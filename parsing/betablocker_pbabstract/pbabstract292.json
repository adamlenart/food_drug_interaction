    "0": "Heart failure affects more than 5 million Americans. Each year, about 400,000 individuals develop heart failure, making it the nation's most rapidly growing cardiac problem. Almost one third of these individuals have New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV heart failure and are faced with progressive clinical deterioration and frequent hospital admissions. These figures will continue to escalate as the population ages. The success of interventional procedures and pharmacologic therapies in the management of coronary artery disease has enabled this population to survive acute events, at the same time creating a population with chronic disease. Common etiologies of heart failure in women include coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and valvular disease. However, women are at especially high risk for developing heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction associated with hypertension and diabetes. Heart failure in women is best managed across the care continuum, incorporating pharmacologic agents, interventional procedures when appropriate, dietary restrictions, self-monitoring, and psychosocial support. Much of the recent literature has focused on women and heart disease. This emphasis is partly due to public misconception about women's health problems and the growing body of research distinguishing gender differences. Significant advances in therapy have been made to improve the quality and span of life for people with heart disease. Despite therapeutic advances, however, women have high mortality rates from heart disease, including heart failure due to ischemic causes. In fact, women with heart failure present differently than men and have different etiologies and treatment options. As we learn more about women and heart disease, the distinguishing differences unfold and become helpful in establishing a plan of care.", 
    "1": "Verapamil poisonings are rare, but are associated with a high proportion of deaths. The authors present a case of acute poisoning by verapamil associated with collapsus and a high degree of heart block. They propose a strategy for therapeutic management based on the study of calcium-channel blocker mechanisms of toxicity.", 
    "2": "Although the renoprotective effect of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) has been examined in several models of hypertensive nephropathy, it remains unclear. It also remains to be clarified whether CCBs prevent the progression to end-stage renal failure in chronic progressive glomerulonephritis (GN). A new rat model of progressive mesangioproliferative GN was used to study the effect of benidipine hydrochloride, a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, on the clinical features and morphological lesions.", 
    "3": "This animal model of progressive GN was induced by a single intravenous injection of anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb 1-22-3) two weeks after unilateral nephrectomy. After 10 weeks of treatment with benidipine (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) or hydralazine (5 mg/kg body weight, p.o.), systolic blood pressure (SBP), urinary protein excretion, creatinine clearance, glomerulosclerosis index, tubulointerstitial lesion index, glomerular cross-sectional area, and glomerular expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were measured.", 
    "4": "Untreated rats developed hypertension, massive proteinuria, renal dysfunction, severe glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, higher glomerular size, and marked glomerular staining for TGF-beta and alpha-SMA, while uninephrectomized control rats did not. Each dose of benidipine and hydralazine equally reduced SBP to uninephrectomized control levels. Three and five mg/kg/day of benidipine increased creatinine clearance, ameliorated glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, and reduced glomerular staining for TGF-beta and alpha-SMA, but 1 mg/kg/day of benidipine and hydralazine failed. Only a dose of 5 mg/kg/day of benidipine reduced glomerular size, although it did not reduce the size to control levels.", 
    "5": "These results indicate that in a rat model of progressive mesangioproliferative GN, benidipine prevents the progression to end-stage renal failure in a dose-dependent manner. This renoprotective action is associated with the suppression of glomerular expression of TGF-beta and alpha-SMA.", 
    "6": "Our aim was to investigate the role of adrenoceptors in the modulation of in vivo interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. The effect of different adrenergic drugs on plasma concentration of IL-10 was measured by ELISA 90 min after LPS injection. Our results confirmed the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors since the beta-agonist isoproterenol significantly increased the IL-10 production in response to LPS stimulation, whereas the beta-antagonists propranolol decreased it. In contrast, the alpha2-agonists UK-14304, clonidine and xylazine significantly decreased the IL-10 plasma level, whereas the alpha2-antagonists CH-38083, prazosine and WB-4101 increased it. Our results provide the first in vivo evidence that, in addition to beta-adrenoceptors; alpha-adrenoceptors play also a very important role in the regulation of IL-10 production under endotoxaemic conditions.", 
    "7": "Timolol was the first beta blocker to be used as an anti-glaucoma agent and to date remains as the standard because none of the newer beta blockers were found to be more effective. The high performance thin layer chromatographic method of analysis of timolol maleate is reported. The mobile phase selected was ethyl acetate-methanol-isopropyl alcohol-ammonia (25%) (80:20:2:1, v/v/v/v). The calibration curve of the drug was linear in the range of 100-600 ng. The spectrodensitometric analysis was carried out at 294 nm. The mean (+/- RSD) values of slope, correlation coefficient and intercept were 2487.5 (+/- 0.9), 0.996 (+/- 0.081) and 90463 (+/- 1.1), respectively. The system precision and the method precision were excellent with an RSD of 2.8 and 1.004, respectively. The limits of detection and quantitation were 10 and 40 ng, respectively. The mean percent recovery was found to be 98.6. Timolol maleate was degraded by exposing the drug to heat, acid and base. The degraded products were found to be well separated from the pure drug with significantly different Rf values suggesting a stability indicating analysis method for quantification of timolol maleate in pharmaceutical preparations and as bulk drug. The method was utilized to analyze timolol maleate from conventional eye drops and novel sustained release solid polymeric ocular inserts and oral preparations. The reported method is simple, selective, precise, accurate, time saving and economic as compared to reported HPLC methods.", 
    "8": "It has been clearly demonstrated that left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is a strong blood pressure independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the general population, in primary and secondary hypertension and in cardiac patients. LV hypertrophy in arterial hypertension develops in response to an increased afterload, but underlying pathophysiological mechanisms include a variety of non-haemodynamic factors. Due to the prognostic importance of LV hypertrophy, normalisation of LV mass emerged as a desirable goal of antihypertensive treatment. Indeed, several prospective studies now indicate that regression of LV hypertrophy reduced cardiovascular complications. As a consequence, the question was raised whether certain antihypertensive drugs differ in their ability to reduce LV mass. Several comparative studies and meta-analyses have been carried out to resolve this issue. The available data seem to indicate that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were more potent than beta-blockers in their ability to reduce LV hypertrophy, with diuretics in the intermediate range. The role of new antihypertensive agents such as angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers appears similar to the one of ACE-inhibitors, since in some studies angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockers were superior to beta-blockers and diuretics. Various aspects of LV hypertrophy including its prevalence, determinants, prognosis and regression are discussed in this article.", 
    "9": "To evaluate the effect of topical timolol on the optic nerve head (ONH) circulation in the cynomolgus monkey.", 
    "10": "Eight cynomolgus monkeys were used. Timolol (0.5%, 30 microL) was instilled twice daily into 1 eye and physiological saline into the other eye for 7 consecutive days. The ONH tissue blood velocity (NB(ONH)) was determined using the laser speckle method. The determinations of NB(ONH) were carried out before the first instillation and 4 hours after the first, the seventh and the last instillation. The IOP was measured periodically. All measurements were performed in a masked manner.", 
    "11": "Twice daily 7-day instillation of 0.5% timolol showed no significant effect on the NB(ONH) in either eye, while the IOP was significantly decreased in both eyes.", 
    "12": "In the cynomolgus monkey, the ONH circulation was not affected by 7-day twice daily topical timolol treatment.", 
    "13": "Chronic opioid regulation of stimulatory receptor activity was investigated in neuroblastoma x glioma (NG108-15) hybrid cells stably transfected to express the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR). Expressed beta(2)-ARs are functionally coupled to G proteins and display ligand-independent signalling activity, as demonstrated by the ability of an inverse agonist to attenuate basal adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. Despite the relative increase in basal AC activity due to the development of tolerance/dependence, chronic morphine treatment was found to completely abolish spontaneous beta(2)-AR activity by reducing basal receptor/G protein precoupling. A similar chronic opioid effect was observed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. These results indicate that during the state of opioid tolerance/dependence basal levels of AC activity are no longer under the control of spontaneously active stimulatory receptors.", 
    "14": "In the present study in dogs, we compared with aminophylline the spasmolytic effects of olprinone, a novel phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, on serotonin-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) and bronchoconstriction. Mongrel dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital. PH and bronchoconstriction were induced with serotonin: 10 microg/kg + 1 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1), and assessed as % changes in pulmonary vascular resistance and bronchial cross-sectional area (basal = 100%). Initially, the relaxant effects of olprinone (n = 8: 0-1000 microg/kg) and aminophylline (n = 8: 0-100 mg/kg) were compared. Pulmonary vascular resistance and bronchial cross-sectional area were assessed before and 30 min after serotonin infusion began and 5 min after each dose of olprinone or aminophylline. We then determined whether propranolol (0.4 mg/kg) reversed the relaxation induced by olprinone (1000 microg/kg, n = 6) or aminophylline (100 mg/kg, n = 6) compared with saline (n = 6 each). Olprinone and aminophylline dose-dependently attenuated both PH and bronchoconstriction (olprinone > aminophylline: -logED(50)[mean] for PH and bronchoconstriction 5.37+/- 0.35[4.24 microg/kg] vs. 1.60+/-0.23[25.4 mg/kg] and 4.06+/-0.12[87.8 microg/kg] vs. 1.51+/-0.21[30.6 mg/kg], respectively). In addition, olprinone produced more potent pulmonary vasodilation than bronchodilation while aminophylline was equipotent. In addition, there was a significant increase in plasma catecholamines after olprinone (> or =100 microg/kg) and aminophylline (> or =10 mg/kg). With the exception of aminophylline-induced bronchodilation, propranolol did not reverse any of the other effects measured. Therefore, the spasmolytic effects of olprinone are independent of plasma catecholamines, while the bronchodilating effect of aminophylline may partially involve increased levels of circulating catecholamines.", 
    "15": "Patients with cirrhosis, especially those who have a platelet count of less than 100,000, who are considered compliant, and have no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy, should have a screening endoscopy to ascertain the presence of esophageal varices. Patients with medium to large esophageal varices who are appropriate candidates should be placed on a nonselective beta-blocker (propranolol hyrdochloride, nadolol, timolol maleate) for the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage. Patients presenting with acute variceal hemorrhage, as determined endoscopically, should be treated with a combination of vasoactive drugs and endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or variceal ligation) for the control of acute variceal bleeding and the prevention of early rebleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should be reserved for failures of initial medical therapy. After successful control of initial variceal bleeding is reached, the rebleeding rate approaches 70% in most studies, with the highest risk period being in the first 6 months after control of the index bleed is obtained. Therefore, all patients should be placed on therapy to prevent recurrent variceal bleeding. Options include pharmacologic therapy, endoscopic therapy, and combinations of endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy. TIPS, surgical shunts, and liver transplantation should be reserved for special circumstances and in general, should only be considered for failures of initial medical therapy.", 
    "16": "Cirrhotic patients should receive an endoscopy. Those with medium to large varices identified by endoscopy should receive beta-blocker therapy. The initial episode of variceal bleeding should be managed with endoscopic therapy to control the acute bleeding and concurrent infusion of octreotide. Portal hypertension and liver disease should be fully evaluated after such an episode, and patients should be started on first-line treatment (endoscopic therapy and pharmacologic therapy) to reduce the risk of further bleeding. Patients who bleed again after first-line therapy, and those with persistent risk factors whose varices are not obliterated by first-line treatment should be considered for second-line treatment, which is variceal decompression with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or surgical shunt. For patients with end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation may be the most appropriate treatment option. The management of variceal bleeding leading up to transplantation depends on the severity of the bleeding and available expertise. Minimal therapy to bridge the patient to transplantation is the goal. Devascularization procedures are reserved for patients who are not candidates for decompression because of venous thrombosis.", 
    "17": "Cardiac arrhythmias are very common in the setting of heart failure, with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias often present in the same patient. The risk and the benefit of antiarrhythmic therapies are still a matter of debate. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided in patients with heart failure, cardiac ischemia, or previous myocardial infarction. Beta-blocker agents reduce morbidity and decrease mortality in patients suffering from moderate to severe heart failure. Amiodarone may be beneficial in patients with advanced heart failure and increased resting heart rates. This class III drug may be effective to suppress episodes of atrial fibrillation but can also be beneficial in reducing ventricular response by slowing atrioventricular conduction during chronic atrial fibrillation. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) markedly reduce sudden cardiac death in patients with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. In patients with advanced heart failure, however, the ICD may not markedly extend survival. Recently analyzed data from the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS), Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) registry, Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT), and Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) have consistently shown that it is the sickest patient who benefits the most from ICD therapy. Patients with markedly depressed ejection fraction (<30%), poor New York Heart Association functional class, and advanced age have been identified as those who really need ICD therapy. Studies of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in patients with moderate to severe heart failure have been launched and will provide necessary answers to the question of whether a reduction in sudden death will translate into a reduction of all-cause mortality. For patients resuscitated from sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, an ICD or, in some cases, amiodarone should be considered. Catheter or surgical ablation can be considered for selected patients with ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "18": "Microemboli caused by mechanical heart valves have the potential to cause cerebrovascular events. We investigated the effects of myocardial contractility and heart rate on microemboli production in association with conventional and experimental mechanical heart valves implanted in the mitral position in a bovine model. In 10 calves, the mitral valves were replaced with mechanical valves. Doppler recordings were analyzed for high-intensity transient signals, which are ultrasound reflections from circulating microemboli. The animals were studied at rest, during pacing at 160 bpm, after dobutamine infusion, and after esmolol infusion. The incidence of high intensity transient signals was expressed as signal frequency (signals per hour) and as signal rate (signals per 100 heart cycles). With a 68% increase in the heart rate, signal frequency increased by 135%, but signal rate increased by only 41 %. With a 144% increase in myocardial contractility, signal rate increased by 264 %. With a 31 % decrease in contractility, signal rate decreased by 62 %. We conclude that microemboli production by mechanical heart valves varies with myocardial contractility and heart rate. The fact that contractility affects the incidence of high-intensity transient signals suggests that the microemboli are gaseous in nature, that their production is pressure driven, and that cavitation is a possible cause. It is likely that mechanical heart valve design is responsible for the quantity of microemboli production.", 
    "19": "The American College of Cardiology-American Heart Association Committee recommends first line beta-adrenergic blocking agents for chronic stable effort angina. This article reassesses some critical evidence that is new or could have been neglected by the Committee. In particular, the putative role of calcium channel blocking agents (CCBs) is reexamined. Additional evidence is culled from articles not cited by the Committee, together with added reference to recent trials. Safety, side-effects and tolerability are issues that are evaluated. Mortality data are reviewed with the aid of a meta-analysis of all placebo-controlled trials on long acting CCBs. The advice of the committee may need to be reconsidered in view of recent evidence on the tolerability and benefits in hypertension of newer, longer-acting, second-generation CCBs. Of the older agents, verapamil has been shown to be the best with regard to safety and efficacy. Especially in the elderly, angina is often associated with hypertension, with evidence showing dihydropyridine CCBs and beta-adrenergic blocking agents to be similarly effective. Beta-blockers may have undesirable side effects such impotence and impaired exercise ability, despite their proven protective effects in postinfarct patients and in heart failure. The choice of drug should be keyed to the needs and the pathophysiology of the individual patient.", 
    "20": "The study compared the adjusted risk for developing atrial fibrillation (AF) after minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery (MIDCAB) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).", 
    "21": "Atrial fibrillation results in increased morbidity and delays hospital discharge after CABG. Recently, MIDCAB has been explored as an alternative to CABG. Because of differences in surgical approach between the two procedures, the incidence of AF may differ.", 
    "22": "Randomly selected patients undergoing CABG and MIDCAB were examined. Baseline variables and postoperative course were recorded through review of medical record data.", 
    "23": "The MIDCAB patients were younger than CABG patients (64+/-12 vs. 67+/-10, p<0.04) and had less extensive coronary artery disease (53% of MIDCAB vs. 3% of CABG had single-vessel disease, while 15% of MIDCAB vs. 69% of CABG had triple-vessel disease, p<0.001 for overall group comparisons). No other differences in clinical or treatment data were noted. Postoperative AF occurred less often after MIDCAB (23% vs. 39%, p = 0.02). Other significant factors associated with postoperative AF included age (p = 0.0024), prior AF (p = 0.0007), left main disease (p = 0.01), number of vessels bypassed (p = 0.009), absence of postoperative beta-blocker therapy (p = 0.0001), and a serious postoperative complication (p = 0.0018). Because of differences between CABG and MIDCAB patients, multivariate logistic analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of postoperative AF. The type of surgery (CABG vs. MIDCAB) was no longer a significant predictor of postoperative AF (estimated relative risk for AF in CABG vs. MIDCAB patients: 1.57, 95% confidence interval (0.82-2.52).", 
    "24": "Although AF appears to be less common after MIDCAB than after CABG, the lower incidence is due to different clinical characteristics of patients undergoing these procedures.", 
    "25": "Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are both effective monotherapy for stable angina. When symptoms persist, these two agents are commonly co-prescribed in the hope that this combination has added benefit compared with monotherapy alone. We investigated the additional efficacy of the calcium antagonists amlodipine and nifedipine when added to bisoprolol in patients with stable angina. Patients were randomised in a multicentre, single-blind study, with crossover of three treatments consisting of bisoprolol 10 mg once daily, bisoprolol plus nifedipine 20 mg twice daily, and bisoprolol plus amlodipine 5 mg once daily. Exercise tests were performed at the end of each four-week study period and the exercise time to onset of angina was assessed. A total of 198 patients from 17 centres were recruited of whom 147 were evaluable for efficacy. There were no statistically significant differences in exercise duration to onset of angina between any of the groups. The combination of bisoprolol plus nifedipine was least well tolerated. In summary, this study suggests there is little benefit in adding a calcium antagonist to bisoprolol in treating patients with stable angina.", 
    "26": "Unstable angina is a common condition that presents a challenge to physicians because of its complex pathophysiology, and because of the high incidence of associated death and myocardial infarction. This article summarizes key strategies that can be employed in managing unstable angina and describes their interaction with the mechanisms that underpin the condition.", 
    "27": "The regulatory pathways involved in the rapid response of the AP-1 transcription factor, c-fos, to mechanical load in human primary osteoblast-like (HOB) cells and the human MG-63 bone cell line were investigated using a four-point bending model. HOB and MG-63 cells showed upregulation of c-fos expression on fibronectin and collagen type I substrates; however, MG-63 cells did not respond on laminin YIGSR substrates. Addition of cytochalasin D and Arg-Gly-Asp peptides during loading did not inhibit the response, whereas addition of beta(1)-integrin antibodies inhibited the load response. The role of Ca(2+) signaling has been demonstrated by blocking upregulation with addition of 2 mM EGTA, which chelates extracellular Ca(2+), and gadolinium (10 microM), which inhibits stretch-activated channels. Addition of the Ca(2+) ionophore A-23187 induced upregulation without loading; however, addition of nifedipine (10 microM), the L-type channel blocker, failed to prevent the load response. Inhibitors of downstream pathways indicated the involvement of protein kinase C. Our results demonstrate a key involvement of Ca(2+) signaling pathways and integrin binding in the c-fos response to mechanical strain.", 
    "28": "Potassium channels encoded by HERG underlie I:(Kr), a sensitive target for most class III antiarrhythmic drugs, including methanesulfonanilides such as Dd-sotalol. Recently it was shown that these drugs are trapped in the channel as it closes during hyperpolarization. At the same time, HERG channels rapidly open and inactivate when depolarized, and methanesulfonanilide block is known to develop in a use-dependent manner, suggesting a potential role for inactivation in drug binding. However, the role of HERG inactivation in class III drug action is uncertain: pore mutations that remove inactivation reduce block, yet many of these mutations also modify the channel permeation properties and could alter drug affinity through gating-independent mechanisms. In the present study, we identify a definitive role for inactivation gating in Dd-sotalol block of HERG, using interventions complementary to mutagenesis. These interventions (addition of extracellular Cd(2+), removal of extracellular Na(+)) modify the voltage dependence of inactivation but not activation. In normal extracellular solutions, block of HERG current by 300 micromol/L Dd-sotalol reached 80% after a 10-minute period of repetitive depolarization to +20 mV. Maneuvers that impeded steady-state inactivation also reduced Dd-sotalol block of HERG: 100 micromol/L Cd(2+) reduced steady-state block to 55% at +20 mV (P:<0.05); removing extracellular Na(+) reduced block to 44% (P:<0.05). An inactivation-disabling mutation (G628C-S631C) reduced Dd-sotalol block to only 11% (P:<0.05 versus wild type). However, increasing the rate of channel inactivation by depolarizing to +60 mV reduced Dd-sotalol block to 49% (P:<0.05 versus +20 mV), suggesting that the drug does not primarily bind to the inactivated state. Coexpression of MiRP1 with HERG had no effect on inactivation gating and did not modify Dd-sotalol block. We postulate that Dd-sotalol accesses its receptor in the open pore, and the drug-receptor interaction is then stabilized by inactivation. Whereas deactivation traps the bound methanesulfonanilide during hyperpolarization, we propose that HERG inactivation stabilizes the drug-receptor interaction during membrane depolarization.", 
    "29": "Throughout the 1990s, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended initial antihypertensive therapy with a thiazide diuretic or a beta-blocker based on evidence from randomized, controlled trials, unless an indication existed for another drug class. The committee also recommended beta-blockers in hypertensive patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Our objective was to determine whether prescribing practices for older hypertensive patients are consistent with evidence-based guidelines.", 
    "30": "We examined prescription patterns from January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1995 for 23,748 patients 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of hypertension from the New Jersey Medicaid program and that state's Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled program (PAAD). We linked drug use data with information on demographic variables and comorbid medical conditions.", 
    "31": "During the study period, calcium channel blockers were the most commonly prescribed initial therapy for hypertension (41%), followed by ACE inhibitors (24%), thiazide diuretics (17%), and beta-blockers (10%). Eliminating patients with diabetes mellitus, CHF, angina, or history of MI did not substantially affect these results. Overall, initial use of a thiazide declined from 22% in 1991 to 10% in 1995, while initial use of a calcium channel blocker increased from 28% to 43%, despite publication during these years of studies demonstrating a benefit of thiazides in older patients. Only 15% of older hypertensive patients with a history of MI received beta-blockers.",

    "33": "beta-Adrenergic-blocking agents underwent extensive research over the past 2 decades and emerged as a proven state-of-art therapy for the failing human heart. Through blockade of chronically elevated cardiac adrenergic stimulation, selective and nonselective agents with vasodilating properties prevent progression of myocardial dysfunction and cardiac remodeling. Most important, beta-adrenergic blockers added to conventional therapy of vasodilators and diuretics significantly increase survival to a 5-year rate similar to that of cardiac transplantation. The agents also significantly reduce hospitalizations, improve quality of life, and are well tolerated in clinical trials. The challenge in treating heart failure is to ensure that every eligible patient receives these life-saving drugs.", 
    "34": "Angiotensin II and norepinephrine (NE) have been implicated in the neurohumoral response to pressure overload and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy. The purpose of this study was to determine the temporal sequence for activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems in the rat after 3-60 days of pressure overload induced by aortic constriction. Initially on pressure overload, there was transient activation of the systemic renin-angiotensin system coinciding with the appearance of left ventricular hypertrophy (day 3). At day 10, there was a marked increase in AT(1) receptor density in the left ventricle, increased plasma NE concentration, and elevated cardiac epinephrine content. Moreover, the inotropic response to isoproterenol was reduced in the isolated, perfused heart at 10 days of pressure overload. The affinity of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor in the left ventricle was decreased at 60 days. Despite these alterations, there was no decline in resting left ventricular function, beta-adrenergic receptor density, or the relative distribution of beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptor sites in the left ventricle over 60 days of pressure overload. Thus activation of the renin-angiotensin system is an early response to pressure overload and may contribute to the initial development of cardiac hypertrophy and sympathetic activation in the compensated heart.", 
    "35": "The mechanisms of the beta-adrenoceptor mediated relaxation induced by epinephrine in guinea pig taenia caecum were examined. The relaxant response to epinephrine was unaffected by propranolol (approximately 10(-5) M) or phentolamine (approximately 10(-5) M). The response to epinephrine was antagonized in a concentration dependent manner by bupranolol, and Schild plot of the data revealed the pA2 value of 5.87. Epinephrine significantly increased cyclic AMP level in this preparation. Bupranolol (10(-4) M) significantly decreased the cyclic AMP level that was elicited by epinephrine, whereas propranolol (10(-5) M) produced no effect. These results suggest that the relaxant response to epinephrine in the guinea pig taenai caecum is mainly mediated by beta3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "36": "We previously developed an in vivo pharmacokinetic model that accounts for the corneal diffusion in albino rabbits and predicts the concentration of beta-blockers in the anterior segments. The purpose of this study is to pharmacokinetically predict the ocular absorption and characterize the systemic absorption of instilled drug with ophthalmic viscous vehicle to assist in its design and evaluation. Tilisolol and carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) were used as the model ophthalmic drug and viscous polymer, respectively. After instillation of tilisolol with CMC vehicle in rabbits, the disposition of the drug in tear fluid, aqueous humor, and plasma were determined by HPLC. The ocular and systemic absorption were analyzed by a mathematical model including a diffusion process and a two-compartment model with first-order absorption, respectively. CMC vehicle increased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of tilisolol in the tear fluid and aqueous humor and slightly reduced the AUC in plasma. The concentrations of tilisolol in the aqueous humor after instillation with CMC vehicle were accurately predicted from the tear concentrations by using the in vivo ocular pharmacokinetic model. CMC vehicle improved the ocular delivery of tilisolol.", 
    "37": "The pharmacokinetics characteristics of propranolol (PPL) in horses was studied by administering the drug intravenously or orally to the animals. The predominant primary pathway was ring oxidation, and 4-hydroxypropranolol glucuronide (4-OHPG) was the major metabolite in both plasma and urine. Side-chain glucuronidation and oxidation were not significant. A two-compartment model was employed for PPL followed by a one-compartment model for 4-OHPG. After oral administration, one-step absorption and two-step first pass metabolism were employed. The fraction absorbed of PPL was approximately 70% after oral administration, and the bioavailability varied among individual horses from 1 to 79% depending on the first pass metabolism. The biologic half-life (T1/2) of PPL obeys the allometric equation in some animal species including rats and horses, except for human. T 1/2 of PPL in horses was approximately 2 h.", 
    "38": "The beta-adrenergic system is very important in cardiovascular medicine. Thyroid hormone (T3) affects beta-adrenergic receptors. In cell culture, isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, has been shown to upregulate thyroid hormone receptor (TR) mRNA, thus indicating a bi-directional regulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate if beta-adrenoreceptor blockade may affect subtype TR mRNA expression in vivo. Propranolol or vehicle was delivered by implanting an Alzet osmotic pump subcutaneously in mice for 14d. The concentration of TRalpha1, alpha2, beta1 and beta2 subtype mRNA concentrations were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and ELISA. Propranolol downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 by 44% (p < 0.0005) and beta1 mRNA by 39% (p < 0.0005) in mouse heart, in comparison to the control, while no difference in the TRalpha2 or beta2 mRNA levels occurred.

Under the same conditions, the IC(50) value for Trolox C was 18.8 microM. At the same concentration range showing antioxidant activity both compounds prevent the collapse of transmembranar electric potential induced by ADP/Fe(2+) on respiring mitochondria. Furthermore, both carvedilol and BM-910228 do not display toxic effects on mitochondria up to the concentration showing maximal antioxidant effects ( approximately 40 microM for carvedilol and approximately 1 microM for BM-910228). At higher concentrations of carvedilol (>40 microM), however, the phosphorylation efficiency of mitochondria is depressed as deduced from a decrease in respiratory control and in the ADP/oxygen ratio. The Brand approach was used to assess the effects of carvedilol on oxidative phosphorylation. We found that carvedilol stimulated membrane proton leak and inhibited substrate oxidation, but had no measurable effect on phosphorylation reactions. Because carvedilol exerts its antioxidant properties for nontoxic concentrations, its therapeutic interest is reinforced because it may potentially prevent mitochondrial dysfunctions associated to cell death in several pathophysiological states where excessive production of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria is well documented (e.g., ischemia/reperfusion). Additionally, its hydroxylated analog BM-910228 with notable superior antioxidant activity may significantly contribute to the known therapeutic effects of carvedilol.",

Isolated rat hearts were perfused initially by the Langendorff mode with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) for 15 minutes in the absence (control) or presence of losartan (4.5 micromol/L) and/or HOE 140 (10 micromol/L). After conversion to the working mode for 10 minutes (baseline), randomly assigned control and experimental hearts were subjected to 30 minutes of normothermic global ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Myocardial function, infarct size, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and amount of bradykinin/angiotensin released from the hearts were measured at baseline and during reperfusion while in the working mode. Significant postischemic ventricular recovery was demonstrated by improved developed pressure and aortic flow and reduced myocardial infarct size and apoptotic cell death with losartan, whereas the reverse was true for HOE 140. The functional recovery and infarct size-lowering ability of losartan were partially blocked and the antiapoptotic function of losartan was completely blocked by HOE 140.",

ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product criteria was present in 5791 patients (65.9%) and by Sokolow-Lyon voltage in 2025 patients (23.1%). Compared with patients without ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product criteria, patients with ECG LVH by this method were older; more obese; more likely to be female, white, and to have never smoked; more likely to be diabetic and have angina; and had slightly higher systolic, diastolic, and pulse blood pressures. In contrast, patients with ECG LVH by Sokolow-Lyon criteria were slightly younger; less obese; more likely to be male, black, and current smokers; less likely to have diabetes; more likely to have angina and a history of cerebrovascular disease; and had higher systolic and pulse blood pressure but slightly lower diastolic blood pressure than patients without ECG LVH by this method. By use of multivariate logistic regression analyses, presence of ECG LVH by Cornell voltage-duration product criteria was predominantly associated with higher body mass index, increased age, and female gender, whereas presence of ECG LVH by Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria was predominantly related to lower body mass index, male gender, and black race. Thus, hypertensive patients who meet Cornell product and Sokolow-Lyon voltage criteria are associated with different, but potentially equally adverse, risk factor profiles.", 
    "63": "1. To investigate the effects of the clove oil constituents beta-caryophyllene oxide and eugenol on the heart muscle, experiments were performed on isolated papillary muscles and on ventricular myocytes of the guinea-pig. The results were compared with those obtained with the dihydropyridine, nifedipine. 2. All three substances exerted negative inotropic effects in heart muscle although with different potencies and different influences on the time course of the contraction curve. 3. They all reduced rested-state contractions (RSCs) in the presence of isoprenaline which are thought to be due to the Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)). 4. beta-Caryophyllene oxide, eugenol and nifedipine inhibited the I(Ca) in single cells from the guinea-pig ventricle in a concentration-dependent, reversible way, but with different potencies. 5. In addition to the I(Ca)-inhibiting effect, beta-caryophyllene oxide strongly inhibited and eugenol slightly inhibited the potassium current. 6. The action potential of papillary muscles at a 1 Hz contraction frequency was greatly shortened by nifedipine, slightly shortened by eugenol, but not changed by beta-caryophyllene oxide. 7. The inhibition of the potassium current by beta-caryophyllene oxide obviously prevents a shortening of the action potential due to the diminution of the I(Ca). Accordingly, the negative inotropic effect of beta-caryophyllene oxide is closely related to the inhibition of I(Ca). In contrast, eugenol and nifedipine, which shorten the action potential, exert stronger negative inotropic effects than expected from their influence on I(Ca). 8. The results show that the negative inotropic effect of a calcium channel blocker can be attenuated by an additional inhibition of potassium channels.",

This has come about with the recognition that the majority of patients who present to the hospital with chest pain have unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI). Further, sensitive biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis, such as troponin and creatine kinase, have improved early diagnosis. Markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), although not in wide clinical practice, may provide an early and important marker of prognosis. The current approach to management of acute coronary syndromes is careful risk stratification so as to select appropriate medical therapies and to guide the clinician to appropriate interventions such as angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Established therapies such as aspirin, heparin, intravenous nitrates, and, in selected patients, beta blockers or calcium antagonists, are being used concomitantly with, or are being supplanted by, newer therapies such as low-molecular-weight heparins and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

    "70": "The management of arrhythmias during pregnancy is, in principle, similar to that in nonpregnant patients, however, special consideration must be given, to avoid adverse fetal effects. In pregnant women without organic heart disease, no drug therapy is usually needed for the management of supraventricular or ventricular premature beats, but potential stimulants, such as smoking, caffeine, and alcohol should be eliminated. In patients with mitral valve prolapse beta blocker may be preferred drug. In pregnant patients with organic heart disease, paroxysmal atrial or ventricular tachycardia may induce hemodynamic changes with consequences to the fetus. In paroxysmal atrial tachycardia vagal stimulation maneuvers should tried and, if this is not effective, adenosine or beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be used. Alternatively, verapamil may be given. In pregnant with atrial fibrillation, the goal of treatment is conversion to sinus rhythm or control of the ventricular rate by digoxin. Synchronized electrical cardioversion may become necessary when signs of cardiac decompensation or hypotension were developed. Ventricular arrhythmias may occur in the pregnant women with cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, mitral valve prolapse and congenital Q-T prolongation. Termination of ventricular arrhythmias can usually be achieved by intravenous lignocaine or procainamide or by electrical cardioversion. To prevent recurrences, quinidine can be used if the arrhythmia was not induced by QT prolongation or procainamide.",

The equations' parameters characterise properties of the effector system under study: the number of receptor pools differing in their affinity to a ligand; the number of active receptors of the maximum response magnitude; and the number of ligand's molecules bound to the receptor. The derived parameter's efficiency provides a general characteristic of affinity for the effector system under study.

When the device was implanted, assessment of the ability to defibrillate induced ventricular fibrillation showed high energy requirements, with a lack of conventional safety margin between energies effective at defibrillation testing and maximal device output. Treatment with oral amiodarone was withdrawn and substituted with oral sotalol. A repeat defibrillation test, performed 54 days after amiodarone withdrawal and during D,L -sotalol treatment, showed a reduction in defibrillation energy requirements. In view of this experience, replacement of amiodarone treatment with an alternate class III agent (D,L -sotalol or other agents, if available) can be considered as a possible option in case of high defibrillation threshold at the time of the implantation in a patient receiving continuous amiodarone treatment.", 
    "77": "Autonomic cardiovascular control was characterized in conscious, chronically catheterized mice by spectral analysis of arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) during autonomic blockade or baroreflex modulation of autonomic tone. Both spectra were similar to those obtained in humans, but at approximately 10x higher frequencies. The 1/f relation of the AP spectrum changed to a more shallow slope below 0.1-0.2 Hz. Coherence between AP and HR reached 0.5 or higher below 0.3-0.4 Hz and also above 2.5 Hz. Muscarinic blockade (atropine) or beta-adrenergic blockade (atenolol) did not significantly affect the AP spectrum. Atropine reduced HR variability at all frequencies, but this effect waned above 1 Hz. beta-Adrenergic blockade (atenolol) slightly enhanced the HR variability only above 1 Hz. alpha-Adrenergic blockade (prazosin) reduced AP variability between 0.05 and 3 Hz, most prominently at 0. 15-0.7 Hz. A shift of the autonomic nervous tone by a hypertensive stimulus (phenylephrine) enhanced, whereas a hypotensive stimulus (nitroprusside) depressed AP variability at 1-3 Hz; other frequency ranges of the AP spectrum were not affected except for a reduction below 0.4 Hz after nitroprusside. Variability of HR was enhanced after phenylephrine at all frequencies and reduced after nitroprusside. As with atropine, the reduction with nitroprusside waned above 1 Hz. In conclusion, in mice HR variability is dominated by parasympathetic tone at all frequencies, during both blockade and physiological modulation of autonomic tone. There is a limitation for further reduction but not for augmentation of HR variability from the resting state above 1 Hz. The impact of HR on AP variability in mice is confined to frequencies higher than 1 Hz. Limits between frequency ranges are proposed as 0.15 Hz between VLF (very low frequency range) and LF (low frequency range) and 1.5 Hz between LF and HF (high frequency range).",

To test whether this difference was due to endogenous catecholamines, dogs were pretreated with propranolol (controls only) or the specific beta 2-antagonist ICI 118,551 prior to histamine infusion. After beta-blockade, histamine significantly reduced sigma in both control (0.83 +/- 0.01 to 0.55 +/- 0.05) and paced (0.83 +/- 0.01 to 0.57 +/- 0.07) groups (p < 0.05).",

The safety and efficacy of new and old treatment protocols were retrospectively compared for patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "109": "The new protocol used transradial intervention, encouraged stent implantation, beta-blocker administration, and rapid mobilization for rapid discharge (10-14 day hospital stay). The previous protocol used transfemoral intervention, bed rest and late mobilization, and discouraged stent implantation and beta-blocker supplementation. High risk patients with cardiogenic shock, left main disease, malignant arrhythmia and impending myocardial rupture were excluded from the study.", 
    "110": "Thirty-two patients were treated by the new protocol, and 57 patients by the old protocol. The former included more elderly patients (p < 0.05). The prevalence of beta-blocker use (63.3% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001) and stent implantation (43.8% vs 3.5%, p < 0.05) were higher in the new protocol group. Hospital stay (23.6 +/- 9.5 vs 13.3 +/- 5.9 days, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit stay (4.4 +/- 3.0 vs 2.4 +/- 1.2 days, p < 0.001) were shorter in the new protocol than in the old protocol group. Rates of in-hospital death, cardiac events, systemic complications and left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index at admission and discharge) were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The prevalence of systemic complications (including delirium) among patients older than 70 years was lower in the new protocol group (4.7% vs 11.7%, p < 0.05).", 
    "111": "The new protocol can shorten hospital stay with no increase in in-hospital death or cardiac events, or decline of left ventricular function. Moreover, the new protocol is potentially effective for reducing systemic complications among elderly patients.

    "112": "Surfactants suppress the electrospray ionization (ESI) of various compounds. Here we demonstrate that fluorinated surfactants such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOSA) could be employed for ESI-MS without a significant decrease in sensitivity. Both PFOA and PFOSA could be applied to the analysis of ionic and nonionic compounds by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC)/ESI-MS, although the migration window was limited. Furthermore, in HPLC/ESI-MS, PFOA could function as a paired ion for enzymatically digested peptides as well as sulfonamides and significant effects of PFOA on the signal peak shape, retention times, and sensitivity of the analytes were observed compared to those of trifluoroacetic acid or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In addition, PFOA was applied to protein analysis by ESI-MS, and superior sensitivity was noted, compared to other surfactants such as octylglucoside, dodecylglucoside, and SDS. Although 21% of the original signal was observed in the presence of 1% PFOA, this surfactant could be easily removed by evaporation, which resulted in the recovery of 96% of the original signal. Because these fluorinated surfactants could also be used for solubilization, extraction, and disaggregation of proteins, they should greatly expand the applicability of the ESI-MS to the biological problems of proteins.", 
    "113": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) plays an important role in atherogenesis. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the effects of the third generation beta-blockers nebivolol and carvedilol on ET-1 liberation, preproendothelin-1 production and on proliferation of human coronary cells. Human coronary endothelial (HEC) and smooth muscle cells (HCSMC) were grown with carvedilol or nebivolol (10(-7)-10(-5) mol/l). Incubation for 1, 2 or 7 days resulted in an 80% concentration- and time-dependent reduction in HCSMC proliferation. beta-blockers such as propranolol or metoprolol did not influence cell proliferation. Nebivolol (10(-7) mol/l) inhibited accelerated HCSMC proliferation in the presence of growth factors such as transforming growth factor-beta1 or platelet-derived growth factor BB. During incubation with nebivolol or carvedilol ET-1 secretion decreased. For nebivolol this is a result of a reduction in preproendothelin-1 mRNA levels. beta-blockers of the third generation that reduce the cell proliferation and ET-1 secretion may represent strategies with great promise for antiproliferative therapy of coronary heart disease.", 
    "114": "Endocardial endothelium is far less studied than its systemic and pulmonary counterparts and its role in cardiac function is not well known. In the study reported here, we succeeded in isolating and culturing endocardial endothelial cells (EECs) from 21-week-old human fetal heart and verified whether endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptors are present on these cells and whether their activation regulates cytosolic ([Ca]c) and nuclear calcium ([Ca]n). Using fluo-3 Ca2+ measurement and three-dimension confocal microscopy techniques, superfusion of fetal human EECs from right and left ventricles with increasing concentrations of ET-1 induced a dose-dependent sustained increase of free cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ levels with an EC50 near 10(-10) M and 10(-11) M, respectively. The sustained increase of cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ by ET-1 in both EEC preparations was completely blocked by the calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) but was insensitive to the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine. The effect of ET-1 was prevented by the ET(A)-receptor antagonist BQ 123. However the ET(B)-receptor antagonist BQ 788 had no effect. Our results suggest that ET-1 receptors are present in human EECs and that their stimulation induces sustained Ca2+ influx through ET(A)-receptor stimulation of a nifedipine-insensitive Ca2+ channel, probably the R-type Ca2+ channel. The presence of Ca2+-dependent responses to ET-1 supports a possible modulatory role of the endocardial endothelium in myocardial functions.", 
    "115": "We have recently shown that endothelin-1 (ET-1) activates two types of Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels (designated NSCC-1 and NSCC-2) and store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOCC). These channels can be pharmacologically discriminated using 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1-H-imidazoe l hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) (a blocker of NSCC-2 and SOCC) and (RS)-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline-1-gamma l)-2-phenyl-N,N-di-[2-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamide (LOE 908) (a blocker of NSCC-1 and NSCC-2). For our study we characterized Ca2+ channels involved in ET-1-induced contractions and increases in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) using these blockers. Our results show that the response to lower concentrations of ET-1 involves only one Ca2+ channel which is sensitive to SK&F 96365 and LOE 908 (NSCC-2). In contrast, the response to higher concentrations of ET-1 involves two types of Ca2+ channel in addition to NSCC-2: one is sensitive to SK&F 96365 but resistant to LOE 908 (SOCC), and the other is resistant to SK&F 96365 but sensitive to LOE 908 (NSCC-1). Furthermore, the percentage contribution of Ca2+ entry through NSCC-1, NSCC-2 and SOCC is calculated to be 10%, 50-60% and 30-40%, respectively.", 
    "116": "The 10-year results of randomized trials comparing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and medical treatment are not available yet. The aim of this evaluation was to compare our 10-year follow-up results after PTCA in patients with single-vessel CAD with the 10-year follow-up results after CABG and medical treatment in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) trial. We evaluated the clinical outcome of 509 patients with single-vessel CAD 10 years after coronary angioplasty. The data were compared with the results of 214 patients with single-vessel CAD after CABG or medical treatment from the CASS trial. End points were defined as death and myocardial infarction. Statistical evaluation was performed by life-table analysis and 2-sided Fisher's exact test. The rate of survival was 86% 10 years after PTCA compared with 85% after CABG and 82% after medical treatment in patients from the CASS trial (p = NS). Survival free from myocardial infarction was 77% after coronary angioplasty, 70% after CABG, and 72% after medical treatment (p = NS). Thus, in patients with single-vessel CAD, infarct-free survival 10 years after coronary angioplasty compared favorably with the results after bypass surgery or medical treatment from the CASS trial.", 
    "117": "In acute myocardial infarction (AMI), immediate beta-blocker therapy reduces the incidence of reinfarction and recurrent chest pain in patients receiving tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Data from the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-2 trial also raises the possibility that such therapy may reduce the rate of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). We reviewed data obtained from 60,329 patients treated with t-PA who were enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2. Of the 60,329 in the study cohort, 23,749 patients (39.4%) were treated with immediate beta-blocker therapy and 542 patients (0.9%) developed an ICH. In a multivariate model that included all covariates known to be associated with the development of ICH, immediate beta-blocker therapy was associated with a 31% reduction in the ICH rate (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence intervals 0.57 to 0.84). Thus, in the present study, the use of immediate beta-blocker therapy in patients with AMI treated with t-PA was associated with a significant reduction in ICH. This finding supports the observations made in the TIMI 2 trial and serves to reinforce the recommendations made by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force that immediate beta-blocker therapy should be administered to all patients with AMI who do not have contraindications to this therapy.",

To examine the precise interaction between a blocker and the transporters, we synthesized the optically pure isomers (L- and D-TBOA) and its erythro-isomers. L-TBOA is the most potent blocker for the human excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT1-3), while D-TBOA revealed a difference in the pharmacophores between EAAT1 and EAAT3. We also synthesized the substituent variants (methyl or naphthylmethyl derivatives) of L-TBOA. The results obtained here suggest that bulky substituents are crucial for non-transportable blockers.",

After 3 months, patients were retrospectively stratified into those receiving beta-blockers plus ACE-I (Group A, n = 126), ACE-I (Group B, n = 135), and ACE-I plus intravenous support (Group C, n = 57). Endpoint 1 of the study was combined urgent heart transplantation, mechanical assist device implantation, and pretransplant death during a follow-up of 12 to 48 (mean 19 +/- 11) months. Endpoint 2 was posttransplant mortality up to 48 (mean 14 +/- 8) months.", 
    "122": "In the pretransplantation period the survival rate was 58% and the mortality rate was 20%. Between Groups A and B there was a significant difference in mortality (9% vs 27%, p = 0.001) due to a lower sudden-death rate in Group A (6% vs 17%, p < 0.01). While between Groups A and C all event rates of Endpoint 1 differed significantly, between Group C and Group B total mortality (30% vs 27%) was similar. However, in Group C urgent heart transplantation (HTx) was more often performed than in Group B (54% vs 11%, p < 0.0001). Seventy of 318 patients (22%) underwent heart transplantation (16% urgent, 6% elective). Posttransplant actuarial survival of the entire transplanted cohort (n = 70, 12 deaths) was significantly lower (log rank p < 0.01) than event-free survival in Group A (n = 126, 18 events), significantly higher (log rank p < 0. 0001) than event-free survival in Group C (n = 57, 34 events), and similar to that in Group B (n = 135, 52 events).",

    "124": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) shortens the atrial effective refractory period (ERP) and predisposes to further episodes of AF. The acute changes in atrial refractoriness may be related to tachycardia-induced intracellular calcium overload. The purpose of this study was to determine whether digoxin, which increases intracellular calcium, potentiates the acute effects of AF on atrial refractoriness in humans.", 
    "125": "In 38 healthy adults, atrial ERP was measured at basic drive cycle lengths (BDCLs) of 350 and 500 ms after autonomic blockade. Nineteen patients had been treated with digoxin for 2 weeks. After a several-minute episode of AF, atrial ERP was measured serially at alternating BDCLs. Compared with pre-AF ERPs, the first post-AF ERPs were significantly shorter in both the digoxin and the control groups (P:<0.001). The post-AF ERP at a BDCL of 350 ms shortened to a greater degree in the digoxin group (37+/-16 ms) than in the control group (20+/-13 ms, P:<0.001); similar changes occurred at a BDCL of 500 ms. During post-AF determinations of the atrial ERP, secondary AF episodes occurred significantly more often in the digoxin group (32% versus 16%; P:<0. 04).", 
    "126": "After a brief episode of AF, digoxin augments the shortening that occurs in atrial refractoriness and predisposes to the reinduction of AF. These effects occur in the setting of autonomic blockade and therefore are more likely to be due to the effects of digoxin on intracellular calcium than to its vagotonic effects.", 
    "127": "Cardiovascular control in cold-acclimated freshwater turtles during chronic anoxic exposure is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the observed bradycardia in Trachemys scripta results from increased cholinergic inhibitory tone and reduced sympathetic activity. Cardiovascular status was measured in vivo in turtles acclimated to either 22 degrees C or 5 degrees C and either acutely exposed (6 h) to anoxia at 22 degrees C or chronically exposed (22 days) to anoxia at 5 degrees C. In 22 degrees C-acclimated turtles, injection of the cholinergic antagonist atropine induced a significant tachycardia under both normoxic and anoxic conditions. However, in 5 degrees C-acclimated turtles, atropine injection had little effect on heart rate. Therefore, cholinergic control of heart rate was suppressed during cold acclimation; instead, temperature effects are more important in bringing about bradycardia, while the intrinsic effects of anoxia and acidosis are probably important during chronic anoxia. Injection of adrenaline caused a pressor response through increased systemic resistance at both acclimation temperatures. This response was blunted by acute and chronic anoxic exposure, suggesting that systemic vasomotor control was altered independently of acclimation temperature. This anoxic blunting may be related in part to the anoxia-induced increase in systemic resistance. Injection of nadolol after atropine decreased systemic cardiac output. The tonic beta-adrenergic cardiac stimulation was attenuated by acute and chronic anoxic exposure. Some of this attenuation of beta-adrenergic control could be attributed to the 39-40 % reduction in cell surface beta-adrenoreceptor density in the ventricles of these turtles that accompanied acute and chronic anoxic exposure. In conclusion and contrary to our original hypothesis, cholinergic and adrenergic control of the cardiovascular system in turtles was attenuated under cold anoxic conditions, perhaps assisting in the depressed physiological state of these animals.", 
    "128": "BmP02 is a 28-amino acid residue peptide purified from the venom of the Chinese scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch, which had been demonstrated to be a weak blocker of apamin-sensitive calcium-activated potassium channels. Two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy techniques were used to determine the solution structure of BmP02. The results show that BmP02 formed a alpha/beta scorpion fold, the typical three-dimensional structure adopted by most short chain scorpion toxins whose structures have been determined. However, in BmP02 this alpha/beta fold was largely distorted. The alpha-helix was shortened to only one turn, and the loop connecting the helix to the first beta-strand exhibited conformational heterogeneity. The instability of BmP02 could be attributed to a proline at position 17, which is usually a glycine. Because the residue at this position makes intense contact with the alpha-helix, it was supposed that the bulky side chain of proline had pushed the helix away from the beta-sheet. This had a significant influence on the structure and function of BmP02. The alpha-helix rotated by about 40 degrees to avoid Pro17 while forming two disulfides with the second beta-strand. The rotation further caused both ends of the helix to be unwound due to covalent restrictions. According to its structure, BmP02 was supposed to interact with its target via the side chains of Lys11 and Lys13.",

    "137": "Coronary artery disease is still the no. 1 killer in the developed countries and must thus be detected and treated at an earlier stage. If coronary artery disease is advanced, patients have to be examined regarding the need for revascularization. For secondary prevention, of course, an optimal change of life style and optimal medical treatment of risk factors is mandatory. Independent of the optimal risk factor modification, all of these patients (according to the rules of evidence-based medicine) should take ASA, statins, beta blockers and ACE-inhibitors, if no contraindications or intolerance are present. Therefore, the problem in secondary prevention is not how to identify these patients, but rather how to fulfill their needs. In our own survey in patients with known coronary artery disease referred for PTCA (including patients with post myocardial infarction previous PTCA or bypass surgery), only 89% were on ASA (or clopidogrel), 51% on lipid lowering drugs (46% on statins), 65% on beta blockers, and only 43% had an ACE-inhibitor (MUNICH data in Figures 1 to 4). The analysis of published literature is also depicted in Figures 1 to 4. Until 1996, patients with known coronary artery disease took ASA in only 26% of the cases but later on it was 77 to 100% (Figure 1). Lipid lowering drugs (especially statins) are prescribed in only 13 to 77% (Figure 2), beta blockers in only 30 to 80% (Figure 3) and ACE-inhibitors in only 10 to 72% (Figure 4). In 2 major studies, a decrease in the rate of intake of these drugs during the follow-up years has been documented. The \"ideal tablet\" for secondary prevention contains ASA (100 mg), a statin (e.g. for most statins 40 to 80 mg), a beta blocker (e.g. metoprolol 100 mg or bisoprolol 10 mg) and an ACE-inhibitor (e.g. ramipril 10 mg). So this ideal \"SPM\" (\"secondary prevention mix\") tablet contains 160 to 300 mg of drugs. In conclusion, the analysis of published data for Europe and the USA shows that--in contrast to the statements of politicians and health care insurance companies--we are not overtreating but rather undertreating our patients regarding medications for secondary prevention.",

Several studies have indicated that many patients with AMI and congestive heart failure do not receive appropriate medical treatment while hospitalized. In some cases, there is resistance among clinicians to change aspects of care--particularly prescribing habits. We sought to improve the use of aspirin and beta-blocker therapy for patients diagnosed with AMI and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for patients with congestive heart failure. We found the use of a registry that collects data on patients and their care and generates reports for system review is helpful in measuring improvement in delivery of care.", 
    "139": "Recent studies of the visual cortex in patients with migraine have generally concluded that migraine (particularly migraine with aura) is associated with a state of functional cortical hyperexcitability. The mechanisms giving rise to this hyperexcitability have hitherto been unclear. This paper reports two studies that used a novel investigative technique, derived from basic research in vision science, to examine specific deficits of inhibitory processing in primary visual cortex. The technique is termed the metacontrast test, and it examines visual masking under highly specified conditions. In Study 1, 12 migraine with aura patients (MA), 12 age-matched migraine without aura patients (MO) and 12 age- and sex-matched headache-free control subjects (C) were compared using the metacontrast test. MA patients were significantly less susceptible to visual masking in the metacontrast test than both MO and C groups: this result is highly consistent with a deficit in cortical inhibitory processing in MA patients. Study 2 examined MA patients taking a variety of migraine prophylactics, again using the metacontrast test. Test results normalized in those MA patients taking sodium valproate, but not in those taking other prophylactics. Sodium valproate is a GABA-A agonist that is known to cross the blood-brain barrier: GABA-ergic networks act as the primary inhibitory mechanism in visual cortex. Taken together, the results of these studies argue that cortical hyperexcitability, at least in MA patients, is likely to be a result of deficient intracortical inhibitory processes.",

    "155": "Rapid lowering of blood pressure can precipitate or worsen ischemic strokes. This usually has been observed in the setting of profoundly lowered pressure and hypotension. We report on six patients in whom ischemic neurologic injury ensued or worsened after moderate reduction of blood pressure by pharmacological treatment. The 6 patients suffered new or worsened ischemic neurologic deficits after receiving oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications, mostly after relatively small doses. Mean arterial blood pressure in these patients was decreased by 25 +/- 7.7%, or 37 +/- 16 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) without resultant hypotension. These cases emphasize the potential hazards of moderate blood pressure reduction by antihypertensive medications in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), as well as rapidly treated hypertension even in those who have not yet manifested ischemic symptoms.", 
    "156": "The magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal was recorded while subjects watched a video containing separate blocks of affective and cognitive advertisements and recalled slides extracted from the video a day later. An earlier behavioural study using the same video material showed that the affective advertisements were better recalled and that administration of propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocker) abolished this effect. Magnetic field tomography (MFT) was used to extract tomographic estimates of activity millisecond by millisecond from the continuous MEG signal. Statistically significant differences between affective and cognitive blocks were identified in posterior and prefrontal areas. Cognitive blocks produced stronger activity in posterior parietal areas and superior prefrontal cortex in all three subjects. Affective blocks modulated activity in orbitofrontal and retrosplenial cortex, amygdala and brainstem. Individual contributions to the statistical maps were traced in real time from milliseconds to many seconds. Time-locked responses from the recall session were used to compare average and single trial MFT solutions and to combine activations from all subjects into a common anatomical space. The last step produced statistically significant increases in occipital and inferior ventral cortex between 100 and 200 ms compared to a prestimulus baseline.", 
    "157": "Because of the outcome of the 5 HT1B/1D agonists or \"triptans\" for the treatment of migraine attacks, it has been thought that migraine prophylaxis was not useful anymore. However, some patients are not responders to the triptans and some responders who have more than one attack a week still feel the need for prophylactic treatment. Apart from non-pharmacological treatments that are always needed, the different drugs that have shown their efficiency in clinical trials are analysed. The choice of a prophylactic treatment mostly depends on the benefits/risk ratio. In migraine prophylaxis beta-blockers have a good benefits/risk ratio, serotonin receptor antagonists that are effective as well, have a high frequency of adverse effects, especially weight gain and fatigue, which are limiting factors for prescription. In France dihydroergotamine is still largely prescribed because it is well tolerated. Second-line treatments may be considered, they have been studied through clinical trials, they are efficient, but they have severe side effects: flunarizine, sodium valproate and methysergide. The management of all these side effects has to be known, because prophylactic treatment is still necessary for the well-being of migraineurs.", 
    "158": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of solubilizing excipients on Caco-2 transport parameters of poorly water-soluble NCEs (new chemical entities), and determine their permeability class under the BCS guidance (Biopharmaceutics Classification System). The effect of solubilizing excipients on soluble donor concentration of Sch 56592, Sch-X and Sch-Y was estimated. The transport of reference compounds and NCEs was studied across Caco-2 monolayers in absence or presence of solubilizing agents. The Caco-2 permeability of reference compounds showed good correlation with their extent of human oral absorption data. Sch 56592, Sch-X and Sch-Y exhibited high baseline Caco-2 permeability (>10(-5) cm/s). Povidone (1%) improved soluble donor concentration and flux of Sch 56592 by 40%. Other solubilizing excipients predominantly improved Sch 56592 soluble donor concentration, with either no change or a decrease in flux. With Sch-X, 1% povidone, pluronic F68, gelucir 44/14, and 3:2 propylene glycol/Tween-80 markedly improved soluble donor concentration, while increasing Sch-X flux by 40-65%. The soluble donor concentration of Sch-Y was also enhanced by excipients; however, only 1% pluronic F68 and PEG 300 increased Sch-Y flux by 35-50%. Sch 56592, Sch-X and Sch-Y are low solubility-high permeability compounds under the BCS guidance. For such poorly water-soluble NCEs, solubilizing excipients should be carefully screened based on their effects on solubility profiles and membrane transport.", 
    "159": "Unilateral, focal cerebrocortical lesion (FCL) and associated spreading depression (SD) increase immediate-early gene (IEG) expression throughout the ipsilateral hemisphere. Noradrenergic transmission is involved in the regulation of basal- and stimulation-induced expression of IEGs in cerebral cortex; and is modulated by both injury and SD. The present study further investigated the association between the noradrenergic system and cortical adaptive responses, by examining basal and FCL(SD)-induced cortical IEG expression following acute treatment with alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1/2)-adrenoceptor (AR) agonists or antagonists. Activation of alpha(1)-ARs by NVI-085, or beta-ARs by salbutamol, increased cortical NGFI-A, c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels, whereas inhibition of alpha(1)-ARs by prazosin, or beta-ARs by propranolol, had no marked effect. The alpha(2)-AR agonists, clonidine and UK14304 also had no effect on basal IEG levels, while blockade of alpha(2)-ARs by methoxyidazoxan significantly increased NGFI-A and c-fos expression, but decreased c-jun mRNA levels. This latter effect confirms the complex and differential nature of IEG regulation in brain. In FCL(SD) rats, all AR agonists generally produced a supra-additive (synergistic) effect on expression of the examined IEGs, compared with drug-treatment or FCL alone. Prazosin reduced FCL(SD)-induced elevations of c-jun and c-fos, but not NGFI-A, mRNA. Methoxyidazoxan enhanced NGFI-A and c-fos mRNA expression after FCL(SD), but reduced c-jun. Propranolol enhanced all lesion-induced IEG levels. These results confirm that alpha(1)- and beta-ARs normally mediate a stimulatory, and alpha(2)-ARs a net inhibitory, influence on cortical cell activity (reflected by NGFI-A, c-fos expression); and demonstrate that alterations in noradrenergic tone modulate the level of cellular activation during and after SD, which is primarily elicited by K(+)/glutamate via NMDA receptors and Ca(2+)-associated mechanisms. In turn, noradrenergic transmission and interactions with excitatory systems are likely to be important in responses to brain injury, including regulation of IEGs and their downstream target genes.",

    "161": "In this comparative, open-label study we enrolled 29 patients who received steroid therapy after PRK and developed intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation within 30 days of treatment. Fifteen were randomized to 0.005% latanoprost (group A) and 14 to 0.50% timolol (group B). IOP measurements were scheduled at 1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of therapy. RESULTS; We did not find any real differences between latanoprost and timolol except at the 7-day and 15-day timepoints, when latanoprost reduced IOP significantly more than timolol (p=0.033, 0.035, respectively). After 7 days of therapy two of the 14 timolol-treated patients had high IOP (24 and 26 mmHg) but these promptly returned to normal when latanoprost was added. No significant differences were observed in the ocular side effects considered.", 
    "162": "0.005% latanoprost is as safe and effective as 0.50% timolol in the treatment of SIOH after PRK. Both drugs provide a significant and stable IOP reduction in the majority of patients after short-term treatment. These findings are encouraging for the use of latanoprost in the management of SIOH after PRK, although further trials are necessary to consider it as a primary treatment.",

    "164": "A total of 164 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, capsular glaucoma or ocular hypertension were included in a three-month, open-label, randomised multicentre study. Patients with open-angle glaucoma were required to have IOP at least 22 mmHg and patients with ocular hypertension were required to have IOP at least 27 mmHg, on treatment with one or two ocular hypotensive drugs of which at least one had to be a beta-blocker. All patients were treated with timolol, 5 mg/ml twice daily, for a 2-4 week run-in period. They were then randomised to latanoprost, 50 microg/ml once daily, or timolol 5 mg/ml plus dorzolamide, 20 mg/ml twice daily. The difference in mean diurnal IOP change from baseline to month 3 was compared in the two groups.",

Whether the objective is to improve outcomes (e.g., reducing mortality among patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction) or to improve a process of care (e.g., increasing the rate of beta blocker administration at discharge in patients with acute myocardial infarction), data are central to assessing the quality of health care. Data help determine where opportunities for improvement exist and document the impact that system change interventions have made on the outcomes or processes of care for a clinical condition or topic. Measuring performance is critical to learning how your practice compares with best practices. If you haven't measured, you do not know. This article will focus specifically on the role and use of data to improve processes of health care for Medicare beneficiaries. Examples of projects and results are cited from the work of the Texas Medical Foundation, which is the Medicare peer review organization under the Health Care Financing Administration's Health Care Quality Improvement Program.", 
    "172": "In hypertension both beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are drugs with proved efficacy. Because only half the patients respond to a single drug, even at full dosage, a second hypotensive agent is frequently required to obtain adequate blood pressure control. The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist and a beta-blocker can be justified by their different mechanisms of action. A randomised double blind parallel group study versus placebo was performed, in order to assess the efficacy of atenolol combined with amlodipine in the treatment of stage I-II essential hypertension not controlled by atenolol alone. Twenty-four-hour arterial blood pressure monitoring showed that amlodipine added to atenolol produced a statistically significant reduction of blood pressure values compared with placebo in patients whose blood pressure was not controlled by atenolol alone. Blood pressure circadian rhythm was unchanged. The reduction of side-effects, obtained by adding a dihydropyridine derivate to a beta-blocker, confirms the effectiveness of this combination.", 
    "173": "Activation of beta-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamus (HYP) and preoptic area (POA) inhibits both gonadotropin release and reproductive behaviour in female rats. Exposure of female rats for 48 h to physiologically relevant doses of oestrogen attenuates beta-adrenoceptor function in the HYP and POA as indicated by reduced isoproterenol (beta-adrenoceptor agonist) stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity. Reduced beta-adrenoceptor coupling to G protein in the HYP-POA from oestrogen-exposed female rats correlates with attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor function. To examine potential mechanisms underlying receptor-G protein uncoupling, initial experiments tested the hypothesis that oestrogen attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor function in the HYP and POA involves receptor phosphorylation. Activation of endogenous serine/threonine phosphatases with protamine restores agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation in HYP slices from oestrogen-exposed female rats to control levels. Additional experiments examined whether oestrogen-induced changes in beta-adrenoceptor binding density and/or subcellular localization correlate with the attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor function in the HYP and POA. Oestrogen treatment does not alter total beta-adrenoceptor binding density in the HYP or POA. However, oestrogen significantly reduces cell surface binding of the hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [3H] CGP 12177 to intact HYP and POA slices. At the same time, oestrogen decreases the fraction of beta-adrenoceptors localized in a light vesicle fraction following sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Therefore, oestrogen attenuates beta-adrenoceptor signalling in the HYP-POA by uncoupling the beta-adrenoceptor from G protein, perhaps by promoting receptor phosphorylation. Furthermore, a significant fraction of beta-adrenoceptors in the HYP and POA are no longer accessible to hydrophilic ligands, but are not internalized. Thus, physiological doses of oestrogen may facilitate reproductive behaviour and gonadotropin release, in part, by stabilizing beta-adrenoceptor phosphorylation in the HYP and POA, thereby uncoupling the receptors from G protein.", 
    "174": "Left ventricular remodeling is a frequent and unfavorable evolution of both ischemic and non-ischemic dilative cardiomyopathy with a significant reduction in left ventricular systolic and diastolic performance. By the term \"remodeling\" we refer to a variety of alterations in left ventricular morphology and volume; while patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy frequently show global and quite homogeneous enlargement of the left ventricle, transmural myocardial infarctions can be followed initially by regional expansion and only in a second stage by a global increase in ventricular size. Cardiologists have a number of therapeutic options from which to choose: ACE-inhibitors and probably angiotensin II antagonists can contrast the unfavorable progression of the phenomenon, while beta-blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol probably can reverse the process. In addition, moderate exercise training not only produces no detrimental effects on infarct size or left ventricular topography, but can prevent the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and its attendant morbidity and mortality in selected populations.", 
    "175": "Tremor is the most common initial symptom and one of the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease. Mild tremor causes only minimal disability, but severe tremor causes more significant disability and distress for the patient than rigidity and/or bradykinesia. Anticholinergic agents, levodopa/DCI and dopamine agonists are most common and beneficial in parkinsonian tremor, but efficacies of these medications are variable among patients. Rigidity and bradykinesia are more responsive to levodopa/DCI therapy than tremor. Clozapine is an atypical neuroleptic agent, not on the market in Japan, and has been reported to decrease or ameliorate parkinsonian tremor through the studies of open label and double blind crossover as a new drug for parkinsonian tremor.", 
    "176": "It is well recognized that the administration of beta blockers to patients after myocardial infarction improves survival. This retrospective cohort and prospective study sought to define the usage of a large hospitalist group and enhance this usage by education and the utilization of a uniform discharge summary. All patients with a discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction were included for analysis. The use of beta blockers by the hospitalist group was initially collected retrospectively and compared with two large cohorts. The data were presented to the hospitalist group. Prospective data collection then commenced. Retrospective analysis of the use of beta blockers showed a rate of 68% as compared with 21% and 34% in two large cohorts (P < .0001). After data were reviewed and conference occurred, prospective use of beta blockers increased to 90% (P < .0005). Patients with myocardial infarction were extremely likely to be treated with beta blockers by this hospitalist group. Review of previous usage and review of contraindications along with the use of a uniform discharge summary resulted in a significant increase in the use of these life-saving drugs.", 
    "177": "Adverse drug effects on the myocardium are often classified into toxic and hypersensitivity forms of myocarditis, each with distinct histologic findings. In contrast, giant cell myocarditis (GCM) is generally not associated with adverse drug reactions and has unique histopathologic features. We report four cases of adverse drug reactions in which the histologic findings were characteristic of GCM. The clinical recognition that GCM may be a manifestation of an adverse drug reaction is important, since the prognosis and treatment of this entity may be different from that of other forms of myocarditis.", 
    "178": "Primary granulosa cells obtained from PMSG primed immature rats were triple transfected with SV40 DNA, Ha-ras oncogene and an expression vector containing human beta(2)-adrenergic receptors resulting in granulosa cell lines constitutively expressing the beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Isoproterenol, a potent adrenergic agent, stimulated both cAMP accumulation and progesterone production in these cells in a dose dependent manner. Responsiveness of these cells was specific only to isoproterenol, while hCG (2.4 nM) and hFSH (2.4 nM) had no effect on steroid production. ED(50) for stimulation of cAMP and progesterone in these cells by isoproterenol was 2x10(-6) M and 7x10(-6) M, respectively. Forskolin also showed a dose dependent stimulation of cAMP and progesterone with ED(50) of 1.5 and 0.35 microg/ml, respectively. Epinephrine at a dose of 10(-5) M elicited maximum response to produce cAMP and progesterone. Isoproterenol induced accumulation of cAMP and progesterone in these cells were inhibited by beta(2)-adrenergic blocker, propranolol with an ED(50) of 6x10(-8) and 7x10(-9) M, respectively, whereas the beta(1)-adrenergic blocker, metoprolol was effective only at a very high concentration (ED(50)>10(-4) and 1.9x10(-5) M for inhibiting isoproterenol induced cAMP and progesterone production, respectively). Induction of steroidogenesis by isoproterenol or forskolin involved de novo synthesis of the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (SCC) enzyme complex, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence staining for adrenodoxin. Western analysis indicate that expression of adrenodoxin is upregulated by forskolin, isoproterenol and adrenalin by 7.8-, 6.9- and 10.8-fold, respectively. The presence of StAR protein was identified by Western blotting. StAR expression was elevated by 8.3-, 2.5- and 4.7-fold upon stimulation with forskolin, isoproterenol and adrenalin, respectively. Thus, this cell line could serve as a good model system to study catecholamine mediated regulation of growth and differentiation of granulosa cells and the role of oncogenes in this process.", 
    "179": "Preclinical studies suggest that augmentation of selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors by the 5-HT(1A) receptor agent pindolol might reduce the delay between initiation of treatment and antidepressant response, an effect largely mediated by blockade of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nuclei. Although some controlled clinical trials suggest that pindolol might reduce latency to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor response in acute depressive episodes, the effect is moderate and highly variable. Recent positron emission tomography studies investigating the occupancy of 5-HT(1A) receptors in humans by pindolol have shown that at the dose used most often in clinical trials the occupancy is low and variable, which might explain the inconsistent clinical results. Positron emission tomography studies also suggest that pindolol might be more potent at blocking 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors than at blocking postsynaptic receptors, a property that may be useful in this pharmacologic strategy. Thus, the positron emission tomography data support the potential of pindolol to augment the antidepressant response of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but also imply that this potential has not been fully evaluated. Here we review the clinical trials, the positron emission tomography studies, and the possible mechanisms of pindolol augmentation. It is also suggested that positron emission tomography may be used to define therapeutic dosing early on in the process of clinical evaluation of new treatment strategies.", 
    "180": "It is known that the somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A autoreceptor works to regulate the action of 5-HT neurons leading to the release of 5-HT. Our present study has addressed the possibility that (+/-)-pindolol, which is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist/somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor antagonist, might have the ability to enhance the level of extracellular 5-HT when used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; i.e., fluvoxamine). We have used freely moving rats to measure the extracellular level of 5-HT and dopamine (DA) in the raphe, dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex using an in vivo microdialysis technique. Response power of (+/-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg, i.p.) to the rise in extracellular 5-HT level when used with fluvoxamine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) was significant in the raphe, dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, while the degree of augmentation was more significant in the prefrontal cortex than in the dorsal hippocampus. The extracellular level of DA when used with (+/-)-pindolol showed a tendency to decrease in the raphe while showing a tendency to increase in the dorsal hippocampus. However, no change occurred in the prefrontal cortex. This indicates that (+/-)-pindolol has the ability to block the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, thereby weakening the fluvoxamine-induced indirect action of the autoreceptors in the raphe. We have obtained positive result for the probability of pindolol augmentation in two regions--dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This indicates that augmentation therapy by the combined use of fluvoxamine with 5-HT1A antagonist will be valid and effective.",

    "183": "During rifampin treatment, the areas under the curve of intravenous and oral talinolol were significantly lower (21% and 35%; P < .05). Treatment with rifampin resulted in a significantly increased expression of duodenal P-glycoprotein content 4.2-fold (2.9, 6.51) (Western blot) and messenger RNA was increased in six of the eight volunteers. P-Glycoprotein expression in biopsy specimens of gut mucosa correlated significantly with the systemic clearance of intravenous talinolol (rs = 0.74; P < .001).", 
    "184": "Rifampin induces P-glycoprotein-mediated excretion of talinolol predominantly in the gut wall. Moreover, clearance of talinolol from the blood into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract may be predicted by the individual intestinal P-glycoprotein expression. Thus we describe a new type of steady-state drug interaction affecting compounds that are subject to transport rather than metabolism."
