    "0": "An implicit assumption guiding many studies of neurochemical systems involved in learning and memory in animal subjects is that animal and human memory systems use the same or similar mechanisms. Because acquisition and retention performance can be influenced by many processes other than information storage, special effort is required to distinguish influences on memory processes from other factors influencing performance. This article reviews the findings of recent studies investigating the effects, on memory, of drugs affecting adrenergic, opioid peptidergic, GABAergic and cholinergic systems. The review focuses primarily on studies using posttraining treatments and tests for retention given no sooner than a day after the training. Extensive evidence suggests that such drugs interact within the amygdaloid complex and that projections from the amygdala influence memory storage in other brain regions. The assumption that comparable processes occur in animal and human subjects is supported by evidence that, in human subjects, emotionally influenced memory is blocked by a beta-adrenergic blocker and by lesions of the amygdaloid complex.", 
    "1": "The electrophysiological effects mediated by beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in spontaneously active sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers were investigated using the non-selective agonist (-)-isoproterenol (IPN) and the selective agonists (-)-noradrenaline (beta 1) and procaterol (beta 2) in the absence and presence of the selective antagonists bisoprolol (beta 1) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2). IPN (0.01 mumol/l) increased the spontaneous rate by 54% and the slope of diastolic depolarization by 68% of the respective control values. Further, IPN increased the action potential duration at -20 mV (APD -20 mV) from 96 to 154 ms, reduced the APD-70 mV by 17% and the duration of the diastole by 39% and slightly hyperpolarized the maximum diastolic potential. These effects were partially inhibited by ICI 118,551 (0.03 mumol/l), diminished by bisoprolol (0.1 mumol/l) and almost completely blocked by the combination of both antagonists. Concentration response curves of IPN were influenced by the selective antagonists as follows: ICI 118,551 (0.03 mumol/l) shifted the curves to the right by 0.2-0.4 log units and increased the slope factor. Bisoprolol (0.1 mumol/l) induced a greater shift to the right by 1.1-1.5 log units. Combination of bisoprolol with ICI 118,551 shifted the curves to the right by 1.5-1.7 log units. Noradrenaline (0.3 mumol/l) elicited similar actions as IPN. Bisoprolol (0.1 mumol/l) shifted the concentration response curves of noradrenaline to the right by 1.1-1.9 log units. Actions of procaterol (0.1 mumol/l) were weak, attained only 15-35% of the maximal effects of IPN and could be blocked by ICI 118,551 (0.03 mumol/l). These results show that the increase of pacemaker activity induced by catecholamines in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers is predominantly mediated by stimulation of beta 1-receptors. However, contribution of beta 2-receptor mediated effects could be demonstrated.", 
    "2": "The effect of dietary n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and age on inotropic responses of heart papillary muscle to alpha 1-or beta-adrenoceptor stimulation was examined in young (4 months), middle-aged (12 months) and senescent (27 months) male Wistar rats. From the age of two months the rats were fed a diet containing 2% or 12% of fat by weight varying in PUFA type: a) standard low-fat n-6 PUFA diet, b) high-fat n-6 PUFA diet or c) high-fat n-3 PUFA diet. The inotropic responses to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with phenylephrine were triphasic (positive, negative, then positive). Young, high-fat n-3 PUFA-fed rats exhibited significantly lower negative and higher positive responses to phenylephrine stimulation, and higher positive responses to isoprenaline stimulation than young, high-fat n-6 PUFA-fed rats. On the other hand, no such dietary-related difference was found between young rats fed a high-fat n-3 PUFA diet and a standard low-fat n-6 PUFA diet. The young high-fat n-6 PUFA-fed rats exhibited inotropic responses similar to those of the middle-aged and senescent rats within the three dietary groups. The time to peak force and the time of half relaxation did not differ within dietary and age groups. The findings indicate that dietary n-6 PUFA-rich supplementation at a young age induces changes resembling the effects of age, as evidenced by decreasing cardiac responses to adrenoceptor agonists, such as phenylephrine or isoprenaline.",

Scatchard analysis revealed that there are high- and low-affinity sites for (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 in WAT. The (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 bound to a high-affinity site was displaced by 1 microM propranolol. The rank of pKi values of catecholamines for the site was isoproterenol > epinephrine > norepinephrine. By contrast, BRL37344A, BRL35135A and SR59230A, beta 3-selective agonists had high affinity for the low-affinity site of (-)-[3H]-CGP12177, whereas (-)-[3H]-CGP12177 bound to a low-affinity site was completely displaced by 100 microM bupranolol but not 1 microM propranolol. The pKi values of the catecholamines (isoproterenol, norepinephrine, epinephrine) for this site were very low. In addition, the correlation between the pKi values of various beta-agonists for the low-affinity site of rat WAT and those obtained from rat cloned beta 3-ARs was significant, but those of human cloned beta 3-ARs were not. Consequently, the results suggested that the high- and low-affinity sites were beta 2-ARs and beta 3-ARs in rat WAT, respectively.", 
    "20": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptors exist, but the physiologic role of PACAP is unclear in the heart in situ. We investigated effects of PACAP-38 on sinus rate and on the negative chronotropic response to acetylcholine (ACh) or stimulation of the intracardiac parasympathetic nerve fibers to the sinoatrial nodal region in the automatically decentralized heart of the open chest, anesthetized dog. PACAP-38 (0.1-1 nmol) injected directly into the sinus node artery caused transient positive followed by negative chronotropic responses. Both pretreatment with atropine and tetrodotoxin inhibited the negative chronotropic responses to PACAP-38. However, hexamethonium did not block the negative responses to PACAP-38. After treatment with PACAP-38 (0.1-1 nmol), ACh induced atrial fibrillation significantly (p < 0.01). On the other hand, the negative chronotropic responses to intracardiac parasympathetic stimulation were not changed. These results suggest that (a) PACAP-38 induces negative chronotropic responses and liberates ACh from intracardiac postganglionic parasympathetic nerves, and that (b) PACAP-38 reduces ACh-induced atrial fibrillation threshold in the dog heart in situ.", 
    "21": "Neutrophils play a major role in the host defence by producing reactive oxygen species. These products are liberated by activated cells and are known to cause endothelial cell injury and damage. The present study shows that low-density lipoproteins increase superoxide anion production by twofold in polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe in vitro. Moreover, LDL induced a large increase in phosphoinositides and cytosolic-free calcium. Data from experiments performed on neutrophils treated with pertussis toxin, staurosporine, propranolol or niflumic acid suggest that modulation of phospholipase D and A2 activities could be involved in the modification by LDL of leukocyte response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. LDL lipid moiety could play a key role in their action on polymorphonuclear functions because cholesterol was exchanged between lipoproteins and cells that can modify membrane fluidity and interact with the formyl-Met-Leu-Phe receptor.",

Centrally administered noradrenaline (NA), amphetamine, which liberates NA and dopamine in the central nervous system and L-dopa, the precursor of dopamine significantly suppressed paw oedema. Conversely, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, catecholaminergic neuron degenerator, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol and dopamine synthesis inhibitor, alpha-methyl para tyrosine (AMPT) augmented paw oedema. In addition, 6-OHDA and haloperidol produced significant reduction in pain threshold.

Oral administration of butoxamine but not metoprolol significantly attenuated gastric mucosal damage in the three types of ulcer model. Intraperitoneal injection of butoxamine reduced indomethacin ulceration but not that of the other two models. The stimulatory effect of butoxamine on the gastric mucosal potential difference and intramucosal mucus level correlated positively with its anti-ulcer action. Only oral administration of butoxamine significantly increased the mucosal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level but not after intraperitoneal injection. Oral administration of butoxamine also significantly increased the mucosal PGE2 level in the three types of ulcer model but this drug was only effective in the indomethacin ulcer model after intraperitoneal injection. Gastric acid and pepsin output were not affected by either drug. Metoprolol significantly reduced systemic blood pressure; this could be attributed to a reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow. These results imply that beta 2-adrenoceptors play a significant role in the pathogenesis of gastric ulceration. We suggest that the anti-ulcer effect of butoxamine was in part a result of strengthening of the mucosal barrier but that this was not effected by modification of acid or pepsin secretions in the stomach. Stimulation of PGE2 in the gastric mucosa could contribute in part to the anti-ulcer action of the drug, especially when given by the oral route.",

After introduction of drug solution into the cell on the cornea, sclera (bulbar conjunctival and scleral layer) or palpebral conjunctiva, the disappearance of the drug from the cell was determined as in-situ absorption. The ophthalmic drugs disappeared from the conjunctival and scleral membranes although disappearance from the cornea was hardly observed. The conjunctival membrane showed the highest permeability. Lipophilic drugs were more permeable than hydrophilic. In-situ apparent permeability coefficients of the ophthalmic drugs through the conjunctiva and sclera correlated with the lipophilicity of drugs. A high drug concentration in the aqueous humor was observed after corneal application. There is a relationship between concentration in the aqueous humor was observed after corneal application. There is a relationship between concentrations of drugs in the aqueous humor and previously reported in-vitro apparent permeability coefficients of the drugs in the cornea. This in-situ method using a cylindrical cell is a useful method of investigating the ocular absorption of ophthalmic drugs.",

SHR were treated for 2 weeks with the alpha 1, blocker bunazosin (0.5 mg/kg body weight/day). The systolic blood pressure immediately declined with bunazosin treatment, and then rose toward the level observed in untreated SHR. This antihypertensive effect was accompanied by a decrease in the ratio of prostacyclin to thromboxane A2 in the vascular wall and the kidney. A subdepressor dose of the thromboxane synthase inhibitor OKY-046 lessened the thromboxane generation during bunazosin treatment, and synergistically potentiated the antihypertensive action of the alpha 1 blocker. Such synergy was also observed between OKY-046 and prazosin, an alternative alpha 1 blocker, but not with amosulalol, an alpha 1 blocker having no quinazoline moiety. alpha 1 blockers with a quinazoline moiety dose-dependently stimulate thromboxane generation in cultured smooth muscle cells from SHR. These data indicate that alpha 1 blockers enhance thromboxane generation in the arterial wall and kidney, thereby contributing to the lessening of the antihypertensive effects observed during alpha 1 blocker treatment.",

Six-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were immunized against clenbuterol conjugated to histone by diazotization and then received clenbuterol approximately 4 wk after the initiation of immunization. Antibody titers were determined using indirect ELISA with diazotized clenbuterol-BSA conjugate as an antigen in coating the microwells. Antibody titer increased during booster injections. No significant difference in titer value was observed between two doses of immunogen (.1 vs .5 mg). Competitive ELISA showed that terbutaline cross-reacted with anti-clenbuterol antibodies, and the cross-reactivity was 12%. Alprenolol, propranolol, phentolamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and L644,969 showed no affinity for anti-clenbuterol antibodies. The rats immunized against clenbuterol-histone conjugate had 11% lower body weight gain during the 23-d immunization period than the rats immunized against histone only. When clenbuterol was administered after the immunization, no significant difference in growth rate was observed between the rats immunized against clenbuterol-histone conjugate and rats immunized against histone only. No significant difference in muscle weight was observed between the two groups at the termination of the experiment. Results indicate that active immunization against clenbuterol before clenbuterol administration did not modify the growth-promoting effects of clenbuterol in rats.", 
    "39": "Halobacteria are halophilic representatives of the recently defined domain, the Archaea. Halobacterium salinarium belongs to this group of microorganisms and contains large amounts of bacteriorhodopsin in its membrane. Bacteriorhodopsin is a seven-transmembrane protein that consists of bacterio-opsin (BO), and the chromophore retinal, which is covalently attached to BO. We have investigated whether the expression machinery for BO can be utilized for synthesis of the human beta 2-adrenoceptor (beta 2-AR), a protein with a similar seven-transmembrane-helix topology. An expression vector for BO synthesis was modified to express beta 2-ARs under the control of BO regulatory clements in H. salinarium. Homologous recombination into the genome was verified by polymerase chain reactions. Northern blots revealed transcripts of the calculated size and significant amounts of epitope-tagged beta 2-ARs were detected in Western blots. However, binding of the beta-AR antagonist 125I-cyanopindolol revealed low levels of functional receptors, and the ligand binding properties of these receptors were altered when compared to native receptors. Expression of chimeras containing larger amino terminal portions of BO did not result in higher receptor levels. Expression of beta 2-AR in Haloferax volcanii, another member of halobacteria, was achieved with a vector carrying the ferredoxin promoter. The levels of functional receptor as determined by 125I-cyanopindolol binding were 180 fmol/mg protein. The beta-AR ligands isoprenaline and propranolol showed affinities expected for functional beta 2-ARs. Thus, functional human beta 2-ARs were expressed in halobacteria, constituting a first approach for expression of a eukaryotic protein in the domain of Archaea.",

We investigated the effects of N omega-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) on nonadrenergic and noncholinergic (NANC) relaxation evoked by electrical stimulation of vagus nerves in vivo and in vitro in cat. To that end, we measured pulmonary resistance during vagal nerve stimulation (VS) in vivo, and isometric tension of small bronchi (1-3 mm outer diameter) during electrical field stimulation (EFS) in vitro. During infusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), VS transiently decreased total pulmonary resistance in the presence of atropine and propranolol, with peak relaxation at several seconds after the VS and a gradual return to baseline within 2-3 min. L-NAME abolished the initial peak relaxation and reduced the peak amplitude, but did not affect the duration of the NANC relaxation. In small bronchi obtained from control cats, EFS evoked a biphasic NANC relaxation, comprising an initial fast component followed by a second slow component, and L-NAME (10(-5) M) selectively abolished the first component without affecting the second. Whilst in the small bronchi obtained from L-NAME pretreated cats, EFS elicited only the slow component of NANC relaxation, which was insensitive to L-NAME but sensitive to tetrodotoxin. These results indicate that nonadrenergic noncholinergic relaxation induced by vagal nerve stimulation during infusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine can be classified into two components, and that at least two neurotransmitters, including nitric oxide, are involved in the relaxation.",

Sera from 24 patients (44%) and 3 subjects (12%) were positive. An epitope analysis of 16 autoantibody-positive immunoglobulin fractions revealed that in two thirds of the cases, the antibodies were directed against the first extracellular loop of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor and in one third, against the second. The autoantibodies had a positive chronotropic effect on isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, an effect that was blocked by alpha 1-adrenergic antagonists. Since the functional characteristics of the autoantibodies showed no desensitization phenomena, they may play a role in elevating peripheral vascular resistance and promoting cardiac hypertrophy in patients with primary hypertension.", 
    "52": "We present two cases of acute nocturnal bruxism occurring as an early side effect of antipsychotic drug treatment. The development of bruxism was coupled with the appearance of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Both complications were relieved after the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol was added, suggesting the involvement of the adrenergic and serotonergic central nervous systems, besides the dopaminergic system, in the pathogenesis of bruxism. The positive response of iatrogenic bruxism to propranolol implies that propranolol also deserves a trial for the treatment of noniatrogenic nocturnal bruxism.", 
    "53": "This study compared the ventilatory threshold with the double-product break point in 104 patients with cardiovascular disease during ramp treadmill testing. The high correlation (r = 0.81) between the double-product break point and the ventilatory threshold, even in patients taking beta blockers, suggests the former method is a viable noninvasive alternative for identifying the anaerobic threshold in patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly when expired gas analysis is not appropriate or available.", 
    "54": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) injection into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) on plasma glucose was studied in freely moving male rats. The rats were implanted with chronic jugular catheters for blood sampling and with unilateral intracerebral cannulas placed just above the MPOA. Blood samples were taken immediately before and 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after NE injection. As early as 5 min after NE injection, plasma glucose levels rose rapidly, reaching a peak at 15 min poststimulus. The hyperglycemic response to NE injection into the MPOA was dose-related within the range of doses tested (10, 20, and 40 nmol). Previous administration of phentolamine (50 nmol), but not propranolol (100 nmol), into the MPOA blocked the hyperglycemic response to NE injection into the MPOA. The increase of plasma glucose induced by NE into the MPOA and the blockade of the hyperglycemic response to NE by phentolamine suggest the involvement of an alpha-adrenergic mechanism in MPOA-mediated hyperglycemia. On the basis of these and previous results, we propose that MPOA alpha-adrenergic synapses relay impulses activating the sympathetic outflow expressed by neurally mediated hyperglycemia.", 
    "55": "The authors report two patients without coronary artery disease who experienced asystole during the IV infusion of dipyridamole on routine TI-201 myocardial perfusion imaging and review the literature for possible explanations of this rare side effect. Until now, this side effect was only reported in patients with coronary artery disease or beta-blocker therapy. Yet, the cases lacked both concomitant factors and autonomic dysregulation is suggested as a cause for asystole.", 
    "56": "1. N-type voltage-gated calcium channels are known to play an important role in transmitter release from autonomic neurones, and recent studies have demonstrated that non-N-type calcium channels are also involved. The calcium channels coupled to transmitter release from sympathetic neurones in the mouse isolated vas deferens were investigated in the present study. 2. Contractions of the mouse vas deferens were evoked by electrical stimulation at 1-50 Hz. The contractions were entirely nerve-mediated, since they were abolished by tetrodotoxin, and were used as an indirect measure of transmitter release. 3. The N-type calcium channel blocker, omega-conotoxin GVIA, inhibited contractions in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 30 nM. Contractions evoked by stimulation frequencies less than 10 Hz were abolished, and those evoked by 20 and by 50 Hz stimulation were decreased in amplitude by 51.3 +/- 13.9% and 9.3 +/- 2.6%, respectively. 4. The N-, P- and Q-type channel blocker, omega-conotoxin MVIIC, inhibited contractions in a concentration-dependent manner and caused greater maximum inhibition than omega-conotoxin GVIA, suggesting an action on P- and/or Q-type channels, in addition to N-type. 5. The P-type channel blocker, omega-agatoxin IVA, alone did not have a significant effect at concentrations up to 300 nM, but inhibited contractions in the presence of omega-conotoxin GVIA. Subsequent addition of omega-conotoxin MVIIC abolished the remaining contractions. Identical results were obtained when the three toxins were tested cumulatively on the purinergic and noradrenergic components of the contraction in the presence of (1.3 microM prazosin and following desensitization to 10 microM alpha, beta-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate (alpha, beta-NeATP), respectively. 6. The results suggest that N-, P- and Q-type channels are involved in the release of noradrenaline and ATP from sympathetic neurones in the mouse vas deferens.", 
    "57": "1. By using fura-PE3 fluorometry and receptor-coupled permeabilization by alpha-toxin, the mechanism of the bradykinin (BK)-induced contraction was determined in the rabbit saphenous vein (RSV). The receptor subtype responsible for the BK-induced contraction of RSV was determined by means of a pharmacological blocker study and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 2. In the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (1.25 mM), BK (10(-11)-3 x 10(-7) M) induced increases in both the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and force, in a concentration-dependent manner. Both the release of Ca2+ from the store site and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ contribute to an increase in [Ca2+]i induced by BK. 3. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the application of 10(-7) M BK induced transient elevations of [Ca2+]i and force, both of which thereafter declined to the levels observed before the application of BK. When extracellular Ca2+ was replenished (1.25 mM), [Ca2+]i and force increased to form a peak, followed by a sustained elevation in the presence of BK. When an RSV strip was pretreated with 10(-5) M thapsigargin for 20 min, the BK-induced transient increases in both [Ca2+]i and force were markedly inhibited. 4. These responses induced by BK were inhibited by Hoe 140 (D-Arg-[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic7, Oic8] bradykinin), a highly specific bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, in a concentration-dependent manner. In RT-PCR, B2-receptor mRNA was expressed in the smooth muscle of RSV. 5. The [Ca2+]i-force relationships, which were determined by cumulative applications of extracellular Ca2+ (0-5 mM) during 118 mM K(+)-depolarization, shifted to the upper left in the presence of BK, thus indicating that BK induced a greater force than 118 mM K(+)-depolarization for a given level of [Ca2+]i. 6. In alpha-toxin-permeabilized preparations of RSV, application of 10(-7) M BK after a steady state contraction had been induced by a mixture of 5 x 10(-7) M Ca2+, 10(-6) M GTP and 10(-6) M captopril caused an additional force development at a constant [Ca2+]i. However, treatment with 1 mM guanosine-5'-O-(beta-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) for 5 min before and during the application of BK (10(-7) M), abolished this BK-induced additional contraction. 7. These results indicated that in RSV: (1) BK elicits vasoconstriction by increasing the Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, Ca2+ release from intracellular thapsigargin-sensitive storage sites and increasing the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, (2) the BK-induced increase in Ca2+ sensitivity is mediated by G-protein, (3) the BK-induced contractions are mediated via B2-receptors and (4) the smooth muscle cells express B2-receptor mRNA.", 
    "58": "It has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance may be a pathogenetic factor common to obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), and hypertension. Furthermore, beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics have been shown to be capable of increasing insulin resistance and thus of inducing NIDDM in predisposed individuals. We used the minimal model approach (MMA) to glucose metabolism and insulin kinetics to compare peripheral insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in hypertensive and normotensive obese men. The hypertensive group consisted of 37 obese men with mild to moderate hypertension; following a drug-free period of 4 weeks, 20 of these subjects received diltiazem and 17 quinapril over the 12-week study period. The normotensive (control) group contained 17 obese men without microalbuminuria, dyslipidemia, or a family history of essential hypertension or NIDDM. Before and at the end of the 12-week study period, subjects underwent frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance (FSIGT) tests. The results were used to estimate an insulin sensitivity index (S(I)), a glucose effectiveness index (S(G)), and beta-cell sensitivity to glucose indices during first- and second-phase insulin secretion (phi1 and phi2) using the minimal models of glucose metabolism and insulin kinetics. No significant differences in S(I) or S(G) were detected between the hypertensive and control groups. Twelve weeks' treatment with diltiazem led to a slight but significant increase in phi1; however, neither diltiazem nor quinapril had significant effects on S(I) or S(G). We conclude that men with obesity and hypertension have no greater insulin resistance than those with obesity alone, suggesting that hypertension is not generally associated with any significant increase in insulin resistance. Treatment with diltiazem or quinapril does not have undesirable effects on glucose metabolism. However, treatment with diltiazem led to a significant increase in beta-cell sensitivity to glucose; this is of particular interest, given the importance of phi1 for peripheral glucose uptake.", 
    "59": "It has been found that long-term therapy with topical antiglaucoma drugs may decrease the success of glaucoma filtering surgery. In this study, various antiglaucoma drugs, including carteolol, betaxolol, levobunolol, pilocarpine, and timolol, were investigated for their proliferative effect on cultured human Tenon's fibroblast cells. It was found that the 3H-thymidine uptake of cultured fibroblast cells was inhibited by commercial antiglaucoma drugs, including carteolol of 0.1% concentration (13%), 0.01% (50%) and 0.001% (53%), betaxolol of 0.05% concentration (14%), 0.005% (42%) and 0.0005% (62%), levobunolol of 0.05% concentration (2%), 0.005% (32%) and 0.0005% (55%), and timolol of 0.025% concentration (4%), 0.0025% (47%) and 0.00025% (55%), whereas the 3H-thymidine uptake was increased by commercial pilocarpine eyedrop from 103% (0.2% of concentration), 170% (0.02% of concentration) to 171% (0.002% of concentration), when cells were treated with commercial drugs for 100 min. Meanwhile, the proliferations of cultured fibroblast cells were stimulated by simultaneously combining 0.2%, 0.02% and 0.002% concentrations of pilocarpine eyedrops with other antiglaucoma drugs, such as carteolol of 0.1% concentration (50%), 0.01% (113%) and 0.001% (138%), betaxolol of 0.05% concentration (24%), 0.005% (128%) and 0.0005% (142%), levobunolol of 0.05% concentration (32%), 0.005% (87%) and 0.0005% (119%), and timolol of 0.025% concentration (15%), 0.0025% (94%) and 0.00025% (118%). Following incubation with pure pilocarpine, the proliferation of Tenon's fibroblast cells was inhibited for 84% (0.2% concentration), 84% (0.02% concentration) and 90% (0.002% concentration). When fibroblast cells were treated with commercial pilocarpine eyedrops for 24 hours, the 3H-thymidine uptake was increased to 160% (0.02% concentration) and 172% (0.002% concentration). This result shows that the commercial pilocarpine may play a crucial role for the proliferation of cultured human Tenon's fibroblast cells.",

    "61": "High-specific activity fluorocarazolol was intravenously injected on two separate occasions within a 1-wk interval. The initial injection was without pretreatment, but before the second injection, the volunteers either inhaled salbutamol (2 x 200 micrograms aerosol) or they ingested pindolol (3 x 5 mg during a 12-hr interval). Twenty-eight PET time frames of 31 planes were acquired over a period of 60 min after each injection. Blood samples were drawn and analyzed for the presence of fluorocarazolol and radioactive metabolites.", 
    "62": "Uptake of fluorocarazolol in the target tissues was hardly affected by salbutamol but was strongly depressed by pindolol. Pulmonary and myocardial tissue-to-plasma concentration ratios of fluorocarazolol reached plateau values of 11.6 +/- 0.6 (lungs) and 18.1 +/- 1.0 (heart) at 45-50 min postinjection. These values were reduced to 2.0 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 after treatment with pindolol.", 
    "63": "These data indicate that: 1. Pulmonary and myocardial uptake of radioactivity after intravenous administration of S-1'-[18F]fluorocarazolol represents radioligand binding to beta-adrenoceptors. 2.

    "68": "Primary adipocytes were isolated from axillary brown adipose tissue from adult cynomolgus monkeys. That this tissue contained brown adipocytes was verified by morphological examination and by demonstrating the presence of uncoupling protein messenger ribonucleic acid in the isolated adipocytes. The contributions of beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenergic receptors (AR) to lipolysis and oxygen consumption of isolated brown adipocytes were determined after agonist stimulation. Dose responses were determined using isoproterenol (a nonselective beta-AR agonist), denopamine (beta 1-AR agonist), procaterol (beta 2-AR agonist), and CGP12177A (beta 1- and beta 2-AR antagonist, beta 3-AR agonist). Isoproterenol, denopamine, and procaterol stimulated lipolysis with EC50 values of 4,500, and 83 nmol/L, respectively. Intrinsic activities (relative to isoproterenol maxima) were 100%, 74%, and 59%, respectively. The presence of beta 3-ARs coupled to lipolysis was demonstrated by the activity of CGP12177A (EC50 = 1.6 mumol/L; intrinsic activity = 62%). Isoproterenol stimulated oxygen consumption of brown adipocytes by 75-100% above the basal rate, with an EC50 of 1 mumol/L. Denopamine, procaterol, and CGP12177A stimulated oxygen consumption at a concentration of 100 mumol/L. These results demonstrate that all three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes are coupled to lipolysis and oxygen consumption in brown adipocytes from cynomolgus monkeys.", 
    "69": "The purpose of our study was to investigate the inotropic response to the endogenous agonist norepinephrine mediated through alpha-1 adrenoceptors and to compare this response to that mediated through beta-adrenoceptors in failing human ventricular myocardium. We studied ex vivo the inotropic effect of norepinephrine in isometrically contracting trabecular myocardium from both ventricles of explanted hearts. By studying influence of appropriate adrenoceptor blockers, qualitative characteristics of the inotropic response and sensitivity of the inotropic response to cholinergic stimulation, it was revealed that norepinephrine evoked both alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effects in failing human ventricle myocardium. Quantitatively the inotropic responses to norepinephrine varied markedly between preparations, but the mean responses elicited through the respective adrenoceptor systems were of comparable magnitude. Concomitant stimulation of alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors by norepinephrine alone revealed a contribution of an alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated component to the final and unopposed inotropic response. Differential sensitivity of the two adrenoceptor systems to norepinephrine depending on etiology of heart failure and possibly also thyroid status was observed. It is concluded that norepinephrine evokes an alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effect comparable to that evoked through the beta adrenoceptors in failing human ventricular myocardium, and that this alpha-1 adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effect may be of functional importance.", 
    "70": "Rat isolated right atria obtained 1 wk after sinoaortic denervation were less sensitive to the chronotropic actions of beta-agonists than were tissues obtained from animals that underwent sham surgery or no surgery at all. The potencies, but not the maximal responses for two high efficacy agonists, norepinephrine and isoproterenol, were reduced about 3- to 4-fold. Sino-aortic denervation (SAD) caused about a 3-fold decrease in potency and about a 60% decrease in maximal response for a low efficacy agonist, prenalterol. The changes in the actions of these agonists occurred in the absence of any changes in the subtype of beta receptor mediating the chronotropic response. The results of analyses of the data for prenalterol showed that SAD caused a decrease in the operational efficacy of this agonist without any changes in its KD value for beta-1 adrenoceptors. SAD had no effect on the responses of the tissue to blockade of uptake 1 and uptake 2, suggesting no compensatory changes in the removal processes caused the decreased potency. The results of radioligand binding assays showed that SAD caused a decrease in the maximal binding of 125I-cyanopindolol without altering its KD. Also, the results of competition binding assays confirmed the lack of effect of SAD on the KD for prenalterol. The SAD-induced changes in the actions of agonists acting at right atrial beta-1 receptors were caused by a down-regulation of beta-1 adrenoceptors, which probably occurred in response to SAD-induced increases in sympathetic tone.", 
    "71": "Rolipram was previously reported to elevate plasma cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and inhibit serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production in mice. CP-80,633, a new cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibitor, has been shown to augment intracellular cAMP levels and to inhibit TNFalpha release from human monocytes in vitro. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of p.o. CP-80,633 on plasma cAMP levels and lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFalpha production in mice with and without adrenal glands. CP-80,633 dose-dependently (3-32 mg/kg p.o.) elevated plasma cAMP levels and decreased systemic TNFalpha production in response to i.p. injection of lipopolysaccharide. Elevated plasma cAMP levels can be detected for up to 4 hr. CP-80,633 (10 mg/kg p.o.) caused a 6-fold increase in the plasma cAMP level, a 2-fold increase in the plasma epinephrine level and a greater than 95% reduction in TNFalpha production. Unlike CP-80,633, neither vinpocetine, dipyridamole, SKB-94,120 nor zaprinast, at 100 mg/kg p.o., modified the cAMP response, which suggests that this response is mediated by inhibition of PDE4. Adrenalectomy reduced the cAMP response and completely blocked the epinephrine response; however, the levels of plasma cAMP in the CP-80,633-treated mice (10 mg/kg p.o.) remained elevated (vehicle: 47.3 +/- 6.8 vs. CP-80,633: 98.4 +/- 10.3 pmol/ml, n = 7, P < .05). This effect is mimicked by treatment of control mice with propranolol, which demonstrates that beta adrenoreceptors contribute to the cAMP response. Removal of adrenal glands significantly increased the LPS-induced elevation of serum TNFalpha. The ability of CP-80,633 to block the TNFalpha response was only slightly affected by adrenalectomy (ED50 = 1.2 mg/kg in controls vs. 3.9 mg/kg in adrenalectomized mice). Taken together, these results show that CP-80,633, when given p.o. to mice, is capable of elevating plasma cAMP and inhibiting TNFalpha production and that adrenal catecholamines contribute significantly to the effect of CP-80,633 on the cAMP response but only slightly to its effect on the systemic TNFalpha response.", 
    "72": "The direct effects of glucocorticoids on pancreatic beta cell function were studied with normal mouse islets. Dexamethasone inhibited insulin secretion from cultured islets in a concentration-dependent manner: maximum of approximately 75% at 250 nM and IC50 at approximately 20 nM dexamethasone. This inhibition was of slow onset (0, 20, and 40% after 1, 2, and 3 h) and only slowly reversible. It was prevented by a blocker of nuclear glucocorticoid receptors, by pertussis toxin, by a phorbol ester, and by dibutyryl cAMP, but was unaffected by an increase in the fuel content of the culture medium. Dexamethasone treatment did not affect islet cAMP levels but slightly reduced inositol phosphate formation. After 18 h of culture with or without 1 microM dexamethasone, the islets were perifused and stimulated by a rise in the glucose concentration from 3 to 15 mM. Both phases of insulin secretion were similarly decreased in dexamethasone-treated islets as compared with control islets. This inhibition could not be ascribed to a lowering of insulin stores (higher in dexamethasone-treated islets), to an alteration of glucose metabolism (glucose oxidation and NAD(P)H changes were unaffected), or to a lesser rise of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in beta cells (only the frequency of the oscillations was modified). Dexamethasone also inhibited insulin secretion induced by arginine, tolbutamide, or high K+. In this case also the inhibition was observed despite a normal rise of cytoplasmic Ca2+. In conclusion, dexamethasone inhibits insulin secretion through a genomic action in beta cells that leads to a decrease in the efficacy of cytoplasmic Ca2+ on the exocytotic process.", 
    "73": "This study assessed whether treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in addition to the use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril decreases cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction (MI) and whether the presence of neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge predicts the effects of beta-blocker treatment in these patients.", 
    "74": "Both beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to have beneficial effects in patients with left ventricular dysfunction but no overt heart failure after MI. These patients often have persistent neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge, and one would expect that patients with activation of the sympathetic nervous system derive the most benefit from treatment with beta-blockers. However, beta-blockers are underutilized in this high risk group of patients, and it is unknown whether their beneficial effects are additive to those of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "75": "We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study and its neurohumoral substudy. The relations between beta-blocker use at the time of randomization and neurohumoral activation and the subsequent development of cardiovascular events were analyzed by use of Cox proportional hazards models controlling for covariates.", 
    "76": "After adjustment for baseline imbalances, beta-blocker use was associated with a significant reduction in risk of cardiovascular death (30%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12% to 44%) and development of heart failure (21%, 95% CI 3% to 36%), but the reduction in recurrent MI (11%, 95% CI 13% to 31%) was not significant. These reductions were independent of the use of captopril. Beta-blockers were not found to have a greater effect in patients with neurohumoral activation at the time of hospital discharge.", 
    "77": "The beneficial effects of beta-blocker use at the time of hospital discharge in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction after MI appear to be additive to those of captopril and other interventions known to improve prognosis.

    "79": "A major histopathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease consists of the extracellular deposition of the amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) that is proteolytically derived from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP). An alternative, nonamyloidogenic cleavage, elicited by a protease called alpha-secretase, occurs inside the A beta sequence and gives rise to APP alpha, a major secreted C-terminal-truncated form of beta APP. Here, we demonstrate that human embryonic kidney 293 (HK293) cells contain a chymotryptic-like activity that can be ascribed to the proteasome and that selective inhibitors of this enzyme reduce the phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-sensitive APP alpha secretion by these cells. Furthermore, we establish that a specific proteasome blocker, lactacystin, also induces increased secretion of A beta peptide in stably transfected HK293 cells overexpressing wild-type beta APP751. Altogether, this study represents the first identification of a proteolytic activity, namely, the proteasome, contributing likely through yet unknown intracellular relays, to the alpha-secretase pathway in human cells.", 
    "80": "Tight-seal whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells of rodent hippocampus were performed to study GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-resistant IP-SCs. IPSCs were recorded in the presence of TTX and glutamate receptor antagonists. (R)-(-)-baclofen reduced the frequency of TTX-resistant IPSCs by a presynaptic action. The inhibition by (R)-(-)-baclofen was concentration-dependent, was not mimicked by the less effective enantiomer (S)-(+)-baclofen, and was blocked by the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 55845A, suggesting a specific effect on GABAB receptors. The inhibition persisted in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+. There was no requirement for an activation of K+ conductances by (R)-(-)-baclofen, because the inhibition of TTX-resistant IPSCs persisted in Ba2+ and Cd2+. Because the time courses of TTX-resistant IPSCs were not changed by (R)-(-)-baclofen, there was no evidence for a selective inhibition of quantal release from a subgroup of GABAergic terminals. (R)-(-)-baclofen reduced the frequency of TTX-resistant IPSCs in guinea pigs and Wistar rats, whereas the inhibition was much smaller in Sprague Dawley rats. In Cd2+ and Ba2+, beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate and forskolin enhanced the frequency of TTX-resistant IPSCs. Only beta-phorbol-12, 13-dibutyrate reduced the inhibition by (R)-(-)-baclofen. We conclude that GABAB receptors inhibit TTX-resistant GABA release through a mechanism independent from the well known effects on Ca2+ or K+ channels. The inhibition of quantal GABA release can be reduced by an activator of protein kinase C.", 
    "81": "Mutations in several domains can lead to agonist-independent, constitutive activation of G protein-coupled receptors. However, the nature of the structural and molecular changes that constitutively turn on a G protein-coupled receptor remains unknown. Here we show evidence that a constitutively activated mutant of the beta2 adrenergic receptor (CAM) is characterized by structural instability and an exaggerated conformational response to ligand binding. The structural instability of CAM could be demonstrated by a 4-fold increase in the rate of denaturation of purified receptor at 37 degrees C as compared with the wild type receptor. Spectroscopic analysis of purified CAM labeled with the conformationally sensitive and cysteine-reactive fluorophore, N,N'dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine, further indicated that both agonist and antagonist elicit more profound structural changes in CAM than in the wild type protein. We propose that the mutation that confers constitutive activity to the beta2 adrenergic receptor removes some stabilizing conformational constraints, allowing CAM to more readily undergo transitions between the inactive and the active states and making the receptor more susceptible to denaturation.", 
    "82": "The rat glioma cell line C6.9 has been recently reported to respond to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) by the induction of a programmed cell death. Since, in vivo, glial cells are thought to be exposed to several neurotransmitters, we investigated the possibility of a neurotransmitter-mediated inhibition of this active cell death process. Noradrenaline and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol showed significant inhibition of the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced programmed cell death. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propanolol reversed this inhibition, while the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbin was devoid of any effect. This suggests that the efficiency of antiproliferative vitamin D-related therapies could be influenced by endogenous levels of noradrenaline.", 
    "83": "The beta blocker drug propranolol (PPL) significantly inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Mg(2+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase activities in a concentration dependent manner in rat brain synaptosomes. The concentrations required for 50% inhibition (IC50) in the activity of these enzymes were 1.5-1.8 mM. The double-reciprocal plot of ATP-stimulated Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in the presence of PPL showed apparent decrease in K(m) and Vmax and the inhibition was of an uncompetitive type with respect to ATP. The nature of inhibition by PPL of Na(+)-activated Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was of a mixed type showing an increase in Km and decrease in Vmax. Potassium activation kinetics of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase displayed uncompetitive type of inhibition with PPL since Km and Vmax were decreased. Magnesium activation of Mg(2+)-ATPase showed decrease in Vmax with no apparent change in Km in the presence of PPL. The drug inhibited synaptosomal Ca(2+)-ATPase in an uncompetitive manner. The observed inhibition of synaptosomal ATPases indicates possible alterations in the synaptic transmission by the beta blocker drug PPL.",

    "85": "This study examined the effect of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the induction of MHC class I-related genes in functionally mature brain neurons derived from cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal tissue. Patch clamp electrophysiology combined with single cell RT-PCR demonstrated that approximately 50% of the untreated neurons contained mRNA for MHC class I heavy chains, while, with few exceptions, the cells failed to transcribe beta2-microglobulin and TAP1/TAP2 gene transcripts. No constitutive expression of MHC class I protein was detectable by confocal laser microscopy on the surface of neurons. All neurons transcribed the alpha-chain of the interferon-type II receptor (binding IFN-gamma) along with the p55 receptor for TNF-alpha. Sustained exposure to IFN-gamma resulted in transcription of beta2-microglobulin and TAP1/TAP2 genes and MHC class I surface expression in a minor part of the neurons, but did not alter their electrophysiological activities as assessed by whole cell electrophysiology. Suppression of neuronal electric activity by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin drastically increased to almost 100% IFN-gamma-mediated induction of MHC class I chains, of both TAP transporters, and of membrane expression of MHC class I protein. The effect of tetrodotoxin is at least partly reverted by the neurotransmitter glutamate. In contrast to IFN-gamma, treatment with TNF-alpha did neither upregulate TAP1/TAP2 nor beta2-microglobulin gene expression, but induced MHC class I heavy chain gene transcription in all neurons. Consequently, no MHC class I molecules were detectable on the membranes of TNF-alpha-treated neurons.", 
    "86": "The effect of beta-blockers (alprenolol, oxprenolol, atenolol, acebutolol) and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac, on modification of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) by sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was investigated in vitro. Beta-blockers and diclofenac inhibit the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in LDL modified by NaOCl. Beta-blockers, but not diclofenac, inhibit the hypochlorite-induced aggregation of LDL which was determined by photon correlation spectroscopy. The intracellular accumulation of cholesterol esters in J774 macrophages is inhibited by addition of beta-blockers, but not diclofenac, to LDL prior to the addition of NaOCl. The modification inhibiting effect of beta-blockers is inversely correlated to the binding capabilities of these substances to LDL which were assessed by laser electrophoresis. Inhibition of LDL modification in vivo by beta-blockers may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and, therefore, compensate for the cholesterol-raising effect of these drugs in human plasma.",

    "88": "Gender differences in the corrected QT interval have been noted since Bazett's initial description during the 1920s. The mechanism of this gender difference is unknown, and this study was undertaken to evaluate potential autonomic and menstrual cycle effects on the QT interval. The study population consisted of a healthy volunteer sample of 23 women and 20 men. Twelve-lead electrocardiographic determinations were made at rest and following double autonomic blockade (with atropine and propranolol) during the menstrual, follicular, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Men were studied during 3 separate visits as controls. The corrected QT interval at baseline tended to be longer in women than men (421 +/- 16 ms vs 414 +/- 15 ms: p <0.07). Following double autonomic blockade, the corrected QT interval increased to 439 +/- 11 ms: p <0.001). However, the gender difference in corrected QT interval was unchanged (443 +/- 15 ms vs 437 +/- 12 ms). At baseline, there was no significant difference in the corrected QT interval among the 3 phases of the menstrual cycle (421 +/- 10, 423 +/- 18, and 420 +/- 18 in the menstrual, follicular, and luteal phases, respectively) and the corrected QT interval was longer in women than men at each visit. Following double autonomic blockade, the corrected QT interval in women was shorter in the luteal phase (438 +/- 16 ms) versus the menstrual (446 +/- 15 ms) or the follicular phase (444 +/- 13 ms; p <0.05). However, this difference, which was not present at baseline, does not appear to be responsible for the gender difference in the QT interval at rest. In conclusion, our results confirm that the corrected QT interval tends to be longer in women than men. Differences in autonomic tone and menstrual cycle variability in the corrected QT in women at rest do not appear to be responsible for the gender differences in the QT interval. The mechanism responsible for the longer QT interval in women remains to be defined.", 
    "89": "To study the rate and regulation of alveolar fluid clearance in acute pneumonia, we created a model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in rats. To measure alveolar liquid and protein clearance, we instilled into the airspaces a 5% bovine albumin solution with 1.5 microCi of 125I-human albumin, 24 h after intratracheal instillation of bacteria. The concentration of unlabeled and labeled protein in the distal airspaces over 1 h was used as an index of net alveolar fluid clearance. Since there was histologic evidence of alveolar epithelial injury, several methods were used to measure alveolar fluid clearance, including the use of experiments in rats with blood flow and the use of experiments in rats without blood flow, so that movement across the epithelial barrier would be minimized in the latter group. The results with each method were identical. We found that P. aeruginosa pneumonia increased alveolar liquid clearance over 1 h by 48% in studies with blood flow, and by 43% in rats without blood flow, compared with respective controls (P < 0.05). In both studies, this increase was inhibited with amiloride. However, propranolol had no inhibitory effect, thus ruling out a catecholamine-dependent mechanism to explain the increase in alveolar fluid clearance. An antitumor necrosis factor-alpha neutralizing antibody, instilled into the lung 5 min before bacteria, prevented the increase in alveolar liquid clearance in rats with pneumonia (P < 0.05). Also, TNFalpha (5 microg) instilled in normal rats increased alveolar liquid clearance by 43% over 1 h compared with control rats (P < 0.05). In normal rats instilled with TNFalpha, propranolol had no inhibitory effect. In conclusion, gram-negative pneumonia markedly upregulates net alveolar epithelial fluid clearance, in part by a TNFalpha-dependent mechanism. This finding provides a novel mechanism for the upregulation of alveolar epithelial sodium and fluid transport from the distal airspaces of the lung.", 
    "90": "A new non-linear method of assessing cardiac autonomic function was examined in a pharmacological experiment in ten healthy volunteers. The R-R interval data obtained under a control condition and in autonomic blockade by atropine and by propranolol were analyzed by each of the new methods employing Lorenz plot, spectral analysis and the coefficient of variation. With our method we derived two measures, the cardiac vagal index and the cardiac sympathetic index, which indicate vagal and sympathetic function separately. These two indices were found to be more reliable than those obtained by the other two methods. We anticipate that the non-invasive assessment of short-term cardiac autonomic function will come to be performed more reliably and conveniently by this method.", 
    "91": "Automated echocardiographic measures of left ventricular (LV) cavity area are closely correlated with changes in volume and can be coupled with LV pressure (PLV) to construct pressure-area loops in real time. The objective was to rapidly estimate LV contractility from end-systolic relationships of cavity area (as a surrogate for LV volume) and central arterial pressure (Pa) (as a surrogate for PLV) in a canine model using automated algorithms. In eight anesthetized mongrel dogs, we simultaneously measured PLV, LV area, and Pa (fluid-filled catheter). End-systolic pressure-area relationships in terms of pressure-area elastance (E'es)] from pressure-area loops during inferior vena caval occlusions were determined during basal conditions (control), dobutamine infusion (5-10 micrograms.mg-1.min-1), and after bolus propranolol (2 mg/kg) with both PLV and Pa by semiautomated and automated iterative regression methods. E'es increased during dobutamine infusion and decreased after propranolol infusion in all animals and with all iterative methods. Estimates of Ees from Pa were closely correlated with E'es from PLV by both the semiautomated and automated methods (r = 0.93; P < 0.01). The relationship between E'es obtained from Pn for the two methods was also closely correlated. Although the automated methods displayed larger differences from the semiautomated iterative technique by Bland-Altman analysis, the change in E'es with all techniques during dobutamine infusion and after propranolol infusion was of similar magnitude and direction among the three techniques. Greater variability with the dobutamine runs was partially due to abnormally conducted ventricular beats that minimized the number of consecutive beats that could be used for these analyses. We conclude that on-line Pa recordings from fluid-filled catheters can be used with echocardiographic automated border detection to rapidly calculate E'es as a means to estimate LV contractility.",

Patients were almost 3 times more likely to receive a new prescription for a calcium channel blocker than for a new beta-blocker after their AMIs. Advanced age and calcium channel blocker use predicted underuse of beta-blockers. Controlling for other predictors of survival, the mortality rate among beta-blocker recipients was 43% less than that for nonrecipients (RR=0.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.47-0.69). Effects on mortality were substantial in all age strata (65-74 years, 75-84 years, and > or = 85 years) and consistent with the results for elderly subgroups of 2 large RCTs. beta-Blocker recipients were rehospitalized 22% less often than nonrecipients (RR=0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90). Use of a calcium channel blocker instead of a beta-blocker was associated with a doubled risk of death (RR= 1.98; 95% CI, 1.44-2.72), not because calcium channel blockers had a demonstrable adverse effect, but because they were substitutes for beta-blockers.",

    "99": "Treatment of suspensions of guinea pig peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with four species of phosphatidate (PA) containing short-chain fatty acids induced sustained superoxide anion (O2-) production after a lag time. The rank order of efficiency of these PAs in triggering O2- production was PA8:0 [1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (GP)] > PA10:0 (1,2-didecanoyl-GP) > PA6:0 (1,2-dicaproyl-GP) > > PA12:0 (1,2-dilauroyl-GP). The O2- release from PMN stimulated with PA10:0 or PA12:0, but not with PA6:0 or PA8:0, was lowered by the addition of 1 mM extracellular Ca2+. Studies with various inhibitors showed that the mechanism of multiphasic O2- production induced by PA8:0 depended on its concentration: 1 and 3 microM PA8:0 induced O2- production constantly after a lag time through a protein kinase-dependent mechanism that was inhibited by 100 nM staurosporine. With concentrations of PA of 10 microM or more, an additional mechanism that was independent of protein kinase became operative and predominant over the protein kinase-dependent one. This protein kinase-independent mechanism was inhibited selectively by 80 microM TMB-8. Concentrations of 30, 60 and 100 microM PA first elicited transient O2- production via another protein kinase-dependent mechanism that was more sensitive to H-7 than to staurosporine, and then sustained O2- production, mainly driven by the protein kinase-independent mechanism. Metabolism of exogenously added [14C]PA8:0 in intact PMN was examined in the presence and absence of propranolol. Results suggest that PA itself is more important rather than its degradation products such as diacylglycerol, in inducing O2- production via three different mechanisms described above.",

In addition, fibrinogen binding and P-selectin expression were measured in response to ex vivo stimulation with the agonists ADP and thrombin. The three drugs had very different effects on platelets. GTN inhibited platelet fibrinogen binding and expression of P-selectin at rest and in response to agonist stimulation, whereas amlodipine enhanced P-selectin expression and atenolol increased fibrinogen binding in response to agonists. Atenolol did not block the stimulatory effects of epinephrine on ADP-induced platelet activation.

    "103": "Transgenic overexpression (40- to 100-fold) of the wild-type human beta2-adrenergic receptor in the hearts of mice leads to a marked increase in cardiac contractility, which is apparently due to the low level of spontaneous (i.e., agonist-independent) activity inherent in the receptor. Here we report that transgenic mice expressing a mutated constitutively active form of the receptor (CAM) show no such phenotype, owing to its modest expression (3-fold above endogenous cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor levels). Surprisingly, treatment of the animals with a variety of beta-adrenergic receptor ligands leads to a 50-fold increase in CAM beta2-adrenergic receptor expression, by stabilizing the CAM beta2-adrenergic receptor protein. Receptor up-regulation leads in turn to marked increases in adenylate cyclase activity, atrial tension determined in vitro, and indices of cardiac contractility determined in vivo. These results illustrate a novel mechanism for regulating physiological responses, i.e., ligand-induced stabilization of a constitutively active but inherently unstable protein.", 
    "104": "The main objectives of this research were to confirm previous reports of an increased risk of antidepressant use subsequent to propranolol therapy, and to determine whether this higher relative risk (RR) is indicative of depressive symptoms as a side-effect of the drug's use. 'New' users of beta-blockers, other antihypertensives or diuretics in two separate years were identified from records of Saskatchewan Health. Incidence of concurrent antidepressants prescribing was determined in the year after initiating therapy with a cohort drug. Medical claims were examined to identify physician services and diagnoses associated with cohort drug and antidepressant prescriptions. Risk of concurrent antidepressant use in new propanolol users aged 20-39 years was approximately double that of new diuretic users [RR 2.2 (1.5-3.3) in 1984 and 2.0 (1.1-3.5) in 1990/91]. When cases with a diagnosis of migraine headache were excluded, the risk of concurrent propranolol/antidepressant use was age- and sex-dependent, but not consistent for the two study years. It was concluded that although the risk of concurrent antidepressant use was greater in younger propranolol users, the risk cannot be solely attributed to depressive side-effects of the drug. The purposes of this paper were to present the methods employed in linking the databases of Saskatchewan Health, describe the results of the analysis, and to highlight the methodologic problems that arose.", 
    "105": "To assess if propranolol influences orthostatic intolerance induced by prolonged bed rest (BR), a lower body negative pressure test (LBNP) and left ventricular (LV) echocardiography before and during -40mmHg of LBNP were performed with and without intravenous propranolol administration (0.04mg/kg) in 9 healthy volunteers (mean age: 21 years) before and after 20 days BR. LBNP tolerance time (LBNP-T), endpoint heart rate(HR), and percentage changes from 0 to -40mmHg LBNP in HR, LV diastolic dimension(LVDd), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance(SVR) were measured. After BR, percentage changes in CO during LBNP was not altered by propranolol (-12+/-21% vs. -24+/-24%; with and without propranolol; p>0.05) because the effect on percentage changes in HR (18+/-11% vs. 26+/-12%; p<0.05) cancelled out the effects of percentage changes in LVDd (-9+/-6% vs. -15+/-10%; p<0.05) and percentage changes in SV (-26+/-16% vs. -39+/-22%; p<0.05). In addition, propranolol decreased end-point HR (85+/-15bpm vs. 119+/-l4bpm; p<0.05) and percentage changes in SVR (25+/-32% vs. 53+/-57%; p<0.05). As a result, LBNP-T after BR was unchanged by propranolol (8.8+/-3.3min vs. 10.8+/-5.0min; p>0.05). In conclusion, propranolol failed to change orthostatic intolerance induced by BR.",

In a trial evaluating combination antithrombotic therapy in resting angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), patients were prospectively dichotomized on admission into nonprior versus recent aspirin users. Then 105 nonprior users and 144 users were randomized to treatment with aspirin plus heparin/warfarin for 12 weeks. Recurrent myocardial ischemia occurring during the 12-week follow-up period was defined as recurrent angina (with electrocardiographic changes or prompting coronary revascularization), MI, or death. Prior aspirin users had a significantly higher incidence of previous MI, prior bypass grafting, beta-blocker use, or hypertension (p </= 0.003) and were more likely to present with unstable angina as opposed to non-Q-wave MI. (p </= 0.008). The cumulative probability of recurrent ischemic endpoints for nonprior versus recent users was 10% versus 21% at 14 days (log rank p = 0.03), and 19% versus 29%, at 12 weeks (p = 0.06). Using the Cox model, adjusting for variables significantly associated with outcome, aspirin use remained a significant predictor of 14-day outcome (p = 0.04) but not of 12-week outcome (p = 0.06). In conclusion, even after adjusting for significant differences in baseline variables, aspirin users presenting with rest angina or non-Q-infarction have a worse short-term prognosis in spite of maximal medical therapy.", 
    "108": "In rats exposed to a 10 min restraint stress naloxone (0.1-10 micrograms) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) did not substantially alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress response, measured indirectly through serum corticosterone levels. Met-enkephalin (10-200 micrograms i.c.v.) dose dependently increased the stress-induced corticosterone response. The increase in corticosterone secretion elicited by met-enkephalin was markedly diminished by pretreatment with naloxone. The adrenergic alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor antagonists, prazosin and yohimbine did not significantly affect the met-enkephalin-induced increase in serum corticosterone levels in stressed rats. Conversely, propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, abolished the met-enkephalin induced corticosterone response. These results indicate that opioid receptors are not significantly involved in the HPA response to a short restrains stress. In stressed rats met-enkephalin stimulates, by a central mechanism, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical activity via opioid- and beta-adrenergic but not alpha-adrenergic receptors.",

The cold pressor test has been used for the diagnosis of cardiovascular reactivity in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Some authors have stated that the cold pressor test will identify normotensive candidates at future risk of suffering from hypertensive disease. Interestingly, not all antihypertensive drugs block the exaggerated pressor response induced by cold stress. The most beneficial compounds belong to the alpha- and beta-blocker groups. Furthermore, several neurohormones such as norepinephrine, endothelins, prostaglandins, and angiotensin II have been reported to be released during cold exposure. The neurophysiology of cold pressor test indicates that after stress a great sympathetic discharge is induced at the spinal cord and terminal endings of the sympathetic nervous system. The release of norepinephrine is the cause of arteriolar vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure.",

This was performed in excised cross-circulated canine hearts. We analyzed the exponential decay component of the postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP) following a spontaneous extrasystole. All the PESPs decayed in alternans with atrial pacing at a constant rate. We obtained the time constant (tau(e)) of the monoexponential decay component of the alternans PESP. An increment of intracoronary Ca by 1.5 mmol/l enhanced the left ventricular contractility index Emax (end-systolic maximum elastance) by 2.5 times before and after beta-blockade with propranolol. The intracoronary Ca after beta-blockade slightly but significantly increased tau(e), and hence increased RF calculated from tau(e) by RF = exp(-1/tau(e)). This was analogous to the slightly increased tau(e) and RF with Ca before beta-blockade. We speculate that the myocardial cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation level would not significantly alter the effect of intracoronarily administered Ca on myocardial Ca handling, in terms of tau(e) and RF.",

One week after ligation of proximate left anterior descend (LAD) coronary artery, [3H] DHA binding sites were markedly decreased in both infarct region and non-infarct region. After treatment of propranolol (100 micrograms/kg), the [3H] DHA binding sites were obviously increased in the infarct region, and they were further decreased in the non-infarct region. The ratio of [3H] DHA binding sites of the infarct region to non-infarct region was from 0.24 at LAD ligation to 0.87 after propranolol treatment, which was close to 0.97 of control group (sham operation). The results indicated that the propranolol acted directly on myocardial beta- adrenergic through the receptor regulation of the balance of beta-receptors between the infarct region and non-infarct region, and improvement of the myocardial consonation and contraction synergism, thereby protecting the heart affected by AMI.",

Unlike the liver, the esterase activity of the skin is high in its cytosolic fraction. Most of the lipophilic propranolol prodrugs cause stereoselective permeation across hairless mouse skin. A mechanism of stereoselective permeation of propranolol prodrug across the skin has been proposed, which indicates that the stereoselectivity in permeation is resulted from the stereoselective hydrolysis of lipophilic prodrug during permeation.", 
    "128": "The regulatory mechanisms of the cerebral blood flow have preoccupied the physiology department of Cluj since the end of the 4th decade. These studies continued over the last years. The researches progressed from the studies of regulation by blood pressure changes to the nervous regulation and to the metabolic one. This paper's subject is the renin-angiotensin and adrenalin system influence on the changes of cerebral blood flow during the general hypoxic hypoxia and cephalic ischemia. Experiments were performed in 10 dogs anaesthetised with a mixture of chloralose, urethan and morphine. Hypoxic hypoxia was obtained by breathing a mixture of 11% oxygen in nitrogen, in a closed system and cerebral ischemic hypoxia by partial compression of the carotid arteries, after the ligation of the vertebral and thyroid arteries. The arterial blood pressure and the cerebral and hypothalamic blood flow, measured with the heated thermoelement, were registered. The plasma renin activity was tested radioimmunologically before, at 1.5 min, 5, 10 and 15 min, after the beginning of hypoxia. In ischemic hypoxia the experiment was repeated after venous perfusion with propranolol (0.6 mg/kg/h). The systemic blood pressure increased in both forms of hypoxia. The cortical and hypothalamic blood flow increased with the systemic arterial blood pressure. The hypothalamic blood flow remained stable or diminished a little. Propranolol increased the cerebral blood flow during ischemic hypoxia up to 300%. The i.v. administration of angiotensin (1-5 mg/kg) increased the cortical flow, while the hypothalamic flow remained self-regulated. Plasma renin activity increased more in general hypoxic hypoxia, than in cephalic ischemic hypoxia. After propranolol the increase was higher in this hypoxia. Propranolol produced a major activation of the renin-angiotensin system and of the cortical blood flow in ischemic cephalic hypoxia, the renin-angiotensin system being located in the cerebral structure. As well high doses of angiotensin produced cerebral vasodilatation in small cerebral vessels. This effect was found in our experiments in the cortical blood flow too. Our results indicate a beneficial propranolol effect on cortical circulation in ischemic hypoxia.", 
    "129": "The effects of levobunolol hydrochlorid (Bun) on the type L calcium channel currents (ICA) and delayed rectifier potassium channel currents (IK) in isolated ventricular myocytes of guinea pig were studied by using patch clamp whole cell recording techniques. The results were showed that: 1) Bun caused a dose dependent decrease in ICA and a dose-dependent increase in IK of the ventricular myocytes. The threshold concentrations of Bun for ICA and IK were 10(-8) mol/L and 10(-7) mol/L respectively. The maximum effective concentration of Bun for bot ICA and IK was 3x10(-5) mol/L, and half-maximal concentration was 3x10(-6) mol/L; 2) IK was blocked by 2x100(-6) mol/L tetraethylammonium (TEA). A concentration of 3x10(-6) mol/L Bun showed a decreasing effect on the ICA as revealed by the current-voltage relationship curve, i.e., Bun caused an elevation of the curve;3) When ICA was blocked by 2x10(-6) mol/L Isoptin (Verapamil), at a concentration of 3x10(-6) mol/L Bun showed an increasing effect on IK and the effect could be blocked by TEA. The above-mentioned results indicated that Bun had an inhibitory effect on ICA and a fascilitatory effect on IK. The results suggested that the molecular mechanisms of antihypertensive, heart rate slowing the beta -receptor blocking effects of Bun might be due to decrease of ICA and increase of IK.", 
    "130": "Antibodies against beta(1)-adrenoceptor can be detected in serum of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which have beta-agonist-like activity, and induce a positive chronotropic effect on cardiac myocytes by its persistence at full strength. Effects of the antibodies against beta-adrenoceptor from sera of patients with DCM on myocardial cytotoxicity and cytoplasmic free Ca(2+)-concentration ([Ca2+]i) were observed in the cultured single layer SD rat ventricular cells by using the cytotoxicity assay and fluorescent Ca(2+)-indicator fura-2/AM. The positive sera of the anti-beta-adrenoceptor antibodies from patients with DCM markedly enhanced myocardial [Ca2+]i. Betaloc, a beta(1)-receptor blocker, might inhibit the increase of the antibody-mediated myocardial [Ca2+]i, and the sera from healthy donors had no effect on myocardial [Ca2+]i. Our results suggest that the anti-beta-adrenoceptor antibody might increase myocardial [Ca2+]i and result in myocardial damage. The antibodies might activate receptor-gating Ca(2+)-channel, thereby causing myocardial [Ca2+]i rise and calcium overload. Early use of betaloc is recommended in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "131": "Ligands which display inverse agonism at G protein-coupled receptors do so by decreasing the intrinsic ability of a receptor to active the cellular G protein population in the absence of an agonist ligand. Expression of the murine delta opioid receptor in Rat-1 fibroblasts resulted in the inverse agonist ICI174864 being able to cause inhibition of basal high affinity GTPase activity and of the binding of [35S]GTP gamma S in membranes of a clone (D2) of these cells which expresses high levels of the receptor. These effects were blocked by co-addition of the neutral antagonist TIPP[psi], demonstrating a requirement for the delta opioid receptor, and by pertussis toxin pretreatment of the cells, showing them to be produced via a Gi-like G protein. The inverse agonist properties of ICI174864 could also be demonstrated in whole cells. Stimulation of forskolin-amplified adenylyl cyclase activity was produced by ICI174864 following [3H]adenine prelabelling of the cells. Constitutively activated mutants of receptors should provide a convenient means to detect inverse agonists. Incubation of cells either transiently or stably transfected with a constitutively activated mutant of the human beta 2-adrenoceptor with the beta 2-inverse agonists betaxolol or sotalol, which are both able to inhibit CAM beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated basal adenylyl cyclase activity, resulted in a strong upregulation of levels of the receptor. In the stable cells lines this effect was prevented by co-incubation with neutral antagonists but could not be reproduced by an adenylyl cyclase P-site ligand which also inhibited basal adenylyl cyclase levels.", 
    "132": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form a large superfamily of receptors that are characterised by a seven transmembrane helical motif. The functions they perform, such as binding ligands and G proteins, are related to the presence of certain amino acids in critical positions. We have developed a computational sequence pattern correlation technique for the recognition of such function-determining residues. The method searches for residues that are conserved in one class of proteins with a certain function but are different in other classes. The basic idea is that such residues are probably involved in this particular function. This technique was used to find residues that play a role in the binding of endogenous as well as exogenous ligands to various receptors. Many of the residues that were detected have been experimentally determined as important for ligand binding. More importantly, however, we also detected residues that are interesting targets for future mutation studies aimed at elucidating the sequence-function relationship in GPCRs. The information obtained may help improve three-dimensional GPCR models and can be useful for the study of receptor-ligand interactions.", 
    "133": "The negative inotropic effect of nearly all antiarrhythmic drugs, especially important in patients with impaired left ventricular function, represents a major drawback of medical therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the atrial and ventricular function and the exercise capacity in patients with mild heart failure treated with d,l-sotalol after electrical conversion of atrial fibrillation. The study included patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (for more than 2 weeks but less than 1 year) and mild heart failure (< or = class II NYHA). All patients had comparable basal echocardiographic findings, and received captopril. After successful cardioversion the patients were randomized in two groups: group 1 treated with sotalol (mean dose 240 mg q.d., max. 320 mg) and group 2--without sotalol. The drop-out criterion was the failure to maintain sinus rhythm. Finally, in the study remained 17 patients (10 men, 7 women, aged 41-60 years); group 1 included 10 patients and group 2-7 patients. They were assessed by quantitative echocardiography + Doppler and by standard ecg exercise test at less than 1 month but more than 2 weeks, and at 1, 3, and 6 months. When first evaluated (2 weeks-1 month), peak A wave velocity and atrial filling ratio were higher in group 2 than in group 1 (37 +/- 10 cm/s vs 20 +/- 5 cm/s and 23% +/- 7 vs 13% +/- 5, respectively) and group 1 had also a lower exercise tolerance (80 +/- 25 W vs 110 +/- 10 W). There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in left atrial and left ventricular dimensions, ejection fraction and E wave deceleration time. After 1 month there were no significant differences in Doppler characteristics, echocardiographic parameters and exercise tolerance between the two groups. Group 1 remained at a lower heart rate and had a lower maximal double product (17250 mmHg/min vs 22100 mmHg/min) corresponding to a lower cardiac work. At 3 and 6 months there were no significant changes in all characteristics between the two groups. In conclusion, sotalol seems to be a well tolerated antiarrhythmic agent in patients with mild heart failure, after conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation. In this setting: 1. Sotalol could reversibly amplify the effect of atrial stunning after electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, but this effect is brief. 2. Sotalol has no relevant negative inotropic effect, at least not in association with captopril. 3. Sotalol improves the effort capacity.", 
    "134": "A release of radio-immunoassayable LHRH from the stalk-median eminence of neonatal piglets and prepubertal gilts was measured using an in vitro incubation system. The stalk-median eminence was collected from one-week-old male (n = 19) and female (n = 21) piglets and from 6-month-old prepubertal ovariectomized gilts given oestradiol benzoate (20 micrograms/kg b.w.; n = 52) or left untreated (control; n = 25) 30 or 68 h before slaughter. Each vial, containing the stalk-median eminence in 2 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, was incubated for 30 min, followed by 30 min incubations during which either basal release or the effect of adrenoreceptor antagonists and agonists on LHRH output was evaluated. There were no differences between the basal release of LHRH (x +/- SEM; pg/ml) from the stalk-median eminence of male (65.5 +/- 9.8) and female (66.3 +/- 9.6) newborn piglets. The addition of propranolol (10(-6) M) caused a 250% increase in LHRH release from the stalk-median eminence explants of neonatal males (p = 0.08) and females (p < 0.05). Neither norepinephrine nor phentolamine affected LHRH release from the stalk-median eminence of newborn males and females. The basal release of LHRH (pg/ml) from the stalk-median eminence explants collected from ovariectomized gilts given oestradiol benzoate 30 and 68 h before slaughter or left untreated was similar (147.5 +/- 36.1, 236.4 +/- 77.7 and 202.0 +/- 41.6, respectively). Propranolol evoked a significant increase in LHRH secretion from the stalk-median eminence in the control group, but not in the groups given oestradiol benzoate. Norepinephrine (10(-6) M) increased LHRH release from the stalk-median eminence collected from the control animals, 30 h and 68 h after oestradiol benzoate treatment by 48, 78 and 73 percent, respectively. Phentolamine (10(-6) M) did not affect LHRH release from the stalk-median eminence in control animals and ovariectomized gilts primed with oestradiol benzoate. Urapidil (10(-6) M, alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist) did not affect the basal LHRH release from the stalk-median eminence of gilts from the control group and group slaughtered 30 h after oestradiol benzoate treatment, but caused a rapid increase of LHRH release from the stalk-median eminence 68 h after oestradiol benzoate treatment. Phenylephrine (10(-6) M) did not affect LHRH output from the stalk-median eminence collected at various time periods after oestradiol benzoate administration in vivo. These results suggest that in pigs, nerve terminals releasing LHRH at the stalk-median eminence level are sensitive to adrenergic stimulation or inhibition and that the adrenergic system can be modulated by estrogens in the prepubertal gilts.", 
    "135": "The present study was conducted to investigate whether +/- pindolol antagonizes ipsapirone induced biobehavioral changes in a personality dependent way. Our previous work demonstrated that high impulsives show higher immune cell responses than low impulsive subjects upon treatment with ipsapirone. A total number of 80 healthy male volunteers received placebo (N = 20) or 10 mg ipsapirone (N = 20), 30 mg +/- pindolol (N = 20), or a combination of 30 mg +/- pindolol and 10 mg ipsapirone (N = 20). Each group consisted of 10 low and 10 high impulsive subjects. Since 5-HT related drugs induce thermoregulatory responses, the study took place in a climate chamber with a constant ambient temperature. Blood samples (for measurement of CD4+ cell counts) were drawn from an indwelling catheter invisibly for the subjects. The results clearly demonstrate that the ipsapirone induced decreases in body temperature and number of peripheral CD4+ cells are more pronounced in high impulsives. +/- Pindolol antagonizes thermoregulatory and CD4+ cell responses. The results are discussed with respect to mechanisms of alteration in 5-HT function related to impulsivity."
