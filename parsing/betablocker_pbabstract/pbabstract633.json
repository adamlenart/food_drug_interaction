    "0": "Hemodynamic properties of medroxalol (MDL), a new alpha-and-beta adrenoceptor antagonistic drug, were studied in eight pentobarbital-anesthetized (open chest) dogs. MDL was injected in three doses (1.5, 3.0 and 9.0 mg/kg i.v.) at one hour intervals. A control group (n = 5) received three successive vehicle injections at the same time intervals. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, cardiac output and stroke volume (using an intrathoracic flowmeter), and peripheral resistance were recorded 45 min before the first injection and 15 min after each administration. Isoproterenol (ISP) and neosynephrine (NSP) dose-response curves were recorded before the first dose and after each injection in both group. Log-linear regression analyses were used to estimate the ISP chronotropic dose 25 (DC 25) and the ISP barotropic dose 30 (DB 30). The results show that medroxalol possesses beta-adrenoreceptor antagonistic properties which are 35 times greater than its alpha-antagonistic properties. Beta-blockade was evidenced by bradycardia and increase in DC 25, beginning at the first dose used. Alpha-blockade was not significant at that first dose and therefore cannot alone explain the strong hypotension observed. All these effects were related to the plasma-concentration of MDL.", 
    "1": "Anxiety is a common problem and often its treatment is inappropriate. Many classes of drugs have been used and benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment. Although drugs in this group are almost equivalent in their anxiolytic and hypnotic effects there are differences between their pharmacological characteristics and dosage schedules.", 
    "2": "Although the mechanism of antihypertensive action of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs (beta-blockers) is not known, a theoretical advantage of cardioselective beta-blockers over nonselective ones has been proposed in the treatment of hypertension. To study this hypothesis, we examined cardiovascular responses to handling stress in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats after a single (100 mg/kg) and multiple oral treatments (100 mg/kg per day for 17 d) with either atenolol or propranolol. Atenolol and propranolol markedly suppressed the tachycardia induced by handling stress after acute and chronic administration. Resting mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced by acute and chronic atenolol treatment, but not by propranolol. Stress-induced increase in MAP was significantly reduced by chronic treatment with propranolol, whereas no consistent effects were observed with atenolol. Acute treatment with guanethidine (30 mg/kg) markedly reduced the rise in MAP induced by stress. These results suggest that suppression of cardiac function by beta-blockers does not always attenuate the rise in MAP induced by stress, thus cardioselective beta-blockers might not confer any further reduction of the blood pressure increase due to sympatho-adrenal excitation. Inhibition of stress-induced MAP rise by propranolol could be mediated by a modulation of the catecholamine release.", 
    "3": "The development and mechanism of acute tolerance to hypotension produced by pindolol in conscious SHR were examined. At a daily dose of 3 mg/kg, i.p., the hypotensive effect of pindolol (50 +/- 4 mmHg) on the first day was attenuated to 12 +/- 2 mmHg on the fourth day. The development of this acute tolerance was not reduced by combined administration with captopril or trichlormethiazide. The hypotensive effect of pindolol was not reduced by repeated administration of isoproterenol. Thus, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, fluid retention and beta-adrenoceptor subsensitivity seemed to be ruled out from the mechanism of this acute tolerance to pindolol. SHR tolerant to pindolol displayed marked hypotensive effects to prazosin, clonidine, hydralazine, nifedipine and captopril, which were similar to those in saline-treated SHR. However, the depressor response to isoproterenol was markedly reduced in SHR tolerant to pindolol. The correlation between the hypotensive responses to isoproterenol (X) and pindolol (Y) in these SHR could be expressed by: Y = 1.00 X + 0.56, gamma = 0.837 (P less than 0.001). Therefore, acute tolerance to pindolol seemed to be mainly due to \"autoblockade\" by the remaining pindolol in the body.", 
    "4": "Pharmacological characteristics of the post-junctional adrenoceptors in the muscularis mucosae of the guinea-pig esophagus were examined in vitro. In the presence of propranolol (3 microM), all catecholamines, phenylephrine and methoxamine produced a weak contraction of the isolated muscularis mucosae. The order of potency of the contractile response was adrenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than methoxamine greater than phenylephrine and much weaker isoproterenol, dopamine and clonidine. The contractile responses to noradrenaline (10 microM) and adrenaline (10 microM) were markedly inhibited by phentolamine (3 microM), prazosin (3 microM), indomethacin (1 microM), aspirin (100 microM) and polyphloretin (30 microM), and slightly by yohimbine (3 microM). On the other hand, all catecholamines and terbutaline produced relaxation of the isolated muscularis mucosae which was maximally contracted with carbachol (3 microM) in the presence of phentolamine (10 microM), in a concentration-dependent manner. The order of potency of the inhibitory response was isoproterenol greater than noradrenaline greater than adrenaline and much weaker terbutaline and dopamine. The inhibitory responses to catecholamines were competitively antagonized by three beta blockers, being in the following order of potency as estimated by their pA2 values: propranolol greater than atenolol much greater than butoxamine. The pretreatment of the tissue with indomethacin (1 microM) did not modify the inhibitory responses to catecholamines. These results suggest that the guinea-pig esophageal muscularis mucosae has excitatory alpha 1 adrenoceptors and inhibitory beta 1 adrenoceptors, and the alpha 1, but not beta 1, adrenoceptors may link with the endogenous arachidonic acid cascade.", 
    "5": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist of propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol and butoxamine in anaesthetized cats has been measured and compared with the activity of four synthetic phenylethanolamine derivatives. The effects of isoprenaline on four parameters in the anaesthetized cat: heart rate, blood pressure, soleus muscle contractility and airway reactance, were measured and the modification of the isoprenaline dose-response relation by each of the antagonist drugs assessed. Parallel shifts in log dose-response curves for isoprenaline were caused by propranolol for all parameters, by metoprolol and atenolol for each parameter except blood pressure, and butoxamine for each except soleus muscle and heart rate. Selectivity of action of the antagonists between different organs was measured by comparing DR10 values, computed from isoprenaline dose-ratios. Propranolol was the most potent antagonist and showed slight selectivity of action on soleus muscle compared with heart. Atenolol and metoprolol were approximately equipotent and were cardioselective at low doses only. Butoxamine was the least potent antagonist and possessed non-beta-adrenoceptor effects on the parameters measured. Each of the new compounds, 4'-bromo-2'-methoxy-N-isopropyl phenylethanolamine, the 4'-chloro- and 4'-methyl analogues, and 4'-methoxy-N-t-butyl phenylethanolamine, was a potent antagonist but did not exhibit any selectivity of action. The results suggest no clear separation of beta-adrenoceptors into beta 1- and beta 2-subclasses in organs of the cat. There is no apparent separation of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects on skeletal muscle and airways.", 
    "6": "The beta-adrenergic stimulation of cardiac contraction and relaxation is related to an augmented Ca++ oscillation mediated by cAMP. This Ca++ mobilization may secondarily involve calmodulin in a way modulating the mechanical responses. We tested this possibility by studying interferences of trifluoperazine (which is able to block Ca++-calmodulin) with beta-adrenergic responses in rat heart papillary muscles. Trifluoperazine up to 10(-5) mol/l did not change the basal function. 10(-5) mol/l trifluoperazine augmented the contractile response to isoprenaline above 10(-7) mol/l. The inotropic effects of isoprenaline below 10(-7) mol/l and of the partial beta-agonist prenalterol were not influenced by trifluoperazine. 10(-5) mol/l trifluoperazine attenuated the stimulation of initial relaxation by isoprenaline in the entire concentration range. Thus this beta-adrenergic response was more sensitive to trifluoperazine than the contractile response. But trifluoperazine only slightly and non-significantly attenuated the stimulation of initial relaxation by prenalterol. From experiments on broken cell preparations the present results can be explained in terms of calmodulin blockade and thus inhibition of Ca++ efflux across the sarcolemma and of Ca++ uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Trifluoperazine effects unrelated to calmodulin can hardly account for the results. Thus a full beta-agonist can apparently mobilize enough Ca++ to activate calmodulin systems important for the final effects on the contraction-relaxation cycle.", 
    "7": "The effects of four beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents on arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation and thromboxane (TX) formation in human and rabbit platelet-rich plasma (PRP) as well as their influence on prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue (U-46619)-induced aggregation in human PRP were studied. The potency against AA-induced aggregation decreased in the following sequence: pindolol greater than propranolol greater than talinolol greater than practolol (without effect). Pindolol (0.1-1.0 mmol/l) inhibited both AA-induced aggregation and TX formation. The cyclooxygenase activity in ram seminal vesicle microsomes was suppressed by both pindolol isomers. Propranolol was without effect on the cyclooxygenase. This supports the assumption that the inhibitory activity of pindolol on AA-induced platelet aggregation is mediated by its inhibiting effect on platelet cyclooxygenase as the first step of the TX formation. Propranolol (IC50:0.2 mmol/l), talinolol (IC50:0.7 mmol/l) and pindolol (IC50:1.3 mmol/l) inhibited the U-46619-induced aggregation, whereas practolol remained without effect. The spectrum of the reported data with propranolol, talinolol and practolol may be assumed to allow the correlation of the results to both the membrane stabilizing effects and to lipophilicity of the drugs.", 
    "8": "There are few studies of hypertension in Sudan. In this report, 124 patients attending a newly established hypertension clinic are studied, most of whom were taking irregular treatment initially. Seventy-three (59%) had a strong family history of hypertension. There was a very low incidence of cigarette smoking (13.7%), and alcohol consumption (4.8%). As with blacks in the U.K. and the U.S.A., the commonest complications were cerebrovascular accidents and congestive cardiac failure. Most of the patients had moderately elevated blood pressures on the first visit, which fell significantly after 3 and 6 months of clinic attendance. Methyldopa and thiazides were the commonest drugs used, but a small pilot survey demonstrated that beta-blockers were effective. The high cost and poor availability of drugs contribute to poor compliance in these patients.", 
    "9": "The effect of varying renal artery pressure between 160 and 40 mm Hg on renal blood flow and renin release was studied in seven conscious foxhounds under beta-adrenergic blockade receiving a normal sodium diet (4.1 mmol/kg/day). Pressure was either increased by bilateral common carotid occlusion or reduced in steps and maintained constant by a control-system using an inflatable renal artery cuff. Carotid occlusion itself had no influence on renal blood flow and renin release when renal artery pressure was kept constant and the beta-receptors in the kidney were blocked. Between 160 mm Hg and resting pressure there was no change in renal blood flow; between resting blood pressure and the lower limit of autoregulation (average 63.9 mm Hg) renal blood flow increased slightly (average 7%) indicating a high efficiency of renal blood flow autoregulation. The relationship between renal artery pressure and renin release could be approximated by two linear sections: a low sensitivity to a pressure change (average slope: -0.69 +/- 0.26 ng AI/min/mm Hg) was found above a threshold pressure (average: 89.8 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) and a high sensitivity to a pressure change (average slope: -64.4 +/- 20.8 ng AI/min/mm Hg) was observed between threshold pressure and 60 mm Hg. There was no further increase of renin release between 60 and 40 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Clinical investigation of 31 patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortal stenosis (IHSS) and idiopathic hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy (IHNCMP) comprised electro- and phonocardiography, roentgenologic examination and echocardiography. The disease was latent in 3 patients, and ischemic heart disease or rheumatic heart lesion had been diagnosed prior to echocardiography in 26. Asymmetrical hypertrophy and hypokinesia of the upper third of the ventricular septum, narrowed left-ventricular cavity and septum-wise systolic movement of the anterior mitral cusp were findings common to all IHSS patients. The ventricular septum/left-ventricular posterior wall thickness ratio was elevated (1.42 +/- 0.06). In IHNCMP patients, this ratio was within normal range. The results of an acute pharmacologic test with 10 mg intravenous obsidan given to 10 IHSS patients suggested that the obstruction of left-ventricular outflow pathway was somewhat reduced. Prolonged (2 months to 3 years) obsidan treatment was given to 25 patients and was associated with positive effect in terms of improved subjective manifestations of the disease. However, echocardiographic patterns only showed moderate improvement in 9 of the 13 patients who had completed 1-3 years' treatment course.", 
    "11": "A comparative assessment of antianginal effect of inderal and anaprilin in individually selected doses was made using bicycle ergometric tests, after a single administration of the drug or during a treatment course. Mean effective single doses of inderal and anaprilin were 66 and 78 mg, and daily doses, 252 and 308 mg, respectively, with no significant differences observed between the two drugs in terms of manifestation and duration of antianginal effect. The manifestation of antianginal effect of propranolol did not vary significantly in conditions of a single administration and a treatment course. Post-treatment exercise-related decrease in double product was much more sustained as compared to the antianginal effect duration, and therefore may not be used as a measure in the assessment of the duration of antianginal effect produced by beta-blockers.", 
    "12": "The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and its analog gamma-butyrolactone-gamma-carbonyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide citrate (DN-1417) on adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) levels in rat brain were investigated using a radioimmunoassay method. The time course of elevation of these nucleotides in various brain regions after administration of DN-1417 showed a peak at 5 to 15 min followed by a gradual decrease. DN-1417 (1 to 10 mg/kg i.p.) caused a dose-related increase in cyclic AMP levels in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus and brain stem; whereas significant increases in cyclic GMP were observed in the cerebellum, nucleus accumbens and brain stem. TRH (3 to 10 mg/kg i.p.) caused significant increases of cyclic AMP in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and brain stem and also caused an increase in cerebellar cyclic GMP. With one exception, DN-1417, apomorphine (Apo), methamphetamine (MAP) (all, 3 mg/kg i.p.)- and TRH (10 mg/kg i.p.)-induced increases in cyclic nucleotides were blocked by pimozide (1 mg/kg i.p., 4 hr before), a dopamine receptor blocker; the exception was a TRH-induced increase in cerebellar cyclic GMP. These increases were not blocked by propranolol (10 mg/kg i.p., 30 min before), an adrenergic beta-receptor blocker. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MT, 250 mg/kg i.p., 4 hr before), a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor, almost completely blocked DN-1417- and MAP-induced increases in cyclic nucleotides, slightly blocked TRH-effects, and had no effect on Apo-effects. These in vivo results were confirmed in an in vitro system using brain slices. The addition of DN-1417 (10(-4) M) or TRH (10(-3) M) significantly enhanced the spontaneous [3H]-dopamine and [3H]-norepinephrine release from the superfused slices of the rat nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex in vitro. The addition of DN-1417 (10(-4) M) or TRH (10(-4) M) had no effect on the activities of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase, although only a high concentration (10(-3) M) of DN-1417 inhibited the cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-hydrolytic activities in various brain region homogenates. These results suggest that DN-1417 does not produce an increase in the levels of cyclic nucleotides by direct receptor-enzyme activation, but that DN-1417 like MAP causes the increase through endogenous catecholaminergic, particularly dopaminergic activation.", 
    "13": "The antihypertensive effect and safety of hydrochlorothiazide administration as a single drug and together with medroxalol were determined in 20 patients with primary hypertension. Following two biweekly intervals on placebo and hydrochlorothiazide, medroxalol was started at 100 mg three times a day and titrated against blood pressure response up to a maximum of 300 mg three times a day. In nine patients the effect of the single and the combined drug therapy on blood pressure during isometric handgrip exercise, on plasma renin activity, and on plasma catecholamines and their deaminated metabolites was investigated. The administration of hydrochlorothiazide was associated with a significant decrease in blood pressure, but heart rate did not change. The addition of medroxalol produced a substantial decrease in blood pressure and heart rate in both the recumbent and upright positions (P less than 0.001). Due to careful titration of medroxalol, orthostatic hypotension was observed only in one patient. Neither hydrochlorothiazide alone nor the combined drug regimen prevented or diminished the rise in blood pressure with exercise. Although plasma renin activity decreased during the combined drug therapy, there was no correlation between the initial levels or the change in plasma renin activity and the extent of decrease in blood pressure. The concentration of plasma epinephrine increased during the combined drug period, whereas catecholamine metabolites increased significantly during both periods of the study. It is concluded that medroxalol combined with hydrochlorothiazide constituted a potent and safe antihypertensive therapy for the duration of the present study.", 
    "14": "In vitro studies on the new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, cetamolol (Betacor), have demonstrated that the compound is a potent antagonist of the chronotropic effects of isoproterenol on guinea pig atria. The pA2 value (8.05) of cetamolol was slightly lower than that of propranolol (8.44). The compound was shown to possess a moderate degree of cardioselectivity as indicated by a lower pA2 value for the antagonism of isoproterenol-induced relaxation of the isolated guinea pig trachea (pA2 = 7.67) compared with that derived from atrial experiments (pA2 = 8.05). Up to concentrations of 10(-4) M, cetamolol displayed negligible negative inotropic activity relative to propranolol in the electrically stimulated guinea pig left atrial preparation. When applied to isolated right atria from reserpinized rats, cetamolol had a positive chronotropic effect (approximately 75% of that displayed by practolol) which was antagonized by pretreatment with propranolol, thus indicating intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Specificity experiments in a number of isolated tissues indicated that cetamolol had very little antihistaminic, anticholinergic, alpha 1-adrenergic blocking, or calcium antagonistic properties. Biochemical receptor binding studies are in general agreement with the observations from the isolated tissue experiments.",

    "16": "The authors use data gathered from recent clinical and laboratory studies to deal with the following six questions often facing the physician caring for hypertensive patients before, during, and after surgery. Which hypertensive patient is at increased surgical risk? When must elective surgery be delayed? Should antihypertensive medication be discontinued preoperatively? What is the ideal intraoperative blood pressure? What anesthetic techniques are best suited for hypertensive patients? Which patients are at most risk of a postoperative hypertensive crisis?", 
    "17": "The localization of vasoactive intestinal peptide-immunoreactive nerves innervating bovine lymphatic vessels was studied by an immunohistochemical technique. Nerve fibers containing vasoactive intestinal peptide immunoreactivity were present in the smooth muscle layers as well as in the adventitia of all mesenteric lymphatics that were examined. The effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide on isolated lymphatic vessels in vitro was studied. Vasoactive intestinal peptide caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of bradykinin-induced contractions of lymphatic vessels. The threshold and maximum relaxations were achieved with vasoactive intestinal peptide at concentrations less than 6 X 10(-9) M and 3 X 10(-7) M, respectively. The relaxant response to vasoactive intestinal peptide was not modified by atropine, propranolol, bretylium, or tetrodotoxin. These results suggest that vasoactive intestinal peptide may be a possible inhibitory neurotransmitter that causes relaxation of lymphatic vessels.", 
    "18": "It has been demonstrated in experiments on unanesthetized rabbits that propranolol instilled into the eye conjunctival sac caused a decrease in normal intraocular pressure and reduced prostaglandin-induced ocular hypertension. Thymolol and atenolol decreased the normal ophthalmic tone but did no affect eye hypertension. Oxprenolol and talinolol did not affect the normal ophthalmic tone and did not remove the elevation of intraocular pressure induced by PGE2.", 
    "19": "The effect of the pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoblocker phentolamine and the beta-adrenoblocker inderal was studied on the disturbances of contractile function and adrenoreactivity which occurred after exposure to emotional-painful stress. The pretreatment of the animals exposed to emotional-painful stress with phentolamine prevented to a considerable degree the depression of portal vein contractility and raised adrenoreactivity of the smooth muscle that dramatically fell after emotional-painful stress to the basic level. Administration of inderal did not prevent the stress-induced disturbances. The data obtained suggest that the stress-induced injuring effect of catecholamine high concentrations is mediated via alpha-adrenoreceptors of portal vein smooth muscles.", 
    "20": "As little is known of the antihypertensive efficacy or renal haemodynamic effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in the elderly we studied two such drugs, atenolol and nadolol, in elderly hypertensive patients. Ten patients took part in a placebo-controlled double-blind study of atenolol and 10 received nadolol in a single-blind placebo-controlled study. Treatment phases lasted 12 weeks for atenolol or 10 weeks for nadolol. Blood pressure, effective renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate data obtained at the end of each treatment phase were analysed. Atenolol lowered mean arterial pressure (mean +/- s.e. mean) from 129.9 +/- 1.5 to 108.2 +/- 2.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) while it increased mean effective renal blood flow 512.5 +/- 86.6 to 646.0 +/- 116.1 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 (P less than 0.05). Nadolol reduced mean arterial pressure from 133.2 +/- 2.0 to 113.5 +/- 3 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) but reduced mean effective renal blood flow from 558.8 +/- 32.2 to 446.0 +/- 26.9 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 (P less than 0.05). Glomerular filtration did not alter significantly with either drug. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are effective antihypertensive agents in the elderly but have disparate effects on effective renal blood flow perhaps because of differences in cardioselectivity. These data suggest that comparative studies with thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are warranted in elderly hypertensives.", 
    "21": "Progress has been made in the diagnosis and management of the idiopathic long Q-T syndrome. The association of typical repolarization abnormalities and syncope during stress is characteristic of this syndrome. The pathogenetic mechanism has been largely, although not completely, elucidated. The data available support the hypothesis of a congenital imbalance between right and left-sided cardiac sympathetic innervation with left dominance; sudden sympathetic neural discharges trigger the malignant arrhythmias. Although mortality in untreated patients is extremely high, either beta-adrenergic blocking agents or a high thoracic left sympathectomy provide protection. Because many questions remain unanswered, a world-wide prospective registry has been initiated to provide the necessary information on the management of these patients. The registry constitutes a long-term (25 years) follow-up program and includes over 200 patients affected by the long Q-T syndrome.", 
    "22": "Labetalol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with ancillary alpha-adrenoceptor blocking and vasodilating activity, will soon be available in the United States for the treatment of hypertension. Labetalol is effective in the acute management of hypertensive emergencies, as well as the long-term treatment of mild and moderate hypertension. In combination with a diuretic agent, labetalol is also effective in controlling moderate and severe hypertension. Efficacy for other indications is under investigation. Labetalol is generally well tolerated. Side effects typical of beta-blockers are less prominent with labetalol in the usual antihypertensive doses of 100 mg to 1200 mg twice daily. However, occasional mild vasodilating, alpha-blocking, and other nonspecific effects are best managed with careful dose titration.", 
    "23": "Intrinsic heart rate was measured in 19 dogs in 76 experiments after autonomic blockade, using various forms of anesthesia. Measurements were made in conscious dogs (n = 16) and in dogs in neuroleptanesthesia (n = 54) or under pentobarbital sodium (n = 6). Temperature, arterial pH, and blood gases were kept within narrow limits. Adrenergic blockade was achieved by phenoxybenzamine (2 mg X kg-1) and propranolol (2 mg X kg-1, followed by 2 mg X kg-1 X h-1). The parasympathetic system was blocked either by atropine (0.5 mg X kg-1, followed by 0.5 mg X kg-1 X h-1) and hexamethonium (20 mg X kg-1, followed by 10 mg X kg-1 X h-1) or by atropine and bilateral cervical vagotomy. Administration of hexamethonium or vagotomy was needed to block the vagal cardioacceleration unmasked by the administration of muscarinic blocking agents in conscious dogs and in dogs in neuroleptanesthesia. The mean denervated heart rate was 142.8 beats/min. This value is higher than that reported for surgically denervated hearts, the difference very likely reflecting the activity of the intact parasympathetic intrinsic cardiac innervation in surgical preparations. The estimated intraindividual and interindividual SD were 9.7 and 19.4 beats/min, respectively. The highly significant interindividual variation (P less than 0.01) contradicts the concept of an intrinsic heart rate as a practically constant species-dependent quantity.", 
    "24": "A study was made of the transfer across an in vitro perfused human placenta of four beta-mimetics commonly used in obstetric practice. Between 2% and 3% of fenoterol, ritodrine, and salbutamol appeared on the fetal side after bolus injection into the maternal circulation. For hexoprenaline, the transfer (1%) was significantly lower than that observed with other beta-mimetics studied. With constant infusion of fenoterol into the maternal circulation and recycling of a small volume of perfusate on the fetal side, a fairly rapid rise in the concentration was seen. Some sulfate conjugation of fenoterol during its diffusion from the maternal to the fetal side of the placenta could be seen. In the in vitro perfused human placental lobule there is no apparent effect of synthetic beta-mimetics on the transfer of antipyrine or glucose and no stimulation of the production of lactate and pyruvate.", 
    "25": "The effects of a novel compound, BRL 26830A, on energy balance in normal and obese mice have been investigated. BRL 26830A reduced body weight or weight gain in genetically (ob/ob), goldthioglucose, and cafeteria diet obese mice and genetically obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats. Weight reduction was due to reduced body lipid content. BRL 26830A caused little or no reduction in food intake in these animals but it increased metabolic rate and in genetically obese mice this thermic effect was increased by repeat dosing. BRL 26830A did not reduce body weight gain in the lean counterparts of the genetically obese animals. Its thermic effect was smaller in the lean than the genetically obese mice and it caused an increase in food intake in the lean mice. The thermic effect of BRL 26830A was inhibited by dl- but not d-propranolol. BRL 26830A largely overcame the depression in metabolic rate caused by fasting.", 
    "26": "This report is a review of greater than 18 years of experience with clinical trials that have examined the effect of beta blockers on mortality after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Despite inadequate sample size, a substantial number of the early randomized trials demonstrated a trend toward reduction in mortality after MI using a number of beta blockers. This review highlights the larger prospective randomized trials, especially the Multicenter International Trial of practolol, the Norwegian Multicenter Study of timolol and the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) of propranolol. The combined strength of these long-term trials, comprising greater than 8,000 patients, demonstrates a consistent and statistically significant reduction in mortality after MI. Both the Norwegian timolol study and BHAT further document a substantial reduction in mortality in patients stratified according to risk groups, with a reduction in mortality after complicated or uncomplicated first MI or in patients with prior MI. These 2 studies also document a reduction in sudden death mortality in the first year after MI. Data regarding subendocardial MI is more variable, but the Norwegian timolol study documents a substantial reduction in mortality after subendocardial MI. Based on this review, we recommend treatment of all patients who can tolerate beta blockade after acute MI, beginning in the late hospitalization phase and continuing for at least 2 years.", 
    "27": "A baboon model was used to investigate the effects of atenolol, nadolol, sotalol and labetalol on renal function. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow (RBF) were measured, using radionuclides and a gamma camera, before and after 1 week's oral administration of these drugs. All the drugs caused an increase in the GFR, but this reached statistical significance only in the cases of sotalol (P less than 0,025) and labetalol (0,05 less than P less than 0,10). The RBF was not significantly changed, although it decreased in all cases.", 
    "28": "Decisions about early management of acute myocardial infarction require great care and astuteness, since the threat of sudden death is the greatest during the first few hours after onset of infarction. General measures of acute care include relief of pain and management of arrhythmia. Drug therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents or vasodilators may also be indicated. Other measures that may be considered (some of which are controversial) include hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical circulatory assistance, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, exercise testing, modification of risk factors, and coronary angiography. Intracoronary administration of streptokinase, which is still investigational, has shown marked preservation of myocardial tissue in some cases.", 
    "29": "In a double-masked, 3-month clinical study the ocular hypotensive effects of diacetyl nadolol (DAN), timolol, and nadolol were compared. When applied topically to the eyes of glaucomatous patients timolol 0.5% was found to be significantly more effective than DAN 2% in controlling IOP at 3 of 10 evaluation periods. Fewer patients, however, developed tolerance to DAN 2% than to timolol 0.5%. DAN 0.5% was also effective in lowering intraocular pressure in 3 of 8 patients tested. Nadolol 2% had no long-term ocular hypotensive effect. Two of 8 patients treated with DAN 2% developed a bilateral periorbital dermatitis and were removed from the study even though their intraocular pressures were well controlled. No other clinically significant local or systemic side effects were observed during the course of the study.", 
    "30": "The adrenergic receptor mechanism by which halothane sensitizes the myocardium to the ventricular arrhythmogenic properties of catecholamines is unknown. The new generation of selective adrenergic receptor antagonists have been used to determine which receptor blockade causes the greater increase in the dose of epinephrine needed to achieve a threshold for ventricular arrhythmias. Dogs anesthetized with 1.2 MAC halothane had an arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine (ADE) of 2.2 micrograms X kg X min-1 that significantly increased (P less than 0.01) to 27 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 after alpha 1 blockade with prazosin. beta 1 blockade with metoprolol also significantly increased the ADE to 12 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 (P less than 0.05) but was less than the effect noted after prazosin treatment (P less than 0.05). The dramatic increase in the threshold for arrhythmias noted after prazosin could not be ascribed solely to its hemodynamic properties because treatment with sodium nitroprusside did not change the ADE (2.7 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) significantly; yet nitroprusside treatment resulted in a similar drop in mean arterial pressure (59 mmHg) to that of prazosin treatment (51 mmHg) when compared with the control group. Thus postsynaptic myocardial alpha 1 adrenergic receptors mediate most of the sensitization by halothane to the ventricular arrhythmogenic effects of catecholamines, while a lesser contribution is conferred by the beta 1 adrenoceptors. These results have implications for the treatment and identification of patients particularly at risk from halothane-epinephrine interactions.", 
    "31": "There are a number of important drug interactions with amiodarone. This agent appears to have a marked effect on the kinetics of some commonly used cardiovascular drugs, such as warfarin, digoxin, quinidine, and procainamide, and has dynamic interactions with others, such as the beta blockers and some calcium antagonists. Bleeding has been reported, apparently caused by a potentiation of the anticoagulant effect of warfarin by amiodarone. Torsades de pointes has been observed when quinidine, propafenone, or mexiletine is given together with amiodarone. Furthermore, amiodarone may interact with beta-blocking agents and some of the calcium antagonists to produce symptomatic sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest, especially in a latent or overt sick sinus syndrome. During surgery, amiodarone may induce hypotension and an atropine-resistant bradycardia, possibly by interacting with anesthetic agents. A knowledge of the time of onset, extent, duration, and possible mechanisms of the interactions of amiodarone with other cardioactive drugs is still incomplete, but further studies are of great therapeutic importance.", 
    "32": "In order to determine if a rise of circulating catecholamines occurs during somatostatin (SRIF) infusion in normal man, and if this increase plays a significant metabolic role, we infused four normal subjects with SRIF (500 micrograms/h) alone or associated with either alpha-(phentolamine) or beta-(propranolol) adrenergic blocking agents. During SRIF infusion, the initial small decrease in blood glucose was followed by a rise of epinephrine from 25-46 ng/liter (range) to 117-143 ng/liter (range) (P less than 0.05) at 80 min and norepinephrine from 204 +/- 16 to 418 +/- 60 ng/liter at 90 min (P less than 0.05). Thereafter, plasma nonesterified fatty acids, blood glycerol, and ketone bodies increased significantly. Phentolamine adjunction modified neither the catecholamines rise, nor the metabolic changes. Propranolol adjunction did not modify the glucose fall and the catecholamine rise, but resulted in blunted increments of fatty acids and glycerol and in an almost complete suppression of the increase of ketone bodies. These results suggest that the enhanced lipolysis and ketogenesis observed during SRIF infusion are not only due to the SRIF-induced insulin deficiency but also in part to a beta-receptor mediated effect of catecholamines.", 
    "33": "The efficacy of MK-421 was compared with that of propranolol in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension, using a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized protocol. The two drugs reduced supine and standing blood pressures, but propranolol, unlike MK-421, reduced heart rate. Using a pulsed Doppler method, brachial artery diameter, blood velocity and blood flow were measured during the study. These indices increased after MK-421 but were not modified after propranolol. Forearm vascular resistance decreased both after MK-421 and propranolol. Thus, chronic treatment with MK-421 or propranolol in hypertension lowers blood pressure but acts differently on forearm circulation. MK-421 dilates both the brachial artery and the arterioles of the forearm while propranolol has no effect on these arterial indices.", 
    "34": "52 patients with acute neurotic anxious and psychosomatic syndromes or chronic anxious and vegetative neuroses were treated orally with the combination drug Betamed (1 tablet contain 60 mg bupranolol and 2.5 mg diazepam). The optimum daily dosage are 2 to 3 tablets; duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 12 weeks. The most responsive target symptoms are psychogenic disorders of the cardiovascular system, anxiety and insomnia, while no antidepressive effect was observed. Clinical improvement is often observed 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of treatment, and dosage reduction is possible frequently. Rarely observed side effects are minimal and mainly occur within one week after onset of treatment. Controls performed 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of treatment revealed reactivation of symptoms only in some patients with chronic anxiety and vegetative syndromes. In addition to the easy application and excellent tolerance of the combination drug emphasis is given on the minimal danger of drug dependence.", 
    "35": "Male Broad Breasted White Turkeys (BBWT) represent an experimental model of arterial hypertension characterized by high levels of circulating and tissue catecholamines. We thought interesting to evaluate the efficacy of the long term treatment with different antihypertensive drugs. 59 male BBWT were studied, divided in five groups. The first group (13 animals) was treated with placebo; the second (14 animals) with oxprenolol 4 mg/Kg/q.d.; the third (10 animals) with labetalol 25 mg/Kg/q.d.; the fourth (11 animals) with verapamil 15 mg/Kg/ q.d.; the fifth (11 animals) with captopril 8 mg/Kg/ q.d. and furosemide 2,5 mg/Kg/q.d. All drugs were given p.o, from the 8th to the 33rd week of age. Weekly or every two weeks Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR) were measured by an indirect method. In all animals BP progressively increased and HR progressively decreased with age. Only the labetalol-treated animals showed a significant reduction of BP and HR through the study period as compared with the placebo-treated animals. These results confirm the preminent role played by the high levels of circulating catecholamines in determining and maintaining the arterial hypertension.", 
    "36": "The ligand binding characteristics of beta-adrenoceptors on membranes derived from rat whole fat pads and isolated adipocytes have been compared to those present on lung membranes using the specific ligand (+/-)-[125I]cyanopindolol [(125I]CYP). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of [125I]CYP was similar in all three preparations, whilst the degree of stereospecificity displayed by the isomers of propranolol varied between lung and isolated adipocyte membranes. The rank order of potency in displacing [125I]CYP binding was isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline in lung and whole fat pads, suggesting an overall beta 2-receptor subtype, and isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than adrenaline in isolated adipocytes, suggesting a beta 1-receptor. Pharmacological characterisation of receptor subtype with selective beta-adrenoceptor agents indicated that all three preparations contained a heterogeneous receptor population (lung 80% beta 2, 20% beta 1; whole fat pad 62% beta 2, 38% beta 1; isolated adipocyte 15% beta 2, 85% beta 1). In view of the high proportion of beta 2-receptors on whole fat pad membranes, the overall amount of beta 2-receptors on isolated adipocytes may reflect contamination from other cell types. The nature of the beta 1-receptors present on fat cells is discussed in relation to the apparently atypical beta-receptor involved in mediating the functional lipolytic response.", 
    "37": "Experiments were performed to study presynaptic beta-adrenoceptor facilitation of sympathetic neurotransmitter release in the isolated perfused rat kidney and evaluate the effect of epinephrine on norepinephrine release during sympathetic nerve stimulation. The right kidney was isolated and perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution. Norepinephrine storage sites were labelled with [3H]norepinephrine. Increasing concentrations of isoproterenol and salbutamol when perfused through the kidney, caused an enhancement of the stimulus-induced release of [3H]norepinephrine at 0.5 and 2 Hz, with the maximum facilitatory effect being observed at 0.5 Hz. The effect of salbutamol on [3H]norepinephrine release was concentration-dependent and more pronounced than that of isoproterenol. While propranolol (10(-9)-10(-5)M) by itself did not cause any significant changes in the stimulus-induced release of [3H]norepinephrine, it antagonized the facilitatory action of salbutamol on [3H]norepinephrine release during periarterial nerve stimulation. When epinephrine (10(-10)-10(-7)M), was perfused through the kidney in the presence of cocaine, it caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the stimulus-induced release of [3H]norepinephrine release elicited during periarterial nerve stimulation. However, when epinephrine was perfused in the presence of cocaine, phentolamine and corticosterone it caused a slight but significant increase in the stimulus-induced release of [3H]norepinephrine; the highest concentration (10(-7)M) still caused a decrease in the [3H]norepinephrine release. These results, while providing evidence for the existence of presynaptic facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors on renal sympathetic nerves, fail to support the hypothesis that these receptors have a physiological role in the regulation of sympathetic neurotransmitter release.", 
    "38": "Left ventricular performance was evaluated at rest and during maximal upright bicycle exercise in 51 patients with chronic essential hypertension. Twenty-eight of these patients had no clinical or electrocardiographic evidence of coronary artery disease and comprise the primary study population. The remaining 23 patients had coronary artery disease and represent a comparison group. First-pass radionuclide angiocardiograms were obtained at rest and during maximal upright bicycle exercise, allowing evaluation of global left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion. At the time of the radionuclide studies, all patients were hypertensive, defined as a diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or greater and/or a systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or greater with the patient at rest and sitting. In the primary study group, the left ventricular functional response to upright bicycle exercise was normal in 26 of 28 patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction averaged (+/- standard error) 65 +/- 2 percent at rest and increased significantly to 76 +/- 2 percent with exercise (p less than 0.001). Regional wall motion was normal both at rest and during exercise in all patients. Seventeen patients had electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and 14 were receiving propranolol therapy. The left ventricular functional response also was normal in these subgroups. In contrast to the nearly uniform normal left ventricular responses noted in the patients with hypertension alone, the group with concomitant coronary artery disease had a markedly higher incidence of abnormal left ventricular reserve (19 of 23 versus two of 28, p less than 0.001) during exercise. Thus, in most patients with essential hypertension but without concomitant coronary artery disease, left ventricular reserve during exercise was normal. Hypertension, even with left ventricular hypertrophy, should not be viewed as the cause for an abnormal left ventricular response to exercise in a patient undergoing diagnostic exercise radionuclide angiocardiography.", 
    "39": "A common target organ involvement associated with essential hypertension is left ventricular hypertrophy. A number of, but not all, effective antihypertensive drugs will regress left ventricular hypertrophy. Our attention has focused on the hemodynamic characteristics of those drugs that either directly or indirectly alter sympathetic nervous activity. alpha-Methyldopa has been widely studied in both experimental animals and hypertensive man and been found to be efficacious in lowering arterial pressure and regressing left ventricular hypertrophy. Another centrally acting antihypertensive drug, clonidine, produces similar hemodynamic effects but has no effect on left ventricular hypertrophy at similar hypotensive levels. Vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil reflexly stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and may actually exacerbate left ventricular hypertrophy when given alone. In combination with beta adrenergic blocking agents, however, a reduction in both arterial pressure and cardiac mass may occur. Prolonged treatment with these antihypertensive agents had no detrimental effect on regional blood flows including myocardial flow. Ventricular performance studies indicate that regression of hypertrophy improves ventricular performance although the heart with regressed hypertrophy, when faced with an increased afterload, may still demonstrate impaired performance.", 
    "40": "An appreciation of the cardiac effects of antihypertensive drugs and important pharmacologic advances in the past 10 years have permitted a more rational approach to the management of the patient with both coronary artery disease and hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy. Since this is a particularly high-risk group of patients, early detection and optimal management of ischemic symptoms and hypertension are necessary. Beta-blocking agents are ideal agents (in the absence of heart failure) since their efficacy has been proved in both coronary artery disease and hypertension. Similarly, calcium slow-channel blocking agents have both antianginal and antihypertensive properties. When arterial pressure reduction is needed quickly, caution is required in the choice of an agent since adverse reflexive cardiac effects may occur, particularly with pure arteriolar dilators. If a diuretic is required, serum potassium levels should be carefully monitored since both coronary artery disease and left ventricular hypertrophy already increase the risk of life-threatening dysrhythmias. The decrease in mortality from coronary heart disease seen in the past 10 years is likely to be further improved by specific attention to management of such high-risk groups as those with associated hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "41": "The protein toxin present in Bordetella pertussis vaccine blocks the inhibition of adenylate cyclase by prostaglandins and adenosine which may be secondary to ADP-ribosylation of an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The stimulatory effects of alpha 1-catecholamine agonists on 32P uptake into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol in isolated rat adipocytes were virtually abolished by pertussis toxin treatment. In contrast, the stimulatory effects of insulin were increased in adipocytes after pertussis toxin treatment. Pertussis toxin treatment did not alter insulin stimulation of glucose oxidation and actually increased glucose conversion to lipid. Basal lipolysis was elevated in adipocytes by pertussis toxin treatment but not basal cyclic AMP. However, the increases in cyclic AMP and lipolysis due to low concentrations of catecholamines and forskolin were markedly potentiated by pertussis toxin treatment. The inhibitory effects of adenosine on cyclic AMP stimulation due to catecholamines were abolished by pertussis toxin. These data indicate that pertussis toxin selectively interferes with inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in rat adipocytes by adenosine, potentiates the increases in cyclic AMP due to catecholamines, increases the stimulatory effects of insulin on adipocyte metabolism, and interferes with alpha 1-catecholamine stimulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover.", 
    "42": "Remarkable advances have been made in the management of cardiac disease in the last 20 years, but antiarrhythmic drug strategy in the acute phase of myocardial infarction remains less than satisfactory. Primary ventricular fibrillation (VF), once considered predictable on the basis of detection of \"warning arrhythmias,\" cannot be anticipated. Management must be either expectant or prophylactic. Restriction of drug use to selected patients and the apparent lack of effect of VF on late prognosis argue for the former approach, yet safe and effective prevention of VF is an attractive therapeutic goal. High-dose intravenous lidocaine probably offers efficacy but the risk-benefit ratio of this regimen is still debated. Adoption of a prophylactic regimen mandates drug administration to a large number of patients who either are not at risk of developing VF (noninfarct patients) or who are destined not to develop VF (70 to 95% of infarct patients). Ventricular arrhythmias other than VF are common in acute infarction and, for emotional rather than scientific reasons, often are aggressively treated. Little evidence exists to support this management. Few ventricular arrhythmias at this time in infarction have either immediate importance or prognostic significance. Reevaluation of antiarrhythmic drug use and arrhythmia treatment in acute myocardial infarction is long overdue. However, there is a paucity of controlled data upon which to base new strategies, and clinical research in this field is hampered by ethical considerations, by rigidly held but unscientifically based beliefs and by a lack of fundamental knowledge of arrhythmia mechanisms and their significance.", 
    "43": "The presence of metabolites with pharmacologic activity can produce unanticipated drug efficacy or toxicity. This is particularly true during treatment with drugs that have narrow therapeutic-toxic ratios, such as the antiarrhythmic agents. The presence of active metabolites can often be inferred from variability in the relation between pharmacologic effect and steady-state plasma concentrations of the parent drug. Moreover, metabolites may ordinarily be unimportant but can accumulate to therapeutic (or toxic) levels in disease states such as congestive heart failure, renal failure and hepatic failure. Further characterization of the contribution of such metabolites during treatment requires direct evaluation of their pharmacology in vitro, in animal models and, if indicated, in man. Procainamide and its active metabolite N-acetylprocainamide provide the best and most complete example of this sequence of observations. Other drugs, including quinidine, disopyramide, verapamil and the investigational agents encainide and lorcainide, have active metabolites for which pharmacologic activity is less well-defined. Further studies in this area will help reduce the frequency of antiarrhythmic drug adverse effects, make successful therapy more frequent, and perhaps allow insights into structure-activity relations.", 
    "44": "The function of the syncytiotrophoblast in maternal-fetal exchange is related to the properties of its microvillous (maternal-facing) and basal (fetal-facing) plasma membranes. We have previously reported the properties of the microvillous membrane (Smith, C.H., Nelson, D.M., King, B.F., Donohue, T.M., Ruzycki, S.M. and Kelley, L.K. (1977) Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 128, 190-196), and now describe the purification and partial characterization of the basal plasma membrane. Sonication and incubation with EDTA were used to isolate selectively the basal cell membrane. These steps were followed by a more conventional purification by centrifugation. The trophoblast was disrupted and its microvillous membrane and cytoplasmic contents were removed by sonication. The exposed basal cell membrane was selectively released from the underlying basal lamina by sonication in the presence of EDTA and further purified by discontinuous Ficoll gradient centrifugation. The material at the 4-10% Ficoll interface consisted of smooth membrane vesicles with internal microfilaments. It was 45-fold enriched in dihydroalprenolol binding activity and 11-fold enriched in ouabain binding activity. Other enzymatic analyses, including alkaline phosphatase, cytochrome-c oxidase, cytochrome-c reductase and galactosyl transferase indicated low contamination by other organelles. This procedure yields a preparation of relatively high purity which should be suitable for investigation of transport and other functions of the basal surface membrane of trophoblast. In principle, the purification procedures used may be applicable to other transporting epithelia.", 
    "45": "In 8 ambulatory patients with stable essential hypertension (WHO grade I and II) the effects of a new beta-blocker with marked sympathomimetic activity on arterial blood pressure, creatinin clearance and renal plasma flow, as measured by total PAH clearance (constant infusion technique), were studied. In contrast to previous findings no significant reduction in creatinin clearance or renal blood flow was observed during a 3-5 weeks' observation period. The small reduction in calculated renal vascular resistance was not statistically significant. In addition to its postulated peripheral vasodilatory effect, bufuralol appears to interfere less than propranolol with renal hemodynamics and renal excretory function.", 
    "46": "Sodium ascorbate addition caused a modest loss in the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) in a rat cortical membrane preparation. Sodium ascorbate also caused a modest increase in lipid peroxide formation in the membrane preparation. Both the lipid peroxidation and the loss in [3H]DHA binding were greatly potentiated by the addition of low levels of iron (Fe2+). A kinetic analysis indicated that the iron/ascorbate caused a loss in the number of [3H]DHA binding sites but had no effect on the affinity of [3H]DHA for the binding site. Both the lipid peroxidation and the loss of [3H]DHA binding were prevented by iron chelating agents (e.g. EDTA) and by classical inhibitors of lipid peroxidation (e.g. propyl gallate, cobalt chloride). All of these data taken together suggest that an iron-dependent lipid peroxidation results in a loss of [3H]DHA binding sites. These and other data further suggest that lipid is critical for the binding of [3H]DHA to its receptor.", 
    "47": "The effects of alloimmune sera on the contractile tension and frequency of spontaneously beating isolated mouse atria were explored. Immune sera enhanced frequency as well as tension; both effects were blocked by the presence of propranolol. In contrast, pretreatment with 6-OH dopamine potentiated the stimulatory action of immune sera.", 
    "48": "Recently, we reported that adrenaline can stimulate the secretion of immunoreactive beta-endorphin in the rat. This response is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and requires circulating adrenaline concentrations which are known to occur during stress. We therefore studied whether catecholamines are implicated in the stress-induced secretion of immunoreactive beta-endorphin from the pituitary gland. We report here that in rat the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)propranolol reduces or abolishes the rapid increase of immunoreactive beta-endorphin levels during some stress stimuli (footshock, passive avoidance, restraint) but not during others (ether, formalin, laparotomy). The propranolol-sensitive response is largely prevented by extirpation of the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland but is unaffected by dexamethasone, which inhibits peptide secretion from the corticotroph cells of the anterior lobe. These results suggest that catecholamines activate the release of immunoreactive beta-endorphin from the intermediate lobe but not from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland during certain stress conditions.", 
    "49": "In the present work the effects of a 55-day oral treatment with two beta-blocking agents (propranolol 40 mg/kg per day and S 2395 20 mg/kg per day) on the catecholamine (CA) content of central and peripheral structures were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The concentrations of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) in different structures dissected out from treated and control SHR were measured by a radioenzymatic method. At the peripheral level, no change in the concentration of NA (in the heart) or A (in the adrenal medulla) was observed. Propranolol increased the DA concentration in the C1 and C2 regions of the medulla oblongata and S 2395 increased the DA concentration only in the C2 region. In these two areas, the NA and A levels were unchanged. Both propranolol and S 2395 increased the DA, NA and A content in the locus coeruleus and in the anterior hypothalamus. On the contrary, there was no modification in the posterior hypothalamus. The anatomical specificity of these alterations of the CA levels suggests that they could be related to a specific action of beta-blockers on central catecholaminergic structures in SHR which might be linked to the antihypertensive effects of these drugs.", 
    "50": "Human foreskin fibroblasts produce the protease plasminogen activator, as shown by the ability of cell extracts to lyse 125I-labelled fibrin in the presence of plasminogen. Cellular plasminogen activator was stimulated up to 3-fold by 0.01-10 microM epinephrine, norepinephrine, or isoproterenol. Increases in plasminogen activator were slow in onset (24 h) and long-lived (greater than 48 h), and were abolished by 10 micrograms/ml of cycloheximide or 1 microgram/ml of actinomycin D, suggesting de novo synthesis of the protease. Stimulation of plasminogen activator by catecholamines was inhibited by 10 microM propranolol but not by 10 microM phentolamine, suggesting the involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors. Catecholamines stimulated plasminogen activator only in the presence of fetal bovine serum; under serum-free conditions they were inhibitory. Serum did not appear to alter the uptake and metabolism of epinephrine during incubation with fibroblasts. The ability of fetal bovine serum to support the induction of plasminogen activator by either 1 microM epinephrine or 3 microM prostaglandin E1 was maintained following dialysis but lost on heating (70 degrees C, 10 min) or acidification (pH 2.5). Human and calf sera supported the stimulatory effects of prostaglandin E1 but not of epinephrine. These results indicate that serum may influence the synthesis of plasminogen activator in cultured cells by modifying their response to vasoactive hormones.", 
    "51": "The synthesis of N-acetylserotonin (NAS) in the pineal gland is dependent upon the activity of the enzymes tryptophan-hydroxylase, 1-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and N-acetyltransferase. Pineal N-acetyltransferase activity is regulated by the level of B-adrenergic activation. N-acetylserotonin (NAS) has also been identified in extra-pineal brain tissue. In order to investigate whether extra-pineal brain NAS levels are regulated by tryptophan hydroxylase and B-adrenergic activity, the effects of tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitors (parachlorophenylalanine and 6-fluoro-tryptophan) and adrenergic drugs (l-isoproterenol and propranolol) were examined. NAS was evaluated in the cerebellum of the rat using quantitative NAS-immunohistochemistry. A significant decrease in NAS-immunofluorescence was observed after tryptophan hydroxylase inhibition. Treatment with l-isoproterenol, a B-adrenergic agonist, resulted in a significant increase in NAS-immunofluorescence intensity. This effect was blocked by propranolol, a B-adrenergic blocking agent. These data indicate that the synthesis of NAS, in the cerebellum utilizes the established serotonin pathway and that NAS synthesis in the cerebellum is regulated by a B-adrenergic mechanism similar to that in the pineal gland.", 
    "52": "Isolated guinea pig atria stimulated to contract isometrically were used to determine whether adenosine at a concentration that does not cause a direct depressant effect on peak contractile force, rate of force development, and rate of relaxation was capable of influencing the elevation in these contractile parameters caused by an increase in preload, paired electrical stimulation, an increase in contraction frequency, and catecholamine stimulation in K+-depolarized and nondepolarized atrial muscle. Adenosine had no effect on the contractile parameters that were enhanced by an increase in preload or paired electrical stimulation. The nucleoside reduced the increases in the contractile parameters produced by isoproterenol stimulation, an increase in contraction frequency, and isoproterenol-induced contractions in depolarized atria. All adenosine reductions were inhibited by theophylline, an antagonist of adenosine actions. The adenosine reduction of the elevated contractile parameters caused by increasing contraction frequency was not prevented by atropine (a muscarinic antagonist) or propranolol (a beta-adrenergic blocking agent). These results suggest that adenosine at a concentration that does not produce direct negative inotropic responses is capable of attenuating the elevation in contractility elicited by catecholamine stimulation, an increase in contraction frequency, and catecholamine-induced contractions in depolarized atria. However, the reduction by adenosine of the contractile responses elicited by an increase in contraction frequency appears to be independent of catecholamines.", 
    "53": "Thirty patients with essential hypertension participated in a double blind crossover trial in which they were randomly allocated to treatment with either once daily slow release metoprolol (200 mg) with placebo or once daily slow release metoprolol (200 mg) with chlorthalidone (25 mg). Ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure was recorded continuously for 24-48 hours before treatment and two months after each change in regimen. The response of blood pressure and pulse rate to a standard exercise protocol that included supine rest and tilt, isometric, and dynamic bicycle exercise was measured during the same recording periods. Both treatments appreciably reduced blood pressure and pulse rate; mean daytime intra-arterial blood pressure was reduced from 174/95 mm Hg to 158/85 mm Hg by metoprolol plus placebo and to 143/78 mm Hg by metoprolol plus chlorthalidone. This reduction with the combined treatment was significantly greater than with metoprolol and placebo (p systolic = 0.001, p diastolic = 0.004). Mean night time pressures were reduced from 148/78 mm Hg to 139/75 mm Hg by metoprolol plus placebo and to 116/61 mm Hg by metoprolol plus chlorthalidone. Again the reduction in blood pressure was significantly greater with combined treatment (p less than 0.001) than with metoprolol plus placebo. Once daily slow release metoprolol is effective in controlling blood pressure, but this effect is greatly enhanced by the addition of a diuretic.", 
    "54": "The mechanism of receptor-induced activation of adenylate cyclase has been proposed to involve an enhanced exchange of GDP for GTP. The kinetics of this process have not been investigated so far in the brain due to a spontaneous activation of the enzyme by guanyl nucleotides, which precludes the ability to follow receptor-dependent events. We show that it is possible to investigate the mechanism of receptor action in such systems by using a combination of guanosine 5'-(beta-gamma-imino)triphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) and guanosine 5'-(2-O-thio)diphosphate (GDP beta S). In pineal membranes, beta-adrenergic agonists increase the rate of adenylate cyclase activation by 10 or 100 microM Gpp(NH)p about 40-fold (0.023-0.9 min-1 kact) and decrease the inhibitory potency of GDP beta S nearly 1000-fold. As a result, 100 microM GDP beta S which blocks 90% of the activation by 10 microM Gpp(NH)p has no inhibitory effect in the presence of 10 microM Gpp(NH)p and 10 microM noradrenaline or isoproterenol. In caudate nucleus, dopamine does not appear to increase the rate of activation of adenylate cyclase by 10 microM Gpp(NH)p. Nevertheless, 100 microM GDP beta S blocks 90% of the activation by 10 microM Gpp(NH)p but has no inhibitory effects in the presence of dopamine. Thus, one can demonstrate that even weakly activating receptors have the capacity to facilitate a functional exchange of GDP beta S for Gpp(NH)p and measure the efficacy of the interaction between the receptor and the functionally linked guanyl nucleotide subunit.", 
    "55": "In vitro lipolysis by adrenaline, adrenaline + phentolamine (alpha-blocker) and isoprenalin (beta-agonist) was studied in deltoid and trochanter adipose tissues of sixteen obese females (10 android and 6 gynoid). Lipolysis differs in the upper and lower parts of the body. The more the obesity predominates in the upper part of the body, the more this difference is significant. If the actions of adrenaline in gynoid obese women are identical in deltoid and trochanter adipose tissues, the alpha-antilipolytic effect is more powerful than the beta-antilipolytic effect on the trochanter adipose tissue of android obese women.", 
    "56": "In order to study rabbit mononuclear cell surface receptors, it was necessary to develop a procedure to isolate mononuclear cell preparations that are free of significant contamination by other cell types, especially platelets. Centrifugation of dextran-sedimented, anti-coagulated whole blood through Hypaque (density 1.060) at 600 X g for 5 min at 22 degrees C eliminated greater than 93% of starting platelets. A second 5-min Hypaque centrifugation of Hypaque-Ficoll-isolated mononuclear cells (MNC) (approximately 80% lymphocytes) at 450 X g for 5 min at 22 degrees C reduced platelet contamination to less than one platelet per three MNC, and resulted in the overall removal of greater than 99.5% of starting platelets. These relatively pure MNC which were isolated in less than 2 hr were identified as having beta-adrenergic receptors by radioligand binding techniques using [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol [( 125I]IHYP). Binding of [125I]IHYP to intact rabbit MNC was a saturable, stereospecific, and rapid process with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.53 +/- 0.18 nM and a binding capacity of 3,461 +/- 235 sites/cell.", 
    "57": "The aetiology of retroperitoneal fibrosis is unknown. From time to time different drugs have been suggested as a cause, including beta adrenoceptor blocking agents. The notes of 100 hospital inpatients in whom retroperitoneal fibrosis had been diagnosed were surveyed to identify the date of onset of symptoms, the drugs prescribed before then, and the blood pressures on admission. Seventy one patients had diastolic pressures on admission of 90 mm Hg or more and 53 of these had pressures of at least 100 mm Hg despite 14 of the patients taking anti-hypertensive drugs at the time. Six patients had received beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents before the onset of symptoms and a further 24 received them subsequently. In particular, three patients continued treatment for at least six years after the diagnosis was made and surgery performed, without suffering a recurrence of retroperitoneal fibrosis. Besides beta-adrenoceptor drugs, diuretics and other hypotensive drugs were taken in amounts reflecting the pattern of drug use among hypertensive patients generally. Rather than being causal agents, the antihypertensive drugs were probably being used to treat hypertension associated with the retroperitoneal fibrosis, and our findings suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents do not cause retroperitoneal fibrosis.", 
    "58": "The effects of propranolol alone or associated with atrial pacing were studied on regional myocardial blood flows (RMBF) and regional contractility (sonocardiometry) in non-ischemic, moderately and severely ischemic areas of the canine myocardium. In non-ischemic areas, propranolol reduced both epicardial and endocardial flows, increased the endo/epi ratio and decreased regional contractility. The reductions in subendocardial flow and function were correlated. In moderately and severely ischemic areas, propranolol increased subendocardial flow, reduced subepicardial flow, increased the endo/epi ratio and preserved or even slightly improved regional contractility. There was a good correlation between the propranolol-induced protective effects on regional contractility and the drug-induced increase in subendocardial flow since under atrial pacing subendocardial flow no longer increased and regional function dropped dramatically.", 
    "59": "An in vivo method is described to demonstrate vascular beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist activity. Agonist activity was shown by the ability of i.v. injected compounds to reduce blood pressure in ganglion-blocked, phenoxybenzamine-treated, angiotensin II-supported rats. Procaterol was employed to assess the relative beta 2 blocking activity of propranolol IPS 339 and atenolol. Arunlakshana and Schild analysis of the data revealed that all these compounds were competitively beta 2 antagonists, their relative potencies being 100 : 80 : 0.56 respectively.", 
    "60": "The beta-adrenergic stimulants isoprenaline, salbutamol and clenbuterol decreased motor activity, reduced the interest of fasting mice in food pellets ('Tantale' test), and antagonized high-dose apomorphine hypothermia. Clenbuterol was 16--60 times more potent than the other two agonists in all tests, apparently because of better crossing into the C.N.S. The beta-adrenergic blockers, d,l-propranolol and l-penbutolol, completely antagonized the effects of salbutamol and clenbuterol in tests of motor activity and apomorphine hypothermia, penbutolol being 30--60 times more active than propranolol, perhaps due to its greater lipid solubility. The Tantale test allows unambiguous differentiation between penbutolol and propranolol. While the first completely blocked the effects of clenbuterol and salbutamol, the second was effective only within a narrow dose range. Finally, the dose-effect relationships of the 3 agonists were parallel in the Tantale test, while they were divergent in the other two. This suggests that different classes of beta-adrenergic receptors may be involved in the various test.", 
    "61": "The nonspecific interaction of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol and timolol, with model and biological membranes has been investigated. Radioisotope measurements of the association of these drugs with dimyristoyl lecithin (DMPC) bilayers showed that both propranolol and timolol had a significantly greater molar association (mole of drug per mole of lipid) with DMPC above its phase transition temperature than below. Timolol had a much lower molar association with DMPC as compared with propranolol both above and below the phase transition temperature. For the DMPC model membrane system, the molar association of propranolol as measured by radioisotope and inferred from calorimetric studies was similar. Neutron diffraction utilizing propranolol deuterated in the naphthalene moiety showed that the naphthalene moiety of propranolol partitions into the hydrocarbon core of the DMPC lipid bilayer, and that the charged amine side chain is most likely positioned in the aqueous phospholipid head group region. For timolol, the association as measured by radioisotope methods was apparently greater than the partitioning inferred from calorimetric studies using freezing point depression analysis, suggesting a more complex interaction of timolol as compared with propranolol with the DMPC lipid bilayer. The association of propranolol and timolol with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (SR) was similar to that with highly purified protein-depleted SR lipids, and DMPC above its phase transition. The association of propranolol with the SR membrane (mole of propranolol per mole of SR phospholipid) correlated with its ability to inhibit calcium uptake, whereas only a fraction of the total association of timolol with the SR membrane appeared to lead to inhibition of calcium uptake. These results suggest that the major nonspecific interactions of propranolol and timolol are with the SR membrane lipids, and that the magnitude of their interactions depends on both the lipid solubility of the drug and the physical state of the fatty acyl chains of the membrane. Both propranolol and timolol appear to perturb the functional properties of the calcium pump protein in the SR membrane (inhibition of ATP-induced calcium uptake) indirectly by partitioning into the bulk lipid matrix of the SR lipid bilayer, although other sites of interaction cannot be excluded.", 
    "62": "Arterial hypertension that occurs after severe head injury is characterized by elevation of systolic blood pressure, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, normal or decreased peripheral vascular resistance, and increased circulating catecholamines. The effects of two drugs used in the management of hypertension, propranolol and hydralazine, on these indices of cardiovascular function were examined in six head-injured patients. Both drugs effectively normalized blood pressure. However, hydralazine increased heart rate by 30%, cardiac index by 49%, left cardiac work by 21%, and pulmonary venous admixture by 53%, and was responsible for an increase in intracranial pressure or decreased compliance in two patients. Hydralazine produced no consistent change in arterial catecholamines. In contrast, propranolol decreased heart rate by 21%, cardiac index by 26%, left cardiac work by 35%, pulmonary venous admixture by 15%, and oxygen consumption by 18%. Propranolol decreased arterial epinephrine levels by 48% and norepinephrine levels by 28%. Propranolol appears to be a useful antihypertensive drug in the hyperdynamic head-injured patient because it normalizes blood pressure and the underlying hemodynamic abnormalities both by its beta-adrenergic blocking action and by decreasing circulating levels of catecholamines.", 
    "63": "The rate of aqueous humor formation was determined in the cynomolgus monkey eyes by a tracer dilution technique. One 25-gauge needle was inserted into the posterior chamber and a solution of fluorescein labeled dextran with a molecular weight of 40,000 was infused at a constant rate. The aqueous humor was collected through a needle inserted into the anterior chamber, while the intraocular pressure (IOP) was maintained at a constant level. The aqueous humor formation rate and the dye distribution volume were calculated from the time profile of the dye concentration in the effluent aqueous humor. By means of this technique, the effects of pilocarpine, salbutamol, and timolol on the aqueous humor formation rate were studied. The test drug solution was administered into the conjunctival reservoir during a 90-min period before measurements and also during the measurement so that a steady-state drug concentration was maintained in the anterior chamber during the measurement. Pilocarpine 0.1% reduced the aqueous humor formation rate to approximately 50% of the control without significantly changing the IOP or the distribution volume. Salbutamol 0.5%, a beta-adrenergic agonist, increased the rate by about 38%, but timolol 0.1%, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, reduced the rate by an average of 36%. Timolol caused a statistically significant lowering of the IOP by about 2 mmHg. Simultaneous administration of salbutamol 0.5% and timolol 0.2% caused no change in the aqueous humor formation rate or the IOP. The barrier function of the blood aqueous barrier was not altered by these drugs as revealed by aqueous protein determinations.", 
    "64": "In order to evaluate the effects of timolol, a new beta-adrenergic blocking agent, on exercise-induced left ventricular wall motion abnormalities, we studied nine patients with chronic, angiographically-documented coronary artery disease. A computerized technique for determining apical, anteroseptal and inferoposterior regional ejection fractions during gated radionuclide ventriculography was used to assess left ventricular dysfunction. During exercise prior to the administration of timolol, the apical regional ejection fraction fell from 0.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.51 +/- 0.08 (p less than .01). The anteroseptal ejection fraction fell from 0.50 +/- 0.08 to 0.41 +/- 0.05 (p less than .05), and the inferoposterior ejection fraction fell from 0.75 +/- 0.10 to 0.59 +/- 0.06 (p less than .05). Three days after beginning therapy with 10-30 mg of timolol, this reduction was markedly attenuated. The apical ejection fraction fell from 0.59 +/- 0.09 to 0.54 +/- 0.08 (p = NS), the anteroseptal ejection fraction fell from 0.49 +/- 0.07 to 0.47 +/- 0.18 (p = NS) and the inferoposterior ejection fraction fell from 0.62 +/- 0.06 to 0.59 +/- 0.07 (p = NS). Furthermore, several individual regions showed increases in ejection fraction. This study demonstrates a previously unreported and beneficial anti-ischemic effect of timolol.", 
    "65": "It has been suggested that alteration in the apparent oral bioavailability of propranolol taken with food may be due to a transient increase in QH. To investigate this hypothesis more closely, the time course of effect of a high-protein meal on QH was examined with the model compound ICG. Forty minutes postprandial, the mean increase in estimated QH was 69% above the control. QH was still elevated a mean of 36% at 100 min but by 280 min had decreased to a value that did not differ from control. Computer simulations were performed to predict the magnitude of change in the apparent oral bioavailability of propranolol that would be expected based on the observed QH changes. These simulations suggest that simple changes in QH alone cannot account for the increase in apparent oral bioavailability when propranolol is taken with food.", 
    "66": "Ten men with stable angina not fully relieved by optimal doses of propranolol were given on each of four mornings a single dose of 10 mg nifedipine, 120 mg verapamil, isosorbide dinitrate (5 to 30 mg, previously titrated to lower systolic blood pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg), or placebo, in double-blind fashion. Bicycle exercise to angina was performed hourly for 8 hr thereafter. All three vasodilators increased exercise time by at least 50% by the first hour (p less than .001), with a gradually diminishing effect persisting for 6 to 8 hr (p less than .01). Although for the group there were no differences in magnitude and duration of effect among the three drugs, in five of the individual patients there were important differences in response favoring one or another vasodilator. We conclude that nifedipine, verapamil, and isosorbide dinitrate are equally effective and reasonably long-acting antianginal supplements to propranolol, although some patients may benefit more from one than another of the three.", 
    "67": "Ethanol dependence was induced in rats by intragastric administration of ethanol. Clonidine (0.1 mg/kg ip) suppressed withdrawal reaction while yohimbine (2.5 mg/kg ip) produced an opposite effect. Propranolol (2.0 mg/kg ip) reduced withdrawal convulsions but not locomotor hyperactivity while prazosin (1.0 mg/kg ip) attenuated only the latter symptom. Electrolytic lesions in the ventral noradrenergic bundle slightly increased locomotor activity in ethanol-dependent rats but failed to change the convulsions. Our result indicates that drugs acting upon alpha and beta adrenoceptors are able to reduce the severity of certain withdrawal reactions in ethanol-dependent rats.", 
    "68": "Changes in shock-elicited fighting (SEF) were measured following single or repeated injections (IP) of dl-propranolol (5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg) or quipazine (1.25 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg) given either alone or in combination to saline or desipramine (DMI) (10 mg/kg) treated rats. DMI + propranolol (20 mg/kg) caused a greater increase in fighting than DMI + saline 18 hours after last dose. Propranolol (20 mg/kg) produced an equal inhibition in both of these groups at 15 min. Propranolol (5 mg/kg) had no effect. Quipazine (2.5 mg/kg) failed to alter DMI induced increase in SEF. The combination of propranolol (5 mg/kg) + quipazine (1.25 mg/kg) blocked the enhanced SEF significantly in DMI treated rats in comparison to DMI + saline treated group. This combination of propranolol + quipazine produced no significant change in SEF in saline treated group in comparison to the pretest level. These results suggested that propranolol + quipazine act synergistically at low doses to inhibit the increased SEF seen in DMI treated rats and might have therapeutic implications for the management of irritable aggression or mania.", 
    "69": "When fed furazolidone, 700 ppm, with their mash, most turkey poults develop dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by gross left ventricular dilatation with thinning of both the left ventricular free wall and ventricular septum. Birds fed propranolol, but not digoxin, did not develop this cardiomyopathy. It is not known what pharmacologic property of propranolol conferred protection or if mammals would receive similar protection."
