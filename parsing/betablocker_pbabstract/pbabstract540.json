The aim of this study was to determine if stimulation of a beta-adrenoceptor on endothelial cells could release an endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) similar to that released by acetylcholine. 2. In dog coronary rings preconstricted with PGF2 alpha or serotonin, removal of the endothelium did not alter the relaxant responses to isoprenaline. However, in rings preconstricted with the thromboxane-mimetic U46619, removal of the endothelium enhanced the response to isoprenaline. 3. The vasorelaxant responses to isoprenaline in endothelium-denuded rings were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the specific beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP-20712A (3-100 nmol/l), but were not altered by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551 (30 nmol/l). 4. The vasorelaxant responses to isoprenaline in the presence of CGP-20712A (30 nmol/l) or ICI-118551 (30 nmol/l) were not impaired by removal of the endothelium. 5. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant responses to acetylcholine and bradykinin were not altered by isoprenaline (0.1 mumol/l) in the presence of CGP-20712A (30 nmol/l). 6. Therefore, the beta-adrenoceptors on dog coronary artery smooth muscle which produce relaxation are predominantly of the beta 1-subtype. Stimulation of any beta 2-adrenoceptors on the endothelium in dog coronary artery does not release EDRF, and does not modulate endothelium-dependent vasodilatation induced by other agents.", 
    "1": "Female Wistar-strain rats were starved for 14-19 days by feeding approximately 1/4 of the amount consumed by ad libitum fed controls. The body weight was reduced by 41% and the heart weight by 38% in these starving periods. The 125I-iodocyanopindrol (ICYP) binding capacity of heart preparations from the starved rats was 35.3 +/- 11.1 (mean +/- SD) fmol/mg protein in comparison with 69.3 +/- 14.9 for the controls. Serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine and TSH levels as well as pituitary TSH contents were markedly lower in the starved rats. One group of them further received 20 ng of T3 daily after the 8th day of the experiment. The body weight decreased by 47% of the controls but the ICYP binding capacity recovered to 56.3 +/- 10.9 fmol/mg protein. There was no difference in association constants of the receptors in these three groups. It was concluded that quasi-chronic starvation in rats caused a remarkable decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in heart and this was partly offset by the substitution of T3.", 
    "2": "The effect of cumulatively applied carteolol alone 10(-8) M to 10(-6) M on [3H] release evoked by transmural field stimulation at 5 Hz was studied in renal and mesenteric arteries preloaded with [3H]-norepinephrine, from prehypertensive 4 weeks old and hypertensive 14 weeks old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). The [3H] release in renal and mesenteric arteries from young SHR was greater than that from age-matched WKY, whereas there was no difference of the parameter in both arteries from adult rats of both strains. In renal arteries, carteolol 10(-6) M inhibited [3H] release in young SHR and the inhibition differed from no effect in age-matched WKY, but the inhibition was not seen in adult SHR and WKY. In mesenteric arteries, carteolol 10(-7) M and 10(-6) M concentration-dependently inhibited [3H] release in young SHR and WKY, the antagonist 10(-6) M inhibited the parameter in adult SHR and WKY and the inhibition in young SHR was greater than that in age-matched WKY, whereas the inhibition in adult SHR was smaller than that in age-matched WKY. Presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors may function tonically to facilitate the release of norepinephrine in renal arteries from young SHR and in mesenteric arteries from young and adult SHR and WKY. The modifications of these adrenoceptors in young SHR appear to have causal relevance to development of the hypertension.", 
    "3": "The investigations were carried out on 28 samples of human semen with asthenozoospermia. The experiments were performed in three groups of semen, adding to the first one 0.34 mM of propranolol and 0.025 mM of isoprenaline, to the second one the double dose and to the last one the fivefold dose of the drugs. The lowest concentrations of the drugs applied in our investigations result from the used therapeutic intravenous doses for people. The proportional content of moving sperma was evaluated under the phase-contrast microscope at the 5, 30, 60, 120 and 240 minute of the experiment. The addition of 0.34 mM of propranolol caused a decrease of the sperm motility but only after 60 minutes and for a short period of time. However, the addition of the double and the fivefold doses of the drug led to immediate and significant reduction of the sperm motility. The lowest dose of isoprenaline markedly increased the sperm activity in comparison with the control values but not earlier than 120 minutes after the addition. The further increase in dose showed no effect on the moving sperm percentage increase, merely accelerating this effect.", 
    "4": "Electrophysiological effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 [(3 alpha-tropanyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxylic acid ester] were investigated in guinea pig isolated heart preparations. ICS 205-930 prolonged the functional refractory period and decreased the force of contraction in left driven atria. It decreased spontaneous beating rate in right atria. These effects were concentration dependent between 3 X 10(-6) and 10(-4) mol/l of ICS 205-930. In fast action potentials of papillary muscles ICS 205-930 concentration-dependently depressed Vmax and prolonged the action potential duration (APD) between 10(-6) and 10(-5) mol/l. The action potential amplitude (APA) and the resting membrane potential (RMP) remained unchanged. In papillary muscles partially depolarized by high K+ (22 mmol/l) and reactivated by high voltage stimulation, slow response APs were prolonged by ICS 205-930 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-5) mol. Vmax, APA and RMP were not affected. Similar effects on APD were obtained with sotalol (3 X 10(-5) mol/l), an inhibitor of outward K+ current. The slow-APD prolongation induced by ICS 205-930 as well as by sotalol was reversed by BRL 34915 (6-cyano-3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyltrans-4-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidyl )-2H-benzo[b]pyran-3-ol), known to open K+ channels. BRL 34915 alone reduced slow-APD stereoselectively. The results suggest that ICS 205-930 may inhibit and BRL 34915 may stimulate the K+ conductance of guinea pig myocardial cell membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The cardiovascular beta-blocking effects of bornaprolol were studied in healthy male volunteers after four single oral doses. The inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia was monitored for 72 h in six subjects, and the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia and rise of systolic blood pressure were monitored for 167 h in six other subjects. Plasma drug concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. Bornaprolol significantly reduced the resting heart rate, isoproterenol- and exercise-induced tachycardia, and effort hypertension. The peak effect was obtained within 1-2 h of drug administration and was correlated with dose. The effect on the isoproterenol test remained significant for 6 h after administration of 40 mg bornaprolol, and 72 h after 80, 120, and 240 mg. The effect of bornaprolol on the exercise test in comparison with placebo was significant during 23 h (120 and 240 mg) and 47 h (480 and 960 mg). A positive relationship was found for both tests between the maximum effect and the doses administered. A correlation was also found for each group of subjects between the time course of the plasma drug concentration and the effects of each bornaprolol dose on isoproterenol- and exercise-induced tachycardia. The beta-blocking effects in individual subjects, however, often continued long after the disappearance of detectable plasma drug concentrations.", 
    "6": "To test the hypothesis that naloxone exerts a direct positive inotropic effect on the cardiac muscle, we employed two in vitro models. In one set of experiments we demonstrated that injection of 1 mg naloxone into an isolated perfused rat heart produced a significant increase in the amplitude of contraction. In another set of experiments we exposed an isolated and spontaneously contracting rat right atrium in a tissue bath to naloxone, and demonstrated that the amplitude of contraction increased significantly within a few minutes of naloxone administration. We showed that this effect of naloxone was not related to opiate receptors, since a similar effect was obtained with d-naloxone (the stereoisomer that is inactive as an opiate antagonist) and it was not affected by pretreatment with morphine. We also demonstrated that addition of alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and propranolol, in doses that effectively block alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists, did not have any effect on naloxone's inotropic action. We validated our results in two electrically driven strips of human atrial myocardium in the tissue bath. A positive inotropic response to naloxone, measured as an increase of 80 and 50% in the amplitude of contraction, was noted. We postulate that naloxone's previously described cardiovascular pressor effect in states of shock may not only be related to reversal of the effects of endorphins but also to its direct inotropic action.", 
    "7": "Sympathetic neurons dissociated from the superior cervical ganglion of 2-day-old rats were studied by whole-cell patch clamp and by fura-2 measurements of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i. Step depolarizations in the presence of tetrodotoxin and hexamethonium triggered two Ca2+ currents that differed in the voltage dependence of activation and kinetics of inactivation. These currents resemble the L and N currents previously described in chicken sensory neurons [Nowycky, M. C., Fox, A. P. & Tsien, R. W. (1985) Nature (London) 316, 440-442]. Treatment with acetylcholine resulted in the rapid (within seconds), selective, and reversible inhibition of the rapidly inactivated, N-type current, whereas the long-lasting L-type current remained unaffected. The high sensitivity to blocker drugs (atropine, pirenzepine) indicated that this effect of acetylcholine was due to a muscarinic M1 receptor. Intracellular perfusion with nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide analogs or pretreatment of the neurons with pertussis toxin had profound effects on the Ca2+ current modulation. Guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate caused the disappearance of the N-type current (an effect akin to that of acetylcholine, but irreversible), whereas guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate and pertussis toxin pretreatment prevented the acetylcholine-induced inhibition. In contrast, cAMP, applied intracellularly together with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, as well as activators and inhibitors of protein kinase C, were without effect. Acetylcholine caused shortening of action potentials in neurons treated with tetraethylammonium to partially block K+ channels. Moreover, when applied to neurons loaded with the fluorescent indicator fura-2, acetylcholine failed to appreciably modify [Ca2+]i at rest but caused a partial blunting of the initial [Ca2+]i peak induced by depolarization with high K+. This effect was blocked by muscarinic antagonists and pertussis toxin and was unaffected by protein kinase activators. Thus, muscarinic modulation of the N-type Ca2+ channels appears to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein and independent of both cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C.", 
    "8": "A multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind U.S. trial is comparing the combined effects of diet treatment and 1 of 5 active drug regimens with diet treatment alone, for the long-term management of middle-aged adults with \"mild\" hypertension. Factors stimulating this trial are data documenting the high prevalence of mild hypertension in the adult population; mild hypertension's responsibility for a high proportion of morbidity and mortality attributable to hypertension overall; data from long-term hypertension intervention trials showing reduced morbidity and mortality of people with mild hypertension with use of either diuretics or beta blockers as step-1 therapy, and other trials that failed to demonstrate beneficial impact on morbidity and mortality, possibly due to residual questions concerning aspects of benefit to risk ratios with these medications; recent data from trials showing long-term control of mild hypertension and other risk factors by nutritional means; lack of data from long-term trials on benefit to risk ratios with newer drugs such as selective alpha 1 inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers; paucity of data from trials on long-term combined effects of diet and drug therapy, and of diet alone, for people with mild hypertension. During the next few years, phase 1 of the trial will study 6 groups of drugs. The step-1 drugs are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril), alpha 1 inhibitor (doxazosin), beta blocker (acebutolol), calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), diuretic (chlorthalidone) and placebo. All participants are to receive vigorous sustained nutritional counseling to reduce obesity, moderate sodium intake and avoid heavy use of alcohol. Key endpoints for phase 1 of the study are the need for additional medication to control mild hypertension, side effects (i.e., clinical and biochemical) and consequent need to discontinue drug and quality of life. Phase-1 data are to be used to complete the phase-2 design, with the ultimate aim to assess effects on morbidity and mortality.", 
    "9": "The beta-adrenergic receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system has been investigated in normal and Werner's syndrome fibroblasts. The basal levels of cAMP in Werner and normal control cells were similar, whereas the isoproterenol-induced increase in cAMP levels was far less for Werner cells than for control cells. In the broken cell preparations isoproterenol stimulated the adenylate cyclase of only control cells, not of Werner cells, although NaF or prostaglandin E1 stimulated the enzyme of both cells to the same extent. The beta-adrenergic receptor concentrations analyzed with hydrophilic radioligand were nearly equal in Werner and in control cells. A reduction of functional activity of the beta-adrenergic receptor in Werner cells is thus suggested.", 
    "10": "The antihypertensive and lipid effects of doxazosin and atenolol were compared in a 10-week, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. The 129 adults enrolled had mild to moderate hypertension (average supine diastolic blood pressures for doxazosin, atenolol and placebo were 100.6, 101.0 and 99.7 mm Hg, respectively). Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with doxazosin, 1 to 16 mg daily, atenolol, 50 to 100 mg daily or placebo. Among 114 patients included in the efficacy analysis, standing blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) changed by -13/-11 mm Hg with doxazosin (n = 37), -12/-12 mm Hg with atenolol (n = 39) and +1/-1 mm Hg with placebo (n = 38). Mean reductions in blood pressure for doxazosin and atenolol were significantly greater than those for placebo (p less than 0.01), although no statistically significant differences between the active agents were noted. Serum lipid measurements were evaluable for 116 patients, and the 38 doxazosin-treated patients in this group experienced reductions in total cholesterol, total triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Both doxazosin and atenolol demonstrated comparable acceptance profiles. Doxazosin is an effective hypotensive agent with beneficial effects on serum lipid levels.", 
    "11": "In a double-blind multicenter study, the new alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitor doxazosin was compared with atenolol for efficacy, safety and effect on serum lipids. One hundred and twenty-six patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly assigned to receive either doxazosin (n = 63) or atenolol (n = 63). The mean final dosages, administered once daily, to obtain 24-hour blood pressure (BP) control were doxazosin 12 mg (range 1 to 16) and atenolol 91.8 mg (range 50 to 100). Of 12 doxazosin and 7 atenolol patient withdrawals from the study, 7 doxazosin and 4 atenolol patients withdrew for treatment-related reasons. No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found after 20 weeks in changes from baseline in standing and sitting BPs measured 24 hours after administration. Sitting BP (systolic/diastolic) was reduced by 10.5/9.8 mm Hg after doxazosin treatment and by 10.9/10.7 mm Hg after atenolol therapy. Standing BP was reduced by 8.8/7.7 mm Hg after doxazosin administration and 9.7/9.3 mm Hg after treatment with atenolol. Supine BP was measured in a small cohort of the study population, and doxazosin had a smaller effect than atenolol. After 20 weeks of treatment, both drugs reduced heart rate with atenolol producing a statistically significantly greater decrease than doxazosin (standing, doxazosin 5 beats/min, atenolol 16.2 beats/min, p less than 0.001; sitting, doxazosin 5 beats/min, atenolol 13.1 beats/min, p less than 0.001). Side effects were reported by 37 patients receiving doxazosin therapy and 34 patients receiving atenolol therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "Proatherogenic changes in serum lipid concentrations have been implicated as one of the major risk factors in the development of coronary artery disease. In a double-blind study, the new alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitor, doxazosin, was compared with atenolol for effects on the serum lipid profile. Ninety-six hypertensive patients were treated for up to 1 year with either doxazosin or atenolol once daily. There were statistically significant differences (p less than or equal to 0.01) between doxazosin and atenolol after 20 to 52 weeks of treatment in changes from baseline total triglyceride levels, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and HDL/total cholesterol ratio. The percentage of change from baseline and the statistical significance of the difference between treatment groups were: total triglycerides, doxazosin -5.9%, atenolol +32.4% (p = 0.01); HDL cholesterol, doxazosin +7.2%, atenolol -5.6% (p = 0.007) and HDL/total cholesterol ratio: doxazosin +8.7%, atenolol -6.2% (p = 0.006). All mean changes were in favor of doxazosin therapy. In addition, doxazosin treatment beneficially decreased total serum cholesterol levels (-1.6%) compared with atenolol (+0.6%), although not to a significant degree. The differences were maintained in the cohort of 67 patients treated for a full year. The favorable change exerted by doxazosin on the lipid profile suggests that it may have a beneficial influence on the lipid risk factor. These results, together with the sustained decrease in blood pressure achieved for up to 1 year of therapy, suggest that doxazosin may reduce the risk of coronary artery disease in susceptible patients.", 
    "13": "Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are 2 major risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Elevations of both blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels should be reduced to control CAD risk. Doxazosin is a once-daily, long-acting, selective alpha 1-adrenergic inhibitor that is effective for the treatment of essential hypertension. During controlled studies of doxazosin's antihypertensive efficacy, 3 serum lipid parameters were measured; total cholesterol, total triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In 10- to 12-week placebo-controlled studies, 142 doxazosin-treated patients were compared with 155 placebo-controlled subjects. Doxazosin patients had an increase of 8.9% in the HDL/total cholesterol ratio (p less than 0.05), whereas total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not significantly different between the 2 study groups. During a 52-week comparison of doxazosin versus atenolol, doxazosin treatment was associated with a significant decrease in total triglyceride levels (5%; p less than 0.001) and increases in HDL cholesterol levels (3.9%; p less than 0.01) and HDL/total cholesterol ratio (5.4%; p less than 0.0001). Doxazosin is an effective antihypertensive agent that has a favorable impact on serum lipid levels, thereby promoting a beneficial effect on 2 major CAD risk factors.", 
    "14": "In double-blind, controlled, parallel, comparative trials, the blood pressure-lowering effect of doxazosin was compared with that of placebo and other active agents. In 1 large, multicenter study, 903 patients were evaluated: 408 patients received doxazosin; 323, active comparative agents (nadolol, metoprolol, prazosin or hydrochlorothiazide); and 172, placebo. In another smaller study doxazosin was compared with terazosin treatment. Doxazosin administered as monotherapy lowered blood pressure significantly when compared with baseline and the placebo-treated group. Doxazosin therapy resulted in substantial reductions from baseline readings for systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both the standing and supine positions; the effect of doxazosin was similar to that of the comparative drugs; however, unlike beta blockers, no significant change in heart rate was demonstrated. The effectiveness and safety of doxazosin are practically identical in young and elderly patients, as well as in blacks and whites. Doxazosin exhibited a favorable lipid profile and the reported side effects of doxazosin were comparable to those observed with placebo and other study drugs. Another multicenter trial reported that doxazosin therapy was effective at low doses; 76% of those responders achieved controlled blood pressure at a mean dosage of 3.3 mg daily.", 
    "15": "Insulin stimulated the activity of a high-affinity GTPase activity in human platelet membranes some 62% over that of the basal activity. Half-maximal stimulation (Ka) was achieved with 3.1 nM insulin. The Km for GTP of the insulin-stimulated GTPase was 0.6 microM GTP. Treatment of isolated platelet membranes with cholera toxin, but not pertussis toxin, blocked insulin's ability to stimulate GTPase activity. Cholera toxin acted as a more potent inhibitor of the insulin-stimulated GTPase activity than that of the GTPase activity of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, Gs, as monitored by stimulation using prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). Mixed ligand experiments showed that insulin stimulated GTPase activity in an additive fashion to GTPase activity stimulated by PGE1, due to Gs; by adrenaline (+ propranolol), due to the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, G1 and by vasopressin, which stimulates the putative 'Gp', a G-protein suggested to control the stimulation of inositol phospholipid metabolism. Insulin thus appears to stimulate a novel high-affinity GTPase activity in human platelet membranes. This may reflect the functioning of the putative Gins, a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein which has been suggested to mediate certain of insulin's actions on target tissues.", 
    "16": "Imipramine was taken up by rat cerebellar neurons in primary culture. The process was dependent on time, temperature and pH and was reduced in the presence of the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or in the absence of glucose. Uptake approached saturation at 100 microM imipramine where approximately 42 nmol of the drug accumulated intracellularly per mg cell protein. Propranolol, but not serotonin, competed for imipramine uptake and uptake was inhibited by the 'lysosomotropic' amine chloroquine and by the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin, both of which dissipate proton gradients. Neurons were fractionated on Percoll gradients and the fractions exposed to [3H]imipramine. MgATP-dependent accumulation of [3H]imipramine was found mainly in fractions enriched for dense lysosomes. We conclude that imipramine was taken up by cerebellar neurons in primary culture and accumulated at high concentrations in intracellular compartments.", 
    "17": "A method is described that makes possible the rapid determination of the enantiomers of beta-blocking agents. After extraction from urine samples (at pH 9.9) using toluene, the enantiomers are derivatised with S-(+)-benoxaprofen chloride. The chromatographic separation can be performed on thin-layer plates with toluene-acetone as mobile phase. The derivatives can be detected by measuring the fluorescence (lambda ex = 313 nm,lambda em = 365 nm).", 
    "18": "Radioligand binding techniques are commonly used in the characterization of beta-adrenergic receptors on human peripheral leukocytes. Accurate interpretation of receptor binding parameters necessitates appropriate radioligand selection. In addition, cell isolation techniques should have minimal effect on the binding parameters of receptors. Our observation of curvilinear Scatchard plots with (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) resulted in a re-evaluation of this radioligand and the influence of cell isolation techniques on leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor binding parameters. Membranes from mononuclear (MN) and polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells isolated by a standard procedure (Ficoll-Hypaque) resulted in biphasic Scatchard plots with ICYP in three of four subjects. In contrast, linear Scatchard plots were observed for ICYP binding to membranes from MN and PMN cells isolated from the same four subjects with an alternative procedure utilizing plasma Percoll. Competition and saturation binding assays with ICYP identified a high degree of nonspecific binding. Decreased stereoselectivity with (-)- and (+)-propranolol was observed with membranes from Ficoll-Hypaque cells as compared to plasma Percoll cells. Kinetic analysis with ICYP demonstrated apparent irreversible binding whether displacement was initiated with a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist or agonist. These problems with ICYP prompted evaluation of an alternative radioligand, (-)-[125I]iodopindolol (IPIN); this radioligand demonstrated rapid and completely reversible binding, improved stereoselectivity, and low nonspecific binding. Using IPIN, Scatchard plots from three additional subjects were linear for both cell isolation procedures. Based on these observations, the preferred method of human leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptor analysis incorporates the plasma Percoll cell isolation technique and the radioligand IPIN.", 
    "19": "Effects of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on monkey, rabbit and dog internal carotid arteries were investigated. ANF caused a concentration-dependent relaxation in arterial strips submaximally precontracted with noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or high-potassium solution (10-30 mM). The response was greatest in the monkey arteries and least in the dog arteries. These results suggest that there is a marked species difference in the ANF-induced relaxation of the internal carotid arteries.", 
    "20": "Increased extracellular potassium concentrations ([K+]o) stimulated transient increases in glucose release and 45Ca2+ washout in the perfused rat liver. Stimulated glucose release had a K0.5 of about 26 mM for [K+]o, was not desensitized by successive infusion intervals of increased [K+]o, was not affected by altering the direction of perfusion, was absolutely dependent on the presence of [Ca2+]o, and was blocked by 2 mM cobalt or 10 microM verapamil. The increase in 45Ca2+ washout resulting from increased [K+]o also was blocked by 2 mM cobalt or 10 microM verapamil. Inhibitors of vascular tone (nitroprusside, atriopeptin II), arachidonic acid metabolism (indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid), and alpha- or beta-adrenergic or muscarinic nerve stimulation/secretion (phentolamine, propranolol, atropine) were unable to inhibit the [K+]o-stimulated glucose release. ATP, ADP, and AMP concentrations in tissue freeze-clamped 2 min after the onset of infusion of 50 mM K+ were not significantly different from control tissue. Glucose release from freshly isolated suspensions or primary cultured monolayers of hepatocytes or from liver slices, all of which responded to glucagon or phenylephrine, did not respond to increased [K+]o. The results indicate that glycogenolysis stimulated by depolarizing gradients of K+ is dependent on an intact perfused vasculature and may be mediated by potential-sensitive Ca2+ channels present in the vascular endothelium of the liver.", 
    "21": "The treatment of high blood pressure with beta-blocking and other antihypertensive agents has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of stroke, progression of hypertension, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, retinopathy and renal failure. Although hypertension increases the risk for developing coronary disease, the risk is heightened markedly if coexistent hyperlipidemia, smoking or glucose tolerance is present. Thiazide diuretics, primarily used as antihypertensive agents, compromise glucose tolerance and are associated with increases in plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and low density lipoprotein levels. Nonselective and beta 1-selective beta blockers have also been associated with increases in plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoproteins, as well as with decreases in high density lipoprotein levels. The effects of various antihypertensive agents on lipid levels, lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, left ventricular size and atherogenesis are discussed.", 
    "22": "Beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs are widely used as effective antihypertensive and antianginal agents, but treatment with these agents may be contraindicated in hypertensive patients in whom receptor blockade would interfere with noncardiovascular activities dependent on sympathetic drive. beta blockade impairs pulmonary function in asthmatic patients through antagonism of beta 2 bronchodilation. However, patients with chest problems may be treated effectively with beta 1-selective drugs, including acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol. The metabolic response to hypoglycemia, which is mediated by beta-receptor stimulation, involves insulin release, gluconeogenesis, tachycardia and increased systolic pressure. Beta 1-selective drugs are preferred in patients who need to increase blood glucose levels because they do not interfere with glycogenolysis. Hypertension induced by pregnancy may be treated with a beta blocker with no apparent adverse effects on the fetus or neonate. Those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may be preferable.", 
    "23": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents with various ancillary properties have been found valuable in the management of patients with hypertension, angina pectoris and atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. They are also used to reduce the risk of a subsequent coronary event after a myocardial infarction. In approximately 2 decades, the role of these agents in the patient with angina pectoris has expanded from one primarily involving the adjunctive treatment of the patient refractory to other drugs, to the present, in which beta-adrenergic blockers are the most common prophylactic agent prescribed for this indication.", 
    "24": "Almost all beta-adrenergic blockers, regardless of their pharmacologic characteristics, appear to have blood pressure-lowering activity in hypertensive patients. Comparisons between nonselective beta-blocking agents, such as propranolol and nadolol, with beta 1-selective drugs, such as metoprolol, atenolol and acebutolol, have demonstrated close similarities in their antihypertensive effects in patients. Similarly, beta blockers with and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) have comparable antihypertensive effects. However, beta-selective agents may offer some advantages over conventional beta blockers in hypertensive patients with concurrent conditions such as chronic obstructive airways disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Beta 1-selective drugs are also preferred in diabetic patients receiving hypoglycemic agents because they do not interfere with glycogenolysis. Agents lacking ISA, such as propranolol, acutely increase peripheral resistance. beta blockers with ISA usually lower resistance. ISA may also minimize the bradycardia frequently found in elderly patients. Agents with ISA may protect against the decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and the modest increase in triglycerides noted with some beta blockers that do not have ISA. Thus, in a large number of clinical situations in which hypertension is found, the properties of beta 1 selectivity and ISA allow beta blockers to be used with greater safety. Therefore, agents possessing both of these properties may be particularly valuable.", 
    "25": "The beta-adrenergic receptors from various species have been extensively studied both at the pharmacologic and the structural level. Clinical observations may now be interpreted on the basis of mechanisms of interactions between catecholamines and their membrane receptors, regulation of these receptors by guanyl nucleotide binding proteins and stimulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production by adenylate cyclase.", 
    "26": "Abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta-blocker therapy in patients with angina may be associated with unstable angina and myocardial infarction. It appears that an \"overshoot\" in heart rate from pretreatment values occurs, which increases myocardial oxygen demand. This increase in heart rate may be secondary to increased beta receptor numbers or increased receptor sensitivity. Another possible mechanism for the increased risk of myocardial infarction after beta-blocker withdrawal is increased platelet aggregability. Withdrawal reactions may be less severe with beta blockers that have partial agonist activity. In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, beta-blocker withdrawal reactions have also been observed. Maintenance of beta-blocker therapy on the morning of surgery appears to reduce this risk. Gradual withdrawal regimens in outpatients with angina may be associated with lower risk for a beta-blocker withdrawal reaction. The gradual withdrawal of beta blockers in hypertensive patients requires further study.", 
    "27": "Over 20 years ago, it was established that beta blockers could reduce high blood pressure. Currently, several beta blockers with different ancillary properties are available. They all have the property of blocking beta 1 receptors but differ from each other in a number of other respects: they may or may not block beta 2 receptors in low doses (beta 1 = receptor selectivity); they may or may not possess varying degrees of partial agonist activity, also known as intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA); they vary in the extent to which they are soluble in fat (lipophilicity). A review of relevant published findings indicates that the effects of beta blockers on cardiac output are not essential for their antihypertensive effect, nor is penetration of these drugs into the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Reduction in blood pressure during long-term beta blocker therapy is always associated with reduction of total peripheral resistance. Beta blockers with sufficient ISA to prevent cardio-depression, by exerting less negative inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, do not cause initial reflex vasoconstriction in response to cardiac beta blockade. Unlike beta blockers devoid of ISA, these agents ultimately reduce blood pressure by lowering the increased vascular resistance in hypertension to below pretreatment values. Recent beta blocker research has revealed a number of ways to manipulate the characteristically elevated vascular resistance in hypertension. Examples of these efforts are the combination of ISA, alpha 1 or alpha 2 receptor blockade and direct vasodilating properties in the enantiomers of a single beta blocker molecule. The practical significance of these developments remains to be established.", 
    "28": "The significance of ancillary properties of beta blockers continues to be the focus of considerable clinical investigation. Beta 1-selective blocking agents, such as acebutolol, inhibit cardiac beta 1 receptors, but have less influence on bronchial and vascular beta 2 receptors. Certain beta 1-selective blocking drugs, including acebutolol, have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), also termed partial agonist activity. This property produces slight cardiac stimulation, which can be blocked by propranolol. Drugs with mild or moderate ISA have proven to be as clinically effective as beta blockers lacking this property. Additionally, drugs with ISA possess potential therapeutic benefits, particularly for patients with coronary artery disease. The hemodynamic influences of cardioselectivity and ISA on left ventricular function, heart rate, cardiac output, left-sided heart filling pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with coronary artery disease are now clearly defined.", 
    "29": "The possession of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) by a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug results in a number of different pharmacologic properties. Most profound are the central hemodynamic effects. A drug with a significant degree of ISA results in less of a decrease in heart rate at rest and cardiac output, and, at least partly because of this, less of a decrease in peripheral blood flow. If prevailing sympathetic tone is low enough (e.g., during sleep) and the degree of ISA is sufficient, an increase in heart rate may be seen from an ISA-possessing drug. If the drug possesses beta 2 ISA, then a peripheral vasodilation action from stimulation of beta 2 vasodilator receptors may also be relevant. If high levels of exercise and full dosages of the drugs are used, a beta-blocking drug with ISA produces less of a decrease in heart rate. In asthmatic subjects, the modest beta-stimulant action on bronchial smooth muscle is not important, as these patients are potentially sensitive to any receptor blockade. Isoprenaline responses are inhibited to a similar degree compared with inhibition of exercise tachycardia, by nonselective drugs with and without ISA, whereas beta 1 selective agents produce much less inhibition of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. A drug with ISA \"down regulates\" beta receptors; thus, when the drug is withdrawn there is no post-beta-blocking drug hypersensitivity in contrast to agents without ISA. There is evidence that ISA results in less of a disturbance in certain metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism and the metabolism of liver-metabolized drugs.", 
    "30": "Beta 2 adrenoceptors have been subdivided into beta 1 and beta 2 receptors, both by the varying response of different tissues to sympathomimetic amines and, more recently, by radioligand-binding techniques. It would appear that beta 1 receptors occur predominantly in the heart, whereas beta 2 receptors are found in lungs, peripheral blood vessels and uterus, and are also involved with glycogenolysis and glucagon and insulin secretion. In addition, the distribution of beta 1 receptors appears to relate to the density of sympathetic innervation of an organ or tissue, but tissues without sympathetic innervation are found to contain beta 2 receptors. Thus, beta 1 adrenoceptors may be considered as physiologically innervated receptors mediating responses to neuronally released norepinephrine, and beta 2 receptors as mediating responses to circulating catecholamines, particularly epinephrine. Radioligand-binding studies have also shown that the heart contains beta 2 receptors and the lung beta 1 receptors, but these are in the minority, and their role has not been identified. For many years, cardioselective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonists have been available. This was considered to be a dose-dependent phenomenon but recent evidence has cast doubt on the concept that cardioselectivity is lost during dose increases within the therapeutic range. Nevertheless, even small doses of cardioselective drugs may show some beta 2-receptor antagonism, and may have adverse effects on patients with obstructive airways disease. Finally, nonselective drugs may result in a diastolic pressor effect in the presence of circulating catecholamines in contrast to the \"vascular sparing\" seen with cardioselective drugs.", 
    "31": "A new era in the management of high blood pressure is emerging. A number of drugs, acting by different mechanisms, are appropriate as individualized initial choices for treatment. The control of elevated blood pressure by single-drug therapy, if at all possible, will reduce the frequency of side effects and preserve a decent quality of life.", 
    "32": "The combination of a solid-phase extraction module, the AASP, on-line with thermospray high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for the automated determination of drugs in plasma is described. The technique was evaluated successfully using, as an example, the determination of labetalol in human plasma. [2H7]Labetalol was used as an internal standard to compensate for changes in ionization efficiencies between analyses. The chromatographic and mass spectrometric conditions were optimized for labetalol. The combined technique was demonstrated as being robust and reliable for the analysis of plasma samples from a clinical study.", 
    "33": "Changes in plasma concentrations of corticosterone and beta-endorphin (beta-END) were determined in male rats after treatment with the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or the non-selective 5-HT agonist 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine (MK-212). The administration of either 8-OH-DPAT or MK-212 increased plasma concentrations of both corticosterone and beta-END in a dose-related manner. The corticosterone and beta-END responses to 8-OH-DPAT were antagonized by spiperone and (-)-pindolol, both of which have been shown to have high affinity for the 5-HT1A binding site. In contrast, antagonist which are selective for the 5-HT2 receptor or non-selective 5-HT antagonists were without effect on the hormone responses to 8-OH-DPAT. The MK-212-induced increase in plasma concentrations of corticosterone and beta-END were not affected by treatment with the 5-HT1A antagonists spiperone and (-)-pindolol. However, the corticosterone and beta-END responses to MK-212 were attenuated by the selective 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin, ritanserin and altanserin, as well as by the non-selective 5-HT antagonist metergoline. It is concluded that stimulation of either 5-HT1A or 5-HT2 receptors results in an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the rat.", 
    "34": "The membrane-bound acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata was photolabeled by the noncompetitive channel blocker [3H]chlorpromazine under equilibrium conditions in the presence of the agonist carbamoylcholine. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into all subunits was reduced by addition of phencyclidine, a specific ligand for the high-affinity site for noncompetitive blockers. The labeled beta chain was purified and digested with trypsin or CNBr, and the resulting fragments were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Sequence analysis resulted in the identification of Ser-254 and Leu-257 as residues labeled by [3H]chlorpromazine in a phencyclidine-sensitive manner. These residues are located in the hydrophobic and potentially transmembrane segment M II of the beta chain, a region homologous to that containing the chlorpromazine-labeled Ser-262 in the delta chain [Giraudat, J., Dennis, M., Heidmann, T., Chang, J. Y., & Changeux, J.-P. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 83, 2719-2723]. These results show that homologous regions of different receptor subunits contribute to the unique high-affinity site for noncompetitive blockers, a finding consistent with the location of this site on the axis of symmetry of the receptor molecule.", 
    "35": "We have previously described a specific protease in turkey erythrocytes that converts the larger 50-kDa (P50) form of the beta 1-adrenoceptor to a smaller 40-kDa (P40) form [J\u00fcrss, R., Hekman, M., & Helmreich, E. J. M. (1985) Biochemistry 24, 3349-3354]. Further functional and structural characterization studies of the two forms are reported here. When purified P50 and P40 receptors were compared with respect to their relative capabilities to couple in lipid vesicles with pure stimulatory G-proteins (Gs-proteins) prepared from turkey erythrocytes or rabbit liver, a faster and larger activation of Gs-proteins was observed in response to l-isoproterenol and guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) with P40 than with P50 receptor. The kon values for P40 were 0.47 min-1 in the case of liver Gs and 0.22 min-1 in the case of erythrocyte Gs, whereas the corresponding values for P50 were 0.34 min-1 and 0.12 min-1, respectively. The binding properties of P50 and P40 forms of the receptor were not different, and desensitization of turkey erythrocytes on exposure to l-isoproterenol did not activate the protease. We furthermore ascertained that only the larger form with a molecular mass of 50 kDa carries the N-linked carbohydrates, which are removed on proteolytic conversion to the 40-kDa form and have either a triantennary or a tetraantennary nonfucosylated complex-type structure containing terminal sialyl residues.", 
    "36": "This investigation was conducted to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of single and multiple doses of conventional propranolol and long-acting propranolol in healthy human volunteers. Two double-blind, randomized, double-crossover, Latin square studies were carried out. One study evaluated long-acting propranolol 160 mg/d, conventional propranolol 40 mg qid, or placebo for seven days in 24 men. The other study compared long-acting propranolol 80 mg/d, conventional propranolol 20 mg qid, or placebo for seven days in 27 men. At specific times after the administration, blood samples were obtained, and heart rate and blood pressure were measured; exercise tests were done both on the first day and at steady state (day 7). In both studies, the area under the plasma propranolol concentration-time curve and the peak concentration were significantly less (P less than .0001) after the administration of long-acting propranolol compared with conventional propranolol on both day 1 and day 7; in addition, the elimination half-life was longer after administration of the long-acting preparation (9 hr) compared with that following the conventional dosage form (4 hr). Both conventional and long-acting propranolol significantly decreased the exercise heart rate at each of the selected time points (P less than .05) compared with placebo. Reduction in exercise heart rate was greater with conventional propranolol than with the long-acting formulation, but the differences were not statistically significant, when exercise was performed only at trough levels of the conventional drug. The decreases in exercise heart rate were correlated with plasma propranolol concentrations.", 
    "37": "The effects of the autonomic nervous system on muscle blood flow during and after contraction were studied. Autonomic blocking agent or stimulant was infused into the ear vein of rabbits. Muscle blood flow was measured by heated thermocouple technique on the quadriceps femoris stimulated by current of 5Hz, 6V and 0,1 msec duration. There was a statistically significant reduction of the postcontraction hyperemia after infusion of phentolamine methylate. Isoproterenol also caused significant reduction in post-contraction hyperemia. On the other hand, epinephrine, norepinephrine and propranolol had no effect on the muscle blood flow. These results suggest that most of the changes in muscle blood flow are not affected by the autonomic nervous system but that, the system may play in the hyperemic reaction of the skeletal muscle.", 
    "38": "In anesthetized dogs, it has already been shown that cibenzoline (4 mg/kg i.v.) possesses class 1 anti-arrhythmic properties. In this work, the cardiac electrophysiologic effects of cibenzoline (1 mg/kg i.v.) were studied before and after propranolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) treatment. Cibenzoline caused a slight tachycardia, a reduction of conduction velocity in the His-Purkinje system and in the ventricle, but no significant effects in the atria and the atrioventricular node were detected. On the contrary, when dogs were given the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol, cibenzoline produced major effects in the slow response structures, especially in the sinus node and the atrioventricular node (bradycardia and depression of the atrioventricular nodal conduction). No further effects were observed on the His-Purkinje system and ventricle as compared to administration of cibenzoline alone. In dogs, cibenzoline given i.v., had no effects on the slow response systems, probably because of sympathetic nervous system intervention since the class 4 effects of cibenzoline appeared after beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "39": "Administration of adenosine into mice induced a decrease in oxygen consumption (anticalorigenic effect), body temperature (hypothermal effect) and protected against acute hypoxia (antihypoxic action); all these effects are closely correlated. Isopropyl noradrenaline and theophylline prevented but propranolol and dipiridamol increased these effects of adenosine. Being administered into mice adenosine decreased both cAMP content (in skeletal muscles and kidney) and respiration in kidney homogenates. These adenosine effects appear to be realized via the following chain: A1-receptors----decrease in cellular cAMP content----inhibition of tissue oxygen consumption----development of anticalorigenic reactions----hypothermal effects----antihypoxic actions.", 
    "40": "Twenty-one patients on long-term treatment with topical timolol maleate and dipivefrin hydrochloride were studied to assess the effect of each agent when used in combined therapy. The two agents are partially additive in most patients, but the relative contribution of each agent varies widely in individual patients and in separate diagnostic categories.", 
    "41": "A 1% forskolin (nonproprietary name, colforsin) suspension was instilled in one eye each of 15 normal human subjects in a single-dose experiment under the following three conditions: during the day, during the night while asleep, and following pretreatment with timolol maleate. The rate of flow was 2.6 +/- 0.13 microL/min (mean +/- SE) in the afternoon in both the treated and the untreated eyes. During sleep at night the flow was lower than in the afternoon in both the placebo-treated eye, 1.5 +/- 0.09 microL/min, and the forskolin-treated eye, 1.3 +/- 0.09 microL/min. Timolol pretreatment reduced the flow to 1.6 +/- 0.08 microL/min in the placebo-treated eye and 1.6 +/- 0.10 microL/min in the forskolin-treated eye. No statistically significant effects of forskolin on flow were observed under any of the conditions. Forskolin caused transient hyperemia in all subjects. The experiment confirmed previous reports of differences in the rate of aqueous flow at different times of day and the effect of the beta-adrenergic blocker timolol on the rate of aqueous humor flow.", 
    "42": "To assess the contribution of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to beat-to-beat (R-R interval) variations in the squirrel monkey, heart rate was analyzed after atropine, propranolol, carbachol, or isoproterenol administration, using a computer analyzing system. Heart rate variations were expressed as coefficient of variance (CV) of mean R-R interval. CV of R-R interval clearly was reduced by atropine but not by propranolol, indicating that the effect could be mediated through the parasympathetic nerve. CV of R-R interval was measured also under vestibulo-visual conflict (VVC) situation in pitch. Although CV of R-R interval increased during VVC, this variation almost was abolished after atropine administration. Monkeys with unilateral labyrinthectomy showed smaller variations than those without operation during exposure to VVC. CV of R-R interval is a useful parameter for the objective and quantitative evaluation of ANS function and may be a good indicator to demonstrate the severity of motion sickness without invasive methods.", 
    "43": "In acute experiments on rats different agents and their combinations were used to induced hypoxia. In order to estimate the oxygen status of crus bone marrow by taking measurements in subcutaneous fat by a standard electrode with small working surface several electrodes should be used simultaneously. A correlation between subcutaneous and bone-marrow hypoxic tension caused by the hypoxia-induced agents was associated with the subcutaneous fat zone under study. However, in any case, a pronounced pO2 decrease in bone marrow might occur upon slight hypoxic tension.", 
    "44": "Peculiarities of propranolol pharmacokinetics in patients with acute myocardial infarction were determined after oral administration of 80 mg of the drug and compared with control group of patients with stage II hypertensive disease: a significant increase of Cmax, Tmax and AUC without changes of kel and T1/2. A direct linear correlation (r = 0.86, p = 0.02) and inverse linear correlation (r = -0.54, p = 0.1) with the duration of the disease were revealed.", 
    "45": "The immunosuppressive effect of anaprilin on humoral and cellular responses was established during experiments on mice. The influence of the drug on the phenomenon of hypersensitivity of delayed type begins to be revealed at the lower dose of the drug (0.5 mg/kg) as compared with the inhibitory action of the beta-adrenoblocker on antibody formation (1 mg/kg).", 
    "46": "A young woman had been on antiarrhythmic treatment with sotalol 80-160 mg daily for three years because of ventricular tachycardia. After a quarrel she ingested an overdose of sotalol, estimated to be 13-14 g, and was immediately brought to hospital, where the first ECG was taken 25 minutes after the ingestion. The clinical course, including the relationship over time between pronounced bradycardia, QT prolongation and malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias is described. Serum concentrations were obtained regularly between 11 and 54 hours after the ingestion. After initially very high levels, the concentrations decreased in a strictly exponential manner to arrive at therapeutic concentrations 39 hours after the ingestion. Calculations revealed that over 12 g of sotalol was absorbed into the circulation, while the half life was 9.2 h and the oral clearance 294 mg min-1. The heart rate normalized about 24 hours after the repolarization variables, which supports the opinion that the class III action of sotalol is unrelated to the beta-blockade. In sotalol intoxication, malignant tachyarrhythmias appearing during excessive prolongation of the QT interval, most often in combination with hypokalemia, ethanol intoxication or concomitant antiarrhythmic treatment, may need emergency defibrillation but seem to disappear within a few hours. Thus, while massive sotalol intoxication may be fatal, early treatment promotes a successful outcome even when very high doses have been ingested.", 
    "47": "The response of heart rate to acute 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCE) inhalation and its mechanism via the autonomic nervous system were studied in anesthetized dogs in acute inhalation experiments. Concentrations of 1,1,1-TCE in inspired air of 1.32 +/- 0.14% (mean +/- S.E.) increased heart rate, but 2.79 +/- 0.24% decreased heart rate. Opposite reactions of heart rate were observed when blood pressure decreased to 70-80 mm Hg following inhalation. Moreover, both tachycardia from relatively low concentrations and bradycardia from higher concentrations were blocked by pre-administration of adrenergic beta blocker, but were only slightly affected by vagotomy. It is suggested that both tachycardia and bradycardia following 1,1,1-TCE inhalation may be controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "48": "In contrast to the strong stimulation of testosterone production by hCG, L-isoproterenol had little effect on freshly isolated Leydig cells from 18-day-old mouse fetuses. However, the ability of fetal Leydig cells to respond to L-isoproterenol exposure increased during culture (0-24 h). The response of the cultured cells to L-isoproterenol was dose-dependent with an ED50 at 2 X 10(-7) M. Adrenaline and noradrenaline at a concentration of 10(-5) M also increased testosterone production by cultured fetal Leydig cells. DL-Propranolol, a beta-antagonist, inhibited L-isoproterenol-stimulated testosterone production in a dose-dependent manner, while phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, had no effect. These results suggest that catecholamines may play an essential role in the control of testicular steroidogenesis during fetal development.", 
    "49": "Electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic and mid-brain defence area of the rat's brain elicits a consistent cardiovascular pattern of response of which vasodilatation in the skeletal muscle is an integral component: the mechanisms mediating this vasodilatation were investigated. It is not sensitive to atropine in this species, but it was substantially affected, particularly its later stage (the prolonged tail-end of the response), by either beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (propranolol, sotalol) or bilateral adrenalectomy. A major part of the hind-limb vasodilatation can therefore be attributed to the action of catecholamines released from the adrenal glands. The initial part of the vasodilatation, which still remained after beta-adrenoreceptor blockade and adrenalectomy, was abolished by intravenous injection of guanethidine and phentolamine and seems therefore due simply to withdrawal of vasoconstrictor tone. In confirmation, stimulation of the sympathetic outflow to the hind-quarters after phentolamine and guanethidine had been used to block vasoconstriction did not reveal a sympathetic vasodilator nerve supply to the hind-limb vasculature.", 
    "50": "We report a case of Acute Intermittent Porphyria which presented with acute abdominal distress, autonomic dysfunction and laboratory abnormalities. The treatment is discussed with special emphasis on the effect of large doses of Propranolol.", 
    "51": "We examined the importance of decreased heart rate in the beneficial effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on exercise-induced regional myocardial ischemia and contractile dysfunction in conscious dogs with single vessel coronary stenosis (ameroid constrictor). Studies were performed during control treadmill exercise, which produced regional myocardial ischemia (blood flow measured with microspheres) and wall dysfunction (measured using sonomicrometers). A second run was performed after the administration of atenolol (0.3-1.0 mg/kg i.v.), and the reduced heart rate caused by atenolol during early steady-state running was then prevented by atrial pacing during the latter portion of the run. Atenolol reduced the exercise heart rate from 217 +/- 25 beats per minute (SD, n = 9) to 166 +/- 15, and ischemic zone wall thickening during systole improved from 27 +/- 22% of the resting value in the control run to 50 +/- 25% of the resting value in the atenolol run (p less than 0.01). Atrial pacing then increased heart rate to 217 +/- 23 beats per minute, and regional wall thickening deteriorated to 15 +/- 25% of the resting value. Regional subendocardial blood flow in the ischemic zone during atrial pacing with atenolol was slightly less than that observed in the control run, in both ischemic and control zones, indicating no remaining beneficial effect of atenolol when heart rate reduction was eliminated. We conclude that the only significant mechanism for the improvement in exercise-induced ischemia and wall motion produced by atenolol is a reduction in the exercise heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The effects of calcium entry blockers on stimulated cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition in cultured macrophages were characterized in order to elucidate mechanisms underlying possible antiatherosclerotic effects. Stimulation of intracellular cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition was initiated by incubation of macrophages with beta-very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL). Nifedipine (Class I) markedly reduced cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition at all concentrations tested. However, Bay K 8644, a dihydropyridine which is known to stimulate calcium entry, also reduced cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition with a similar potency to nifedipine. The effects of three Class II calcium entry blockers were evaluated: verapamil, methoxyverapamil, and diltiazem. Verapamil inhibited cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, methoxyverapamil reduced cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition in a concentration-dependent manner although the reduction was not as great as that produced by verapamil. In contrast, diltiazem at any concentration tested did not inhibit cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition. Flunarizine (a Class III calcium entry blocker) produced a modest stimulation of cholesteryl [3H]-oleate deposition at the lowest concentration used (10(-7)M) but marked depression at the highest concentration (10(-5)M). The results indicate calcium entry blockers may exert protective effects on the development of atherosclerosis in animal models of diet-induced hyperlipidaemia by inhibiting intracellular cholesteryl ester deposition, but this effect may not be related to their calcium entry-blocking effects.", 
    "53": "Beta-Adrenoceptor blocker therapy is known to cause disturbances of the lipoprotein profile. The long-term effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and the influence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) has not been clearly defined. We measured serum lipoproteins during chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade in patients with stable angina pectoris treated with propranolol (without ISA) (n = 21) or pindolol (with ISA) (n = 19). No significant changes occurred in the lipoprotein profile of the patients taking pindolol. In those taking propranolol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) increased at 52 weeks (P less than 0.05) and total high density lipoprotein (HDL) decreased at 26 weeks (P less than 0.01) and at 52 weeks (P less than 0.05). However, HDL2 rose significantly at 52 weeks (P less than 0.05). There was a corresponding increase in HDL2/HDL3 ratio. We conclude that pindolol is less likely to exert a harmful effect on plasma lipoproteins than beta-adrenoceptor blockers without ISA.", 
    "54": "The comparative efficacy of propranolol and amitriptyline in the prophylaxis of migraine headache was studied in 30 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Headache response to medication was measured monthly by compilation of headache scores derived from quantitative data recorded by patients in a daily diary; at each visit, Zung and Hamilton tests for depression and the Spielberger state test for anxiety were performed. In the absence of clinical toxicity at monthly visits, the decision to maintain the current dose or raise it was made by a computer, which compared current headache score with that of the previous month. Both drugs were superior to placebo. Neither drug was superior to the other. The effectiveness of neither drug correlated with a decrease in anxiety or depression demonstrated by psychological testing.", 
    "55": "We compared transient slope of end-systolic pressure-volume line (T-Emax) with steady Emax (S-Emax) in isolated cross-circulated canine left ventricles. T-Emax is the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume line (ESPVL) determined from the last steady-state ejecting contraction (SEC) and the first transient isovolumic contraction produced by end-diastolic volume clamp. S-Emax is the slope of ESPVL determined from five steady-state contractions by linear regression analysis. We obtained three T-Emax values in the same contractile state by changing ejection fraction (EF) of SEC to three levels (range 14-58%) from the same end-diastolic volume. T-Emax variably increased with EF in any contractile state. The ratios of the three T-Emax values to the same S-Emax value was 1.08 +/- 0.04 (11 ventricles, means +/- SE) for high EF, 0.87 +/- 0.06 for middle EF, and 0.69 +/- 0.07 for low EF in control contractile state. These ratios decreased under epinephrine and increased under propranolol. We conclude that T-Emax depends not only on EF but also on contractile state in isolated dog left ventricles.", 
    "56": "Umbilical cord length may be a function of fetal movement. Agents that cause decreased fetal movement may cause short umbilical cords. This investigation examined the effect of the beta-blocker atenolol on umbilical cord length in rabbits. Fetuses of rabbits treated with atenolol had significantly shorter cords than control animals (p less than or equal to 0.0005). Since short cords are associated with problems in labor, low Apgar scores, and abruption, we recommend careful surveillance of mothers and fetuses who are given beta-blocking agents in the first 30 weeks of pregnancy.", 
    "57": "The effect of i.c.v. administration of histamine (HA) on the plasma glucose level was examined in mice. HA (0.09-180 nmol) increased dose-dependently the plasma glucose level, 30 min after the injection. Even a low dose of 0.45 nmol produced a significant effect. The pretreatment with metoprine, an inhibitor of HA-N-methyltransferase, heightened the peak of the hyperglycemic response markedly and prolonged the duration. Systemic administration of the H1-receptor antagonists mepyramine (0.5-2 mg/kg), chlorpheniramine (1-4 mg/kg) and promethazine (1-4 mg/kg), inhibited dose-dependently the HA-induced hyperglycemia, whereas an H2-receptor antagonist, cimetidine (80 nmol i.c.v.), was without effect. The hyperglycemic response to HA disappeared in bilaterally adrenalectomized mice. Although the treatment of mice with metyrapone reduced the plasma corticosterone level to less than 15% of the control value, the hyperglycemic response to HA was still observed. After the administration of HA, there was a significant elevation of plasma norepinephrine levels. Increase in the plasma epinephrine was more marked than the norepinephrine response. Pretreatment with phentolamine (5 mg/kg i.p.) but not propranolol (15 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the HA-induced hyperglycemia by about 50% and the combination of same doses of phentolamine and propranolol blocked the response completely. These results suggest that the central hyperglycemic effect of HA is produced mainly by an increase in the sympathetic outflow, followed by an increase in catecholamine secretion from the adrenal medulla. It is likely that the stimulation of H1, but not H2, receptors in the brain is involved in this response.", 
    "58": "The effects of single oral labetalol doses (100, 200, and 400 mg) on forearm and hepatic circulations were studied over a 2-hour period in 27 normotensive human subjects by using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Labetalol administration resulted in a dose-dependent beta-receptor blockade as determined by an isoproterenol sensitivity test. It also produced a dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial blood pressure that was of greater duration at larger doses. At the lowest dose labetalol produced a transient decrease in arterial pressure followed by a decrease in forearm blood flow and increase in forearm vascular resistance. As the dose of labetalol increased, the hypotensive response became more prolonged, but the changes in forearm blood flow and vascular resistance no longer occurred. Heart rate did not change significantly after any of these doses. Hepatic blood flow also did not change significantly after labetalol. Our results suggest that the increase in forearm vascular resistance after the lowest dose of labetalol probably was caused by unopposed alpha-receptor activation because the agent had a relatively greater beta-receptor blocking action at the low doses, but as the dose increased the alpha-receptor blocking action of the drug became more pronounced and abolished the vasoconstrictor effect in the forearm. Furthermore, our study indicates that despite the significant drop in arterial pressure at doses greater than 100 mg, blood flow is well maintained to the skeletal muscle and splanchnic circulations during labetalol therapy.", 
    "59": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the cold pressor test on sympathetic outflow with direct measurements of nerve traffic in conscious humans and to test the strength of correlation between sympathetic nerve discharge and the changes in arterial pressure, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine. In 25 healthy subjects, arterial pressure, heart rate, and muscle sympathetic nerve activity were measured with microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into a peroneal muscle nerve fascicle in the leg during immersion of the hand in ice water for 2 minutes. Arterial pressure rose steadily during the first and second minutes of the cold pressor test. Muscle sympathetic activity (burst frequency X amplitude) did not increase in the first 30 seconds of the test but increased from 230 +/- 27 to 386 +/- 52 units (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.05) by the end of the first minute of the test and to 574 +/- 73 (p less than 0.01) during the second minute. In contrast, heart rate increased maximally during the first 30 seconds of the cold pressor test and returned to control during the second minute. The increases in heart rate were abolished by beta-adrenergic blockade. The increases in muscle sympathetic activity during the cold pressor test were correlated with the increases in both mean arterial pressure (r = 0.86, p less than 0.01) and peripheral venous norepinephrine (r = 0.72, p less than 0.05); however, large changes in nerve traffic were associated with small changes in plasma norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "We evaluated the effects of intravenous and long-term oral sotalol treatment in 17 patients with an accessory atrioventricular (AV) pathway. All patients had a history of symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia. During electrophysiologic study intravenous (1.5 mg/kg body weight) and oral (240 to 320 mg/day) sotalol caused significant increases of sinus cycle length, AV nodal conduction time, and refractory periods of atrial and ventricular myocardium and accessory pathway. AV reciprocating tachycardia, which was inducible and sustained in 15 patients at control, was still inducible after intravenous sotalol in 14 patients, including one in whom it was not inducible at control. However, tachycardia became nonsustained in 10 patients. In seven patients who underwent repeat drug testing while on oral sotalol, results were the same as after intravenous sotalol. Sixteen patients were followed-up for 36 months (median value). Fifteen of them were clinically free of symptoms or experienced marked improvement, despite recurrences of tachycardia in two. In a third patient sotalol had to be withdrawn because of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia. Orthostatic hypotension occurred in five patients and required withdrawal of sotalol in one. To predict the long-term clinical outcome of patients, exercise testing and Holter monitoring were of little or no value. Programmed electrical stimulation predicted clinical outcome in 63% after intravenous and in 86% after oral sotalol. This study shows that long-term treatment with sotalol is highly effective in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and regular supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "61": "The effects of the nonselective beta blocker, propranolol, on coarctectomy-induced hypertension were evaluated relative to changes in cardiac function, sympathetic tone, and plasma renin activity (PRA). A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, age-stratified design was employed. Propranolol (n = 11, mean age 9.4 years) or placebo (n = 12, mean age 10.2 years) was started 2 days before surgery and continued until 6 days after surgery. In patients on placebo, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index increased rapidly and peaked within 1 day after surgery. Over the ensuing days these increases gradually abated. Plasma epinephrine and PRA increased markedly within 12 hours after surgery, but returned quickly toward preoperative levels. In contrast, plasma norepinephrine increased more gradually and remained elevated longer. In patients on propranolol, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index and PRA showed only negligible increases. However, diastolic blood pressure, increased even faster with propranolol than with placebo but to the same extent. Plasma catecholamines showed similar increases on the two treatments. Only in the placebo group was the code broken in the intensive care unit because of hypertension uncontrolled by sodium nitroprusside; this occurred in 6 of 12 patients. We conclude that nonselective beta blockade ameliorates the hyperdynamic circulation and increase in systolic blood pressure following coarctectomy. The initial increase in diastolic blood pressure following surgery in the propranolol group may have been caused by vascular beta-2-receptor blockade resulting in unopposed alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "62": "The longitudinal muscle of the guinea pig ileum is well known to contract in response to stimulation of either muscarinic or histamine H1 receptors. However, we found that simultaneous application of agonists to both receptors, methacholine (MeCh) and histamine (Hist), at their maximum concentrations (both at 10(-5) M), induced a contraction of the muscle with a pattern very similar to that observed with MeCh alone. In the muscle contracted by MeCh, a muscarinic antagonist, atropine, caused a transient relaxation, but a histamine H1 blocker, pyrilamine, had no effect on the tension. Experiments using pirenzepine indicated that muscarinic-M1 receptors did not seem to be involved in the mechanism of this phenomenon. The atropine-induced relaxation was not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M) or tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M). After pretreatment of the muscle with 10(-5) M MeCh for 10 min, the contractile effect of 10(-5) M Hist was suppressed intensely for a certain time period, but that of 10(-5) M MeCh was not diminished. On the other hand, pretreatment of the muscle with 10(-5) M Hist for 10 min did not influence the contraction by either MeCh or Hist. The suppression by MeCh of the Hist action developed dependently on the concentration of MeCh and the time length of exposure to MeCh, and the persistence was temperature-dependent. Furthermore, this suppression was not surmounted by the elevation of Hist concentration. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the muscle which was immersed in the nutrient solution without CaCl2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Heavy diffuse bleeding from congested gastric mucosa (congestive gastropathy) was treated by propranolol (dose = 24 to 480 mg per day) in 14 consecutive patients with portal hypertension. Thirteen patients (93%) stopped bleeding within 3 days. Gastric mucosal cherry red spots (a sign of severe gastropathy) were unchanged in 5 patients, became less obvious in 4 and appearances returned to normal in 5. Propranolol was discontinued electively in seven patients after 2 to 6 months; four of these patients rebled from the same lesion and stopped bleeding when propranolol was recommenced. No patient has rebled from congestive gastropathy while receiving propranolol during follow-up of 12 to 42 (median = 23) months. A further 24 patients with nonbleeding congestive gastropathy received 160 mg long-acting propranolol per day in a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over trial. Twenty-two patients completed the study; in nine patients, endoscopic grading of congestive gastropathy improved after propranolol compared to three after placebo (p less than 0.05). Although the mechanism of action is not understood, propranolol appears to have a clinically significant role in the management of nonvariceal gastric bleeding in portal hypertension.", 
    "64": "In a single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study the effects of verapamil (450 +/- 30 mg/day) and propranolol (160 +/- 20 mg/day) on endurance time during submaximal exercise were compared in eight patients with essential hypertension. The drugs were given in randomized order. Each active drug period was preceded by a placebo phase. Endurance tests were performed during both placebo periods and treatment with verapamil and propranolol by bicycle ergometry. Both drugs were equally effective in decreasing resting blood pressure. Verapamil and propranolol reduced exercise heart rate, the effect of propranolol being more pronounced. With placebo, endurance time during exercise was 57 +/- 11 minutes; with propranolol it was 32 +/- 7 minutes (P less than 0.05). Verapamil had no influence on endurance time. The study demonstrates that in contrast to propranolol, verapamil has no influence on exercise tolerance during submaximal work in patients with hypertension.", 
    "65": "Possible mutual additivity of the stimulating effects of fatty acids and alpha-adrenergic agents on gluconeogenesis was examined using isolated rat liver cells. Adrenaline or noradrenaline alone stimulated gluconeogenesis from lactate by 34% both in the absence and presence of propranolol. Oleate or acetate alone stimulated gluconeogenesis by 76% and 45%, respectively; propranolol did not influence the effects. Simultaneous administration of alpha-adrenergic agents with oleate or acetate increased gluconeogenesis by 110% and 90-100%, respectively, thus documenting mutual additivity of hormonal and non-hormonal stimulation; propranolol did not affect the mutual additivity of the effects observed.", 
    "66": "1. The development of post-exercise ketosis is not abolished by the ingestion of glucose immediately after exercise, despite inducing high insulin/glucagon ratios in the peripheral (and therefore by implication in the portal) blood. 2. To investigate the possibility of autonomic control of the liver influencing its sensitivity to the major counter-regulatory hormones, we administered 50 g glucose, either on its own, or together with 0.5 mg prazosine, 40 mg propranolol, or 15 mg propantheline, to forty-seven 48 h carbohydrate-starved athletes who had just run 25 km. 3. The blood 3-hydroxybutyrate concentration rose from 0.30 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- S.E. of mean) to 0.52 +/- 0.08 mmol/l with exercise, and then to 1.32 +/- 0.40 mmol/l at 6 h after exercise in subjects who had ingested only glucose after exercise. 4. The effects of prazosine and propantheline on the blood ketone body concentration at 2 h after exercise was not statistically significant. Propranolol, on the other hand, significantly lowered the blood 3-hydroxybutyrate concentration (compared with controls) to 0.09 +/- 0.03 mmol/l at 3 h (P less than 0.01), and 0.35 +/- 0.08 mmol/l at 6 h (P less than 0.01) after exercise. 5. The plasma insulin, glucagon, glucose and free fatty acid concentrations were unaffected by propranolol, indicating that the antiketogenesis was the result of a direct effect on ketone body metabolism. 6. Since beta-adrenergic blockade has not previously been shown to have antiketogenic activity, except in somatostatin-induced hyperketonaemia, it is concluded that its effectiveness in post-exercise ketosis can probably be ascribed to a functional hepatic insulin and glucagon deficiency.", 
    "67": "Nineteen elderly hypertensive patients already being treated with a diuretic and, where necessary, another anti-hypertensive agent, were studied in a double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison of conventional propranolol, 40 mg three times daily, with a long-acting propranolol formulation, 160 mg once daily, as a second line agent. Patients were assessed before taking the morning's allocated medication. This was done as near as possible to 24 h after the last dose of once daily propranolol and as near as possible to 15 h after the last dose of three times daily conventional propranolol. Assessment was carried out at the time of randomization and after 4 weeks' treatment with both propranolol formulations. Heart rate and blood pressures were measured in the supine and standing positions and after exercise. Both propranolol formulations were effective as second line agents in these elderly patients and both were well tolerated. Patient compliance on both propranolol formulations was very good although the long-acting formulation may be of value in improving this still further.", 
    "68": "The effect of treatment with a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker (propranolol) and an acetylcholinesterase blocker (neostigmine) on the duration of postoperative ileus after cholecystectomy was investigated in a double-blind, randomized study comprising 51 patients. Propranolol (P), 10 mg intravenously twice daily was, together with neostigmine (N), 0.5 mg subcutaneously twice daily, administered to 16 patients. Eighteen patients were treated with neostigmine, 0.5 mg subcutaneously twice daily only, and 17 patients were placebo-treated controls (C). The medical treatment started in the evening of the day of operation. The time to first passage of stool after operation was determined and used as a measure of duration of the postoperative ileus. The mean time was 68 +/- 6 h in the P + N-treated group, 82 +/- 6 h in the N group, and 90 +/- 7 h in the C group. The difference between the P + N group and controls was significant (p less than 0.01). P + N was effective in patients older than 60 years (p less than 0.01), whereas no effect was seen in patients younger than 60 years. In conclusion, treatment with a combination of propranolol and neostigmine shortened the duration of postoperative paralytic ileus after cholecystectomy. This effect was not seen after treatment with neostigmine only. The effect of P + N was most marked in patients older than 60 years.", 
    "69": "The mechanisms of the cardiovascular and renin responses to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are unclear. Rabbit studies suggest that VIP-induced tachycardia is largely beta-adrenoceptor mediated, but that the renin response may be partially prostaglandin-dependent. To examine the relative importance of prostaglandins and reflex sympathetic activation in the haemodynamic and renin responses to VIP infusion in man, we completed two randomised single-blind crossover studies in two groups of six healthy male volunteers (aged 24-35 years). We recorded the effects of indomethacin and propranolol pretreatment on VIP-related changes in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), forearm vascular resistance (FVR), plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma noradrenaline (PNA) and plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations. Intravenous VIP (calculated dose: 6 pmol kg-1 min-1) produced cutaneous flushing, increased HR and PRA, decreased FVR, but did not alter mean arterial BP or AVP levels. Indomethacin (375 mg over 3 days) lowered basal PRA and propranolol (circa 40 mg i.v. over 60 min) decreased resting HR and increased FVR. Although indomethacin and propranolol reduced the absolute rise in PRA and HR, respectively, during VIP infusion, the percentage changes were no different from control. Neither drug altered the flush response to VIP and propranolol did not affect the fall in FVR. We conclude that the measured cardiovascular responses to VIP infusion in man are probably direct and do not involve a significant contribution from reflex sympathetic stimulation, nor prostaglandin release.", 
    "70": "Calcium antagonists lead to a relaxation of smooth vascular muscles and exert a cardiodepressive effect. They make up a heterogeneous group, with primarily substances of the nifedipine and verapamil type playing the most important role in the treatment of cardiocirculatory diseases. The principal indications include coronary heart disease and hypertension. During physical exercise, following the administration of calcium antagonists, VO2max and endurance performance are not impaired. The rate of perceived exertion does not increase to any greater extent in comparison with placebo. Nifedipine leads to an increase of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) as an expression of a reflex activation of the sympathetic system and to a slight increase in heart rate, while calcium antagonists of the verapamil type lower heart rate by 10 to 15 beats/min during physical exercise as a result of their intrinsic negative chronotropic effect. Cardiac output, in spite of the drop in heart rate, remains unchanged. Neither carbohydrate metabolism nor lipid metabolism, including lipolysis, which provide the essential energy-yielding substrates during exercise, are affected by calcium antagonists. Potassium likewise remains unchanged. The response of the hormones insulin, growth hormone and cortisol is the same with calcium antagonists both during incremental graded exercise and during prolonged exercise as with placebo. In comparison with the administration of only calcium antagonists, the combination of calcium antagonists and beta-blockers impairs physical performance. The diminishment in performance, however, is markedly less pronounced than with beta-blocker monotherapy. Unimpaired performance is crucial for physically active patients. Especially for patients performing regular physical activity who suffer from mild hypertension, calcium antagonists provide a viable therapeutic alternative to beta-blockers.", 
    "71": "Solute and water uptake were studied in isolated perfused rat lungs with airspaces filled with the perfusion fluid. The albumin in this solution was labelled with Evans blue (T-1824), and uptake of fluid from the airspaces was documented by an increase in T-1824 concentration in airway fluid of 6.5 +/- 1.6% (n = 5, SEM) at 1 hour and 12.2 +/- 0.9% (n = 10) at 2 hours. The only detectable osmotic force that could have contributed to a loss of fluid from the alveolar fluid was a decrease in airspace glucose concentrations, which fell much more rapidly (from 150 mg/dl to 58.7 +/- 7.1 mg/dl, n = 10, after 2 hours) than plasma glucose (from 150 mg/dl to 128.9 +/- 3.7 mg/dl). Addition of 5 X 10(-5) M terbutaline to the perfusate and airspace solutions nearly doubled fluid reabsorption at 1 hour, an effect that was inhibited by propranolol and did not appear to be related to glucose consumption. Exposure to terbutaline for 2 hours increased epithelial permeability to 3H-mannitol and 22Na+. These observations suggest that active sodium transport and epithelial metabolism or transport of glucose in airway fluid may each play a role in the reabsorption of edema fluid.", 
    "72": "The long-term effect of medical vs surgical therapy on quality of life was evaluated by New York Heart Association functional classification, severity of angina and exercise performance in 427 surviving patients with stable angina at 10 years. Surgically assigned patients had significantly more improvement in functional classification, relief of angina and exercise performance at 1 and 5 years than medically assigned patients. Relative to entry, functional classification was improved in 65% of surgically treated patients at 1 year and in 51% at 5 years, compared with 45% and 40%, respectively, of medically treated patients. Marked improvement in angina was observed in 49% of surgical patients at 1 year and in 41% at 5 years, vs 12% and 17%, respectively, in medical patients. At 10 years, quality of life was not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups: 52% of surgical patients had an improved functional classification, compared with 46% of medical patients, while 33% of surgical and 37% of medical patients had a marked improvement in angina. Exclusion of medical and surgical nonadherers had little effect on the 1- and 5-year comparisons. The 10-year treatment differences, however, were accentuated when 123 medically assigned patients who later underwent operation and who benefited from it were excluded from the analysis. In surgical patients, a strong association was observed between graft patency and functional class at 1 year, but not at 5 and 10 years. In general, patients with some or all grafts open had more improvement in functional classification than patients with all grafts closed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "The effects of a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist (FG 7142) on gastric ulcer formation were studied in restrained rats. FG 7142 (10-50 mg/kg) reduced in a dose-dependent fashion both the number and cumulative length of gastric ulcers elicited by restraint for 2 hr at 4 degrees C, but did not affect ulcer formation in unrestrained animals maintained in this environment. FG 7142 also reduced gastric ulcer formation in restrained rats maintained at 22 degrees C for 5 hr. The ability of FG 7142 to reduce restraint-stress induced gastric ulcer formation was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93426 and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. These findings suggest that FG 7142 produces a benzodiazepine-receptor mediated reduction in gastric ulcer formation, which may result from its ability to increase activity of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "74": "In mice, reserpine-induced hypothermia is partly antagonized by clenbuterol, a beta-adrenergic agonist specific for beta 2 receptors, and completely antagonized by dobutamine, a beta-adrenergic agonist specific for beta 1 receptors. In addition, the effects of dobutamine and of clenbuterol are impaired by betaxolol (1 and 4 mg/kg) and unchanged by ICI 118,551 (1 and 4 mg/kg) beta-blocking drugs respectively selective for beta 1 and beta 2 receptors. These results indicate that reserpine-induced hypothermia depends on the beta 1 receptors and lend support to an indirect effect of clenbuterol. After a chronic treatment, clenbuterol-induced antagonism of reserpine hypothermia is facilitated. This facilitation is impaired by ICI 118,551 and by betaxolol but, in this last case, with high doses only. So the facilitation involves beta 2 adrenergic receptors and implies an increase in the sensitivity of beta 1 receptors.", 
    "75": "Having studied the functional state of beta-adrenoreceptors in vitro by the radioligand (3H-dihydroalprenalol) method it has been shown that cavinton in the concentration of 2.5 X 10(-6) M considerably increases the affinity of beta-adrenoreceptors for the ligand. In the in vivo experiments on rats the intraperitoneal injection of cavinton in the dose of 2 mg/kg causes an increase in the affinity of synaptosomal beta-adrenoreceptors for the ligand 10 days after chronic administration without altering the concentration of the receptors (Bmax) themselves. 20 days after the injection of the drug the affinity still grows and this effect of cavinton is retained even 30 days after the injection.", 
    "76": "The effect of prostaglandin synthesis inhibition and of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the blood pressure and renin response to the synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide atriopeptin III was assessed in unanesthetized normotensive rats. This peptide was infused i.v. for 30 min at a rate of 1 microgram/min in rats pretreated either with indomethacin (5 mg i.v.) or propranolol (1 mg i.v.). The blood pressure reducing effect of atriopeptin III was attenuated neither by indomethacin nor by propranolol. Atriopeptin III per se did not modify plasma renin activity. Both the administration of indomethacin and of propranolol had a suppressing effect on renin release during atriopeptin III infusion. These data suggest that the vasodilating properties of atrial natriuretic peptides do not depend in the conscious normotensive rats on the production of prostaglandins. They also provide evidence that during infusion of such peptides, both prostaglandins and beta-adrenergic mechanisms are still involved in the regulation of renin secretion.", 
    "77": "To investigate the role of physical conditioning in the regulation of cellular beta-adrenergic responsiveness in man, a simple and accurate method for the determination of lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors was developed and subsequently utilized for the characterization of these receptors in subjects with varying degrees of physical fitness. This method combines the advantages of the use of [125I]iodocyanopindolol as the radioligand and polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation for the separation of bound and unbound radioligand. The assay is quick and easy to perform and allows several samples to be processed simultaneously. The concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in lymphocytic membrane particulates in 16 healthy subjects was 58 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- SEM) and the Kd of the interaction between [125I]iodocyanopindolol and the receptor was 4 X 10(-11) mol/l. The receptor level was similar in both sexes. As compared with the controls, the cellular concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors was higher in eight regularly competing long-distance runners (73 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.025), whereas the corresponding receptor level in six sprinters (62 +/- 9 fmol/mg protein) did not differ from that of controls. The concentration of lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors in seven patients undergoing supine immobilization for weeks because of neck fracture or dislocation showed a wide range from 44 to 155 fmol/mg protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "In this study we characterize the beta 2 adrenergic dependent adenylate cyclase system of epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431). We show that the cells synthesize up to 130,000 [125I]-cyanopindolol binding sites per cell when freshly plated, a value which decreased to 40,000-50,000 receptors/cell within 24 hr. Production of this high number of receptors can be strongly inhibited by actinomycin D. We confirm and extend the fact that these beta-adrenoceptors are of the beta 2-subtype, using selective ligands, photoaffinity labeling with [125I]CYP-diazirine identified two protein subunits: p59 and p72, the beta 2-adrenoceptor dependent adenylate cyclase desensitizes with half-life of 2.2 +/- 0.3 min whereas the loss of [125I]CYP binding from the cell surface requires longer exposure times to the agonist, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) has no effect on the desensitization process nor does it have any effect on the modulation of beta-agonist affinity by guanyl nucleotides. Rather, PMA was found to stimulate adenylate cyclase activation by forskolin. We conclude that protein kinase C is probably not involved in the beta-adrenoceptor desensitization in this cell line.", 
    "79": "[3H]DHA binding studies show that main duct of rat submandibular gland has both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors, with the percentages of each being 69 and 31%, respectively, whereas whole submandibular gland has 90% beta 1 and 10% beta 2 adrenoceptors. Muscarinic receptors of main duct are 25% less than that of whole submandibular gland.", 
    "80": "Beta-adrenergic receptors were identified in slide-mounted sections of human trabecular meshwork by in-vitro labeling, light microscopic autoradiography. Autoradiograms were generated after incubation of slide-mounted tissue sections with 125I-cyanopindolol, a selective high-affinity probe for beta-adrenergic receptors. Experiments in which an excess of either unlabeled Practolol (beta 1 selective ligand) or Zinterol (beta 2 selective ligand) were included suggested that most of the receptors were of the beta 2 subtype. Data from displacement studies using increasing concentrations of the highly specific beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, ICI-89,406 and ICI-118,551, respectively, confirmed the predominance of the beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Similar results obtained with cultured trabecular endothelial cells suggest that the beta-adrenergic receptors may be associated with the endothelial cells of the trabecular meshwork in vivo. These results provide anatomic evidence for the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic agents improve outflow by direct action on the trabecular meshwork and provide a rationale for the development of more selective beta 2-adrenergic agents to increase outflow facility."
