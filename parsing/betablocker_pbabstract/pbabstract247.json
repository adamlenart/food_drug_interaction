    "0": "Latanoprost (Xalatan) is an ester analogue of prostaglandin F2alpha that reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The IOP-lowering efficacy of latanoprost 0.005% lasts for up to 24 hours after a single topical dose, which allows for a once-daily dosage regimen. In patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma, a single drop of latanoprost 0.005% solution (about 1.5 microg) administered topically once daily reduced diurnal IOP by 22 to 39% over 1 to 12 months' treatment in well-controlled trials; efficacy was maintained during treatment periods of up to 2 years. At this dosage, latanoprost was significantly more effective than timolol 0.5% twice daily in 3 of 4 large, double-blind, randomised studies, was generally as effective as bimatoprost or travoprost, and was significantly more effective than dorzolamide, brimonidine or unoprostone. Furthermore, in patients whose IOP was poorly controlled with timolol, switching to latanoprost monotherapy was at least as effective at lowering IOP as adding dorzolamide or pilocarpine to the regimen. Latanoprost has also shown significant additive effects when used in combination with one or more other glaucoma medications. The fixed combination of latanoprost plus timolol was significantly more effective than either of its individual components in two double-blind randomised studies and more effective than the fixed combination of dorzolamide and timolol in a 3-month, evaluator-masked study. Data in patients with angle-closure glaucoma are limited, but in patients with elevated IOP after undergoing iridotomy, latanoprost 0.005% once daily was significantly more effective than timolol 0.5% twice daily at reducing IOP over 12 weeks of treatment in a large double-blind, randomised study. Latanoprost is generally well tolerated and, unlike timolol, induces minimal systemic adverse events. In well-controlled, 6-month trials, the most commonly occurring drug-related ocular events in latanoprost recipients were mild to moderate conjunctival hyperaemia (3 to 15%) and iris colour change (2 to 9%); these seldom required patient withdrawal although the latter may be permanent. Latanoprost 0.005% as a single daily drop has shown good IOP-lowering efficacy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and does not produce the cardiopulmonary adverse effects associated with beta-blockers. Thus, latanoprost is a valuable addition to the first-line treatment options for patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In addition, adjunctive treatment with latanoprost in patients who are refractory to beta-blocker therapy is a viable, second-line treatment option. Although preliminary findings are promising, wider clinical experience is required to define the place of latanoprost in the treatment of angle-closure glaucoma.", 
    "1": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is prevalent in the elderly and often leads to disability. Consequently, strategies for optimising the prevention and treatment of CAD in the elderly are important from both the individual and societal perspectives. Although it is common knowledge that the elderly are heavy consumers of drugs, there is evidence to show that there is under-prescribing of evidence-based medical therapies in the home-dwelling elderly coronary patient and there may be overuse of some non-evidence-based (antioxidants) and purely symptomatic treatments. In particular, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, ACE inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are under-utilised. Although the evidence base is largely drawn from trials including patients younger than 75 years, it is reasonable to assume that the data applies to patients aged over 75 years and that better use of evidence-based medicines would provide benefits to the home-dwelling aged patient. Evidence from the few multifactorial studies available suggest possible benefits including reduction of cardiovascular events, less disability and better quality of life in old age. At the societal level, this would be reflected in fewer hospitalisations and institutionalisations, which means decreased cost of elderly care.", 
    "2": "A 79-year-old man with atrial fibrillation underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy and free flap reconstruction for hypolaryngeal cancer under general anesthesia. He developed tachyarrhythmia with ST depression and inverted T wave. The treatment including sufficient fluid therapy, continuous administration of vasodilator and intravenous digoxin failed to control the abnormalities. Then landiolol hydrochloride, a new cardioselective ultra-short acting beta-blocker, was continuously administered. Despite the relatively low doses with 1 min loading infusion at 0.04 mg.kg-1.min-1 and continuous infusion at 0.016 mg.kg1.min-1, rapid control of heart rate occurred in a few minutes and inverted T waves were normalized in fifteen minutes. There was no significant change of peripheral blood pressure. The present case suggests that landiolol hydrochloride is effective in controlling heart rate in a patient with atrial fibrillation and that the optimal dose should be carefully evaluated for each case.", 
    "3": "Two exploratory experiments examined the effects of flashing light stimulation on growth, mortality, and behavioral preferences of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Experiment 1 showed that tadpoles exposed to continuous visual stimulation, from egg-laying through postnatal day 40, had significantly higher mortality rates and weighed significantly less than controls. In contrast to controls, experimental tadpoles showed a preference for visual stimulation throughout early development. Results support the notion that augmented visual stimulation during early development affects species-typical development and the creation of postnatal preferences. Experiment 2 exposed subjects to propranolol in their water to investigate a potential sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mechanism responsible for the previous results. Tadpoles exposed to propranolol and visual stimulation simultaneously did not show a preference for the visual stimulation. Although this preliminary finding suggests SNS involvement, this notion deserves further investigation.",

The HR after an administration of atropine was attenuated by 5.5 +/- 2.4% (p < 0.05) during hyperbaric exposure. The HR after a simultaneous administration of atropine and propranolol, the intrinsic HR, was similar throughout the dive periods. Plasma NE decreased at 3 ATA (p < 0.05). The basal level of high-frequency power of cardiac interval variability, an index of cardiac parasympathetic modulation, remained unchanged throughout the dive period, whereas this power was eliminated by atropine administration.",

    "16": "The effects of propranolol on the glycogen autophagy in newborn rat hepatocytes were studied by using biochemical determinations, electron microscopy and morphometric analysis. Propranolol lowered the liver cyclic AMP and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity. It also decreased the formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-inhibitable Ca2+-ATPase activity including lysosomal calcium uptake pump. The normal postnatal increase in the volume of autophagic vacuoles and the activity of acid glycogen-hydrolyzing alpha glucosidase were inhibited. Also, the degradation of glycogen inside the autophagic vacuoles was apparently inhibited. The activity of acid mannose 6-phosphatase was increased. These findings indicate that propranolol influences several steps in the sequence of events leading to the breakdown of glycogen in the autophagic vacuoles of newborn rat hepatocytes. This supports our previous studies suggesting that cyclic AMP regulates glycogen autophagy.", 
    "17": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a therapy change from timolol to betaxolol on ocular blood flow in patients with open-angle glaucoma. This randomized double-blind study comprised 34 consecutive patients with open-angle glaucoma, already treated with either timolol alone or in combination with other antiglaucoma agents. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either betaxolol (n = 17) or timolol (n = 17) instead of the present timolol drops. Additional antiglaucoma therapy remained unchanged. The retinal blood flow was assessed by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry and the pulsatile choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser interferometric measurement of fundus pulsation amplitude. Ocular blood flow measurement as well as systemic hemodynamic and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed at baseline and 1 week and 1 and 3 months after the therapy change. Visual field testing was performed at baseline and at 3 months. After 3 months of treatment with either timolol or betaxolol, neither the retinal nor the pulsatile choroidal blood flow were significantly altered. The power to detect a 9% change in pulsatile choroidal blood flow and a 20% change in retinal blood flow in the present study was 90%. The IOP was not significantly altered in either group. In contrast, visual fields slightly improved after betaxolol treatment compared to baseline (p = 0.047), but this effect was not significant versus timolol. Changing therapy from timolol to betaxolol has no effect on ocular blood flow in patients with open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "18": "Aldosterone classically promotes unidirectional transepithelial sodium transport, thereby regulating blood volume and blood pressure. Recently, both clinical and experimental studies have suggested additional, direct roles for aldosterone in the cardiovascular system. To evaluate aldosterone activation of cardiomyocyte mineralocorticoid receptors, transgenic mice overexpressing 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 in cardiomyocytes were generated using the mouse alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter. This enzyme converts glucocorticoids to receptor-inactive metabolites, allowing aldosterone occupancy of cardiomyocyte mineralocorticoid receptors. Transgenic mice were normotensive but spontaneously developed cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and heart failure and died prematurely on a normal salt diet. Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, ameliorated this phenotype. These studies confirm the deleterious consequences of inappropriate activation of cardiomyocyte mineralocorticoid receptors by aldosterone and reveal a tonic inhibitory role of glucocorticoids in preventing such outcomes under physiological conditions. In addition, these data support the hypothesis that aldosterone blockade may provide additional therapeutic benefit in the treatment of heart failure.",

The permeation rate of [3H]PPL as measured by steady-state fluxes increased with increasing EtOH concentration. A significant flux enhancement (P<0.05) was achieved by EtOH at 20 and 30 %v/v concentrations. At a 0.5 %w/v permeation enhancer concentration, the buccal permeation of [3H]PPL was significantly enhanced by all the enhancers studied (i.e., LPC, DDPC and STDHF) compared to the control (phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4, PBS). LPC and DDPC displayed a greater degree of permeation enhancement compared with STDHF and EtOH-PBS mixtures with an enhancement ratio of 3.2 and 2.9 for LPC and DDPC, respectively compared with 2.0 and 1.5 for STDHF and EtOH:PBS 30:70 %v/v mixture, respectively. There was no significant difference between LPC and DDPC for the flux values and apparent permeability coefficients of [3H]PPL. These results suggest that phospholipids are suitable as permeation enhancers for the buccal delivery of drugs.", 
    "27": "Most wide-complex tachycardias encountered in the emergency department (ED) are ventricular in origin, most commonly associated with structural heart disease. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias range in severity from life-threatening rhythms (eg, ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically compromising ventricular tachycardia [VT]) to idiopathic forms of VT, which have a benign clinical course and a more favorable prognosis. The authors present the case of a 34-year-old woman who presented to the ED, with a wide-complex tachycardia with a right-bundle-branch block (RBBB) morphology and a right inferior axis, which was terminated with adenosine. The patient was previously misdiagnosed as suffering from a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which was unresponsive to beta-blocker therapy. Although the tachycardia responded to adenosine, suggestive of an SVT, the patient was referred to the arrhythmia service, where further work-up revealed an uncommon form of an idiopathic VT, originating from the left anterior fascicle. The authors discuss the unique electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic properties and useful diagnostic maneuvers required to properly identify this form of VT.", 
    "28": "The pathogenesis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and transient myocardial ischemia (TMI) is not completely understood. Therefore, the authors studied the biological indicators of thrombogenesis and sympathetic activity. The study was conducted on 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome and 30 patients with stable angina pectoris. Treatment was standardized with low-molecular-weight heparin and 300 mg aspirin/day but with no IIb/IIIa inhibitors, an oral beta-blocker, diltiazem 60 mg tid, glyceryl trinitrate i.v. in patients with ACS but with mononitrates orally and low-molecular-weight heparin in patients with stable angina. Twenty-four-hour continuous ECG monitoring and ST segment analysis were performed on day 2 of admission and heart rate analysis was performed 10, 5, and 1 minute before and during the myocardial ischemia periods. Blood sampling for von Willebrand factor (vWf) determination was performed through a peripheral vein at 8 AM, noon, 6 PM and 10 PM and half an hour after the description of angina. The patients with ACS were grouped as transient myocardial ischemia positive (n = 20) and negative (n = 30). The patients with stable angina were designated as the control group (n = 30). The detected vWf levels at 4 different daytime periods in patients with ACS were significantly higher than those in patients with stable angina. At the 6 PM to 10 PM period, the vWf level increase was significantly higher in patients with TMI than in the patients without TMI. At the 8 AM to noon period, the detected vWf levels decreased significantly in both TMI groups. During the nocturnal ischemia periods, the increase in vWf levels immediately after angina was significantly more apparent than the detected changes during daytime ischemia. Analysis showed that heart rates before the ischemia during stable angina episodes were significantly higher than those in TMI (-) (silent) angina. The heart rate difference between 10 minutes before and during the ischemia in the angina group was significantly different from that during TMI (-) (silent) ischemia. The heart rates at the times related to ischemia in the nocturnal period were significantly lower than those in the daytime period. The heart rate differences between the ischemia-related times and during the ischemia were significantly higher in daytime ischemic attacks than in nocturnal ischemic attacks. The study confirms that the vWf level, which is an indicator of thrombogenesis, was significantly increased in patients with ACS. Nocturnal ischemia is associated with thrombogenesis. Daytime ischemia is associated with increased sympathetic activity, and symptomatic ischemia is usually associated with increased sympathetic activity.",

The ratio of systolic to diastolic time-velocity integral and the systolic fraction of time-velocity integrals subsequently decreased. Women with PIH also presented a significantly increased velocity of reversal PVF at atrial contraction, a decrease in the ratio between mitral and PVF duration at atrial contraction and a slower flow propagation velocity with M-mode color Doppler. LV wall thickness and mass were significantly higher in hypertensive pregnant women. In women with PIH the abnormal PVF parameters became similar to those of controls immediately after delivery, while the E/A ratio, M-mode flow propagation velocity and LV mass did so after 1 month.",

    "33": "In contrast to widely held perceptions regarding tolerability of beta-blockers in heart failure, it is clear that initiation and uptitration is not as complex as perceived. In particular, there is no increased risk of intolerance and/or worsening of heart failure symptoms with initiation of beta-blocker therapy (at least as demonstrated by carvedilol in COPERNICUS). Furthermore, the perceived delay in beneficial effects on outcomes is perhaps challenged by the COPERNICUS study. Interestingly, all of the above observations appear to hold true in patients with advanced disease. Because of the unique history of beta-blockers in systolic heart failure, physicians have needed particular reassurance regarding the tolerability of these agents. Reassurance regarding tolerability has now been definitively provided.", 
    "34": "The lipophilic beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol and hydrophilic atenolol have been studied to define their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics in obese patients. A total of 43 subjects were allocated into three study groups: (1) healthy, lean, normolipaemic volunteers, (2) obese normolipaemic subjects, and (3) obese patients with lipid disorders. A crossover method with an interval of 2 weeks was applied for oral 80 mg propranolol and oral 100 mg atenolol administration. Heart rate as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure were recorded during 24 h. At each time-point of measurement blood serum concentration of propranolol and atenolol were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs were calculated using a one-compartment open model for extravascular administration. There were no statistically significant differences in blood serum concentrations of propranolol between the studied groups. The concentrations of atenolol were significantly lower in both normolipaemic and hyperlipidaemic obese subjects. A trend towards increase in Vd/F and Cl/F of propranolol in obese patients with hyperlipidaemia were noted. In the case of water-soluble atenolol, the AUC, C(max), Cl/(F x BW) were significantly lower in obese hyperlipidaemic and normolipaemic patients in comparison with lean subjects. The pharmacodynamic effects of propranolol and atenolol in obese and lean subjects were of similar magnitude. The observed differences between obese and non-obese persons were clinically not relevant.",

CL-316243 concentration dependently relaxed the ureteral contraction, the pD(2) value being 7.75 +/- 0.11. This relaxation was competitively antagonized by the selective beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR58894A and by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bupranolol, their pA(2) values being 7.08 +/- 0.08 and 6.43 +/- 0.09, respectively. CGP-12177A concentration dependently reduced the KCl-induced contraction, the pD(2) value being 6.30 +/- 0.25. Even at 1 x 10(-5) mol/l, CGP-20712A (a selective beta(1)- adrenoceptor antagonist) did not shift the concentration-response curves for CL-316243 or CGP-12177A. SR58894A did not induce a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for CGP-12177A, but bupranolol did produce such a shift, pA(2) and slope values in the Schild plot being 7.15 +/- 0.77 and 0.60 +/- 0.15, respectively. Hence, the competition characteristics for SR58894A and bupranolol differed between the CL- 316243-induced and CGP-12177A-induced relaxations. Our results suggest that CGP-12177A produces ureteral relaxation in the dog via an atypical beta-adrenoceptor (possibly, an atypical site/state of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor) as well as via the typical beta(3)-adrenoceptor.",

Current formulations and dosing of antihypertensive drugs do not provide maximum coverage during this vulnerable period. This study was performed to demonstrate that propranolol CR (Innopran XL), a novel chronotherapeutic formulation of propranolol designed for nighttime dosing, has appropriate pharmacokinetics to provide maximum cardioprotective effect in the morning. Pharmacokinetics of propranolol CR and sustained-release propranolol after single and multiple doses were determined in normal male volunteers in this open-label, 2-period crossover study. The drugs were dosed in the evening and serial blood samples were taken for determination of propranolol concentration the next 24 to 72 hours. After a single 160-mg dose of propranolol CR administered at 10 pm, absorption was delayed by about 4 hours, after which plasma concentration rose steadily, reaching a peak at about 10:00 am. In contrast, after dosing with sustained release propranolol, plasma levels of propranolol began to rise almost immediately, reaching a plateau between 4:00 am and 10:00 am. During multiple dosing, steady-state trough plasma concentrations were achieved after 2 days with either drug. After the final dose, the plasma profiles of both drugs were similar to those observed in the single-dose study. Bioavailability was similar for both formulations of propranolol. Propranolol CR exhibited appropriate pharmacokinetics for a chronotherapeutic approach to the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "38": "In recent years, it has become increasingly recognised that a central feature of the disease progression associated with heart failure is the process of left ventricular remodeling. The remodeling process manifests as an increase in left ventricular volumes, leading to a rise in wall stress and a compensatory increase in myocardial mass. The left ventricle also gradually assumes a more spherical shape, resulting in functional mitral regurgitation leading to further haemodynamic overload, worsening myocardial function and an unfavourable clinical course. Accumulating clinical data support the hypothesis that the benefits in clinical outcome with ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers may relate to modification of the remodeling process resulting in slowing of disease progression and preservation of contractile function. The general trend from a number of clinical studies indicates that whereas ACE-inhibitors seem to prevent progressive left ventricular dilatation, the third generation beta-blocker, carvedilol, may actually reverse the remodelling process by reducing left ventricular volumes and improving systolic function. Direct comparisons indicate that carvedilol has a similar safety and tolerability profile to ACE-inhibitors and thereby support the feasibility of administering this drug as first-line therapy in selected patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. Therefore, the decision to initiate treatment with carvedilol or an ACE-inhibitor might in future be tailored on an individual basis and followed thereafter by combination therapy at the earliest and safest opportunity. Finally, the possible development of treatment strategies addressing the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the remodeling process and the recently published benefits of device therapies herald a combined, synergistic approach to the future management of heart failure.",

    "40": "Depression is a multifaceted psychological disorder that involves changes in behavior, neuroendocrine function, and physiological responses. The present study investigated multiple behavioral and cardiovascular consequences in the chronic mild stress (CMS) rodent model of depression. Rats were exposed to 4 weeks of CMS followed by 4 weeks of a stress-free recovery period. Sucrose intake, a measure of anhedonia, and spontaneous locomotor activity were measured weekly throughout the study, and cardiovascular function tests were conducted at the completion of the protocol. The results indicate that CMS results in anhedonia and reduced locomotor activity, as well as elevated heart rate (HR), reduced HR variability, and elevated sympathetic cardiac tone. The behavioral effects of CMS recovered to baseline (prestress) levels during the recovery period; however, cardiovascular changes were observed following the recovery of sucrose intake and activity levels. The present findings suggest that behavioral changes that are indicative of anhedonia and locomotor alterations associated with depression are dissociable from long-term cardiovascular changes induced by CMS.", 
    "41": "Earlier studies demonstrated that cytokine production is under the tonic control of noradrenaline. As the level and/or the duration of noradrenaline action is regulated by the noradrenaline transporter (NET), which is also a target of antidepressant treatment, we studied its role in the regulation of the cytokine response during inflammation. The endotoxin-evoked tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 response was studied in genetically produced noradrenaline transporter-deficient (NET-KO) mice and by treatment with desipramine, a monoamine uptake-blocker antidepressant. NET-KO mice responded to endotoxin with significantly lower TNF-alpha and interleukin-10 production in comparison to their wild-type counterparts. Functional involvement of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors could be demonstrated in our model systems, using 7,8-methylenedioxy-14 alpha-hydroxy-alloberbane.HCl (CH-38083) and propranolol; however, the differences between the two phenotypes remained, suggesting a limited role of alpha-adrenoceptors in the observed changes. Acute treatment of both wild-type and NET-KO mice with desipramine significantly decreased the TNF-alpha response and significantly increased interleukin-10 production, indicating the role of an intact noradrenaline transporter in anti-inflammatory responses.", 
    "42": "Molecular mechanisms underlying the metamorphosis of larvae, e.g., ligand and receptor interaction, have to be determined and roles for the nervous system in marine invertebrates are not well understood. We report here that treatment of swimming larvae of the ascidian Ciona savignyi with noradrenaline or adrenaline promoted morphological changes in early metamorphosis, e.g., tail resorption. Antagonists of the beta-adrenergic receptor, propranolol, and the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, metoprolol, inhibited the noradrenaline-induced tail resorption, while an antagonist of the alpha-adrenergic receptor, phentolamine, and of the beta(2)- adrenergic receptor, butoxamine, had no inhibitory effects. In addition, a selective agonist of the beta-adrenergic receptor, isoproterenol, the concentration of which was lower than the effective concentration of the neurotransmitters, facilitated tail resorption. Immunohistochemical studies, using an anti-dopamine-hydroxylase antibody, showed that neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline and adrenaline localized around the brain vesicle of the larvae during metamorphosis. The beta(1)-adrenergic receptor stained with antibodies was localized on the nervous system. Temporal expression of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was intense in the nervous system in the larvae competent for metamorphosis.

Based on this observation, we developed a new test called the Spheroid Cell Spreading Inhibition Test (SCSIT) to screen hepatic cytotoxicity of xenobiotics and determine the spheroid cell spreading inhibition concentration (SCSIC) of test chemicals. Four model hepatoxicants, D-galactosamine, propranolol, diclofenac, and paracetamol, were studied with SCSIT in both rat liver and HepG2 spheroids. Both liver and HepG2 spheroids were prepared under gyrotatory culture conditions and used at 6 days in vitro. The results showed that all four hepatotoxicants tested inhibited cell spreading in liver spheroids (D-galactosamine at 20 mM, propranolol at 125 microM, diclofenac at 500 microM, and paracetamol at 25 mM) and HepG2 spheroids (D-galactosamine at 16 mM, propranolol at 125 microM, diclofenac at 500 microM, and paracetamol at 25 mM). The SCSIT results agreed with the conventional cytotoxic indicators, release of LDH and/or gamma-GT and the inhibition of glucose secretion from rat liver spheroids. In conclusion, this study, for the first time, described the biological characteristics of liver and HepG2 spheroid cell spreading and demonstrates its application in hepatic cytotoxicity studies. This method may be used in testing in vitro \"acute\" toxicity, comparing relative cytotoxicity and generating reference concentrations for subsequent studies. Therefore, SCSIT could be a useful tool for screening hepatotoxicity relevant to preclinical lead optimization and compound library screening.", 
    "44": "Cytotoxicity endpoints, spontaneous glucose secretion/consumption and LDH and gamma-GT release, were characterised in rat liver and HepG2 spheroids as in vitro models for toxicology studies. Preprepared rat liver spheroids and HepG2 spheroids cultured in a six-well plate format were exposed to varying concentrations of galactosamine, propranolol, diclofenac, and paracetamol. All four model toxins significantly affected glucose secretion, which agreed well with LDH and/or gamma-GT release in rat liver spheroids. These toxins also significantly increased LDH and/or gamma-GT release in HepG2 spheroids. Whereas glucose consumption in HepG2 spheroids did not show conclusive results, LDH activities in both types of spheroids were similar and their levels were relatively high. Accordingly, the level of LDH leakage in both types of spheroids was much higher than gamma-GT after exposure to the toxins. In contrast, gamma-GT activity in HepG2 spheroids was sixfold higher than that in rat liver spheroids. This study revealed that galactosamine interfered with the gamma-GT assay and paracetamol interfered with the LDH assay. It demonstrated, for the first time, that glucose secretion by liver spheroids can be used as a functional indicator of cytotoxicity. Test compounds may interfere with enzymatic assays as indicated by LDH and gamma-GT release in this study. Combining functional parameters together with two or more indicators of enzyme releases can provide a reliable cytotoxicity evaluation. Liver and HepG2 spheroids as in vitro models showed good predictions in chemical-induced hepatic cytotoxicity.",

    "46": "In the 148 eyes that reached definite progression, we first determined changes between baseline and the time of definite EMGT progression, both for mean deviation (MD) and for number of highly (p < 0.5%) significantly depressed test points in pattern deviation probability maps. Second, we studied whether such changes depended on baseline MD, intraocular pressure (IOP), age and time to progression, all of which are factors that affect the rate of field progression.", 
    "47": "In eyes reaching progression, the mean change in MD from baseline was -1.93 dB (SE +/- 0.20) and the mean change in number of significant points was +4.85 (SE +/- 0.35). These changes did not show linear dependency on baseline MD, IOP or time to progression.", 
    "48": "The average amount of field deterioration needed to reach EMGT visual field progression has been measured and expressed in more conventional units (i.e. a loss of about - 2dB in MD and an increase in about five highly significant points). These estimates will facilitate the clinical interpretation of the results of EMGT.",

Patients were then switched to the other treatment regimen. Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were measured every 2 hours between 08 : 00 and 20 : 00 hours at baseline and at the end of periods 1 and 2.", 
    "51": "This study found that in 32 subjects the IOP diurnal curve on timolol alone (20.9 +/- 2.8 mmHg) decreased to 17.9 +/- 3.2 mmHg when patients were treated with TLFC and to 19.0 +/- 2.4 mmHg when patients were treated with brimonidine and timolol (p = 0.02). Intraocular pressures at individual time-points were statistically similar between the groups at the 08 : 00 trough and 2 and 4 hours after dosing. However, beyond 4 hours after dosing, TLFC-treated subjects demonstrated a trend towards lower IOPs at each 2-hour time-point that was not statistically significant after a Bonferroni correction (p <or= 0.05). The incidence of both solicited and unsolicited side-effects was similar between groups.",

The effects of concentration and type of dye and molecular weight and percentage deacetylation of chitosan on their miscibility and physical stability were investigated. High concentration of dye and high molecular weight and percentage deacetylation of chitosan resulted in precipitation or colloidal dispersion due to ionic interaction between dye and the polymer. The effect was more prominent upon storage. The miscibility of dye and the polymer depended on the molecular configuration and ionic group in the dye molecule. It was ranked brilliant blue approximately euqal to green FS > fast green > ponceau SX approximately euqal to green sunset yellow > erythrosine approximately euqal to green tartrazin > indigo carmine. Solutions of low molecular weight chitosan with and without green FS were then used as coating formulations onto propranolol hydrochloride core tablets. There was no color migration on coated tablets even after storage for 1 year. Disintegration and drug dissolution from tablets coated with colored film were slightly slower than those from tablets coated with plain film and core tablet, respectively. This was corresponding to the results of swelling and dissolution of cast films. However, all tablets conformed to the specification in monograph of USP XXIV.",

The produced data and three other sets collected from a recent work are employed to study the accuracy and prediction capability of a mathematical model to calculate the electrophoretic mobility with respect to the volume fractions of the solvents in the mixture. The results show that the proposed model is able to correlate/predict the mobility within an acceptable error range and it is possible to use the model in industry to achieve the optimum solvent composition for the buffer where using a ternary solvent system is required. The average percentage deviations (APDs) obtained for correlated and predicted data points are 0.71-2.48 and 1.72-4.39%, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed model is compared with that of a mixture response surface method and the results show that the proposed model is superior from both correlation and prediction points of view. The possibility of calculation of the mobility of chemically related drugs in water-methanol-ethanol mixtures using the proposed model is also shown and the produced prediction APD is approximately 8%.", 
    "55": "Aquaporin adipose (AQPap) is a putative glycerol channel in adipocytes. It has recently been shown to be upregulated in insulin resistance stimulated by thiazolidinediones and inhibited by insulin. To further clarify regulation of AQPap gene expression, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were chronically treated with various hormones known to influence insulin sensitivity and adipocyte metabolism, and AQPap mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, treatment of 3T3-Ll adipocytes with 10 micro M isoproterenol, 10 ng/ml TNFalpha, and 100 nM dexamethasone for 16 h inhibited AQPap gene expression by 62 %, 60 %, and 39 %, respectively; angiotensin 2, growth hormone, and triiodothyronine did not have any effect. The inhibitory effects were dose-dependent with significant suppression detectable at concentrations as low as 1 nM isoproterenol, 1 ng/ml TNFalpha, and 10 nM dexamethasone. Furthermore, inhibition of AQPap gene expression could be almost completely reversed by pretreating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Moreover, stimulation of Gs-proteins with cholera toxin and adenylyl cyclase with forskolin and dibutyryl-cAMP dramatically downregulated AQPap mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that AQPap is an adipocyte-expressed glycerol channel selectively regulated and profoundly downregulated by hormones implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.",

In an attempt to sustain cell and mitochondrial integrity during ischemia, intramitochondrial F(0)F(1) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase reverses its activity and hydrolyzes ATP to maintain the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (mdeltapsi). It is not known how cytoplasmic ATP becomes available for hydrolysis by this enzyme. The authors hypothesized that mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) reverses its activity during ischemia, making cytoplasmic ATP available for hydrolysis by F(0)F(1) ATP synthase.",

    "65": "Many cell models that are used to assess basic cytotoxicity show a good correlation with acute toxicity. However, their correlation with the toxicity seen following chronic in vivo exposure is less evident. The new human hepatoma cell line HBG BC2 possesses the capacity of being reversibly differentiated in vitro and of maintaining a relatively higher metabolic rate when in the differentiated state (3 weeks) as compared to HepG2 cells, and thus may allow the conduct of repeated toxicity testing on cells in culture. In order to evaluate the genetic background of HBG BC2 cells, the expression of selected genes was analyzed in untreated cultures and, in addition, the behavior of HBG BC2 cultures under conditions of repeated treatment was studied with acetaminophen as a test substance and coupled with the use of standard staining techniques to demonstrate toxicity. Results showed that cultures of HBG BC2 cells retained a capacity to undergo apoptosis and proliferation, allowing probable replacement of damaged cells in the culture monolayer. MTT reduction was used to evaluate the toxicity of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, perhexiline, and propranolol, after both single and repeated (3 times/week for 2 weeks) administration. Under the conditions of repeated treatment, cytotoxicity was observed at lower doses as compared to single administration. In addition, the lowest nontoxic doses were in the same range as plasma concentrations measured in humans under therapeutic use. Our results suggest that the new human hepatoma HBG BC2 cell line is of interest for the evaluation of cell toxicity under conditions of repeated administration.",

    "67": "Endocardial pacing leads were implanted in the right ventricle, right atrium, and coronary sinus in 18 dogs. The right ventricular lead was connected to an implanted pacemaker capable of rapid ventricular pacing. The atrial leads were used to perform electrophysiologic studies in conscious animals at baseline in all dogs, during CHF induced by rapid ventricular pacing at 235 beats/min in 15 dogs, and during recovery from CHF in 6 dogs. After 20 +/- 7 days of rapid ventricular pacing, inducibility of sustained atrial tachycardia (cycle length 120 +/- 12 msec) was enhanced in dogs with CHF. Atrial tachycardia required a critical decrease in atrial burst pacing cycle length (< or = 130 msec) for induction and often could be terminated by overdrive pacing. Calcium antagonists (verapamil, flunarizine, ryanodine) terminated atrial tachycardia and suppressed inducibility. Effective refractory periods at 400- and 300-msec cycle lengths in the right atrium and coronary sinus were prolonged in dogs with CHF. Atrial cells from dogs with CHF had prolonged action potential durations and reduced resting potentials and delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs). Mitochondria from atrial tissue from dogs with CHF were enlarged and had internal cristae disorganization.",

These actions confer to the above mentioned betablocker some beneficial properties on several processes involving cardiovascular system. Carvedilol provides haemodynamic, antiischemic, antiproliferative and antiarrhytmic benefits, for its antioxidant neurohumoral and electrophysiological effects. All these actions provide the basis for usefulness of the drug in the treatment of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and congestive heart failure. In this review we report the beneficial properties of Carvedilol and we analyze the rational clinical use of this betablocker taking special attention on recent clinical trial in heart failure where it appears an evidence supporting an important, favourable effect of the drug.",

A history of coronary heart disease was associated with an increased total risk for HF, as were hemodialysis (versus peritoneal dialysis), aspirin use, and a history of diabetes. However, hemodialysis and aspirin use were the only factors associated with both de novo and recurrent HF. Widened pulse pressure was associated with de novo HF. The mortality rate after HF was 83% at 3 years (adjusted hazard ratio for mortality, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.80 to 2.45; P < 0.0001).",

More recently, the focus has been on the neurohormonal system, specifically the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system. Drugs that inhibit or block these systems (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blocking drugs) are the primary agents recommended in recent heart failure guidelines. However, the actual percent reduction in mortality associated with the use of these agents has been relatively modest. This article will review the results and limitations of medical therapy for heart failure. Our understanding of the pathogenesis of heart failure may be incomplete, and alternative strategies, including mechanical devices, may play an increasing role in the treatment of heart failure in the future.", 
    "76": "According to published data, the ability to prevent various hypertension-related events differs between the various antihypertensive drug groups. Although absolute drug effects differ among studies, relative drug effects could be considered constant. We therefore explored the possibility of drawing statistically valid conclusions about the differences in clinical efficacy between various drug groups by doing an overview of published data.", 
    "77": "We made a meta-analysis with a Bayesian fixed effect model in which we related the drug effects to the effects of placebo drugs. We selected 27 clinical trials from the literature according to specific criteria, including results from studies reporting the effects of the newer drugs when tested against diuretics and beta-blockers, and from studies in which diuretics and beta-blockers had been tested against placebo. We calculated the posterior probability distributions of the relative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors vs calcium antagonists with three different endpoints: stroke, coronary disease and heart failure with point estimates of effects and with 95% credibility intervals. As an intermediate step in this procedure we obtained similar information about the effects of the three groups of active drugs, ACE inhibitors, calcium antagonists and diuretics or beta-blockers, tested against placebo. For coronary disease we also tested calcium antagonists against diuretics or beta-blockers.",

On the other hand, calcium antagonists reduce coronary disease by only 8% relative to placebo. When ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are compared with the Bayesian method, the outcome is a 14% difference in favor of the ACE inhibitors to prevent coronary disease, with a credibility interval almost reaching identity. Nor do calcium antagonists do as well as diuretics or beta-blockers in this respect, RR = 1.12 with 95% credibility interval 1.01-1.24. All the tested drug groups have a profound preventive effect on the occurrence of heart failure when given to hypertensive patients, showing reductions of 42-54%.

    "80": "The aim of this work was to assess whether stress and estrous cycle phases affected the beta1-adrenoceptor (beta1-AR) site activated by CGP12177 in the right atria of rats. The chronotropic response to CGP12177 in the absence or presence of antagonists was determined in atria from rats submitted to one daily foot-shock session for 3 consecutive days. Blood was collected for hormonal assays. The pD2 for CGP12177 in atria from females was lower than in atria from males and was unaltered by stress or the estrous cycle. Propranolol (200 nM) or CGP20712A (3 microM) shifted the concentration-response curves to CGP12177 to the right in control and stressed estrus or control diestrus rats. Atria from stressed diestrus rats were resistant to blockade by propranolol or CGP20712A, indicating that the effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on the response to CGP12177 is influenced by estrous cycle phases. The stress-induced increase in serum corticosterone levels was independent of the estrous cycle or gender, but the estradiol/progesterone ratio was affected differently in the two groups of female rats. In the diestrus group, serum estradiol levels decreased after the first foot-shock session and remained low until the day of sacrifice, whereas in the estrus group the serum levels of estradiol did not decrease after stress and peaked on the second day, which corresponded to proestrus. These data do not indicate whether there is a direct or indirect effect of stress hormones and (or) sex steroids on cardiac beta1-AR sensitivity. However, they do show that the classic and low-affinity binding sites of the beta1-AR are independently regulated and that the beta1-AR atypical site affinity for antagonists depends on the estrous cycle.",

Prescriptions for diuretics, digitalis preparations, and calcium channel blockers (CCB) were filled by 69%, 34%, and 32%, respectively. Therefore, almost half of patients with CHF were not receiving ACEI therapy, even though it had been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality related to CHF. Furthermore, three-quarters of patients were not receiving BB therapy, a similarly effective therapy.

    "85": "Direct stereoselective separation on chiral stationary phase was developed for HPLC analysis of the four stereoisomers of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in human plasma and urine. Plasma samples were prepared using solid-phase extraction columns and urine samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction. The stereoisomers were separated on a Chiralpak AD column at 24 degrees C with fluorescence detection and a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of hexane:ethanol:isopropanol:diethylamine (88:10.2:1.8:0.2) for plasma samples and hexane:ethanol:diethylamine (88:12:0.2) for urine samples. Calibration curves for the individual stereoisomers were linear within the concentration range of 2.0-200 ng/ml plasma or 0.125-25 microg/ml urine. The methods were validated with intra- and interday variations less than 15%. The absolute configuration of the pure stereoisomers were assigned by circular dichroism spectra. The methods were employed to determine the concentrations of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol stereoisomers in a metabolism study of multiple-dose administration of racemic metoprolol to hypertensive patients phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of debrisoquine. We observed stereo-selectivity in the alpha-hydroxymetoprolol formation favoring the new 1'R chiral center from both metoprolol enantiomers (AUC(0-24) (1'R1'S) = 3.02). The similar renal clearances (Cl(R)) of the four stereoisomers demonstrated absence of stereoselectivity in their renal excretion. (-)-(S)-metoprolol was slightly more alpha-hydroxylated than its antipode (AUC(0-24) (2S/2R) = 1.19), suggesting that this pathway is not responsible for plasma accumulation of this enantiomer in humans.", 
    "86": "Nonselective beta-blockers are very effective in preventing first variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Treatment with isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-MN) plus propranolol achieves a greater reduction in portal pressure than propranolol alone. The present multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial evaluated whether combined drug therapy could be more effective than propranolol alone in preventing variceal bleeding. A total of 349 consecutive cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices were randomized to receive propranolol + placebo (n = 174) or propranolol + IS-MN (n = 175). There were no significant differences in the 1- and 2-year actuarial probability of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups (propranolol + placebo, 8.3% and 10.6%; propranolol + IS-MN, 5% and 12.5%). The only independent predictor of variceal bleeding was a variceal size greater than 5 mm. However, among patients with varices greater than 5 mm (n = 196), there were no significant differences in the incidence of variceal bleeding between the 2 groups. Survival was also similar. Adverse effects were significantly more frequent in the propranolol + IS-MN group due to a greater incidence of headache. There were no significant differences in the incidence of new-onset or worsening ascites or in impairment of renal function. In conclusion, propranolol effectively prevents variceal bleeding. Adding IS-MN does not further decrease the low residual risk of bleeding in patients receiving propranolol. However, the long-term use of this combination drug therapy is safe and may be an alternative in clinical conditions associated with a greater risk of bleeding.", 
    "87": "Experiments were conducted to delineate the cellular changes modulated by acute cold/restraint stress (ACRS), a physical and psychological stressor, in response to a Listeria monocytogenes(LM) infection. In addition to wild type (WT) BALB/c mice, CD4-deficient (CD4-/-) BALB/c mice, which have no effective adaptive immunity, were used to determine the involvement of adaptive versus innate immunity. ACRS-induced suppression of host resistance to LM was not observed in CD4-/- mice, suggesting the involvement of CD4+T cells in the acute cold/restraint stress (ACRS)-induced inhibition. The in vivo splenic leukocyte phenotypes and activities of WT BALB/c mice after infection and in vitro lymphocyte responses to heat-killed LM (HKLM) also were examined. There were no significant differences in the numbers of splenic T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, or neutrophils between nonstressed and ACRS-treated WT mice. However, higher levels of activated T cells and non-T lymphocytes were observed in the ACRS-treated mice; beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-ADR) antagonists (propranolol and atenolol) eliminated these elevated levels of activation, as well as the ACRS-induced suppression of host resistance. ACRS and control mice also had equivalent activation of macrophages. With in vitro HKLM stimulation, splenocytes from ACRS-treated mice produced significantly higher levels of IFNgamma and slightly higher levels of IL-6 in comparison with the nonstressed mice, although equivalent levels of lymphocyte proliferation were obtained. Additionally, ACRS-treated mice showed comparable elevation of serum nitric oxide after infection, indicating macrophage bactericidal activity similar to nonstressed mice. Thus, it appears that ACRS inhibits host resistance through regulatory CD4+ T cells and/or effector cell functions downstream of CD4+ T cell activation, as well as through beta-ADR signaling, in that blockage of these receptors appears to aid host defenses by means other than elevation of helper T cell activity. Because CD4 T cell deficiency and beta-ADR blockage produced equivalent effects, beta-ADR+ CD4+ T cells may have a negative role on host defenses after ACRS.",

Propranolol infusion significantly increased the GHRH-induced GH secretion, but it did not block glucose-induced suppression of GH secretion. Isoproterenol infusion alone significantly suppressed GHRH-induced GH secretion and augmented the inhibitory action of glucose on GH release.", 
    "91": "This study demonstrates that glucose-induced suppression of GHRH-stimulated GH release is independent of beta-adrenergic tone. Since previous data supports a role for SRIH in both glucose and beta-adrenergic suppression of GH release, the current results suggest that subsets of SRIH neurons are differentially responsive to these external cues. Therefore, a combined glucose and isoproterenol test may provide a useful assessment of hypothalamic somatostatinergic activity.",

IOP was measured at baseline and 2 hours after morning instillation at weeks 2, 4, and 12. The primary outcome measure was the mean IOP reduction from baseline. Secondary measures were the percentage of patients in each group who achieved specific low target pressures and the incidence of adverse events. Mean IOP at baseline was 24.8 mm Hg in each group. At follow-up visits, mean reductions from baseline ranged from 8.5 to 9.0 mm Hg with brimP/bim and from 7.5 to 7.7 mm Hg with tim/latan. More patients achieved low target pressures with brimP/bim. At week 12, 69.2% of brimP/bim patients and 27.3% of tim/latan patients had IOPs of 16 mm Hg or lower (P = .024). Both regimens were well tolerated, and adverse events were infrequent. The combination of brimonidine Purite and bimatoprost was well tolerated and at least as effective as Timoptic-XE and latanoprost in reducing IOP. More patients achieved low target IOPs with brimonidine Purite and bimatoprost than with Timoptic-XE and latanoprost. A larger study is needed to confirm these results.", 
    "93": "We studied the influence of the inflammatory state of the gallbladder with gallstones on its response to cholecystokinin (CCK). Responses to CCK were evaluated in isolated human gallbladder strips incubated with pharmacological antagonists. Gallbladders from patients with gallstones were classified as having mild and severe chronic cholecystitis. Healthy gallbladders were collected from liver donors. In donor gallbladders, the CCK contraction was abolished with the CCK-A receptor antagonist, L-364718, and significantly reduced by indomethacin. In gallbladders with gallstones, only mild cholecystitis showed a decreased contraction to CCK. In gallbladders with gallstones, no involvement of prostaglandins in the CCK response was observed. In severe cholecystitis, CCK contractile effect was reduced by the serotonin receptor antagonist methysergide. In healthy gallbladder, the contraction provoked by CCK is mediated by CCK-A receptors and modulated by prostaglandins. The presence of gallstones in the gallbladder is correlated with a loss of prostaglandins-modulated CCK contraction. However, the excessive release of serotonin in advanced cholecystitis normalizes the contraction to CCK, suggesting that the state of cholecystitis affects the pool of inflammatory mediators responsible for gallbladder CCK-altered motility.", 
    "94": "A new type of quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer, Q TRAP trade mark LC/MS/MS system (Q TRAP trade mark ), was evaluated for its performance in two studies: firstly, the in vitro metabolism of gemfibrozil in human liver microsomes, and, secondly, the quantification of propranolol in rat plasma. With the built-in information-dependent-acquisition (IDA) software, the instrument utilizes full scan MS in the ion trap mode and/or constant neutral loss scans as survey scans to trigger product ion scan (MS(2)) and MS(3) experiments to obtain structural information of drug metabolites 'on-the-fly'. Using this approach, five metabolites of gemfibrozil were detected in a single injection. This instrument combines some of the unique features of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, such as constant neutral loss scan, precursor ion scan and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), together with the capability of a three-dimensional ion trap. Therefore, it becomes a powerful instrument for metabolite identification. The fast duty cycle in the ion trap mode allows the use of full product ion scan for quantification. For the quantification of propranolol, both MRM mode and full product ion scan in the ion trap mode were employed. Similar sensitivity, reproducibility and linearity values were established using these two approaches. The use of the product ion scan mode for quantification provided a convenient tool in selecting transitions for improving selectivity during the method development stage.",

Coronary glucose and lactate transmyocardial gradients were similar in both groups, indicating adequate myocardial perfusion in all patients at all times. In addition, during retrograde cardioplegia, esmolol showed a lower nitric oxide release compared with that caused by potassium (39 +/- 49 micro mol x L(-1) for potassium vs 14 +/- 8 micro mol x L(-1) for esmolol at 10 minutes and 39 +/- 47 micro mol x L(-1) for potassium vs 6 +/- 8 micro mol x L(-1) for esmolol at 30 minutes, P =.05).

Activation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) after ischemia and reperfusion is considered one of the mechanisms responsible for such abnormalities. The present study investigates the influence of iron-dependent LPO inhibitor deferoxamine (DFO) on the cerebral perfusion after prolonged CA and resuscitation. Fourteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 17 minutes of CA, induced by esmolol (an ultrashort-acting beta-blocker) and apnea, followed by resuscitation by retrograde intraaortic infusion of oxygenated donor blood mixed with a resuscitation cocktail inside a vertical-bore 9.4-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet. Animals were randomized double-blindly into two groups to receive DFO or saline, respectively. Cerebral perfusion was measured by MRI continuously using the arterial spin-labeling method before, during, and after CA. All animals were successfully resuscitated in 1.36 +/- 0.04 minutes with well-controlled arrest time (17.99 +/- 0.03 minutes) in both groups. Deferoxamine significantly increased cerebral perfusion in hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, but not in cortex, during the first 20 minutes of reperfusion. In the DFO-treated group, the neurologic deficit score was significantly better (400 +/- 30 vs. 250 +/- 47, out of 500 as the best, P < 0.05) and weight loss was significantly less (33 +/- 6 vs. 71 +/- 19 g, P < 0.05) 5 d after arrest. The finding supports the notion that early reperfusion immediately after resuscitation is important for long-term outcome and that LPO may be involved in microvascular disorders during the reperfusion, particularly in the brain after prolonged cardiac arrest and resuscitation.", 
    "104": "The small GTPase RhoA is involved in the regulation of various cellular functions like the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and the induction of transcriptional activity. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are able to activate Gq/G11 and G12/G13 are major upstream regulators of RhoA activity, and G12/G13 have been shown to couple GPCRs to the activation of Rho by regulating the activity of a subfamily of RhoGEF proteins. However, the possible contribution of Gq/G11 to the regulation of RhoA activity via GPCRs is controversial. We have used a genetic approach to study the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins in the activation of RhoA via endogenous GPCRs. In pertussis toxin-treated Galpha12/Galpha13-deficient as well as in Galphaq/Galpha11-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), in which coupling of receptors is restricted to Gq/G11 and G12/G13, respectively, receptor activation results in Rho activation. Rho activation induced by receptor agonists via Gq/G11 occurs with lower potency than Rho activation via G12/G13. Activation of RhoA via Gq/G11 is not affected by the phospholipase-C blocker U73122 or the Ca2+-chelator BAPTA, but can be blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of the RhoGEF protein LARG. Our data clearly show that G12/G13 as well as Gq/G11 alone can couple GPCRs to the rapid activation of RhoA. Gq/G11-mediated RhoA activation occurs independently of phospholipase C-beta and appears to involve LARG.",

Compared with control patients, atenolol-treated patients experienced improved postoperative physical well-being, which paralleled the previously reported faster recovery from anesthesia and a decreased need for perioperative analgesics. Improved postoperative physical well-being of atenolol-treated patients was specifically caused by an ameliorated bodily pain score, a major component of the physical composite score of the SF-36 questionnaire.

Three tetanization paradigms were used: a relatively weak protocol A (10 bursts of 15 biphasic pulses at 200 Hz; 10-s interburst interval; 0.2-ms pulse width per phase), a stronger protocol B (as protocol A but 20 bursts and 0.25-ms pulse width) and, as the strongest condition, protocol C (2 times protocol B; inter-tetanus interval: 5 min). All protocols led to robust late-LTP in control animals. Late- but not early-LTP was protein synthesis-dependent under all tetanization conditions as indicated by the absence of long-lasting LTP when the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin was applied before tetanization. Application of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol before LTP induction prevented late-LTP when either protocol A or B but not when protocol C was used. Thus, repeated strong tetanization can compensate for the loss of beta-adrenergic receptor activation. We suggest that the results could provide a link to cellular mechanisms of memory consolidation in respect to the strength and relevance of the incoming sensory information during learning.",

In comparison, the pentapeptide FSPWG-amide was a full agonist with greatly reduced potency while SPWG-amide and PWG-amide were weak partial agonists. Substitution of individual amino acids in Hez KI with alanine revealed that replacement of the [phenylalanine(2)] residue caused a large fall in potency while replacement of [tryptophan(5)] residue caused complete loss of myogenic activity. The striking fall in potency of YASPWG-amide and the lack of activity of YFSPAG-amide confirm the requirement for aromatic groups in positions 2 and 3 of the core pentapeptide as well as supporting the ideas that the active core of these peptides adopts a beta-turn when interacting with receptors, bringing together the [Phe] and [Trp] residues that are critical for activity. Neither the pentapeptide proctolin nor the potent mammalian gut contractant Substance P were able to cause contraction when applied to caterpillar gut tissue. Incubation of isolated gut tissue in the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline (10-100&mgr;M) caused significant potentiation of the response to applied Hez KI. Conversely, in the presence of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil (10&mgr;M-1mM) or Co(2+) (1-50mM) the contractile effects of Hez KI were attentuated significantly. These data suggest that the gut of S. frugiperda contains G-protein-linked kinin receptors that utilise cyclic AMP as their second messenger system and cause contraction by promoting the entry of extracellular Ca(2+).",

    "159": "Management of hypertension in people with kidney disease is challenging and generally requires at least three different and complementary acting antihypertensive agents to achieve the recommended blood pressure goal by the JNC VI and WHO guidelines of <130/85 mmHg. This is also true for the recent blood pressure goal for diabetes of <130/80 mmHg recommended by both the National Kidney Foundation and American Diabetes Association for reduction of cardiovascular risk and preservation of kidney function. Commonly used combinations include an ACE inhibitor, which has compelling indications for use in people with kidney disease with a diuretic, generally a thiazide type agent. Angiotensin receptor blockers have clearly shown effectiveness for slowing nephropathy progression in Type 2 diabetes and clearly have a role as first-line agents in that disease. If additional therapy is required, either a beta blocker or calcium antagonist may be added to this antihypertensive 'cocktail'. Beta blockers are particularly effective in people with a high sympathetic drive, i.e. high pulse rates, to lower pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk. Moreover, in recent studies their benefits on kidney function both by reducing proteinuria and slowing decline of kidney function make them good agents to add in the appropriate clinical setting. Given recent data from an analysis of the NHANES III database showing only 11% of people being treated for hypertension with diabetic kidney disease have achieved the blood pressure goal of <130/85 mmHg, it's no wonder the incidence of people starting dialysis continues to climb. Physicians need to work harder and educate patients on the importance of achieving these lower blood pressure guidelines.", 
    "160": "Acute hypoxia increases heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (Qt) at a given oxygen consumption (VO2) during submaximal exercise. It is widely believed that the underlying mechanism involves increased sympathetic activation and circulating catecholamines acting on cardiac beta receptors. Recent evidence indicating a continued role for parasympathetic modulation of HR during moderate exercise suggests that increased parasympathetic withdrawal plays a part in the increase in HR and Qt during hypoxic exercise. To test this, we separately blocked the beta-sympathetic and parasympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in six healthy subjects (five male, one female; mean +/- S.E.M. age = 31.7+/-1.6 years, normoxic maximal VO2 (VO2,max)=3.1+/-0.3 l min(-1)) during exercise in conditions of normoxia and acute hypoxia (inspired oxygen fraction=0.125) to VO2,max. Data were collected on different days under the following conditions: (1)control, (2) after 8.0 mg propranolol i.v. and (3) after 0.8 mg glycopyrrolate i.v. Qt was measured using open-circuit acetylene uptake. Hypoxia increased venous [adrenaline] and [noradrenaline] but not [dopamine] at a given VO2 (P<0.05, P<0.01 and P=0.2, respectively). HR/VO2 and Qt/VO2 increased during hypoxia in all three conditions (P<0.05). Unexpectedly, the effects of hypoxia on HR and Qt were not significantly different from control with either beta-sympathetic or parasympathetic inhibition. These data suggest that although acute exposure to hypoxia increases circulating [catecholamines], the effects of hypoxia on HR and Qt do not necessarily require intact cardiac muscarinic and beta receptors. It may be that cardiac alpha receptors play a primary role in elevating HR and Qt during hypoxic exercise, or perhaps offer an alternative mechanism when other ANS pathways are blocked.", 
    "161": "Prolonged cardiac repolarization causes fatal cardiac arrhythmias. There is evidence that these contribute to sudden death associated with nocturnal hypoglycemia in young people with diabetes. We measured cardiac repolarization (QT interval [QTc] and QT dispersion [QTd]) during experimental hypoglycemia with and without beta-blockade and potassium infusion to establish possible mechanisms. Two groups of 10 nondiabetic men (study 1 and study 2) each underwent four hyperinsulinemic clamps: two euglycemic (5 mmol/l) and two hypoglycemic (5 mmol/l and 2.5 mmol/l for 60 min each). Study 1 was performed with and without potassium infusion to maintain normal concentrations and study 2 with and without beta-blockade (atenolol, 100 mg/day for 7 days). QTd was unchanged during euglycemia but increased during hypoglycemia (55 ms, P < 0.0001 vs. baseline), which was prevented by potassium (6 ms, P = 0.78). QTc increased significantly during hypoglycemia alone (67 ms, P < 0.0001) and during potassium replacement (46 ms, P = 0.02). In study 2, the increase in QTd during hypoglycemia (68 ms, P < 0.0001) was prevented by beta-blockade (3 ms, P = 0.88). The increase in QTc during hypoglycemia (55 ms, P < 0.0001) was prevented by beta-blockade (1 ms, P = 0.98). Our data indicate that hypoglycemia causes an acquired long QT syndrome. Sympathoadrenal stimulation is the main cause, through mechanisms that involve but are not limited to catecholamine-mediated hypokalemia. These abnormalities are prevented by selective beta-blockade.",

We recorded the surface ECG, monophasic action potential (MAP) and left ventricular pressure (LVP) in the canine beating heart. Alternans was induced with an abrupt shortening of the cycle length from 1000 to 350 ms. After the control studies, we administered propranolol or isoproterenol. In the presence of propranolol, we administered milrinone or 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS). In the presence of isoproterenol, we administered thapsigargin. Isoproterenol and milrinone attenuated both the electrical and mechanical alternans. Thapsigargin, a specific SR Ca(2+) pump inhibitor, and propranolol magnified both types of alternans. DIDS, a Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) current (I(Cl(Ca))) inhibitor, attenuated the MAP alternans without an affect on the LVP alternans. Thus, the delayed intracellular Ca(2+) cycling caused by the impaired SR Ca(2+) pump function might produce electrical and mechanical alternans. beta-adrenergic stimulation eliminated these alternans. The I(Cl(Ca)) contributed to the appearance of the electrical alternans.",

P-wave maximum duration (PWM) and P-wave dispersion (PWD) are recent ECG markers and reflect increased risk of AF. The aim of our study was to investigate the long-term effects of metoprolol on atrial conduction abnormalities as estimated by PWM and PWD, which were calculated on 12-derivation surface ECG in heart failure patients. Forty-two NYHA class 3 to 4 patients (23 males, 19 females and aged 52.9 +/- 11.2) were enrolled in the study. At the end of the 6 months, PWM and PWD values were significantly decreased (for PWM: from 115.2 +/- 12.6 to 105.4 +/- 13.5; for PWD: from 39.3 +/- 9.1 to 28.6 +/- 10.5; P <.001 for both). Metoprolol treatment is associated with a decreased duration of PWM and PWD and this may reflect a reduction in the probability of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients.", 
    "164": "Nateglinide is a short-acting, pancreatic, beta-cell-selective, K(ATP) potassium channel blocker that improves overall glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Although nateglinide's mechanism of action is related to that of sulphonyl-ureas and repaglinide, important differences do exist. Nateglinide binds rapidly to the sulfonylurea SUR1 receptor with a relatively low affinity, and it dissociates from it extremely rapidly in a manner of seconds. This rapid association and dissociation gives nateglinide a unique \"fast on-fast off\" effect. Thus, nateglinide has a rapid onset and short duration of action stimulating insulin secretion in vivo and providing good control of postprandial hyperglycemia when taken immediately prior to meals. The rapid action of nateglinide on the beta cells stimulates and restores the normal physiological first and early phase of insulin secretion, consequently reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. This hypoglycemic effect of nateglinide leads to improved glycemic control, while the short duration avoids delayed hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia after meals. Nateglinide is not a sulfonylurea, but it shares the mechanism of action of commonly used oral hypoglycemic agents such as glibenclamide and glipizide. Like the recently introduced, short-acting agent, repaglinide, it does not incorporate a sulfonylurea moiety. However, nateglinide's effects on insulin secretion and glycemic control differ significantly from the sulfonylureas and repaglinide in that it preferentially stimulates acute phase insulin, better controls postprandial glucose excursions and spikes, and causes less hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Compounds with such a profile should not only achieve improved overall glucose control, but also reduce the risk of vascular complications which is the most important feature of nateglinide. Clinical studies with nateglinide have confirmed that it acts rapidly and both restores insulin release and attenuates the postprandial glucose spike. Nateglinide is both effective and well tolerated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The reported overall profile of adverse effects appears to be superior to that of other K(ATP) potassium channel blockers, the glucose modulator metformin and PPARgamma agonists such as troglitazone. Clinical comparisons of these agents have shown nateglinide to be more effective in attenuating postprandial glucose than any other oral hypoglycemic agent, and that treatment with both nateglinide and metformin provides additive effects that afford improved control of plasma glucose levels. The administration regimen for nateglinide, immediately prior to meals, also facilitates patient compliance. (c) 2001 Prous Science. All rights reserved.", 
    "165": "Phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB) at Ser16 (protein kinase A site) and at Thr17 [Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) site] increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake and myocardial contractility and relaxation. In perfused rat hearts submitted to ischemia-reperfusion, we previously showed an ischemia-induced Ser16 phosphorylation that was dependent on beta-adrenergic stimulation and an ischemia and reperfusion-induced Thr17 phosphorylation that was dependent on Ca2+ influx. To elucidate the relationship between these two PLB phosphorylation sites and postischemic mechanical recovery, rat hearts were submitted to ischemia-reperfusion in the absence and presence of the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (1 microM) or the beta-adrenergic blocker dl-propranolol (1 microM). KN-93 diminished the reperfusion-induced Thr17 phosphorylation and depressed the recovery of contraction and relaxation after ischemia. dl-Propranolol decreased the ischemia-induced Ser16 phosphorylation but failed to modify the contractile recovery. To obtain further insights into the functional role of the two PLB phosphorylation sites in postischemic mechanical recovery, transgenic mice expressing wild-type PLB (PLB-WT) or PLB mutants in which either Thr17 or Ser16 were replaced by Ala (PLB-T17A and PLB-S16A, respectively) into the PLB-null background were used. Both PLB mutants showed a lower contractile recovery than PLB-WT. However, this recovery was significantly impaired all along reperfusion in PLB-T17A, whereas it was depressed only at the beginning of reperfusion in PLB-S16A. Moreover, the recovery of relaxation was delayed in PLB-T17A, whereas it did not change in PLB-S16A, compared with PLB-WT. These findings indicate that, although both PLB phosphorylation sites are involved in the mechanical recovery after ischemia, Thr17 appears to play a major role.", 
    "166": "Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are partly misused by males in order to become brave and intoxicated and these agents are highly associated with psychosis, disinhibition, aggression and acts of violence. Since such behavioral states have been related to an imbalanced serotonergic system and the involvement of the serotonergic 5HT(1B) and the 5HT(2) receptors, it was important to discern the impact of AAS on these receptors. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of 2 weeks of treatment with the AAS nandrolone decanoate at three different doses (1, 5, 15 mg/kg/day) on the total specific binding of the radioligands [(125)I]-(+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (5HT(2) receptors) by autoradiography. All doses caused a significant down-regulation of the 5HT(1B) receptor density in the hippocampal CA(1) and in the medial globus pallidus and a significant up-regulation of the 5HT(2) receptor density in the nucleus accumbens shell. Alterations in receptor density were also observed in the lateral globus pallidus, ventromedial hypothalamus, the amygdala and in the intermediate layers of various cortex regions. In conclusion, serotonergic 5HT(1B) or 5HT(2) receptors are likely to play important roles in mediating observed emotional states and behavioral changes among AAS abusers.",

The neurochemical analysis with local intrahypothalamic administration of anxiosedative and anxioselective substances showed that the antiaversive actions of Campirone are obtained only in conditions in which the dominant motivation is fear, while chlordiazepoxide, Phenibut, and Indoter are also active in anxiety induced by negatively stressful zoosocial influences; these actions are mediated respectively by serotoninergic and GABAergic types of synaptic switching in the ventromedial hypothalamus.",

Preoperative cardiac evaluation aims at assessing the patient's clinical risk profile in order to provide the more cost-effective strategy to reduce the risk of cardiac complications. Among different ways to reduce the incidence of perioperative cardiac complications, compelling evidence comes from the use of beta-blockers: in the absence of absolute contraindications, beta-blocker therapy should be administered to all patients at intermediate-high risk for coronary events who have to undergo noncardiac surgery. Even if the number of patients enrolled in these studies is relatively small, the use of beta-blockers before noncardiac surgery has been shown to be associated with a significant reduction in major cardiac events so that this therapy may reduce the need for additional noninvasive tests in some groups of patients. Coronary angiography and revascularization should have the same indications as if performed in the nonoperative setting.", 
    "170": "Previous work with 4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (CGP 12177) has led to the suggestion that there are two different agonist conformations of the human beta1-adrenoceptor: 1) where classic agonists (catecholamines) and beta-antagonists act, and 2) where CGP 12177 is an agonist and relatively resistant to inhibition by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. In the present study, we have used studies of cAMP response element-regulated gene transcription to confirm the presence of these two beta1-adrenoceptor sites/conformations and to provide strong evidence that a range of clinically used beta-adrenoceptor blockers (beta-blockers) exhibit differential agonists and/or antagonist actions at the two sites. [2-(3-Carbamoyl-4-hydroxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]-3-[4-(1-methyl-4-trifluormethyl-2-imidazolyl)-phenoxy]-2-propanolmethanesulphonate (CGP 20712A) and atenolol act as classic antagonists at the catecholamine binding site but have much lower affinity for the secondary CGP 12177 site. CGP 12177 and carvedilol are potent antagonists at the catecholamine site but mediate substantial agonist actions on gene transcription via the secondary antagonist-resistant site at higher concentrations. Agonist effects of beta-blockers are not, however, confined to this secondary site, and we show that some (particularly acebutolol and labetolol) act primarily via the catecholamine site, whereas others (pindolol and alprenolol) can stimulate both. The different responses to beta-blockers seen in the clinic may therefore be caused in part by these beta-blocker agonist responses and the differential activation of the two sites or conformations.",

We sent questionnaires to 1234 members of the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society. The overall response rate was 54%. Ninety-five percent of respondents were aware of the perioperative beta blocker literature, and of these, 93% agreed that beta blockers were beneficial in patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD). Fifty-seven percent reported always or usually administering prophylactic beta blockers in patients with known CAD, and 34% of these regular users continued therapy beyond the early postoperative period. Only 9% of respondents reported that a formal protocol existed at their facility. This study suggests that barriers to the translation of research to practice were not related to a lack of awareness of the current best evidence. With respect to perioperative beta blockers, controversies within the literature as well as practical considerations may be greater barriers to implementation of best evidence.",

However, the potential determinants of post-transplant beta-cell dysfunction are largely unknown. The objective of the present study was to address this issue in detail. A total of 167 previously nondiabetic renal transplant recipients underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)10 weeks after transplantation. Serum glucose and insulin were measured at 0, 1, and 2 hours. Three insulin release indices (Secr(AUC), Secr(1.phase), and Secr(2.phase)) were calculated to assess the insulin secretory response as the dependent variable. To account for variations in insulin sensitivity (IS), beta-cell function was also estimated as the disposition index (DI); the product of the IS index (ISI(TX)) and Secr(1.phase). Increasing age was strongly and independently associated with a blunted insulin secretory response even after adjustment for IS (P =.001). An 80-year-old recipient had an approximately 50% lower insulin release than a 20-year-old individual, based on the linear regression model. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease and treatment with furosemide were both independently associated with beta-cell dysfunction (DI; P <.001 and P =.008). Patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors had an enhanced absolute insulin release, but the DI was similar in both treated and untreated recipients. We conclude that older age is an important determinant of beta-cell dysfunction after renal transplantation. CMV disease and treatment with furosemide may also negatively influence pancreatic insulin release in renal transplant recipients.",

Long-term antihypertensive treatment is obligatory for hypertensive transplant patients, to protect allograft function. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the anti-hypertensive treatment of renal transplant recipients who receive immunosuppression with cyclosporine has long been discussed controversially. The aim of this prospective study, with a duration of 2 years and a follow-up of another 3 years, was to estimate the long-term antihypertensive potential of quinapril compared with that of the beta-blocker atenolol and to compare their effects on renal allograft function and proteinuria in 96 hypertensive renal transplant recipients who received cyclosporine A as immunosuppressive therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either quinapril (group Q) or atenolol (group A) as anti-hypertensive treatment. Forty patients of each group completed the 5-year observation period according to protocol. Intention-to-treat and according-to-protocol analyses were performed. With the patients starting at similar baseline blood pressure values, both agents, atenolol and quinapril, decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) as well as middle arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) to a similar extent (Delta SBP: group Q: -8+/-3 vs group A mmHg: -5+/-3; Delta DBP: -5+/-2 vs -4+/-2 mmHg; Delta MAP: -6+/-2 vs -5+/-2 mmHg; Delta PP: -2+/-2 vs -1+/-3 mmHg; mean +/- SEM). Neither serum creatinine levels nor Cockcroft-Gault clearance had changed significantly in either group after the 5-year period (Delta creatinine: 0.1+/-0.1 vs 0.2+/-0.2 mg/dl; Delta Cockcroft-Gault clearance: 3.9+/-4.6 vs 2.8+/-4.3 ml/min; mean +/- SEM). Urinary protein excretion remained stable among the quinapril-treated patients, whereas a significant increase was observed in the atenolol group during the 5-year study period (group Q: from 0.52+/-0.08 to 0.54+/-0.14 g/24 h; group A: from 0.34+/-0.03 to 0.72+/-0.13 g/24 h, P<0.02; mean +/- SEM). Albuminuria increased comparably in both groups, while the excretion of alpha-microglobuline increased slightly in the atenolol group, but decreased slightly in the quinapril group. The difference between the groups failed to be statistically significant (ANOVA, P<0.056). In conclusion, quinapril and atenolol may be considered suitable and safe substances in the long-term treatment of hypertensive renal transplant recipients, since both agents prove to be effective in anti-hypertensive treatment, and keep allograft function stable over a period of 5 years.",

Currently, we used short-term beta-adrenergic, 5-HT(1A), or 5-HT(2A/C) receptor blockade to characterize the influence of NE and 5-HT systems on BDNF transcription during physical exercise and antidepressant treatment. In situ hybridization revealed that beta-adrenergic blockade significantly blunted the BDNF mRNA elevations due to exercise, and also inhibited the modest elevations in the CA3 and dentate gyrus following short-term treatment with tranylcypromine. In contrast, 5-HT(2A/C) blockade only minimally altered exercise-induced BDNF mRNA levels, but inhibited up-regulation of BDNF transcription via tranylcypromine. Finally, 5-HT(1A) blockade did not inhibit exercise-induced BDNF mRNA elevations, but significantly enhanced levels above those achieved with exercise alone in the CA4. These results suggest that NE activation via beta-adrenergic receptors may be essential for both exercise and antidepressant-induced BDNF regulation. 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/C) activation, on the other hand, appear to be most important for antidepressant-induced BDNF regulation, but may also participate significantly in exercise-induced regulation in the CA4."
