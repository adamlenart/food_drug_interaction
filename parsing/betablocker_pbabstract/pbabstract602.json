These moieties inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis, in a dose-dependent fashion, when added in vitro to nuclei isolated from the liver of male or female rats. The inhibition is due to a decrease of the initial rate of synthesis and of the total amount of labeled precursor incorporated into the growing chains. When administered in vivo both the oncogenic ZAMI 1305 and its non-oncogenic isomer ZAMI 1327 inhibit hepatic DNA and RNA synthesis in female rats, as evaluated by the determination of nucleic acids synthesis in liver nuclei isolated from female rats 5 and 15 min after the injection of the drug. No influence on hepatic DNA and RNA synthesis is observed when the molecules are administered to male rats. The in vivo administration of DL-propranolol causes an increase of hepatic DNA and RNA synthesis in male rats, while it is uneffective in female rats.", 
    "1": "Bucindolol is a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that lowers blood pressure partly via direct vasodilation. We have investigated the mechanism of the antihypertensive action of bucindolol using the isolated perfused rat tail artery preparation. Bucindolol caused a parallel shift to the right of the dose-response curves for both serotonin (5-HT) and phenylephrine (PE), indicating competitive antagonism. The pA2 values were 5.9 +/- 0.2 (5-HT) and 7.18 +/- 0.10 (PE). The calculated potency ratio (PE:5-HT) was 19. Thus, bucindolol was found to have weak serotonin antagonist as well as alpha-adrenergic antagonist properties in addition to its documented beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties. This appears to be a novel combination of antagonist properties. Bucindolol also reduced the maximal response to 5-HT but had no effect on the maximal response to PE. In these respects, bucindolol acts similarly to prazosin (alpha-adrenoceptor blocker) and ketanserin (5-HT antagonist and alpha-adrenoceptor blocker). These results are consistent with our proposal that 5-HT receptors and alpha-adrenoceptors overlap on the cell surface, sharing common binding sites, such that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade causes interference with the full expression of 5-HT receptor stimulation.", 
    "2": "Seventeen subjects with essential hypertension (14 men, 3 women, 40-69 years of age), 13 of whom continued their previous antihypertensive therapy, completed a double-blind crossover trial of ketanserin 40 mg twice daily versus placebo tablets twice daily. Each treatment phase was 6 weeks in duration. For the group as a whole, blood pressure (BP) was reduced in the ketanserin phase compared with the placebo phase: supine mean BP decrease: 4 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.05); standing mean BP decrease: 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Heart rate (HR) was also significantly decreased in the ketanserin phase (5 +/- 1 beats/min) (p less than 0.001). When individual subgroups were analysed, the reductions in BP and HR were greater in subjects already receiving antihypertensive therapy, diuretics, and/or beta-adrenergic blockers. Changes were observed in 24-h urine sodium and potassium excretion: Sodium (mmol/day): placebo 137 +/- 17, ketanserin 174 +/- 19 (p less than 0.05); potassium (mmol/day): placebo 74 +/- 8, ketanserin 57 +/- 5. For the group as a whole, there were no significant adverse effects during the ketanserin phase, although two subjects had a dose reduction of ketanserin because of drowsiness and dizziness. Two additional subjects withdrew from the study owing to adverse effects, one in the placebo phase. In conclusion, ketanserin in the dose administered has a modest hypotensive effect, which is best seen in subjects already receiving other antihypertensive agents.", 
    "3": "The antihypertensive effect of ketanserin in combination with beta-adrenergic blockade was assessed in a double-blind crossover (4 weeks) manner in 10 patients with essential hypertension. The addition of ketanserin (40 mg b.i.d.) to optimal doses of beta-adrenergic blockers had significant antihypertensive effects compared with treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers alone. When followed for 24 h at steady-state conditions, ketanserin effectively reduced the blood pressure during a major part of the day, with maximal effect occurring at the time of the peak plasma concentration of ketanserin (1-2 h after tablet intake). Six patients initially reported a slight sedation during ketanserin treatment.", 
    "4": "In 10 patients with primary arterial hypertension of mild or moderate degree, ketanserin, a competitive antagonist of serotonin receptors, was given for a period of 4 weeks, 40 mg twice daily. In a control group, patients were given 100 mg twice daily of metoprolol for 4 weeks for each treatment. A randomized double-blind crossover model was used. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during exercise testing on a bicycle; peripheral blood flow was measured by strain-gauge plethysmography. A slight reduction in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure without change in heart rate was observed during treatment with ketanserin. Cardiac workload during exercise test did not change over the observation period. A slight increase in resting blood flow to the lower limbs, with a decrease in peripheral resistance was demonstrated by strain-gauge plethysmography.", 
    "5": "Ketanserin is a serotonin (S2) blocker that reduces blood pressure (BP) in patients with essential hypertension preferentially by a reduction of peripheral vascular resistance. Heart rate is generally not affected or slightly reduced. When given in monotherapy on a 40 mg b.i.d. regimen, ketanserin reduces diastolic BP as effectively as metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. or hydrochlorotiazide 25 mg b.i.d. The incidence of adverse reactions is low and comparable to these reference drugs. A satisfactory BP control is provided over a 24-h interval on a 40 mg b.i.d. dosage schedule, and the effect is maintained on a long-term basis, i.e., greater than 2 years. The response seems to be more marked in older patients, which may be due to an augmented platelet serotonin release and a vascular hypersensitivity in this age group. The future usefulness of ketanserin, as well as any other antihypertensive agent, will depend on its ability to prevent organ damage, as well as its ability to provide \"quality of life\" for the patient.", 
    "6": "This double-blind study, which is still in progress, aims to compare ketanserin (K) and propranolol (P) during long-term treatment of hypertensive patients in general practice. After a run-in period on placebo, active treatment was initiated with 20 mg K or 40 mg P, b.i.d., during a 2-week period, whereafter the daily dose of either drug was doubled. Presently, 331 patients have been randomized, two-thirds to the K group (n = 221) and one-third to the P group (n = 110). Both groups were similar at randomization, with blood pressure (BP) averaging 171/105 mm Hg. The presently available data concerning the initial 3 months of the trial show that up to the 2nd month after randomization, systolic BP was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher in the K than in the P group, whereas the differences in diastolic BP were mostly not significant. The change in BP after 3 months on K treatment was positively and independently related to both the initial BP and the concurrent changes in body weight. Heart rate was lower (p less than 0.001) during P, whereas body weight was not statistically different between both groups. Differences in complaints between the K and P group were small. However, in the K group dry mouth was transiently more frequently reported at 1 month (p = 0.02) and multiple complaints at 3 months (p = 0.03).", 
    "7": "Captopril given for 5 days to normotensive subjects caused a significant fall in blood pressure. The fall in blood pressure was greater on a low sodium diet (19.6%) and less on a high sodium diet (11%) whereas on a normal sodium intake it was 16.5%. This fall in blood pressure was related to the initial level of angiotensin II and the fall in angiotensin II and was also associated with large falls in plasma aldosterone and, on the normal sodium intake, a loss of sodium that amounted to approximately 140 mmol/normal subject studied over the 5 days. Patients with essential hypertension who were studied on their normal diets had a similar fall in blood pressure for a given plasma renin activity. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are therefore used in hypertension not because they are specific for patients with high blood pressure but because they are effective in lowering blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive subjects and cause few side effects. They are also particularly effective when used in conjunction with sodium restriction, diuretics, or calcium entry antagonists but less effective when combined with a beta-blocker.", 
    "8": "The complementary antihypertensive effects of the beta-blocker/calcium antagonist combination has to be weighed against their additive and potentially detrimental negative inotropic, chronotropic, and dromotropic effects inherent in both classes of drugs. We reviewed the main adversity, particularly electrophysiological and hemodynamic effects, of combined treatments with beta-blockers and the calcium antagonists verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. In patients with coronary artery disease, a different picture emerged between the verapamil and nifedipine combination with a beta-blocker. Verapamil was more often associated with conduction problems (up to 9%) and dyspnea or heart failure (up to 8%). These problems had rarely been reported with nifedipine but ankle edema (up to 11%), flushing (up to 11%), and headaches (up to 7%) predominated. The cardiovascular unwanted effects led to withdrawal in 5-8% for the verapamil/beta-blocker or nifedipine/beta-blocker combination. Although there was little cardiac adversity with the nifedipine/beta-blocker combination, the intravenous administration of verapamil in patients on beta-blockers is contraindicated and the oral verapamil/beta-blocker combination should not be sought in patients with impaired left ventricular function and when conduction disturbances are likely to occur. In treating hypertensive patients without overt coronary artery disease, there is no argument against the use of the nifedipine/beta-blocker combination but there is a need for definitive studies of the verapamil/beta-blocker combination.", 
    "9": "More than 20 years ago calcium antagonists were shown to lower elevated blood pressure. Today's worldwide recognition, at least in part, is due to rising research interest in cellular ion regulation abnormalities in essential hypertension. Using the human platelet as a model for the vascular smooth muscle cell, a direct relationship was observed between intracellular free calcium concentration and the height of blood pressure before as well as during different antihypertensive treatments. Calcium influx is an important determinant of vasoconstriction, and excess calcium influx-dependent vasoconstriction was shown with plethysmographical studies in patients with essential hypertension. Calcium antagonists acutely lower blood pressure by reducing intracellular calcium and peripheral vascular resistance. The degree of the attendant sympathetic nerve reflex activation and counterregulatory mechanisms codetermine the antihypertensive result of the individual. Chronic monotherapy with calcium antagonists results in an antihypertensive response that is related directly to the patient's age and pretreatment blood pressure and indirectly to renin. These studies led to a new treatment concept: calcium antagonists can be used as alternatives to diuretic drugs primarily in the older and low-renin patients and beta-blockers or converting enzyme inhibitors can be used in the younger or high-renin patients with greater efficacy. With the appropriate choice, calcium antagonists alone or combined with any other antihypertensive drug provide good blood pressure control with little subjective and objective adverse effects.", 
    "10": "Calcium entry blockers or calcium antagonists have been recognized as useful antihypertensive drugs, although their definite position in the management of hypertensive disease remains to be established. The present survey deals with the pharmacological basis of their antihypertensive action, side effects, contraindications, and interactions with other drugs. The antihypertensive effect of the various calcium entry blockers is fully explained by arteriolar dilatation, thus leading to a reduction in total peripheral resistance. At a cellular level this effect is assumed to be induced by the selective inhibition of the slow inward current that is carried by calcium ion fluxes. Furthermore, the interaction with vascular postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction may also contribute to vasodilatation.", 
    "11": "The effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) and haemodynamics of two beta-blockers, arotinolol and timolol, administered topically to the eye, were studied in 6 healthy volunteers in a cross-over trial. 0.5% timolol or 0.5% arotinolol ophthalmic solutions drop was instilled in both eyes of the volunteers at an interval of 48 hours. Timolol lowered IOP by about 31.9% 1 hour after administration and the effect continued until 3 h, whilst arotinolol lowered it significantly 2 h after instillation and the same maximum effect as that of timolol was obtained after 3 h. Arotinolol was detected in blood in all subject and timolol in blood in one subject, although it was found in all subjects in urine. Both drugs lowered heart rate at rest and attenuated the increase in the double product (products of blood pressure and heart rate) at exercise. The effect of timolol on the double products was larger. Thus, arotinolol and timolol decreased IOP to similar extent, although the maximal effect of arotinolol was delayed. Arotinolol as well as timolol affected haemodynamics through absorption into circulation, but the former had less effect on haemodynamics during exercise.", 
    "12": "This manuscript summarizes the effects of cardiac sympathetic nerve activation on coronary blood flow and myocardial function, metabolism, and morphology distal to stenoses. Whereas cardiac sympathetic nerve activation induces an increase in myocardial function and metabolism accompanied by metabolic coronary dilation under physiological conditions, this response is different in the presence of coronary stenoses. With decreasing coronary hyperemic reserve, distal to an increasing degree of coronary stenosis, the predominant response to sympathetic stimulation is continuously shifted from metabolic dilation to alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. With a severe coronary stenosis, both electrical stimulation of cardiac sympathetic nerves and reflex sympathetic activation by carotid occlusion induce poststenotic vasoconstriction and ischemia of the dependent myocardium. Poststenotic vasoconstriction is mediated by vascular alpha 2-adrenoceptors and is prevented by phentolamine, rauwolscine, and nifedipine. Prolonged sympathetic activation even results in patchy subendocardial necroses. There is a vicious cycle between poststenotic vasoconstriction, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac sympathetic nerve activity that results in a progressive perfusion impairment during 20 min severe coronary stenosis.", 
    "13": "The presence of specific binding sites for tritiated CGP-12177, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, was investigated in the preneoplastic-like C1I cell-line and in Morris hepatoma MH3924 cells. It was found that C1I cells possess beta-adrenoceptors with the following characteristics: KD = 1.58 +/- 0.56 nM and Bmax = 4.41 +/- 0.88 fmol/10(6) cells. No specific binding sites could be found on MH3924 cells. Stimulation of the C1I cells beta-adrenoceptors by isoprenaline, salbutamol, adrenaline and noradrenaline induced cyclic AMP accumulation. Noradrenaline was, however, a hundred times less efficient than adrenaline, as is the case in normal rat hepatocytes. The order of potency of beta-antagonists either to displace the bound radioligand or to counteract isoprenaline induced cyclic AMP accumulation (IPS-339 greater than propranolol much greater than atenolol) indicates that the adrenoceptors present on the C1I cells are of the beta 2-subtype.", 
    "14": "Responses to vagal stimulation, acetylcholine, catecholamines, and sympathetic nerve stimulation were investigated in the feline pulmonary vascular bed under conditions of controlled pulmonary blood flow and constant left atrial pressure. Results of these studies suggest that, in the cat, the vagus is composed of efferent fibers from both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The data also suggest that the feline pulmonary vascular bed is functionally innervated by cholinergic nerves, and that vagal stimulation dilates the pulmonary vascular bed by releasing acetylcholine, which acts on muscarinic receptors in pulmonary vessels. alpha and beta 2-adrenoceptors appear to be present in the feline pulmonary vascular bed, and both types of adrenergic receptors are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system. Selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor agonists produce pulmonary vasoconstrictor responses, suggesting the presence of both alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor subtypes in the feline pulmonary vascular bed. The pulmonary vascular response to norepinephrine, dopamine, and dobutamine is the algebraic summation of activation of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Dopamine possesses greater alpha-(vasoconstrictor) activity when compared to dobutamine, whereas dobutamine has greater beta-(vasodilator) activity.", 
    "15": "Beta-blocking drugs were specifically introduced for the treatment of exercise-induced angina pectoris. Their therapeutic utility in this specific presentation of coronary insufficiency is undoubted. However, since they were introduced, evolution of the pathological, haemodynamic, and electrophysiological understanding of the disease syndrome has undergone considerable reappraisal, in no small measure owing to the physiological tool that these drugs have furnished. Their influence on the various aspects of the syndrome of exercise-induced ischaemic myocardial pain is widely known. The physiological conflict posed by unopposed blockade of one sympathetic outflow pathway remains the source of many of their clinical disadvantages. Many important questions directly related to their therapeutic use remain unanswered. The potential benefits and hazards of their long-term administration in patients with advanced coronary heart disease remains to be established.", 
    "16": "Studies on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), which represent a model of genetically determined arterial hypertension, revealed that cardiac hypertrophy can be controlled by blood pressure normalization by use of various antihypertensive drugs such as hydralazine, captopril, metoprolol, guanethidine, and alpha-methyldopa. Adrenergic influences seem to play a part except for left ventricular (LV) systolic unloading on cardiac hypertrophy, because LV hypertrophy was quantitatively less expressed after a combined therapy with both metoprolol and hydralazine than after a single hydralazine treatment, although blood pressure was not different between the groups. To study whether nifedipine can cause an already existing cardiac hypertrophy to regress, 20-week-old SHR were treated with nifedipine for a period of 20 weeks. After nifedipine treatment, LV muscle mass/body weight ratio was significantly less than before therapy (2.13 +/- 0.18 vs. 2.37 +/- 0.30 mg/g; p less than 0.05). Mass to volume ratio, i.e., quotient of LV muscle mass and LV end-diastolic volume, dropped from 3.40 +/- 0.66 to 3.07 +/- 0.30 mg/microliters (p less than 0.05) after therapy. Accordingly, an antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine can cause an already existing LV hypertrophy in SHR to regress. Because blood pressure reduction resulting from therapy with beta-receptor-blockers, vasodilators, sympatholytic drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers has qualitatively similar effects with respect to causing regression of hypertrophy, reversal of cardiac hypertrophy seems to be mainly related to the reduced LV systolic load. Specific pharmacodynamic effects may only modulate the extent of LV mass reduction along with blood pressure normalization.", 
    "17": "We examined the effect of three antihypertensive agents with differing modes of action on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma catecholamines, plasma renin activity, and echocardiographic left ventricular mass. Twenty-six patients were studied; nine were treated with nifedipine, a calcium antagonist, nine were treated with timolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, and eight were treated with indapamide, a diuretic with some probable calcium antagonist properties. All drugs reduced blood pressure satisfactorily; the reduction of systolic blood pressure was not significantly different among the three drugs, but timolol reduced diastolic blood pressure by a greater amount than did either indapamide or nifedipine. Left ventricular (LV) mass was reduced equally by all three drugs. However, there were markedly different effects on the other parameters measured. Heart rate was reduced to a greater extent by timolol than by the other two drugs. Plasma renin activity was reduced by timolol, unchanged by nifedipine, and increased by indapamide. There were no significant changes in either adrenaline or noradrenaline with any of the three drugs. We conclude that these data do not support the hypothesis that the sympathetic nervous system is primarily responsible for left ventricular hypertrophy, and suggest that reduction of left ventricular mass with antihypertensive agents is not the property of any one class of drug.", 
    "18": "Calcium antagonists induce vasodilation and a consequent fall in blood pressure that initially is associated with baroreflex-mediated stimulation of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin system, resulting in increased heart rate and cardiac output. During chronic treatment, baroreflex-mediated stimulatory effects subside, probably because of a resetting of baroreflexes or inhibition of neuronal noradrenaline release. Ultimately, the antihypertensive response is codetermined by the responsiveness of these counterregulatory systems in the individual patient. In older patients who have blunted baroreflex and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated functions, a greater fall in blood pressure results as compared with younger patients in whom counterregulatory reflexes are more vivid. Therefore, older patients respond particularly well to calcium antagonists, whereas younger patients respond better to beta-blockers. In patients with essential hypertension, free cytosolic calcium concentration in platelets is elevated and calcium influx-dependent vasoconstriction is enhanced. Antihypertensive treatment with calcium antagonists and beta-blockers results in a normalization of both calcium influx-dependent vasoconstriction as well as free calcium concentration in platelets. Free cytosolic calcium concentration in platelets may reflect free calcium concentration in vascular smooth muscle cells, its reduction leading to vasodilation and antihypertensive response.", 
    "19": "Several drugs used for antihypertensive therapy may interact with lipoprotein metabolism and may increase associated coronary risk levels. beta-Blocker monotherapy with selective or nonselective beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) usually increases serum triglyceride and decreases high-density lipoprotein (HDL), especially HDL2 cholesterol concentration. With the exception of the nonselective beta-blocker sotalol, beta-blocker therapy has little influence on the serum total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. The magnitude of these changes in serum lipids did not distinctly differ between selective and nonselective beta-blockers. Two beta-blockers possessing ISA, acebutolol, and pindolol did not show the increase in serum triglycerides and in serum total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. Acebutolol showed the nonsignificant decrease in HDL cholesterol level. Pindolol with marked ISA exhibited the most favorable lipid profile, increasing serum HDL cholesterol and the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol. The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I increased slightly during pindolol therapy. beta-Blockers with the exception of pindolol decrease the concentration of serum free fatty acids. beta-blocker therapy has little influence on the adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity, but lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase activity may increase during pindolol therapy.", 
    "20": "Arotinolol (S-596, ARL) is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with weak alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity, and may be classified into the fourth generation. Antihypertensive effects of ARL were studied for 12 weeks in spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Propranolol (PPL) was used as the reference drug. ARL (20 and 100 mg/kg per day, p.o.) and PPL (100 mg/kg per day, p.o.) treatments significantly decreased heart rate, within a week after the drug treatments had started and thereafter. Tail blood pressure (BP), determined by prewarming the rat at 50 degrees C for 3 min, was slightly higher in the two ARL treated groups than in the control. Tail BP was slightly lower in the PPL treated group than in the control. Mean BP determined directly at the 12th week was lower in the two ARL and PPL groups than in the control by more than 20 mmHg. Both ARL (100 mg/kg per day) and PPL (100 mg/kg per day) treatments significantly reduced incidences of the vascular lesions, and also prevented the decrease of kidney weights usually associated with mild vascular lesions. Furthermore, these treatments showed a tendency to decrease plasma renin (PRC) and aldosterone (PAC) concentrations determined 20 h after the last administration. As mean BP must be more reliable than tail BP, it was concluded that ARL (20 and 100 mg/kg per day) showed almost the same chronic antihypertensive activity in SHR rats as PPL (100 mg/kg per day). Preventive effects of ARL on development of vascular lesions also supported the above view.", 
    "21": "The acute electrophysiologic effects of clinical doses of procainamide, lidocaine, metoprolol, digoxin and atropine upon the conduction of ventricular premature beats, were studied in 48 healthy volunteers. The conduction time of the first premature beat, induced 1 ms after the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) was longer than that of the basic paced beats in 41 of the 48 subjects (85%); in 31 (65%) the delay was greater than 5 ms, indicating subnormal conduction. Digoxin decreased the delay so that it became insignificant, while, after procainamide, the delay increased significantly. The other agents did not significantly affect the subnormal conduction. The mean conduction times of premature beats, induced 30-50 ms after the VERP, were shorter than the basic conduction time in 43 of the 48 subjects (90%), and in 25 (52%) the decrease was greater than 5 ms, showing supernormal conduction. Lidocaine abolished the supernormal conduction. The other agents did not significantly alter the supernormal conduction. In the healthy heart, sub- and supernormal conduction of premature beats seem to be common phenomena, and seem, with few exceptions, to be largely unaffected by clinical doses of procainamide, lidocaine, metoprolol, digoxin and atropine.", 
    "22": "Ischaemic heart disease is the main cause of death. Most of these deaths are sudden and occur within the first few hours of onset of symptoms and before the patient reaches the hospital. It is generally accepted, that sudden death is due to ventricular fibrillation. The aim of this presentation is to review the studies of long-term antiarrhythmic therapy and beta-blockade in the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Studies, in which a given antiarrhythmic drug was routinely applied, have universally failed to show any protective effect. However, when effective patient specific drugs are selected during programmed ventricular stimulation, long-term treatment in high risk patients may be beneficial. Recently suggestive evidence has been presented, that long-term beta-blockade is beneficial in preventing sudden death and reducing overall mortality in ischaemic heart diseases although the antiarrhythmic properties of beta-blockers are relatively weak.", 
    "23": "The main goal of all diagnostic procedures after myocardial infarction is the identification of high risk patients. Left ventricular pump function, the extent of coronary artery disease and serious arrhythmias have the strongest impact upon prognosis. Left ventricular pump function can be assessed by echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography. This is of importance in patients with congestive heart failure to distinguish between a resectable aneurysm and diffusely impaired pump function. Routine application of these methods does not seem necessary since our ability to improve pump function is limited. The extent of coronary artery disease can not be assessed non-invasively. Ergometry does provide us, however, with clinically important data (angina?, ST-depression?, arrhythmia?, drop of blood pressure? etc.) some of which are also predictors of prognosis. Stress testing with low work loads (up to 75 W) should therefore be performed in all patients soon after the infarct on a routine basis. The standard 12-lead ECG is insufficient for the diagnosis of serious arrhythmias. Therefore a 24-hour ECG tape recording would be desirable in every patient, but it is particularly important in patients with poor left ventricular function or premature beats on the resting ECG, who are known to have a high probability of serious arrhythmias. Coronary arteriography is indicated, when the patient is severely symptomatic and when the non-invasive tests indicate that the patient is at high risk. Drug therapy of angina pectoris and arrhythmias after myocardial infarction is basically the same as in patients without a history of infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Treatment of angina pectoris should follow the clinical course: Stable angina is most often responding to nitropreparations, betablockers or calciumantagonists; differentialtherapy should consider the basic state of the patient: age, heart-rate, hypo- or hypertension, cardiac failure or asthma bronchiale etc. Unstable angina needs more attention and should be transferred to a coronary care unit. Analgetics, sedatives, oxygen and nitrates should be applied under hemodynamic monitoring. Only in rare cases with cardiac failure or with rapid atrial fibrillation glycosides will be necessary. In extreme bradiacardias a pacemaker can be helpful. Captopril might be a new substance in nonresponders.", 
    "25": "The pupillary responses to different agonists and antagonists of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems have been studied in normal volunteers. The eyedrops were instilled unilaterally and the responses were evaluated by measuring the changes in diameter of the pupils (in millimeters). All the eyedrops induced an unilateral response on the instilled side. The mydriatic substances (phenylephrine, thropamide, tyramine) showed an evident and lasting action. Phenylephrine 1% was found to be a threshold dose to acquire the mydriatic effect. The beta blocking agent (timolol) induced a short mydriatic response, while methaproterenol did not change the pupillary diameter. Clonidine caused an unilateral mydriasis. The alpha blocking agent and the parasympathetic system stimulation agent induced miotic effects The results are discussed with particular reference to the possible mechanism of the pupillary response to timolol and clonidine.", 
    "26": "The polarity of a drug is one of the most important parameters for the elaboration of switching systems. If the polarity of the drug is low or medium, \"reversed-phase\" chromatography is well adapted. The plasma or urine sample is diluted with water, centrifuged and injected first into a column of medium polarity (C2, CN or diol bonded phases). The compounds of interest are stopped on the top of the column and rinsed with water, then eluted and chromatographed on a C8 or C18 analytical column. A third column of still lower polarity can be added to improve the specificity of the system. In each successive step, the polarities of the mobile phases and columns should be decreased to reconcentrate the sample and reduce the band broadening that occurred in the previous step. Compounds of high polarity show almost no retention on reversed-phase columns, and normal-phase chromatography should be used. Aqueous solutions cannot be injected into polar bonded-phase columns as they lead to excessive band broadening. This problem can be solved by diluting plasma or urine with a large volume of a water-miscible organic solvent and injecting the clear supernatant. The compounds to be assayed are first reconcentrated on a polar column (NH2 or N(CH3)2 bonded phase) and then eluted. The selected \"heart cut\" of the eluate is chromatographed on another, more polar column. The influence of the polarity of drugs on the choice of switching systems is exemplified by assay methods for drugs of low, medium and high polarity.", 
    "27": "To assay various secondary amino drugs (sympatomimetic, beta-blocking, antiarrhythmic agents), they were converted to metal (copper or nickel) dithiocarbamate complexes by means of a pre-column derivatization method. The electrochemical properties of the complexes were studied. They were chromatographed on a reversed-phase column (LiChrosorb RP-18) with mixtures of acetate buffer (pH 5.8) and organic solvents (methanol, acetonitrile, ethanol or dichloromethane) as mobile phases. The complexes were detected by amperometry (applied potential of +0.7 V vs. SCE) or by UV spectrophotometry. The procedure has great sensitivity (10(-12) mole for each injected compound) and good selectivity for the more substituted amino drugs.", 
    "28": "Epinephrine treatment of the perfused rat heart led to an increase in glucose uptake, detritiation of [5-3H] glucose, glycogenolysis, and the formation of lactate. The change in the rate of formation of 3H2O from [5-3H]glucose was slower to develop (commencing at approximately 30 s) than changes in cyclic AMP concentration, hexose-6-P concentration, and the phosphorylase a/(a + b) ratio which were maximal at 24 s. Epinephrine plus propranolol (alpha-adrenergic combination) treatment of the perfused heart also led to increases in glucose uptake, detritiation of [5-3H]glucose, and the formation of lactate, but these occurred without significant changes in cyclic AMP concentration, hexose-6-P concentration, or the phosphorylase a/(a + b) ratio. Half-maximal stimulation of glucose uptake occurred at 0.2 microM epinephrine, 1.5 microM methoxamine, and 1 microM isoproterenol. The increase in glucose uptake mediated by 1 microM epinephrine was blocked by 10 microM prazosin but unaffected by 10 microM propranolol. The increase in glucose uptake mediated by 10 microM epinephrine plus 10 microM propranolol was partly blocked by yohimbine and completely blocked by prazosin. A role for Ca2+ in the adrenergic regulation of glucose uptake was indicated by the sensitivity of the epinephrine dose curve to Ca2+ and the dependence of epinephrine on Ca2+. In addition the increases in glucose uptake mediated by 1 microM epinephrine, 1 microM epinephrine plus 10 microM propranolol, 1 microM isoproterenol, and by 10 mM CaCl2 were each blocked by the Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (1 microM). It is concluded that Ca2+-dependent alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor mechanisms are present in rat heart for controlling glucose uptake. At submicromolar levels of epinephrine the predominant receptors utilized appear to be alpha 1.", 
    "29": "Cyclic AMP accumulation in embryonic chick heart cells and binding of the beta-adrenergic antagonist 125I-pindolol to intact cells has been examined during the first 30 min of (-)-isoproterenol-induced desensitization. Myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors exist in two states which bind agonists with high (KD congruent to 10 nM) and low (KD congruent to 10 microM) affinities. Both activation and desensitization of cyclic AMP accumulation were mediated by (-)-isoproterenol binding to high affinity receptors. (-)-Isoproterenol-induced desensitization of cyclic AMP accumulation occurred with a t1/2 of 3.8 min. Desensitization was accompanied by a decrease in the number of 125I-pindolol binding sites assessed by equilibrium radioligand binding assays conducted at 4 degrees C or short (80 s) binding assays conducted at 37 degrees C. There was an excellent temporal correlation between loss of binding and loss of (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. After (-)-isoproterenol-induced desensitization, most of the remaining receptors assayed at 4 degrees C bound (-)-isoproterenol with high affinity. A rapid (-)-isoproterenol-induced decrease in the number of 125I-pindolol binding sites also occurred in adult canine heart cells and rat adipocytes. The data suggest that agonists do not cause uncoupling of surface receptors. Receptors may be uncoupled as a consequence of rapid sequestration into a hydrophobic compartment.", 
    "30": "The effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the carotid body chemoreceptor response to hypoxia was assessed in anesthetized and paralyzed cats. Propranolol, atenolol and ICI 118,551 each abolished the enhancement of chemoreceptor activity produced by i.v. infusion of exogenous isoproterenol; however, the blocking drugs did not significantly diminish the increase in chemoreceptor neural discharge induced by hypoxia. These results do not support the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic receptors play an essential role in the chemoreceptor response to oxygen deprivation.", 
    "31": "Administration of 6-hydroxydopamine to neonatal rats results in a permanent increase in the norepinephrine content in several brainstem areas. To assess the physiological effects of this hyperinnervation, we studied the noradrenergic inhibition of transmission of sensory information through the principal sensory and rostral spinal trigeminal nuclei. Unit activity produced by tactile stimulation of the face was recorded extracellularly from trigeminal sensory neurons in normal and hyperinnervated rats. The noradrenergic neurons projecting to the trigeminal sensory nuclei (locus coeruleus and the region of the lateral lemniscus) were stimulated 40 ms prior to delivery of a tactile stimulus to the face, producing complete inhibition. The interstimulus interval was then increased in 100 ms increments until the sensory response returned to control values. Compared with controls, the duration of inhibition was 30% longer in hyperinnervated rats and 25% shorter in rats depleted of catecholamines with reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. While the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, had no effect on the duration of inhibition in normal animals, the mean latency of response to tactile stimulation was decreased from 15.3 to 10.4 ms. Propranolol given to hyperinnervated rats decreased the latency of the response to tactile stimulation from 15.1 to 9.1 ms and decreased the duration of inhibition by 40% compared with untreated hyperinnervated rats, suggesting an alteration in numbers or sensitivity of beta-receptors. Since the drug treatment never eliminated the inhibition due to locus coeruleus stimulation, there is also a non-noradrenergic component. We conclude from these observations that noradrenergic hyperinnervation is not completely counteracted by receptor down regulation.", 
    "32": "One hundred forty-four patients admitted to the hospital within 4 hours after the onset of symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly assigned to either intravenous timolol treatment or to matching placebo. Infarct evolution was assessed by continuous vectorcardiography and CK release. Timolol reduced myocardial ischemia and infarct size as measured by an accelerated reduction in ST-vector magnitude, a significant reduction in maximal cumulative CK release (29.5%) and significantly smaller changes in QRS-vector parameters (20 to 25%). Furthermore, the predicted CK release and maximal QRS-vector change for a given initial ST-vector magnitude was significantly reduced by timolol. The drug regimen also caused a significant reduction in pain and the need for analgesic medication.", 
    "33": "Safe, effective prophylaxis of arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an important clinical goal. Despite rescue squads, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) has a poor prognosis. Even in-hospital VF has an important morbidity and mortality. Successful prophylactic therapy may also prevent infarct size enlargement associated with tachyarrhythmias. Several antiarrhythmic drugs have been investigated. In 3 studies, mortality was significantly reduced, but all of these have serious methodologic flaws and the validity of their conclusions is debatable. More reliance can be placed on 2 other studies which suggested that VF was significantly reduced by prophylactic therapy. However, in one of these studies, which used high-dose intravenous lidocaine, an unusually high incidence of VF was observed in the placebo-treated patients. The second study, reporting the use of metoprolol in AMI, was based on retrospective subset analysis. The reduction in VF was seen from the fourth day onwards and not during the acute phase of infarction. The favorable results with high-dose intravenous lidocaine are the basis for widespread use of prophylactic arrhythmia therapy in AMI. Uncontrolled observations provide some corroboration of the benefit. However, the claimed efficacy for lidocaine remains scientifically poorly substantiated and the safety of the high-dose regimen is controversial. Effective prophylaxis of arrhythmias in AMI could have important clinical benefit. However, the strategy would entail administration of a drug to many patients not at risk of arrhythmias (those without AMI) and to a number of patients in whom the complications of infarction are destined to develop.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "Understanding of the phenomenon of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and definition of proper treatment have changed radically in the past decade. AMI is regarded as an evolving event with an outcome that may be modifiable. Initial attempts at intervention involved reducing myocardial oxygen requirements and salvaging ischemic tissue. Studies of beta-blockade administration, which at first was considered contraindicated, have shown that such treatment may be beneficial and may also be safe in the postinfarction period. The hypothesis that the mass of infarct sustained is important to outcome is also under study, with use of such techniques as serial plasma creatine kinase (CK) determinations and ejection fraction for assessing infarct size. Analysis of isoforms of CK is a new area of interest that may facilitate early diagnosis and define the chronologic aspects of infarcts. Myocardial reperfusion with fibrolytic agents has yielded apparent benefit, but it is an aggressive and still experimental form of intervention. Positron tomography has been used for quantitative assessment of regional metabolism and perfusion. Initial results of reperfusion with clot-selective fibrinolytic agents, expected to reduce the risk of bleeding, indicate favorable effects on the heart and no evidence of systemic bleeding.", 
    "35": "After coronary arterial occlusion, catecholamines are released from storage depots in the left ventricle and injured myocardial cells are exposed to relatively high concentrations of catecholamines during the evolutionary period in which cell injury is becoming progressively more severe. In addition, in experimental animal models, there is a substantial increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density without any alteration in affinity within 1 hour of permanent coronary arterial occlusion. Recent data suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptor density increases within 30 to 60 minutes after coronary arterial occlusion in experimental animal models. The administration of catecholamines during the early phases of evolving myocardial injury can result in heightened adrenergic biochemical responses in severely injured compared with normally perfused tissue in the hearts of experimental animals. Thus, there is adequate rationale for anticipating that beta-adrenergic antagonists would protect ischemic myocardium and potentially reduce the incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in individuals with evolving acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Studies in animal models demonstrate that the administration of beta-adrenergic antagonists in the first few minutes after coronary artery occlusion may reduce the ultimate extent of myocardial necrosis. Clinical data from several different trials in which beta-adrenergic antagonists were administered to (1) protect ischemic myocardium and preserve ventricular function and (2) reduce the severity of serious ventricular arrhythmias in patients with AMI are reviewed. The effects of longer-term administration of beta-adrenergic antagonists in patients after AMI in prolonging life and reducing risk of reinfarction are presented.", 
    "36": "Several controlled studies with long-term administration of beta blockers in postinfarction patients have demonstrated a reduction in cardiac events and mortality. During acute myocardial infarction (AMI), conventional treatment is directed mainly at such complications as pump failure and arrhythmias. Another approach attempts to influence the natural evolution of impending myocardial necrosis by interrupting the process in its reversible phase. In a double-blind trial with metoprolol in suspected or definite AMI, 1,395 patients were studied, 698 of whom received metoprolol and 697 placebo. The 3-month mortality was 36% lower in the metoprolol group (p = 0.024). A reduction in severe ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation and tachycardia) was also seen. Chest pain was reduced and there was less need of analgesic drugs in the metoprolol group. Intervention within 12 hours resulted in a limitation of infarct size, a decreased need for furosemide and a shortened hospital stay. A significant reduction in mortality was maintained after 2 years of follow-up despite the same treatment in both groups between 3 and 24 months. Early institution of metoprolol in AMI has resulted in reduced mortality and morbidity.", 
    "37": "Photoaffinity labeling techniques have recently demonstrated that mammalian beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors reside on peptides of Mr 62 000-64 000. These receptor peptides are susceptible to endogenous metalloproteinases which produce peptides of Mr 30 000-55 000. Several proteinase inhibitors markedly attenuate this process, specifically EDTA and EGTA. In this study we investigated the functional significance of this proteolysis (and its inhibition) in the beta 2-adrenergic receptor-adenylate cyclase system derived from rat lung membranes. Membrane preparations containing proteolytically derived fragments of the receptor of Mr 40 000-55 000 are fully functional with respect to their ability to bind beta-adrenergic antagonist radioligands such as [3H]dihydroalprenolol and beta-adrenergic antagonist photoaffinity reagents such as p-azido-m-[125I]iodobenzylcarazolol. They retain the ability to form a high-affinity, agonist-promoted, guanine nucleotide-sensitive complex thought to represent a ternary complex of agonist, receptor and guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. Nonetheless, after proteolysis, GTP is less able to revert this high-affinity receptor complex to one of lower affinity, and all aspects of adenylate cyclase stimulation are reduced. In addition, the functional integrity of the N protein in membranes prepared without proteinase inhibitors is reduced as assessed by reconstitution studies with the cyc- variant of S49 lymphoma cell membranes. These results suggest that endogenous proteolysis does not directly impair the ability of beta-adrenergic receptors to either bind ligands or interact with the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. However, they imply that endogenous proteolysis likely impairs the functionality of other components of the adenylate cyclase system, such as the nucleotide regulatory protein.", 
    "38": "The effects of two adrenoceptor antagonists, nicergoline (alpha 1) and acebutolol (beta 1), on the contraction of myometrium in the proestrous rat were compared to those of noradrenaline and phentolamine. The spontaneous myometrial contractions of Wistar rats on the day of proestrus were recorded isometrically and the data were analysed using Wilcoxon non-parametric statistics. All drugs were administered i.v. and the doses are expressed as microgram/kg body weight. Noradrenaline (1200 micrograms/kg per h) induced a 32.5% reduction (P less than 0.001) of the uterine contraction amplitude. Nicergoline did not alter uterine motility significantly when administered alone at doses ranging from 400 to 1600 micrograms/kg. However, successive injections of nicergoline in the same range given during noradrenaline infusion at 600 micrograms/kg per h potentiated the relaxing action of the latter (38%, P less than 0.01). Phentolamine (120 micrograms/kg) reduced myometrial activity by 25% (P less than 0.05). This inhibitory response rose to 65% (P less than 0.001) when the dose of phentolamine was increased to 960 micrograms/kg. When a single injection of nicergoline (400 micrograms/kg) was followed by the administration of increasing doses of acebutolol (120, 1200, 2400 micrograms/kg) the slight inhibitory effect on uterine motility observed after administration of each of the two agents separately became more pronounced (P less than 0.05). It appears from these results that combining noradrenaline with nicergoline and nicergoline with acebutolol leads to potentiation of their relaxing effects. Furthermore the results confirm that nicergoline is a partial alpha-blocker.", 
    "39": "Determinations of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were performed before treatment, then every 3 months for one year, in 45 hypertensive patients treated with acebutolol alone in daily doses equal or superior to 800 mg. Non significant ANA titers (1/10 to 1/40) were detected before treatment in 8.8% of the patients. After one year of treatment, 15.5% of the patients were found to have antinuclear antibodies. In 4 (8.8%) female patients (3 of whom were ANA-negative before treatment) the ANA titers were above 1/40. Treatment was discontinued in one of these due to the occurrence of bronchospasm. No lupus-like syndrome was observed during the course of the study. Prolonged prospective studies with acebutolol alone would be required to determine whether in the long term the incidence of significant ANA titers remains at the 8.8% level or increases.", 
    "40": "Acebutolol may induce the development of antinuclear antibodies and, exceptionally, of a lupus-like syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of antinuclear antibodies in hypertensive diabetics under long-term treatment with acebutolol. Seventy-eight normal subjects, 75 diabetics under antidiabetic therapy only, and 75 hypertensive diabetics who received acebutolol in mean doses of 478 +/- 242 mg/day for at least one year were investigated. The 3 groups were comparable with regard to age and sex. Antinuclear antibodies were detected in 18.6% of diabetics under acebutolol, as against 3.8% and 1.3% respectively of subjects in the other groups (p less than 0.01). There was no correlation between the levels of antinuclear antibodies and the dosage or duration of acebutolol treatment. None of the sera tested contained antinative DNA antibodies, and none of the hypertensive diabetics exhibited signs of lupus-like syndrome.", 
    "41": "The experiments concerned the effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the leukotriene-C4 (LTC4)-induced secretory release response from carrageenan-elicited rat peritoneal macrophages. Both the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol reversed the LTC4-induced release response. Addition of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol or the beta 2-selective antagonist H3525 abolished these effects. Practolol, a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist was without any effect on the isoprenaline-LTC4 interaction. These results are consistent with the presence of beta 2-adrenoceptors on macrophages. The results of this study are discussed in view of a possible, cyclic adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated interaction between prostaglandin E2 and LTC4 in modulating macrophage function.", 
    "42": "The turkey erythrocyte contains a beta 1-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase system. We have examined the effects of pretreatment with receptor antagonists on adenylate cyclase activity and the individual components in the pathway of enzyme activation in this system. Isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is increased by 30% (P less than 0.01) over control in membranes derived from cells preincubated with the antagonist propranolol. The effect is stereospecific and dose-related with a EC50 of 100 nM for the (-) isomer. The time course of effect is rapid being complete by 90 min. Non-receptor mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by manganese ion, forskolin and NaF is similarly enhanced following propranolol pretreatment. Sensitization of adenylate cyclase activity also occurs following pretreatment with a number of antagonists but is not seen after preincubation with pindolol or practolol. Quantitation of beta-adrenergic receptor (R) density using [125I]cyanopindolol indicates no difference between membranes derived from control and antagonist pretreated cells. Coupling of R with the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (N) as assessed by high affinity agonist binding is unchanged following pretreatment. The efficacy of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate Gpp(NH)p in producing a shift of agonist binding curves associated with destabilization of high affinity H-R-N complexes, is also the same (EC50 = 0.2 microM) in membranes from control and antagonist treated cells. The isoproterenol stimulated rate of release of [3H]GDP from membranes preloaded with [3H]GTP as an index of formation of an active form of the N protein is similarly unaffected by antagonist preincubation. We conclude that the mechanism of the observed sensitization of turkey erythrocyte adenylate cyclase by beta-adrenergic antagonists is receptor mediated and likely involves facilitation of N interaction with the catalytic subunit of the enzyme.", 
    "43": "The characteristics of beta adrenergic receptors of human erythrocyte membranes were investigated using (-)125iodocyanopindolol as a radioligand. Inhibition of (-)125iodocyanopindolol specific binding was checked using either atenolol and metoprolol as beta 1 selective antagonists or ICI 118551 and IPS 339 as beta 2 selective antagonists. The results showed non linear Hofstee's plots suggesting that both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenergic receptors are present. Analysis of the data yielded a beta 1/beta 2 adrenergic receptor ratio of approximately 33/67. Thus it is concluded that beta 2 subtype is predominant on human erythrocyte membranes.", 
    "44": "A beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol, was given by mouth, 5 and 10 mg doses per 24 hours, in a double-blind randomized cross-over trial to 12 patients with stable coronary-heart disease. Ischaemia criteria proved not reproducible in control ergometry tests on two patients, leaving ten patients for further evaluation. On two days, one week apart, bicycle ergometry was undertaken until the occurrence of ST segment depression of at least 0.3 mV, often associated with angina. Four, eight and 24 hours after the drug had been taken, the ergometry was repeated to the same maximal Watt level and duration of exercise. Heart rate and pressure-rate product at rest, as well as the same parameters including ST segment depressions immediately at the end of exercise, significantly fell after bisoprolol during the entire trial period independently of the dose. There was no sign of reduced effectiveness 24 hours after drug intake. The results indicate that treatment of stable angina with bisoprolol can be achieved with a single daily dose.", 
    "45": "A sensitive, selective and reproducible reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the quantification of sotalol in human serum and urine. Sotalol and the internal standard, atenolol, were extracted from alkalinized serum and urine (pH 9.0) into 1-butanol--chloroform (20:60, v/v). The organic phase was evaporated, and to the residue was added 0.1 M sulphuric acid (serum analysis) or mobile phase (urine analysis). The mobile phase consisted of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 3.2) and acetonitrile (20:80, v/v) containing 3 mM n-octylsodium sulphate. The flow-rate was 1.5 ml/min. The retention times of atenolol and sotalol were 7 and 10 min, respectively. Ultraviolet detection at 226 nm made it possible to achieve a detection limit of 0.03 mumol/l.", 
    "46": "The increase in mitochondrial uncoupling protein in brown adipose tissue during acute stimulation by exposure of animals to cold was examined. Uncoupling protein level increased during the first hours of tissue stimulation. Use of a cDNA probe shows that synthesis of uncoupling protein mRNA was quickly stimulated. Animals treated with propranolol exhibited neither increase in uncoupling protein mRNA nor increase in the protein itself.", 
    "47": "Parotid gland membranes labelled with [3H]inositol were challenged with the cholinergic agonist, carbamylcholine, or with epinephrine in the presence of propranolol. Both agonists caused a significant breakdown of labelled phosphoinositides (17.5%) in membranes suspended in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer. This effect was abolished by the respective antagonists, atropine or phentolamine. The carbamylcholine-induced breakdown of labelled phosphoinositides did not require cytosol. The addition of cytosol alone, or the exposure of membranes to a medium of low ionic strength caused a significant breakdown of phosphoinositides (10-40%). No further breakdown due to the addition of carbamylcholine was observed under these conditions. It is suggested that neurotransmitter-induced breakdown of phosphoinositides is effected by membrane-associated enzyme(s) and can be observed only in a medium of high ionic strength.", 
    "48": "The steady-state response properties of two current models for receptor/nucleotide coupling protein/adenylate cyclase systems are examined by computer modeling techniques. In the model of Levitzki (Trends Pharmac. Sci., May, 1982, pp. 203-208), a ligand may give rise to full or partial agonist behavior only. In the model of Stadel, DeLean, and Lefkowitz (1982) configurations of the rate constants can be found which lead not only to full or partial agonist behavior, but also to varying degrees of inhibition at sufficiently high concentrations of ligand, as observed experimentally in a variety of adenylate cyclase systems. In the latter model, it is also possible to find configurations of the rate constants for which addition of a ligand will lead to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The nature of partial agonism and reasons as to why it may be expected to occur for a wide variety of ligands are discussed.", 
    "49": "A modification of beta-adrenoceptor binding has been observed in different human and animal tissues after glucocorticoid administration. In this study we observed that hydrocortisone increased human intact lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors labelled with 3H-dyhydroalprenolol in vitro, in physiological and pharmacological concentrations. In saturation experiments hydrocortisone (10(-6)M) significantly raised beta-adrenoceptor Bmax and KD. Intact living lymphocytes seem to be a useful model for further investigation in man of the regulation of beta-adrenoceptors by glucocorticoids in physiological conditions.", 
    "50": "Endralazine is a peripherally-acting vasodilator similar to hydralazine. In normotensive subjects and essential hypertensive and renal patients, single oral doses of 10 mg endralazine led to substantial falls in blood pressure, with no significant additional orthostatic effect. Maintenance endralazine treatment (5 or 10 mg b.d.) of essential hypertensive patients significantly improved blood pressure control: the mean supine blood pressure improved from 197/107 mmHg on baseline treatment with a thiazide and beta-blocker to 160/86 mmHg after one week and 161/91 mmHg after one year. There was no evidence of fluid retention and in all patients treated for at least one year the anti-nuclear factor remained negative. Following acute administration the terminal elimination half-life of endralazine was approximately 2.5 h and the oral bioavailability was 75%. During chronic treatment the elimination half-life significantly increased to about 7.5 h. The elimination half-life following the first dose was only significantly prolonged in the renal dialysis group. There were no significant differences related to acetylator phenotype.", 
    "51": "The baroreflex control of myocardial contractility has been assessed in the conscious normotensive and hypertensive rabbit. Stimulus response curves relating graded changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) to induced changes in peak rate of change of left ventricular pressure (peak LV dP/dt) were compared during constant heart rate controlled by atrial pacing and when heart rate was uncontrolled. The experiments were repeated after beta-block, cholinergic block and during combined block in both A rise in MAP produced a fall in peak LV dP/dt which was due to two components. There was a reflex negative inotropic effect which was independent of heart rate and a reduction in peak LV dP/dt due to reflex bradycardia. The sympathetic nerves were primarily responsible for the direct negative inotropic effect and the vagus for the indirect effect, secondary to the bradycardia. The slope of the stimulus response curves relating the baroreflex fall in peak LV dP/dt to rises in MAP were similar in normotensive and hypertensive animals, in contrast to the sensitivity of the baroreflex heart rate response which is impaired in animals with chronic hypertension.", 
    "52": "The traditional biochemical tests of sympathetic nervous system function used in clinical diagnosis (urine and plasma catecholamine measurements) are indices of \"overall\" sympathetic nervous activity, and incapable of detecting localised changes in sympathetic tone confined to individual organs. Recently developed radiotracer methods, which enable the pattern of sympathetic nervous dysfunction in disease states to be delineated, were used to detect abnormalities in regional sympathetic nervous system activity in two patients presenting problems in management. In one, the abnormality of sympathetic function was iatrogenic, a post-sympathectomy denervation of the lower regions of the body, associated with incapacitating postural hypotension. In the other, unexplained persistent sinus tachycardia proved to be due to an increase in sympathetic nervous tone restricted to the innervation of the heart. Knowledge of the underlying sympathetic nervous pathophysiology in these patients influenced the choice of drugs subsequently used in their treatment.", 
    "53": "This study determines the inotropic effects of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in the isolated, arterial perfused newborn (NB) and adult (A) rabbit heart. Significant positive inotropism of PGD2 was observed at all concentrations studied (1 X 10(-17) to 1 X 10(-7) M) in the two age groups; the effect in the NB was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than that in the A at PGD2 concentrations higher than 1 X 10(-17) M. Significant positive inotropism of PGE1 was observed at PGE1 concentrations higher than 1 X 10(-8) M in the NB, and only at 1 X 10(-6) M in the A. In the NB, the relaxation parameters [1/2 RT and the ratio of +dT/dt (max) to -dT/dt (max)] decreased to 80% of control after PGE1 infusion, but not after PGD2 infusion. In contrast, relaxation parameters in the A were not different from control. Propranolol (1 X 10(-6) M) did not alter the positive inotropic action of PGD2 and PGE1 in the NB. These data indicate that: 1) the positive inotropic effects of PGD2 and PGE1 in NB are greater than that in the A, 2) PGE1 and not PGD2, enhances myocardial relaxation only in the NB, 3) the contractile effects of PGD2 and PGE1 are not mediated by beta-receptors.", 
    "54": "Epinephrine and carbachol, but not norepinephrine, significantly stimulated oxygen consumption in rat sublingual gland slices. The response to epinephrine was blocked by phentolamine and yohimbine, while propranolol and prazosin did not affect it. The response to carbachol was blocked by atropine. Also, oxygen consumption induced by both epinephrine and carbachol was inhibited by verapamil. These findings suggest that epinephrine enhanced oxygen consumption in sublingual gland slices by activation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, while carbachol activated muscarinic receptors; activation of both receptors mediated the respiratory response by facilitating the entry of extracellular Ca.", 
    "55": "It is usually postulated that the side chain attached to 17 beta position on the steroid nucleus of the cardioactive glycosides is a major determinant of their pharmacological activity. A new aminosteroid (LND 623) has been prepared. Despite the fact that the structural features quoted above are lacking, the product demonstrates a strong inotropic effect. LND 623 was active at the same range of concentrations as ouabain or digoxin. However, the maximum increase of the contractile force was significantly higher. The strength of the inotropic action is not modified in the presence of propranolol. The preliminary results suggest that the molecular requirements for the interaction of the drugs with the 'inotropic receptor' may be re-examined.",

    "57": "A distinct decrease of oxytocin was found in the hypothalamus of immobilized rats but not of those exposed to cold. Similarly, the content of oxytocin was lower in the neurohypophysis of rats immobilized for 24 hr but, on the contrary, increased in animals exposed to cold for 24 hr. Propranolol did not modify the mentioned changes brought about by immobilization or exposure to cold.", 
    "58": "Infusions with stepwise increasing concentrations of epinephrine (from 2.5 to 10 micrograms/min) and norepinephrine (0.5-2.0 micrograms/min) were given to normal subjects. During infusion of epinephrine there was a clear rise of the serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels already at the lowest concentration. Concomitantly there was a fall in the serum concentrations of calcium. The PTH levels returned to baseline promptly after termination of infusion whereas hypocalcaemia persisted up to 30 minutes, indicating a primary response of PTH to epinephrine. When propranolol was given prior to and during the epinephrine infusion no significant changes occurred for either PTH or calcium. During infusion of norepinephrine no consistent significant changes were noted for either PTH or serum calcium. Thus, our data do not support any concept of a basal adrenergic tone which normally modulates the secretion of PTH. However, during conditions of stress the beta-adrenergic stimulation night be of importance.", 
    "59": "The additive effects of propranolol and exercise on peripheral blood flow distribution were studied in conscious dogs. During treadmill exercise (8-10 km/h and 0% grade for 15 min.) cardiac performance increased significantly in parallel with myocardial and muscular blood flow (greater than 100%). Blood perfusion to liver and spleen decreased significantly (30% and 34%) while blood flow to other organs was unaltered. Under resting conditions propranolol only modified blood flow to liver and spleen (-50% and -38%). During exercise after propranolol a limited augmentation in cardiac performance and in myocardial and muscular blood flow was observed; splanchnic blood flow which was most affected by propranolol at rest did not further decrease during exercise after propranolol. The present observations demonstrate that propranolol, despite minor haemodynamic modifications, induces significant alterations in blood flow to splanchnic organs. The influence of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade was even more evident under conditions of augmented sympathetic activity as reflected by a significant limitation of increase in cardiac performance, myocardial and muscular blood flow and by a sustained redistribution of splanchnic blood flow during exercise after propranolol.", 
    "60": "Serum protein and lipid concentrations as well as the serum protein binding of propranolol, diazepam and phenytoin were measured in normal weight and obese volunteers. Concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) in the obese subjects were double that of the lean controls. Conversely, concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) were decreased in the obese group. The serum binding of propranolol was increased in the obese subjects and correlated with serum AAG concentrations. Diazepam binding was slightly decreased in the obese as a result of lower serum albumin concentrations and elevated free fatty acids. The binding of phenytoin was comparable in all of the volunteers. These findings point out some of the complex pathophysiologic changes associated with obesity which may in turn influence drug disposition and hence drug therapy in the obese patient.", 
    "61": "In patients with mild hypertension, flurbiprofen in a dose of 100 mg daily for 7 days attenuated the hypotensive effect of a single dose of propranolol 80 mg but not of atenolol 100 mg. The attenuation was not due to an effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of either propranolol or atenolol. An alternative explanation is required.", 
    "62": "A single dose of 80 mg racemic propranolol hydrochloride was administered by mouth to six healthy male volunteers. The mean concentration achieved in seminal plasma at 2 h after dosing was almost identical to that in blood serum. The concentrations of propranolol in seminal plasma and saliva were much less than those known to reduce sperm motility by 50% in vitro. The concentrations in saliva did not reflect those in blood serum. Propranolol in the dose administered in this study is unlikely to affect fertility by its presence in saliva or semen.", 
    "63": "Short term effect of digoxin on left ventricular performance was studied in six healthy volunteers before and during atenolol or nifedipine administration. Left ventricular function was evaluated by systolic time intervals and echocardiography. No changes in left ventricular end diastolic or systolic dimensions occurred throughout the study, indicating unchanged ventricular pre- and afterload. Thus, changes in the systolic time intervals must be attributed to changes in cardiac contractility. Changes in the pre-ejection period index (PEPI) obtained from the systolic time intervals were used as a measure of digoxin-induced inotropism. A concentration-response relationship between plasma digoxin level and changes in PEPI was revealed when digoxin was given alone. Atenolol did not influence the digoxin-induced inotropism at a given serum digoxin level. During nifedipine administration no inotropic effect of digoxin could be demonstrated. Thus, it is concluded that nifedipine attenuates digoxin-induced inotropism, while atenolol seems without this effect. These results are in accordance with previous experiments and reflect the different pharmacological sites of action of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium channel blocking agents. Plasma digoxin concentration, renal digoxin clearance and creatinine clearance did not change during atenolol or nifedipine.", 
    "64": "Propranolol and its active 4-hydroxy metabolite are determined by direct injection of spiked plasma samples onto a protein-coated ODS liquid chromatographic column. The recovery of propranolol and the 4-hydroxy metabolite is essentially quantitative and the reproducibility is good. The reproducibility and simplicity may be superior to the conventional HPLC analyses which include pretreatment, i.e., solvent extraction or deproteinization.", 
    "65": "The effects of a fixed combination of chlorthalidone (25 mg) and metoprolol slow-release (200 mg) (CM) on 24 hour blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) values and their variabilities were evaluated in 6 ambulant hypertensives by the Oxford method, to obtain continuous intra-arterial recording and by computer to have a beat-to-beat analysis of the data. Compared to pre-treatment values, average 24 hour HR and mean BP recorded after 7-10 days of once daily CM orally administration were reduced by 18.4 +/- 3.1 and 14.7 +/- 3.0%, respectively. The effects of CM were also evident during isometric and dynamic exercise, whose pressor and tachycardic responses were left unimpaired (BP) or were only slightly reduced (HR) by CM. The long- and short-term BP and HR variabilities (calculated as variation coefficients among and within half hours, and within minutes) were also left unaffected by CM. These findings indicate that once a day administration of CM effectively reduces BP and HR over the 24 hours, without interfering with cardiovascular homeostasis. The effective and persistent reduction in both these variables (as well as their occurrence during exercise) suggests that the antihypertensive action of this treatment is accompanied by a clear-cut reduction in cardiac work.", 
    "66": "The aim of the study was to establish whether and how circadian rhythms alter the bioavailability of, and response of circulatory and ventilatory functions to 80 mg of propranolol given at four different test times. Both Cmax and AUC were lowest at 2:00 pm as compared with other test times in healthy group (N = 6), lower in cirrhosis (N = 6), but none in portacaval shunt (N = 3). Thus, at 2:00 pm, liver extraction seems to be the best in healthy subjects, worse in cirrhotics and negligible in PC shunt. The mean AUC value in PC shunt patients was three times as high as in healthy subjects and cirrhotics. This seems to be due to the reduced first-pass extraction phenomenon in the liver in PC cases. All subjects exhibited a prompt and significant depression of radial pulse and systolic BP; this effect on radial pulse was lasting longer at 2:00 am than at other test times. The initial values of PEF were lowest at 2:00 am and no depressing effect of propranolol was observed in comparison with other test times. From the practical point of view, the changeable bioavailability of propranolol given at different times of the day has no direct consequences in regards to the temporal response to the drug in healthy subjects and cirrhotics, since it is likely that both propranolol and its metabolites (4-OHP) are active as beta-blockers. Twenty-four hour oscillations of the responses to propranolol seem to exist both in healthy and cirrhotic patients.", 
    "67": "The effect of the beta-blocker propranolol (PR) in sublethal poisoning with 2, 4,-dinitrophenol (DNP) was studied on carbohydrate kinetics in dogs. Parameters of glucose and lactate turnovers were measured by using a mixture of 3-3H-glucose and 14C-lactate according to the primed constant rate infusion technics. Participation of plasma glucose in lactate production (% L----G) and the rate of peripheral glycogenolysis (GLY) was estimated in experiments using a mixture of 3-3H-glucose and 14C-glucose (U). PR did not interfere with the DNP-induced rise of body temperature (+ 4 degrees C), but completely blocked the rise of lactate production, the lactacidemia and the rise of GLY seen in DNP treated controls. PR significantly increased %L----G, prolonged the DNP induced hyperphosphataemia and it caused a decline of plasma glucose. The effects of the beta-blocker could be overcome by increasing the rate of DNP infusion. It is concluded that in DNP poisoning the beta-adrenergic system plays a major role in the elevated peripheral glycogenolysis and it helps to compensate for the loss of mitochondrial synthesis of ATP by greatly accelerating its cytoplasmic synthesis.", 
    "68": "The effects of the selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, practolol with intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA) and metoprolol without ISA, were studied on QT interval, heart rate, arterial pressure and cardiac arrhythmias during the induction of anaesthesia in 142 adults. In the control group, the QT interval was statistically significantly prolonged after thiopental, and the most marked prolongation occurred after suxamethonium. Neither practolol nor metoprolol alone affected the QT interval. Practolol 100 micrograms/kg i.v., but not 40 or 150 micrograms/kg i.v., almost completely reduced the prolongation of the QT interval after suxamethonium. In all doses of 20, 30 and 40 micrograms/kg i.v. metoprolol statistically significantly and dose-dependently reduced the prolongation of the QT interval after thiopental, suxamethonium and laryngoscopy, but the prolongation of the QT interval after intubation still occurred. Practolol and metoprolol alone statistically significantly reduced heart rate, but did not prevent the increase of heart rate after thiopental. The effects on arterial pressure were minimal. Neither practolol nor metoprolol prevented the cardiovascular intubation response. Ventricular ectopic beats after intubation occurred in 20% of the patients in the control group and their incidence ranged from 20 to 27% in the groups pretreated with practolol or metoprolol 20 micrograms/kg. In the groups pretreated with metoprolol 30 or 40 micrograms/kg, ventricular ectopic beats occurred in 5% and 8%, respectively. It is concluded that the selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blocking agents practolol with ISA, and especially metoprolol without ISA, reduced the prolongation of the QT interval after suxamethonium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The effects of chlorthalidone and metoprolol on fasting plasma lipids and lipoprotein levels were compared in two similar nonrandomized groups of patients with mild hypertension. Chlorthalidone therapy was associated with an increase in serum cholesterol of 8.1% (17 mg/dl), mainly reflecting an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. High-density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol decreased, but the difference between pre- and posttreatment levels did not reach statistical significance. Serum triglyceride (TG) concentration increased by 16% (20 mg/dl). Metoprolol therapy was not associated with changes in total, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels. Serum TG concentration increased by 22% (28 mg/dl), mainly due to an increase in VLDL-TG. Application of the Israel Ischemic Heart Disease Study data to these findings could predict only a very slight decrease in the 5-year estimated probability of myocardial infarction in the chlorthalidone-treated group. Metoprolol therapy has, theoretically, a more favorable influence on coronary heart disease risk status. These data suggest that the different forms of therapy for mild hypertension have a different effect on the theoretical coronary heart disease risk status, a fact that should be taken into consideration in the choice of medication.", 
    "70": "We studied the effects of acetylcholine on the transmembrane action potential and the contractile force of isolated human atrial fibers obtained at cardiac surgery. In 3 of 12 preparations, 10(-7)-10(-6) M acetylcholine induced a substantial increase in the contractile force following a brief initial decrease. Atropine diminished both the initial negative and the later positive inotropic effects induced by acetylcholine while propranolol abolished only the later effect.", 
    "71": "In a double-blind crossover study of 39 children with established migraine, there was no difference between treatment with propanolol and placebo as regards frequency, severity or average duration of migraine attacks. There was some evidence that propanolol increased the average length of headaches.", 
    "72": "Baroreflex sensitivity was measured by the heart rate response to the transient rise in blood pressure induced by phenylephrine, in 11 patients with carotid sinus syndrome, 6 patients with sick sinus syndrome and nine age and blood pressure matched controls. Patients with carotid sinus syndrome were divided into those with a hypersensitive carotid sinus reflex manifest as sinus arrest (n = 9) and those with a reflex manifest as atrioventricular block (n = 2). The mean gain of the baroreflex sensitivity was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in patients with carotid syndrome manifest as sinus arrest (12.7 +/- 5.1 ms . mmg-1) compared to that in patients with sick sinus syndrome (3.8 +/- 2.6 ms . mmHg-1) and controls (4.2 +/- 2.1 ms . mmHg-1). Patients with carotid sinus syndrome manifest as atrioventricular block did not have increased baroreflex sensitivity measured by their sinus node response (2.1 +/- 0.5 ms . mmHg-1). There was significant correlation (p less than 0.001) between the corrected carotid sinus inhibitory response to carotid sinus massage and the measurement of baroreflex sensitivity in the carotid sinus syndrome patients. Patients with carotid sinus syndrome manifest as reflex sinus arrest have an increased gain in baroreflex sensitivity for their age, which is not seen in patients with symptomatic sinoatrial disease. This study provides further evidence of a different mechanism of bradycardiac symptoms in patients with carotid sinus and sick sinus syndromes.", 
    "73": "The inhibition of horse plasma cholinesterase by propranolol showed characteristics which depended upon the identity of the substrate used. With butyrylthiocholine as substrate, the inhibition showed a first-order dependence on inhibitor concentration, and was characterized by a Ki of 8 microM (pH 7.4, 20 degrees C). With p-nitrophenylbutyrate as substrate, a biphasic v-1 versus [I] relationship was obtained. The biphasic curve could be resolved into two components, with apparent Ki's of 9 microM and 1.3 mM. Use of butyrylthiocholine as alternative substrate resulted in partial inhibition of p-nitrophenylbutyrate hydrolysis. Inhibition of butyrylthiocholine hydrolysis by p-nitrophenylbutyrate could be accounted for by pure competitive inhibition at two sites. The results were interpreted in terms of a four-site, low-symmetry model, in which two active sites could process both substrates, and the remaining sites could process only p-nitrophenylbutyrate.", 
    "74": "The effects of a single intravenous bolus of labetalol (0.5 mg/kg) on the cardiovascular, hyperglycaemic and adrenocortical responses to major colonic surgery were studied in five patients. Results were compared with five patients who received the same anaesthetic and had similar operations performed but who did not receive labetalol. It was observed that labetalol reduced the rises in heart rate and rate-pressure product that occur at the time of skin incision but that it did not reduce the rise in mean arterial pressure. The rises in blood glucose and plasma cortisol were significantly less in the labetalol group after 30 minutes of surgery (p less than 0.05).", 
    "75": "Adult female rats were given nicotine in drinking water for a minimum of 6 weeks prior to mating. The nicotine intake was then maintained at a level of 6.0 +/- 0.2 mg/kg/day throughout pregnancy. At birth the offspring were fostered to control females. Brain noradrenaline levels were elevated in cortex and hypothalamus in infancy but were within the control ranges in adult offspring. However, adrenergic receptor binding was significantly increased in cerebral cortex of adult offspring consistent with the view that prenatal nicotine exposure produces permanent changes in the functioning of central noradrenergic neurons. As in previous studies, the changes were found only in male offspring.", 
    "76": "The effects of chronic treatment with isoproterenol, reserpine, prenalterol, and terbutaline on rat parotid gland were investigated by electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis. Chronic isoproterenol treatment induced lower potassium and calcium concentrations in the acinar cells. The cells were enlarged and contained more and larger zymogen granules than acinar cells in the controls. The zymogen granules contained markedly less sulfur, potassium, and calcium than in control animals. Prenalterol had effects similar to those of isoproterenol, but less pronounced, whereas terbutaline had no significant effects. Chronic treatment with reserpine caused a decrease in calcium levels but did not affect potassium levels. The changes in elemental composition in parotid acinar cells after chronic treatment with isoproterenol and reserpine differed from those induced by the same treatment in the submandibular gland of the rat.", 
    "77": "The effects of timolol maleate administered intravenously on coronary and systemic haemodynamics, myocardial metabolism, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were assessed in 10 patients with confirmed coronary artery disease. Rapid atrial pacing to the onset of angina was performed in all patients. Timolol reduced cardiac output at rest and during pacing and reduced resting heart rate but did not affect arterial blood pressure. Left ventricular stroke work index fell during pacing. Coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged, but pulmonary artery diastolic pressure rose after timolol. The drug produced clinical improvement in nine of the 10 patients with prolongation of the mean pacing time to angina. There was evidence of improved myocardial metabolism with a change from production to extraction of lactate: Arterial noradrenaline concentrations at rest rose after timolol. In these patients with coronary artery disease timolol produced an increased tolerance to atrial pacing stress, which appears to be due to a combination of effects including reduced myocardial contractility and decreased lipolysis.", 
    "78": "Fourteen patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension and mild asthma were treated with Atenolol 50-125 mg/day for up to 8 months. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), rate pressure index (RPI), stress testing time (STT) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured before, during and after stress testing (ST) before and during treatment. Atenolol significantly lowered HR, SBP, DBP and RPI. It prolonged STT and had no effect on PEFR. Furthermore, Atenolol did not worsen the patient's asthma except for one patient. The drug did not interfere with the bronchodilatation effect of salbutamol. Atenolol can be used cautiously to treat hypertension in asthmatic patients under certain conditions."
