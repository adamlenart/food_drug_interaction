This study aims at mitigating doxorubicin toxicity on cardiac function through consuming a functional food. Five groups of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used along 22 weeks. Group I received 30 g/kg/day food enriched with yogurt, green tea extract, and carrots (80, 0.84, and 100 g/kg diet, respectively) from the first week, group II received carvedilol 30 mg/kg/day orally from week 17, group III received both carvedilol and tested food, and groups IV and V were +ve and -ve control groups, respectively. In week 17, cardiomyopathy was induced by i.p. injection of 2.5 mg/kg doxorubicin every 48 h for 2 weeks. Histopathological and electrophysiological examinations and biochemical analysis were done. Lipid peroxidation, antioxidant effect, heart failure compensatory mediators, and proinflammatory cytokines were assessed. Tested food normalized time between the start of Q wave and the end of T wave on electrocardiogram (QT interval) and heart rate compared to the doxorubicin group (P<.05). It also improved hypertrophy indicated by a significant (P<.05) decrease in heart/body weight ratio, angiotensin-II (Ang-II), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) serum levels. Histopathological examination of cardiac sections from the tested food group revealed less marked vacuolization and low perivascular fibrosis percentage (0.7803 \u00b1 0.04). A significant (P<.001) decrease in serum creatine kinase-membrane bound, lactate dehydrogenase, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels was observed in addition to an increase in serum Na(+)/K(+) ATP1A1 and cardiac reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Tested food also lowered the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) serum levels significantly (P<.01). Probiotic food containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, green tea, and carrots can improve membrane integrity and cardiac contractility in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy by decreasing TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MDA, increasing GSH, and modulating compensatory mediators such as Ang-II and ANP.", 
    "1": "The progression of cardiovascular disease could be regarded as following atherosclerosis-related and age-related pathways. The starting points for these pathways are different--risk factors or aortic ageing--but they conclude in the same way: end-stage heart disease. Together these interlinked pathways form the extended cardiovascular continuum. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors have been shown to interrupt or slow the progression of cardiovascular disease along one pathway, the cardiovascular atherosclerotic continuum. Cardiovascular protection with RAAS inhibitors varies; different RAAS inhibitors offer different levels of protection. Similarly, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) also have clearly shown protective effect of cardiovascular system, especially as it regards cerebrovascular disease risk. The AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) showed that a combination of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril and CCB amlodipine offered better cardiovascular protection in at-risk hypertensive patients than beta-blocker and thiazide. By attenuating the deleterious effects of cardiovascular disease at multiple stages of the extended cardiovascular continuum on top of lowering blood pressure (BP), perindopril and amlodipine could interrupt and slow the progression of cardiovascular disease. These antihypertensive agents have complementary vascular effects that enhance cardiovascular protection and reduce side-effects. Evidence from ASCOT shows that antihypertensive and vascular effects of amlodipine with and without perindopril have translated into real-life clinical benefits. A strategy using ACE inhibitors and CCBs, such as perindopril and amlodipine, to target multiple stages in both pathways of cardiovascular disease could effectively reduce cardiovascular risk and lower BP.",

    "6": "It had been known for decades that primordial follicles in mammalian ovaries are assembled with definite numbers and represent the ovarian reserve throughout the reproductive life. Intra-oocyte PI3K/mTOR pathways have been indicated to play a central role on the activation of primordial follicles. Genetic modified mouse models with chronic activation of PI3K/mTOR signals in primordial oocytes showed premature activation of all primordial follicles and eventually their exhaustion. On the other hand, this may suggest that, unlike chronic activation of PI3K/mTOR, its acute activation in infertility would activate primordial follicles, permitting fertility during the treatment. Previously, PI3K stimulators were reported as a temporary measure to accelerate primordial follicle activation and follicular development in both mouse and human, and were applied in the treatment of infertility in premature ovarian failure (POF) patients. To address whether mTOR stimulators could play similar role in the process, we transiently treated neonatal and aged mouse ovaries with mTOR stimulators-phosphatidic acid (PA) and propranolol. Our results demonstrated the stimulators increased activation of primordial follicles and the production of progeny. Human ovarian cortex cubes were also treated with mTOR or/and PI3K stimulators in vitro. When they were used separately, both of them showed similar promotive effects on primordial follicles. Surprisingly, after joint-treatment with the 2 kinds of stimulators together, synergistic effects on follicular development were observed. Based on increased efficiency of follicular activation in humans, here we propose in vitro transient treatment with mTOR and PI3K stimulators as an optimized protocol for the application in different clinical conditions with limited follicle reserve.", 
    "7": "Severe autonomic dysfunction, including the loss of control of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems, is a common comorbidity of stroke and other bleeding head injuries. Previous studies suggest that this collapse of autonomic control may be caused by thrombin acting on astrocytic protease-activated receptors (PAR1) in the hindbrain. Using calcium imaging and electrophysiological techniques, we evaluated the mechanisms by which astrocytic PAR1s modulate the activity of presynaptic vagal afferent terminals and postsynaptic neurons in the rat nucleus of the solitary tract (NST). Our calcium-imaging data show that astrocytic and neuronal calcium levels increase after brain slices are treated with the PAR1 agonist SFLLRN-NH2. This increase in activity is blocked by pretreating the slices with the glial metabolic blocker fluorocitrate. In addition, PAR1-activated astrocytes communicate directly with NST neurons by releasing glutamate. Calcium responses to SFLLRN-NH2 in the astrocytes and neurons significantly increase after bath application of the excitatory amino acid transporter blocker DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) and significantly decrease after bath application of the NMDA receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (DL-AP5). Furthermore, astrocytic glutamate activates neuronal GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. Voltage-clamp recordings of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) from NST neurons show that astrocytes control presynaptic vagal afferent excitability directly under resting and activated conditions. Fluorocitrate significantly decreases mEPSC frequency and SFLLRN-NH2 significantly increases mEPSC frequency. These data show that astrocytes act within a tripartite synapse in the NST, controlling the excitability of both postsynaptic NST neurons and presynaptic vagal afferent terminals.", 
    "8": "The field of extracranial vascular anomalies is considered as special focus of pediatric otolaryngology and it has shown a rapid development during the last years. The reason for this interest is finally also due to the global acceptance of the classification introduced by the ISSVA (International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies). Hemangiomas are the most frequently observed vascular tumors. Today the systemic propranolol therapy is mostly used for therapy of hemangiomas requiring treatment. Increasingly, the topical application of beta blocker is discussed while the benefit in the head and neck seems to be limited. Vascular malformations are classified according to the morphology of the affected part of the vascular system in arterial, venous, arterio-venous, lymphatic, capillary, and combined vascular malformations. Conventional surgery, sclerosing therapy, and laser treatment are invasive options for the treatment of lymphatic malformations. The options for the treatment of venous malformations could be significantly improved during the last years. In this context, the use of Nd:YAG laser, the conservative treatment of the localized disseminated intravascular coagulation with low-molecular weight heparin, the re-discovery of bleomycin as effective sclerosing agent, and the improvement of alcohol-based embolization agents must be mentioned. Today the treatment with dye laser is the preferred therapy for capillary malformations and it is superior to other therapeutic options as for example photodynamic therapy. Arterio-venous malformations as representatives for high-flow lesions are the high-risk lesions. Frequently they are compared to malignant head and neck tumors, in particular when a curative treatment can no longer be assured because of diffuse or multifocal extent and when the disease shows a progressive course. The combined treatment of embolization and surgical resection and if necessary consecutive defect reconstruction have turned out to be appropriate for arterio-venous malformations. Incurable findings are still a major challenge. Despite the introduction of antiangiogenetic drugs in oncology, the medicamentous therapeutic approach could not be established for arterio-venous malformations up to now.",

Carvedilol, a widely used and effective anti-hypertrophic drug, simultaneously blocks \u03b2-adrenergic receptors non-specifically in various organs. Likewise, non-specific genome-wide downregulation of p53 expression by specific siRNA efficiently abrogates cardiac hypertrophy but results in extensive tumorigenesis affecting bystander organs. Therefore, delivery of such therapeutics had been a challenge in treating cardiovascular dysfunction. Cardiac tissue engineering was successfully accomplished in this study, by encapsulating such bioactive molecules with a stearic acid modified Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) nanopolymer conjugated to a homing peptide for delivery to hypertrophied cardiomyocytes in vivo. The peptide precisely targeted cardiomyocytes while CMC served as the vector mediator to pathological myocardium. Controlled delivery of active therapeutic payloads within cardiomyocytes resulted in effective regression of cardiac hypertrophy.

Multiparticulates in pellet form for incorporation with or without the osmogent were manufactured by three methods and then used to coat a polymeric membrane. Results demonstrated that drug/osmogent-containing pellets manufactured by the extrusion/spheronization method with incorporation of the osmogent were optimal. The lag time (tL) to initiate pulsatile release is regulated by tL=l(2)/(6\u00d7D), which is dependent on the coating levels (l(2)) and plasticizer content (D). The pulsatile release pattern was found to be dependent on the osmotic pressure (osmogent), drug solubility, and mechanical properties of the polymeric membrane (elasticity and toughness). Omeprazole with lower water solubility could not generate sufficient osmotic pressure to create a crack in the membrane to activate pulsatile release, whereas the two other model drugs with higher solubilities could. But adsorption of omeprazole sodium on Eudragit(\u00ae) RS via charge-charge interactions led the its incomplete release. Finally, with 4% osmogent of NaCl added, a lag time in a range from 0 to 12h proportionally regulated by varying both the membrane thickness and plasticizer level initiated the complete pulsatile release of propranolol HCl. In conclusion, a multiparticulate pulsatile drug delivery system activated by a rupturable controlled-release membrane via osmotic pressure was successfully developed, and clinical applications of chronotherapy with drugs like propranolol HCl are expected.",

The effects of chemical substances on embryo survival and development are generally evaluated manually through microscopic observation by an expert and documented by several typical photographs. Here, we present a methodology to automatically classify brightfield images of wildtype zebrafish embryos according to their defects by using an image analysis approach based on supervised machine learning. We show that, compared to manual classification, automatic classification results in 90 to 100% agreement with consensus voting of biological experts in nine out of eleven considered defects in 3 days old zebrafish larvae. Automation of the analysis and classification of zebrafish embryo pictures reduces the workload and time required for the biological expert and increases the reproducibility and objectivity of this classification.", 
    "61": "The current guidelines for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) recommended that \u03b2-blocker should be used in patients with decreased left ventricular (LV) systolic function for long-term period. However, the effect of \u03b2-blocker in AMI patients with preserved LV systolic function is uncertain. We sought to assess the long-term effect of \u03b2-blocker in AMI patients with preserved LV systolic function. During the follow-up period (1997-2011), total 3508 patients were performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Of these patients, 424 AMI patients with preserved LV systolic function [ejection fraction (EF) > 40 %] were analyzed. Median follow-up period was 4.7 years. Then, patients were divided into two groups (\u03b2-blocker group 197 patients and no-\u03b2-blocker group 227 patients). However, there are substantial differences in baseline characteristics between two groups. Therefore, we calculated propensity score to match the patients in \u03b2-blocker and no-\u03b2-blocker groups. After post-match patients (N = 206, 103 matched pair), \u03b2-blocker therapy significantly reduced cardiac death compared with no-\u03b2-blocker [hazard ratio (HR) 0.40, p = 0.04], whereas \u03b2-blocker therapy was not associated with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause death. \u03b2-Blocker is an effective treatment for AMI patients who underwent PCI with preserved LV systolic function.",

Non-linear methods based on chaos theory have been used during the last decades as markers for risk stratification. However, interpretation of these nonlinear methods in terms of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is not fully established. In this work we study linear and non-linear HRV indices during ANS blockades in order to assess their relation with sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. Power spectral content in low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) bands of HRV, as well as correlation dimension, sample and approximate entropies were computed in a database of subjects during single and dual ANS blockade with atropine and/or propranolol. Parasympathetic blockade caused a significant decrease in the low and high frequency power of HRV, as well as in correlation dimension and sample and approximate entropies. Sympathetic blockade caused a significant increase in approximate entropy. Sympathetic activation due to postural change from supine to standing caused a significant decrease in all the investigated non-linear indices and a significant increase in the normalized power in the low frequency band. The other investigated linear indices did not show significant changes. Results suggest that parasympathetic activity has a direct relation with sample and approximate entropies.", 
    "63": "The potassium channels were recently found to be inhibited by animal toxin-like human \u03b2-defensin 2 (hBD2), the first defensin blocker of potassium channels. Whether there are other defensin blockers from different organisms remains an open question. Here, we reported the potassium channel-blocking plectasin, the first defensin blocker from a fungus. Based on the similar cysteine-stabilized alpha-beta (CS\u03b1\u03b2) structure between plectasin and scorpion toxins acting on potassium channels, we found that plectasin could dose-dependently block Kv1.3 channel currents through electrophysiological experiments. Besides Kv1.3 channel, plectasin could less inhibit Kv1.1, Kv1.2, IKCa, SKCa3, hERG and KCNQ channels at the concentration of 1 \u03bc\u039c. Using mutagenesis and channel activation experiments, we found that outer pore region of Kv1.3 channel was the binding site of plectasin, which is similar to the interacting site of Kv1.3 channel recognized by animal toxin blockers. Together, these findings not only highlight the novel function of plectasin as a potassium channel inhibitor, but also imply that defensins from different organisms functionally evolve to be a novel kind of potassium channel inhibitors.",

Non-selective \u03b2-AR blockers have greater benefits on survival than selective \u03b21-AR blockers in chronic HF patients, indicating that \u03b22-AR activation contributes to SCD in HF. This study investigated the role of \u03b22-AR activation on repolarization and ventricular arrhythmia (VA) in the experimental HF model. The guinea pig HF was induced by descending aortic banding. The effective refractoriness period (ERP), corrected QT (QTc) and the incidence of VA were examined using Langendorff and programmed electrical stimulation. Ikr and APD were recorded by the whole cell patch clamp. Selective \u03b22-AR agonist salbutamol significantly increased the incidence of VA, prolonged QTc and shortened ERP. These effects could be prevented by the selective \u03b22-AR antagonist, ICI118551. Salbutamol prolonged APD90 and reduced Ikr in guinea pig HF myocytes. The antagonists of cAMP (Rp-cAMP) and PKA (KT5720) attenuated Ikr inhibition and APD prolongation induced by salbutamol. However, the antagonists of Gi protein (PTX) and PDE III (amrinone) showed opposite effects. This study indicates that \u03b22-AR activation increases the incidence of VA in the experimental HF model via activation of Gs/cAMP/PKA and/or inhibition of Gi/PDE pathways.",

Using information on prescriptions, each individual's observation time was then divided into periods exposed or unexposed to BB and the relative AMI incidence rate ratios (IRR) of BB exposure were estimated by conditional Poisson regression. The IRR (rate of recurrent AMI in exposed versus unexposed periods) was 0.79 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.90, P=0.001). Various sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness to possible failure of assumptions, ie, considering only first recurrences (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88, P<0.001), excluding cardiovascular fatalities (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89, P<0.001), and excluding individuals with long hospital admissions (IRR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.83, P=0.002).",

This case report is about one such drug interaction of this innocent yet malicious drug, which resulted in the death of a 14-year-old girl. Both \u03b2-adrenergic blockers and succinylcholine are known to cause hyperkalemia. Life-threatening hyperkalemia in susceptible individuals who have been administered succinylcholine has the most severe effect on the myocardium and can result in asystole with minimal chances of resuscitation. Both succinylcholine and a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, have the propensity to affect the transcellular redistribution of potassium which can result in hyperkalemia.

Of the 1003 studies yielded by our initial search, two met inclusion criteria and provided sufficient data. These were randomized double-blinded studies (n=92) comparing intravenous diltiazem with intravenous metoprolol. The combined relative risk of acute rate control by diltiazem versus metoprolol was 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.2-2.6).

    "71": "The organic anion transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2), a membrane drug transporter expressed on important organs (such as the brain, kidney, and intestine) may be a key element in the disposition of drugs. Previous studies demonstrated that it could transport a broad spectrum of substrates, including endogenous molecules and clinically relevant drugs, such as several \u03b2-blockers and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. The primary objective of this study was to investigate OATP1A2 transport activity using rosuvastatin as a probe substrate and evaluate competitive inhibition of its transport by \u03b2-blockers. Rosuvastatin transport was saturable, with a Km of 60.2 \u00b5M. With the exception of carvedilol (IC50 of 3.2 \u00b5M), all of the other \u03b2-blockers that were evaluated had a small or insignificant effect on OATP1A2-mediated uptake of rosuvastatin. Carvedilol differs from the other \u03b2-blockers by the tricyclic moiety in its chemical structure. As a secondary objective, the transport of a series of tricyclic compounds by OATP1A2 and their potential for rosuvastatin transport inhibition were evaluated. Tricyclic compounds were not OATP1A2 substrates. On the other hand, tricyclic compounds with a short aliphatic amine chain inhibited OATP1A2-mediated rosuvastatin transport. Our data suggest that these drugs may modulate the transport of OATP1A2 substrates and may affect drug actions.",

Convenient methods to assess the efficacy of potentially therapeutic reagents for GPCRs are strongly required for high-throughput screening (HTS) assay. We recently developed a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative method for detecting potential chemicals that act on GPCRs using split luciferase complementation. In principle, this is based on the detection of interactions of GPCR with \u03b2-arrestin, which translocates to the activated GPCRs. This method can facilitate the construction of HTS systems in a multi-well plate format. Particularly, the method is compatible with single-cell imaging and animal models and even deeper tissues such as organs, because of its high sensitivity, suggesting that promising candidates from HTS assay can be moved easily to the next phase for additional analysis. This system can contribute to the effective evaluation of potentially therapeutic reagents and expedite the development of new drugs for GPCRs.",

Multiparametric analysis of the DMR agonist profiles reveals divergent pharmacology of a panel of \u03b22AR agonists. DMR profiling using catechol as a conformational probe detects the presence of multiple conformations of the \u03b22AR.

    "83": "A general design methodology for chromatographic three fraction separation by application of the three column intermittent simulated moving bed (3C-ISMB) cascade is proposed and experimentally validated by studying the purification of an intermediately retained stereoisomer of nadolol, from an equimolar mixture of its four stereoisomers. The theoretical part shows that the 3C-ISMB cascade can be easily designed by applying Triangle Theory. Moreover, a re-scaling approach for the second stage is proposed so as to account for the fact that the feed flow rates to stage 2 are generally higher as compared to stage 1 due to dilution in the latter. Scaling the columns of the second stage accordingly enables to run both stages under optimal conditions with respect to switching time and step ratio, which is an important advantage as compared to integrated ternary processes. The experimental part starts with studying the linear adsorption behavior of nadolol in heptane/ethanol/DEA on Chiralpak AD for varying ratios of heptane and ethanol. Based on that, a solvent composition of Hept/EtOH/DEA 30/70/0.3 (v/v/v) is selected and the competitive multi-component Langmuir isotherm of the quaternary mixture is determined by frontal analysis. The resulting isotherm parameters are used to design several first stage experiments aiming at removal of the most retained component. The resulting ternary intermediate product is reprocessed in several second stage experiments studying various configurations. Finally, the dilution of the intermediate product with Hept/DEA yielding a solvent composition of Hept/EtOH/DEA 60/40/0.3 (v/v/v) is examined showing that the resulting increase in retention is beneficial for final product purities. Moreover, the reduction in viscosity compensates for the dilution as it enables higher flow rates. Dilution of the intermediate product is hence the best option, yielding highest overall cascade productivity (2.10gl(-1)h(-1)) and highest product purity (97.8%) requiring a specific solvent consumption of 12l/g of product.", 
    "84": "Spider venoms contain a plethora of insecticidal peptides that act on neuronal ion channels and receptors. Because of their high specificity, potency and stability, these peptides have attracted much attention as potential environmentally friendly insecticides. Although many insecticidal spider venom peptides have been isolated, the molecular target, mode of action and structure of only a small minority have been explored. Sf1a, a 46-residue peptide isolated from the venom of the tube-web spider Segesteria florentina, is insecticidal to a wide range of insects, but nontoxic to vertebrates. In order to investigate its structure and mode of action, we developed an efficient bacterial expression system for the production of Sf1a. We determined a high-resolution solution structure of Sf1a using multidimensional 3D/4D NMR spectroscopy. This revealed that Sf1a is a knottin peptide with an unusually large \u03b2-hairpin loop that accounts for a third of the peptide length. This loop is delimited by a fourth disulfide bond that is not commonly found in knottin peptides. We showed, through mutagenesis, that this large loop is functionally critical for insecticidal activity. Sf1a was further shown to be a selective inhibitor of insect voltage-gated sodium channels, consistent with its 'depressant' paralytic phenotype in insects. However, in contrast to the majority of spider-derived sodium channel toxins that function as gating modifiers via interaction with one or more of the voltage-sensor domains, Sf1a appears to act as a pore blocker.",

Optic disc pit-like maculopathy can occur in patients with normal-tension glaucoma in the absence of obvious congenital anomalies of the disc. The intraretinal fluid might have migrated from the vitreous cavity through a microhole at the optic disc margin or in the area with the nerve fiber defect.

The starter dose of propranolol made 0.5 mg/kg per day with further increase to 1.5 mg/kg per day; the preparation was prescripted at the age of 2 days of life. Episodes of decrease in cardiac rate to 95 b/min are noted among side effects. The child was dismissed for out-patient observation at the age of 12 days of life in a stable state. The positive dynamics is registered during ultrasound investigation in 6 months after initiation of treatment: lesion was significantly decreased in the size, and there was a considerable decrease in a blood flow. Treatment by propranolol in a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per day was continued. Modern data on possible mechanisms of propranolol effect at haemangiomas in children, regimen, side effects and complications are provided in discussion.

    "87": "Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are strongly expressed in the circumventricular organs (CVOs), and these structures may play an important role in sensing plasma sodium levels. Here, the potent ENaC blocker amiloride was injected intraperitoneally in rats and 2h later, the c-Fos activation pattern in the CVOs was studied. Amiloride elicited dose-related activation in the area postrema (AP) but only ~10% of the rats showed c-Fos activity in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and subfornical organ (SFO). Tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (catecholamine) AP neurons were activated, but tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive (serotonin) neurons were unaffected. The AP projects to FoxP2-expressing neurons in the dorsolateral pons which include the pre-locus coeruleus nucleus and external lateral part of the parabrachial nucleus; both cell groups were c-Fos activated following systemic injections of amiloride. In contrast, another AP projection target--the aldosterone-sensitive neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius which express the enzyme 11-\u03b2-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD2) were not activated. As shown here, plasma concentrations of amiloride used in these experiments were near or below the IC50 level for ENaCs. Amiloride did not induce changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or regional vascular resistance, so sensory feedback from the cardiovascular system was probably not a causal factor for the c-Fos activity seen in the CVOs. In summary, amiloride may have a dual effect on sodium homeostasis causing a loss of sodium via the kidney and inhibiting sodium appetite by activating the central satiety pathway arising from the AP.",

The objectives of this study were to determine the current use of oral propranolol and topical timolol by pediatric dermatologists in an outpatient setting and to compare current propranolol use with published propranolol consensus guidelines. An electronic survey was sent to pediatric dermatologists in May and June 2013. One hundred forty-nine pediatric dermatologists responded to the survey, a 79% response rate. Of the respondents, 96% prescribed oral propranolol, but 75% did not follow consensus guidelines exactly; recommended history, physical examination, initial dose, and frequency varied. The dose of propranolol was usually titrated up to goal dose as recommended (89%). Fifty-six percent monitored vital signs in patients after the initial dose and 49% continued to monitor vital signs in their clinic after each dose escalation, which did not meet consensus guideline recommendations. Ninety-one percent reported using topical timolol for the treatment of IH and 66% responded they had used topical timolol in conjunction with oral propranolol to treat IH. The most common indication was superficial hemangiomas (97%). Most practitioners (74%) did not routinely monitor heart rate or blood pressure in infants treated with topical timolol. This study highlights the variability in prescribing and monitoring practices of physicians using propranolol for the treatment of IHs and demonstrates that topical timolol is commonly used alone and in conjunction with oral propranolol to treat IHs.",

Two weeks after successful completion of the RCA revascularization, the original collateral circulation in the blood flow from the LMC to RCA became two-way flow. Under the safe and reliable protective condition, staged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with 6F XB3.0 guiding catheter and rapamycin-eluting stents was applied to treat the LMCL. 9-month postoperative follow-up with coronary computed tomographic imaging showed no restenosis inside the original stent, without any myocardial ischemic event.

    "110": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) during reperfusion (rVF) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an infrequent but serious event that complicates coronary interventions. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical predictors of rVF in an unselected population of patients with STEMI treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Consecutive patients with STEMI admitted to a tertiary care hospital for primary PCI from 2007 to 2012 were retrospectively assessed for the presence of rVF. Admission electrocardiograms, stored in a digital format, were analyzed for a maximal ST-segment elevation in a single lead and the sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and angiographic characteristics were tested for associations with rVF using logistic regression analysis. Among 3,724 patients with STEMI admitted from 2007 to 2012, 71 (1.9%) had rVF. In univariate analysis, history of myocardial infarction, aspirin and \u03b2-blocker use, VF before PCI, left main coronary artery disease, inferior myocardial infarction localization, symptom-to-balloon time <360 minutes, maximal ST-segment elevation in a single lead >300 \u03bcV, and sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads >1,500 \u03bcV were associated with increased risk for rVF. In a multivariate analysis, sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads >1500 \u03bcV (odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 9.41, p = 0.006) before PCI remained an independent predictor of rVF. In-hospital mortality was 18.3% in the rVF group and 3.3% in the group without VF (p <0.001), but rVF was not an independent predictor of in-hospital death. In conclusion, the magnitude of ST-segment elevation before PCI for STEMI independently predicts rVF and should be considered in periprocedural arrhythmic risk assessment. Despite higher in-hospital mortality in patients with rVF, rVF itself has no independent prognostic value for prognosis.",

However, there have been no detailed studies related to signaling pathways downstream of \u03b2-adrenoceptors responsible for central sympathetic outflow. In the present study, we pharmacologically examined the possibility that centrally administered isoproterenol can induce elevations of plasma noradrenaline levels in a brain prostaglandin-dependent manner. In addition, we also examined whether or not intracerebroventricular administration of isoproterenol could release endogenously synthesized prostaglandin (PG) E2 in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by using the brain microdialysis technique combined with liquid chromatography-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS(n)). Under urethane anesthesia, a femoral venous line was inserted for infusion of saline and a femoral arterial line was inserted for collecting blood samples. Next, animals were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for application of test agents. Catecholamines in the plasma were extracted by alumina absorption and were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Quantification of PGE2 in rat PVN microdialysates was performed by the LC-ITMS(n) method. We demonstrated that centrally administered isoproterenol-induced elevations of plasma noradrenaline could be mediated via activation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors and the downstream phospholipase A2-cyclooxygenase pathway. Furthermore, PGE2 in the PVN and the PGE2 receptor EP3 subtype appear to play an important role in the process. Our results suggest that central isoproterenol-induced sympathetic outflow is mediated via brain PGE2 in a PGE2 receptor EP3 subtype-dependent manner.",

Resting electrocardiography, 24 hours Holter monitorization, echocardiography were performed, and serum levels of cardiac troponin T, creatine kinase, CKMB, brain natriuretic peptide and tacrolimus were measured. The median time to palpitation after kidney transplantation was 30 days in seven patients, and one patient complained of palpitation five years after transplantation. Cardiovascular assessment revealed sinus tachycardia in all patients. Beta-blocker was instituted in five patients. After two months all patients were asymptomatic and their pulse rates were within normal limits. Transient sinus tachycardia is a frequent adverse event during tacrolimus therapy in children and young adults, at therapeutic levels. Patients may benefit from beta-blockers.", 
    "113": "\u03b21-Adrenergic receptor (\u03b21-AR) stimulation increases apoptosis in cardiomyocytes through activation of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins function as important regulators of myocardial gene expression. Previously, we reported that PKA signaling directly represses MEF2 activity. We determined whether (a) MEF2 has a pro-survival function in cardiomyocytes, and (b) whether \u03b2-adrenergic/PKA signaling modulates MEF2 function in cardiomyocytes. Initially, we observed that siRNA-mediated gene silencing of MEF2 induces cardiomyocyte apoptosis as indicated by flow cytometry. \u03b21-AR activation by isoproterenol represses MEF2 activity and promotes apoptosis in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. Importantly, \u03b21-AR mediated apoptosis was abrogated in cardiomyocytes expressing a PKA-resistant form of MEF2D (S121/190A). We also observed that a \u03b21-blocker, Atenolol, antagonizes isoproterenol-induced apoptosis while concomitantly enhancing MEF2 transcriptional activity. \u03b2-AR stimulation modulated MEF2 cellular localization in cardiomyocytes and this effect was reversed by \u03b2-blocker treatment. Furthermore, Kruppel-like factor 6, a MEF2 target gene in the heart, functions as a downstream pro-survival factor in cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that (a) MEF2 has an important pro-survival role in cardiomyocytes, and (b) \u03b2-adrenergic signaling antagonizes the pro-survival function of MEF2 in cardiomyocytes and \u03b2-blockers promote it. These observations have important clinical implications that may contribute to novel strategies for preventing cardiomyocyte apoptosis associated with heart pathology.",

There are a few published studies which report AKI following non-suprainguinal vascular procedures, but these studies have not investigated predictors of AKI, including anti-hypertensive medications and other comorbidities, in the hypertensive population alone. We sought to identify independent predictors of post-operative AKI in non-suprainguinal vascular surgery patients with a pre-operative history of hypertension. We performed univariate (chi-squared, or Fisher's exact testing) and multivariate (binary logistic regression) statistical analysis of prospectively collected data from 243 adult hypertensive patients who underwent non-suprainguinal vascular surgery (lower limb amputation or peripheral artery bypass surgery) at a tertiary hospital between 2008 and 2011 in an attempt to identify possible associations between comorbidity, acute pre-operative antihypertensive medication administration, and post-operative AKI (a post-operative increase in serum creatinine of \u2265 25 % above the pre-operative measurement) in these patients. The incidence of post-operative AKI in this study was 5.3 % (95 % Confidence Interval: 3.2-8.9 %).

    "120": "The basic design used in our human fear-conditioning studies on disrupting reconsolidation includes testing over different phases across three consecutive days. On day 1 - the fear acquisition phase, healthy participants are exposed to a series of picture presentations. One picture stimulus (CS1+) is repeatedly paired with an aversive electric stimulus (US), resulting in the acquisition of a fear association, whereas another picture stimulus (CS2-) is never followed by an US. On day 2 - the memory reactivation phase, the participants are re-exposed to the conditioned stimulus without the US (CS1-), which typically triggers a conditioned fear response. After the memory reactivation we administer an oral dose of 40 mg of propranolol HCl, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist that indirectly targets the protein synthesis required for reconsolidation by inhibiting the noradrenaline-stimulated CREB phosphorylation. On day 3 - the test phase, the participants are again exposed to the unreinforced conditioned stimuli (CS1- and CS2-) in order to measure the fear-reducing effect of the manipulation. This retention test is followed by an extinction procedure and the presentation of situational triggers to test for the return of fear. Potentiation of the eye blink startle reflex is measured as an index for conditioned fear responding. Declarative knowledge of the fear association is measured through online US expectancy ratings during each CS presentation. In contrast to extinction learning, disrupting reconsolidation targets the original fear memory thereby preventing the return of fear. Although the clinical applications are still in their infancy, disrupting reconsolidation of fear memory seems to be a promising new technique with the prospect to persistently dampen the expression of fear memory in patients suffering from anxiety disorders and other psychiatric disorders.",

All patients were treated with systemic propranolol at a dose of 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg, and the drug was taken once per day. The length of treatment was 8.2 months on average and ranged from 6 to 12 months. The follow-up visits were scheduled monthly after discharge. Changes were recorded during the 3-day hospitalization, including systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, and blood glucose level. The treatment responses were scored according to a 4-point scale system as very good, good, mild, or no response. The adverse effects after medication administration were evaluated and managed accordingly.",

When pretreatment and post-treatment values were compared, there was no significant decrease in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures and mean heart rate (all P > .05). The decreases in the cardiovascular parameters were not commonly associated with observable clinical symptoms. No major collateral effects were observed, and no infants were withdrawn from treatment because of side effects.",

Therefore oral propranolol was an effective and safe treatment for IHs, particularly for early intervention suitable for severe IHs.", 
    "146": "Recent studies have proposed the potential role of 5-HT2B receptor (5-HT2BR) blockade in alleviating myocardial dysfunction; hitherto, the regulatory pathway for its protective effect has remained enigmatic. In the present study, we sought to investigate the role of SB-204741, a 5-HT2BR blocker in isoproterenol-induced myocardial remodeling in rats and its cross-talk with apoptosis and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPKs)/heat shock proteins (HSPs) pathway. To assess this hypothesis, we measured the effect of SB-204741 (0.25-1.0\u00a0mg/kg/day, i.p.) in isoproterenol (85\u00a0mg/kg/day, s.c.)-induced myocardial remodeling in rats. SB-204741 dose dependently improved hemodynamic and ventricular functions following isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury. This amelioration was well substantiated with reduced expression of 5-HT2B, inflammatory proteins (NF-\u03baBp65, IKK-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and Cox-2), MAPKs (p-p38/p38 and p-JNK/JNK ratio) accompanied with increased protein expression of HSPs (\u03b1B-crystallin, Hsp27 and Hsp70), autophagy (LC3 and Beclin-1) and p-ERK/ERK ratio. Additionally, SB-204741 inhibited apoptotic signaling pathway as there was decreased DAPI/TUNEL positivity and protein expression of cytochrome c, Bax, and caspase-3 along with increased Bcl-2 expression. Preservation of histopathological and ultrastructural components, normalization of nitric oxide level, endogenous antioxidants and myocyte injury marker enzymes were also observed. In conclusion, inhibition of apoptosis via modulation of MAPKs/HSPs is essential for 5-HT2BR blockade mediated cardioprotective effect.", 
    "147": "Many clinically important differences exist between beta blockers. B1-selectivity is of clinical interest because at clinically used doses, b1- selective agents block cardiac b-receptors while having minor effects on bronchial and vascular b-receptors. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents significantly decrease the frequency and duration of angina pectoris, instead the prognostic benefit of beta-blockers in stable angina has been extrapolated from studies of post myocardial infarction but has not yet been documented without left ventricular disfunction or previous myocardial infarction. Organic nitrates are among the oldest drugs, but they still remain a widely used adjuvant in the treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease. While their efficacy in relieving angina pectoris symptoms in acute settings and in preventing angina before physical or emotional stress is undisputed, the chronic use of nitrates has been associated with potentially important side effects such as tolerance and endothelial dysfunction. B-blockers are the firstline anti-anginal therapy in stable stable angina patients without contraindications, while nitrates are the secondline anti-anginal therapy. Despite 150 years of clinical practice, they remain fascinating drugs, which in a chronic setting still deserve investigation. This review evaluated pharmacotherapy and indications of Beta-blockers and nitrates in stable angina.",

To replace, refine or reduce (3Rs) the large numbers of fish used in in vivo uptake studies an effective in vitro screen is required that mimics the function of the teleost gill. This study uses a rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) primary gill cell culture system grown on permeable inserts, which tolerates apical freshwater thus mimicking the intact organ, to assess the uptake and efflux of pharmaceuticals across the gill. Bidirectional transport studies in media of seven pharmaceuticals (propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol, formoterol, terbutaline, ranitidine and imipramine) showed they were transported transcellularly across the epithelium. However, studies conducted in water showed enhanced uptake of propranolol, ranitidine and imipramine. Concentration-equilibrated conditions without a concentration gradient suggested that a proportion of the uptake of propranolol and imipramine is via a carrier-mediated process. Further study using propranolol showed that its transport is pH-dependent and at very low environmentally relevant concentrations (ng L(-1)), transport deviated from linearity. At higher concentrations, passive uptake dominated. Known inhibitors of drug transport proteins; cimetidine, MK571, cyclosporine A and quinidine inhibited propranolol uptake, whilst amantadine and verapamil were without effect. Together this suggests the involvement of specific members of SLC and ABC drug transporter families in pharmaceutical transport.",

PACAP-38 was administered into the lateral brain ventricle and the behavior of the animals was measured 3h later. The possible involvement of transmitters was measured by pretreating the animals with receptor blockers which alone did not influence the task, but in the doses used were effective with other neuropeptides. The receptor antagonist PACAP 6-38 (a PAC 1/VPAC2 receptor antagonist of PACAP-38 receptor), haloperidol (a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist), phenoxybenzamine (an \u03b11/\u03b12\u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist), propranolol(a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist), bicuculline (a gamma-aminobutyric acid subunit A receptor antagonist), methysergide (a nonselective 5-HT2 serotonergic receptor antagonist), atropine (a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist), naloxone (a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist) and nitro-l-arginine which acts by blocking the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, thereby blocking the nitric oxide synthesis, were tested. The following parameters were measured: the time spent in open arms/the time spent in total entries. PACAP-38 decreased the ratio of time spent in open arms to the time spent in total entries, indicating anxiogenic action. The total number of entries was not altered significantly either by PACAP-38 or by the receptor blockers. The following receptor blockers diminished the action of PACAP-38: PACAP 6-38,haloperidol, methysergide, naloxone and nitro-l-arginine. Pretreatment with atropine, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and bicuculline did not influence the action of PACAP-38 on the time spent in open arms. The results demonstrate that PACAP-38 administered into the lateral brain ventricle exerted anxiogenic action at 3 h following treatment. Pretreatment of the animals with various receptor blockers indicated that a nonselective dopaminergic receptor antagonist, 5HT2 serotonergic and opioid receptors, nitric oxide and PAC1 receptors are involved in the anxiogenic action induced by PACAP-38.", 
    "155": "Metoprolol (MTP), a hypertension depressor, has been increasingly detected even after conventional water treatment processes. In this study, the removal of MTP was compared using chlorination (Cl2), UV-C photolysis, and UV/chlorination (Cl2/UV) reactions. The results showed that the UV/chlorination reaction was most effective for MTP removal. MTP removal during UV/chlorination reaction was optimized under various conditions of UV intensity (1.1-4.4 mW/cm(2)), chlorine dose (1-5 mg/L as Cl2), pH (2-9), and dissolved organic matter (DOM, 1-4 mgC/L) using a two-level factorial design with 16 experimental combinations of the four factors. Among the factors examined, DOM scavenging by OH radicals was the most dominant in terms of MTP removal during UV/chlorination reaction. The established model fit well with the experimental results using to various water samples including surface waters, filtered and tap water samples. The optimized conditions (UV intensity=4.4 mW/cm(2), [Cl2]=5 mg/L, pH 7, and [DOM]=0.8-1.1 mgC/L) of the model removed more than 78.9% of MTP for filtered water samples during UV/chlorination reaction. Using LC-MS/MS, five byproducts of MTP (molecular weight: 171, 211, 309, 313, and 341, respectively) were identified during UV/chlorination reaction. Based on this information, the MTP transformation mechanism during UV/chlorination was suggested. Our results imply that applying UV/chlorination process after filtration stage in the water treatment plant (WTP) would be the most appropriate for effective removal of MTP.",

Approximately 40% of patients with elevated IOP will require more than one medication to obtain a modest 20% reduction in IOP, and as a result, some patients may require two medications, provided in either two separate bottles or in one bottle with the use of fixed-combination therapies. Each therapy has its own unique safety and efficacy profile. Topical beta-blockers have a particularly favorable ocular-tolerability profile, and several studies of fixed-combination medications containing the beta-blocker timolol maleate have shown a lower prevalence of some ocular adverse events for the fixed-combination therapy compared to the non-beta-blocker individual component. In this review, we examined clinical data pertaining to the ocular surface tolerability of fixed-combination medications containing timolol maleate in comparison to the individual components. In particular, preference was given to prospective, randomized, multicenter trials of 3 months in duration or longer that compared a fixed-combination therapy to monotherapy with the individual components. A review of the literature revealed that some fixed-combination therapies can provide a reduced risk of common side effects compared to their individual components, with conjunctival hyperemia and ocular allergy being less frequent in some timolol-containing fixed-combination therapies. This effect appears to be most significant for latanoprost 0.005%, bimatoprost 0.03%, and brimonidine 0.2%.",

    "158": "Muscle metaboreflex-induced increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during submaximal dynamic exercise are mediated principally by increases in cardiac output. To what extent, if any, the peripheral vasculature contributes to this rise in MAP is debatable. In several studies, we observed that in response to muscle metaboreflex activation (MMA; induced by partial hindlimb ischemia) a small but significant increase in vascular conductance occurred within the nonischemic areas (calculated as cardiac output minus hindlimb blood flow and termed nonischemic vascular conductance; NIVC). We hypothesized that these increases in NIVC may stem from a metaboreflex-induced release of epinephrine, resulting in \u03b22-mediated dilation. We measured NIVC and arterial plasma epinephrine levels in chronically instrumented dogs during rest, mild exercise (3.2 km/h), and MMA before and after \u03b2-blockade (propranolol; 2 mg/kg), \u03b11-blockade (prazosin; 50 \u03bcg/kg), and \u03b11 + \u03b2-blockade. Both epinephrine and NIVC increased significantly from exercise to MMA: 81.9 \u00b1 18.6 to 141.3 \u00b1 22.8 pg/ml and 33.8 \u00b1 1.5 to 37.6 \u00b1 1.6 ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7mmHg(-1), respectively.

    "164": "The beta2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) family, which is the largest family of cell surface receptors in humans. Extra attention has been focused on the human GPCRs because they have been studied as important protein targets for pharmaceutical drug development. In fact, approximately 40% of marketed drugs directly work on GPCRs. GPCRs respond to various extracellular stimuli, such as sensory signals, neurotransmitters, chemokines, and hormones, to induce structural changes at the cytoplasmic surface, activating downstream signaling pathways, primarily through interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins or through G-protein independent pathways, such as arrestin. Most GPCRs, except for rhodhopsin, which contains covalently linked 11 cis-retinal, bind to diffusible ligands, having various conformational states between inactive and active structures. The first human GPCR structure was determined using an inverse agonist bound \u03b22AR in 2007 and since then, more than 20 distinct GPCR structures have been solved. However, most GPCR structures were solved as inactive forms, and an agonist bound fully active structure is still hard to obtain. In a structural point of view, \u03b22AR is relatively well studied since its fully active structure as a complex with G protein as well as several inactive structures are available. The structural comparison of inactive and active states gives an important clue in understanding the activation mechanism of \u03b22AR. In this review, structural features of inactive and active states of \u03b22AR, the interaction of \u03b22AR with heterotrimeric G protein, and the comparison with \u03b21AR will be discussed.", 
    "165": "Seven-transmembrane receptors, also called GPCRs, represent the largest class of drug targets. Upon ligand binding, a GPCR undergoes conformational rearrangement and thereby changes its interaction with effector proteins including the cognate G-proteins and the multifunctional adaptor proteins, \u03b2-arrestins. These proteins, by initiating distinct signal transduction mechanisms, mediate one or several functional responses. Recently, the concept of ligand-directed GPCR signalling, also called functional selectivity or biased agonism, has been proposed to explain the phenomenon that chemically diverse ligands exhibit different efficacies towards the different signalling pathways of a single GPCR, and thereby act as functionally selective or 'biased' ligands. Current concepts support the notion that ligand-specific GPCR conformations are the basis of ligand-directed signalling. Multiple studies using fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, mass spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, single-molecule force spectroscopy and other techniques have provided the evidence to support this notion. It is anticipated that these techniques will ultimately help elucidate the structural basis of ligand-directed GPCR signalling at a precision meaningful for structure-based drug design and how a specific ligand molecular structure induces a unique receptor conformation leading to biased signalling. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in experimental techniques applied in the study of functionally selective GPCR conformations and breakthrough data obtained in these studies particularly those of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor.",

    "170": "A major hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), whose formation is regulated by the \u03b3-secretase complex and its activating protein (also known as \u03b3-secretase activating protein, or GSAP). Because GSAP interacts with the \u03b3-secretase without affecting the cleavage of Notch, it is an ideal target for a viable anti-A\u03b2 therapy. GSAP derives from a C-terminal fragment of a larger precursor protein of 98 kDa via a caspase 3-mediated cleavage. However, the mechanism(s) involved in its degradation remain unknown. In this study, we show that GSAP has a short half-life of approximately 5 h. Neuronal cells treated with proteasome inhibitors markedly prevented GSAP protein degradation, which was associated with a significant increment in A\u03b2 levels and \u03b3-secretase cleavage products. In contrast, treatment with calpain blocker and lysosome inhibitors had no effect. In addition, we provide experimental evidence that GSAP is ubiquitinated. Taken together, our findings reveal that GSAP is degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Modulation of the GSAP degradation pathway may be implemented as a viable target for a safer anti-A\u03b2 therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease. The GSAP derives from a precursor via a caspase 3-mediated cleavage, is up-regulated in Alzheimer's disease brains and facilitates A\u03b2 production by interacting directly with the \u03b3-secretase complex. Here, we demonstrate that GSAP is ubiquitinated and then selectively degraded via the proteasome system but not the calpains or lysosome pathways. These findings provide further evidence for the involvement of the proteasome system in the regulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) precursor protein metabolism and A\u03b2 formation.

Automatic supraventricular tachycardias are infrequent but are typical of the pediatric age; treatment should be targeted at rate control in addition to tachycardia interruption. Beta-blockers and calcium antagonists are the most useful drugs for tachycardia control. Ventricular tachycardia is a very uncommon arrhythmia in children usually related to channelopathies; in this setting beta-blockers are often the first-choice treatment, but in many selected patients implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator is required. Other types of ventricular tachycardia include fascicular and infundibular tachycardias that are usually well controlled by medical and/or ablation therapy. Ablation procedures are very effective in curing many tachyarrhythmias also in the pediatric age; the main indication for ablation is the need for continuing medical therapy after the age of 10-12 years.

MH-78 possesses both \u03b11- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocking activity, which was confirmed in the in vivo study. In biofunctional assays, MH-78 displayed vasorelaxant activity due to \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonism and calcium channel blocking properties.

Tablets were evaluated for physicochemical properties such as hardness, thickness and buoyancy. SD prepared with the drug to poloxamer ratio of 1:4 by melt granulation showed a higher dissolution rate than all other dispersions. Formulations containing 40 mg of polyethylene oxide (C-P40) and 50 mg xanthan gum (C-X50) were found to be best, with the drug retardation up to 12 hours. Optimized formulations were characterized using FTIR and DSC and no drug and excipient interactions were detected.",

We attempted to determine the significance of \u03b21-AAb in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients who received carvedilol in a substudy of the Japanese Chronic Heart Failure study.", 
    "179": "In this prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, 117 patients were assigned to 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 20 mg (n\u00a0= 38, 36, and 43) carvedilol groups according to the target dose. \u03b21-AAb was positive in 51 patients (44%, P) and negative in 66 (56%, N). The percentage increase of left ventricular ejection fraction over 56 weeks (\u0394LVEF) was larger in P than in N (P\u00a0= .050) and in the high-titer group (H) than in the low-titer group (L; P\u00a0= .04). Left ventricular (LV) volume decreased to a greater extent in H than in L over 56 weeks. \u03b21-AAb titer was significantly correlated with \u0394LVEF and the percentage change of LV volume and was an independent predictor of them. No difference was seen in the composite end point (all-cause mortality and hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases or heart failure). However, in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, it was more common in the 2.5 mg group than in the other groups in N, and it was similar among the 3 groups in P.",

However, the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-D) on outcomes in continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (CF-LVAD) patients is not known. We sought to determine if CRT-D improved clinical outcomes in CF-LVAD patients compared with ICDs alone.", 
    "182": "Sixty-one consecutive CF-LVAD patients with an ICD or CRT-D were evaluated. Impacts of CRT-D on mortality, all-cause hospitalization, and incidence of atrial (AA) and ventricular (VA) arrhythmias after LVAD implantation was compared with patients with ICD alone. Of the 61 LVAD patients, 31 (age 59.8 \u00b1 16 years, 84% male) had CRT-D and 30 (age 57.2 \u00b1 13 years, 74% male) had ICD. Before LVAD implantation, no significant differences were noted between the groups in demographic and clinical characteristics, LVAD indications, and incidence of AA and VA. Over 682 \u00b1 45 days of LVAD support, 8 patients (25.8%) died in the CRT-D arm versus 5 (16.7%) in the ICD arm (P\u00a0= .35). No differences were noted between the CRT-D and ICD groups in all-cause (96.8 vs 93.3%; P\u00a0= .63) and HF (19.4 vs 26.7%; P\u00a0= .78) hospitalizations, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic diameter (6.4 \u00b1 1.5 vs 6.2 \u00b1 1.1 cm, P\u00a0= .47), and incidence of AA (35.4% vs 33.3%; P\u00a0= .80), VA (29% vs 26.6%; P\u00a0= .86), and ICD shocks (22.6% vs 16.7%; P\u00a0= .93). Beta-blocker and antiarrhythmic drug use after LVAD implantation was similar in both groups.",

    "185": "We sought to assess the quality of pharmacotherapy among new users of antihypertensives in Quebec, and to measure persistence with treatment in the short and longer term.", 
    "186": "Using provincial administrative databases, a historical population-based study was conducted with a cohort of Quebec adults who filled their first antihypertensive prescription between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2009. We described antihypertensive treatment for those with a diagnosis of hypertension (HTN) in the 5 years preceding initiation of drug therapy. Conformity with criteria for optimal use based on the 2006 Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) was evaluated. Persistence with treatment was estimated at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years after pharmacotherapy initiation.", 
    "187": "Among the 79,181 new antihypertensive users with HTN who started treatment between 2007 and 2009, 82.5% were first prescribed only one drug, usually an angiotensin II receptor blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and rarely a diuretic. 24.2% of newly treated hypertensive persons aged 60 or older in our sample received a beta-blocker, which is not recommended practice. The initial treatment conformed to CHEP recommendations for 72.8% of those with uncomplicated HTN. After 3 months, 69.8% of new users still persisted with their treatment. This proportion remained stable after 1 year (69.1%) and 2 years (69.2%).", 
    "188": "Conformity of antihypertensive treatment with CHEP criteria, and patient persistence with therapy, was fairly high for new users in the province of Quebec. Research is needed, however, on how to further improve p\u00c9\u00c9harmacotherapy quality and persistence in new users.", 
    "189": "Fixed-combination ocular hypotensives have multiple advantages, but triple-therapy dorzolamide/brimonidine/timolol (dorz/brim/tim) is only available in Latin and South America, and information on its relative efficacy is limited. This study compares the efficacy and tolerability of fixed-combination bimatoprost/timolol (bim/tim) and dorz/brim/tim in Mexican patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.", 
    "190": "In this investigator-masked, crossover study, patients with unmet target intraocular pressure (IOP) on once-daily bim/tim or twice-daily dorz/brim/tim received the opposite medication for 3\u00a0months before returning to their pre-baseline medication for 3\u00a0months. IOP was evaluated before and after morning instillation at months 2, 3, 5 and 6. Primary endpoints were mean IOP change and Ocular Surface Disease Index\u00a9 (OSDI) score at each visit. The intent-to-treat population was the a priori analysis population, but due to the number of discontinuations, the per-protocol and intent-to-treat populations were used for the primary efficacy and sensitivity analyses, respectively.", 
    "191": "Seventy-eight and 56 patients were included in the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations, respectively. At month 3, statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline were observed in the bim/tim (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and dorz/brim/tim (P\u2009<\u20090.0001) groups, regardless of assessment time. At month 6, patients returned to bim/tim exhibited no significant IOP increase (regardless of assessment time), but patients returned to dorz/brim/tim exhibited a statistically significant IOP increase (P\u2009<\u20090.001) when assessed before instillation of study treatment. Results were similar in both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis populations. In the per-protocol analysis, 70% of patients on bim/tim at month 3 had an IOP <14\u00a0mm Hg, which declined to 58% (P\u2009=\u20090.0061) at month 6 (ie, after 3\u00a0months of dorz/brim/tim treatment). In patients receiving dorz/brim/tim at month 3, 38% had an IOP <14\u00a0mm Hg, which remained comparable after return to bim/tim. OSDI scores and incidence of adverse events were similar in both groups.", 
    "192": "In this first direct comparison of the efficacy of dorz/brim/tim and bim/tim, patients switched from dorz/brim/tim to bim/tim demonstrated improved/lower IOP; when returned to dorz/brim/tim, IOP increased to levels seen at study initiation, suggesting that once-daily bim/tim may have greater IOP-lowering efficacy. Both bim/tim and dorz/brim/tim were well tolerated with minimal ocular surface damage.",

    "194": "The clinical efficacy and safety profile of propranolol 1% cream in treatment of superficial infantile hemangiomas (IHs) were determined in a preliminary randomized group of eight infants. Five boys and three girls, 3 to 12 months old, with an IHs superficial capillary type on the forehead, posterior side of the neck, forearm, abdomen, or posterior side of the trunk were examined at our outpatient clinic between 2011 and 2014. Topical propranolol was applied twice daily for 10 months with clinical evaluation and photographic documentation performed every 1 to 2 months. Size, texture, and color changes were monitored. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated using the Archauer system: Grade I (bad) reduction in size < 25%, Grade II (medium) reduction between 26% and 50%, Grade III (good) reduction between 51% and 75%, and Grade IV (excellent) reduction > 75%. The majority of hemangiomas treated, 62.5%, achieved Grade IV. A Grade III outcome was noticed in one patient with an IH (12.5%) and Grade II in 25% of patients with IHs on the abdomen. The treatment was well tolerated without side effects, which indicates that topical application of 1% propranolol is a safe, effective, and cheap therapeutic option for treating superficial IHs.", 
    "195": "It is known that cadmium (Cd) induces cytotoxicity via Ca(2+) signaling, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we studied the molecular mechanisms of Cd-induced cytotoxicity in BRL 3A cells, a rat liver cell line. We observed that Cd treatment was associated with a time-dependent decrease in cell index (CI) in BRL 3A cells. Mechanistically, we observed that Cd exposure was associated with decreased expression of Cx43, P-Cx43, and Cx32. Specifically, Cx43 was decreased at the site of cell-cell junctions at the cell membrane, corresponding to a decrease in gap junctional intercellular connections (GJICs). We also found that Cd triggered a rise in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), and the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis, acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), prevented the Cd-induced decrease in CI. On the other hand, the gap junction blocker 18-\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin exacerbated cytotoxic injury induced by Cd via further elevating [Ca(2+)]i, The extracellular calcium chelator ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid could partly attenuate Cd-induced calcium elevation but had little effect on GA combined Cd. Furthermore, salidroside as a protective agent prevented Cd-induced GJIC inhibition and calcium overload. Our findings suggest that Cd triggers elevation of [Ca(2+)]i via mainly stimulating Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) storage organelles and inhibiting GJIC, causing cytotoxic injury, and salidroside could be used to prevent Cd-induced cytotoxicity."
