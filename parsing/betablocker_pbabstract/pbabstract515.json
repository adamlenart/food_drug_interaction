The AAG serum concentration was increased to 180.7% in patients with lung cancer and decreased to 73.4% in cirrhotic patients as compared with controls (P less than 0.05). 3. The concanavalin A (conA) dependent heterogeneity of serum AAG was very similar in controls and patients with lung cancer: a ratio of 9/9/2 was obtained for the conA nonreactive, the conA weakly reactive and the conA strongly reactive subfraction respectively; in cirrhotic patients, the ratio shifted to 11/7/1. 4. The heterogeneity in electric charge, demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, was similar in the three groups of subjects: 70-80% of the focussed bands were found in the main three bands. 5. The binding of oxprenolol to serum proteins was increased in lung tumour patients and decreased in liver cirrhotic patients as compared with controls (P less than 0.05). There was no change in binding affinity and oxprenolol binding was significantly correlated to total AAG serum concentration and to the concentration of each of the conA dependent subtypes, in controls as well as in both patients groups.", 
    "1": "The efficacy of MCI-154, a new pyridazinone cardiotonic agent, in improving heart failure was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations in which cardiac function had been severely depressed by pentobarbital. MCI-154 in doses of 10-100 micrograms improved the cardiac function curve and restored it to the control level at 100 micrograms. At this dose, MCI-154 neither produced an increase in heart rate beyond the control value nor induced arrhythmias. The effects of MCI-154 were not affected by atenolol, a cardioselective beta 1-blocker. These results indicate that MCI-154 would be of potential use in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "2": "To investigate the pattern of innervation and the contractile properties of human iris sphincter muscle, we have observed the effects of field stimulation, various drugs and excess-K+ solutions on isometric tension development in strips of the iris sphincter from five humans. Spontaneous mechanical responses were not observed in these tissues. Electrical field stimulation (50 V, 0.8 msec, 20 Hz) evoked a contraction which was abolished by 10(-7) M tetrodotoxin (TTX) or by 10(-6) M atropine, thereby indicating that the response was cholinergically mediated. In the presence of atropine, electrical field stimulation did not affect muscle tone, even when this was elevated by histamine. The effect of exogenously applied noradrenaline (NA) varied among the specimens, i.e. in three out of four cases a contraction was evoked while a relaxation occurred in one preparation. The contraction evoked by NA was blocked by phentolamine (10(-6) M) and the relaxation was blocked by timolol (10(-6) M). Excess-K+ solutions, dose dependently contracted the muscle strips and application of 10(-6) M atropine decreased the amplitude of these contractions. The results indicate that the human iris sphincter is innervated by excitatory cholinergic nerve fibres and that the adrenergic innervation is sparse. In addition, this muscle possesses both alpha and beta adrenoceptors. Activation of alpha receptors produces a contraction whilst activation of the beta adrenoceptors causes relaxation.", 
    "3": "A patient with essential hypertension receiving the oral administration of acebutolol, a beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker, showed a marked increase in urinary 17-ketosteroid (17-KS) excretion determined by Zimmermann's method. Since the normal concentration of each fraction of 17-KS was found in this case by gas chromatography, the possibility of an abnormality in steroid metabolism could be excluded from the mechanism of the increase in the measured value for urinary 17-KS. In the urine samples from patients treated with acebutolol, acebutolol and acetylated acebutolol, a main metabolite of acebutolol, were found equally among them. Moreover, acebutolol or acetylated acebutolol resulted in a dose-dependent increase in 17-KS by Zimmermann's method in phosphate buffered saline or in a urine sample. However, the other beta-blockers, such as propranolol, alprenolol and oxprenolol did not show any effect on the determined value for urinary 17-KS. Thus it was concluded that the activated methylene group of acebutolol and acetylated acebutolol may interfere with the measured values obtained by Zimmermann's method.", 
    "4": "The effects of iontophoretic application of noradrenaline on spontaneous or glutamate-evoked activity were studied in Purkinje neurons in explant cultures. The most frequently observed effect of noradrenaline was a depression of glutamate responses, and this was sometimes observed in the absence of apparent changes in spontaneous activity. In 30 out of 80 cells, glutamate responses were increased during or following noradrenaline application. In 21 of the 30 cells, these potentiations were of relatively short duration (less than 4 min), while in the other 9, the potentiations had a much longer duration. beta-Adrenergic antagonists blocked the long duration potentiations in four out of five cells, while short duration potentiation was blocked in only one of eight cells. The alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin blocked the short duration potentiations in six of eight cells. The results indicate that long duration potentiations by noradrenaline as reported in the hippocampus are also observable in the cerebellum, and that short and long duration potentials of glutamate responses may be pharmacologically distinct.", 
    "5": "This study was designed to assess the contribution of thromboxane A2 to high blood pressure in rats with angiotensin II (Ang II)-salt hypertension. Hypertension was induced in rats drinking 0.15 M NaCl by infusion of Ang II (125 ng/min i.p.) for 12 days. Relative to values in water-drinking rats without Ang II infusion, Ang II-salt hypertensive rats exhibited augmentation (p less than 0.05) of blood pressure (from 129 +/- 3 to 217 +/- 12 mm Hg), urinary thromboxane B2 excretion (from 5.4 +/- 0.9 to 25.4 +/- 2.1 ng/day), and thromboxane B2 release from renal cortex slices (from 71.3 +/- 6.7 to 121.1 +/- 14.4 pg/mg) and aortic rings (from 28.8 +/- 2.9 to 115.8 +/- 12.8 pg/mg). Treatment with an inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthetase, UK 38485, had no effect on blood pressure in normotensive and Ang II-salt hypertensive rats. Treatment with a thromboxane A2 receptor blocker, SQ 29548, decreased blood pressure in Ang II-salt hypertensive rats from 191 +/- 9 to 152 +/- 9 mm Hg after 3 hours, but it had no effect on blood pressure in normotensive rats. Since SQ 29548 interfered with the pressor effects of the prostaglandin endoperoxide analogue U-46619, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and 9 alpha,11 beta-prostaglandin F2, we suggest that the SQ 29548-induced blood pressure reduction in Ang II-salt hypertensive rats is the manifestation of blockade of the vascular actions of one or more endogenous prostanoids including thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin endoperoxides. If so, pressor prostanoids may be contributory factors in the pathogenesis of severe Ang II-salt hypertension in rats.", 
    "6": "The aim of this prospective, monocentric, opened study and with random order for antihypertensive sequence was to compare a betablocker with sympathomimetic activity (ACE) and an alphabetablocker (LAB) to the gold standard treatment (MD) in moderate HDP (BP greater than 90 mmHg). This study (January 1984 to December 1985) includes 63 women, mean age 28.2 years, divided into three comparable subgroups (age, parity, risk factors and initial level of SBP/DBP). Initial doses are 500 mg/bid (MD), and 400 mg/bid (ACE, LAB) and optimal dosages could not be respectively more than 1500 mg/bid (MD) or 1200 mg/bid (ACE, LAB). Usual criteria for maternal and foetal care are taken into account. The chi 2 test, the Student \"t\" test and the Kruskall Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. The results show: 1--A similar antihypertensive effect for MD and LAB, but significantly less for ACE (initial PAD-37th week PAD: MD +/- 18.8 +/- 2; LAB = -17.9 +/- 3; ACE = - 8.2 +/- 2.7 mmHg, p less than 0.02; 2--A more frequent adjustment of daily dosage with MD (n = 15) than with ACE (n = 10) or LAB (n = 7); 3--The absence of any significant difference for uricemia level, platelet counts, foetal cardiac rythm, and occurrence of pre-eclampsia (MD = 4; ACE = 3; LAB = 4; 4--An equivalent birth-weight (MD = 3110 +/- 628 g; ACE = 3115 +/- 645.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "The effect of brown adipose tissue (BAT) denervation on the prepontine knife cut-induced hyperthermia was studied. The knife cut has earlier been shown to induce a steady state hyperthermia of 3 to 4 degrees C, as a result of marked activation of the BAT. Before the lesion, the interscapular BAT (IBAT) temperature was lower than the colonic temperature, but the temperature gradient reversed a few minutes after the lesion and the fractional blood flow increased 12-fold. Bilateral sectioning of the 5 nerves supplying IBAT did not modify either the magnitude or the kinetics of the IBAT hyperthermic response. The IBAT fractional blood flow, which was 15 times higher in denervated than in intact tissue before the lesion, scarcely increased following the lesion despite the sharp increase in the tissue's metabolic activity. Chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine suppressed the hyperthermic response. Propranolol or hexamethonium injected i.v. during the steady state hyperthermia resulted in a rapid drop in IBAT temperature and in a reversal of the gradient between IBAT and colonic temperature both in denervated and in intact IBAT. Injection of desipramine, an inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake, resulted in itself in an increase of temperature in both intact and denervated tissue, which is circumstantial evidence for the presence of a functional residual innervation in the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "In a double-masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial, the authors evaluated the ocular hypotensive efficacy of twice-daily treatment with levobunolol (0.25 and 0.5%) and betaxolol (0.5%) in 85 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. During the 3-month study, intraocular pressure (IOP) reductions in the two levobunolol groups were significantly greater than in the betaxolol group. From a mean baseline IOP of approximately 25 mmHg, overall mean reductions were 6.2 and 6.0 mmHg for the 0.25 and 0.5% levobunolol groups, respectively, and 3.7 mmHg for the betaxolol group. No clinically or statistically significant among-group differences were noted in the systemic safety variables evaluated. These data suggest that although all three treatments are effective, levobunolol provides a greater reduction in IOP than betaxolol.", 
    "9": "The prophylactic effect of topical 0.5% levobunolol on intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations after neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser posterior capsulotomies and extracapsular cataract extractions (ECCEs) was investigated in two separate, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies. In study 1, 42 patients received either levobunolol or vehicle 1 hour before a unilateral Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy. Elevated IOP (greater than or equal to 10 mmHg) occurred in up to 38% of those in the vehicle group and none in the levobunolol group. Mean IOP increased up to 6 mmHg in the vehicle group, whereas it decreased up to 3 mmHg in the levobunolol group. In study 2, 41 patients received either levobunolol or vehicle immediately after a unilateral ECCE involving the use of a viscoelastic preparation and the implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL). The incidence of IOP elevations (greater than or equal to 10 mmHg) was up to 40% in the vehicle group and 19% in the levobunolol group. Mean IOP increased up to 9 mmHg in the vehicle group and up to 2 mmHg in the levobunolol group. Thus, marked elevations in IOP after posterior capsulotomies or ECCEs may be minimized by prophylactic treatment with levobunolol.", 
    "10": "This study was carried on two groups each of 10 patients undergoing major maxillofacial or orthopedic operations. Hypotensive anesthesia was conducted using SNP and labetalol. Labetalol produced hypotension without tachycardia which was evident in the SNP group. Blood sugar increased significantly in both groups. Serum insulin level decreased significantly in the SNP group, while in the labetalol group it showed an insignificant increase.", 
    "11": "The relation between airway responsiveness to propranolol and histamine was studied in 32 asthmatic children. Propranolol and histamine were given by nebuliser to a maximum dose of 16 mg/ml and 32 mg/ml respectively and the response was measured as the provocative concentration of agonist causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20). A PC20 histamine value of less than 32 mg/ml was obtained in 24 of the 32 children, of whom 15 had a measurable PC20 propranolol (less than 16 mg/ml). In these 24 children the geometric mean PC20 histamine was 4.5 mg/ml and 14.4 mg/ml respectively in those with and without a measurable PC20 propranolol (p = 0.023). There was a linear relationship between histamine and propranolol PC20 values (r = 0.60), and between PC20 histamine and FEV1 % predicted (r = 0.43), but not between PC20 propranolol and FEV1 % predicted (r = 0.38). In an open time course study in 12 children with asthma recovery of FEV1 after inhaled propranolol was incomplete in seven of the children after 90 minutes. When inhaled propranolol was followed by inhaled ipratropium bromide in a further 11 children FEV1 had returned to baseline in all children after 60 minutes. Thus propranolol inhalation can be used in children with asthma to assess the contribution of the beta adrenergic system to the regulation of bronchial smooth muscle tone. The test has several disadvantages in comparison with histamine provocation-long duration, the prolonged action of propranolol, and the fact that only the children with substantial hyperreactivity to histamine react to propranolol.", 
    "12": "Planula larvae of Halocordyle disticha were examined for the presence of catecholamines using a multipronged approach. Transmission electron micrographs of planular sensory cells and ganglionic cells demonstrated dense-cored vesicles and electron-dense droplets in both cell types. These vesicles and droplets were similar in morphology to catecholamine-containing granules of vertebrates. Planulae processed with the SPG histofluorescence technique, specific only for catecholamines, exhibited blue-green fluorophores which were most prominent in the anterior ectoderm. Such fluorescence was associated with sensory cells, ganglionic cells and the neural plexus. Pretreatment of planulae with neuropharmacological agents which prevent reuptake (reserpine) or cause release (nicotine, ephedrine) of catecholamines caused a diminution of the fluorophores. Pretreatment of animals with 6-hydroxydopamine, which causes destruction of catecholamine-containing cells, prevented any fluorescent response. Ultrastructural examination of reserpine-treated planulae revealed a dramatic reduction in the populations of dense-cored vesicles and electron-dense droplets. Furthermore, many of the vesicles and droplets remaining in reserpinized animals appeared washed out, i.e. stained faintly. Exposure of planulae to exogenous norepinephrine caused premature, rapid metamorphosis and produced polyps with slightly stunted tentacles and pitted, irregular hypostomes. Exposure of planulae to nicotine caused similar effects. Rearing planulae in sea water containing alpha blockers, phentolamine and tolazoline, had no discernible effect on behaviour (motility, phototactic response) or gross morphology. However, planulae raised in sea water containing propranolol, a beta blocker, ceased all movement, became tack-shaped and died within 72 h. These results meet multiple criteria for the identification of catecholamines in hydrozoan planulae and suggest that such catecholamines may function as neurotransmitters, neurohormones or neuromodulators during larval development.", 
    "13": "Isamoltane (CGP 361A; (1-(2-(1-pyrrolyl)-phenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propanol hydrochloride), a beta-adrenoceptor ligand (IC50 = 8.4 nmol/l) which has reported activity as an anxiolytic in man was found to be a reasonably active inhibitor of the binding of [125I]ICYP to 5-HT1B recognition sites in rat brain membranes with 27-fold selectivity (IC50 = 39 nmol/l) as compared to the inhibition of binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors (IC50 = 1070 nmol/l). This selectivity was considerably greater than that observed for other beta-adrenoceptor ligands including propranolol (5-HT1A/5-HT1B ratio = 2), oxpenolol (3.5) and cyanopindolol (8.7). The 5-HT1B activity of the compound resided in the (-)-enantiomer. (-)-Isamoltane had weak activity (IC50 3-10 mumol/l) at 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The compound was devoid of activity at a number of other central neurotransmitter recognition sites including the 5-HT1C site. Isamoltane increased the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT from prelabeled rat cortical slices in a manner similar to that of cyanopindolol. While both compounds were similar in potency to methiothepin, they had lower efficacy. Oxprenolol was less potent that both isamoltane and cyanopindolol while propranolol was essentially inactive. The effects of the compounds on 5-HT release appeared to be correlated with their 5-HT1B rather than 5-HT1A activity. In vivo, isamoltane increased 5-HTP accumulation in rat cortex following central decarboxylase inhibition at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg i.p. At higher doses this effect was gradually diminished. Similar, but less clearcut results were obtained with cyanopindolol and oxprenolol, but propranolol was ineffective. No changes in brain tryptophan levels were associated with the isamoltane-evoked changes in brain 5-HTP levels. In reserpinized animals, isamoltane reduced 5-HTP accumulation even at doses which enhanced accumulation of this metabolite when given alone. The effects of the putative 5-HT1B agonist, m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), the mixed 5-HT autoreceptor agonist/antagonist/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol, the 5-HT uptake inhibitor, CGP 6085A and the MAO-A inhibitor, brofaromine, were not antagonized by pretreatment with isamoltane. The possibility that isamoltane and the other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are antagonists at 5-HT1B receptors and that their effect on 5-HT synthesis in vivo is the net result of their agonist/antagonist effects at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors is discussed in relation to the potential mechanism of the anxiolytic activity of isamoltane.", 
    "14": "1. The pharmacology of various agonists and antagonists was studied in the human isolated cystic artery. 2. The estimated pA2s for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin against the alpha-adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and noradrenaline were not significantly different. Similar results were seen for estimated pA2s of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine against these same agonists. Equivalent responses to exogenous noradrenaline and to transmural electrical stimulation were blocked to the same degree by an antagonist with alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties (prazosin). Responses to transmural electrical stimulation, however, tended to be more resistant than equivalent responses to exogenous noradrenaline to blockade by antagonists with alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking properties (phentolamine, yohimbine). 3. Relaxation to isoprenaline was observed in partially contracted arterial strips using isoprenaline concentrations of up to 10(-6) M, but cumulative addition of higher concentrations of isoprenaline sometimes then evoked a contraction from the relaxation nadir. The relaxation effect of isoprenaline was antagonized by propranolol (10(-5) M). 4. These findings suggest the human cystic artery has almost exclusively alpha 1-adrenoceptors postjunctionally, although prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors may be present; and, it also has some postjunctional beta-adrenoceptors which mediate relaxation.", 
    "15": "In mild hypertension, a betablocker treatment could reduce cardiovascular events. But in smoking men the benefit disappears and this interaction is unexplained. In 6 healthy non smoking men, we studied the effects of acute oral administration of propranolol (80 mg) pindolol (15 mg) and placebo after cigarette smoking (CS) (two cigarettes within 10 minutes). In a double blind cross over randomized study, arterial pressure and heart rate (HR) were recorded within 20 minutes after CS. Brachial artery diameter (D), Local vascular Resistance (RL), Local arterial Compliance (CL) and pulse wave velocity (VOP) were determined non invasively (using a pulsed doppler system) before and 20 mn after CS. Under placebo, mean arterial pressure (PAM), HR and RL increased significantly after CS (+9.2 +/- 3 mmHg, +4.5 +/- 3 b/mn and +36 +/- 14 per cent, respectively). These modifications were not different after propranolol, pindolol or placebo (ANOVA). Arterial distensibility (CL) was decreased after CS and this alteration was not prevented by beta-blockers. Brachial artery diameter was not modified after CS. Our results demonstrate that acute treatment with non selective beta-blockers with or without sympathomimetic intrinsic activity does not prevent haemodynamic modifications induced by cigarette smoking.", 
    "16": "Lung isolated from 7-week-old rats was perfused with pH 7.4 Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution (35 mL) containing 1 to 100 micrograms mL-1 of propranolol and 3% BSA at the recirculation rate of 8 mL min-1. Almost parallel bi-exponential drug concentration-time curves were obtained at the initial load lower than 10 micrograms mL-1, whereas relatively slow, mono-exponential decline was found after perfusion at 100 micrograms mL-1. Pharmacokinetic analysis for the perfusate propranolol concentration-time curves when loaded at 1 to 10 micrograms mL-1 yielded almost comparable values for the pulmonary perfusion clearance (0.387 +/- 0.092 to 0.486 +/- 0.095 mL min-1 g-1). In contrast, this parameter was significantly reduced at 100 micrograms mL-1 (0.113 +/- 0.042 mL min-1 g-1). The present findings suggest a trend towards saturation kinetics in the in-vitro pulmonary clearance of propranolol.", 
    "17": "The selectivity of the beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by single oral doses of cetamolol, atenolol, and nadolol was compared in normal male subjects. Study 1 established the dose at which each drug provides equivalent beta-1 blockade. Beta-1 blockade was estimated using the degree of inhibition of the increased heart rate (HR) response to graded exercise. Cetamolol (30 mg), atenolol (100 mg), and nadolol (80 mg) all attenuated the HR response to a comparable extent. This result established that the dose ratio of cetamolol:atenolol:nadolol of 1.00:3.33:2.67 provides equipotent beta-1 blockade. This ratio of doses was used in Studies 2 and 3 to evaluate the antagonism of beta-2-mediated responses to titrated doses of intravenous isoproterenol (ISO) by low and high doses of each drug. Beta-2 blockade was assessed using the attenuation of ISO-induced reductions in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in Study 2 and ISO-induced increases in specific airway conductance (sGAW) in Study 3. For within drug comparisons, antagonism of the HR increase induced by ISO (a response mediated by both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors) was also examined. Treatments included cetamolol (15 and 60 mg), atenolol (50 and 200 mg), and nadolol (40 and 160 mg in Study 2; 40 mg only in Study 3). All drugs tested suppressed the HR, DBP, and sGAW responses to ISO, and this blockade was dose dependent. Cetamolol and nadolol produced approximately equipotent beta-1 blockade, whereas cetamolol at both doses produced a less potent beta-2 blockade. Atenolol antagonized ISO effects on all parameters less than either cetamolol or nadolol. Quantitative cardioselectivity indices revealed that cetamolol 60 mg was the most cardioselective and nadolol 40 mg the least. Data from the three studies demonstrate that cetamolol is cardioselective relative to nadolol and that, in contrast to atenolol, cardioselectivity appears to increase at the higher dose.", 
    "18": "Among the antihypertensives currently in use, the sympatholytic drugs (e.g., central alpha-agonists, beta-blockers) and diuretics are most commonly associated with sexual side effects. Previous reports of sexual dysfunction associated with these drugs have been based entirely on retrospective and self-report data. This is the first study to date to investigate beta-blocker effects on sexual function by means of physiological (NPT), subjective, and hormonal measures. Four beta-blockers with different ancillary properties (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, propranolol) were evaluated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, Latin-square design. Thirty healthy male volunteers received, in counterbalanced order, each of the four drugs and 1 week of placebo testing. Significant drug effects on both total and free testosterone were found during treatment with all four beta-blockers, although it appeared that the nonselective drugs (pindolol, propranolol) were associated with the greatest reduction in testosterone. No significant effects were found on measures of cortisol or cholesterol. Analysis of NPT and self-report data yielded inconclusive results, perhaps due to the confounding effects of sleep disruption and the brief duration of treatment in this study. Inspection of individual records, however, suggested that some subjects may be especially vulnerable to sexual dysfunction in association with propranolol.", 
    "19": "It is unclear whether beta-adrenergic agonists or antagonists affect lung liquid and protein exchange by changing pulmonary hemodynamics or microvascular leakiness. In 23 unanesthetized, instrumented sheep with long-term lung lymph fistulas, we assessed the effect of the beta-agonist terbutaline or the beta-antagonists propranolol, nadolol, and atenolol, all infused intravenously, on lung lymph flow under base-line conditions and during the acute lung injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolism. Under base-line conditions, neither beta-stimulation nor blockade had any effect. During air embolism, terbutaline decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and lymph flow by 25%. Propranolol and nadolol (non-selective beta 1,beta 2-antagonists) but not atenolol (selective beta 1-antagonist) also decreased lymph flow by 22% on average. We favor the more conservative (hemodynamic) over the more liberal (altered permeability) explanation for our results. First, beta-stimulation clearly caused vasodilation, which lowered the pulmonary microvascular pressure at the site of injury. beta-blockade caused changes similar to alpha-stimulation (J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 2147-2153, 1987). We therefore interpret the beta-blockade as unmasking pulmonary arterial alpha-receptors stimulated by the air-embolism injury, thus allowing vasoconstriction upstream to the site of injury. We do not believe the explanation of the beta-agent effects requires any modulation of lung microvascular leakiness by beta-adrenergic agents.", 
    "20": "The effects of regional alpha- and specific beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade on measurements of late diastolic coronary resistance (LDCR) and mean coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV) during exercise were examined in 14 conscious adult mongrel dogs. Specific beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade (ICI 118.551) significantly decreased CBFV and increased LDCR by blockade of beta 2-vasodilator tone independent of alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated tone and independent of altering myocardial metabolism. alpha-Adrenergic receptor blockade (phentolamine, 1 mg) significantly increased CBFV and decreased LDCR by blocking sympathetically mediated vasoconstrictor tone. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of response between alpha- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor blockade. These results demonstrate that alpha- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors have a significant and evidently equal influence on CBFV and LDCR during exercise. Four weeks of daily exercise and left stellate ganglionectomy (LSGx) prevented phentolamine-induced vasodilation but not ICI 118.551-induced vasoconstriction. This suggests that daily exercise and LSGx significantly decreased the alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor tone on the coronary circulation, resulting in an apparently greater role for the coronary vascular beta 2-adrenergic receptor on the control of CBFV and LDCR during exercise.", 
    "21": "Beta-receptor blocking agents are commonly used to treat patients with heart disease, and generalized seizures due to therapy with these agents are rare. All reported cases of seizures due to beta blocking agents have occurred only in those subjects who ingested large doses of the drugs. We observed generalized convulsions in a patient who was receiving therapeutic doses of an ultrashort-acting beta-blocking agent (esmolol hydrochloride) intravenously. A literature survey and possible mechanisms by which these agents induce seizures are presented.", 
    "22": "Celiprolol (400 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) were given once a day to 16 patients with stable angina pectoris in a double blind placebo controlled crossover study. Celiprolol produced less suppression of heart rate both at rest and during exercise than atenolol. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing the frequency of angina and in delaying the onset of ischaemia during exercise. Radionuclide ventriculography showed that atenolol but not celiprolol lowered cardiac output at rest and during exercise. Thus the ancillary properties of celiprolol, including partial beta 2 agonist activity and direct vasodilating activity, have detectable effects on cardiac function that may be beneficial in patients with angina.", 
    "23": "These experiments were designed to assess the interaction of bradykinin and its antagonist (Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Phe-Ser-DPhe-Phe-Arg-trifluoroacetic acid) with the sympathoadrenal system. Three groups of male Wistar rats received 5-minute intra-arterial infusions of either dextrose (Group 1, n = 6), bradykinin, 250 micrograms/min (Group 2, n = 5), or bradykinin, 25 micrograms/min (Group 3, n = 4). Six other groups received a similar infusion of the bradykinin antagonist at 250 micrograms/min. They were either intact rats (Group 4, n = 10) or rats previously submitted to chemical sympathectomy (Group 5, n = 17), to adrenal enucleation (Group 6, n = 8), to combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic blockade (Group 7, n = 7), to alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockade (Group 8, n = 8), or to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blockade (Group 9, n = 8). Bradykinin infusion produced a sustained fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) in Groups 2 and 3 (by -48 +/- 3 and -36 +/- 7 mm Hg, respectively) associated with similar increases in plasma epinephrine levels (100-fold), and norepinephrine (sevenfold) as compared with Group 1. The bradykinin antagonist infusion in intact rats produced a 23 +/- 4 mm Hg rise in MAP associated with a sixfold increase in epinephrine and a twofold increase in norepinephrine. Group 5 rats with lower baseline catecholamine levels had an even larger MAP rise (30 +/- 6 mm Hg) accompanied by a rise in epinephrine and norepinephrine proportionally similar to that of intact animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The effects of cordanum and propranolol on the coronary resistance were studied in isolated cat hearts. The infusion of cordanum and propranolol may be followed by both reduction or enlargement of the coronary resistance. The alterations of the coronary resistance are in most cases parallel with the weakening of the isolated heart function. In some cases cordanum infusion is followed by a short-term reduction in the coronary resistance, which precedes the alteration of the heart function and thus may be due to direct cordanum effect on the coronary vessels.", 
    "25": "To study possible modifications of norepinephrine and epinephrine kinetics (metabolic clearance rate and half-times) by inhibition of binding to alpha- and/or beta-adrenergic receptors, norepinephrine and epinephrine were iv infused in the absence or presence of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent phentolamine, the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol, and during the combined administration of phentolamine and propranolol. In addition, recovery experiments were performed to investigate the in vitro degradation of dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Blood levels and kinetics of epinephrine were not modified by alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, whereas norepinephrine clearance was reduced by alpha-adrenergic blockade, and was greater than epinephrine clearance. alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade markedly modified insulin, glucose and non-esterified fatty acid responses to epinephrine and norepinephrine. Norepinephrine and epinephrine could fully be recovered when added to bovine blood plasma. In contrast, dopamine obviously was immediately destructed by bovine, but not by human blood plasma, and should therefore barely be detectable in blood of cattle in vivo.", 
    "26": "Beta adrenoceptors of the canine large coronary artery were characterized by observing the effects of the subtype selective antagonists, metoprolol (beta-1) and ICI 118,551 (beta-2), on the vasodilator responses of isolated and perfused preparations to beta adrenoceptor agonists and in the radioligand binding assay. The integrity of the endothelium was checked by acetylcholine-induced vasodilations. Without any precontraction, isoproterenol, norepinephrine, epinephrine and procaterol (selective beta-2 agonist) dilated the canine large coronary artery pretreated with phentolamine (10(-5) M). The rank order of agonist potency was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine greater than procaterol. The pA2 values for metoprolol and ICI 118,551 were determined by the antagonisms of the vasodilator responses to isoproterenol and procaterol. The slopes of Schild plots for metoprolol and ICI 118,551 against isoproterenol and the value for ICI 118,551 against procaterol were not significantly different from unity, but the value for metoprolol against procaterol was significantly less than unity. The pA2 value for metoprolol against isoproterenol was 7.48 and those values for ICI 118,551 against isoproterenol and procaterol was 7.19 and 7.25, respectively. These pA2 values are typical for beta-1 adrenoceptors. The beta adrenoceptors of the canine large coronary artery were examined further using an antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol as a ligand for the binding of beta adrenoceptors. The [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding to the canine coronary artery smooth muscle membrane was saturable with a KD of 63.7 pM and a total number of radioligand binding sites of 44 fmol/mg of protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "We studied the effects of adrenergic agonists on the capacity of blood trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi to associate with (i.e., bind and/or penetrate) host cells in vitro. The extent of T. cruzi association with mouse macrophages in the presence of the beta-adrenergic agonist L-isoproterenol was significantly decreased with respect to mock-treated controls. Similar results were obtained when the parasite was pretreated with L-isoproterenol and was then allowed to interact with untreated macrophages. In contrast, pretreatment of trypomastigotes with either L-phenylephrine or methoxamine-alpha-adrenergic agonists--enhanced their reactivity with macrophages. Interaction with a nonphagocytic host cell was also decreased and increased by parasite pretreatment with beta- and alpha-adrenergic agonists, respectively. The L-isoproterenol and L-phenylephrine effects were no longer detectable 2 and 3 hr after their removal, respectively, and were therefore reversible. Atenolol, a specific beta 1 adrenoreceptor blocker inhibited the L-isoproterenol effect, whereas butoxamine, a specific beta 2 blocker, did not. Thus, beta 1-like but not beta 2-like binding sites appeared to be expressed on T. cruzi. Both prazosin and yohimbine, preferential alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptor blockers, respectively, abolished the L-phenylephrine effect. The opposite effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists suggested that the infectivity of T. cruzi may be regulated by activation of surface components comparable to the adreno-receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Although beta-adrenoceptor antagonists such as propranolol have been used in neuropsychiatry for more than 20 years, their indications, extent of efficacy, and place in therapy remain unclear. In this overview, which concentrates on the recent literature, four indications for use of the drugs are reviewed, with particular reference to efficacy, mode of action, and clinical utility. The indications are anxiety disorders, including performance anxiety; schizophrenia; aggressive behavior; and akathisia. The author concludes that beta-blockers are useful in some forms of anxiety disorder, perhaps those characterized by somatic symptoms and by performance anxiety, and that akathisia seems to be responsive to those drugs. However, the use of high doses of beta-blockers in schizophrenia remains unestablished, and insufficient data are available with respect to their use in aggressive behavior.", 
    "29": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for arteriosclerotic vascular disease. Despite intensive antihypertensive intervention, the risk of cardiovascular disease has not declined appreciably. Many of the antihypertensive agents have been shown to elevate total serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels or lower the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level. Thus, the antihypertensive agents chosen may negate the beneficial effects of a lower blood pressure. Our purpose is to review all available antihypertensive medications and their influence on lipoprotein metabolism. Choosing the antihypertensive therapy least likely to worsen or precipitate other known cardiovascular risk factors is important. Cost and side effect profiles must also be considered in choosing the best antihypertensive regimen for your patients.", 
    "30": "In a subacute experiment the authors studied the effects of a fourteen -day treatment with nebivolol, 5 mg once a day, in 10 healthy male volunteers with a mean age of thirty-one, twenty-five to thirty-nine years, by comparing the results of the resting ratio of the preejection period (PEP) to the left ventricular ejection time (LVET), as measured by systolic time intervals (STI), with the results obtained by equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography (ERNA), using technetium 99m-labeled autologous red blood cells as a marker. A submaximal treadmill exercise test performed before and during treatment demonstrated that nebivolol significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure from a mean value of 158 +/- 5.4 bpm to 131 +/- 4.3 bpm and from 171 +/- 4.9 mmHg to 144 +/- 4.5 mmHg respectively. The data from the STI and ERNA were calculated and analyzed independently by two observers. A highly significant (r = 0.8182, p = 0.0038) correlation was found between the changes of stroke volume (SV) and PEPc/LVETc during treatment with nebivolol. Furthermore end-diastolic volume significantly(p = 0.03) increased from a mean value of 177 +/- 10.1 ml to 198 +/- 6 ml and stroke volume significantly (p = 0.01) increased from 120 +/- 6.8 ml to 136 +/- 6.3 ml. Systemic vascular resistance tended to decrease from a mean value of 11.4 +/- 1.28 units to 10.6 +/- 1.10 units. No changes could be observed either in ejection fraction or in cardiac output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Bevantolol is a novel beta 1-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The Study Group evaluated its therapeutic utility (100-300 mg bid) compared with propranolol (80-240 mg bid) in 266 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (WHO Grades I and II, sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 95 mmHg). There was no difference in their antihypertensive efficacy over six months, 77% being controlled (DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg) on bevantolol and 81% on propranolol. Hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg bid added later improved BP control in those incompletely controlled on bevantolol monotherapy. Both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists also reduced intraocular pressure. Bevantolol caused significantly fewer adverse effects than propranolol with many fewer withdrawals during long-term therapy. This unique clinical pharmacologic profile of bevantolol enhances its therapeutic usefulness and may relate to alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist activity, as well as to its beta 1-selectivity.", 
    "32": "The relationship between the extent of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the hemodynamic properties of dobutamine was investigated in patients scheduled for elective myocardial revascularization during isoflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia. Twenty patients had been treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs for at least 4 weeks before the study; 11 unblocked patients served as control group. The extent of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min was defined as the CD25 (chronotropic dose 25), representing the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Geometric mean CD25/70 kg was 3.8 micrograms in the control group, and 24.5 micrograms in the patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The authors found a significant inverse relationship between CD25 values and changes in cardiac index in response to three dobutamine infusion rates (1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), the correlation coefficients being -0.78, -0.79, and -0.82, respectively. Compared to unblocked patients, almost no change, or even a decrease, of the cardiac index was observed at higher degrees of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Moreover, there was a significant linear correlation (r = 0.66 - 0.75) between CD25 values and the effects of dobutamine on systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), i.e., SVRI decreased in control patients, but increased in patients with high degrees of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade. This unmasked vasocontrictive response to dobutamine was observed despite the fact that the majority of our patients had received cardioselective adrenergic blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "In 47 patients with chronic stable angina and proven coronary artery disease, abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents either as monotherapy or in combination with calcium antagonists (group 1, n = 25) was compared with abrupt withdrawal of calcium antagonist monotherapy (group 2, n = 22) as regards the occurrence of cardiac events and total ischemic activity detected by ambulatory monitoring. Reinstitution of medical therapy was required in 6 patients (4 in group 1 and 2 in group 2). Ambulatory monitoring was initiated for 36 hours on 3 occasions: before withdrawal, and again 2 and 5 days after withdrawal. The first 2 monitorings were performed in the hospital and the last during daily activity. In group 1, the frequency of total ischemia increased by 64 and 148% from monitoring occasions 1 to 2 and 1 to 3, respectively (p less than 0.01), and silent ischemia increased by 100 and 129%, respectively (p less than 0.01). However, no significant change in transient myocardial ischemia was noted in group 2. Heart rate at onset of ischemia increased significantly in group 1 (p less than 0.01), in contrast to group 2 which had significant increases only in out-of-hospital values (p less than 0.05). These results indicate that a rebound increase in ischemic activity (mainly silent) occurs after abrupt withdrawal of beta-receptor blockade in patients with chronic stable angina. This increase in ischemic activity may be caused by increased myocardial oxygen demand.", 
    "34": "A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study design was used to compare the antianginal efficacy of bevantolol (200 to 400 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) each administrated once daily for 8 weeks in 39 patients with chronic stable angina. Assessments were made using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring and treadmill exercise testing performed 22 to 24 hours after the last dose of medication. Both groups were comparable at the end of the placebo phase. In the bevantolol group, exercise time increased from 7.9 +/- 0.7 minutes with placebo to 9.3 +/- 0.7 minutes with bevantolol (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (p less than 0.05). Time to 1 mm ST depression was unaltered. Rest and exercise heart rate decreased (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.0005, respectively) as did exercise double product (p less than 0.0001). In the atenolol group exercise time increased from 7.1 +/- 0.7 minutes with placebo to 8.2 +/- 0.8 minutes with atenolol (p less than 0.02). Time to 1 mm ST depression increased (p less than 0.005) and rest and exercise heart rate and double product decreased (p less than 0.0001 and less than 0.05, respectively). When within-group differences between placebo and active drug were compared for bevantolol and atenolol, no significant differences were detected. Both drugs were well tolerated and reduced ambulatory heart rate throughout the 24 hours. This study confirms that both bevantolol and atenolol are effective antianginal agents. Bevantolol compares well with atenolol in the treatment of patients with chronic angina, and there was a similar response to exercise testing with the 2 drugs.", 
    "35": "Migraine is associated with increased platelet activity and an incidence of cerebrovascular ischemic events. Because cerebrovascular events might result from platelet aggregation, enhancing platelet activity further in the treatment of migraine is not desirable. beta-Adrenoceptor blockers effective in migraine prophylaxis include propranolol (nonselective) and metoprolol (beta 1-selective), but it is uncertain how beta-receptor subtype selectivity might influence platelet behavior in migraine. In 29 patients, comparable clinical responses were obtained with therapeutic doses during 1 month of treatment with propranolol, metoprolol, and the beta 2-selective Li 32-468. Propranolol increased and metoprolol decreased platelet aggregation and ATP release, and the effect of Li 32-468 could be related to that of propranolol. These actions can be largely explained in terms of what is known of platelet beta-receptors and therefore can be generalized to other effective beta-blockers. Since altered platelet activity does not account for the efficacy of these agents in migraine, the actions of beta-blockers on platelets should be considered as side effects. Those beta-blockers inhibiting platelet activity should be preferred in migraine treatment, assuming equal efficacy, which implies the use of beta 1-selective blockers.", 
    "36": "1. The effects of the alpha-beta-adrenergic antagonist labetalol on the activation of human platelets by adrenaline and other aggregating stimuli have been investigated. 2. Labetalol inhibited platelet aggregation and secretion induced by collagen and the second phase of aggregation caused by ADP, platelet activating factor, adrenaline and ionophore A23187. Adrenaline-induced platelet activation was inhibited by the lowest labetalol concentration. The response to Na arachidonate was minimally affected and the arachidonate-induced thromboxane B2 generation was only partially prevented. 3. The pre-incubation with low concentration of ionophore A23187 overcame labetalol's inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation. 4. Labetalol did not influence intraplatelet cyclic AMP levels. 5. The present investigation provided evidences that the modulation of human platelet function by labetalol could be related also to a decreased Ca2+ availability.", 
    "37": "The effect of peroral propranolol administration on the level of lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors was studied in six healthy volunteers using an acute exercise test. When no drug was used, a 15-min ergometer exercise period induced a significant increase in the receptor density (from 42 +/- 5 to 117 +/- 14 fmol/mg protein; mean +/- SEM), followed by a return to the pre-exercise level after a 1-hr rest. During propranolol administration (40 mg, three times daily), the basal receptor level (49 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein) did not change but the exercise-induced increment of the receptor density was significantly inhibited (peak value 79 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). This effect could not be explained by direct competition for receptor binding sites by propranolol nor by differences in the plasma adrenalin and noradrenaline concentrations during the two tests. The fact that propranolol interferes with the normal adaptation of the beta-adrenergic receptor level to acute exercise may explain some of the adverse effects of beta-blocking drugs on physical performance.", 
    "38": "To study the value of indexes of endothelial cell function in experimentally induced pulmonary microvascular injury, lung damage was produced in anesthetized dogs by intravenous injection of oleic acid (OA; n = 6), alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU; n = 5), or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; n = 6). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in serum and simultaneous measurements of serotonin (SER) and propranolol (PROP) pulmonary extraction along with several physiologic parameters were determined and compared with those obtained in a control group (n = 5) before and then at 2-h intervals for 8 h after administration of the toxic agent. ACE activity in serum showed a sustained and significant increase in the PMA and OA groups throughout the whole study period, whereas it decreased significantly at 4 h in the ANTU group. SER pulmonary uptake decreased significantly, but slightly, only in the PMA group at 8 h (-5%). At 6 and 8 h respectively, PROP extraction dropped significantly in the PMA (-11 and -13%) and OA (-13 and -19%) groups. This decrease in PROP extraction was likely to result from physiologic changes due to the development of pulmonary edema as suggested by the correlation between the changes in amine uptake and those affecting pulmonary artery pressure and total static respiratory compliance. The lack of effects on SER uptake by the lungs under these experimental conditions indicate that dissociation exists between metabolic dysfunction of pulmonary endothelial cells and fluid leakage.", 
    "39": "The pulmonary vascular responses to histamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine demonstrate tachyphylaxis following repetitive exposure in the isolated blood-perfused cat lung. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that this phenomenon was related to a change in the balance of antagonistic receptor activity. The protocol consisted of 5 consecutive dose-response maneuvers (DR I to V) to 1 amine in each animal separated by 1 h. Once the loss of the initial vasoconstrictor activity had occurred (DR I to IV), the animal was given a receptor blocking agent, either the beta blocker propranolol or the H2 blocker cimetidine, prior to a final dose-response maneuver (DR V). The dose-response relationships were analyzed in terms of 3 parameters: maximum response, slope, and ED50. All the experiments with norepinephrine (n = 6), epinephrine (n = 10), and histamine (n = 25) demonstrated a progressive loss of vasopressor activity as shown by reductions in the maximum response and slope between DR I to IV. In addition, histamine demonstrated a significant increase in ED50 from DR I to IV, which suggested a loss of sensitivity. The loss of vasoconstrictor activity to histamine and the catecholamines was restored by the administration of propranolol prior to DR V. In contrast, cimetidine did not restore the initial vasopressor activity of histamine. The loss of reactivity to histamine was not secondary to changes in circulating catecholamine levels, because the plasma catecholamine levels before DR I and immediately following DR V in a subset of animals (n = 5) were within the reported normal range for this species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The influence of blood pressure (BP) level and age on the baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and its autonomic nervous components was studied in genetically hypertensive (LH), normotensive (LN) and low blood pressure (LL) rats of the Lyon strains at 5, 9, 13 and 70 weeks of age. BRS was computed as the slope of the closest relationship, according to the cardiac response delay, between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart period changes induced by phenylephrine injections (3 micrograms/kg, i.v.) BRS and the relative importance of vagal and sympathetic components were determined in 4 conditions: 1) basal; 2) after beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 2 mg/kg i.v.); 3) after vagal blockade (atropine, 2 mg/kg i.v.); 4) after vagal and beta-adrenergic blockade (atropine and propranolol, 2 mg/kg, i.v. each). At 5 weeks of age, BRS did not differ between the 3 strains (0.50 +/- 0.05, 0.69 +/- 0.10 and 0.62 +/- 0.09 ms/mmHg in LH, LN and LL rats respectively). In LN rats, BRS increased sharply between 5 and 9 weeks (1.25 +/- 0.12 ms/mmHg) and then remained stable until 70 weeks of age (1.19 +/- 0.14 ms/mmHg). Such an increase did not occur in LH rats and their BRS value was lower than that of LN and LL controls starting from 9 weeks of age. The vagal component of BRS was found to be more important than the sympathetic one in adult rats whatever the strain (80 p. 100 vs 20 p. 100).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

An increase in total phospholipids of lung extracts as well as that of separate fractions of phospholipids especially of phosphatidylcholine was revealed along with a direct interrelationship between the alveoli area and the phosphatidylcholine rate. The alterations in surfactant phospholipids are regarded as a compensatory reaction maintaining alveolar stabilization in the case of sympathectomy.", 
    "42": "Clenbuterol is one of the few beta adrenergic agonists that readily passes the blood-brain barrier. Hence, the behavioral effects in rats of systemic administrations of clenbuterol have been used as a reflection of the activation of central beta receptors. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the reduction in locomotor activity induced by clenbuterol is mediated by central rather than peripheral beta receptors. First, dose-dependent reductions in ambulation, holepoking, and rearing were established following intraperitoneal injections of 0.004 to 1.0 mg/kg clenbuterol. These effects were then found to be similar to those of 0.4 mg/kg isoproterenol, a mixed beta adrenergic agonist that does not enter the brain after systemic administration. The behaviorally suppressive effects of either 0.4 mg/kg isoproterenol or 0.05 mg/kg clenbuterol were found to be completely antagonized by pretreatment with a 10.0 mg/kg dose of nadolol, a beta antagonist that does not penetrate the brain when administered systemically. Nadolol itself had no significant effects on behavior. These results indicate that these behavioral effects of systemic administrations of clenbuterol are mediated by the activation of peripheral rather than central beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "43": "The subclass of beta-adrenergic receptors mediating glycogenolysis in slices from cerebral cortex of the mouse, incubated in the presence of [3H]glucose, was identified by comparing the relative potencies of agonists and the inhibition constants of antagonists to those found on reference systems. (+/-)Isoprenaline, (-)adrenaline and (-)noradrenaline produced a concentration-related glycogenolysis with Kact values of 2.2 x 10(-8) M, 2.8 x 10(-7) M and 3.6 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Zinterol, a selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist, did not produce any glycogenolytic response even in a large concentration. Salbutamol, a predominantly beta 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, elicited in a very large concentration (10(-4) M) less than 40% glycogenolysis, an effect which was not related to stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. The predominantly beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, practolol and metoprolol shifted the concentration-response curve to noradrenaline to the right, with apparent Ki values of 8.0 x 10(-7) M and 7.6 x 10(-8) M, respectively, close to those reported in the rat heart. These various data indicate that the glycogenolytic response is selectively mediated by beta 1-adrenergic receptors. Under experimental conditions which were strictly identical to those used to measure glycogenolysis, a saturable binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to the slices occurred with Kd and Bmax values consistent with corresponding values on cell free preparations. Whereas the Ki values of antagonists were similar on the two systems, the Kact values of agonists on glycogenolysis were 10 times less than the Ki values for the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol. This suggests that the maximal glycogenolytic response is elicited for a partial receptor occupancy.", 
    "44": "1. We performed an enzymatic characterization of two different fractionation procedures of ventricles from rat hearts. The enzymatic assays covered succinic dehydrogenase as a marker for inner mitochondrial membranes, monoamine oxidase as a marker for outer mitochondrial membranes, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and RNA as endoplasmatic reticular markers, acid phosphatase as a lysosomal marker, and lactic dehydrogenase as a marker for the \"soluble\" compartment; DNA was estimated for nuclear contamination. 2. The plasma membrane markers 5'-nucleotidase, Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase, Na+-K+-ATPase, and adenylate cyclase were determined. 3. The roughly prepared membrane fractions showed increased yields of the membrane markers; the number of beta receptors, determined with (-)-[3H] dihydroalprenolol and DL-propranolol, amounted to 68 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein (KD = 3390 +/- 450 pmol, Hill coefficient = 1.5). 4. The membrane fraction prepared with a linear sucrose gradient showed an increased inner mitochondrial membrane marker; presumably the outer mitochondrial membrane was stripped off. The beta-receptor number was 39 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein (KD = 6250 +/- 300 pmol; Hill coefficient = 1.2).", 
    "45": "Ponies with recurrent airway obstruction have hyperresponsive airways during acute disease exacerbations but not during clinical remission. We examined the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol on airway responsiveness to aerosol histamine in six ponies with recurrent airway obstruction and six age- and gender-matched controls. Measurements were made with principal ponies in clinical remission (period A) and during an acute period of airway obstruction (period B). beta-Adrenergic blockade did not change airway responsiveness, dynamic compliance (Cdyn), or pulmonary resistance (RL) in either group of ponies at period A or in the control ponies at period B. In principal ponies at period B, propranolol significantly increased RL but was without effect on Cdyn or airway responsiveness. We conclude that the beta-adrenergic system is involved in the control of central airway caliber in principal ponies at period B but that this system does not seem to be involved in the mechanism of airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine.", 
    "46": "In order to assess whether blood pressure reduction with atenolol or enalapril is associated with changes in renal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, we studied the effects of 10 weeks therapy in 20 subjects with mild or moderate hypertension. After a four week placebo run-in period, subjects were randomized to receive either atenolol 50-100 mg/day or enalapril 5-20 mg/day for 10 weeks, then crossed over to the alternate active drug. Both drugs lowered blood pressure: placebo 147/97, atenolol 135/87, enalapril 132/87 (p less than 0.05, for both). Atenolol reduced resting heart rate but neither drug changed body weight, serum sodium or potassium or creatinine clearance. Intravenous furosemide was used as a standardized stimulus of renal PG synthesis. Neither drug changed the excretion rates of 6ketoPGF1 alpha or thromboxane B2 (hydrolysis products of PGI2 and thromboxane A2 respectively). Diuretic, kaliuretic, and natriuretic effects of furosemide were also not affected. Plasma renin activity was increased by enalapril but reduced slightly by atenolol. Subjects with more marked blood pressure reduction showed responses to furosemide no different than those with less effect. We conclude that blood pressure reduction with atenolol or enalapril does not change the response of renal eicosanoid synthesis to acute stimulation with furosemide.", 
    "47": "1. Electrical stimulation of the C1 area of the rostral ventrolateral medulla in rats elicits an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). 2. This increase in MAP is attenuated by intra-hypothalamic and intracisternal administration of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-propranolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118551. 3. The selective beta 1-antagonist atenolol and (+)-propranolol, which is inactive on beta-adrenoceptors, did not alter the increase in MAP produced by stimulation of the C1 area. 4. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan enhanced the effects of C1 stimulation on MAP when administered either into the posterior hypothalamus or intracisternally. 5. The results indicate that beta 2- and alpha 2-receptors both have a role in the mediation of the rise in MAP during stimulation of the C1 area and that the receptors involved are located both within the hypothalamus and the spinal cord.", 
    "48": "1. The effects of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation on the action potential and force of contraction were investigated in human isolated ventricular heart muscle and compared with those of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. 2. The maximal stimulation by isoprenaline of beta-adrenoceptors produced large changes in the force of contraction, which were accompanied by moderate increases in the height of the action potential. The maximal inotropic effect produced by stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors with phenylephrine, in the presence of propranolol (1 mumol 1(-1)) was much smaller (about 10% of that seen in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation), and no significant changes of the action potential configuration were observed. 3. The effects of noradrenaline and adrenaline on the force of contraction were not affected by prazosin. 4. It is concluded that the adrenoceptor-mediated changes of the force of contraction (in the presence of either noradrenaline or adrenaline) in the human ventricle are due virtually exclusively to the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "49": "1. The effects of atenolol (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist without partial agonistic activity) and pindolol (beta 1- and beta 2-antagonist with partial agonistic activity) were studied on basal coronary vascular tone and on the phorbol ester-induced coronary vasoconstriction in the rat perfused heart. 2. The addition of the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 1.8 X 10(-8)-1.6 X 10(-7) M) into the perfusion fluid during perfusion of rat heart at constant flow caused a dose-dependent, sustained increase in perfusion pressure. The vasoconstrictor response in hearts of reserpine-treated rats to infusion of TPA was similar to that of non-reserpine treated hearts. 3. Infusion of a calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 at a concentration of 4 X 10(-7) M enhanced, whereas isoprenaline (1 X 10(-5) M), dibuturyl-cyclic AMP (1.6 X 10(-4) M) and forskolin (1 X 10(-6) M), which elevate intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP, all inhibited the coronary vasoconstriction induced by TPA. 4. Pindolol, in doses which produced comparable inhibition of isoprenaline-induced tachycardia, dose-dependently attenuated the phorbol ester-induced increase in perfusion pressure, whereas atenolol had no effect. The inhibitory action of pindolol (2 X 10(-5) M) on TPA-induced vasoconstriction was blocked by addition of 2.2 X 10(-5) M propranolol into the perfusion fluid. When infused alone, atenolol (2 X 10(-4) M) significantly increased coronary vascular tone, but pindolol had no effect. 5. The present results indicate that pindolol has coronary vasodilator properties due to stimulation of vascular beta-adrenoceptors. If stenosis dilatation of coronary artery spasm is an important component of the anti-anginal effect of beta-blocking drugs, the possession of partial agonistic property by a beta-blocking drug may be of importance in maintaining coronary flow.",

The increase in blood glucose was accompanied by an inhibition of insulin secretion and basal lipolysis. 2. Yohimbine infused at a rate of 20 micrograms kg-1 min-1 suppressed clonidine-induced hyperglycaemia and blocked the inhibitory effect on insulin secretion mediated by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. 3. The intravenous infusion of amidephrine (10 micrograms kg-1 min-1) induced an increase in insulin secretion in the absence of patent hyperglycaemia. Prazosin, 0.3 mg kg-1 s.c. selectively antagonized the effect of amidephrine on insulin secretion. 4. Isoprenaline infusion (4.4 micrograms kg-1 min-1) evoked a significant increase in blood glycerol and immunoreactive insulin plasma levels. Both responses were clearly attenuated when alpha 2-adrenoceptors were simultaneously stimulated by selective (clonidine) and less selective (phenylephrine, 20 micrograms kg-1 min-1) agonists. 5. Amidephrine infusion did not induce appreciable changes in blood glycerol nor did it modify, isoprenaline-induced lipolytic response. 6. Simultaneous infusion of isoprenaline and amidephrine induced a remarkable increase in insulin secretion. 7. It is concluded that in normal fasted rabbits stimulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors depresses basal and beta-adrenoceptor mediated lipolysis and insulin secretion. On the other hand, selective stimulation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors does not affect lipolysis but induces insulin release. Simultaneous stimulation of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors potentiates the insulin secretory response.", 
    "51": "Electrical stimulation of the distal vagal cervical end in urethane chloralose anesthetized cats caused bradycardia that could be both enhanced and inhibited during sympathetic activation. Sympathetic activation was induced by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow of the spinal cord at the level of Th 1-Th 3 in pitched cats or by an intravenous injection of tyramine. It has been proved pharmacologically that alpha-adrenoceptors are involved in potentiation. The inhibitory influences are realized via both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "52": "In the presence of phentolamine, stimulation of the cat splanchnic nerve decreased the resistance of the superior mesenteric arterial bed. This effect was not significantly influenced by sulpiride. Sulpiride, in the presence of phentolamine, did not inhibit the decrease in resistance in animals pretreated with guanethidine but propranolol or ablation of the adrenal glands prevented the effect of stimulation. These results are not compatible with the assumption that dopamine released from dopaminergic nerves is involved in the vasodilatation but do provide evidence for the role of beta-adrenoceptors and circulating catecholamines in the vasodilatation of mesenteric vessels.", 
    "53": "Electrical responses evoked by perivascular nerve stimulation were recorded from rat small intrapulmonary artery with the microelectrode technique. Nerve stimulation with a single pulse produced an excitatory junction potential that was insensitive to phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, ketanserin, mepyramine, and guanethidine but was abolished by tetrodotoxin. Treatment with reserpine in vivo or with 6-hydroxydopamine in vitro had no significant effect on the amplitude of the junction potentials. In the mesenteric arteries from the same rats, these procedures led to the inhibition of the junction potentials, confirming adequate functional sympathectomy. Low concentrations of alpha, beta-methylene ATP attenuated the amplitude of the excitatory junction potential without changing the membrane potential. The membrane depolarization induced by norepinephrine or serotonin were not. It is concluded that the excitatory junction potential in rat pulmonary artery results from the release of a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitter from perivascular nerves that are not sympathetic and that the most likely transmitter is ATP. Such neurotransmission may play a role in the regulation of regional pulmonary blood flow.", 
    "54": "The mechanism(s) of the waning of the vasodilation and increase in vascular permeability during prolonged local intraarterial infusions of bradykinin (BK) was investigated in this study. Treatment with phentolamine or saralasin failed to prevent the waning of the vasodilation during the prolonged infusion of BK into forelimbs perfused at constant flow. In contrast, BK produced a sustained vasodilator response after treatment with captopril. Forelimb weight and lymph analysis were used to quantitate edema formation and to determine the duration of the increase in vascular permeability during prolonged local intra-arterial infusions of BK into forelimbs perfused at constant flow. The lymph-to-plasma ratios (L/P) for protein and FITC-Dextrans (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans, 70,000 Da) were determined, and clearances for protein and FITC-D were calculated. BK markedly increased fluid filtration, the protein L/P, and protein clearance resulting in edema formation. The protein L/P remained markedly elevated throughout the experimental period. The FITC-D L/P was markedly increased in the groups of animals in which the tracer was injected intravenously at the start or 8 min after the start of the prolonged BK infusion. In the groups of animals in which the tracer was injected intravenously 15-60 min after the start of the prolonged BK infusion, the FITC-D L/P failed to exceed the FITC-D L/P in control animals, although the protein L/P remained elevated. Pretreatment with both captopril and propranolol dramatically potentiated the magnitude of the increase in protein clearance, the filtration rate, and edema formation produced by BK but failed to affect the duration of the transient increase in vascular permeability.", 
    "55": "We have previously documented predominant intraluminal release of serotonin (5-HT) following activation of muscarinic receptors on enterochromaffin cells. Gronstad et al. reported that portal venous release of 5-HT in response to vagal stimulation was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether 5-HT release induced by the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, is mediated by enteric nerves or is a direct action at the enterochromaffin cell level. We mounted rabbit duodenal mucosal sheets stripped of muscularis in modified Ussing chambers and measured release of 5-HT in response to 10(-5) M isoproterenol, in the presence and absence of the neural conduction blocker tetrotoxin, 10(-6) M. Serotonin was measured in the buffer bathing the mucosal and submucosal surfaces by HPLC. In the presence of isoproterenol, total (mucosal and submucosal) 5-HT release (21.0 +/- 4.9 ng/cm2/45 min) was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than that in untreated controls (7.8 +/- 2.7 ng/cm2/45 min); release was predominantly toward the submucosal surface. In the presence of tetrodotoxin alone, net 5-HT release was significantly (P less than 0.05) increased to 12.8 +/- 2.8 ng/cm2/45 min. In tetrodotoxin-treated mucosa, isoproterenol increased 5-HT release to 28.6 +/- 5.3 ng/cm2/45 min which was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that with tetrodotoxin alone. Since 5-HT release was increased even in the presence of neural blockade, these results suggest that activation of beta-adrenergic receptors on or near enterochromaffin cells induces release of 5-HT predominantly toward the submucosal surface.", 
    "56": "[3H]Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding of membranes of adult pancreas differed from that of pancreas of young rats, and the DHA binding in the presence of atenolol or butoxamine also was different in the two age groups. The adult pancreas had 93% beta 2- and 7% beta 1-adrenoceptors and did not exhibit an increased incorporation of [3H]thymidine into deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) following 2 days of DL-isoproterenol (ISO) administration; in contrast, pancreas of the 20-day-old rat had 71% beta 2-adrenoceptors and 27% beta 1-adrenoceptors and exhibited a 34-fold increase over that of adult, and a 6-fold increase over that of the control 20-day-old pancreas. Acinar cell differentiation was also accelerated by a 7-day regimen of ISO administration from 13 to 20 days of age. These growth responses to ISO appear to be beta 1 mediated. The lack of beta 1-adrenoceptors in the adult may account for the failure of the adult pancreas to exhibit a growth response to ISO.", 
    "57": "Receptor mapping procedures based on the methodology of Crippen are used to study the beta 2-adrenergic receptor system in intact Chang liver cells. In cases of agonists, the presence of both a low- and high-affinity receptor state is assumed, whereas antagonists bind to the low-affinity state only. The high-affinity state is considered to contain the \"functional\" binding site responsible for formation of the second messenger (cAMP), whereas the low-affinity state is assumed to be the \"true\" (physiological) low-affinity state. Both receptor states are taken into account in the receptor mapping process. Characterization of the high- and low-affinity states made it possible to identify features that make a state an antagonist or agonist. The receptor model found for the low-affinity state of the beta-adrenergic receptor present in an intact cell system is compared to the low-affinity state previously obtained for this receptor present on a membrane preparation of the bovine skeletal muscle in the presence of high amounts of Gpp(NH)p guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imidotriphosphate). Remarkable differences are found between the two receptor models. The tentative conclusion is drawn that these differences in low-affinity states most probably are artificial and are caused by the different pharmacological properties (e.g., intrinsic activity) of the labeled ligands used in displacement experiments for determining the affinities of the drugs.", 
    "58": "Recent studies have shown that 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OH-E2) synthesized locally from estradiol (E2) stimulates progesterone production by granulosa cells (GC) and enhances the action of other trophic hormones. A particularly strong synergistic interaction between 2-OH-E2 and beta-adrenergic agonists was observed. Therefore, the present studies were undertaken to determine if this synergism was due to a 2-OH-E2-stimulated increase in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites in GC. Binding of the 125I-labeled beta-adrenergic ligand iodocyanopindolol ([125I]iodo-CYP) to GC was evaluated and was found to be saturable with time and ligand concentration, and of high affinity (Kd = 29 +/- 8 pM; maximum binding = 0.55 +/- 0.02 fmol/10(6) cells). Rank order potency for agonist/antagonist binding was consistent with a beta-adrenergic receptor: propranolol greater than isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine. 2-OH-E2 did not compete for the [125I]iodo-CYP-binding sites. Incubation of cultured porcine GC with 2-OH-E2 caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in the number of specific [125I]iodo-CYP-binding sites. Averaged over eight separate experiments, 4-day treatment with 4 micrograms/ml 2-OH-E2 increased the number of [125I]iodo-CYP-binding sites 3.1 +/- 0.9-fold above the control value (P less than 0.05). A similar 4-day treatment with 2 micrograms/ml E2 or 200 ng/ml LH or FSH was without effect on [125I]iodo-CYP binding (P greater than 0.05) despite stimulation of progesterone secretion to a degree similar to that seen with 2-OH-E2. These results support the hypothesis that 2-OH-E2 produced by GC may enhance progesterone production stimulated by catecholamines, in part by increasing the numbers of beta-adrenergic binding sites on GC.", 
    "59": "The electrophysiologic effects of circulating epinephrine in humans were examined in four study groups of 10 subjects each. In 10 subjects without structural heart disease (Group 1) and in 10 patients with coronary disease or dilated cardiomyopathy (Group 2) epinephrine infusion at 25 and 50 ng/kg body weight per min for 14 min resulted in an elevation of the plasma epinephrine concentration in the physiologic range. In both groups it produced a dose-dependent decrease in the effective refractory period of the atrium, atrioventricular (AV) node and ventricle and improvement in AV node conduction. Epinephrine facilitated the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in 3 of the 20 subjects. In Group 3, a beta-adrenergic blocking dose of propranolol was added to the infusion of 50 ng/kg per min of epinephrine. Propranolol not only reversed the effects of epinephrine, but also lengthened these variables compared with baseline values. In Group 4, propranolol was administered first, followed by 50 ng/kg per min of epinephrine. Propranolol alone slowed AV node conduction and mildly prolonged the refractory periods. In the presence of beta-blockade, epinephrine had no effect on AV node properties but resulted in a lengthening of the atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods. In conclusion, epinephrine in physiologic doses shortens the effective refractory period of the atrium, AV node and ventricle, improves AV node conduction and may facilitate the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The overall electrophysiologic effects of epinephrine result from stimulation of beta-receptors. Stimulation of alpha-receptors by epinephrine has no effect on the AV node but prolongs the effective refractory period of the atrium and ventricle, partially offsetting the shortening of refractory periods mediated by beta-receptor stimulation.", 
    "60": "1. Isoprenaline (10 nM to 1 microM) and forskolin (0.6-100 microM) depolarized single guinea-pig myocytes studied in vitro. Under voltage clamp both agents caused an inward current to flow. 2. These effects were abolished by propranolol (100 nM) and the beta1-antagonist metoprolol (100-200 nM), but not by the beta2-agonist [corrected] salbutamol (1 microM). 3. The interaction of isoprenaline with forskolin, caffeine or isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) on current amplitude was as expected if all of these drugs were causing inward current by increasing intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Low concentrations of forskolin (less than 600 nM) or IBMX (less than 20 microM) potentiated the effect of isoprenaline, whereas isoprenaline caused no further inward current in cells in which high concentrations of forskolin (600 nM-100 microM) or IBMX (20 microM-1 mM) were already evoking maximum inward current. 4. Isoprenaline-induced inward current was reduced 30-50% by acetylcholine (10-30 microM). This action of acetylcholine was blocked by atropine (100 nM). 5. The effect of isoprenaline on holding current was critically dependent on temperature. The onset of the current was delayed and its amplitude reduced as the myocyte was cooled from 37 degrees C to ambient temperature (22-24 degrees C). 6. Isoprenaline-induced inward current was not affected by the potassium channel blockers barium (2 mM) or tetraethylammonium (TEA; 10-20 mM). The amplitude of the inward current did not vary as a function of [K+]o. 7. The inward current was not affected by the calcium channel blockers cadmium 1 mM, or nifedipine (10 microM), or when internal calcium was reduced by including EGTA in the recording electrode filling solution. 8. The amplitude of the current was also unaffected by caesium (5 mM), which blocks the hyperpolarization-activated, non-specific channel if, or by strophanthidin (10 microM) which blocks the Na+-K+ pump. It was unchanged by substitution of external chloride by isethionate. 9. The inward current was absent when external sodium was replaced by the impermeant ion tetramethylammonium (TMA). 10. Isoprenaline- and forskolin-induced inward currents were associated with an increase in both membrane chord conductance and noise. The increase in conductance was most readily measured at potentials where the inwardly rectifying potassium channel, iK1, was small, or when iK1 was blocked by the addition of barium (2 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "61": "We measured the amount of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DG) in rat hearts using thin-layer chromatography and a flame ionization detection technique, since 1,2-DG is thought to play a central role in the metabolism of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In response to exogenous norepinephrine, a significant increase in 1,2-DG content in the myocardium was observed over 10-60 min, achieving an 80% increase over unstimulated controls at 60 min. On the other hand, the cholesterol content and six species of phospholipids were not significantly affected. In order to elucidate the mechanism of 1,2-DG accumulation elicited by norepinephrine, alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists were given. Pretreatment with phentolamine and prazosin, but not propranolol, inhibited the norepinephrine-induced 1,2-DG accumulation. Yohimbine appeared to have a partially inhibitory effect. These results suggest that myocardial norepinephrine-related 1,2-DG formation, which is likely to activate protein kinase C, is associated with alpha-adrenergic receptors, especially alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "62": "The cardiopulmonary bypass technique was used to compare the effects of dopamine and norepinephrine on venous return, and to identify the adrenoceptors involved in the responses. Intraarterial boluses of dopamine and norepinephrine produced similar increases in mean arterial pressure and similar increases in venous return, but dopamine required 10-30 x larger doses than norepinephrine to produce the same effect. Phenoxybenzamine virtually abolished the venous responses to the lowest doses of both agonists and diminished the venous responses to larger doses. Propranolol had little or no effect on venous responses to the low doses but substantially diminished the responses to larger doses. These results indicate that the increase in venous return produced by dopamine or norepinephrine involves both alpha and beta adrenoceptors. To determine whether the beta adrenoceptor belonged to subtype beta 1, the \"selective\" beta 2 agonist, salbutamol, was used. The reported affinity of salbutamol in dogs for arterial beta 2 receptors is fivefold greater than that for cardiac beta 1 receptors. However, the dose-response curves of salbutamol on the venous and arterial systems overlapped, indicating that the increase in venous return represents a combination of properties common to both beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "63": "Mice have been used in studies of the immunology or pathology of several different disorders affecting the lung. However, the value of the mouse for the analysis of pulmonary pathophysiology has been limited by the lack of methods for measuring lung function in the living animal. We report here the first method for measuring pulmonary conductance (GL) and compliance (Cdyn) in tracheostomized mechanically ventilated mice. We used this method to characterize the mouse's pulmonary responses to several putative bronchoconstrictor agonists. GL and Cdyn were decreased by intravenous infusions of methacholine, norepinephrine, or serotonin. Reproducible responses were not detected after infusions of histamine, prostaglandins D2 or F2 alpha, leukotrienes C4 or D4, substance P, or platelet-activating factor. The pattern of airway responsiveness to these agonists in the mouse is similar to that reported for the rat; in contrast to the rat, the mouse has many well-characterized strains or mutants with deficiencies of immunologic or inflammatory cells or mediators. As a result, this model offers unique advantages for identifying the roles of individual inflammatory cell types or mediators in pulmonary processes, including pulmonary anaphylaxis.", 
    "64": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of castration with or without testosterone propionate (TP) administration (one daily injection of 1 mg for 10 days) on the fat cell lipolytic activity in male hamsters. Basal and maximal lipolytic responses to the pure beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the mixed alpha 2-and beta-adrenergic agonist epinephrine, and the nonadrenergic compounds ACTH and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were all reduced by half in castrated animals. TP treatment restored these defective responses to control values, except the response to epinephrine which remained paradoxically unchanged. Sensitivity of lipolysis to epinephrine was unimpaired by castration but markedly reduced (10-fold) in TP-treated castrated hamsters. The antilipolytic potencies of the alpha 2-component of epinephrine and of the two alpha 2-agonists, UK 14304 and clonidine, were reduced by half in castrated animals, and returned to a value slightly higher than control after TP treatment. These changes in lipolysis were accompanied by parallel alterations in the stimulated cAMP responses to isoproterenol and forskolin but not to epinephrine. The latter was either unimpaired by castration or was clearly inhibited after TP treatment. Castration also induced a 2-fold decrease in the inhibitory potency of clonidine toward forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. Finally, these changes in the potency of clonidine were accompanied by parallel variations of the number of fat cell alpha 2-adrenoreceptors. These results indicate that testosterone in vivo, while increasing the beta-adrenergic lipolytic action of catecholamines (possibly through enhancement of the adenylate cyclase activity), promotes, to a greater extent, their alpha 2-adrenoreceptor-mediated antilipolytic potency. By providing the first demonstration that the androgenic status controls the functional alpha 2/beta-adrenergic balance in fat cells, this study also emphasizes the potential importance of such a control in the mechanisms underlying the sex-related differences in adipose tissue regional distribution and fat cell size.", 
    "65": "In several syndromes sudden death is associated with a long Q-T interval on the electrocardiogram. Current treatment is aimed at correcting a notional imbalance of cardiac sympathetic drive. Although this approach can be effective, the primary disorder may be a defect in the cellular mechanism that alters the length of the ventricular action potential, and hence the Q-T interval, in response to a change of heart rate. Such defects may be underdiagnosed because the long Q-T syndromes are defined simply in terms of a prolonged Q-T interval, without consideration of the fact that susceptibility to arrhythmias is likely to be due, not to a lengthened Q-T per se, but to an absence or alteration of the normal Q-T shortening in response to an increase of heart rate. People susceptible to R-on-T related arrhythmias could be identified by measurement of the dependence of the Q-T interval on heart rate and how quickly the Q-T interval adapts to a change in rate.", 
    "66": "The effects of noradrenaline (NA) on the responsiveness of cultured cerebellar neurons to excitatory amino acids were intracellularly investigated. NA applied to external medium to a final concentration of 10 microM or lower slightly decreased the firing frequency of spontaneous spikes, induced a small hyperpolarization or slightly increased the input resistance of Purkinje cells. In addition, bath-applied NA was found to enhance the depolarizations induced by iontophoretically applied glutamate and aspartate but to a smaller extent for the latter. These direct and modulating effects of NA were also observed when NA was applied by iontophoresis. The sites sensitive to iontophoresed NA were found to be not uniformly distributed but localized in restricted regions on individual Purkinje cells. The enhancement by NA of the glutamate or aspartate response was blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists, propranolol or pindolol, and extracellularly applied cAMP mimicked the NA action. These results suggest the possibility that NA physiologically modulates excitatory amino acid-mediating synaptic transmission in the cerebellum probably by acting on beta-rather than alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "67": "Recently, Somberg, in a preliminary report (1983), noted that electrical stimulation of the area postrema causes an increase in coronary vascular resistance. The increase in resistance was mediate by an increase in sympathetic activity as it was counteracted by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade. The purpose of our study was to confirm the findings of Somberg by using the method of chemical-induced activation of cell bodies in the area postrema. This was done by bilateral topical application of kainic acid to the area postrema of cats while monitoring coronary blood flow, heart rate, arterial blood pressure and the ECG. Topical application of kainic acid produced an increase in coronary vascular resistance (43 +/- 13%, P less than 0.05), S-T segment changes, increases in heart rate (60 +/- 10, P less than 0.05) and arterial blood pressure (88 +/- 20, P less than 0.05) and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. All of these effects were prevented by pretreating animals with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent, phentolamine. These results suggest that chemical excitation of area postrema neurons produces coronary constriction that is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and alpha-adrenoceptors on coronary vessels.", 
    "68": "The localization of a novel serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) recognition site named 5-HT1D was studied by autoradiography in human postmortem brain material. Serotonin-1 sites were labeled with [3H]5-HT. The different subpopulations of 5-HT1 sites were investigated by the use of unlabeled selective compounds. 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-[N,N-di-n-propyl-amino]tetralin) was used to block [3H]5-HT binding to 5-HT1A, the beta-blocker (-)-21 009 (4-[3-ter-butyl-amino-2-hydroxy-propoxy]indol-2-carbonic acid isopropyl ester) to 5-HT1B and the ergoline mesulergine to 5-HT1C recognition sites. 5-HT1D sites were defined as the binding sites remaining when both 8-OH-DPAT and mesulergine were added to the incubation medium. Under these conditions, 5-HT1D sites represented a high proportion of total [3H]5-HT binding sites in the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. Lower proportions were observed in other brain areas such as the hippocampal formation and raph\u00e9 nuclei. 5-HT1D sites thus represent the majority of 5-HT1 binding sites in the striatonigral pathway in man. This localization suggests an involvement of these sites in the mediation of serotoninergic mechanisms in basal ganglia functions and a possible role in brain diseases where these areas are known to be involved.", 
    "69": "The hemodynamic effects of the class III drug D-sotalol and of the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist D,L-sotalol were compared in 16 rats (2 mg/kg i.v.). A group with NaCl-infusion served as control (n = 10). Besides measurements in the intact circulation isovolumic registrations were performed to examine the left ventricular myocardial function without interferences. D,L-sotalol significantly reduced the dp/dtmax (61%) and the peak isovolumic left ventricular pressure (64%). It lowered the heart rate by 13% and slightly increased the mean aortic pressure to 107% (p less than 0.05). D-sotalol, in contrast, caused only a very transient reduction of the dp/dtmax and was comparable to the controls already 5 min after injection. The results demonstrate, that the D-enantiomer is largely avoid of the hemodynamic effects of the racemic D,L-sotalol after intravenous injection.", 
    "70": "We evaluated the immediate intraocular pressure increase after extracapsular cataract surgery in 58 eyes. Two to three hours postoperatively, 34 eyes (59%) developed an intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 25 mm Hg. We found an intraocular pressure of at least 40 mm Hg in seven eyes. Mean intraocular pressure two to three hours postoperatively was 8.9 +/- 9.8 mm Hg greater than the preoperative intraocular pressure. The use of intraocular sodium hyaluronate had no apparent effect on intraocular pressure.", 
    "71": "Immobilization stress increased the density of imipramine binding sites in platelet and cortical membranes and there was an increased serotonin uptake in platelets. There was a decrease in desipramine binding and noradrenaline uptake in lymphocytes. Our results show that stress acts on the mediator systems in various ways.", 
    "72": "A reproducible behavioral correlate of aging in rodents is deficient performance of inhibitory avoidance memory tasks. Impaired performance has been attributed, in part, to age-related changes in brain norepinephrine (NE) system function. To determine whether supplementation of brain NE can ameliorate avoidance deficits in aged animals, we transplanted noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons from fetal rat donors into the third cerebral ventricle of 24-month-old male F344 rats. Aged rats that received NE-containing grafts exhibited significant improvement of inhibitory avoidance retention performance compared to both unoperated aged animals and aged animals that received grafts of cerebellar tissue. Improved behavioral performance was prevented by pretreatment of NE graft recipients with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, propranolol, and was mimicked by chronic intraventricular infusion of NE. Taken together, our findings support the view that age-related declines in brain NE content contribute to age-related deficits in inhibitory avoidance performance, and that NE replacement therapy can improve performance of this task in aged rats.", 
    "73": "Therapeutic balloon coronary angioplasty provides a useful model for studying the effects of epicardial coronary artery occlusion in conscious humans. In addition, it is a potent model in which the effectiveness of interventions designed to ameliorate ischemia can be evaluated. Whereas intravenous beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and nitrates appear to have a limited protective effect, the regional (i.e., intracoronary) use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and calcium antagonists seem more potent. Currently, coronary venous retroperfusion with arterial blood does not appear practical, and the intraaortic balloon is a useful adjunctive measure in relatively few patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In contrast, the direct anterograde delivery of oxygen-rich blood or fluorocarbons holds promise as a reliable means of providing local myocardial protection. If ischemia could be markedly reduced, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty might be applied safely in more high-risk clinical settings. In addition, if prolonged balloon inflation could be performed, there might be an increase in primary success rate and possibly a reduction in restenosis rate.", 
    "74": "To evaluate current strategies for the management of unstable angina, 104 consecutive patients admitted to the coronary care unit with unstable angina during a 6-month period were followed prospectively. Although 58 patients had symptomatic relief with the initiation of intensive medical therapy, 46 (44%) continued to have episodes of angina despite maximal tolerated triple-drug antianginal therapy as well as aspirin or heparin, or both. In-hospital mortality for the 104 patients was 4%. The incidence of myocardial infarction was 8%, and differed (p less than 0.01) for the medically responsive group (3%) vs the medically refractory group (13%). Based on clinical status and coronary anatomy, patients were referred for either bypass surgery (46%), coronary angioplasty (41%) or continued medical therapy (13%). Choice of therapy varied according to the extent of coronary disease, with coronary angioplasty attempted in 72% of patients with 1-vessel disease, 44% of patients with 2-vessel disease and 7% of patients with 3-vessel disease. Angioplasty was performed with an initial success rate of 88%, and compared favorably with bypass surgery in terms of in-hospital mortality (0 vs 11%), late mortality (2.8 vs 7.7%), freedom from angina (62 vs 69%) and subsequent employment (44 vs 27%) at 18 months follow-up. The favorable results of angioplasty in this prospective observational study suggest that additional randomized trials should be conducted in this important patient group.", 
    "75": "To study whether restoration of a normal circulatory system could be achieved with antihypertensive treatment, 13 hypertensive men with structural cardiovascular changes and 37 normotensive control subjects were investigated by echocardiography, apexcardiography, plethysmography, inulin and p-amino-hippurate clearance, and determination of 24-hour urinary excretion of albumin, first at age 49 years and again seven years later. All men were untreated at the first investigation. Immediately thereafter, therapy with the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol tartrate was initiated in the hypertensive men. Seven years of antihypertensive treatment resulted in (1) normalization of central and peripheral hemodynamic variables, (2) reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy in proportion to achieved blood pressure control, (3) normalization of systolic wall stress and a well-preserved systolic left ventricular function, (4) normalization of diastolic left ventricular function, and (5) normalization of increased microalbuminuria and a decrease in renal vascular resistance, with no change in glomerular filtration rate compared with control subjects. In conclusion, the findings strongly indicate that regression of cardiovascular structural changes can be achieved with long-term antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "76": "The mesolimbocortical dopamine (DA) system innervates several brain regions including the hippocampus. The aim of the present study was both to identify and to pharmacologically characterize the DA receptors located in this brain area. The results show that different agonists for D1 DA receptors, such as DA itself, SKF82526 and (-)-apomorphine, were able to increase adenylate cyclase activity, and these effects were antagonized by haloperidol and SCH 23390. Moreover bromocriptine, lisuride and RU 24213, which are agonists for D2DA receptors, inhibited the cyclic AMP generating system and these effects were prevented by (-)-sulpiride. According to the paradigm that D1 DA receptors are linked with adenylate cyclase in a stimulatory way, while D2 DA receptors are linked with the same enzyme in an inhibitory way, our results indicate the presence of both D1 and D2 receptors in rat hippocampus. Localization studies show that both DA receptor subtypes are restricted to the dorsal part of the hippocampus.", 
    "77": "The mesolimbocortical dopaminergic system innervates several brain regions including the frontal cortex. The aim of our work was both to identify and to pharmacologically characterize the dopamine receptors located in this brain area. We found that different selective agonists for D1 receptors were able to increase adenylate cyclase activity, and these effects were antagonized by haloperidol and SCH 23390. Moreover different agonists for D2 receptors inhibited the cyclic AMP generating system, and these effects were prevented by (-)-sulpiride. According to the paradigm that D1 receptors are linked with adenylate cyclase in a stimulatory way, while D2 receptors are linked with the same enzyme in an inhibitory way, our results indicate the presence of both D1 and D2 receptors in rat frontal cortex.",

    "79": "The vasodilatory effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid methylprednisolone was studied in the vascular bed of the isolated hind limb of the dog. The isolated hind limb was perfused with the animal's blood by means of a roller pump at a flow to maintain a constant control pressure. The effects on hind limb pressure of alpha- and beta-agonists, sodium nitroprusside, and methylprednisolone sodium succinate were observed in unblocked (Group I) as well as in alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocked (Group II) animals. The agonists epinephrine (2 micrograms) and isoproterenol (0.5 micrograms) caused significant increases (+45%) and decreases (-43%) in hind limb pressure, respectively, and both sodium nitroprusside (100-200 micrograms) and methylprednisolone (500 mg) caused significant decreases in hind limb pressure of unblocked animals. In animals with adrenoceptors blocked by phenoxybenzamine and propranolol (Group II) the agonists produced no significant effects, but the methylprednisolone and sodium nitroprusside caused significant decreases in pressure, 45% and 28%, respectively. Following vasodilatation by methylprednisolone, sodium nitroprusside caused a slight, but not significant decrease in hind limb pressure. These data show that methylprednisolone will produce significant vasodilatation even in the presence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, indicating that adrenoceptors alone cannot account for the vasodilatory actions of the steroid in the isolated hind limb."
