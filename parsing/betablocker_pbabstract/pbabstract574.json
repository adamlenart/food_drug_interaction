    "0": "Three patients severely disabled from postural hypotension were treated with xamoterol, a selective beta-1-adrenoceptor antagonist with a high degree of partial agonist activity. Oral treatment (200 mg b.i.d.) was chosen on the basis of the effects of acute intravenous administration of xamoterol and pindolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. In these patients pindolol had a predominantly antagonist effect, whereas xamoterol had a predominantly agonist effect after intravenous administration. Oral treatment was carried out with placebo control in a single-blind fashion. The patients reported gradual improvement during the first days of treatment. After 1 month of oral treatment, heart rate had increased by 15 beats/min, systolic blood pressure from 131 to 170 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure from 77 to 91 mmHg and mean blood pressure by 22 mmHg (mean values, supine). During the placebo period (2 weeks) heart rate decreased to pretreatment levels and mean blood pressure was reduced by only 14 mmHg. The patients reported substantial improvement in their condition during active medication. Xamoterol seems to be a useful alternative in the treatment of postural hypotension.", 
    "1": "Twenty patients on chronic beta-blockade for angina pectoris were included in a double-blind randomized cross-over placebo-controlled study on a 2% nitroglycerin gel administered transdermally by an adhesive. Topinitro. The dose, 2.5-10 mg/day, was individually titrated and each treatment period was 28 days. The effect was evaluated by exercise tests and diary cards for anginal attacks and nitroglycerin tablets consumed. Results. In the 17 patients who completed the trial, active treatment did not influence systolic and diastolic blood pressure or resting and maximal heart rate. Maximal performance increased insignificantly from 92 +/- 23 to 96 +/- 20 W. The level at which 1 mm of ST depression appeared increased from 62 +/- 26 to 73 +/- 28 W (p less than 0.05). The number of attacks decreased significantly, from 92 +/- 30 to 14 +/- 28/4 weeks. The reduction in the number of sublingual nitroglycerin tablets consumed was insignificant. Conclusion. Nitroglycerin adhesive, in individual dosages, may improve signs and symptoms of ischemia.", 
    "2": "Drugs selective for either the beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptor have been investigated for their effects on the head-twitch behaviour induced by L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) in mice. All four agonists, dobutamine and prenalterol (beta 1-), and salbutamol and procaterol (beta 2-), potentiated the effect of L-5-HTP although they were ineffective in inducing the head-twitch when administered alone. The corresponding antagonists, practolol and metoprolol (beta 1-) and butoxamine and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-), were without effect on the L-5-HTP head-twitch. The antagonists each significantly reduced the effect of the corresponding agonists but, while butoxamine and ICI 118,551 were inactive against dobutamine and prenalterol potentiation, both practolol and metoprolol reduced the effect of salbutamol and procaterol. Thus it is argued that dobutamine and prenalterol potentiation is due to an action at beta 1-adrenoceptors, while at least a component of the potentiating effect of salbutamol and procaterol is exerted through beta 2-adrenoceptors. The lack of effect of the antagonists alone is discussed.", 
    "3": "The involvement of noradrenaline in the potentiation of head-twitching by drugs acting at GABA and related receptors has been examined in mice. The direct 5-HT agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine was used to induce the head-twitch. The dopamine beta-oxidase inhibitor FLA-63 depleted whole brain noradrenaline by 90% and potentiated head-twitching when this was measured 4 h after injection. The GABAA-receptor agonists muscimol and 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (3-APS), a low dose of pentobarbitone, diazepam and picrotoxin (PTX) potentiated control head-twitch rates but had no further effect when head-twitching had been potentiated by FLA-63. The potentiating action of FLA-63 was prevented by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol; the latter having no effect on control head-twitch rates. Muscimol and diazepam potentiation was examined and found to be blocked by metoprolol. The GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen reduced head-twitching. This was also prevented by FLA-63. The role of beta-adrenoceptors in modulating these actions of GABA-related drugs is discussed.", 
    "4": "The results of this continuing multicenter study revealed a good efficacy and tolerance of Metipranolol used in patients with ocular hypertension and chronic open-angle glaucoma. After 4 weeks' treatment a reduction in average intraocular pressure of 5.6 mmHg could be observed. This favorable effect on pressure values could be confirmed during long-term treatment up to 16 weeks (average reduction in intraocular pressure of 5.9 mmHg equal to 25%). More than 90% of patients treated with 0.1% Metipranolol showed very good or good tolerance. In conclusion, it can be established that 0.1% Metipranolol has also confirmed its value in daily practice and offers an interesting possibility for low-dosage beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "5": "This study was performed to determine the contributions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to cardiovascular control. Hexamethonium was administered to block the autonomic ganglia, propranolol to block beta adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system, and methylatropine to block the parasympathetic nervous system. The results of this study indicate high sympathetic tone and low parasympathetic tone in resting Macaca fascicularis. These findings are different from those in man but are similar to other nonhuman primates.", 
    "6": "Electrical and mechanical properties of smooth muscle cells and of neuro-effector transmission in the smooth muscle layer of the dog bronchiole (about 1 mm in diameter) were studied with double-sucrose-gap, micro-electrode or tension recording methods. Electrical field stimulation of short duration (50 microseconds) applied to the whole tissue excited the intrinsic nerves, and evoked excitatory junction potentials (e.j.p.s) followed by a twitch-like tension; these were abolished by tetrodotoxin (10(-7) M) or by atropine (10(-6) M). 5-Hydroxytryptamine (10(-5) M) produced a tonic contracture of the bronchiole, and electrical field stimulation applied during the tonic contracture produced an initial phasic contraction and a subsequent relaxation. Atropine (10(-6) M) and propranolol (10(-6) M) selectively abolished the phasic contraction and relaxation, respectively, indicating that dog bronchiolar muscles are innervated by excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory adrenergic nerve fibres. E.j.p.s and twitch contractions evoked by electrical field stimulation at 3 min intervals showed a gradual reduction in amplitude during superfusion with normal Krebs solution, and this reduction was overcome by pre-treatment with indomethacin (10(-5) M). The mean value of the resting membrane potential of the bronchiole smooth muscle cells was -70.2 +/- 2.2 mV (+/- S.D., n = 150), and an action potential was superimposed on e.j.p.s in 50% of the muscle cells examined when the amplitude of e.j.p.s exceeded 35 mV. During repetitive field stimulation at 0.1-0.2 Hz, the amplitude of the e.j.p.s gradually increased (facilitation); this phenomenon was markedly enhanced by indomethacin (10(-5) M) and was depressed by exogenously applied prostaglandins in low concentrations (10(-11)-10(-8) M). Histamine (5 X 10(-8)-5 X 10(-7) M) enhanced the amplitude of e.j.p.s and twitch contraction evoked by field stimulation, and this effect was antagonized by mepyramine (10(-7) M). Histamine (10(-7) M) enhanced the amplitude of the ACh-induced contraction when a relatively low concentration (10(-7) M) of ACh was applied, but not when concentrations of 10(-6) M- or 10(-5) M-ACh were applied. Histamine had no effects on the facilitation of e.j.p. Bronchiolar smooth muscle cells therefore showed larger resting potentials and a greater tendency to fire action potentials than trachealis muscle, and prostaglandins and histamine are involved in inhibitory and accelerative mechanisms related to excitatory neuro-effector transmission, respectively.", 
    "7": "The synthesis of the thiophenic analogue of metoprolol (VI) and of its related compound (VII) are described. Except for cardioselectivity at low doses, the thiophenic analogue of metoprolol behaves in a very similar way as this compound in all the aspects considered in a preliminary pharmacological study.", 
    "8": "The short-term efficacy of nitrendipine (N) as a first stage antihypertensive drug in black patients has been assessed and compared with acebutolol (A) in a double-blind study. Forty patients were randomized and after a 4 week run-in period on placebo, the active treatment was administered for 6 weeks starting with 20 mg N or 200 mg A once daily. The dose was increased up to 60 mg N or 600 mg A as needed. Nitrendipine appeared to be more efficient than acebutolol in reducing blood pressure and the N-induced fall in blood pressure was achieved after 2 weeks. After 2 and 6 weeks on N, the recumbent blood pressure was decreased by 13% and 12% for the systolic and by 14% and 11% for the diastolic pressure. The concurrent decreases in the A group averaged 4% and 5% for the systolic and 5% and 10% for the diastolic pressure after 2 and 6 weeks. Pulse rate and plasma renin activity in the N group were slightly increased and body weight was decreased at the end of the active treatment period.", 
    "9": "Bisoprolol is a new beta 1-selective beta-blocking agent with a plasma half-time of 10-12 h and without partial agonist properties. Forty-eight patients with essential hypertension were randomly treated with 5, 10, or 20 mg bisoprolol given once daily for 8 weeks. All measurements were made 24 hours after the last dose. Bisoprolol had antihypertensive and beta-blocking properties both at rest and during exercise. The 20 mg dosage regimen was more effective than that of 5 mg and 10 mg. The drug was well tolerated and all the 48 patients completed the trial.", 
    "10": "The mechanism regulating the movements of the unique motile iridophores of the blue damselfish, Chyrsiptera cyanea, was studied. The reaction in which the cells become reflective to light rays of longer wavelength, i.e. from the near u.v. region to the green region, was designated as the \"coloring response\", while the reverse process was labeled the \"clearing response\". Both nervous stimuli and adrenergic agonists gave rise to the coloring response, which could be antagonized by alpha adrenolytic agents. The clearing response was accelerated by adenosine and inhibited by theophylline. None of the hormonal substances tested had any effect on the motile response of the cells. It was concluded that the motile iridophores are solely under the control of the sympathetic adrenergic system, and that the co-transmitter, adenosine, may function to antagonize quickly the true transmitter-induced colored state of the cells.", 
    "11": "Beta-adrenergic blockade by quite large doses of propranolol, practolol and oxprenolol, once or continuously applied, does not influence jejunal crypt-cell proliferation in the rat. After a single i.p. injection of 20 mg/kg propranolol or practolol and even of 100 mg/kg practolol, the mitotic index, the labelling index and the duration of the S phase do not differ between treated and untreated control animals nor between animals treated with the different drugs. Continuous application of 30 mg/kg/d propranolol, practolol or oxprenolol for 7 or 14 days does not affect the mitotic and labelling indices either, nor does it change the duration of the cycle of the jejunal crypt cells and its phases as determined by the percent labelled mitoses method. These results are in contrast to those reported previously by Tutton & Helme (1974).", 
    "12": "In unanesthetized cats the emetic action of dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) was investigated, after it was injected into the cerebral ventricles through chronically implanted cannulae. DMPP injected in 0.2-2.0 mg doses into the cerebral ventricle produced dose-dependent vomiting, which was abolished after ablation of area postrema. However, copper sulfate given intragastrically evoked vomiting in cats with an ablated area postrema. Further, the emetic response to ICV DMPP and to intragastric copper sulfate was depressed or abolished in cats pretreated with ICV reserpine. The emetic response to ICV DMPP, but not that caused by intragastric copper sulfate, was potentiated in cats pretreated with ICV 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine. Ganglionic blocking agents, mecamylamine and hexamethonium, injected ICV prevented the vomiting elicited by ICV DMPP. On the other hand, selected anti-muscarinic drugs, alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists, dopamine antagonists, antihistamines and a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonist all injected into the cerebral ventricles had virtually no effect on the vomiting induced by DMPP. It is postulated that DMPP evokes vomiting by its action on nicotinic receptors of nerve cells within the area postrema but not on catecholaminergic, serotonergic, or cholinergic receptors. Finally, 5-HT and acetylcholine could also be involved in the inhibition of the complex mechanisms underlying the central regulation of vomiting.", 
    "13": "The effect of forskolin and several H2-agonists was investigated on the activity of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of guinea-pig lung parenchyma. Histamine, 0.1 microM to 1 mM, dimaprit, 1 microM to 10 mM, 4-methyl histamine, 0.1 microM to 10 mM, impromidine, 10 nM to 10 microM and forskolin, 1 nM to 100 microM, all produced a dose-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity above the basal level. The histamine H1-receptor antagonist mepyramine, 10 microM, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, 10 microM, had no effect on the stimulation by histamine of adenylate cyclase. The dose-response curve for stimulation by histamine of adenylate cyclase was shifted to the right in a dose-dependent manner by increasing concentrations of several H2-antagonists. Schild plots constructed for each H2-antagonist produced straight lines with slopes not significantly different from unity. The equilibrium dissociation constants obtained for the H2-antagonists in this study were similar to those previously reported for inhibition of dimaprit-induced relaxation of the pre-contracted lung strip, inhibition of [3H]-tiotidine binding to homogenates of guinea-pig lung parenchyma and inhibition of histamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in guinea-pig gastric mucosa.", 
    "14": "The role of catecholamines in the production of ischaemia-induced ventricular arrhythmias in vivo and in vitro was studied using coronary artery ligation in the rat. Increases in plasma catecholamine concentrations during coronary artery ligation in pentobarbitone-anaesthetized animals were prevented by either acute adrenalectomy or chronic adrenal demedullation, but these procedures did not protect against the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Thus plasma catecholamines were not obligatory mediators of arrhythmogenesis. Three protocols were used in vitro to evaluate the possible influence of intramyocardial release of noradrenaline, produced by the local conditions of ischaemia, on the production of ventricular arrhythmias. During coronary artery ligation in isolated perfused hearts, no enhanced output of 3H could be detected from [3H]-noradrenaline loaded hearts, even in the presence of inhibitors of catecholamine uptake processes, although washout of lactate from ischaemic regions was readily demonstrable. Both optical isomers of propranolol were equally effective in reducing the incidence of arrhythmias, implying a non-specific effect, since the (+)-isomer possesses considerably less beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. The equipotency of optical isomers of propranolol combined with a lack of effect of atenolol suggested that arrhythmia production was not a consequence of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. The alpha-adrenoceptor blockers phentolamine and prazosin, both exerted antiarrhythmic actions of similar potency, but phenoxybenzamine and trimazosin had no significant effects. An evaluation of the pharmacological properties of the alpha-adrenoceptor blockers showed that those drugs which had demonstrable local anaesthetic properties also exerted significant antiarrhythmic effects. No relationship was found between potency of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and antiarrhythmic efficacy. The overall conclusion from these multifaceted approaches was that catecholamines were not necessary mediators of the early phase of ventricular arrhythmias in the rat.", 
    "15": "The effect of local anesthetics on the stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was studied using Tetrahymena microsomal preparation. Dibucaine, tetracaine, and propranolol, a beta-blocking agent, nonspecifically inhibited the activities of NADPH-ferrihemoprotein reductase as well as of stearoyl-CoA desaturase and the terminal component, but lidocaine and procaine had no effect on these activities. The inhibitory potency was decreased in the order of dibucaine greater than propranolol greater than tetracaine much greater than lidocaine = procaine. According to the double-reciprocal plots of stearoyl-CoA desaturase, the inhibition by dibucaine appeared to be noncompetitive with respect to stearoyl-CoA as substrate. However, the activity of NADH-ferricyanide reductase was not significantly affected by concentrations of propranolol and tetracaine lower than 10mM, but by dibucaine. The terminal component, cyanide-sensitive factor, was most sensitive to local anesthetics among the microsomal electron transport components, suggesting a rate-limiting enzyme.", 
    "16": "Hemodynamic effects of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, were investigated in the conscious dog and in the anesthetized open-chest dog. In the conscious dog, intravenous injection of labetalol, in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, decreased the total peripheral resistance by approximately 20% (P less than 0.01) in association with falls in blood pressure and heart rate. The total peripheral resistance of the anesthetized open-chest dog was not affected by labetalol in the presence of the same extent of blood pressure fall as results of the conscious dog. In contrast, agents which have beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect alone provided substantial elevation of the total peripheral resistance in the anesthetized dog. These results indicate that the different responses of the resistance to labetalol probably result from the vascular alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action, and also show that in the conscious state alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action of labetalol is enhanced in comparison with the effect in the anesthetized open-chest dog.", 
    "17": "The hemodynamic responses to 3 different therapeutical regimens: beta-adrenoceptor blockade, calcium inflow inhibition and combined alpha-beta-blockade were evaluated in 3 matched randomized groups of patients with ischemic heart disease and typical exercise-induced angina. The groups consisted of 22, 16 and 15 men, mean age 55-59 years. They were studied at rest and during ischemia-inducing exercise, before and after single oral doses of 100 mg metoprolol, 10 mg nifedipine and 200 mg labetalol. Pressures in the brachial artery and the pulmonary circulation were recorded by means of percutaneously introduced catheters. Cardiac output was determined according to the Fick principle. Metoprolol reduced mean arterial pressures, heart rate and cardiac output. Systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressure increased. Nifedipine resulted under all conditions in a distinct reduction of systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressures and a slight increase in heart rate and cardiac output. Left ventricular filling pressure was significantly lowered, the more the higher the initial level. The effect of labetalol was similar to that of nifedipine; however, cardiac output was unchanged and heart rate was slightly reduced. Left ventricular filling pressure was significantly lower. It is apparent that suppression of adrenergic stimulation by beta-receptor blockade alone may have adverse hemodynamic effects in ischemic heart disease and prompt further functional deterioration. Conversely, both calcium and combined alpha-beta-receptor blockade tend to improve left ventricular function by lowering both left ventricular preload and total systemic vascular resistance. The results strongly suggest that in patients in whom beta-receptor blockers appear indicated, their adverse hemodynamic effects can be offset by concomitant alpha1-receptor blockade or vasodilation without losing symptomatic efficacy. Combined alpha-beta-receptor blockade has the advantage over calcium antagonists alone to prevent any increase in adrenergic activity and related hyperkinetic response.", 
    "18": "The distribution into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of five 3H- or 14C-labelled beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs given intravenously was studied in urethane-anaesthetized rats. The doses (mg/kg) were: alprenolol 5, metoprolol 1, oxprenolol 5, pindolol 0.5, propranolol 0.1 and 5. Within 15 min. a marked fraction of the given radioactivity appeared in CSF with all substances. During the follow-up period of 315 min., only propranolol, independently of dose, caused high CSF/plasma ratios (0.54-0.73) of radioactivity. The other four beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs caused levels of CSF radioactivity which were 0.05-0.28 of that in plasma and 0.05-0.14 of the calculated levels of activity in the whole body. Since propranolol is bound to plasma proteins to a higher degree than the other drugs studied, the penetration of the unbound fraction of propranolol into rat CSF is even more pronounced than what would be expected on the basis of CSF/plasma ratio measured.", 
    "19": "In Experiment I, two groups of rats were rewarded for lever-pressing under RI 64. During signalled 3-min intrusion periods shocks were delivered response-contingently (on RI 64) for the Punishment group and non-contingently (on RT 64) for the Conditioned Suppression group. d,l-Propranolol (2, 5 mg/kg) released intrusion responding to a similar extent in the two groups. Experiment II comprised two distinct experiments: two groups of rats were trained in parallel on signalled multiple schedules in which responding during the baseline component was rewarded on RI 20. For the second component responding was extinguished in Experiment IIa; it continued to be rewarded but was also punished by electric shock in Experiment IIb. Shock levels were adjusted individually so as to produce similar levels of response suppression in these two groups. d,l-Propranolol released non-rewarded responding (2-5 mg/kg; Expt IIa) but had no effect on punishment (2-10 mg/kg; Expt IIb). l-Propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) but not d-propranolol (2.5 mg/kg) also released non-rewarded responding in Expt IIa. In a further trial d,l-propranolol (5 mg/kg) released punished responding in Expt IIb in a group of animals in which response suppression had been partially relieved by reducing shock intensity. It is hypothesized that beta-adrenergic stimuli may influence response suppression to the extent that the unconditioned aversive event causing suppression is not salient.", 
    "20": "The urinary excretion patterns of esmolol, a short-acting beta blocker, and its major metabolite were investigated in eight healthy men after intravenous infusion of 50, 100, 200, and 300 micrograms/kg/min of esmolol for six hours and 150 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours. Esmolol and the metabolite concentrations in urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean urinary recoveries of the unchanged drug were 0.64%, 0.67%, 0.69%, 0.77%, and 0.98% after the 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 micrograms/kg/min dose, respectively. Recovery of the metabolite was independent of dose, and the overall mean recovery accounted for 73% of administered dose. The results of this study indicate that esmolol is extensively metabolized, and the extent of the metabolism is not dose related in the dosage range used. The renal route plays a very minor role in the elimination of the drug but is important for the elimination of the metabolite.", 
    "21": "The pharmacodynamics of beta blockade with single oral doses of celiprolol 200 and 400 mg, compared with placebo, atenolol 50 and 100 mg, propranolol 80 and 160 mg, metoprolol 100 and 200 mg, and pindolol 5 and 10 mg, were evaluated in an open, incomplete-block study design employing 11 healthy male volunteers. Each subject received five of the 11 possible treatments at weekly intervals. The maximal rate-pressure product (RPP) induced by standardized treadmill exercise was measured 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours after each treatment. During the course of the exercise test, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were recorded at one-minute intervals for five minutes. The maximal RPP, heart rate, and the maximum change from baseline were calculated for each exercise period. The data were analyzed using absolute reduction and percentage reduction of these parameters. All of the beta blockers tested produced significant decreases (P less than .05) in the exercise RPP, ranging from 16% reduction for celiprolol 200 mg to 47% reduction for propranolol 160 mg at peak response. Celiprolol 400 mg reduced the RPP by 31% at peak effect and did not differ significantly from the other treatments. Celiprolol 400 mg and atenolol 100 mg were the only agents that significantly reduced the RPP 24 hours posttreatment (20.7% and 21.7%, respectively) compared with placebo. Celiprolol 400 mg was the only agent to significantly reduce exercise heart rate 24 hours posttreatment (26.6 beats, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Wide variability in response to some drugs such as debrisoquine can be attributed largely to genetic polymorphism of their oxidative metabolism. Most beta-blockers undergo extensive oxidation. Anecdotal reports of high plasma concentrations of certain beta-blockers in poor metabolisers (PMs) of debrisoquine have claimed that the oxidation of these drugs is under polymorphic control. Subsequently, controlled studies have shown that debrisoquine oxidation phenotype is a major determinant of the metabolism, pharmacokinetics and some of the pharmacological actions of metoprolol, bufuralol, timolol and bopindolol. The poor metaboliser phenotype is associated with increased plasma drug concentrations, a prolongation of elimination half-life and more intense and sustained beta-blockade. Phenotypic differences have also been observed in the pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers of metoprolol and bufuralol. In vivo and in vitro studies have identified some of the metabolic pathways which are subject to the defect, viz. alpha-hydroxylation and O-demethylation of metoprolol and 1'- and possibly 4- and 6-hydroxylation of bufuralol. In contrast, the overall pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol, which is also extensively oxidised, are not related to debrisoquine polymorphism, although 4'-hydroxypropranolol formation is lower in poor metabolisers. As anticipated, the disposition of atenolol which is eliminated predominantly unchanged by the kidney and in the faeces, is unrelated to debrisoquine phenotype. The clinical significance of impaired elimination of beta-blockers is not clear. If standard doses of beta-blockers are used in poor metabolisers, these subjects may be susceptible to concentration-related adverse reactions and they may also require less frequent dosing for control of angina pectoris.", 
    "23": "A blind randomised cross-over study was conducted on 10 patients (20 eyes) to compare the effect in patients with open-angle glaucoma of metipranolol 0.3% with that of timolol 0.25% on intraocular pressure following one month's topical instillation with each preparation alone. There was no statistically significant difference in intraocular pressure reduction between these two preparations, and the ocular tolerance of both was good. There was no significant difference in the blood pressure, pulse, or pupil diameters of patients receiving either preparation.", 
    "24": "Bopindolol, an esterified beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, was administered to nine healthy male volunteers in oral (1 mg and 4 mg) and intravenous (1 mg) doses. Plasma concentrations determined using a radio-receptor assay (RRA) and high pressure liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c.) yielded almost identical results, indicating that hydrolysed bopindolol, the major metabolite, is responsible for the pharmacological activity of the drug. After intravenous administration the half-life for the formation of the hydrolysis product was about 0.3 h. The elimination of hydrolysed bopindolol from the plasma, determined with a one-compartment model occurred with a half-life of about 4 h. There were indications for a longer beta phase of elimination with a half-life of about 8 h, which, owing to the relative insensitivity of the method for concentrations present after more than 24 h, could not be determined exactly. The absolute bioavailability of the active compound is about 70%. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was determined as the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia. With oral doses the maximum effect was reached after 3 h (-29 beats min-1 after 1 mg, -40 beats min-1 after 4 mg). After intravenous administration most of the effect was present after 0.5 h but the maximum effect (-33 beats min-1) was only reached at 3 h. Bopindolol possesses a long duration of action: after 48 h 33% of the maximum effect of the oral dose of 4 mg was still present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "We measured the electrophysiologic effects of flestolol, an ultra short-acting beta blocker, in 15 patients at two infusion rates: a 45 micrograms/kg loading dose followed by a 5 micrograms/kg/min infusion and a 60 micrograms/kg loading dose followed by a 10 micrograms/kg/min infusion. Electrophysiologic measurements were made after 15 minutes at each infusion rate (plasma concentrations 46 +/- 11 and 94 +/- 23 ng/ml). Flestolol produced dose-dependent effects on the sinus node, the atrioventricular (AV) node, and right ventricular refractoriness, whereas atrial refractoriness and infranodal conduction were unchanged. At the 10 micrograms/kg/min dose, flestolol prolonged sinus cycle length by a mean of 20% (p = 0.0001), corrected sinus node recovery time by 42% (p = 0.02), AH interval by 21% (p = 0.0001), AV node effective refractory period by 28%, AV node Wenckebach cycle length by 30% (0.0001), and right ventricular effective refractory period by 5% (p = 0.03). A significant concentration-effect relationship (p less than or equal to 0.03) was present for all variables which had significant dose-effect relationships. No patient developed hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, or other toxicity. Sinus cycle length decreased linearly with time in the post infusion period (r = 0.99); by 30 minutes post infusion, measured electrophysiologic variables had returned to control values and flestolol plasma concentration had decreased to 4 +/- 2 ng/ml. Flestolol's electrophysiologic effects are similar to those of other beta blockers. In doses up to 10 micrograms/kg/min, it is safe in selected patients, has rapid onset and offset of action, and does not cause acute rebound.", 
    "26": "The efficacy and safety of esmolol, a short-acting intravenous beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, and placebo were compared in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (heart rate greater than 120 bpm) in a multicenter, double-blind, partial-crossover study. Seventy-one patients were randomized to receive either esmolol (n = 36) or placebo (n = 35) as initial treatment. Therapeutic failures were crossed over to the other study medication. Therapeutic response was defined as greater than or equal to 20% reduction in heart rate, heart rate less than 100 bpm, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm. The therapeutic response to esmolol during the initial treatment period (72%) was similar to that obtained when esmolol was given as a second agent. The average esmolol dosage producing a therapeutic response was 97.5 micrograms/kg/min. Four patients (6%) converted to normal sinus rhythm during esmolol infusion. In the majority of patients (80%), therapeutic response was lost within 30 minutes following discontinuation of esmolol infusion, a finding indicative of rapid reversal of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The most prevalent adverse effect during esmolol infusion was hypotension which occurred in eight patients (12%). Hypotension and associated symptoms resolved within 30 minutes after discontinuation of esmolol infusion, which is consistent with the short duration of action of esmolol (elimination half-life of 9.2 minutes).",

Kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, were defined and the apparent first-order rate constant (Vmax/Km) was derived. On the basis of the apparent first-order rate constant, rimiterol was found to be a 1.5-fold and dobutamine a 5-fold better substrate for catechol-O-methyltransferase than isoprenaline; isoetharine shows no improvement over isoprenaline. Nadolol is not a substrate for catechol-O-methyltransferase. O-Methylation of isoprenaline- and noradrenaline-enantiomers was found to be stereoselective: catechol-O-methyltransferase shows selectivity towards the laevo (-) isomer with respect to the (+) form or racemic mixture. The investigation indicated stereochemical and steric determinants important in the interaction of catechol-O-methyltransferase with physiologically and clinically important beta-adrenoceptor agents.", 
    "28": "The blood lactate response to exercise has interested physiologists for over fifty years, but has more recently become as routine a variable to measure in many exercise laboratories as is heart rate. This rising popularity is probably due to: the ease of sampling and improved accuracy afforded by recently developed micro-assay methods and/or automated lactate analysers; and the predictive and evaluative power associated with the lactate response to exercise. Several studies suggest that the strong relationship between exercise performance and lactate-related variables can be attributed to a reflection by lactate during exercise of not only the functional capacity of the central circulatory apparati to transport oxygen to exercising muscles, but also the peripheral capacity of the musculature to utilise this oxygen. For example, several studies contrast the relationship between VO2max and endurance running performance with that between a lactate variable and the same running performance. In every study, the lactate variable is more highly correlated with performance. Similarly, prescribing training intensity as a function of the lactate concentration elicited by the training may prove to be a means of obtaining a more homogeneous adaptation to training in a group of athletes or subjects than is obtained by setting intensity as a function of maximal heart rate or % VO2max. A review of the recent literature shows that the lactate response to supramaximal exercise is a sensitive indicator of adaptation to 'sprint training' and is correlated with supramaximal exercise performance. This review also describes the possible applications of lactate measurements to enhance the rate of recovery from high intensity exercise. Although the lactate response to exercise is reproducible under standardised conditions it can be influenced by the site of blood sampling, ambient temperature, changes in the body's acid-base balance prior to exercise, prior exercise, dietary manipulations, or pharmacological interpretation.", 
    "29": "The threshold of seizures induced by electroconvulsive shock (ECS) was determined in mice and the effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (yohimbine, rauwolscine, idazoxan), alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists (clonidine, B-HT 920), serotonin antagonists (methysergide, metergoline) and a serotonin agonist (quipazine) were studied. The interaction of yohimbine with clonidine, methysergide, metergoline and quipazine was also examined. It was found that yohimbine and rauwolscine elevated the seizure threshold, while idazoxan was ineffective. Clonidine and B-HT 920 were also ineffective, but quipazine elevated the seizure threshold. Methysergide and metergoline did not change the seizure threshold alone, but both of them antagonized the anticonvulsant effect of yohimbine. Clonidine failed to antagonize yohimbine's effects. Quipazine potentiated yohimbine's action. These results suggest that, in mice, the protective effect of yohimbine against ECS-induced seizures may be mediated via serotonin receptors and not via alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "30": "Two experiments were conducted to explore the effects of chronic antidepressant treatment on endogenous opioid systems. In the first study, mice received desipramine for 21 days, a regimen which down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors [13]. Subsequently, hotplate jump latencies were measured after acute saline, morphine or naloxone, to test for dynamic changes in endogenous opioid systems. Chronic desipramine treatment resulted in a significant attenuation of morphine analgesia, but had no effect on latencies of saline and naloxone treated mice. In the second experiment, naltrexone or propranolol were given with desipramine for 21 days, in an attempt to block the development of subsensitivity to morphine. Naltrexone had no effect on desipramine attenuation of morphine analgesia. Propranolol given with desipramine slightly lowered jump latencies of acute saline controls, resulting in a significant analgetic effect of morphine. These data suggest that attenuation of morphine analgesia by chronic desipramine treatment may be mediated by actions on noradrenergic systems, rather than direct effects on opioid receptors.", 
    "31": "We have examined the metabolism of beta-adrenergic receptors in intact S49 lymphoma cells. Centrifugal elutriation was used to prepare synchronized cells enriched in particular phases of the cell division cycle. In these synchronized cells, the rate of appearance of beta-adrenergic receptors (i.e., [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites) was continuous, approximately 75 sites/cell/hr, and receptor number per cell increased in proportion to the increase in cell size. Thus, receptor number, normalized for cell size, remains constant throughout the cell cycle. Receptors on cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle displayed similar affinities for the radiolabeled antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol and apparent affinities for the agonist isoproterenol. We examined rates of receptor turnover in asynchronous cells by following receptor recovery after inactivation of beta-adrenergic receptors with bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM), an irreversible beta-adrenergic antagonist. The beta-adrenergic receptors on S49 cells demonstrated an average \"half-life\" of 28-30 hr. Since the population doubling time for S49 cells is 16-17 hr, this would indicate that receptor protein is conserved through successive cell generations. Moreover, receptor reappearance after blockade by BAAM was a function of newly appearing receptors during the S49 cell cycle and not loss of BAAM from receptors. The rate of receptor metabolism indicates that, under basal conditions (i.e., in the absence of agonist), beta-adrenergic receptors on S49 cells are metabolized more slowly than are other classes of receptors that bind peptides and cholinergic agonists in several other cell types.", 
    "32": "We determined in anesthetized sheep whether isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, prevents the increases in pulmonary fluid and protein exchange produced by thrombin-induced intravascular coagulation. Seven sheep were infused intravenously with 0.05 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1 isoproterenol before infusion of alpha-thrombin, and six sheep were infused with alpha-thrombin only and served as control subjects. The marked increases in pulmonary lymph flow and lymph protein clearance in the control thrombin group were attenuated (P less than 0.05) in the isoproterenol group in association with a higher pulmonary blood flow (P less than 0.05) and a lower pulmonary vascular resistance (P less than 0.05) in the isoproterenol group and with similar increases in pulmonary arterial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressures in both groups. The decreases in fluid and protein fluxes produced by isoproterenol are related to its beta-adrenergic properties because propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocked the protective effects of isoproterenol in a second group of sheep infused with propranolol, isoproterenol, and thrombin. Raising left atrial pressure to test for changes in vascular permeability increased protein flux to a much greater extent in the thrombin control group than in the isoproterenol group challenged with thrombin. The data suggest that isoproterenol attenuated the increase in fluid and protein fluxes produced by thrombin-induced intravascular coagulation by a permeability-decreasing mechanism.", 
    "33": "We studied the simultaneous alpha- and beta-adrenergic response characteristics of canine tracheal smooth muscle in 398 strips from 67 dogs in vitro. Experiments were performed to determine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the expression of the alpha-adrenoceptor contractile responses elicited by norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PE), and clonidine (CLO). Maximal active tension caused by NE increased from 39.1 +/- 27.0 to 241 +/- 75.0 g/cm2 as the concentration of propranolol (PROP) was increased from 10(-6) to 10(-4) M. Augmentation of tracheal smooth muscle contraction caused by PE and CLO was also observed with progressive beta-adrenoceptor blockade; contraction to NE, PE, and CLO was blocked selectively with 3 X 10(-5) M phentolamine (PA) and phenoxybenzamine (PBZ). The beta-adrenergic relaxing properties of the same three agonists were also studied. After alpha-adrenergic blockade with PA or PBZ, all three agonists caused relaxation (NE greater than CLO greater than PE) of methacholine-induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle that was reversed selectively with PROP. We demonstrate that NE, PE, and CLO cause simultaneous stimulation of both the alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in tracheal smooth muscle; the net response elicited is the result of adrenergic physiological antagonism and depends on the relative degree of alpha- and/or beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "34": "Of recent interest is the acute use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in patients who have suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Acute use of beta-blockers refers to initiation of therapy within hours following the onset of symptoms suggestive of AMI. The proposed goal of therapy is to alter the infarction process to improve mortality. Because of the hyperadrenergic activity present in patients during an infarction, beta-blockers are theoretically an attractive therapeutic intervention because of their sympatholytic properties. Acute use of beta-blockers has been shown to limit infarct size, as determined by cardiac enzyme activity, and reduce the incidence of major ventricular arrhythmias. Beta-blockers may also prevent infarction in patients with symptoms suggestive of infarction. However, the acute use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents has not been shown to reduce short-term (less than or equal to 30 d) mortality. In view of this fact, the acute use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents cannot be recommended.", 
    "35": "When a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires medical therapy for systemic hypertension, a number of special considerations may affect the choice of antihypertensive drug and subsequent management. Thiazide diuretics have no adverse effect on airway function and are the agents of choice for initial therapy. beta-Antagonists are usually considered first-line agents in antihypertensive therapy, but even relatively cardioselective ones may increase airway resistance in patients with obstructive lung diseases, and they should be used with caution, if at all, in such patients. Although potassium-wasting diuretics are the preferred agents for treating hypertension in patients with COPD, they may worsen carbon dioxide retention in hypoventilating patients and potentiate hypokalemia in those receiving corticosteroids. In addition, beta-agonists may substantially lower serum potassium levels in patients already rendered hypokalemic by diuretics. Patients with COPD receiving potassium-wasting diuretics who have chronic respiratory acidosis or are receiving corticosteroids or beta-agonists should undergo close monitoring of electrolyte levels and be considered for therapy with potassium supplements or, preferably, potassium-sparing agents.", 
    "36": "Halothane, in anesthetic concentrations (0.6-1.8 volumes/100 ml), produced a dose-dependent decrease in myocardial cyclic AMP (cAMP) content and an increase in cyclic GMP (cGMP) content in mice exposed to a continuous flow of the anesthetic carried in air for 15 min. Atropine (up to 20 mg/kg i.p.) did not alter significantly the myocardial cyclic nucleotides content or the effect of halothane on cAMP and cGMP content. Prazosin and yohimbine had no significant effect on cAMP or cGMP content in the absence of halothane. Both alpha adrenergic antagonists inhibited the halothane-induced increase in cGMP content (ID50, 0.24 and 0.54 mumol/kg i.p. for prazosin and yohimbine, respectively). In contrast, the decrease in cAMP content induced by halothane was not altered by alpha adrenergic antagonists. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.p.) diminished myocardial cAMP level and prevented the halothane effect on myocardial cAMP content. Pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine did not change the cGMP response to halothane. Thus, the action of halothane on myocardial cyclic nucleotides content appears to be predominantly a peripheral effect, not related to cellular mechanisms mediated by muscarinic receptors. The results suggest that the increase in cGMP content induced by halothane does not require intact adrenergic nerve endings and that cellular processes associated with the alpha adrenoceptor system may be involved; the decrease in cAMP content may be due to an inhibition of the beta stimulatory action of catecholamines on adenylate cyclase.", 
    "37": "The hydrophilic ligand 3H-CGP 12177 was used to measure beta-adrenergic receptors on intact human mononuclear leukocytes (MNLs). A single homogeneous class of receptor sites was found, with KD value of 0.71 +/- 0.04 nmol/L and Bmax of 3.0 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells (mean +/- SEM; n = 12). The receptor affinity (KD) and density (Bmax) were similar when measured on MNLs, purified lymphocytes, and a T-lymphocyte-enriched population from the same individual. Preincubation of intact MNLs with 1 mumol/L isoproterenol at 37 degrees C for 20 minutes reduced the number of surface receptors, measured by 3H-CGP 12177 binding at 4 degrees C for 20 hours, by approximately 70% (receptor internalization) without affecting KD. This effect was reversible, and surface receptors completely reappeared when binding was investigated at 37 degrees C for 40 minutes. Receptor internalization was similar when either isolated MNLs or whole blood was incubated with isoproterenol. Agonist-induced receptor internalization was stable during MNL isolation from whole blood at 4 degrees C but was partially or completely lost from MNLs prepared at 20 degrees C.", 
    "38": "Neuro-effector transmission and mechanical responses in smooth muscles of the dog iris were studied, using tension recording and microelectrode methods. Electrical stimulations evoked an initial phasic contraction followed by relaxation in both the iris sphincter and dilator muscles. Atropine selectively suppressed phasic contraction of the sphincter and relaxation of the dilator muscle, while guanethidine selectively blocked relaxation of the sphincter and contraction of the dilator muscle. Pharmacological investigations revealed distributions of alpha 1-excitatory (mediating contractions) and alpha 2-inhibitory (mediating relaxations) adrenoceptors in addition to beta-inhibitory adrenoceptors in the sphincter muscles, and alpha-excitatory and beta-inhibitory adrenoceptors in the dilator muscle. These results indicate that the iris sphincter and dilator muscles receive double reciprocal innervations by the cholinergic and adrenergic nervous systems. Norepinephrine (NE) or carbachol did not modify membrane potential of the smooth muscle cells in either muscle tissue, yet these agents evoked muscle relaxation or contraction, respectively; in the sphincter muscle. Reversed sequences of mechanical responses were observed in the dilator. Ca-free solution reduced the resting tension and blocked the agonist-induced contraction in both muscle tissues. Excess-[K]0 solution dose-dependently depolarized the muscle membrane, and evoked combined mechanical responses of relaxation and contraction which were blocked by adrenergic and cholinergic blocking agents, mainly due to NE or acetylcholine (ACh) released from the nerve terminals in both muscle tissues. In the sphincter muscle, excess-[K]0 solution evoked a phasic contraction in the presence of these blocking agents. Specific mechanical features of the dog iris in relation to excitation-contraction coupling were given attention.", 
    "39": "An abnormal resting ST segment renders the stress ECG impossible to interpret. Therefore, one must substitute a radionuclide stress evaluation in the presence of digitalis, left bundle-branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, a paced rhythm, or any other condition that would cause abnormal baseline ST segments. All these are more common in the elderly. Beta-blocker therapy is useful in patients with demand-related ischemia because it decreases two of the major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand: heart rate and contractility. Propranolol, timolol, and metoprolol have been shown to decrease the reinfarction and mortality rates in patients who have had an infarction.", 
    "40": "Betaxolol is a relatively cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, with no partial agonist (intrinsic sympathomimetic) activity and weak membrane-stabilising (local anaesthetic) activity. Its pharmacokinetic properties of most interest include high bioavailability after oral administration, and a long elimination half-life. It has a narrow dose-response range, which obviates the need for dose titration, with 10 to 20 mg once daily being the usual dosage. This dose reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressures by about 15 mm Hg in most patients with mild to moderate hypertension. In a few comparative studies betaxolol 20 mg daily was as effective as atenolol and moderate doses of propranolol, and more effective than acebutolol, in reducing blood pressure in such patients. Betaxolol has been well tolerated in most patients. Thus, betaxolol is an effective alternative to other beta-blocking drugs in patients with essential hypertension, with properties that may offer advantages in some patients.", 
    "41": "This rapid, sensitive, simple radioreceptor assay (RRA) for l-propranolol and its active metabolites in unextracted samples requires 5 microL of sample, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, 125-l-labeled (-)cyanopindolol (125ICYP), and turkey erythrocyte membrane receptors (Kd = 40 pmol/L). Equal volumes (100 microL) of diluted sample and 125ICYP are incubated with 500 microL of erythrocyte membranes for 30 min. Cold isotonic saline (2.5 mL) is added, and the mixture is centrifuged. The concentration of drug that inhibited receptor binding by 50% (IC50) was l-propranolol, 1.5 micrograms/L; d-propranolol, 243 micrograms/L; and 4-hydroxypropranolol, 8.8 micrograms/L. Analytical recovery of propranolol added to serum was 93 to 120%; results for 138 clinical samples tested by this method and by liquid chromatography correlated well (r = 0.96). Results correlated strongly (r = 0.98) for 23 clinical samples tested by RRA and analyzed for both propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol by liquid chromatography. The sensitivity of this RRA was 0.3 micrograms/L, and both intra- and interassay CVs were less than 12%. Modifications of this method could permit testing of other nonselective beta-blockers.", 
    "42": "beta blockers are now well established as alternative first-line drugs for treating hypertension. Bopindolol is a new beta blocker with a long duration of action and antihypertensive properties at low dosage. To assess the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect and tolerance of bopindolol, 590 hypertensive patients with diastolic BP greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg (age 22-78 years; mean +/- SD, 51 +/- 10) were evaluated prospectively by a study group of 248 practicing physicians. Following discontinuation of previous antihypertensive drugs for 4 weeks and/or a 2-week placebo phase, bopindolol 1 mg/day was given for 12 weeks. Bopindolol dose was decreased to 0.5 mg/day if diastolic BP after 8 weeks was less than or equal to 85 mm Hg; chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day was added if diastolic BP was greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg after 4 or 8 weeks of bopindolol monotherapy. Compared to placebo, BP was lowered (p less than 0.0001) by bopindolol monotherapy (n = 273) from 159/104 +/- 14/4 to 139/89 +/- 12/6 mm Hg, by combination treatment (n = 288) from 165/108 +/- 16/6 to 145/95 +/- 16/7 mm Hg. Diastolic BP was reduced to less than 95 mm Hg by bopindolol 0.5 or 1 mg/day in 241 patients, by combination treatment in 150 patients. Bopindolol-induced absolute or percentage decreases in systolic or diastolic BP correlated with pretreatment BP (r = 0.22-0.51, p less than 0.001), but not with age (r = -0.05 to 0.08).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The clinical efficacy of bopindolol, a new, long-acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in a dosage of 1-2 mg daily was compared with that of atenolol (50-100 mg daily) in 33 patients with mild or moderate arterial hypertension who were treated for a total period of 12 months. Both drugs lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure to about the same extent, but atenolol caused a somewhat greater lowering of heart rate. Over 70% of patients receiving atenolol required a diuretic in addition, whereas only 55% of the bopindolol patients required a diuretic. Both drugs maintained 24-h blood pressure reduction with once-daily therapy, although circadian rhythm (recorded using a Remler device) tended to be lost during treatment with atenolol but not with bopindolol.", 
    "44": "Fourteen male patients, mean age 53 years (range 35-64), were included in an initial 3 months' double-blind crossover study, in which 1-2 mg bopindolol, a nonselective beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), was compared with 100-200 mg metoprolol regarding effects on blood pressure and heart rate. During the subsequent long-term therapy, eight patients were trained to measure home blood pressure, and in these patients bopindolol 1 mg daily was compared to 8 mg once weekly in a double-blind fashion for 3 weeks on each regimen. Bopindolol (mean dose 1.35 mg/day) caused a significant blood pressure reduction, 26/15 mm Hg, as did metoprolol, 24/3 mm Hg (mean dose 144 mg/day) (NS). Supine and standing heart rates were reduced during both bopindolol and metoprolol treatment. During long-term therapy with bopindolol satisfactory blood pressure control was achieved for 1 year in 11 patients. Heart rate was significantly reduced after 2-3 months' treatment and during the entire 1-year follow-up. Few and well-tolerated side effects were reported. During treatment with bopindolol 8 mg once weekly, the blood pressure control was maintained satisfactorily over the week and no significant differences were observed in comparison with daily administration (1 mg) of the drug.", 
    "45": "Abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may lead to \"rebound effects.\" To investigate the position of the new nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bopindolol [with moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)], this drug was compared with propranolol (no ISA), alprenolol (weak ISA), and pindolol (marked ISA). The effects on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density--assessed by (+/-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding--were investigated in healthy volunteers aged 23-35 years. None of the test drugs changed the affinity of ICYP for beta 2 adrenoceptors. Propranolol treatment (4 X 40 mg/day) increased the density of beta 2-adrenoceptors by 25% after 2 days; during treatment beta 2-adrenoceptor density remained elevated. After withdrawal of propranolol, beta 2-adrenoceptor density declined slowly, being still significantly increased after 3 days, although propranolol was not detectable in plasma after 24 h, though heart rate was significantly increased. Alprenolol treatment (4 X 100 mg/day) did not significantly affect beta 2-adrenoceptor density. Pindolol treatment (2 X 5 mg/day) caused a 50% decrease of beta 2-adrenoceptor density after 2 days, which remained reduced during treatment. After withdrawal, beta 2-adrenoceptor density was still significantly diminished after 4 days. During and after treatment heart rate was not affected. Bopindolol treatment (2 mg/day) caused a 40% decrease of beta 2-adrenoceptor density after 2 days, which remained reduced during treatment. After withdrawal, beta 2-adrenoceptor density was still significantly diminished after 4 days. During and after treatment heart rate was not affected. It is concluded that the ISA may play an important role in modulating beta 2-adrenoceptor density and hence tissue responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "beta-Adrenoceptor sensitivity after abrupt withdrawal of long-term therapy (5-12 months) with bopindolol (1-2 mg/day), a long-acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was assessed in five patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. The chronotropic dose 25 of isoproterenol (CD 25), plasma concentrations of catecholamines, triiodothyronine and thyroxin, plasma renin activity and aldosterone, hemoglobin, hematocrit and oxyhemoglobin dissociation were measured on the last day of bopindolol administration and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 13 days after abrupt replacement by placebo tablets. The chronotropic dose 25 of isoproterenol (microgram/m2) was greater than 25.6 in all patients on the last day of bopindolol therapy. On day 1 in patients who had been taking 2 mg/day of bopindolol, CD 25 remained greater than 25.6 but fell to 12.1 in the one patient who had been taking 1 mg/day. On day 2, CD 25 was 10.19 +/- 2.97 and felt gradually to the lowest value of 3.76 +/- 1.19 on day 13. Throughout the study, plasma concentrations of catecholamines, triiodothyronine and thyroxin, and oxyhemoglobin dissociation remained unchanged. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone, which were suppressed during bopindolol therapy, rose during placebo, coinciding with a fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit. No subjective symptoms of increased beta-adrenoceptor-mediated functions were reported by the patients throughout the whole study period. Therefore, hypersensitivity of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses was not demonstrated within the first 13 days after sudden withdrawal of bopindolol.", 
    "47": "The effect of bopindolol on circadian blood pressure and heart rate profile was evaluated by means of an automatic recording technique (Pressurometer II). Blood pressure and heart rate was measured every 15 min for 24 h in 11 ambulant hypertensive patients. Recordings were made after 2 weeks on placebo then after treatment for 4 and 8 weeks with single daily doses of 0.5 or 1 mg bopindolol, according to a double-blind crossover plan. The results show a significant fall in the mean 24-h values for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate on both dosages of bopindolol. The low-dose level had a more marked effect on the day phase of the blood pressure profile, whereas the high-dose level affected day and night phases equally. Over all, the circadian rhythms of blood pressure and heart rate were not influenced. In conclusion, bopindolol has a well-defined antihypertensive effect on the various phases of the 24-h blood pressure and heart rate profiles.", 
    "48": "The effects of a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) (atenolol) and a noncardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker with ISA (bopindolol) on circadian heart rate were studied in 10 patients (2 women and 8 men) with an average age of 52 years and the following diagnoses: coronary heart disease (n = 4) and hypertension (n = 6). The patients were treated in a randomized crossover study with 100 mg atenolol p.o. and 1 mg bopindolol p.o. Atenolol lowered the averaged circadian heart rate (HR) significantly (p less than 0.001), from 70-59 beats/min. The HR decreased during the day and also at night. After bopindolol the average circadian HR decreased only slightly, from 69-64 beats/min. HR was reduced during the day but not during the night. Nine out of 10 patients receiving atenolol developed hourly HRs less than 55 beats/min compared to 3 patients on bopindolol. There was a significant increase of hourly segments (HR less than 55 beats/min) from 11-85 and also for hourly segments with HR less than 50 beats/min from 0-46 with atenolol, whereas no significant change could be detected under bopindolol. Both drugs produced similar reductions in exercise-induced increases in HR and systolic blood pressure and these effects persisted for more than 24 h.", 
    "49": "Since beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs were originally discovered and shown to be important therapeutic agents in the management of both angina pectoris and hypertension, many other similar drugs have become available. These share the common property of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism, though they may vary in terms of potency. However, they differ from one another in terms of their additional pharmacological properties--cardioselectivity, partial agonist activity, and membrane stabilizing activity. Cardioselectivity refers to the ability of some drugs, notably atenolol and metoprolol, to block beta 1 receptors without blocking beta 2 receptors. This has been considered to be of potential importance in patients with obstructive airways disease, patients with peripheral vascular disease, and patients with insulin-dependent diabetes during hypoglycemic crisis. Partial agonist activity is the intrinsic activity that some drugs have to stimulate the beta adrenoceptor while they are competitively antagonizing catecholamines. In consequence, they may have less effect on resting heart rate, cardiac output, peripheral vascular blood flow, and resting respiratory function. However, there is no good evidence that major adverse effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs such as congestive heart failure, bronchospasm, or symptoms of peripheral vascular disease are prevented by drugs with partial agonist activity: bradycardia may be improved, but its importance has probably been overemphasized. Membrane-stabilizing activity appears to be unimportant. As far as pharmacokinetic differences between drugs are concerned, lipid solubility is seen to be of increasing importance. The more water-soluble drugs have longer elimination half-lives, produce less interindividual variation in steady-state plasma concentrations, and penetrate the central nervous system less readily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The effect of the long-acting beta-blocking agent bopindolol on renal function was assessed in 10 healthy normotensive volunteers and 10 hypertensive patients. The subjects received 1 mg bopindolol at 8 p.m. for 21 days. The following determinations were made at 8 a.m. on recumbent, fasting subjects before day 0 (D0) and 12 h after day 1 (D1) the first dose of bopindolol, and on the 21st day of treatment (D21): blood pressure (diastolic = DBP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) as reflected by the plasma disappearance of 51Cr-EDTA and 125I-hippuran, plasma concentrations and 2- and 24-h urinary excretion of electrolytes, creatinine, and proteins and osmolality of the urine. Plasma renin activity was assessed on standing subjects. Following bopindolol administration GFR, RPF, and filtration fraction remained stable, in spite of a fall of DBP from 80 +/- 7 to 76 +/- 4 and to 72 +/- 9 mm Hg in normotensives (p less than 0.05) and from 106 +/- 11-96 +/- 10 and to 91 +/- 8 mm Hg in hypertensives (p less than 0.05) on D1 and D21, respectively. The drops in DBP at D1 correlated weakly with the pretreatment renin levels (p = 0.074, p less than 0.05). All the other variables remained stable, including diuresis, free water clearance, and fractional sodium excretion. It is concluded that in contrast to many other anti-hypertensive drugs including several beta blockers, bopindolol does not reduce renal function during short- or medium-term treatment in normal volunteers or hypertensive patients.", 
    "51": "The influence of bopindolol monotherapy on blood pressure and plasma lipid fractions was investigated in 24 hypertensive patients. Bopindolol lowered blood pressure and heart rate significantly. When compared with placebo, no changes were found in the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Plasma triglycerides were significantly increased after 4 and 8 weeks but not after 12 weeks of bopindolol. It is concluded that bopindolol is an effective and well tolerated beta blocker in hypertensive patients. That it does not lower HDL cholesterol could be a potential advantage.", 
    "52": "Bopindolol is a new beta blocker with a long duration of action. We examined the haemodynamic effects of multiple oral doses of 2 mg in 12 male patients, with coronary artery disease. Placebo was given for 7 days followed by bopindolol 2 mg daily for 14 days. Scintigraphic ventriculography combined with an exercise test was carried out at baseline before treatment with bopindolol, and repeated after 7 and 14 days treatment. On day 7 the measurements were made 2 h after therapy (i.e., when plasma levels were maximal) and on day 14 when plasma levels were lowest (24 h after the last dose). The results showed that bopindolol had little effect on blood pressure or heart rate at rest in these normotensive patients but that both parameters measured after exercise were statistically significantly reduced (p less than 0.001). There was little difference between the effect seen 2 h after therapy and the effect seen 24 h after therapy, thus, demonstrating the long duration of action. The mean ejection fraction was not changed by bopindolol either at rest or after exercise but individual patients who responded to exercise with a fall in ejection fraction before treatment did not do so following treatment. These were mainly patients with 2 and 3 artery disease and the failure of the mean ejection fraction to show this protective effect was probably due to the predominance in our patients of those with mild single vessel disease who did not react adversely to exercise. We conclude that bopindolol protects the myocardium against ischaemia and that the effect lasts for at least 24 h when therapy is given once daily.", 
    "53": "Twelve subjects with chronic obstructive lung disease and a partially reversible obstruction received increasing single doses (1, 2, 4, and 8 mg) of bopindolol, (a new beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), pindolol (7.5, 15, and 30 mg), and atenolol (50 and 100 mg). The actions of the drugs on lung function were assessed by whole-body plethysmography. Pindolol did not influence mean airway resistance (Raw). Bopindolol 1, 2, and 4 mg and atenolol 50 mg also exhibited a neutral effect on mean Raw. Atenolol 100 mg, however, induced a long-lasting increase in mean Raw, which was to a lesser extent the case with bopindolol 8 mg. Six of the 12 subjects tested reacted more sensibly. Increases in Raw of more than 10% were observed with bopindolol 2 mg (1 subject), bopindolol 4 mg (4 subjects), pindolol 30 mg (3 subjects), and atenolol 50 mg (3 subjects). This clearly points toward a potential risk of eventually developing severe bronchospasm with each type of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and a reversible component of the bronchial obstruction. Nevertheless it is concluded that beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as bopindolol and pindolol compare favorably with cardioselective agents such as atenolol.", 
    "54": "Bopindolol is a new beta blocker with a long duration of action which exerts antihypertensive effects at very low dosage. The aim of this study was to define the optimal dosage of bopindolol in outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension and to compare it to atenolol in term of tolerance and efficacy, both administered once daily. Forty physicians (the Swiss Cooperative Study Group) participated as investigators in this study. They had recruited 257 hypertensive patients whose diastolic blood pressure was between 95 and 105 mm Hg (age 19-69 years; mean +/- SD, 49.3/49.9 +/- 10/11) in a multicentric double-blind study. After a 2-week placebo period patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: bopindolol 1 mg, bopindolol 2 mg, atenolol 50 mg, and atenolol 100 mg. After 4 weeks of active treatment, if diastolic blood pressure was above 90 mm Hg, the dosage was doubled. A detailed evaluation was performed after 8 weeks of active treatment. If necessary, a diuretic was then added and patients were followed for the next 10 months in an open study. Compared to placebo, blood pressure was significantly lowered in the four treatment groups. At 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 months, there was no significant difference between the blood pressures of the treatment groups. Bopindolol was as well tolerated as atenolol. Bradycardia was more common with atenolol. During this 12-month study, bopindolol 1 mg per day appeared to be an effective and a safe antihypertensive treatment. With the exception of the lower incidence of bradycardia, bopindolol is indistinguishable from atenolol in terms of side effects pattern and frequency.", 
    "55": "Hepatic drug metabolism influenced by genetic and environmental factors is a major source of variation in the response to a number of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. The first study described here was carried out to define the role of a genetic determinant (debrisoquine-type oxidation polymorphism) on plasma concentration of bopindolol and its pharmacological effect. Atenolol was used as a negative and metoprolol as a positive control. In a second study, the relative potency and duration of action of bopindolol were assessed in comparison to atenolol and slow-release oxprenolol. The first study was carried out using 10 healthy volunteers (6 extensive and 4 poor metabolizers), and the second study was carried out using 12 volunteers, all of whom were extensive metabolizers. Genetic polymorphism did not influence the kinetic behavior or pharmacological effects of atenolol. The elimination of bopindolol was slightly but significantly prolonged in poor metabolizers, but this did not significantly alter the cardiac effects of the drug. In the case of metoprolol poor metabolizers showed a significant prolongation of drug elimination, and this was associated with a significant prolongation of the cardiac effects of the drug. The second study revealed that, in terms of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade, 1 mg bopindolol was equipotent to 100 mg atenolol or 160 mg slow-release oxprenolol and that both bopindolol and atenolol had a longer duration of action than slow-release oxprenolol. It is concluded that bopindolol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with a very long duration of action which shows little interindividual variability.", 
    "56": "Models describing the time course of effects (pharmacodynamic models) of various beta blockers in man are used to explain the long duration of action of bopindolol. No matter what effect is used [reduction in exercise heart rate (RER) or isoproterenol dose ratio (DR)] human data show clearly that bopindolol is very potent compared to other beta blockers such as atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol, practolol, and propranolol. In pharmacokinetic terms, however, these drugs show no pronounced difference in their elimination half-life (ranging between 4 and 8 h). Also the site of action of the therapeutic effects (beta 1 receptors) is obviously identical for all beta blockers. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that bopindolol (the prodrug) or hydrolyzed bopindolol (the active substance) is further metabolized to a slowly eliminated active metabolite. Thus, drug disposition provides no argument to explain the long-lasting effects of bopindolol as compared other beta blockers. The long duration of action of bopindolol seems to reflect an usually flat plasma concentration-response curve.", 
    "57": "Bopindolol is a potent beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity that exhibits a long duration of action. The cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by an oral dose of 1 mg bopindolol is of similar intensity as that seen after atenolol 100 mg p.o. or pindolol 10 mg p.o. Like other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, bopindolol is effective in inhibiting resting and stimulated plasma renin activity. In contrast to compounds lacking ISA, bopindolol does not produce undesirable changes in plasma lipoprotein composition during chronic therapy. Its bioavailability after oral administration amounts to about 70%. In the studies reviewed, bopindolol was well tolerated even after an oral dose of 12 mg, which, as far as beta-adrenoceptor blockade is concerned, would be equivalent to a single oral dose of about 1.2 g of atenolol. The onset of action of bopindolol is relatively slow, a feature that to a certain extent might account for the good tolerance of the drug observed in experimental and therapeutic studies. The delayed onset of action of the drug has facilitated the elucidation of the relationship between plasma levels and pharmacological effects during the period immediately after oral administration. Analysis of the temporal relationship between drug plasma levels and beta-adrenoceptor blockade provides evidence suggesting that the cardiac beta adrenoceptors lie outside the plasma compartment.", 
    "58": "In a double-blind crossover study, the influence of bisoprolol and placebo was tested in 20 noninsulin-dependent diabetics with concomitant essential hypertension. A 2-week washout placebo period was followed by two treatment periods of 2 weeks each with 10 mg bisoprolol or placebo. Compared with placebo, bisoprolol did not change blood glucose, haemoglobin A1 (HbA1), and glucosuria. No hypoglycaemia was observed. Serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels remained constant. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) were significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced after 2 weeks of bisoprolol therapy, compared with placebo. It was concluded that bisoprolol, in a dose therapeutically effective in essential hypertension, has no influence on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in noninsulin-dependent patients with diabetes mellitus; and 10 mg bisoprolol is effective for the normalisation of SBP and DBP in mildly hypertensive diabetics. Since bisoprolol was well tolerated in the dosage studied, it can be recommended for noninsulin-dependent diabetics with hypertension.", 
    "59": "The adrenergic control of carbohydrate metabolism is expressed at two levels: regulation of substrate flow, and interference with the secretion of hormones. Normally, this adrenergic regulatory system only plays a minor role. However, it is of great importance as an acute adaptation of the body to fight and flight. Under these circumstances, fuel fluxes increase almost instantaneously. Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are responsible for increased hepatic glucose output. Increased fatty acid flux is brought about by stimulated adipose tissue lipolysis, which probably, as a secondary phenomenon, causes decreased peripheral glucose utilisation by the skeletal muscle mass. Cerebral glucose uptake accounts for half the body's basal glucose production. Since this glucose uptake is concentration-dependent only, hypoglycaemia rapidly leads to cerebral dysfunction. To guarantee cerebral glucose uptake, the body has a dual defense mechanism against hypoglycaemia: hormonal and metabolic counteraction. The first consists of the secretion of glucagon and (nor)epinephrine, the latter of hepatic autoregulation and alternative fuels for noncerebral tissues. In clinical practice, the inappropriate insulin-excess state forms the major cause of hypoglycaemia. There is, however, a second reason why patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk. Diabetes by itself leads to impaired glucagon secretion and, when autonomic neuropathy exists, to diminished (nor)epinephrine secretion. Thus, interference with the latter, such as administration of beta-blocking agents, further impairs hypoglycaemic counterregulation. In fact, numerous studies document delayed recovery from experimentally induced hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients receiving beta-blocking agents. However, using beta 1-selective blocking agents, mean recovery from hypoglycaemia in groups of diabetic patients demonstrates minor delay only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "The effects of single doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg of bisoprolol on left ventricular performance were assessed by left ventricular systolic time interval measurements, echocardiographic measurements, and exercise stress tests in patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension. Bisoprolol caused a significant, dose-dependent fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate, at rest and under exercise stress test. Left ventricular systolic time intervals were prolonged at the higher doses, but pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time (PEP/LVET) ratio, as an indicator for left ventricular performance, remained unchanged. Left ventricular echocardiographic dimensions increased significantly, but shortening fraction was not altered. We conclude that 10-40 mg bisoprolol, apart from the blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors, does not affect left ventricular cardiac function.", 
    "61": "The aim of this study was to investigate the haemodynamics of the beta 1-selective beta-blocker bisoprolol at plasma concentrations that would be expected to block completely the cardiac beta-receptors. Seven patients with stable exercise-dependent angina pectoris received 40 mg bisoprolol, and six patients received 10 mg bisoprolol orally as a single dose. Before and 1.5 h after administration, the following parameters were measured at rest and during physical exercise within the framework of an invasive diagnostic investigation: cardiac output, blood pressure in the systemic and pulmonary circulation, heart rate, and ST-segment change. Further haemodynamic factors were derived from these parameters. Before beta-blockade, the change from rest to exercise resulted in an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac index, and also in an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as an indication of ischaemically induced left-ventricular dysfunction. After 40 mg bisoprolol, under exercise conditions, the cardiac index decreased as a consequence of reduced heart rate, and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased slightly, compared with baseline. This finding was attributable to clearer changes in three patients; however, as an overall result, an improvement of oxygen consumption also was achieved in these patients. Measured by reduction in cardiac index, no appreciable increase in effect was achieved at bisoprolol plasma concentrations greater than 60 ng/ml. In angina pectoris patients, bisoprolol possesses the typical haemodynamic profile of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. There was no indication of a beta-blockade-independent negative inotropic effect of bisoprolol. Forty mg bisoprolol was shown to be an unnecessarily high dose. It may be deduced that the therapeutic dose range of bisoprolol is between 5 and 20 mg.", 
    "62": "To assess acute hemodynamic effects of bisoprolol on left ventricular hemodynamics at rest and during exercise, 16 patients with documented chronic ischemic heart disease were studied and compared with patients after administration of metoprolol and bufuralol. Simultaneous right heart catheterization and radionuclide angiocardiography were performed at rest and during exercise before and after drug administration. Bisoprolol was given orally to 16 patients, six receiving 5 mg, and 10 patients receiving 20 mg. Metoprolol was injected intravenously in a dose of 0.15 mg/kg to another 16 patients, and 30 mg bufuralol were given orally to 10 patients. The hemodynamic profiles of all three compounds were similar to that previously described after acute beta-blockade. All three drugs tested and compared showed a marked negative chronotropic effect, while there were slight differences in the negative inotropic and blood pressure lowering effect. Bisoprolol induced only mild negative inotropic changes, which were barely detectable after the 5 mg dose. The negative inotropic changes were more pronounced after metoprolol, and were partly balanced by the vasodilating properties of bufuralol. Thus, bisoprolol showed a significantly reduced rate pressure product with only a relatively mild negative inotropic effect. Based on these observations, even the higher dose of 20 mg bisoprolol seems to be hemodynamically safe for clinical application.", 
    "63": "The cardioselectivity and hypotensive properties of the beta 1-specific beta-blocker bisoprolol were investigated using a single-dose comparison of 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol, 100 mg atenolol, and placebo in 12 hypertensive asthmatic patients. The study was of a randomised four-way crossover design with 1 week's washout between each treatment. beta 1-Selectivity was determined by using lung function parameters--vital capacity (VC), airway resistance (AWR), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume (FEV1)--at baseline and at predetermined intervals following each medication and salbutamol challenge. Potency of beta-blockade was determined using heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). 100 mg atenolol and 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol reduced HR, SBP, and DBP 2 h postmedication. All active treatments produced only small nonsignificant reductions in PEFR, FEV1, and VC, compared with baseline, without any significant differences between the four groups. Bisoprolol at both dose levels had only a minor nonsignificant influence on AWR. 100 mg atenolol significantly increased AWR, compared with placebo. Following all treatments, salbutamol did not affect cardiovascular parameters, but significantly reduced AWR and increased PEFR, FEV1, and VC without any significant differences between groups. Bisoprolol, at both dose levels tested, was found to possess a strong beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking activity without affecting bronchial beta 2-adrenoceptors. An equipotent beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking dose of atenolol (100 mg), compared with 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol, was found to increase airway resistance in the population of asthmatic patients studied. Bisoprolol has been shown to exhibit a greater beta 1-selectivity than atenolol.", 
    "64": "The respiratory tolerance of the beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective blockers bisoprolol and metoprolol was investigated in eight male asthmatic patients. The interaction with the bronchodilatory effect of the beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist terbutaline was studied to compare the beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol and 100 mg metoprolol. The three beta-blocker doses caused a significant decrease in heart rate at rest. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after administration of 20 mg bisoprolol and 100 mg metoprolol, but not after administration of 10 mg bisoprolol. Both beta-blockers caused an increase in bronchoconstriction, as measured by a significant fall in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Only 10 mg bisoprolol caused a significant decrease in vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). Bronchoconstriction was rapidly reversed by inhalation of terbutaline in all patients. There were no differences between the responses of FEV1, VC, and PEFR to terbutaline with any of the beta-blockers, indicating a good degree of beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of 10 and 20 mg bisoprolol and 100 mg metoprolol in humans.", 
    "65": "In an open study with 16 angina pectoris patients with concomitant chronic obstructive bronchitis, the effect of single oral doses of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bisoprolol (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 40 mg) on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), airway resistance (AWR), and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was investigated. In the dose range between 5 and 20 mg, no increase in AWR and no decrease in FEV1 was observed. Thirty and 40 mg of bisoprolol produced an increase in AWR and a decrease in FEV1. A reduction in BP and HR was observed even after the lowest bisoprolol dose.", 
    "66": "The degree of cardiac and vascular beta-adrenoceptor blockade of bisoprolol and atenolol was determined by the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25) of isoproterenol (the dose of an intravenous isoproterenol bolus required to increase resting heart rate by 25 beats/min) and by the increase in forearm blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) to intrabrachial artery infusions of increasing doses of isoproterenol (0.12, 1.2, 4, 12, and 20 ng/min/100 ml forearm tissue). Measurements were taken following placebo and after one week's treatment with atenolol or bisoprolol under double-blind conditions using a within-patient crossover design. Two patients received 10 mg bisoprolol and 50 mg atenolol daily, and three patients 20 and 100 mg daily, respectively. Both beta-blockers produced a similar fall in blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma renin activity. While CD25 of isoproterenol was comparable for both drugs, forearm blood flow to intra-arterial infusion of isoproterenol increased to a greater extent following bisoprolol (20 mg) than during atenolol (100 mg) treatment. Equieffective cardiac beta-blockade with bisoprolol and atenolol was associated with a lesser degree of vascular beta-adrenoceptor blockade during treatment with the more cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol.", 
    "67": "The beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of bisoprolol (BPL) was investigated using the forearm circulation of eight healthy subjects. Each subject was studied twice, with at least 10 days in between each investigation. A brachial artery was cannulated for intra-arterial (i.a.) monitoring of blood pressure and for i.a. infusion of isoproterenol (ISO) and epinephrine (EPI). ISO was given in doses of 0.02-0.10-0.40 and 1.20 ng/kg/min, for 3 min per dose. After 20 min rest, EPI was infused in doses of 0.08 and 2.0 ng/kg/min for 6 min per dose. Subsequently, the subjects received an oral dose of either 20 mg BPL or 100 mg atenolol (ATL), and 2 h later, the ISO and EPI infusions were repeated. Forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography. ISO produced a dose-dependent vasodilatation, whereas the response to EPI varied between individuals. After administration of BPL and ATL, the ISO dose-response curves were shifted to the right by 2.8 and 2.6 times, respectively (both p less than 0.01). Both beta-blockers influenced the vascular effect of EPI in the direction of vasoconstriction. However, this was only significant for ATL (p less than 0.05). From the latter observation it is concluded that BPL is slightly more beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective than ATL, using the forearm vascular bed.", 
    "68": "beta 1-Selectivity or beta 1/beta 2-splitting, i.e., the selectivity ratio between the potency of a beta-blocking agent to block beta 1-versus beta 2-mediated responses, was assessed in 16 healthy male volunteers. The study was carried out to an intraindividual, randomized crossover design comparing bisoprolol (0.07 mg/kg i.v.) with the following beta-blocking agents: acebutolol (0.8 mg/kg i.v.), metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.), penbutolol (0.04 mg/kg i.v.), and propranolol (0.2 mg/kg i.v.). Exercise tachycardia was used as a mainly beta 1-receptor-mediated response: the beta-blocking effect was quantified as a work load ratio after/before beta-blockade for a given heart rate. Decrease in diastolic blood pressure after isoprenaline was used as a mainly beta 2-receptor-mediated response: the beta-blocking effect was quantified as an isoprenaline dose ratio after/before beta-blockade for a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 25 mm Hg. Assessing the data for a beta 1/beta 2-splitting as 1 for propranolol, the relative beta 1-selectivity (mean +/- SEM) was 12.2 +/- 1.1 for bisoprolol, 9.0 +/- 0.9 for metoprolol, 6.2 +/- 0.6 for acebutolol, and 0.6 +/- 0.06 for penbutolol. There was a significant difference (p less than 0.01) between the cardioselective compounds bisoprolol, metoprolol, and acebutolol on one side, and the nonselective compounds propranolol and penbutolol on the other side. Within the group of nonselective compounds, propranolol and penbutolol differed from each other (p less than 0.05), penbutolol being even less beta 1-selective than propranolol. Within the group of \"cardioselective\" compounds, bisoprolol and metoprolol appeared to be superior to acebutolol (p less than 0.05). However, it cannot be dismissed that these within-group differences merely reflect the considerable decrease of plasma levels of acebutolol and penbutolol which were observed after ergometric exercise in comparison with the plasma levels after isoprenaline tests.", 
    "69": "After oral administration of single doses of 240 mg of (+/-)propranolol (prop), 200 mg of (+/-)-atenolol (aten), and 100 mg of (+/-)-bisoprolol (biso) to six healthy male volunteers, the plasma concentration time profile was investigated. To measure total plasma concentrations of the parent racemic mixture of drug administered, a HPLC-assay of drug concentrations was used. To detect active metabolites and stereoselective pharmacokinetics of the racemates, plasma concentrations were also monitored by means of a subtype-selective receptor assay, using a beta 1-adrenoceptor preparation from rat salivary glands. It is shown that relevant amounts of active metabolites do not become apparent for either of the three drugs investigated. Furthermore, for neither of them can significant stereoselective elimination characteristics be seen. Monophasic elimination characteristics with t1/2 of 4.8 +/- 0.42 (prop), 6.87 +/- 0.46 (aten), and 9.19 +/- 0.38 h (biso) become apparent. The maximum concentrations observed after administration of the doses mentioned previously were 220 +/- 71 (prop), 904 +/- 104 (aten), and 445 +/- 32 (biso) (ng/ml plasma). One can conclude from comparison with the results from receptor-binding studies that the 100 mg dose of biso is five- to seven-fold more potent than the 200 mg dose of aten, with respect to antagonism versus beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects.", 
    "70": "The potency order of the catecholamines (-)-isoprenaline (Iso), (-)-noradrenaline (NA), and (-)-adrenaline (Adr) in competition for radiolabelled sites is used for their pharmacological classification. It is shown that the radioligand 3H-CGP 12177 exclusively labels beta 1-adrenoceptors in rat salivary gland membranes (Iso greater than NA greater than Adr), and beta 2-adrenoceptors in rat reticulocytes (Iso greater than Adr greater than or equal to NA). These models are then used to derive the subtype-selectivity of the classical beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (+/-)-propranolol (prop; twofold beta 2-selective) and (+/-)-atenolol (aten; 35-fold beta 1-selective), as well as of the newer antagonists (+/-)-betaxolol and (+/-)-bisoprolol (betax and biso; 35-fold and 75-fold beta 1-selective, respectively). The ligand with the highest selectivity is ICI 118,551 (ICI), with a 300-fold beta 2-subtype selectivity. For comparison with antagonistic effects in humans at given plasma concentrations, the equilibrium dissociation constants of the ligands are measured in the presence of native human plasma and yield values for the relative selectively labelled subtype in the mean (Ki-values in nmol/l): prop: 20, aten: 250, biso: 24, betax: 23, and ICI: 2.5.",

Binding studies with (-)-[125I] iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) revealed that the affinity of (+/-)-bisoprolol to beta 1-adrenoceptors was approximately 100 times higher than to beta 2-adrenoceptors. This high beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of bisoprolol could be confirmed in binding studies with the tritiated compound (-)[3H] bisoprolol, which labelled in rabbit lung membranes--a tissue known to contain 80% beta 1- and 20% beta 2-adrenoceptors--exclusively beta 1-adrenoceptors. In physiological studies, (+/-)-bisoprolol was found to be devoid of any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), since it had no positive chronotropic effects on spontaneously beating right atria of reserpinized rats. On isolated electrically driven human right atria, (+/-)-bisoprolol was approximately 30 times more potent in antagonizing the beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect of noradrenaline (pA2-value, 8.42) than the beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated positive inotropic effect of procaterol (pA2-value, 6.99). To test the beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity in vivo, the effects of bisoprolol administration (1 X 10 mg/day for 9 days) on lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor density [assessed by (-)-ICYP binding] in healthy volunteers were compared with those of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (4 X 40 mg/day for 9 days) without ISA, and pindolol (2 X 5 mg/day for 9 days) with ISA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "The pharmacokinetic properties of bisoprolol-14C were studied in Wistar rats, beagle dogs, and Cynomolgus monkeys. Bisoprolol is well absorbed in these species; independent of the route of administration (i.v. or p.o.), 70-90% of the 14C-dose was recovered in urine. Faecal excretion was approximately 20% in rats and less than 10% in dogs and monkeys. Rats excreted approximately 10% of the dose in bile after i.v. as well as after oral administration. The plasma half-life of the unchanged drug was approximately 1 h in rats, 3 h in monkeys, and 5 h in dogs. The bioavailability was 40-50% in monkeys, approximately 80% in dogs, and 10% in rats. Studies in rats have shown that the drug is rapidly taken up by the tissues. After i.v. administration, high levels of radioactivity were found in lung, kidneys, liver, adrenals, spleen, pancreas, and salivary glands. After oral administration, the highest concentration occurred in the liver and kidneys. With the exception of plasma and liver, unchanged bisoprolol was the major radioactive constituent in all tissues studied. Both the blood-brain and placental barriers were penetrated, but only to a small degree. No accumulation of radioactivity in tissues was observed after repeated dosing (1 mg/kg/day). The metabolism of bisoprolol was studied in the same three animal species and in humans. The major metabolites are the products of O-dealkylation and subsequent oxidation to the corresponding carboxylic acids. The amount of bisoprolol excreted unchanged in the urine is 50-60% of the dose in humans, 30-40% in dogs, and approximately 10% in rats and monkeys.", 
    "73": "Bisoprolol, (+/-)1-(4-[(2-isopropoxyethoxy)-methyl]-phenoxy)-3-isopropyl-amino -2- propanol-hemifumarate, is a new, highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and low to moderate local anaesthetic activity. As demonstrated in binding experiments, and in classical pharmacological studies using rats, guinea pigs, cats, and dogs, bisoprolol markedly differentiated between beta 1-adrenoceptors of the heart, or the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus, and the beta 2-subtype in arterial blood vessels, bronchi, liver, or skeletal muscle. Up to concentrations nearly 100-fold higher than the therapeutic plasma levels in humans, bisoprolol did not affect the functional refractory period of the heart, and was devoid of a direct suppressive effect on myocardial contractility and of calcium antagonistic properties in heart and vascular muscle. The pattern of haemodynamic effects of bisoprolol was typical of beta-blockers and included decreases in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output, concomitant with an increase in calculated total peripheral resistance. In contrast to other beta-blockers, bisoprolol increased renal blood flow in anaesthetized dogs. Bisoprolol lowered BP in hypertensive dogs and rats, attenuated the development of spontaneous hypertension in rats, decreased plasma renin activity and protected the heart from the sequelae of transient ischemia. It did not block presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in blood vessels. Serum lipids and the serum lipoprotein profile remained unaltered after bisoprolol. Bisoprolol was devoid of affinity for autonomic receptors other than beta-adrenoceptors or for autacoid receptors. This is probably one of the reasons why bisoprolol did not affect the function of the central nervous, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems in an obvious way. The high beta 1-selectivity of bisoprolol is linked with extremely favourable pharmacokinetic properties. These include nearly complete enteral absorption and virtual absence of liver first-pass metabolism, both resulting in high bioavailability, long plasma half-life, pharmacokinetics that are linear over a wide dose range and independent of age, food intake and hydroxylator status, low plasma protein binding, and a 1:1 ratio of hepatic metabolization to renal elimination of the unaltered substance. This sum of favourable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties characterize bisoprolol as an optimized beta-blocker.", 
    "74": "The effectiveness and safety of bisoprolol, a newly developed beta-adrenergic blocking drug, in the treatment of arrhythmias were evaluated in 17 patients with premature ventricular contraction (PVC), 8 with premature atrial contraction (PAC) and 7 with sinus tachycardia. More than 50% reduction of the PVC frequency was observed in 7 out of 16 patients. PVC was reduced in 2 out of 5 patients at a daily dose of 2.5 mg. The PAC frequency was decreased in 50% of the patients, and sinus tachycardia was improved in all 7 patients. Adverse reactions were observed in 8 of 32 patients. This preliminary study suggests that the antiarrhythmic effects of bisoprolol could be assessed starting at a daily dose of 2.5 mg to determine its optimal effective dose in Japanese patients.", 
    "75": "The acute electrophysiologic effects of 10 mg bisoprolol (B, given intravenously) were evaluated during an electrophysiological study in 10 patients with a history of paroxysmal tachycardia. Drug administration resulted in a significant decrease of sinus rate (Control [C]; 70.8/min; B: 59.4), and in an increase in sinus node recovery time (+20%). AV-nodal depression was marked at high heart rates during incremental atrial pacing. A second-degree AV-block occurred at a pacing cycle length (CL) of 329 ms (182/min) before and at a CL of 378 ms (158/min) after drug administration. Depression of AV-nodal conduction was negligible at low heart rates; the AH-interval at sinus rhythm was not affected (C: 84 ms, B: 86 ms); and functional and effective refractory periods of the AV-node were only slightly prolonged. Conduction intervals and refractory periods on atrial and ventricular level did not change. In 5 of 6 patients with accessory AV-pathways, circus movement tachycardia (CMT) could be elicited prior to as well as after B. Due to AV-nodal delay, CMT CL was slightly prolonged after B. Echozone and refractoriness of accessory pathways were not affected. In 1 of 2 patients with ectopic atrial tachycardia, B prevented the induction of paroxysms. In one patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the ventricular response decreased from 128/min to 94/min. The findings suggest that the electrophysiologic effects of B are due to a selective beta-adrenergic antagonism. Therapeutic efficacy is only to be expected if an increased adrenergic drive is a prerequisite for induction and continuation of a tachycardia.", 
    "76": "This report summarizes the most important results of 11 studies regarding efficacy and safety of bisoprolol in patients with stable angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease. Assessments carried out 2-3 h after the administration of the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocking agent bisoprolol revealed that the dose of 10 mg produced maximum effects in terms of improvement of exercise capacity (W X min) and reduction of ST segment depression at peak exercise. Duration of action was maintained over 24 h after administration of 5 and 10 mg bisoprolol. Thus, the data indicate no relevant loss of effect 24 h after single or repeated administration of 5-20 mg/day. Open uncontrolled long-term studies over 1 year demonstrated that bisoprolol in the dose range of 5-20 mg once daily is safe and highly effective. The evaluation was based on the bisoprolol effects on bicycle exercise tests, weekly anginal attack rates, the incidence of untoward side effects, and clinical routine laboratory investigations.", 
    "77": "Bisoprolol exhibits a high absolute bioavailability (90%) because of its nearly complete absorption (greater than 90%) and small first-pass effect (10%). Bioavailability is independent of food intake. A long plasma-elimination half-life (10-11h) allows a once-a-day dose regimen. Because of the low plasma protein-binding (30%), kinetics are insensitive to protein-binding interactions. The balanced clearance (equieffective hepatic and renal clearance) renders the kinetics virtually insensitive to renal or hepatic insufficiency. Even in the case of complete failure of one clearance organ, the plasma elimination half-life of bisoprolol would only double. The metabolites that are inactive and do not accumulate are eliminated predominantly by the kidneys. There is no stereoselective metabolism. The metabolism of bisoprolol is insensitive to liver enzyme inhibition (cimetidine), and nearly insensitive to liver enzyme induction (rifampicin). The metabolism is independent of genetic oxidation-polymorphism (debrisoquine). The pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol are independent of the dose in the range from 2.5 to 100 mg. There is no age or sex dependency. Bisoprolol exhibits predictable pharmacokinetics with well-balanced properties leading to small intra- and interindividual variability of the plasma concentration time curves and pharmacokinetic parameters. Bisoprolol is the beta-blocker with LADME(liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination)-optimized pharmacokinetics. This is a prerequisite for therapeutic reliability.", 
    "78": "Efficacy and safety of the new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bisoprolol, in treatment of stable angina pectoris were studied in 36 patients using two types of single-blind design. After 2 weeks of therapy with bisoprolol in doses of 5 mg to 10 mg a day, exercise duration and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were significantly prolonged in 7 out of 10 patients who had a positive treadmill exercise test before bisoprolol. Bisoprolol significantly reduced heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and rate-pressure product (RPP) at peak exercise, which would account for the beneficial effect of bisoprolol on exercise tolerance. Bisoprolol also produced improvement in symptoms for 26 patients with stable effort angina, as indicated by decreased frequency of anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption with a once-a-day regimen. Ten patients had no attacks after 5 mg of bisoprolol, and three more did not develop angina after increasing the dose to 10 mg a day. These results suggest that bisoprolol will be a promising, efficacious, and safe drug for the treatment of stable angina pectoris.", 
    "79": "The efficacy of once-daily bisoprolol (10 mg) and atenolol (100 mg) was assessed in 19 patients with stable angina, using a double-blind randomized crossover protocol and computer-assisted treadmill exercise testing with continuous monitoring of leads CM5 and CC5, the test being carried out 22-24 h after the last dose. The mean +/- SEM exercise time on placebo was 6.5 +/- 0.4 min increasing to 7.8 +/- 0.5 min on bisoprolol (p less than 0.02) and 8.6 +/- 0.6 min on atenolol (p less than 0.001). The increase in exercise time with atenolol was significantly greater than with bisoprolol (p less than 0.02). The time to 1 mm ST-depression in CM5 and CC5 was also prolonged significantly with both drugs compared to placebo, but with no difference between the two active treatments. The mean resting heart rate of 84 +/- 4 beats/min decreased to 63 +/- 2 beats/min on bisoprolol (p less than 0.001) and 64 +/- 2 beats/min on atenolol (p less than 0.001) with a significant decrease in the peak exercise heart rate seen with both drugs (p less than 0.001). The peak rate-pressure product (beats/min X mm Hg X 10(-2)) was 175 +/- 8 after placebo, 146 +/- 7 (p less than 0.001) after bisoprolol and 149 +/- 5 (p less than 0.01) after atenolol. One patient was withdrawn because he suffered a myocardial infarction. After completion of the crossover phase, 18 of the patients were prescribed bisoprolol 10 mg once a day for 6 weeks. Twelve patients were treated for 12 weeks. An exercise test was performed at the end of each 6-week period. The effects of bisoprolol on all parameters were maintained. In conclusion, bisoprolol is an effective antianginal agent, comparable in efficacy and duration of action with atenolol, and is suitable for once daily administration.", 
    "80": "Twelve patients with stable angina pectoris due to coronary heart disease received single oral doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg bisoprolol in a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study. A significant, dose-related increase in exercise tolerance in symptom-limited bicycle exercise tests performed 2.5 h after administration (p less than 0.05) was demonstrated. The dose-effect relationship was especially marked in reduction of heart rate, rate-pressure product, and ischemic ST-segment depression at the highest comparable workload (p less than 0.01). Compared with placebo, mean improvements in work performance (determined by the maximal workload attained, i.e., W X minutes) increased to 105% with 5 mg, to 122% with 10 mg, and to 131% with 20 mg bisoprolol. The lower incidence rate of exercise-induced symptoms of angina pectoris at an identical workload was marked at the 10- and 20-mg dose.", 
    "81": "The antihypertensive effect and possible adverse effects of bisoprolol were assessed in 96 Japanese patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a 2- to 4-week placebo period, bisoprolol was administered to 68 outpatients at a daily dose of 5 mg to 20 mg for 6 to 8 weeks, and to 28 inpatients with the same dose range up to a maximum of 4 weeks. For outpatients, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every 2 weeks, while for inpatients, in addition to daily measurements, the effect of bisoprolol on diurnal variation of blood pressure was also studied. Bisoprolol lowered blood pressure and heart rate significantly in both groups of patients. The most common adverse effect was bradycardia. It is expected that bisoprolol will be a very effective and useful antihypertensive drug.", 
    "82": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of continuous therapy with bisoprolol on blood pressure, serum lipids, and HDL-cholesterol over a period of 10 months following an initial 3-month titration and short-term treatment period. The results of the short-term study have been presented in a separate report. Forty-two patients entered into this long-term study, and 41 of them completed the 10-month treatment period. The mean supine blood pressure was 134/85 mm Hg at the end of the short-term study and was maintained at 137/85 mm Hg after 10 months on bisoprolol. At the end of the study, all patients but one had a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with a dose of 2.5-40 mg bisoprolol. Three of the patients required concomitant use of hydrochlorothiazide to keep this pressure level. A small but statistically significant increase in serum triglycerides was observed from the start of the titration period to the end of the long-term study. Within each study, the changes were not significant. No significant changes were observed for total cholesterol, or for low density lipoprotein (LDL)- or high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. The side effects were rare and the usual for beta-blockers."
