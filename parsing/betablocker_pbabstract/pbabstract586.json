Zinc ions are able to stabilise interferon beta in E. coli probably by inhibiting the action of cell internal proteinase(s) which affect the half-life of this foreign protein. As a result up to one order of magnitude more active IFN-beta can be detected in Zn2+-treated E. coli cells.", 
    "1": "The noradrenergic (NE) innervation of the cerebellar cortex is sparse, forming a broad plexus of radially oriented axons distributing throughout the granular and molecular layers. Autoradiographic studies of beta-adrenergic receptor distribution in the rat show the greatest density of silver grains in the molecular layer (Palacios and Kuhar, '82). In the course of studies of NE hyperinnervated structures, we found that beta receptors are nonhomogeneously distributed in the Purkinje cell layer, where they occur in \"patches\" overlying small groups of Purkinje cell somata. Tissue sections were incubated in 10 pM 125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP), which binds equally to beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors. Nonspecific binding was determined in sections incubated in 125ICYP and 1 microM dl-propranolol. Beta-adrenergic receptor patches are of irregular size and are most prominent in the vermis of lobules I-IX, although the medial cerebellar hemispheres also show areas of increased silver grains over Purkinje cells. In order to determine the subtype of beta receptors, adjacent sections were incubated with either 125ICYP and the beta 2-selective antagonist IPS-339, or 125ICYP and the beta 1-selective antagonist practolol. Patches were observed after each incubation procedure, indicating that they are composed of both beta1 and beta2 receptors. Patches are observed in normal animals and also in rats in which cerebellar NE content was increased 165% by neonatal treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine. This treatment does not alter the density of beta receptors. The cerebellar elements in which the beta receptors are located is not known. While silver grains accumulate over small groups of Purkinje cell somata, they are not coextensive with these cell bodies. The distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors does not parallel the arrangement of noradrenergic varicosities in the rat cerebellar cortex.", 
    "2": "Forskolin, a potent activator of adenylate cyclase, and isoprenaline, an unselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, were studied in vitro on tissues from guinea-pig with respect to relaxation of the carbachol-contracted trachea, increase in the force of contraction of the papillary muscle and depression of subtetanic contractions of the soleus muscle, three well-characterized beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects. Forskolin and isoprenaline relaxed the trachea and increased the force of contraction of the papillary muscle. Isoprenaline but not forskolin caused a depression of the subtetanic contraction of the soleus muscle. Forskolin did not seem to potentiate the effects of isoprenaline on the tissues studied; the combined effects appeared to be a mere addition. Forskolin did not increase the efficacy of the partial agonist prenalterol either. It is concluded that there is no simple relation between c-AMP generation and the functional response to beta-adrenoceptor agonists. Forskolin should not be used uncritically to probe beta-adrenoceptor-mediated effects.", 
    "3": "A dose dependent increase in the ciliary beat frequency of rat tracheal explants was found over a 10(-7)-10(-3) M concentration range of (+/-)-isoprenaline and was abolished by 10(-7) M propranolol. Furthermore (+)-isoprenaline, a drug which is much less potent in its action on beta-adrenoceptors than its (-)-isomer, failed to cause a stimulation. We conclude that the acceleration in the intrinsic ciliary beat frequency by (-)-isoprenaline, although occurring at a relatively high concentration compared with the action of the drug on other tissues, is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "4": "RU 24969 and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) inhibited the specific binding of [3H]5-HT (2 nM) to rat brain membranes with shallow displacement curves. The displacement data were best fitted with a model of two independent, high and low affinity binding sites. Following addition of spiperone (1 microM) as a selective ligand for the putative 5-HT1A recognition site of [3H]5-HT, the displacement curve of RU 24969 underwent a leftward shift, whereas spiperone induced a shift to the right for the displacement curve of 8-OH-DPAT. In contrast to spiperone, pindolol (1 microM) shifted the displacement curve of RU 24969 to the right. These results suggest that RU 24969 possesses preference for the purported 5-HT1B subtype of central 5-HT1 recognition site. The reported significant linear correlation between hypotensive activity following intravenous (i.v.) administration to anesthetized rats and affinity for the central 5-HT1 binding site could only be maintained by incorporation of the affinity of RU 24969 for its low and 8-OH-DPAT for its high affinity binding site. Based on the proposal that the 5-HT1A site corresponds to the high affinity site of 8-OH-DPAT and the low affinity site of RU 24969, it is hypothesized that the late depressor phase of 5-HT agonists in rats is mediated by activation of peripheral (vascular) 5-HT receptors which have similarities with the 5-HT1A subtype of central 5-HT1 recognition site.", 
    "5": "The effects of two nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, additionally endowed with vasodilating properties with different mechanisms: labetalol which blocks alpha-adrenoceptors, and bucindolol which nonspecifically relaxes vascular smooth muscle, were investigated on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) distribution in ischemic and nonischemic areas and on ST-segment elevation in ischemic areas during intermittent coronary artery occlusion in dogs. Both labetalol and bucindolol reduced heart rate, arterial blood pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption. However, they did not affect coronary vascular resistance and did not induce any favorable coronary blood flow redistribution phenomenon either from the epicardium to the endocardium or from the nonischemic to the ischemic areas. These results indicate that the inability of labetalol and bucindolol to favorably redistribute RMBF was due to the fact that their vasodilating properties counteract one major determinant of RMBF redistribution. i.e. the beta-adrenoceptor blockade-induced increase in regional coronary vascular resistance. Finally, both labetalol and bucindolol dose dependently decreased ST-segment elevation in ischemic myocardial areas.", 
    "6": "A protease that can be inhibited by glutathione, dithiothreitol, and o-phenanthroline but not by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid converts the 50-kilodalton beta-adrenergic receptor in turkey erythrocyte membranes to a 40-kDa polypeptide which retains the specific ligand binding site. This conversion is attenuated in intact erythrocytes. The large 50-kDa peptide contains N-linked, complex carbohydrates and is retained on wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose. The 40-kDa product of proteolysis does not bind to the wheat germ agglutinin and can thus be separated from the 50-kDa polypeptide by lectin chromatography. However, the large difference in molecular weights of the two receptor peptides cannot be accounted for solely by the different extent of glycosylation.", 
    "7": "The rate of fatty acid synthesis in interscapular brown adipose tissue of female cold-adapted rats, as measured by the incorporation of 3H from 3H2O into tissue lipid, was decreased by about 70% after injection of noradrenaline. There was a similar decrease in the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. In contrast, the proportion of pyruvate dehydrogenase in its active non-phosphorylated form was greatly increased after injection of noradrenaline. This finding suggests that the oxidation of glucose may be important in noradrenaline-induced thermogenesis in rat brown adipose tissue.", 
    "8": "A highly sensitive method for the determination of propafenone in plasma has been established using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the deuterium-labelled compound as an internal standard. Plasma levels as low as 1 ng/ml were measured using 0.5-ml plasma samples. Plasma protein binding of the drug in rats, dogs and humans in vitro and in vivo was determined by the proposed method. About 90% of the drug was bound to the plasma protein in all species in vitro (20-500 ng/ml) and 69-88% in rats, 90-95% in dogs and 77-89% in humans after oral administration of the drug at doses of 50 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 200 mg per person, respectively.", 
    "9": "In some systems, such as the turkey erythrocyte, agonist-promoted phosphorylation of the beta-adrenergic receptor appears to be associated with desensitization of the adenylate cyclase system. This process can be partially mimicked by cyclic AMP analogs. Accordingly, we have investigated the phosphorylation of the pure mammalian beta-adrenergic receptor by the pure catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The beta-adrenergic receptor, purified from hamster lung to apparent homogeneity, contains a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 64,000. The receptor can be phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (approximately 2 mol of phosphate (on serine residues) per mol). Isoproterenol, a beta-agonist, promoted a 2-3-fold increase in the rate of receptor phosphorylation which was blocked by the beta-antagonists propranolol and alprenolol. High performance liquid chromatographic tryptic peptide mapping reveals two major phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylated receptor can be completely dephosphorylated by a high molecular weight phosphoprotein phosphatase. The rate of receptor dephosphorylation is enhanced 2-3-fold by isoproterenol and this effect is blocked by alprenolol. The functional significance of receptor phosphorylation was examined using ligand binding and reconstitution techniques. While the binding of isoproterenol and alprenolol to the receptor was unaffected by phosphorylation, the ability of the receptor to interact with the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, as assessed by isoproterenol-promoted GTPase activity, was decreased 24 +/- 1% (mean +/- S.E., p less than 0.001, n = 17). The quantitative extent of receptor phosphorylation and functional impairment are virtually identical to those previously observed when intact turkey erythrocytes were incubated with cyclic AMP. These data provide a direct demonstration of regulation of the function of the isolated beta-adrenergic receptor by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.", 
    "10": "Chronic treatment with propranolol for 6 weeks resulted in a 16.6% increase, over the level in control rats, in myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor density as measured by [3H]prazosin binding. The apparent affinity remained unaffected. No changes were observed in beta-adrenoceptor density and apparent affinity as measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. It is concluded that myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptors might have a compensatory role under conditions where beta-adrenergic effects are attenuated.", 
    "11": "The early-morning increase in insulin requirements of patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) has been referred to as the \"dawn phenomenon.\" To determine the roles of growth hormone levels and sympathoadrenal activity in this phenomenon, we studied six subjects with IDDM on four occasions during a constant overnight infusion of insulin. In control experiments (infusion of insulin alone), plasma glucose increased from 98 +/- 5 mg per deciliter at midnight to 225 +/- 36 at 8:00 a.m. (P less than 0.001), glucose production increased by 65 per cent (P less than 0.001), and glucose clearance decreased by 50 per cent (P less than 0.001). When nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion were prevented by infusion of somatostatin plus replacement glucagon, neither plasma glucose levels nor glucose production increased significantly, and glucose clearance did not decrease. When nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion were simulated by hourly intravenous injections of growth hormone (15 to 100 micrograms) during infusion of somatostatin and glucagon, plasma glucose levels and glucose production increased and glucose clearance decreased to values observed in control experiments. During combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine and propranolol), values for plasma glucose, glucose production, and glucose utilization were not significantly different from those in control experiments. Increases in plasma glucose were significantly correlated with peak plasma growth hormone concentrations (r = 0.58, P less than 0.01). We conclude that nocturnal surges in growth hormone secretion are primarily responsible for the dawn phenomenon in patients with IDDM.", 
    "12": "The cysteine residue at position 148 in the lactose carrier protein of Escherichia coli has been replaced by serine using oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis of the lac Y gene. The mutant carrier is incorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane to the same extent as the wild-type carrier, confers a lactose-positive phenotype on cells, and actively transports lactose and other galactosides. However, the maximum rate of transport for several substrates is reduced by a factor of 6-10 while the apparent affinity is reduced by a factor of 2-4. Carrier activity in the mutant is much less sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents (HgCl2, p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonate and N-ethylmaleimide) than in the wild type, and beta-D-galactosyl 1-thio-beta-D-galactoside does not protect the mutant carrier against slow inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide. It is concluded that the Cys148 residue is not essential for carrier-catalyzed galactoside: proton symport and that its alkylation presumbly prohibits access of the substrate to the binding site by steric hindrance. A serine residue at position 148 in the amino acid sequence appears to alter the protein structure in such a way that one or more sulfhydryl groups elsewhere in the protein become accessible to alkylating agents thereby inhibiting transport. Recently, Trumble et al. [(1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 119, 860-867] arrived at similar conclusions by investigating a mutant carrier with a Cys148----Gly148 replacement.", 
    "13": "The intravenous and oral dose kinetics of propranolol were studied in the dog both in a fasted state and immediately after a meal consisting of 100 g of cooked beef liver. Fifty microCi of 3H-propranolol was administered intravenously simultaneously with a 40-mg oral dose of unlabeled propranolol. Plasma 3H-propranolol was measured by specific extraction and liquid scintillation spectrometry, and unlabeled plasma propranolol was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Feeding significantly reduced (25%) the elimination half-life and increased (52%) the systemic clearance of intravenous propranolol. The increase in the systemic clearance of propranolol after feeding was mostly due to an increase (60%) in apparent hepatic blood flow, which appeared to remain elevated for 5-7 hr. The meal had no influence on the apparent volume of distribution or plasma binding. Feeding did not affect the area under the concentration-time curve of oral propranolol, but significantly delayed the rate of oral propranolol absorption, shifting the time to reach peak plasma levels from 60 to 158 min. The results of this study suggest that feeding alters the disposition of propranolol in the dog by producing a sustained increase in hepatic blood flow.", 
    "14": "Two antiglaucoma drugs were tested on Hubbard chicks with light-induced avian glaucoma (LIAG). This animal model for open-angle glaucoma was further assessed by a novel method for monitoring aqueous inflow and outflow simultaneously. When the chicks were 8 to 9 weeks of age the preglaucomatous eyes were significantly enlarged (p less than 0.001), weighing a mean of 3.37 g, compared with 2.59 g for a group of normal eyes, but the intraocular pressure (IOP) was slightly lower in the former (13.79 v. 16.46 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). At this age the aqueous outflow was markedly reduced (to 0.70 v. 2.47 microL/min; p less than 0.05), but no change in aqueous inflow could be demonstrated. By 18 to 20 weeks the glaucomatous eyes were further enlarged (mean weight 4.67 v. 3.76 g; p less than 0.001) and hypertensive (mean IOP 29.85 v. 22.27 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). Timolol elicited a 29% to 33% reduction in the IOP at 8 to 9 weeks in both groups of eyes. At 18 to 20 weeks it reduced the IOP of the glaucomatous eyes to normal values but caused a less marked reduction in the normal eyes. Pilocarpine elicited an initial sharp rise in the IOP but was ultimately hypotensive, causing about a 33% decrease from the preinfusion IOP, in both young and adult birds.", 
    "15": "The authors report on comparative studies of two beta-blockers with regard to various parameters (intraocular pressure, perfusion pressure, and brightness of the papilla). A differential evaluation of these medications shows that measurement of the intraocular pressure alone is not sufficient to elucidate all of their characteristics fully.", 
    "16": "The data are provided on the efficacy of the use of the beta-adrenoblocker inderal and the natural antioxidant vitamin E as agents that prevent the immobilization stress-induced depression of the activity of natural killers. The problems of the prevention of the action of excess catecholamines and activation of lipid peroxidation as pathogenetic component in the development of stressor depression of the activity of natural killers are discussed.", 
    "17": "Many authors have shown that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often associated with diastolic abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of propranolol on left ventricular isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) measured by echocardiography in 20 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy under basal conditions and under increasing doses of propranolol (160 mg, 320 mg, and 480 mg per day) and in two control groups, 10 patients with aortic stenosis, and 10 normal subjects. IVRT was less than 50 msec in all normal subjects, while it was always above this limit in aortic stenosis (77 msec +/- 8, p less than 0.001), and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (94 msec +/- 19, p less than 0.001), with also a significant difference between these two last groups (p less than 0.01). Under increasing doses of propranolol, relaxation time often shortens gradually until 50 msec or less. These results show an improvement in left ventricular relaxation dependent on the propranolol dosage and often a normalization at high dosages.", 
    "18": "Cardiovascular alterations in hypo- and hyperthyroidism have been ascribed to changes of noradrenergic neurotransmission. In the present study the influence of thyroid hormones on adrenoceptors in the rat heart was further characterized. The effect of artificial hypothyroidism (induced by feeding 6-propyl-2-thiouracil, PTU) and hyperthyroidism (induced by daily injections of triiodothyronine, T3) on myocardial adrenoceptor binding, catecholamines, some physiological responses, and their interdependence was examined. The density of myocardial beta-adrenergic binding sites (3H-dihydroalprenolol, 3H-DHA) was reduced after PTU (by 38%) and enhanced after T3 treatment (by up to 82%). The increase was dose- and time-dependent and reversible within 4 days. No changes of the affinity of 3H-DHA to its binding sites were observed. Only L-T3 and L-T4 proved to be active, D-T3 and reverse T3 had no effect. The rise in beta-adrenoceptor density caused by T3 was prevented by concomitant administration of cycloheximide, indicating its dependence on protein synthesis. The density of myocardial alpha 1-adrenergic binding sites (3H-prazosin) was significantly reduced in the PTU group (by up to 28%) and even more distinctly by T3 treatment (by up to 50%). KD values remained unaltered. The noradrenaline content and turnover of rat hearts was significantly reduced by T3-induced hyperthyroidism. PTU treatment had no influence on content and turnover of noradrenaline. Plasma noradrenaline as well as adrenaline levels in freely moving rats were increased by PTU treatment 9- and 5-fold, respectively. In T3-injected animals no significant changes were measured. The density of adrenoceptors is known to be inversely correlated with catecholamine levels in several organs. Neither alpha- nor beta-adrenoceptor changes in the myocardium of dysthyroid rats could be attributed to such a homologous regulation, since they still occurred after chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine and adrenalectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Rat hypothalamic slices were incubated with 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine and superfused in the presence of paroxetine to inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake. The slices were continuously stimulated electrically with rectangular pulses at varying frequencies. Continuous stimulation for up to 42 min at 1 Hz or at 3 Hz evoked a steady efflux of tritium that slowly decayed with time. The efflux produced by continuous stimulation at 5 Hz declined more rapidly with time. Continuous stimulation at 1 Hz in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabelled 5-HT produced a concentration-dependent decrease in tritium efflux. The presence of methiothepin (0.5 mumol/l), quipazine (10 mumol/l) and (-)- but not (+)-propranolol (1 mumol/l) attenuated this response to 5-HT. From these data, the apparent pA2 values were calculated and found to be in agreement with published values. Frequency-dependent responses were determined using a \"cumulative stimulation\" protocol whereby the slices were subjected to three consecutive 14 min periods of stimulation at increasing frequencies (1, 3 and then 5 Hz). Unlabelled 5-HT (1 mumol/l) inhibited electrically-evoked tritium efflux more at 1 than at 5 Hz. Methiothepin (0.5 mumol/l) and quipazine (10 mumol/l) enhanced the stimulated efflux in a manner inversely related to the frequency of stimulation. Neither (+)- nor (-)-propranolol enhanced stimulated tritium efflux at any of the three frequencies tested. It is concluded that continuous electrical stimulation of rat hypothalamic slices at a low frequency provides a rapid means of obtaining apparent affinities and intrinsic activities of drugs that modify the serotonergic autoreceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Ocular blood flow was measured in aphakic rabbit eyes using a radioactive microsphere technique following sub-chronic three times a day treatment with one of the following drugs: ecothiophate iodide (0.125%), pilocarpine (4%), epinephrine (2%), norepinephrine (2%) or timolol (0.5%). The results show that regional ocular blood flow was statistically normal after this treatment regimen compared to both normal and aphakic control eyes. Ecothiophate did statistically increase choroidal blood flow and, although not statistically significant, other drugs did induce trends which may be relevant to drug use.", 
    "21": "The effect of propranolol on cardiac patients undergoing exercise training is reported to increase exercise tolerance and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2 max) but its effect on anaerobic threshold (AT) is unknown. It was the purpose of this study to determine the role of exercise training with propranolol on AT in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Eight men and one woman with significant (CAD) were selected for this study. Each patient completed a maximum treadmill stress test (MTST) following the Bruce protocol on propranolol 40-160 mg/day as a control study. Cardiorespiratory variables were measured at rest and at each stage of the treadmill test. These patients underwent an exercise training programme for 12-16 weeks on the same dose of propranolol. Training sessions were for a minimum of 30-40 minutes, 3 times a week, with training heart rate of 75%-85% of the pretraining peak heart rate. Training heart rate ranged from 98 to 128 beats/min. They were retested with a MTST after the training programme, on the same dose of propranolol. AT was calculated noninvasively by measuring respiratory variables every 30 seconds in relation to work increment. AT was identified by measuring the time course of VE, VCO2, VE/VO2, etc. in relation to incremental work. The mean values of VO2, O2P and % VO2 max at AT before and after training on propanolol were as follows: VO2 = 1.43 L/min +/- .25 and 1.86 L/min +/- .44, O2P = 14.35 +/- 2.40 and 18.73 +/- 4.00 ml/beat, % of VO2 max = 68.20 +/- 6.31 and 73.59 +/- 5.84. The mean changes of VO2 O2P, and % of VO2 max were + 0.43 L/min +/- 0.20 (P < .003), + 4.38 +/- 2.55 (P < .003) and +/- 5.07% +/- 4.84 (P < .001). After exercise training on propanolol, the mean peak exercise tolerance time and absolute VO2 max increased by 2.8 min (from 9.0 to 11.8 min) (P < .001) and 22.7% (P < .007), respectively. We conclude that the increase in anaerobic threshold in patients with coronary artery disease may be due to improvement in VO2 max, increased stroke volume, and peripheral O2 extraction.", 
    "22": "Twenty-eight samples of human liver have been characterised for cytochrome P-450 content, aldrin epoxidase, debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase and bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase activities. Evidence is presented here and elsewhere that bufuralol 1'-hydroxylase and debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase are activities catalysed by the same form of cytochrome P-450 in man, and that this form is different from that catalysing the epoxidation of aldrin. Attempts to phenotype liver samples in vitro, in the absence of any metabolic data in vivo for debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation status, met with limited success. A combination of enzyme assays will most probably be required in any such phenotyping of human liver samples.", 
    "23": "The haemodynamic tolerance of intravenous acebutolol was evaluated during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. This is a beta-blocker with an intrinsic beta-stimulant effect. The study consisted of 14 patients (10 cases of inferior infarction and 4 cases of anterior infarction) with a mean capillary pressure of less than 20 mmHg and a cardiac index greater than 2 l X min-1 X m-2. The minimal dose of acebutolol was 0.05 mg X kg-1 X h-1 and the maximal dose was 0.125 mg X kg-1 X h-1. The intravenous infusion of acebutolol was commenced between 3 and 12 hours (average: 7.5 hours) after the infarction and was continued for 48 hours, at which time it was replaced by oral administration. The mean total intravenous dose was 409 mg (from 190 to 510 mg). Two patients were excluded from the protocol because of the development of 2nd degree atrioventricular block several minutes after the beginning of the infusion. The basal values of the cardiac index (2.7 l X min-1 X m-2 +/- 0.37), the mean capillary pressure (9.4 mmHg +/- 2.7) and the systolic index (38.3 ml/m2 +/- 6.4) did not change significantly during the infusion, in the 14 patients studied. The double product, heart rate x blood pressure, decreased from the mean basal value of 9,443 to 7,680 at 24 hours and to 7,000 at 48 hours (p less than 0.05). Acebutolol does not depress left ventricular function, provided that it is reserved for patients with class I or II disease according to Killip and Kimball's classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "This study was designed to improve our understanding of duodeno-pancreatic reflexes, the existence of which was suggested by the previous observation of a reduction in secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion during local anesthesia of the duodenal mucosa. The effects on this reduction in secretin-stimulated secretion of cholinergic or adrenergic blocking agents (alone or in combination) and of truncal vagotomy, were studied in conscious dog with gastric and pancreatic fistulae. For each agent and for secretin alone in normal and vagotomized dogs, a comparison was made of pancreatic secretion with and without lignocaine anesthesia of the duodenal mucosa. Lignocaine reduced pancreatic secretion with secretin alone, and stimulated it during infusion of atropine. The changes in both protein bicarbonate secretion were blocked by pentolinium and by phenoxybenzamine whereas propranolol mainly blocked the effects on bicarbonate output. The effect of truncal vagotomy resembled that of atropine. These results suggest the existence of two enteropancreatic reflex mechanisms; an excitory cholinergic vagal reflex and an inhibitory, atropine-resistant non-vagal reflex. Both are blocked by pentolinium (a ganglion blocker) and by phenoxy-benzamine, suggesting the involvement of alpha-adrenergic receptors probably also at the level of the ganglion cell. Beta-adrenergic receptors are also involved in the regulation of bicarbonate and fluid secretion.", 
    "25": "Maximal exercise capacity after control of resting blood pressure with labetalol was studied in nine hypertensive men aged 34 to 69 years (average 52 years). Subjects exercised to exhaustion on an upright cycle ergometer with workload increased as a step function by 25 watts every three minutes, both before and after control of blood pressure was obtained. Mean exercise capacity expressed as total time of exercise until exhaustion was 936 seconds prior to control of the resting blood pressure and 884 seconds (no significant difference) after control of resting blood pressure with labetalol. Double product at peak exercise fell from 254 X 10(2) mm Hg beats per minute prior to blood pressure control to 183 X 10(2) mm Hg beats per minute (p = 0.006) after control of blood pressure with labetalol. The difference in the means of resting heart rate and both peak blood pressure and peak heart rate with exercise were all statistically significant after control of blood pressure with labetalol. These findings suggest that labetalol has an ideal exercise profile affording a cardioprotective effect by decreasing double product but without sacrificing exercise capacity.", 
    "26": "Nine patients with tremor on writing and one patient with tremor only on swinging a golf club were investigated. None of the patients had any other neurological symptoms or signs. The frequency of the tremor ranged from 5 to 6 Hz. Rapid passive supination or pronation of the forearm by a torque motor evoked a short burst of alternating tremor in seven patients. The tremor was improved by alcohol or propranolol in six patients. These characteristics of writing tremor (and of other isolated action tremors) suggest that it is a variant of benign essential tremor.", 
    "27": "Little systematic information is available concerning the advantages and disadvantages of participation in a clinical trial from the patients' point of view. Surveys were undertaken among participants in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) and the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study (AMIS) to obtain data on these perceptions. In AMIS, an open-ended personal interview format was employed. For BHAT, a questionnaire partially based on hypotheses generated in AMIS, was mailed out. Results from the two studies suggested that patients in both trials felt that the additional medical monitoring, the opportunity for a \"second opinion,\" and the reassurance received were more important benefits than actual physical improvement. Altruistic motivations were high in both studies. Frequency of perceived disadvantages was low, centering mainly around transportation problems and clinic waiting time. The large majority of patients indicated that they would volunteer for similar research in the future. The results are discussed in the context of the available literature and of the possibilities for extensions of this line of research.", 
    "28": "The close-out of clinical trials that end ahead of schedule often involves problems that differ from those of trials that end as planned. The Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), a double-blind study of 3837 post-myocardial infarction patients, was a multicenter clinical trial that ended early because therapeutic benefit had been demonstrated. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP), a randomized unblinded study of 10,940 hypertensive individuals, was a multicenter trial that ended as planned. Using these trials as illustrations, the issues arising in multicenter trials that end ahead of schedule are contrasted to those that arise in trials that end as scheduled. Close-out activities that are discussed include documentation of close-out procedures, release of trial information, preparation of trial participants and staff, ascertaining vital status, continuing patient care, data collection and coding, and publication of trial results. Because of the possibility a study might end early, advance planning for close-out is essential.", 
    "29": "Five women who developed hypertension during pregnancy received metoprolol, 10 mg iv; 3 days later they received metoprolol, 100 mg by mouth. Blood and urine samples were collected after each dose. The same procedure was repeated 3 to 6 months after delivery. The apparent oral clearance of metoprolol during pregnancy exceeded that after pregnancy by a factor of 2 to 13. As a result, after oral dosing the peak plasma concentrations during pregnancy were only 12% to 55% those after delivery, and the plasma AUCs were reduced to the same extent. Oral bioavailability increased by a factor of 1.3 to 3.7 after pregnancy. Systemic clearance after pregnancy was 26% to 97% that during pregnancy, but this difference was not significant. Metoprolol plasma protein binding was the same on both study occasions. Our data cannot be explained by a change in gastrointestinal absorption, because the urinary recovery of metoprolol and its metabolites was slightly higher during pregnancy. It is concluded that the greater metoprolol clearance during pregnancy results from increased hepatic metabolism of the drug.", 
    "30": "The cumulation of propafenone and two of its metabolites, 5-hydroxypropafenone (5-OHP) and N-depropylpropafenone (NDPP), was examined in patients with frequent ventricular ectopy. After 2 weeks of propafenone therapy (300 mg twice a day), propafenone was discontinued and blood samples were drawn for 24 hours. The mean (+/- SD) steady-state concentrations of propafenone, 5-OHP, and NDPP were 1010 +/- 411, 174 +/- 113, and 179 +/- 93 ng/ml. The concentration ratios of 5-OHP/propafenone and NDPP/propafenone were 0.177 +/- 0.049 and 0.227 +/- 0.203. Plasma concentrations of 5-OHP and NDPP did not decay in a log-linear manner during the sampling period and thus estimates of their disappearance t1/2s were not possible. At 24 hours after propafenone dosing, concentrations of 5-OHP and NDPP were 63% +/- 37% and 50% +/- 21% of their mean steady-state levels. Our data indicate that these propafenone metabolites cumulate in the plasma during chronic oral propafenone therapy, and that their clinical role needs to be elucidated.", 
    "31": "Although congestive heart failure has been reported with the combination of a beta blocker and either verapamil or nifedipine, it has not previously been reported for combination therapy that includes diltiazem. The following case documents the occurrence of clinical congestive failure in a patient with baseline left ventricular dysfunction and severe angina pectoris. Although the patients had tolerated propranolol therapy for years without difficulty, and high-dose diltiazem monotherapy with an excellent clinical response, the combination of diltiazem and propranolol resulted in the development of congestive heart failure. Thus, although generally well tolerated, given the suitable scenario of reduced left ventricular function, the combination of diltiazem and a beta blocker may adversely affect left ventricular performance.", 
    "32": "To determine whether removal of the anterior hypothalamus would alter baroreflex activity, reflex inhibition of heart rate and renal nerve activity during pressor responses to intravenous phenylephrine was examined in rats with bilateral anterior hypothalamic lesions. Although there were no differences in basal blood pressure and heart rate 10 days after surgery, reflex bradycardia was significantly reduced in awake lesioned rats compared with sham-operated controls. The differences in reflex bradycardia were abolished by cholinergic blockade with atropine but unaltered by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Because attenuation of chronotropic reflexes by anterior hypothalamic lesions resembled that produced by cholinergic blockade, vagal inhibition must be at least partly responsible. Reflex bradycardia was still attenuated even in lesioned rats anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, but renal nerve activity was as inhibited as in sham-operated rats. These results suggest that the anterior hypothalamus participates in baroreflex regulation of heart rate by altering parasympathetic tone but without affecting cardiac or renal sympathetic nerve activity.", 
    "33": "The present experiments were designed to examine the reflex cardiovascular effects of intracoronary administration of acetylstrophanthidin in the conscious dog. Administration of 4 micrograms/kg of this agent into the left circumflex coronary artery increased left ventricular dP/dtmax but had no effect on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, renal resistance, or iliac resistance. The positive inotropic effects of acetylstrophanthidin were less under control conditions (+599 mmHg/s) than during bilateral cervical vagal cold block (+850 mmHg/s, P less than 0.05); however, interruption of vagal efferent influences (atropine) alone did not alter the contractile effects of acetylstrophanthidin. Interruption of sympathetic efferent influences on the heart with either the nicotinic ganglionic receptor antagonist, hexamethonium, or the beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, metoprolol, also augmented the inotropic effects of acetylstrophanthidin to a degree similar to that observed with vagal cold block. In contrast to the effects observed with acetylstrophanthidin, the inotropic effects of intracoronary administration of calcium gluconate were not altered by vagal cold block or any other conditions examined in this study. We conclude that interruption of vagal afferents results in an augmentation of the positive inotropic actions of acetylstrophanthidin and that this augmented inotropic effect can be accounted for by interruption of cardiac vagal afferent-mediated restraint on sympathetic outflow to the heart.", 
    "34": "The effects of atenolol on ventricular arrhythmias were evaluated in 25 men with significant ventricular ectopy. The patients received 2 weeks each of placebo, 50, 100, and 200 mg of oral atenolol. Efficacy was determined by weekly 24-hour Holter monitors. In 20 patients who completed the protocol, the frequency of total ventricular ectopic beats, ectopic couplets, and ventricular tachycardia was significantly decreased after treatment. The complexity of ventricular ectopy was also decreased as measured by the Lown grade and the proportion of hours in which multiform ectopic beats were present. A therapeutic response, defined as the minimum percentage reduction in ventricular arrhythmias to demonstrate an effect due to atenolol rather than spontaneous variation, was achieved in up to 70% of patients for total number of ectopic beats, 75% for ectopic couplets, and 73% for ventricular tachycardia beats. The results show that oral atenolol is an effective agent for the treatment for ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "35": "Patients with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis commonly have bleeding from varices. In patients with a total colectomy, ileal varices can be a site of bleeding in cases of portal hypertension. Proper diagnosis requires studying the venous phase of the mesenteric arteriogram to show ileal varices, and carefully inspecting the mucocutaneous region of the ileal stoma for venous bleeding sites. Bleeding from ileal varices can be managed by either local control or portal vein decompression.", 
    "36": "An assessment of the rhythmic characteristics of melatonin secretion in man and other species requires the determination of 24-h secretion profiles. Measurement of a major excreted metabolite would allow noninvasive study of pineal function, applicable in particular to pediatric and long term circadian rhythm studies. This report describes a simple and rapid RIA for 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate in human plasma and urine. Physiological studies revealed that both plasma and urinary levels of 6-hydroxymelatonin sulfate were closely related to plasma melatonin, and that the urinary 24-h rhythm was abolished by the beta 1-adrenergic anagonist atenolol.", 
    "37": "The factors controlling levels of peptidyl glycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) activity in its major tissue sources in the adult male rat were investigated by carrying out a variety of endocrine, pharmacological, and dietary manipulations. Levels of PAM activity and alpha MSH immunoactivity in the neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary gland rose and fell in parallel in rats treated with the dopamine antagonist haloperidol or the dopamine agonist bromocriptine, respectively. PAM activity in the anterior pituitary lobe was increased after adrenalectomy or castration and decreased after thyroidectomy or treatment with haloperidol. PAM activity in the submandibular gland was increased after treatment with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine and decreased after treatment with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Serum levels of PAM activity were unaltered after hypophysectomy, adrenalectomy, sialectomy, or castration, but rose after thyroidectomy and declined after treatment with the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine or phenoxybenzamine. Chronic dietary copper deficiency in rats resulted in increased PAM activity in homogenates of anterior pituitary lobe and submandibular gland assayed under optimized conditions; chronic dietary ascorbate deficiency in guinea pigs did not produce consistent changes in PAM activity in the tissues examined.", 
    "38": "The effects of naloxone, propranolol, or both on the release of creatine kinase (CK) from the isolated ischemic rat heart were studied. Naloxone at concentrations of 1.1 and 3.6 mmole liter-1 in the perfusate at a rate of 1-2 ml min-1 reduced the release of CK from the isolated ischemic rat heart during myocardial ischemia in a dose-dependent manner. Propranolol at a concentration of 7 mumole liter-1 in the perfusate also reduced the release of CK. Addition of naloxone (1.1 mmole liter-1) to propranolol further reduced the release of CK. The effect of the joint administration of the two drugs seemed to be additive.", 
    "39": "This study was undertaken to determine whether an effective antianginal treatment without tolerance development can be carried out with intermittent nitrate administration on a regimen with a single daily dose of 120 mg isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) in sustained-release form (SR), as well as whether the concomitant administration of 100 mg atenolol or 100 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine renders an additive antiischemic effect. In two independently performed investigations, the duration of action of a single dose of 120 mg ISDN SR was assessed after its initial administration in addition to the anti-ischemic effect during long-term treatment, each according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled protocol in a total of 15 patients with angiographically-documented coronary artery disease, stable angina pectoris and reproducible ST-segment depression during exercise. The test phases of four weeks each were separated by one week placebo phases. After completion of the study, for a further eight weeks, 120 mg ISDN SR was given together with 100 mg atenolol in the morning. Exercise testing was carried out after four weeks of treatment in a control period before and at two hours after administration of 120 mg ISDN SR with 100 mg atenolol as well as after another four weeks in a control period before and after concomitant administration of 120 mg ISDN SR, 100 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine in sustained release form.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "Psychosocial stressors are risk factors for sudden cardiac death. A theoretical model of the brain mechanism that links defined environmental events (stressors) to cardiac vulnerability (initiation of ventricular fibrillation) has been developed. In the model, a stressor event evokes a set of electrochemical responses in the frontal cortex. Depending on the state of acquisition of these electrochemical responses to the stressor, activity will or will not be initiated in the frontocortical-brainstem pathway. Activity in this pathway, either alone or in combination with myocardial ischemia, triggers a state of increased vulnerability of the heart to the initiation of ventricular fibrillation. Three independent interventions have been shown to prevent the initiation of ventricular fibrillation after acute coronary artery occlusion in the psychologically stressed pig: 1) learned behavioral adaptation to the stressor, 2) cryogenic blockade of the frontocortical-brainstem pathway, and 3) intracerebral (but not intravenous) injection of a beta-receptor blocking agent (levo-propranolol).", 
    "41": "Labetalol is a unique alpha- and beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking agent that has recently been approved for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. This agent lowers peripheral vascular resistance by vasodilatation with little or no effect on cardiac output. The method of administration of labetalol will be determined by the particular hypertensive emergency. Rapid reduction in blood pressure within 5 minutes follows the administration of a bolus injection of 1.0-2.0 mg/kg, whereas smaller minibolus injections of labetalol are associated with a more gradual reduction in blood pressure. Labetalol may also be administered by continuous incremental infusion for smooth control of blood pressure. The convenience and safety of labetalol makes this agent a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of hypertensive urgencies or emergencies.", 
    "42": "Chronic diuretic therapy in hypertensive patients may be associated with a reversible deterioration in glucose tolerance. There is evidence to suggest that beta-blocker monotherapy may cause a deterioration in glucose tolerance in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus but little information about the effects of chronic beta-blocker treatment in hypertensive patients with normal glucose metabolism. A prospective evaluation of the effects of propranolol monotherapy on glucose tolerance was performed in 13 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. One patient developed diabetes mellitus after 1 month of treatment. Of 11 patients, 4 had a 30% or greater increase in fasting glucose after 1 year of therapy and a significant increase in fasting, and 2-hour postglucose-load venous plasma glucose occurred in the 9 patients completing 18 months of treatment. Although the biologic significance of these changes is questionable, the development of hyperglycemia in a patient receiving beta blockers could represent a side effect of drug therapy.", 
    "43": "This paper reports a 200-week-long study of the efficacy of timolol maleate ophthalmic preparations. At centres across Canada 117 patients were studied according to a rigid protocol. Timolol maleate was shown to be an effective antiglaucomatous drug, maintaining the intraocular pressure below 22 mm Hg throughout the study in 137 (60%) of the 227 eyes. No clinically significant effect on the pulse rate or the mean perfusion pressure was demonstrated, and the medication was well tolerated, causing few side effects or adverse reactions.", 
    "44": "The anti-ischaemic activities of atenolol (200 mg) and diltiazem (240 mg) were compared in 23 patients undergoing retraining 4 weeks after a limited postero-inferior or anterior primary myocardial infarction. The patients, who had signs of residual ischaemia during stress with or without angina, were subjected to 3 exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer; a computer was used to analyze the results (Case-Marquette). The first test was performed under placebo, the second after randomized treatment with one of the two drugs and the third test after taking the other drug. The parameters evaluated were: total duration of the test, time of occurrence of a 1 mm ST-segment depression, maximal work load and total work performed, heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, heart rate X systolic arterial pressure product at rest and at submaximal and maximal stress, and ST depression at submaximal and maximal stress. The results showed that exertion was improved to the same degree by the two drugs, but atenolol had greater anti-ischaemic activity than diltiazem.", 
    "45": "Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels were measured radioimmunologically in 30 normal individuals subjected to antiorthostatic hypokinesia (at a - 15 degrees angle). Hormonal effects of some drugs (beta-blockers, trental, venotonics) were examined. The short-term antiorthostatic position was associated with a disordered hormonal control, reduced plasma aldosterone and enhanced plasma renin activity, as compared to the respective parameters of the reclining position. The use of beta-adreno-blockers alone or in combinations with other drugs decreases plasma renin activity in conditions of antiorthostatic hypokinesia which can be related to the inhibition of beta-adrenergic activity.", 
    "46": "Acebutolol is a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug possessing both partial agonist (intrinsic sympathomimetic) and membrane stabilising activity. In hypertension, it can be administered once or twice daily with equal effectiveness, and has been as effective at lowering blood pressure as propranolol, diuretics, and other beta-blocking drugs (metoprolol, labetalol and atenolol) and more effective than methyldopa. Acebutolol has a significantly smaller effect on resting heart rate than propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol, although direct comparisons with drugs with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity have yet to be undertaken. In both angina and arrhythmia, when administered twice daily it has been as effective as standard therapeutic agents. The side effect profile of acebutolol appears to be comparable to that of other cardioselective beta-blockers. Its relative cardio-selectivity, partial agonist and membrane stabilising activity, hydrophilicity, and considerable extrarenal excretion may offer advantages over some beta-blocking drugs in specific patients. Choosing a beta-blocking agent, however, should be made with a knowledge of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the various agents and careful consideration of how such properties may be of benefit to an individual patient.", 
    "47": "Efforts were made in the Beta Blocker Heart Trial (BHAT), a double-blind study of 3837 post-MI patients, to enhance visit adherence, a measure of compliance that is not subjective and can be easily monitored. Of the required visits, 93.9% were completed in the window, 3.9% of the patients were classified as dropouts and 12 persons were lost to follow-up. Methods used to enhance compliance varied with circumstances but included appointment reminders, assistance with transportation, minimal waiting times, newsletters, continuity of care, involvement of family members, and close contact with private physicians. Comparisons of the BHAT visit adherence rates to those from other clinical trials are difficult to make because there are few reports in the literature regarding follow-up in large multicenter clinical trials. However, data obtained through personal communications, as well as published reports, indicate that adherence in primary prevention trials was generally less than that of secondary prevention trials. Adherence rates in the BHAT tended to be slightly higher than those of comparable trials.", 
    "48": "The antihypertensive effects of labetalol infusion (2 mg/min; maximal dose 150 mg) were evaluated in 22 subjects requiring rapid lowering of blood pressure because of severe hypertension, a hypertensive crisis after surgery, or before angiographic examination. Overall systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced from 201 +/- 4 to 164 +/- 4 mm Hg and from 123 +/- 3 to 107 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively. By the end of the infusion, diastolic blood pressure in 16 (73%) subjects was lowered to less than or equal to 110 mm Hg. No adverse effects were encountered, but one subject had a transitory hypotensive episode that did not require treatment. Intravenous labetalol appears effective and well tolerated in the control of blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies.",

    "50": "Concurrent therapy with the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, and the beta-blocking group of compounds is usually felt to be clinically contraindicated due to the former's potent dromotropic and negative inotropic actions. The basis of this assumption was examined in a rest and exercise hemodynamic study of the effects of verapamil and the cardioselective beta-blocking drug, metoprolol, in 22 patients with stable angina pectoris and angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease. In a randomized study, 11 patients were assessed following intravenous verapamil (16 mg) alone, 11 following intravenous metoprolol (10 mg) alone, and all 22 were assessed on combination therapy. The plasma levels achieved at the time of each hemodynamic assessment were in the therapeutic range. At rest, verapamil alone significantly lowered systemic arterial pressure and vascular resistance; metoprolol alone lowered heart rate and increased systemic vascular resistance without change in systemic arterial pressure. Combination therapy reduced systemic arterial pressure and heart rate without change in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. During upright bicycle exercise, the changes were directionally similar. Depression of cardiac function (i.e., reduced cardiac output at increased pulmonary artery occluded pressure) occurred following metoprolol but not following verapamil; the addition of verapamil did not accentuate the depression of function induced by metoprolol. These results suggested that in patients with stable coronary artery disease, without manifest conduction system abnormality, the cardiac depressant actions of verapamil were countered by its vasodilator properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The portal venous system was studied by ultrasonography (US) in 18 patients with cirrhosis of the liver who had previous bleeding from large esophageal varices. Portal-tract pressure for ten of these patients also was measured by hepatic vein catheterization. After 21 days of treatment with atenolol, the calibers of their splanchnic veins decreased during expiration, while a response to breathing maneuvers was restored. The decrease in the caliber of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins seen by US appeared to correlate significantly with the decrease in portal pressure (P less than .05). Nonresponse to treatment also was detected by US. Real-time US may be routinely carried out as a noninvasive, easy-to-repeat technique for the study of portal system hypertension in patients with cirrhosis undergoing therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents.", 
    "52": "The effects of metoprolol treatment in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction have been investigated in a double-blind randomized study. The patients were stratified according to age, infarct size and type of ventricular arrhythmias before administration of metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily (n = 154), or placebo (n = 147). All patients were followed up for 36 months. There were 31 (29 cardiac) and 25 (20 cardiac) deaths in the placebo and metoprolol groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed a significant reduction of cardiac death in patients with a large infarct (32.1% with placebo versus 12.5% with metoprolol, p less than 0.05) as a result of active treatment. Sudden death rates were 14.7% in the placebo versus 5.8% in the metoprolol group (p less than 0.05). The incidence of nonfatal reinfarction was 21.1% in the placebo versus 11.7% in the metoprolol group (p less than 0.05). The reduction in nonfatal reinfarction was similar in all pretreatment risk strata. The difference between the two groups in cumulative number of cardiac deaths and patients experiencing nonfatal reinfarction increased throughout the study. Furthermore, cerebrovascular events (p less than 0.05) and coronary bypass surgery (p = 0.058) were more frequent in the placebo group. In conclusion, after 36 months of metoprolol treatment after myocardial infarction, there was a significant reduction of nonfatal reinfarction and sudden death in all patients and a reduction of cardiac death in those with a large infarct.",

    "54": "Glycogen phosphorylase activity was determined in rat livers obtained by laparotomy in thiobarbital (Inactin, PROMONTA) anaesthesia induced by injection of the drug via a polyethylene catheter into a jugular vein as described previously [N\u00e9meth et al. 1983a]. Intact rats and animals exposed to open field stress without or after i.p. injection of the alpha blocker phentolamine (Regitine, CIBA; 20 mg kg-1, 90 min before stress) or the beta blocker propranolol (Inderal, ICI; 2 mg kg-1, 30 min before stress) were studied. In stressed animals a net increase of phosphorylase activity was observed. This response was abolished after alpha blockade, while after beta blockade it was potentiated. In a further series on animals subjected to the same type of anaesthesia, the activating effect of immobilization stress on phosphorylase activity was confirmed in both fed and fasted animals, the response of the latter issuing from a lower initial level but being of the same extent as in the fed rats.", 
    "55": "A total of 127 patients with bronchial asthma of infectious-allergic genesis and chronic obstructive bronchitis were examined for the central and regional hemodynamics as well as for the blood levels of serotonin and monoamine oxidase. The combination of chronic bronchial obstruction with stable \"pulmogenic\" arterial hypertension was associated with a significantly decreased cardiac index, a reduction in the pulse blood filling of the brain as well as an increase in the peripheral vascular resistance, the pressure in the pulmonary artery, serotonin levels and monoamine oxidase activity. A multiple modality therapy (hydralazin, talinolol, hydrochlorothiazide) elicited an improvement of the hemodynamic and normalization of the biochemical parameters.", 
    "56": "Thyroid autoantibody synthesis was investigated in cultures of lymphocytes isolated from several sources, including thyroid and lymph nodes from patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease treated preoperatively with carbimazole or propranolol. The ability of thyroid lymphocytes to secrete immunoglobulins, including thyroid microsomal or thyroglobulin autoantibodies, was markedly reduced in lymphocyte suspensions obtained from patients treated with carbimazole compared with suspensions from patients treated with propranolol. This effect (which was greater in individuals treated with carbimazole for longer periods) was attributable to a significant reduction in the number of viable lymphocytes present after the 14-day culture interval. In contrast, the type of preoperative therapy had little effect on cultures of lymphocytes obtained from lymph nodes draining the thyroid. Although it is not yet clear whether carbimazole exerts its effects in vivo by direct immunosuppression or indirectly by altering the thyroid microenvironment, our observations indicate that the fall in serum levels of thyroid autoantibodies that occurs during carbimazole therapy is related to an effect of the drug on lymphocytes within the thyroid.", 
    "57": "A gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric method for the specific determination of oxprenolol and 2H6-labelled oxprenolol when both are present in the same sample is described. After addition of 13C3-labelled oxprenolol as internal standard, plasma is alkalized and extracted by a mixture of dichloromethane and diethyl ether. The residue following evaporation of the organic phase is derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride. Negative ion detection with N2O as reagent gas is used for the measurements at m/z 488, 491 and 494 for oxprenolol, the 13C3-labelled internal standard and 2H6-labelled oxprenolol, respectively. The precision and accuracy of the analytical method were investigated using samples containing both unlabelled and 2H6-labelled oxprenolol. The overall mean recovery (% +/- SD, n = 70) in the concentration range 20-1500 nmol l-1 (around 6-450 ng ml-1 of the hydrochloride salts) was 100.6 +/- 3.3 and 101.0 +/- 3.5 for oxprenolol and 2H6-labelled oxprenolol, respectively. The limit of quantification was around 20 nmol l-1 for both compounds.", 
    "58": "This study was designed to characterize adenosine's negative chronotropic effect on ventricular pacemakers. The spontaneous beating rate of isolated, isovolumic rat ventricular preparations perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution decreased as the adenosine concentration was increased [log M effective concentration 50% (EC50) = -5.22 +/- 0.17]. The lack of effect of propranolol or atropine on this adenosine response eliminates the involvement of endogenous neurotransmitters. Support for the involvement of an external cell surface receptor was provided by findings that theophylline and 8-(4-sulfophenyl)theophylline, an analogue thought to act solely at the cell surface, significantly increased the adenosine log M EC50 to -3.94 +/- 0.22 and -3.61 +/- 0.22, respectively. An increase in spontaneous beating rate induced by theophylline, but not by its analogue, was blocked by the addition of propranolol. The relative chronotropic potency of the adenosine analogues R-PIA, S-PIA, and NECA suggests that the cell surface receptors may be of the Ri type. The negative chronotropic effects of adenosine and its analogues occurred at concentrations that had no effect on the developed pressure of the paced preparation. Electrocardiographic evaluations indicate that at high agonist concentrations, there was an abrupt alteration in electrical properties of the preparation, which could be blocked by theophylline and its analogue.", 
    "59": "The ventricular isomyosin composition in the rat is characterized by three isoenzymes, V1, V2, and V3, with high, intermediate, and low Ca++-activated ATPase activity, speed of muscle shortening, and contractile economy. In this study, we examined the effects of propranolol on ventricular isomyosin composition in the rat. Eight 4-week-old male Wistar rats were treated from 4 to 12 weeks of age with daily 10 mg/kg subcutaneous doses of propranolol; four control rats were given subcutaneous distilled water. At the end of the treatment period, the efficacy of beta blockade was confirmed by isoproterenol test in some rats from each group. After the rats were killed left ventricular myosin from both control and propranolol-treated animals was purified and tested for Ca++-activated ATPase activity. Ventricular isomyosin composition was studied by gel electrophoresis in non-denaturing conditions. Heart rate was significantly lower in the propranolol group, while no differences in blood pressure, body weight, or ventricular weight were found between the two groups. Lower Ca++-activated ATPase activity values and a higher expression of myosin isoenzymes V2 and V3 were found in propranolol-treated rats. Possible links between the observed shift in ventricular isomyosin composition and the well-known modifications in myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption occurring after chronic propranolol administration remain to be established.", 
    "60": "We examined the secretory effects of two beta 2-adrenergic agonists, procaterole and terbutaline, on the submandibular glands of anesthetized rats. After stimulation with these agents with and without a range of antagonists (non-specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockers), submandibular saliva was collected. The flow rate, protein concentration, the electrophoretic patterns, and amino acid composition of saliva were examined. These parameters were compared with their counterparts in saliva stimulated with isoproterenol (IPR), with and without antagonists. Assessed by these criteria, secreted proteins were classified as the alpha- or beta-type. In addition, IPR-stimulated proteins were compared in submandibular saliva of rats chronically treated with IPR or procaterole. Both beta 2-agonists were potent secretagogues for the submandibular glands of rats. All beta-antagonists completely abolished the secretory effects elicited by both beta 2-agonists, with the exceptions of carteolol and propranolol. However, no blocking agent abolished the secretory effects of IPR (60 mg/kg). The types of proteins in all submandibular saliva samples elicited by both beta 2-agonists with and without antagonists were the beta-type. Enlargement of the submandibular glands was not observed in rats subjected to chronic administration of procaterole, nor were abnormal and additional proteins observed, as confirmed by electrophoresis and by the amino acid analyses.", 
    "61": "Beta adrenergic receptor binding sites were determined and characterized by specific binding of (+/-)[125I] iodocyanopindolol to membranes obtained from circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes. No difference was found in the number of receptor sites and in their dissociation constants (Kd) between patients with untreated essential hypertension (EH), EH treated with drugs other than beta blockers, and in normotensive controls. The group with EH receiving treatment with beta blockers had a significantly higher receptor density and Kd as compared with all the other groups (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the beta-adrenergic system of patients with essential hypertension at the receptor level is not different from normotensive subjects and responds to beta blockers by up-regulation.", 
    "62": "The inotropic selectivity of dobutamine was examined in pentobarbital-anesthetized, vagotomized dogs pretreated with a ganglion blocker. The purpose was to determine if, in the presence of hexamethonium and vagotomy, the inotropic selectivity of dobutamine could be attributed to an action of dobutamine on alpha-adrenoreceptors. Dose-response curves were determined for either isoproterenol or dobutamine 30 min after treatment with hexamethonium (20mg/kg). Analysis of heart rate versus right ventricular contractile force showed that dobutamine produced less tachycardia for a given increase in contractile force than isoproterenol; this was statistically significant when contractile force was increased by either 50 or 100%. In a separate series of experiments, dobutamine (8 micrograms . kg(1-) . min(-1)) was administered 20 min after propranolol (3 mg/kg). Under these conditions there was a slight increase in contractile force which represented 12% of the dobutamine response prior to propranolol administration. This increase in contractile force in the presence of propranolol was completely prevented by the addition of phentolamine (1 mg/kg). Consequently, in another series of experiments, dose-response curves for dobutamine were performed in the presence of hexamethonium before and 30 min after phentolamine alone (1 mg/kg) or vehicle. Phentolamine did not influence the effect of dobutamine on heart rate or contractile force, but prevented the increase in diastolic blood pressure caused by dobutamine. In addition, analysis of heart rate versus contractile force indicated that there were no statistically significant effects of phentolamine on the inotropic selectivity of dobutamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Phenylephrine (10 mg/ml), phentolamine (10 mg/ml), isoprenaline (0.5 mg/ml) and timolol (5 mg/ml) were applied topically to one eye of volunteers with normal corneas, the other eye serving as a control. One drop of each drug was given twice a day for 3 or 4 days. Timolol was found to increase corneal thickness in both the medicated and the control eye. A significantly greater effect was noted on the eye receiving the drug directly. When isoprenaline was given for 3 days, a slight significant decrease in corneal thickness was found in both the medicated and the control eye, with the two eyes exhibiting a similar CCT change. The present results are suggestive of endothelial beta-receptor importance in the regulation of corneal thickness.", 
    "64": "The significance of the carbohydrate moieties of the beta-adrenergic receptor molecule in the rat brain was examined using the radioligand binding assay method. Thus, this experiment was designed to assess the effects of lectins, concanavalin A (Con A), Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) on the affinity of the beta-adrenoceptor. The rat brain was used and the beta-adrenoceptor binding assay was carried out using 3H-dihydroalprenolol as a ligand. Con A and PHA significantly caused an increase in the values of the density of beta-adrenoceptor (Bmax) and a reduction in the values of the dissociation constant (Kd), but significant changes were not observed with WGA. These results strongly suggest that the carbohydrate moieties of the cell surface containing the beta-adrenoceptor molecule may have a crucial role in the drug-receptor interaction, and they imply that the beta-adrenoceptor molecule is a glycoprotein which contains N-linked carbohydrate chains.", 
    "65": "Inderal does not affect the thermoregulatory system in thermoneutral conditions. Blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors at 6 degrees C decreases the oxygen consumption in cold-acclimated rats and reduces it down to the level of control animals. Cold-acclimated rats have the same level of work hyperthermia at different ambient temperatures (26 degrees C, 6 degrees C) and under inderal injection. Control animals can only the same in warm environment.", 
    "66": "In acute experiments on cats, an isolated portion of the ileum was vascularly perfused with constant blood volume. Contractile activity of the ileum was estimated by isometric tension. The subthreshold dose of acetylcholine (6.10(-10)-6.10(-9) mol/ml/min) potentiated or inhibited the contractile responses of the ileum induced by i. a. administration of serotonin (2.5 X X 10(-8)-1.10(-7) mol). Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors with propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) diminished, and blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine (1 mg/kg) increased the serotonin-induced contractile responses. After beta-adrenergic blockade acetylcholine potentiated these responses in all experiments. After alpha-adrenergic blockade acetylcholine mostly inhibited serotonin-induced contractile responses. The facilitating effect of acetylcholine on the serotonin-induced contractile responses of the ileum seems to stem from the changed balance between inhibiting adrenergic and activating cholinergic mechanisms, the latter being predominant.", 
    "67": "A regulatory factor released from the effector cell during blockade of postsynaptic alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors with phentolamine and propranolol (5 X 10(7)-1 X 10(-6) M) and activating norepinephrine neuronal uptake and synthesis, was shown to activate, Na, K-ATPase of the rat isolated organs as well as the preparation of partly purified Na, K-ATPase extracted from the rat brain. Ouabain (1 X 10(-3) M) eliminated completely the activating effect of the regulatory factor on the ATPase.", 
    "68": "The distribution of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes in slide-mounted sections of guinea-pig kidney has been examined by the technique of in vitro labelling combined with autoradiography. Binding of (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol (Cyp) to kidney sections equilibrated and dissociated slowly, was saturable and stereoselective with respect to the isomers of propranolol and pindolol. These characteristics were appropriate for binding to beta-adrenoceptors. Delineation of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes was achieved by use of betaxolol (beta 1-adrenoceptors) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-adrenoceptors) and computer assisted curve fitting techniques. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in the proportions 1:2. 3H-Ultrofilm images of (-)-[125I]-Cyp binding to guinea-pig kidney sections showed localized patches of binding in the cortex and concentrated binding in the outer stripe of the medulla. Cortical receptors were of the beta 1 subtype and those associated with the outer stripe of the medulla were of the beta 2-adrenoceptor subtype. beta 1-Adrenoceptors were concentrated over glomeruli and beta 2-adrenoceptors over the straight portion of the proximal tubule.", 
    "69": "Administration of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) into the left lateral cerebral ventricle (i.c.v.) of urethane anaesthetized rats caused increases in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Pretreatment of the animals with the alpha-receptor blocking drug prazosin completely prevented the PGD2-induced rise in blood pressure, but did not affect the chronotropic and hyperpyrexic effects of PGD2. Pretreatment of the rats with the beta-receptor blocking drug propranolol completely suppressed the increase in heart rate, augmented the rise in blood pressure, but reduced the temperature increase by more than 50%. These data indicate that central activation of the sympathetic nervous system mediates the cardiovascular and important parts of the temperature effects of i.c.v.-injected PGD2. The peripheral vasoconstriction (due to the stimulation of sympathetic alpha-receptors) causing the blood pressure increase is obviously of minor importance for the rise in body temperature. In contrast the enhanced production of heat by several organs following beta-receptor activation seems to be an important factor for the temperature increase.", 
    "70": "Possible reasons for the previously detected inhibitory effect of gamma-radiation (100-1000 Gy in vitro) on isoproterenol-stimulated activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) of the liver plasma membranes of a 20-day-old rat fetus were investigated. It was discovered that the number of beta-adrenergic receptors was reduced. Analysis of basal and fluorine-stimulated activities of AC attests to the radiation-induced damage to catalytic and N-regulatory proteins. The radiation-induced derangement of membrane lipids, where AC functions, is shown.", 
    "71": "Lung distension is associated with increased phospholipid secretion into the air spaces. Basal, lavage-induced, and inflation-produced phospholipid secretion, in postmortem in situ lungs of newborn rabbits, were examined at three different levels of maturity, with and without 10(-3) M dl-propranolol. Lungs were lavaged with saline at successive 3- and 15-min time intervals to separate basal from lavage-induced secretion. Inflation-produced secretion was studied after static inflation at 30 cmH2O for 30 min. At 27.5 days gestation, basal secretion was undetectable, and neither lavage-induced nor inflation-produced secretion were influenced by propranolol. At 29.5 days gestation, basal secretion was only just detectable. Distension-associated secretion was increased over that present at 27.5 days gestation, and propranolol had a significant inhibitory effect, especially on lavage-induced secretion, in which the inhibition was shown to be rapidly reversible. There was a significant increase of basal secretion at 2.5 days postterm, possibly inhibited by propranolol. In addition, there was a further substantial increase of distension-associated secretion, and the inhibitory effect of propranolol persisted. These changes were independent of the sedimentation behavior of lavaged phospholipid. Overall, the results are consistent with evidence, produced in other laboratories, that there is an increasing density of sympathetic neurons and beta-adrenergic receptors in whole lung preparations during late gestation in the rabbit and suggest that granular pneumocytes, the presumed source of secreted phospholipid, take part in this developmental change.", 
    "72": "Catecholamines may be one of the molecular signals linking increased circulatory demand to myocardial hypertrophy, and I have found previously that norepinephrine stimulates hypertrophy of cultured neonatal rat heart muscle cells through an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. Since catecholamine stimulation of contractility is believed to be under beta-adrenergic control, I asked whether these cultured heart cells had dual pathways regulating growth and contractility through alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, respectively. I examined the effect of adrenergic agents on hypertrophy and beating of myocytes in serum-free cultures. Hypertrophy was defined as an increase in myocyte surface area and in cell protein content, measured by a radioisotopic method, and chronotropic activity was examined visually. Norepinephrine and epinephrine were equipotent stimulants of hypertrophy and beating, increasing cell protein and area 1.5- to 2-fold, and the proportion of beating cells from 5% or less to 95%. Response maxima occurred 24-48 hours after exposure, and EC50 were 20-200 nM. Studies with other agonists (phenylephrine, methoxamine, clonidine, isoproterenol, dopamine) and antagonists (prazosin, terazosin, yohimbine, propranolol, betaxolol, ICI 118,551) indicated that hypertrophy was mediated through an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor, whereas the induction of beating required both alpha 1- and beta 1-receptor activation. Hypertrophied cells with minimal beating were produced by alpha-stimulation, alone. In contrast, alpha-plus beta-stimulation in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis resulted in maximum beating but no hypertrophy. These findings imply that growth and beating can be regulated independently through separate cellular pathways.", 
    "73": "Cephalic or cranial pressure, i.e., pressure recorded craniad from the external carotid artery, was recorded in the cat during stimulation of the pre- and postganglionic trunks of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) as was tension developed by the nictitating membrane under these situations. The influence of distension of the carotid sinus and of metoprolol on hemodynamic and tension responses was compared with control responses. Distension of the sinus with an indwelling balloon produced an increase of cephalic pressure evoked by stimulation of the SCG. Tension developed by the nictitating membrane was unaffected. Metoprolol reduced the increase in pressure resulting from stimulation of the preganglionic trunk of the SCG at 1.0 Hz but enhanced the pressure increase in the cranial circulation evoked by postganglionic stimulation of the SCG at 5.0 Hz. Action potentials, recorded postganglionically from the SCG, could be roughly grouped by height and latency into three populations. The height of the M3 population increased with distension of the carotid sinus. This study provides evidence that cephalic pressure can be used as a measure of the influence of various factors on the transmission of impulses through the SCG. This parameter appears to be a more sensitive measure of transmission than that of tension developed by the nictitating membrane. Distension of the carotid sinus is one factor that facilitates ganglionic transmission, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol depresses it.", 
    "74": "A procedure for effective application of ultrafiltration is described for preparation of serum catecholamine samples suitable for a sensitive radioreceptor assay. Each of the fresh serum samples unsuitable for the direct receptor assay was dialyzed by applying centrifugal force into a capsule-shaped porous core whose surface was tightly covered with a molecular filtration membrane. Interfering macromolecular serum components were left outside the capsule during the centrifugation or forced dialysis. The ultrafiltrate in the capsule was readily recovered by another centrifugation, and was found satisfactory as an assay specimen. In the radioreceptor assay system adapted to detect 30 pg per assay tube, epinephrine added to fresh serum to make the final concentration approximately 1 X 10(-8) mol/L was recovered semiquantitatively. Serum catecholamine level determined was equivalent to beta-adrenergic receptor reactivity that could be expressed in terms of (-)-epinephrine concentration.", 
    "75": "The mechanism whereby thyroid hormones modulate the transport properties of luminal brush border membrane (BBM) of renal proximal tubules was studied in thyroparathyroidectomized rats. Administration of both T4 and T3 increased BBM capacity for Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of phosphate (Pi) by BBM vesicles (BBMV). This effect of thyroid hormones was present in thyroparathyroidectomized and hypophysectomized rats, and it was not blocked by a saturating dose of propranolol. The stimulatory effect of T3 and T4 on BBM transport of Pi was dose dependent in the range of 5.2-520 nmol/100 g BW. Pretreatment of rats with inhibitors of 5'-monodeiodinase (5'-DI), iopanoic acid or ipodate, prevented the increase in serum T3 in rats injected with T4, but it did not diminish the increase in BBM transport of Pi. Administration of iopanoic acid and ipodate also prevented a 5-fold increase in 5'-DI activity in renal cortical tissue elicited by T4 administration. Treatment with T3 resulted in an increase of Pi transport across BBM from kidneys of rats subjected to dietary Pi deprivation due either to total fasting or to feeding of a low Pi diet. Further, T3 administration enhanced amiloride-sensitive Na+-H+ countertransport across BBM, but the uptake of 22Na+ by BBMV in the absence of pH gradient was not changed. The Na+ gradient-dependent uptake of L-[3H]proline by BBMV was slightly decreased, but the uptake of [14C]citrate was not changed in response to T3. Administration of T3 increased Pi transport in BBMV prepared from juxtamedullary cortex, but not in BBMV from superficial cortex. Conversely, the rate of Na+-H+ countertransport was enhanced, and the enzymatic activity of alkaline phosphatase was decreased in BBMV from superficial cortex; no changes in these parameters were found in BBMV from juxtamedullary cortex. Our results indicate that the stimulatory effect of administered T3 and/or T4 on renal BBM transport of Pi is distinct from the modulatory effect of dietary Pi intake and is not secondary to the beta-effect of catecholamines or to altered secretion of GH. Both T3 and T4 elicit the increase in BBM transport of Pi in a similar manner; T4 is effective even after profound inhibition of in vivo conversion of T4 to T3 by potent 5'-DI inhibitors. Administration of T3 stimulates Na+ gradient-dependent Pi uptake only in BBMV prepared from the juxtamedullary zone, and it stimulates the H+-Na+ countertransport only in BBMV from the outer cortical zone. These findings indicate that thyroid hormones modulate the two distinct transport functions of BBM derived from two different populations of renal proximal tubules.", 
    "76": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether the alpha-adrenergic stimulation of TSH secretion may occur directly at the median eminence (ME) level by modulating the release of TRH. The effects of pharmacological manipulations of the two subtypes of central alpha-adrenergic receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, were tested on in vitro TRH release from medial basal hypothalami containing mainly the ME. Hypothalamic fragments were superfused with a modified Locke medium, and TRH was measured by RIA in samples collected every 10 min. After a preliminary period of 40 min to test TRH release during basal conditions, drug effects were checked for 20 min. Superfusion with norepinephrine (NE) (10(-10), 10(-8), 10(-6) M) induced a rapid and dose-dependent rise of TRH release; epinephrine (10(-8) M) induced an effect similar to that of NE 10(-8) M. Phentolamine (10(-7) M), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, completely blocked the NE (10(-8) M)-induced release of TRH, which was not modified by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (10(-7) M). Neither antagonist had an effect on basal TRH release when added alone to the medium. The NE-induced release of TRH was completely suppressed by prazosin (10(-7) M), whereas yohimbine had no effect. Superfusion with clonidine (10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M), an alpha 2-receptor agonist, did not alter basal TRH release. In contrast, phenylephrine (10(-8) and 10(-6) M), an alpha 1-receptor agonist, induced a significant (P less than 0.01) rise in TRH release. These results were corroborated in vivo in several unanesthetized rats bearing a push-pull cannula previously and stereotaxically implanted into the ME. Perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing NE (10(-7), 10(-6) M) or phenylephrine (10(-7) M) elicited a rapid rise in TRH release, within 15 min after the onset of drug perfusion. Clonidine (10(-5) M), similarly perfused for 15 min, had no effect. Our data suggest a direct stimulatory influence of catecholamines on TRH release at the ME level that is mediated through alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "77": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol has been found to inhibit platelet aggregation. We investigated the possibility that propranolol exerts this action by stimulating the synthesis or enhancing the antiaggregatory activity of prostaglandin (PG) I2. The media from cultures of human endothelial cells inhibited thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, an effect attributed to PGI2 production by the cells. When endothelial cells were incubated with dl- or d-propranolol, the media had two to three times the inhibitory activity of control media. However, this increased activity was not due to increased synthesis of PGI2 because control and propranolol-treated cultures synthesized similar amounts of the PGI2 metabolite, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. Instead, propranolol enhanced the antiaggregatory activity of PGI2. Propranolol (1 microM) and PGI2 (0.05 nM), when tested separately, inhibited aggregation by 19% and 13%, respectively, whereas the combination inhibited aggregation by 51%. PGI2 inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane (Tx) B2 production but stimulated cyclic AMP formation. The adenyl cyclase inhibitor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA) had no effect of its own on these parameters, but blocked the actions of PGI2. Propranolol inhibited aggregation and TxB2 synthesis without changing cyclic AMP levels. Unlike PGI2, propranolol's effects were not altered by DDA. While the combination of propranolol and PGI2 inhibited aggregation to a greater extent than either agent alone, this enhanced effect with the combination did not extend to TxB2 or cyclic AMP production. Propranolol, PGI2, and the combination inhibited TxB2 synthesis to a similar extent, and PGI2 produced a similar increase in cyclic AMP in the presence and absence of propranolol. These findings indicate that propranolol and PGI2 inhibit platelet aggregation through cyclic AMP-independent and dependent mechanisms, respectively. While propranolol does not alter the synthesis of PGI2, it enhances the inhibition of aggregation by PGI2, and this may contribute to its antiplatelet effect.", 
    "78": "Platelets are believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and of the vascular obstruction that causes the acute complications of coronary artery disease. Since specific behavioral patterns appear to be related to the development of coronary artery disease and since emotional stress may predispose an individual to acute cardiovascular ischemia, it was hypothesized that platelet activation by catecholamines might be involved in these events. To study emotional stress, plasma samples were obtained from 61 senior medical residents immediately before they were to speak in public. There were significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the platelet-secreted proteins platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin and epinephrine and norepinephrine immediately before speaking, which demonstrates that platelet activation and secretion occur in association with this type of emotional stress. Four trials were carried out to study the mechanism for this observed platelet secretion: (1) phenoxybenzamine, (2) propranolol, (3) 650 mg aspirin, and (4) 80 mg aspirin were given several hours before the public speaking engagement. Neither phenoxybenzamine nor propranolol in doses that blocked the hemodynamic effects of alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenergic stimulation modified platelet secretion. Aspirin also did not block platelet secretion, which suggests that platelets were not being stimulated through a cyclooxygenase-dependent pathway. This study provides direct evidence of platelet secretion in vivo in association with emotional stress, and underscores the potential importance of platelet activation and secretion in the acute events that occur in patients with vascular disease.", 
    "79": "After ingestion of 12 g of theophylline caused severe toxicity in a young woman, we developed an experimental canine model to study human theophylline toxicity. Our study involved four anesthetized dogs given theophylline in a continuous intravenous drip for 180 minutes in one of four protocols. The protocols included a low-dose infusion (400 mg/h), a high-dose infusion (1000 mg/h), a high-dose infusion with beta-blockade induced by propranolol at 125 minutes after infusion, and a high-dose infusion while maintaining beta-blockade with propranolol throughout the experiment. Toxic levels of theophylline were associated with hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypotension in both the patient and the experimental series. These effects were either prevented or partially reversed after induction of beta-blockade with propranolol. Very high levels of theophylline were associated with elevated levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the animals."
