    "0": "Regulation of respiration by catecholamines was studied in adipocytes isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue of warm-acclimated rats by rapid digestion of collagenase. (-)-Norepinephrine stimulated adipocyte respiration 10-12 times above basal values in less than 3 min. (Vmax = 410 +/- 29.5 nmol O2 . min-1 . 10(-6) cells-1). Stimulated respiration remained stable for at least 20 min, provided that cells were incubated in balanced salt media containing bicarbonate. The maximal capacity of total brown adipose tissue for norepinephrine-stimulated respitarion was estimated at 1.5 ml O2/min per rat. beta-Adrenergic agonists increased calorigenesis stereospecifically with an order of potency expected for respiratory stimulation via adrenoceptors of the beta 1-subtype: (-)-isoproterenol (1/2 Vmax = 2 nM) greater than (-)-norepinephrine (1/2 Vmax = 20 nM) approximately equal to (-)-epinephrine (1/2 Vmax = 40 nM) greater than corresponding (+)-stereoisomers. The alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (1/2 Vmax = 5 microM) stimulated adipocyte respiration as rapidly and as effectively as beta-agonists. Although alpha-adrenoreceptors are present in brown adipose tissue, studies with alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists revealed that norepinephrine elicits thermogenesis at physiological concentrations (less than or equal to 1 microM) predominantely via beta 1-adrenergic pathways.", 
    "1": "The relative bronchomotor activities of prostaglandins (PG) E1, E2, F2 alpha, F2 beta and I2 and of three synthetic E prostaglandin analogues (TR4161, TR4367 and TR4752) were determined on a large number of isolated preparations of guinea-pig trachea and human bronchial muscle. Each prostaglandin was capable of eliciting both contraction and relaxation, the relative incidence of these responses partly depending on concentration. TR4161 was a virtually pure relaxant; TR4367 was virtually devoid of bronchomotor activity; and TR4752 was a potent relaxant, devoid of contractant activity. The results also provided distinct rank orders of approximate potency for contraction and relaxation. Tachyphylaxis to the relaxant activities of PGE1 and TR4752 confirmed the underlying contractant activity of the two natural E prostaglandins. Antagonism with a high dose of indomethacin of the contractant actions of PGE1, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha confirmed the presence of relaxant activities in each. Inhaled aerosols of the same natural and synthetic prostaglandins were evaluated for irritant activity on the airways, using the cough response of the restrained conscious cat. All of them, except TR4161, elicited severe coughing. The rank order of potencies for irritancy differed from those for tracheobronchial contractant and relaxant activities. These findings suggest that the three responses studied arise from the activation of three distinct PG receptors in the airways. We propose the terms chi (contractant), psi (relaxant) and omega (irritant) for these putative receptors for prostaglandins or possibly other prostanoids.", 
    "2": "The pA2 values of the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol and alpha-methylpropranolol, have been assessed using the selective agonists, norepinephrine and fenoterol, as positive chronotropic agents in atria. In cat atria both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors influence atrial rate, whereas in guinea pig atria only beta 1-receptors are involved.", 
    "3": "We immunized rabbits with an antigen prepared by covalent linkage of alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, to bovine serum albumin. Competitive inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to antisera with a variety of unlabeled ligands revealed broad antibody specificity for beta-adrenergic antagonists and agonists. The antiserum was subjected to affintiy fractionation on hydroxybenzylpindolol-Sepharose 4B. Successive elution with 100 mM Tris HCl, 1M NaCl, 4 M LiBr, and 5 M guanidine yielded fractions with increasing affintiy for hydroxybenzylpindolol. The ligand-binding properties of these affinity-fractionated antibodies suggest that certain of these fractions recognize structural aspects of individual beta-adrenergic ligands which are irrelevant to their biological activity, whereas others can be used to distinguish shared functional properties, such as the ethanolamine side chain, within the structural heterogeneity of beta-adrenergic drugs. In particular, elution of hydroxybenzylpindolol-adsorbed antibody with (-)-propranolol allowed identification of an antibody fraction specific for the (-)-stereoisomer. Thus, affinity fractionation of antibodies raised against beta-adrenergic ligands can provide useful analogues for the further study of the recognition properties of the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "4": "Treatment of the neurointermediate lobe of the rat pituitary gland with mechanical agitation in the presence of trypsin and DNAse results in a preparation of cells which secrete alpha MSH and synthesize cAMP. The receptors for catecholamines present in the intact intermediate lobe remain functional on the dispersed cells. Thus, stimulation of a beta-adrenoceptor with (l)isoproterenol enhances the secretion of alpha MSH. This receptor is stereospecific and responds to low concentrations of isoproterenol (EC50 = 0.4 nM). Activation of a beta-adrenoceptor also increases the accumulation of cAMP. Furthermore, dopamine inhibits the basal release of alpha MSH but has no effect on basal levels of cAMP. In addition, dopamine inhibits the isoproterenol-enhanced release of alpha MSH as well as the isoproterenol-induced accumulation of cAMP.", 
    "5": "The initial effects of diazoxide on dynamic pulmonary compliance (CL) and flow resistance (RL) were measured in paralyzed, anesthetized guinea-pigs. Diazoxide (10, 20 or 40 mg/kg) caused a dose-related increase in RL and decrease in CL. The increase in RL could be selectively abolished by glossopharyngealotomy or decentralization, and by pretreatment with mepyramine (0.1 mg/kg) or disodium cromoglycate (10 mg/kg). Pretreatment with indomethacin (0.1 mg/kg) or acetylsalicylic acid (1 mg/kg) selectively eliminated the decreases in compliance observed after diazoxide. It is concluded that diazoxide initially constricts both large (RL) and small (CL) airways. The constriction of the large airways may involve a release of histamine, whereas the constriction of the small airways may be mediated by a prostaglandin or prostaglandin-like substance.", 
    "6": "The social interaction test in rats provides a method for detecting anxiolytic activity that does not use food or water deprivation, or electric shock, and therefore obviates difficulties of interpretation that might arise from drug-induced changes in motivation. Since social interaction is measured under more than one test condition any overall increase or decrease in social behaviour can be detected independently from the drug x test condition interaction that characterizes an anxiolytic drug. The Geller-Seifter conflict test was designed with two schedules of reinforcement for the same reasons. Any candidate test for anxiolytic action that examines drug effects under only one experimental condition is open to misinterpretation and may also prove unreliable if the critical experimental factors ( e.g. the level of food deprivation or the shock intensity) are changed. The testing procedure in the social interaction test is relatively time consuming in terms of observer-hours, but no lengthy pretraining of the animals is required. There is no way of fully automating the scoring and therefore it is important that the observers do not know the experimental group of the rats that they are scoring, and that tape recordings are made so that the scores can be checked. It has not so far been fruitful to analyze drug effects on every individual social behaviour, but this method does allow changes in individual behaviours to be detected. By entering the data directly into a computer we are now able to store the frequency and duration of each behaviour as well as the sequence of behaviours. It will then be possible to determine whether a detailed analysis of drug effects on the patterning of social behaviours will prove a useful addition to the social interaction test", 
    "7": "A variety of neuropharmacological agents were tested to elucidate how chlorpromazine influenced an endotoxin-induced reaction. The results obtained, particularly with beta-adrenergic blocking agents, reserpine and fusaric acid, suggested that the primary locus of chlorpromazine's action was mediated by peripheral beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Such a locus is compatible with the low doses of propranolol which suppress the reaction, and with successful treatment of shock with dopamine.", 
    "8": "The interactions of catecholamine and thyroid hormones in determining changes in metabolic rate were assessed in obese patients given propranolol, both on weight maintenance diet and during semistarvation. Propranolol reduced the resting metabolic rate by 8.6% on a weight maintenance diet but had no effect during energy restriction. Since propranolol led to a similar fall in triiodothyronine (T3) and an increase in reverse T3 on both diets, the early fall in RMR on semi-starvation may depend on catecholamine-mediated mechanisms. Beta-adrenergic blockade might promote energy retention on a normal energy intake but should not reduce the efficacy of slimming diets.", 
    "9": "Plasma concentrations of dl- and l-propranolol were determined in rabbits after the i.v. injection of 200, 400 and 800 micrograms/kg of dl-propranolol. The data conformed to a biexponential equation. The beta adrenoceptor blocking activity was measured by the percent reduction in isoproterenolol-induced tachycardia after the administration of dl-propranolol. The l-isomer had a longer plasma half-life than dl-propranolol at each dose during the beta-phase. At a dose of 800 micrograms/kg, both dl- and l-propranolol had longer plasma half-life than those of 200 and 400 micrograms/kg doses and a smaller total plasma clearance was observed to 800 micrograms/kg, although statistically not significant. At steady state, plasma concentrations of both dl- and l-propranolol correlated well with beta adrenoceptor blocking activity (r = 0.913 for dl-propranolol and r = 0.939 for the l-isomer). These results demonstrate that after the administration of the racemic drug l-propranolol had a longer plasma half-life. The plasma concentration of dl- and l-propranolol is a good parameter for beta adrenoceptor blocking activity. The pharmacologic activity of propranolol at the highest dose persists longer than expected, probably due to hemodynamic alterations, which causes a decrease in liver blood flow with the resultant reduction in the elimination rate of the drug.", 
    "10": "The medicamentous therapy of the angina pectoris vera and of the chronic ischaemic heart disease is at present based on three groups of medicaments: nitrate compounds, beta-blocking agents and calcium antagonists. The underlying therapeutic principle which is common for them consists in the reduction of the oxygen requirement of the myocardium so that an improvement of the complaints and a larger load capacity may be achieved. The improvement may be objectified also at the behaviour of the haemodynamics and the ECG under load. The so-called coronary dilating remedies and the beta-stimulators did not prove clinically. In the acute attack rapidly acting nitroglycerin compounds remain the remedies of choice. Also the permanent treatment should at first again use longer acting nitrate preparations. When despite a sufficient dosage no satisfying improvement takes place an additional prescription of beta-blocking agents is recommended. Calcium antagonists are suitable particularly for the vasospastic form of the angina pectoris. They can be used also as basis medicaments, however, according to the hitherto yielded experiences they do not possess any advantages in contrast to the proved nitrates and beta-blocking agents. When apart from the ischaemic heart disease a hypertension exists, the beta-blocking agents are particularly indicated. This is further important for certain forms of tachycardiac disturbances of rhythm, which partly also well response to calcium antagonists. In patients with disturbances of conduction (sinus node and atrioventricular nodes, bifascicular block) beta-blocking agents are contraindicated. If there are no signs of cardiac decompensation and radiologically the heart proves to be normally large, so there is no indication for the prescription of glycosides.", 
    "11": "On carbachol-contracted tracheal preparations from guinea-pigs, the slope of the Schild plot for propranolol (isoprenaline as agonist) was 1.0. The slope of the plots for atenolol (beta 1-selective) and butoxamine (beta 2-selective) were less than 1.0, whether isoprenaline or fenoterol was agonist. This was in contrast to previous reports on intrinsic tone tracheal preparations. It was established that the low slopes for atenolol and butoxamine on carbachol-contracted preparations were not related to aspects of the experimental procedures. Low slopes on carbachol-contracted preparations tended to occur when the antagonist used was selective and, although the reason for this is not clear, it may be related to the presence of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in this tissue. Therefore, it is suggested that pA2 values obtained for selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on guinea-pig tracheal preparations contracted with carbachol may not be strictly valid, and that antagonists should be studied on intrinsic tone tracheal preparations when pA2 values are to be compared with pA2 values from other tissues to quantify the selectivity of the antagonist.", 
    "12": "Sixteen patients (11 M, 5 F), median age 41 years, with essential hypertension insufficiently controlled on hydrochlorothiazide 75 mg/day (DBP greater than or equal to 100 mmHg) were investigated. Plasma renin concentration (PRC), angiotensin II concentration (PA II), aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma noradrenaline concentration (PNAC), plasma volume (PV) and exchangeable sodium (NaE) were determined and a saralasin-infusion (5.4 nmol/kg/min) was carried out while the patients were on thiazide alone, and in fourteen cases, repeated 3 months later after addition of a beta-blocker (propranolol 6, metoprolol 6 and atenolol 2 patients). On thiazide alone PRC, PA II and PAC was higher than normal in the group as a whole and the angiotensin II-inhibitor, saralasin, caused a significant decrease in MAP in twelve out of sixteen patients. After addition of a beta-blocker SBP and DBP decreased from 164/109 mmHg to 136/94 mmHg. PRC and PA II decreased by 40% and 58%, respectively. At this point saralasin caused no significant change in MAP. No close correlation was found between changes in BP on beta-blocker treatment and either PRC, PA II or saralasin response on thiazide treatment. PV, NaE, PAC and PNAC did not change sigificantly. It is concluded that in pts with thiazide-induced stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) addition of a beta-blocker leads to suppression of RAS and the angiotensin II dependence of the blood pressure is nearly abolished. This mechanism might well contribute to the antihypertensive effect of beta-blockade in this particular situation. However, the pharmacological changes induced by beta-blockade are very complex, and most likely other factors are involved in the antihypertensive effect of beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "13": "Two beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, metoprolol (beta-1-selective) and propranolol (non-selective), were used in the treatment of hyperthyroid patients. The response of pituitary stress hormones to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia was investigated before and during beta-adrenoceptor blockage. Treatment with metoprolol (n=10) or propranolol (n=10) produced no changes in the cortisol or prolactin responses to hypoglycaemia. Moreover the growth hormone response remained unaltered during treatment with metoprolol. A small, but statistically significant, augmentation of growth hormone response was obtained during treatment with propranolol. When twelve subjects, euthyroid after final conventional treatment (surger), radioiodine or thyrostatic drugs), were re-examined, the cortisol and prolactin responses were unchanged, although growth hormone concentrations reached a slightly higher maximum value (P less than 0.01). It was concluded that treatment with beta-blocking agents in hyperthyroid subjects has no clinically important influence on the release of pituitary stress hormones during hypoglycaemia.", 
    "14": "New beta-adrenergic blocking agents, most of which do not contain an aromatic nucleus, were synthesized. They were derived either from alkylamino-aliphatic oxime ethers or alkylamino-aliphatic ethers. Most active among these are O-[3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropyl]acetoxime (8; trachea pA2 = 7.65) and 1-isobutoxy-3-(tert-butylamino)-2-propanol (15; trachea pA2 = 7.49), both of which displayed bronchoselectivity (beta 2/beta 1 ratio approximately 15). The role and importance of the aromatic nucleus in this class of compounds are discussed.", 
    "15": "1 The effects of betaxolol (SL 75212), a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, on the cardiovascular response to exercise have been studied in six normal subjects after placebo and single oral doses of 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg given double-blind in a randomized sequence. 2 All doses reduced exercise heart rate, with a significant reduction persisting to 23 h after doses of 20 mg and 40 mg. Systolic blood pressure on exercise was reduced after all doses, with a reduction continuing to 23 h after doses of 10 mg and above. 3 The mean elimination half-life of SL 75212 was 17.5 +/- 3.9 h. The plasma clearance ranged from 0.15--0.48 1 kg-1 h-1 and the volume of distribution from 5.8--13 1 kg-1. 4 There was a significant correlation between the peak blood levels and change in exercise heart rate (r = 0.53, P less than 0.05) and between the area under the blood concentration curve and the effect of the exercise heart rate (r = 0.55, P less than 0.01).", 
    "16": "Antihypertensive drugs that alter the function of the adrenergic neuron make up one of the largest groups of medications used to treat elevated blood pressure. The mechanisms of action and clinical pharmacology of widely used antihypertensive drugs that interfere with adrenergic function are reviewed. Emphasis is placed on the importance of an understanding of the biochemistry of the adrenergic neuron and the subclassification of adrenoceptors for an appreciation of the mechanism of action and the side effects of these drugs.", 
    "17": "The relationship among cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume, cardiac output (CO), and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) at varying levels of arterial CO2 tensions (PaCO2) were studied in 70 normal cats. The CBF was measured from the clearance curve of xenon-133 and CO with a thermal dilution catheter placed in the pulmonary artery. The CBF, CO, and MABP values varied appropriately with changes in PaCO2, confirming the reliability of the preparations and the presence of normal autoregulatory responses. Moderate hypovolemia that did not change MABP did, nevertheless, significantly decrease CO and CBF. In an effort to determine if this decrease in CO and CBF were coupled responses, the effects of beta stimulation, hypervolemia, and alpha and beta blockade were investigated. Propranolol, in a dosage insufficient to change MABP, decreased both CO and CBF. This agent abolished the CO response to elevations in PaCO2 but not the CBF response, making it unlikely that this CBF reduction resulted from impaired cerebral autoregulation. Isoproterenol, which, in contrast to propranolol, does not cross the normal blood-brain barrier, alone or in combination with phenoxybenzamine, produced a 38% and 72% increase in CO, respectively, without a change in CBF. Alpha blockade (no major change in CO) and beta blockage (major decrease in CO) did not significantly effect cerebral autoregulation to changes in MABP from angiotensin. The ability of the brain to resist increases in MABP and CO and maintain normal CBF is explained by normal cerebral autoregulation. However, its vulnerability to modest decreases in blood volume, which cannot be attributed to variations in perfusion pressure, is unexplained but obviously has important therapeutic implications. This may be related to reduction in CO, changes in autonomic activity, or a decrease in the size of the perfused capillary bed.", 
    "18": "A series of new phenylethanolamines with 2-methoxy and/or 4-methyl, 4-chloro, or 4-bromo ring substituents and either N-isopropyl or N-tert butyl substituents have been synthesized and tested for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking activity using isolated guinea pig atrial and tracheal preparations. Each of the disubstituted N-isopropyl derivatives was a potent antagonist, and the 2-methoxy-4-methyl derivative had a 40-fold beta 1/beta 2-receptor selectivity. Atenolol was shown to have a 32-fold selectivity in the same tests.", 
    "19": "A range of norepinephrine analogues has been studied in rat tracheal, atrial, and aortic preparations. Isopropyl appeared to be the most favorable N-substituent for agonist action on tracheal adrenoceptors, whereas hydroxyphenylisopropyl gave highest activity on atrial adrenoceptors. Selectivity for the beta 2-adrenoceptor was improved with tertiary branching at the gamma-carbon and further increased by aromatic substitution with resorcinol or saligenin. Alpha-Adrenoceptor properties were substantially modified by N-substitution, whereas aromatic substitution was an important factor in determining beta-adrenoceptor agonist or antagonist activity at the beta-adrenoceptor. The data were consistent with norepinephrine analogues having multiple sites of attachment to the receptor membrane influencing receptor potency and selectivity. The data also suggest that compounds of this type can have actions on both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "A crude particulate fraction of human placenta possesses a high concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors, as determined by (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding (approximately 240 fmol/mg protein; Kd approximately 2 nM). The sites display all the typical characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors, including rapid and reversible kinetics, saturability, and appropriate specificity and stereospecificity. Computer modelling of ligand binding data indicate that the binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to these sites conforms closely to the pattern anticipated for interactions of the ligand with a homogeneous class of receptors according to the law of mass action. The rejeptors are readily solubilized with digitonin, retaining their typical beta-adrenergic characteristics. The human placenta is likely to be a particularly useful source of beta-adrenergic receptors for purification because of its high receptor content and its ready availability in substantial quantities.", 
    "21": "Tachycardia in delirium tremens is often not adequately controlled by present delirium therapy but it can be treated with beta-receptor blockers. The favorable effect on the disorder expressed as adrenergic tachycardia due to raised excretion of catecholamine during delirium tremens is shown by pindolol (Visken) in a series of 14 patients. A favorable effect on the hypertensive circulatory condition in delirium tremens was also shown by certain ECG changes beyond those of tachycardia. In one case, a severe anaphylactic reaction occurred after the i. v. application of pindolol. No other side-effects were observed.", 
    "22": "Studies have been carried out in the turkey erythrocyte to examine: (1) the influence of external K+ concentration on both [3H]ouabain binding and the sensitivity of potassium influx to inhibition by ouabain and (2) the quantitative relation between beta-adrenergic receptor site occupancy, agonist-directed cyclic AMP generation and potassium influx rate. Both [3H]ouabain binding and the ability of ouabain to inhibit potassium influx are markedly reduced at increasing external K+ concentrations, and at each K+ concentration the concentrations of ouabain required for half-maximal binding to the erythrocyte membrane and for half-maximal inhibition of potassium influx are identical. Both basal and isoproterenol-stimulated potassium influx rise with increasing external K+ concentrations. In contrast to basal potassium influx, which is 50-70% inhibitable by ouabain, the isoproterenol-stimulated component of potassium influx is entirely insensitive to ouabain. At all concentrations of K+, inhibition of basal potassium influx by ouabain is linear with ouabain binding, indicating that the rate of transport per unoccupied ouabain binding site is unaffected by simultaneous occupancy of other sites by ouabain. Similarly, the rate of isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis is directly proportional to beta-adrenergic receptor occupany over the entire concentration-response relationship for isoproterenol, showing that at all levels of occupancy beta-adrenergic receptor sites function independently of each other. Analysis of the relation of catecholamine-dependent potassium transport to the number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites occupied indicates an extremely sensitive physiological system, in which 50%-maximal stimulation of potassium transport is achieved at less than 3% receptor occupancy, corresponding to fewer than ten occupied receptors per cell.", 
    "23": "Selective neuronal lesions have been utilized in efforts to localize binding sites in rat brain for beta-adrenergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), histamine H1 and benzodiazepine receptors. The various receptors respond differentially to lesions both in extent of change and in time course. After kainate lesions in the corpus striatum, benzodiazepine receptors are depleted up to 45% at 45--78 days but are unaffected after 7 days. By contrast striatal GABA receptors are increased at 7 days but depleted at later times. Thus both striatal benzodiazepine and GABA receptors appear to be associated at least in part with intrinsic neurons. In the cerebellum both benzodiazepine and GABA receptors are reduced in kainate treated rats and in Nervous mice, mutants which lack Purkinje cells. The most pronounced dissimilarity between benzodiazepine and GABA receptors occurs in Weaver mice, which selectively lack granule cells and display a 60% reduction in GABA receptors but a 40% augmentation in benzodiazepine receptors. A major portion of cerebellar GABA receptors, therefore, appear to be localized to granule cells. Striatal beta-adrenergic receptors are reduced following intrastriatal kainate injections but are unaffected by cerebral cortex ablation, suggesting an association with intrinsic neurons but not with axon terminals of the corticostriate pathway. While intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine enhance [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, such binding is not augmented in the corpus striatum, brain stem, midbrain or thalamus-hypothalamus by this treatment. Moreover, medial forebrain bundle lesions, which destroy ascending adrenergic neurons, fail to alter cerebral cortical or striatal beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus denervation-elicited increases in beta-adrenergic receptors vary with brain region and the type of denervating lesion. Histamine H1-receptors are the most resistant of all to neuronal lesions. In the corpus striatum [3H]mepyramine binding is unaffected by cerebral cortex ablation, nigral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine or brain stem hemisection. In the hippocampus, medial forebrain bundle lesions, intrahippocampal kainate injection, and fimbria and fornix transection largely fail to alter [3H]mepyramine binding. Accordingly, a major portion of these receptors may be associated with nonneuronal elements such as glia or blood vessels.", 
    "24": "The effect of a single dose of timolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride in fixed combination (Moducren; MSD) in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension was tested in an open study during 1978. Ninety-one and a half per cent of the patients studied responded with a fall in diastolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more. In 72% a single daily tablet of the combined preparation was sufficient to achieve and maintain control. Patient compliance was excellent and adverse reactions were generally of a minor nature.", 
    "25": "Cerebellar cyclic GMP levels can be altered by neurotransmitters and their receptor agonists and antagonists. In this study, we investigated the action of noradrenaline and certain drugs affecting alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors on rat cerebellaceptor agonists such as methoxamine and phenylephrine increased cGMP levels. alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists such as phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and ARC 239 decreased cGMP levels, whereas yohimbine and piperoxane which are known to act as presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists had no effect. The action of clonidine which decreased cGMP levels at low doses was probably due to the fact that this adrenoceptor agonist inhibited the release of noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve terminals, since piperoxane injected prior to clonidine antagonized the effect of clonidine on cerebellar cGMP, and since pretreatment of the animals with 6-hydroxydopamine partially antagonized the effect of clonidine. Isoproterenol, a beta-noradrenergic agonist had no effect on cerebellar cGMP levels. Propranolol, a beta-noradrenergic antagonist decreased cGMP levels. Phenoxybenzamine or propranolol injected prior to noradrenaline decreased cerebellar cGMP.", 
    "26": "Mitochondria isolated from rat liver after a short-term perfusion with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine or with glucagon exhibited enhanced rates of uptake of Ca2+ and prolonged retention of Ca2+ in the presence of 4mm-P(i). The effect of Ca2+ retention was apparent after perfusion with phenylephrine for only 1min and was maximal after 7min of treatment. The changes induced by glucagon, although similar, were less rapid. Adrenaline caused similar changes to phenylephrine and its effects were blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine, but not by the beta-antagonist propranolol. The Ca2+ content of the isolated mitochondria decreased by 30% 1min after the onset of perfusion with phenylephrine; by 6min it had begun to return to the original value which was reached at 10min. A similar loss in calcium content was induced by glucagon but the changes were not as great and occurred more slowly. Mitochondria from phenylephrine-treated livers exhibited decreased rates of Ca2+ efflux induced by addition of 2mm-EGTA, a 50% increase in the contents of ADP and total adenine nucleotides, a small increase in the transmembrane pH gradient, and a reduced rate of oxaloacetate-induced NADPH oxidation. This study thus shows that stimulation of liver by alpha-adrenergic agonists, like that by glucagon, induces within minutes a stable modification of mitochondria leading to alterations in the Ca2+-translocation cycle (increased Ca2+ uptake and retention) and alterations in mitochondrial energy-linked reactions.", 
    "27": "The authors investigate whether adenylate cyclase, that is a component of different receptors, i.e. the beta-adrenergic and H2-Histaminic ones of the heart, either plays a specific role for the activation of each receptor of forms the same pool for two types of receptors. On the mechanogram of guinea pig ventricle, stimulated by electric stimuli, an analysis of interferences among isoprenaline, propranolol, histamine and noradrenaline shows that isoprenaline inhibits histamine; in presence of propranolol the isoprenaline doesn't block histamine. Therefore the AA. conclude that adenylate cyclase is common to both receptors.", 
    "28": "The effects of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on the renal action of Dopamine (DA) in hydro-saline depletion were investigated in 9 healthy subjects. The beta-adrenergic blocking treatment was performed (Propranolol hydrochloride 2.4 mg/kg b.w. per day) during the 2 days preceding the renal function studies. For other experimental details, see our previous Note (11). In the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade DA effects in hydro-saline depletion consisted of: a) an increase in both RPF and GFR; b) a decrease in sodium abnormally isoosmotic reabsorption as % of sodium distal load; c) an increase in both sodium and osmolar clearances; d) an increase in free water clearance higher than that observed in the absence of blocking treatment. Therefore, the sympathomimetic effects of DA in hydro-saline depletion appear to be suppressed by beta-adrenergic blockade. It is suggested that such sympathomimetic action of DA may be mediated by beta-presynaptic receptors of noradrenergic nerve endings.", 
    "29": "On spontaneously beating guinea pig auricles, by assaying acetylcholine and beta-blockers alternate timing, opposite selective initial reactivity had been shown, partially independent of final steady state specific antagonism. Data related to cyclic receptor-sensitivity on acute versus subacute drug combination interaction had been presented.", 
    "30": "Complete final steady state selective antagonism by beta-blockers of different conventional classes versus acetylcholine effects on isolated frog rectus abdominis, guinea pig ileum and spontaneous beating auricles had been measured. The results do not support common beta-blockers groupings, nor binary conventional subdivision of \"nicotinic\" and \"muscarinic\" cholinergic receptors, confirming our previous findings.", 
    "31": "In the heart the interaction of the thyroid hormones, the catecholamines and the effect of the beta-blocker was studied. The binding of the radioactive noradrenalin (3H-NA) was higher in the particles of the thyreotoxic myocardium of the dog got by centrifugation at 1,000 and 78,000 g. The 3H-NA-binding was inhibited with propranolol, isoprenalin and in lower concentrations with trimepranol in dogs and also in rats. In the myocardium of the thyreotoxic dogs 3H-NA was less superseded with isoprenalin, in the myocardium of thyreotoxic rats less with non-active norarenalin in comparison to euthyroid animals. The thyreotoxicosis caused an increase of the activities of phosphorylase, of the lipases, of the calcium-dependent ATPase, the protein kinase in presence of histone, further a decrease of the activity of adenyl cyclase, particularly in presence of sodium fluoride and a decrease of the concentration of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the myocardium of the rats and dogs, respectively. The pharmacological thyreotoxicosis decreased the concentration of the heart glycogen. This decrease was inhibited by the beta-blocker trimepranol, but not by the alpha-blocker phentolamine. Three possibilities of the explanation of the findings of this complex study are cited. The influence of the thyroid hormones and beta-blockers 1. on the transport and calcium metabolism, 2. on the synthesis of the heart proteins, 3. on the backbinding control of the hormonal effect at cellular level.", 
    "32": "Intrathecal administration of norepinephrine (NE) into the lumbar subarachnoid space of rats and cats implanted with chronic spinal catheters produced a strong, dose-dependent, behaviorally defined analgesia. The effect appeared mediated by an alpha-receptor inasmuch as phenylephrine, but not isoproterenol produced the intrathecal effect. Moreover, the antinociceptive effect of NE was antagonized by the prior systemic or intrathecal administration of phentolamine (an alpha-blocker), but was unaffected by pretreatment with propranolol (a beta-blocker). The effect of intrathecal NE was significantly potentiated by prior administration of Lilly 51641 (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and protriptyline (a re-uptake inhibitor), and was not antagonized by the intrathecal administration of a non-specific vasodilator, papaverine. The antinociceptive effect of intrathecal NE showed tachyphylaxis following repeated injections. No cross-tolerance between intrathecal NE and morphine was observed, suggesting that the spinal action of morphine is not mediated by spinal noradrenergic terminals. Importantly, naloxone had no effect on the intrathecal NE effect. The present data provide further evidence for the modulatory role of a spinal noradrenergic system on the spinal processing of nociceptive transmission.", 
    "33": "Five hyperthyroid patients could be prepared for surgery wit propranolol alone in daily doses of 240 to 400 mg. The drug administered for 3 to 5 days before, and 5 to 15 days after the operation. Following premedication with levopromazine, almost total thyroidectomy was performed under neuroleptanalgesia and moderate hypothermia. The immediate results were satisfactory and free from acute thyrotoxic crisis. On follow-up, 2 to 18 months after surgery 4 patients had clinically and biologically normal thyroid function, and one patient showed evidence of hypothyroidism. For the common forms of the disease the authors use the conventional preparatory treatment. However, they favour a short course of propranolol in high doses either when non-thyroid emergency operations require preliminary treatment of the patient's hyperthyroidism, or when the conventional treatment is ineffective or contra-indicated on account of haematological complications.", 
    "34": "Tetracaine and other local anesthetics exert multiple actions on the catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system of frog erythrocyte membranes. Tetracaine (0.2--20 mM) reduces the responsiveness of adenylate cyclase to (a) guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate and (b) isoproterenol in the presence of GTP or guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate. Local anesthetics did not affect (a) basal enzyme activity, and (b) enzyme responsiveness to NaF. Tetracaine inhibited stimulation of adenylate cyclase by guanyl-5'-yl-imidodiphosphate over the whole range of nucleotide concentrations. By contrast, inhibition by tetracaine of isoproterenol activity in the presence of GTP was significant only if GTP concentrations exceeded 10(-7) M. Tetracaine also competitively inhibited binding of both the antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol and the agonist [3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol to beta-adrenergic receptors. However, it was twice as potent in inhibiting [3H]hydroxybenzylisoproterenol as [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. The greater potency for inhibition of agonist binding was due to the ability of the anesthetics to promote dissociation of the high-affinity nucleotide sensitive state of the beta-adrenergic receptor induced by agonists. Other local anesthetics mimicked the effects of tetracaine on adenylatecyclase and in dissociating high-affinity agonist-receptor complexes. The other of potency for both processes was dibucaine greater than tetracaine greater than bupivacaine greater than lidocaine which agrees with their relative potencies as local anesthetics. By contrast, a different order of potency was observed for competitive inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding: dibucaine greater than tetracaine greater than greater than lidocaine greater than bupivacaine.", 
    "35": "Phenylethylamine (PEA) has been implicated in a number of central and peripheral nervous system disorders. Its possible mechanisms of action include stimulation via catecholamine release and direct stimulation by PEA. We have examined the effects of PEA on isolated vascular smooth muscle (VSM) to further explore the mechanism by which PEA produces contraction in this tissue. Helical strips of rat aorta were suspended in a muscle bath. Smooth muscle contractions were recorded via force transducer. PEA elicited a concentration dependent contraction from these strips with a threshold near 10(-6) M and a maximum response at 5 X 10(-3) M. Pretreatment of rats with reserpine dramatically reduced the norepinephrine (NE) content of kidney, heart and spleen of these animals but did not prevent the action of PEA on VSM. The presence of phentolamine (10(-4) M) completely blocked the strip response to PEA. The presence of propranolol (10(-7) or 10(-4) M) altered but did not block the VSM response to PEA. These results argue that the effects of PEA upon the aortic strip preparation involve a direct action of this amine upon VSM.", 
    "36": "The depolarization (26 mM K+)-induced release of 3H-serotonin and 3H-noradrenaline from slices of rat hippocampus was studied with a superfusion method. Exogenous NA (in the presence of 10 muM desipramine) inhibited 3H-5-HT release (EC50 3 X 10(-7) M) as well as 3H-NA release (EC50 10(-7) M) by more than 70%. Both of these effects were competitively antagonized by phentolamine, but not by propranolol. It is tentatively suggested that the inhibitory effect of NA on 3H-5-HT release from hippocampus slices reflects the activation of postsynaptic alpha-receptors which are localized on serotonergic nerve terminals.", 
    "37": "The antihypertensive effects of intravenous (i.v.) and intracisternal (i.cist.) dl-propranolol were studied in anesthetized hypertensive dogs pretreated with i.cist. administered 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 600 micrograms/kg) one week previously. Acute neurogenic hypertension was elicited by sino-aortic denervation (deafferentation). In control (saline-pretreated) dogs, dl-propranolol given i.cist. (50 micrograms/kg) or i.v. (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) decreased both the rise in blood pressure and tachycardia induced by deafferentation. These hypotensive and negative chronotropic actions of i.v. (0.3 mg/kg) propranolol were suppressed by pretreatment with 6-OHDA. At a higher dose (1 mg/kg), i.v. propranolol always corrected hypertension and tachycardia in 6-OHDA-treated dogs as in control animals. After 6-OHDA, i.cist. propranolol (50 micrograms/kg) failed to decrease the rise in blood pressure in debuffered animals. Conversely, the bradycardia induced by i.cist. propranolol was more marked in 6-OHDA-treated dogs than in control animals. These results confirm that the antihypertensive action of propranolol can be partly explained by an action on the central nervous system. They support the hypothesis that the hypotension observed after intracisternal (and also after low does of i.v.) propranolol is dependent on the integrity of central catecholaminergic neurons. These studies suggest that the antihypertensive action of propranolol may be partly due to the blockade of central presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "38": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are an increasingly important class of drugs to the family physician. Diseases such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension and hyperthyroidism have responded dramatically to beta-blocking therapy. This article summarizes some of the current knowledge on the beta-receptor, the indications for beta-receptor blocking therapy, and the properties of the five beta-blocking agents currently available to Canadian physicians.", 
    "39": "We investigated the effect of isoproterenol on ciliary activity using a mucus-free preparation of cultured ciliated cells of the rabbit trachea. The frequency of ciliary beating was monitored by dynamic laser-scattering spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that isoproterenol directly stimulates the activity of ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium and that this effect is beta-adrenergic specific inasmuch as the observed stimulation can be blocked by propranolol.", 
    "40": "Timolol Maleate was successful in controlling the intraocular pressure in 59% of eyes with glaucoma. The addition of Pilocarpine or Epinephrine increased the total of eyes controlled to 86%.", 
    "41": "The results of treatment with Timoptol in 138 cases are reviewed. There was an average lowering of pressure by 6mm Hg in the whole group with an average follow up of 10 weeks (range 2-26 weeks). Most patients had a satisfactory fall only when Timoptol was combined with other treatment, with a fall of 3mm Hg or more in 60% of patients and with pressure controlled to less than 22mm Hg in 48 to 55%. A good response was achieved in all types of chronic open angle glaucoma except in low tension glaucoma. In established glaucoma it seems best to add Timoptol to the existing therapy and then modify treatment as indicated. Serious side effects occurred in five patients; 2 with severe pain, 2 with an attack of angle closure glaucoma, one a general sensitivity reaction and one with temporary central visual loss, but these do not detract from the immense potential of the drug in treatment of glaucoma.", 
    "42": "Many patients on long-term anti-glaucoma therapy were found to need better treatment because of lack of control and/or troublesome symptoms or signs. One hundred and ninety such patients with a wide range of glaucomas were observed during transfer to treatment with timolol maleate. This drug alone or in some combination, controlled two out of three patients. Some cases benefited from distinctive effects not easily provided by any other drug. Some patients were unresponsive and as time progressed an increasing number of early responders showed tachyphylaxis. As the result of experience in this series, timolol is not yet recommended for initial or cavalier use in all glaucomas or all patients. Because the drug is so new, special indications should be recognised by which timolol can be used selectively and with continuing caution for a further period.", 
    "43": "Five patients were treated with pindolol for various indications. The patients called attention to the appearance of fine tremors in their extremities 6-72 hr after starting treatment with the drug. The tremors disappeared 24-72 hr after stopping the drug. Beta-adrenoceptor-blockers are known to suppress different types of tremor and the paradoxical appearance of tremors during pindolol treatment is attributed to its powerful partial agonist activity. To the best of the authors' knowledge this side effect has not been previously described in the literature.", 
    "44": "Experience obtained in the treatment of 78 eyes of patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma with the beta-blocker Timolol 0.25% and 0.5%. Timolol was only given to patients whose intraocular pressure could no longer be adequately regulated by the medications previously employed. A synopsis is given of the medications used over many years. The intraocular pressures of the eyes that responded to Timolol remained below 23 mmHg even after prolonged use, so that a fistulizing operation was initially unnecessary.", 
    "45": "The action of Timolol, which lowers IOP in open-angle glaucoma, was investigated in patients with aphakic glaucoma and, with simultaneous administration of a miotic, in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Follow-ups, in some cases over periods of up to one year, showed that Timolol lowers IOP in almost all cases. Timolol alone reduced the pressure in 46% of the patients. Additional administration of other glaucoma drugs enabled IOP to be lowered to 22 mmHg or less in 82%. In five patients the pressure-lowering effect was unsatisfactory or, respectively, treatment with the drug had to be discontinued. All the patients had previously taken numerous pressure-lowering drugs without achieving adequate stabilization. In view of its minor side-effects and convenient mode of application (drops twice a day), Timolol should always be used in younger patients with wide chamber angles before surgery is contemplated.", 
    "46": "The pharmacokinetics of atenolol with and without the co-administration of chlorthalidone were studied in five hypertensive subjects. Concomitant administration of chlorthalidone appears to have little if any effect on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol during treatment for 7 days. The atenolol elimination half-lives were 6.7 +/- 1.1 and 6.3 +/- 0.9 h, respectively, with and without chlorthalidone. Two healthy volunteers also received a single 50 mg oral dose of chlorthalidone. Their blood profiles and pharmacokinetics were similar to those observed in hypertensive subjects, but a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) was found between the urinary excretion half-lives of chlorthalidone. This difference may be because chronic administration of the drug caused saturation of red cell binding.", 
    "47": "The effects of 80 microM dl-propranolol on left ventricular (LV) performance, energy stores, and creatine kinase (CK) release were studied in a modified Langendorff rabbit heart preparation during 75 min of aerobic perfusion and postanoxic reoxygenation. The data showed that this concentration of propranolol, which blocked the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation without affecting LV performance, coronary sinus flow (CSF), or oxygen consumption (MV O2), was associated with greater stores of glycogen and adenine nucleotides at the end of aerobic perfusion. Similar effects were observed during postanoxic reoxygenation, when recoveries of left ventricular systolic pressure, heart rate, heart rate--left ventricular systolic pressure product, CSF, and MV O2 remained unchanged during propranolol administration, but myocardial concentrations of glycogen, creatine phosphate, and ATP were greater and the ATP:AMP ratio and the energy charge were higher than in untreated hearts. In addition, the rate of CK loss was lower in the blocked postanoxic hearts than in the unblocked group. These results indicate that propranolol had a beneficial effect on cardiac metabolism during postanoxic recovery tending to normalize energy stores and to reduce enzyme loss during reoxygenation or perfused rabbit hearts without affecting mechanical performance, coronary flow, or O2 metabolism.", 
    "48": "Timolol has become so populat with ophthalmologists that it is prescribed 44% of the time when an anti-glaucoma drop is needed. This popularity is due to its newness and the publicity it has received, its effectiveness in most types of glaucoma, and the apparent scarcity of side effects. This paper looks at the first 489 patients treated with timolol at Wills Eye Hospital and the side effects encountered. These include blurring of vision, burning and pain, bradycardia and heart failure, hallucinations, dilated pupils, headaches, dizziness, hypotony, allergy, asthma, impotence, drowsiness, anxiety, emotional lability, and nausea.", 
    "49": "Five hundred forty-seven reports of adverse reactions to timolol maleate received by the National Registry for Drug-induced Ocular Side Effects during an eleven-month period were reviewed. Approximately half the reports concerned systemic reactions affecting the cardiac, pulmonary, central nervous, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic systems. Most serious were depression, anxiety, and confusion; bradycardia and arrhythmias; and pulmonary airway obstruction. Half of the ocular side effects concerned external ocular disease, of which superficial punctate keratitis and corneal anesthesia were the most remarkable. Ten percent of the reports described a visual disturbance which, in many cases, was not associated with refractive error.", 
    "50": "Comparison of effects of catecholamines (noradrenaline, adrenaline, and isopropyl-noradrenaline) on oxygen consumption and body temperature and study of influence of beta- and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents (poropranolol and phentolamine) on their calorigenic effects in cold- and warm-adapted rats revealed that affinity of propranolol and all the catecholamines to beta-adrenoreceptors is enhanced. Influence of propranolol on the cold thermogenesis involves thermoregulatory metabolism decrease in warm-adapted rats and additional (compensatory) increase of thermoregulatory electrical muscle activity in cold-adapted rats. The sympathetic regulation of heat production and its changes at prolonged cold adaptation seem to be mainly of beta-adrenergic nature.", 
    "51": "1. The effects of two beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, metoprolol and atenolol, on plasma lipoproteins were studied in thirty-four patients using a single-blind cross-over design, with a 10-day placebo washout period between drugs. 2. Compared with placebo values, neither metoprolol nor atenolol influenced total plasma cholesterol levels, while total plasma triglycerides increased slightly. 3. Low density lipoprotein protein level remained unaltered, while high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and protein were significantly reduced by both beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. 4. The ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol was increased by both drugs. 5. The data suggest that patients taking these drugs over many years may be exposing themselves to increased vascular risk, despite other anticipated benefits from such therapy."
