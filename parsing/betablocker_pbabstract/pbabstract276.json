No significant variations were detected in group P versus baseline. In particular, we observed in group A at 3 months of treatment a significant (P<0.05) decrease only in daytime BP in comparison with basal values and group P, without difference between the two phases of treatment. Indeed, the decrease in daytime BP was significant (P<0.05) for both systolic and diastolic BP.

    "45": "Recently, it has been shown that the fat-derived factor adiponectin is downregulated in insulin resistance and obesity and that replenishment of this adipocytokine reverses insulin resistance in mice. Growing evidence, on the other hand, suggests that raised levels of catecholamines due to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system are an integral part in the development of insulin resistance. To clarify whether catecholamines might exert their insulin resistance-inducing effects at least partly via downregulation of adiponectin gene expression, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with isoproterenol, and adiponectin mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In fact, isoproterenol treatment reduced the level of adiponectin mRNA by about 75% in a dose-dependent fashion with significant inhibition detectable at concentrations as low as 10 nM isoproterenol. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol was almost completely reversed by pretreatment of 3T3-L1 cells with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89. Moreover, the effects of isoproterenol could be mimicked by stimulation of stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding (G(S))-proteins with cholera toxin and adenylyl cyclase with forskolin. Thus, our results suggest that adiponectin gene expression is severely suppressed by beta-adrenergic agents via activation of a G(S)-protein-PKA-dependent pathway. The data support a possible role of adiponectin in catecholamine-induced insulin resistance.",

It increased the mRNAs of colligin, collagen I and III, and of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 as well as MMP-2 activity in two phases: In the initial phase, at 3 and 4 days, the mRNA of colligin and of collagen I and III was elevated predominantly in the LV, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 mRNA, as well as TIMP-2 protein and MMP-activity were increased in both ventricles. The second phase, after 14 days, was characterized by a less pronounced increase in colligin, collagen I and III and in MMP-2 activity which occurred exclusively in the LV. Finally, long-term treatment with NE induced a 37% increase in interstitial fibrosis which was shown to occur exclusively in the LV after 14 days.",

Included were patients with uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) > or =95 mmHg on treatment with a diuretic and a beta-blocker. Fifty-one patients received the combination of R and F, 54 patients R, and 53 patients F. The treatment goal was a DBP <90 mmHg and a similar BP reduction in the three groups. Mean doses at the last visit were 5+5, 10 and 9 mg, respectively, after a mean treatment time of nearly 2 years. The progression of renal impairment was studied by serial measurements of serum creatinine, iohexol clearance, and albuminuria.",

There was no significant difference between the groups. When correction for the acute drug effect was performed the R+F group had a slower progression rate of the renal disease (loss of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ml/min/year) compared with the F group (P<0.05) but not to the R group (P>0.20). There was a rise in albuminuria after 2 years in the F group (P<0.05), but no significant change was found in the other groups.", 
    "55": "In patients with non-diabetic renal disease the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a calcium antagonist in reduced doses used in addition to baseline therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics, tended to cause a better BP reduction as each drug per se. The R+F treatment also caused a slower progression of the renal disease compared with F alone. The combination treatment seems to afford better BP control and appears to be a favourable therapeutic option in patients with renal disease and hypertension.", 
    "56": "Expression of heat shock proteins (hsp) is a homeostatic mechanism induced in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in response to metabolic and environmental insults. A growing body of evidence suggests that in mammals, the hsp response is integrated with physiological responses through neuroendocrine signaling. In the present study, we have examined the effect of noradrenaline (NA) on the hsp70 response in mollusc immune cells. Oyster and abalone hemocytes transfected with a gene construct containing a gastropod hsp70 gene promoter linked to the luciferase reporter-gene were exposed to physiological concentrations of NA, or to various alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Results show that NA and alpha-adrenergic stimulations induced the expression of luciferase in transfected mollusc immunocytes. Furthermore, exposure of hemocytes to NA or to the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) resulted in the expression of the inducible isoform of the hsp70 protein. Pertussis toxin (PTX), the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C, the Ca(2+)-dependent PKC inhibitor G\u00f6 6976 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 blocked the PE-mediated induction of the hsp70 gene promoter. These results suggest that alpha-adrenergic signaling induces the transcriptionnal upregulation of hsp70 in mollusc hemocytes through a PTX-sensitive G-protein, PLC, Ca(2+)-dependent PKC and PI 3-kinase. Thus, a functional link exists between neuroendocrine signaling and the hsp70 response in mollusc immune cells.",

The effect of carvedilol on renal function, structure and expression of TGF beta and the matrix proteins fibronectin, collagen I and collagen III, was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rats fed a high fat, high salt diet. 2. Carvedilol treatment for 11 to 18 weeks did not alter systolic blood pressure in SHR-SP rats, however, it resulted in a significant reduction in heart rate. 3. Carvedilol treatment reduced renal fibrosis and total, active and chronic renal damage to levels approaching those of WKY rats on a normal diet. 4. Urinary protein excretion was higher in SHR-SP rats (51+/-10 mg day(-1)) than WKY rats (18+/-2 mg day(-1)) and this was further increased when SHR-SP rats were fed a high fat, high salt diet (251+/-120 mg day(-1)). Treatment with carvedilol resulted in significantly lower urinary protein excretion (37+/-15 mg day(-1)). 5. The expression of TGF beta mRNA was significantly higher in SHR-SP rats compared to WKY rats and a further increase was observed when rats were fed a high fat, high salt diet. Renal TGF beta expression was significantly reduced by treatment with carvedilol. The expression of fibronectin and collagen I and collagen III mRNA showed a pattern similar to that observed with TGF beta mRNA expression. Collagen I mRNA expression followed a pattern similar to renal fibrosis. 6. These data indicate that carvedilol can provide significant renal protection in the absence of any antihypertensive activity and that the mechanisms involved in this action may include reduced expression of profibrotic factors such as TGF beta.", 
    "58": "Various techniques to induce deliberate hypotension (DH) have different influences on splanchnic perfusion. The aim of our study was to determine whether splanchnic perfusion is clinically impaired during DH by using either isoflurane (ISO) or a combination of esmolol and nitroglycerin (E/N). We randomized 16 patients undergoing elective maxillofacial surgery to receive either ISO (0.7%-1.8%) or E (105 g x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and N (1-6 mg/h) to induce DH. General anesthesia was performed in both groups by IV midazolam 0.07 mg/kg, fentanyl 0.003 mg/kg, propofol 1.5 mg/kg, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg followed by a propofol infusion with 6 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). After the induction of anesthesia, a gastric tonometer (TRIP NGS Catheter) and a radial artery catheter were inserted. Baseline values of gastric intramucosal pH (pHi) were determined 60 min after placement of the catheter and before the induction of DH. The pHi values were calculated every 60 min until DH was discontinued. In both groups, DH was satisfactorily established. None of the pHi values calculated was less than 7.37 in the E/N or 7.41 in the ISO group. Arterial blood lactate levels did not increase in any of the patients. We conclude that neither method of producing DH compromises splanchnic tissue oxygen balance in healthy patients. Furthermore, overall organ perfusion was sufficient in both groups, because none of the patients showed an increase in blood lactate.",

    "60": "Extracellular ATP has been known to have many functions as a fast transmitter, and a co-transmitter, and to have morphogenic and mitogenic activity in neuronal cells. Although it was reported that ATP activates phospholipase D (PLD), the role of PLD versus the ATP function was unclear in neuronal cells. In this study, we investigated the role of PLD on the ATP-induced extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation and mitogenic effect in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. In these cells ATP caused PLD2 activation and ERK phosphorylation, which was dramatically reduced by wild-type PLD2-overexpression but not by lipase-inactive-mutant PLD2-overexpression. The accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA) by preincubating PC12 cells with propranolol (an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase) also decreased the ERK phosphorylation. Inhibition of phosphatases by okadaic acid or pervanadate completely blocked PLD2-dependent ERK dephosphorylation. In addition, ATP-stimulated thymidine incorporation was reduced by the overexpression of wild-type PLD2, but not by the overexpression of lipase-inactive-mutant PLD2. Okadaic acid pretreatment overcame the decrease of ATP-induced thymidine incorporation by PLD2 overexpression. Taken together, we suggest that PLD2 activity might play a negative role in ATP-induced ERK phosphorylation and mitogenic signal possibly through phosphatases.", 
    "61": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in dogs is characterized by ventricular and atrial enlargement, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, with congestive heart failure (CHF) often developing at some stage. With greater understanding of the impact of neuroendocrine stimulation in heart disease, the understanding of the pathophysiology for CHF has changed considerably. It is no longer considered only to be a simple haemodynamic consequence of pump dysfunction, but is now characterized as a complex clinical syndrome with release of many neurohormones, which are believed to have impact on the progression of disease. This change in our understanding of the pathophysiology of CHF has important therapeutic implications. There are strong indications, although not yet proven, that drugs designed to influence the neuroendocrine activity, such as Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-receptors antagonists, are efficacious as adjunct therapy of heart failure attributable to DCM in dogs. The benefits of drugs designed to influence the myocardial contractile state (positive inotropes) have not been fully evaluated. However, evidence has emerged in recent years indicating that new types of positive inotropes may be beneficial in dogs with DCM. This review focuses on the neuroendocrine aspects of DCM and their possible therapeutic implications and the place for long-term inotropic support in dogs with DCM.",

Phosphoprotein determination after beta-adrenergic stimulation demonstrated that the levels of Ser16 and Thr17 phosphorylated phospholamban in atria remained at about one-third of that in ventricles. However, comparison of sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-uptake in control and isoproterenol perfused preparations demonstrated that the effect of beta-adrenergic stimulation on sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-uptake was stronger in atrial preparations. Moreover, atria responded to isoproterenol with much larger increases in developed tension, contractility and relaxation rates than papillary muscles. Thus, despite lower level of phospholamban, the beta-adrenergic activation of sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-uptake and contractile indices are higher in atria.",

The visual field was evaluated (Octopus 2000 perimeter, G1 program) examining the mean sensitivity (MS) and the mean defect (MD). CDI was carried out to evaluate the resistance index of the internal carotid artery (ICA), the ophthalmic artery (OA), the central retinal artery (CRA), and the short posterior ciliary arteries (SPCA). After these examinations, the therapy was changed to carteolol 2% twice a day. After six months of treatment the examinations were repeated. The data were analysed statistically using Student's t test.",

After six months of treatment with carteolol 2% the MS increased significantly from 22.4 +/- 2.5 dB to 24.1 +/- 1.8 dB (p=0.018), and the mean defect (MD) fell from 5.3 +/- 0.8 dB to 4.7 +/- 0.6 dB (p=0.011). There was no significant difference in the resistance index of the CA, the OA and the CRA with the two treatments, whereas the resistance index of the SPCA dropped significantly, from 0.80 +/- 0.05 to 0.77 +/- 0.02 (p = 0.017).", 
    "66": "CDI did not show significant differences in the resistance indexes of the internal CA, the OA, and the CRA after treatment with carteolol 2% but the resistance index of the SPCA was significantly reduced. Carteolol 2% induced significant changes in the perimetric indexes examined, with an increase in MS and a decrease in MD. These findings suggest that the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of carteolol may reduce peripheral vascular resistance of the SCA, thus improving perfusion of the optic nerve head, with a protective effect on visual function.",

Modern beta blockers are safe drugs with a low profile of side effects, which, applied with proper consideration being given to contraindications, rarely produce serious side effects such as bradyarrhythmia, bronchial obstruction, or aggravation of heart failure. Their prognostic benefit, for example, in the treatment of post-myocardial infarction patients, or in cardiac insufficiency, has been demonstrated in large randomized clinical trials.", 
    "68": "We studied the effects of adrenergic agents on the five main cell types of the rat anterior pituitary by monitoring the changes of the cytosolic free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) in single cells that were identified by multiple sequential primary immunocytochemistry at the end of the Ca2+ measurements. Adrenaline (100 nM) increased [Ca2+]i in 30% of the cells. Responses were most prominent in somatotrophs and corticotrophs (40-65% of the cells responded) whereas the other three cell types, lactotrophs, thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs, gave poorer responses. Selective agonists and antagonists revealed the presence of both alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors. Alpha1-receptors dominated in corticotrophs, beta-receptors in somatotrophs. The alpha1-adrenergic responses increased with culture of the cells. The beta-adrenergic responses were mediated by cAMP and consisted of stimulation of Ca2+ entry through L-type voltage-gated channels. Stimulation of alpha1-receptors released Ca2+ from intracellular stores in corticotrophs and induced cAMP-independent Ca2+ entry in somatotrophs. The effects of alpha1-agonists were additive with those of the releasing factors growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) whereas those of the beta-agonists were not. Our results suggest that direct effects of plasma catecholamines on AP cells may contribute to the hormonal response to stress.", 
    "69": "Although i.v. t-PA has proven successful in reducing neurologic deficits in acute ischemic stroke, the disadvantages of a narrow therapeutic time window and the failure of thrombolysis in more than 50% of patients treated have necessitated an examination of adjuvant therapies to improve the rate of thrombolysis. Experimentally, the combination of aspirin therapy with t-PA has resulted in a paradoxical antagonism of thrombolysis. Reversal of this antagonism with nitric oxide (NO) donors suggested that aspirin may inhibit/ antagonize NO-related mechanisms. Using this rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke, this hypothesis is now expanded to compare two clinically relevant anti-hypertensive agents, atenolol (NO-dependent) and hydralazine (NO-independent), for their ability to improve t-PA-mediated clot lysis following aspirin pre-treatment. Thirty rabbits (10 per group) were pre-treated with aspirin (20mg kg(-1), i.v.) and then randomized to receive either vehicle, atenolol (20 microg kg(-1) h(-1), i.v.) or hydralazine (10 microg kg(-1) min(-1), i.v.) beginning 30 min following autologous clot embolization. All rabbits then received t-PA (6.3 mg kg(-1), i.v.) beginning 1 h after embolization, with completion of the protocol 4 h after embolization. Aspirin therapy reduced regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) from 82.8m +/- 4.7 to 62.5 +/- 6.6 (n = 30; p = 0.0005). In the aspirin control group only 30% (3 of 10) rabbits demonstrated complete clot lysis, whereas the combined atenolol (60%) and hydralazine (70%) groups experienced a clot lysis rate of 65% (13 of 20 rabbits), similar to clot lysis rates previously observed with t-PA alone. In a separate series of experiments, all agents able to reverse aspirin antagonism of thrombolysis demonstrated an improvement in rCBF, suggesting a common mechanism for this diverse group of agents in reversing aspirin's antagonism of thrombolysis.",

This report describes how a recently developed method, fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA), can be used to develop homogeneous, nonradioactive high throughput screening assays for membrane receptors. With FIDA, free ligand and ligand accumulated on receptor-bearing membrane vesicles can be distinguished on the basis of their particle brightness. This allows the concentration of both bound and free ligand to be determined reliably from a single measurement, without any separation. We demonstrate that ligand affinity, receptor expression level, and potency of inhibitors can be determined using the epidermal growth factor and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors as model systems. Highly focused confocal optics enable single-molecule sensitivity, and sample volumes can thus be reduced to 1 microl without affecting the quality of the fluorescence signal. Our results demonstrate that FIDA is an ideal method for membrane receptor assays offering substantial benefits for assay development and high throughput pharmaceutical screening.",

To characterize the actions of these THA analogs and the function of EAAT4 and EAAT5, we performed electrophysiological analyses in EAAT4 or EAAT5 expressed on Xenopus oocytes. In EAAT4-expressing oocytes, D,L-TBOA acted as a non-transportable blocker, while L-TMOA like D,L-THA was a competitive substrate. In contrast, D,L-THA, D,L-TBOA and L-TMOA all strongly attenuated the glutamate-induced currents generated by EAAT5. Among them, L-TMOA showed the most potent inhibitory action. Moreover, D,L-THA, D,L-TBOA and L-TMOA themselves elicited outward currents at negative potentials and remained inward at positive potentials suggesting that D,L-TBOA and L-TMOA, as well as D,L-THA, not only act as non-transportable blockers, but also block the EAAT5 leak currents. These results indicate that EAATs 4 and 5 show different sensitivities to THA analogs although they share properties of a glutamate-gated chloride channel.", 
    "86": "The serotonin transporter (SERT) is a high-affinity sodium/chloride-dependent neurotransmitter transporter responsible for reuptake of serotonin from the extracellular space. SERT is a selective target of several clinically important antidepressants. In a cross-species analysis comparing human and bovine SERTs, the kinetic parameters for serotonin uptake were found to be similar, however, the pharmacological profiles of the two transporters differ. Following transient expression in COS-1 cells, IC(50) values were determined for several antidepressants and psychostimulants. The potencies of the antidepressants citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and imipramine were several-fold higher at hSERT compared with bSERT. No species selectivity was observed for the antidepressants fluvoxamine, and sertraline or for the psychostimulants cocaine, the cocaine analogue beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane, or for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Analysis of six hSERT/bSERT chimeras and subsequent species-scanning mutagenesis of each isoform revealed methionine-180, tyrosine-495, and phenylalanine-513 to be responsible for the increase in citalopram and paroxetine potencies at hSERT and methionine-180 and phenylalanine-513 to confer species selectivity at hSERT for fluoxetine and imipramine. Results were obtained by doing the forward, bovine to human, mutations and confirmed by doing the reverse mutations. Citalopram analogues were used to define the roles of methionine-180, tyrosine-495, and phenylalanine-513 and to reveal molecular interactions with individual functional groups of citalopram. We suggest that methionine-180 interacts with the heterocyclic nucleus of citalopram or stabilizes the binding pocket and phenylalanine-513 to be a steric blocker of antidepressant recognition.", 
    "87": "The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the available data linking antihypertensive drug therapy to cancer risk. In recent years, a number of mainly retrospective studies have reached different conclusions on the risk of cancer in patients with hypertension being treated with different antihypertensive drugs. At some point or another nearly all antihypertensive drugs have been suggested to increase the risk of cancer. Some studies have even found an association between hypertension itself and increased carcinogenesis. For calcium channel antagonists, beta-blockers and alpha-blockers, the available evidence seems to favour a neutral effect on cancer development and death rate. For ACE inhibitors, the overall data suggest a similar neutral effect on cancer or, possibly, a small protective effect. Perhaps the strongest evidence in favour of a link, although probably weak, between cancer and antihypertensive drugs is with the diuretics. Until further solid data are available from prospective clinical trials, we suggest that the management of hypertension should continue according to current treatment guidelines with little fear of any substantial cancer risk.",

Dexamethasone was employed as an enhancer of PEPCK gene transcription. Nipradilol, but not timolol (a beta-blocker without a nitroxy moiety), attenuated PEPCK gene transcription both in the control and the dexamethasone-treated cells. The effects of nipradilol were eradicated by methylene blue (an inhibitor of cellular guanylate cyclase). Nipradilol is a unique beta-blocker that suppresses PEPCK gene transcription in hepatocytes likely through liberation of nitric oxide and resultant activation of guanylate cyclase.",

After a one-week single blind placebo run-in period, the patients underwent ABPM if their clinic diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranged from 90-109 mmHg and their clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) was <180 mmHg. They were divided into two groups according to the absence (non-dipper group, 24 cases) or presence (dipper group, 23 cases) of nocturnal BP reduction > or =10% of daytime BP. ABPM was measured again at the end of the active treatment phase. All patients were given Arotinolol 10-20 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Twenty four-hour systolic and diastolic average BPs (MSBP, MDBP), 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure load (LS BP, LDBP), daytime systolic and diastolic average BPs (dMSBP, dMDBP), daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure load (dLSBP, dLDBP), nighttime systolic and diastolic average BPs (nMSBP, nMDBP) and nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressure load (nLSBP, nLDBP) were calculated. Arotinolol was effective in 78.2% of dippers and 54.2% of non-dippers, but the difference in effectiveness between these groups was not statistically significant. After treatment, SBP and DBP-including 24-h, daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic BPs- were significantly reduced in both groups. During the daytime period, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced in both dippers and non-dippers, while nighttime systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly reduced only in the non-dipper group. No significant changes were found in the dipper group over this period. In conclusion, Arotinolol, which can be dosed twice daily, is an effective antihypertensive agent which effectively lowers blood pressure during the day while reducing nighttime blood pressure more in non-dippers than in dippers, without excessive lowering blood pressure in the latter.", 
    "90": "Separations of basic drug enantiomers have been investigated using glucuronyl glucosyl beta-cyclodextrin (GUG beta-CD) as a chiral selector in the background electrolyte by capillary zone electrophoresis. The effects of GUG beta-CD concentration and running buffer pH on the migration times and resolution of 16 basic drug enantiomers were precisely examined using a linear polyacrylamide-coated capillary. High resolution of 16 basic drug enantiomers was generally attained with a running buffer pH 2.5 or 3.5 containing 10 mM GUG beta-CD. Next, we compared the chiral resolution abilities of GUG beta-CD with those of beta-CD and maltosyl beta-CD (G2 beta-CD). GUG beta-CD showed higher resolution for basic drug enantiomers tested than beta-CD and G2 beta-CD. This could be due to that hydrogen bonding or ionic interactions of uncharged and charged glucuronyl glucosyl groups of GUG beta-CD with an analyte could stabilize the inclusion complex.", 
    "91": "Extracellular ATP has been known to modulate various cellular responses including mitogenesis, secretion and morphogenic activity in neuronal cells. In the ATP-induced morphogenic activity, focal adhesion kinase(s) such as Fak have been suggested to play a critical role. Binding of ATP to its specific cell surface receptor in PC12 cells induces phospholipase D (PLD) activity. However, the role of PLD on ATP-induced Fak activation in PC12 cells remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of PLD on the ATP-induced Fak activation and paxillin phosphorylation using two established cell lines: wild type PLD2- and lipase-inactive mutant PLD2-inducible PC12 cells. Stimulation of cells with ATP caused PLD2 activation via classical protein kinase C activation. ATP also induced Fak activation, and paxillin phosphorylation, and were dramatically reduced by wild type PLD2 overexpression but not by lipase-inactive mutant PLD2 overexpression. When the PC12 cells were pretreated with propranolol, a specific inhibitor for phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase resulting in the accumulation of PA, ATP-induced Fak activation and paxillin phosphorylation were also reduced. We found that inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases by pervanadate completely blocked PLD2-dependent Fak and paxillin dephosphorylation. Taken together, we suggest that PLD2 activity might play a negative role in ATP-induced Fak and paxillin phosphorylation possibly through tyrosine phosphatases.",

Since 1994, there have been significant improvements in the use of aspirin and beta-blockers at discharge, and avoidance of calcium channel blockers in those patients with poor left ventricular function. Documentation of smoking cessation counseling decreased significantly from 1994 to 1998. Other measures of quality of care did not change significantly.

    "102": "Activity of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels controls membrane potential (E(m)). Membrane depolarization due to blockade of K+ channels in mesenteric artery smooth muscle cells (MASMC) should increase cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) and cause vasoconstriction, which may subsequently reduce the mesenteric blood flow and inhibit the transportation of absorbed nutrients to the liver and adipose tissue. In this study, we characterized and compared the electrophysiological properties and molecular identities of Kv channels and examined the role of Kv channel function in regulating E(m) in MASMC and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). MASMC and IEC functionally expressed multiple Kv channel alpha- and beta-subunits (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, Kv4.3, and Kv9.3, as well as Kvbeta1.1, Kvbeta2.1, and Kvbeta3), but only MASMC expressed voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The current density and the activation and inactivation kinetics of whole cell Kv currents were similar in MASMC and IEC. Extracellular application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a Kv-channel blocker, reduced whole cell Kv currents and caused E(m) depolarization in both MASMC and IEC. The 4-AP-induced E(m) depolarization increased [Ca2+]cyt in MASMC and caused mesenteric vasoconstriction. Furthermore, ingestion of 4-AP significantly reduced the weight gain in rats. These results suggest that MASMC and IEC express multiple Kv channel alpha- and beta-subunits. The function of these Kv channels plays an important role in controlling E(m). The membrane depolarization-mediated increase in [Ca2+]cyt in MASMC and mesenteric vasoconstriction may inhibit transportation of absorbed nutrients via mesenteric circulation and limit weight gain.", 
    "103": "The author reviews the various factors (sodium, aldosterone, renin-angiotensin system, and norepinephrine; each of these factors being influenced by others) involved in the mechanism of human hypertension. A coherent picture is emerging, with the final pathway of these mechanisms converging on the renin-angiotensin system in the presence of a positive sodium balance and responsible for arteriolar resistance and responsiveness to pressor agents. This would correspond to the labile phase of hypertension, which leads with time to arteriolar restructuring and the increased media/lumen ratio, as demonstrated by Schiffrin and coworkers, and which can revert to normal structure with the administration of antihypertensive drugs such as converting-enzyme inhibitors, calcium-blocking drugs, and antagonists of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. The author also presents the experience obtained in the Hypertension Clinic of the Clinical Research Institute of Montr\u00e9al, which has been in existence since 1953; this experience is based on the observation of senior observers (clinical scientists, clinicians, and nurses) that the blood pressure of hypertensive patients can be controlled to normal levels in almost all cases for years and decades with a proper combination of the present antihypertensive drugs.",

Little is known, however, of the comparative effects of various classes of antihypertensive agents on pulse pressure. In retrospective analyses of the Veterans Affairs Single-Drug Therapy for Hypertension Study, we compared changes in pulse pressure with 6 classes of antihypertensive agents: 1292 men with diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 109 mm Hg on placebo were randomized to receive hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, prazosin, or placebo. Drug doses were titrated to achieve a goal diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg during a 4- to 8-week medication titration phase. Pulse pressure change (placebo subtracted) was assessed from baseline to the end of the 3-month titration and 1-year maintenance. Mean baseline systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures were 152, 99, and 53 mm Hg, respectively. Reductions in pulse pressure during titration were greater (P<0.001) with clonidine (6.7 mm Hg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6.2 mm Hg) than with captopril (2.5 mm Hg), diltiazem (1.6 mm Hg), and atenolol (1.4 mm Hg); reduction with prazosin (3.9 mm Hg) was similar to all but clonidine. After 1 year, pulse pressure was reduced significantly more (P<0.001) with hydrochlorothiazide (8.6 mm Hg) than with captopril and atenolol (4.1 mm Hg with both); clonidine (6.3 mm Hg), diltiazem (5.5 mm Hg), and prazosin (5.0 mm Hg) were intermediate. These data show that classes of antihypertensive agents differ in their ability to reduce pulse pressure. Whether these differences affect rates of cardiovascular events remains to be determined.", 
    "105": "International guidelines recommend that antihypertensive drug therapy should normalize not only diastolic (DBP) but also systolic blood pressure (SBP). Therapeutic trials based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that SBP reduction requires normalization of both large artery stiffness and wave reflections. The aim of the present study was to compare the antihypertensive effects of the very-low-dose combination indapamide (0.625 mg) and perindopril (2 mg) (Per/Ind) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol (50 mg) to determine whether Per/Ind decreases SBP and pulse pressure (PP) more than does atenolol and, if so, whether this decrease is predominantly due to reduction of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) (automatic measurements) and reduction of wave reflections (pulse wave analysis, applanation tonometry). In a double-blind randomized study, 471 patients with essential hypertension were followed for 12 months. For the same DBP reduction, Per/Ind decreased brachial SBP (-6.02 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -8.90 to -3.14) and PP (-5.57; 95% confidence interval, -7.70 to -3.44) significantly more than did atenolol. This difference was significantly more pronounced for the carotid artery than for the brachial artery. Whereas the 2 antihypertensive agents decreased PWV to a similar degree, only Per/Ind significantly attenuated carotid wave reflections, resulting in a selective decrease in SBP and PP. The very-low-dose combination Per/Ind normalizes SBP, PP, and arterial function to a significantly larger extent than does atenolol, a hemodynamic profile that is known to improve survival in hypertensive populations with high cardiovascular risk.",

Studies in animal models have shown that repeated cycles of fasting-refeeding may cause or exacerbate hypertension. Changes in sleeping patterns as well as changes in medication timing may also influence ambulatory blood pressure. We undertook this study in order to examine the effect of the Ramadan fast on treated hypertensive subjects. Seventeen hypertensive subjects were examined, and 24-h blood pressure monitoring was carried out twice, before and during the last week of the Ramadan. All continued their medications, which were all once-daily preparations. Twenty-four hour mean blood pressure as well as average awake and average asleep blood pressure were compared. There was no difference between mean blood pressure before and during the Ramadan (138.5 +/- 18.5/77.2 +/- 8.1 mm Hg vs 136.4 +/- 20.4/75.7 +/- 5.9 mm Hg, P-nonsignificant). Blood pressure load also did not differ before and during Ramadan (systolic load 49% vs. 44%, diastolic load 21% vs. 18%, P-nonsignificant). Weight was reduced by 1.4 +/- 1.6 kg (P < 0.002).

As new pharmacologic therapies become available, such as beta-blockers and natriuretic peptides, the combinatorial use of agents for the treatment of patients with decompensated heart failure presents new opportunities with potentially reduced toxicities. Finally, given the natural history of patients with advanced heart failure, it behooves all caregivers to understand the wishes and preferences of the patients who face life-threatening decompensation.

When patients receiving beta-blockers decompensate they often need treatment with a positive inotropic agent. The beta-agonist dobutamine may not produce much increase in cardiac output during full-dose beta-blocker treatment and may increase systemic vascular resistance via alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (PDEIs) such as milrinone or enoximone retain full hemodynamic effects during complete beta-blockade because the site of action of PDEIs is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor and because beta-blockade reverses some of the desensitization phenomena that account for the attenuation of PDEI response in heart failure related to upregulation in G(alphai). Inotrope-requiring subjects with decompensated heart failure who are undergoing long-term therapy with beta-blocking agents should be treated with a type III-specific PDEI, not a beta-agonist such as dobutamine.",

    "135": "Reported clinical and experimental findings have shown that baroreflex control of heart rate is attenuated in women compared with men. This study investigated whether the sexual dimorphism in baroreflex function relates to the ability of the male hormone testosterone to facilitate baroreflex responsiveness. Relative contributions of the vagal and sympathetic autonomic components to testosterone modulation of baroreflex function were also investigated. Baroreflex curves relating changes in heart rate to increases or decreases in blood pressure evoked by phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively, were constructed in sham-operated rats and castrated rats with and without testosterone replacement. Slope of the curves was taken as an index of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS PE and BRS NP ). Castration (for 10 days) significantly reduced plasma testosterone levels and attenuated reflex bradycardia, as indicated by significantly smaller BRS PE in castrated rats compared with values in sham-operated rats (-0.85 +/- 0.07 vs. -1.51 +/- 0.10 beats/min per mm Hg). Testosterone replacement in castrated rats restored plasma testosterone and BRS PE to levels similar to those of sham-operated rats. Muscarinic blockade by atropine caused 55% reduction in BRS PE in sham-operated rats, an effect that was significantly (p < 0.05) attenuated in castrated rats and restored to intact levels after testosterone supplementation. beta-Adrenergic blockade by propranolol caused slight and insignificant decreases in BRS PE. Castration and testosterone supplementation had no effect on BRS NP, ruling out a modulatory effect of testosterone on reflex tachycardia. These data provide the first experimental evidence of a favorable role for testosterone in baroreceptor control of reflex bradycardia. Further, baroreflex modulation by testosterone appears to be autonomically mediated and involves an enhancement of cardiomotor vagal activity.", 
    "136": "Oxygen free radicals play an important role in several physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. In pathophysiologic circumstances they can modify and damage biologic systems. Their functional properties (exposed to high oxygen tension) place red blood cells among the most susceptible cells to the harmful effect of free radicals. Because oxygen free radicals are involved in a wide range of diseases, scavenging these radicals should be an important therapeutic approach. In this study the antioxidant capacities of experimental and clinically used cardiovascular drugs were investigated. Phenazine methosulfate was used to generate free radicals and thus harden red blood cells. Filtration technique and potassium leaking were used to detect the scavenging effect of the examined drugs. The experimental drug H-2545 provided 43% protection against phenazine methosulfate-induced changes in red blood cell filterability (p < 0.001). Although some of the examined, clinically used cardiovascular drugs (carvedilol, metoprolol, verapamil, trimetazidine) also showed significant (p < 0.05) antioxidant effect, they were less efficient than H-2545. The scavenger effect of this novel drug exceeded the antioxidant properties of vitamin E. Modification of mexiletine with a pyrroline ring significantly improved its antioxidant capacity, suggesting that this molecular segment is responsible for the antioxidant effect.", 
    "137": "The present study was designed to investigate, in patients with severe heart failure, the dose-dependent acute hemodynamic effects of celiprolol versus those of esmolol. Celiprolol is a beta 1 -receptor blocker with vasodilating properties, whereas esmolol is an ultra-short-acting beta 1 -blocker. Included were 14 patients with decompensated chronic heart failure (NYHA class IV) due to coronary heart disease (n = 8) or to dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6). Each patient received both celiprolol and esmolol in random fashion. The beta-blockers were administered in four dose tiers, with an increase in dosage every 15 min. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained with a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter. Administration of celiprolol (5, 10, 20, and 50 microg/kg) took place intravenously. After intravenous administration of a loading dose of 500 microg/kg, we continuously infused esmolol at increasing doses, which were individually titrated for each patient. Mean infusion rates of esmolol were as follows: 40, 75, 140, and 230 micromol/kg per minute. Celiprolol and esmolol induced a comparable dose-dependent decrease in heart rate to a minimum of -10% below baseline. Esmolol caused a significant dose-dependent decrease (-25% below baseline at the highest dose level) in cardiac index (CI). After administration of celiprolol, CI decreased only transiently (-10% below baseline at the second and third dose level) and did not differ from the baseline at the highest dose level. For treatment of severe heart failure, initiation of intravenous beta-blocker therapy with low doses of a beta 1 -blocker with vasodilating effects may have hemodynamic advantages over conventional beta-blockade.", 
    "138": "The functional characteristics of the alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes in human resistance arteries are still not clear. We recently reported that the alpha1A-adrenoceptor predominantly mediates contraction to norepinephrine in human skeletal muscle resistance arteries. In this study we extended these investigations to human subcutaneous resistance arteries. Arterial segments were isolated from the inguinal subcutaneous fat and mounted on a small vessel wire myograph. Potencies of agonists and antagonists were examined. N-[5-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2yl)-2-hydroxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl]methanesulphonamide (A-61603) was found to be 10- and 54-fold more potent than norepinephrine and phenylephrine, respectively. Brimonidine (UK 14304) evoked significantly smaller contractile responses than norepinephrine and phenylephrine, showing the presence of a small population of alpha2-adrenoceptors in these arteries, and this was confirmed by the studies with selective alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and (8aR,12aS,13aS)-5,8,8a,9,10,11,12,12a,13a-decahydro-3-methoxyl-12-(ethylsulphonyl)-6H-isoquino[2,1-g][1,6]-naphthyridine (RS 79948). Prazosin, 5-methyl-urapidil, and 2-[2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl]aminomethyl)-1,4-benzodioxane (WB 4101) shifted the potency of norepinephrine concentration dependently giving pA2 values of 9.4, 8.9, and 10.1, respectively, showing the presence of the alpha1A-subtype in these arteries. Pretreatment with 1 and 10 microM chloroethylclonidine did not affect the potency of and maximum responses to norepinephrine, ruling out the presence of the alpha1B-subtype in these arteries. 8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione (BMY 7378, 10 and 100 nM) did not affect the potency of norepinephrine but a small shift was observed by 1 microM BMY 7378, giving a pK(B) value of 7.1, much less than that reported for the alpha1D-subtype. These results suggest the predominant involvement of alpha1A-adrenoceptor in the contractile responses to norepinephrine in these arteries. The physiological role of this subtype in the maintenance of peripheral arterial resistance is yet to be confirmed.", 
    "139": "A series of 1\"-mono-, di-, and trifluorinated analogs of propranolol and related steric congeners was prepared, and their metabolism was examined with recombinant-expressed CYP1A2. The structural changes in this series of compounds, principally added fluorines and methyl groups in the 1\"-position of the N-isopropyl group, provided compounds that varied in pK(a) by more than 5 log units, in log D by 3 log units, and in size of the added substituents. N-Dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation (formation of the 4'- and 5'-regioisomers) were catalyzed by CYP1A2. Correlations of the metabolic kinetic parameters K(m) and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) with physicochemical properties pK(a) and log D showed that increased lipophilicity (higher log D values) was associated with increased affinity (lower K(m)) and increased catalytic efficiency for CYP1A2. Comparison of log K(m) and log k(cat)/K(m) with pK(a) showed that the less basic analogs had higher affinities and increased catalytic efficiencies. The changes associated with pK(a) reflect increased lipid partitioning of substrate (increased log D) caused by an increase in the proportion of nonionized substrate. Increased steric bulk in the N-substituent alone did not decrease substrate affinity for CYP1A2 but did increase the amount of aromatic hydroxylation versus N-dealkylation. Removal of the hydroxyl group from the propanolamine side chain of propranolol resulted in a similar change in regioselectivity of metabolism.",

The structural changes in this series of compounds, principally added fluorines and methyl groups in the 1\"-position of the N-isopropyl group, provided compounds that varied in pK(a) by more than 5 log units and also varied in lipophilicity and in steric size. Products of both aromatic hydroxylation and N-dealkylation were observed in the metabolic experiments. The regiochemistry of aromatic hydroxylation at the 4'- and 5'-positions was assigned based on high-pressure liquid chromatography, fluorescence, and mass spectral characteristics of the products and standards. Correlations of the metabolic kinetic parameters K(m) and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) with substituent parameters of the added groups showed that increased basicity (higher pK(a) values) was associated with increased enzyme affinity (low K(m) values) and increased catalytic efficiency. More basic methyl-substituted compounds showed higher affinities for CYP2D6 than the structurally analogous less basic fluorinated congeners, indicating the decrease in affinity of the fluorinated compounds was not due to the size of the N-alkyl substituent. Correlations with log D reflected the degree of ionization and showed that the less lipophilic substrates (more basic compounds) had higher affinity for CYP2D6. These results are consistent with the proposal in the literature that ion pairing of the protonated amine of the substrate with Asp301 in the active site of CYP2D6 is very important to substrate affinity.",

MTX produced a concentration-dependent elevation of [Ca(2+)]i in a Ca(2+)-containing medium. This effect was stimulated by pretreatment with YTX 1 microM and NiCl(2) 15 microM. The voltage-independent Ca(2+) channel antagonist 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxyl]-4-methoxyphenyl]-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SKF96365) blocked the MTX-induced [Ca(2+)]i elevation, while the L-type channel blocker nifedipine had no effect. Pretreatment with NiCl(2) or nifedipine did not modify YTX-induced potentiation of MTX effect, and SKF96365-induced inhibition was reduced in the presence of YTX, which suggest different pathways to act on [Ca(2+)]i. Preincubation with N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide.2HCl (H-89) or genistein (10 microM) also had no effect on the MTX-induced [Ca(2+)]i increment. In contrast, the PKC inhibitor bisindolilmaleimide I (GF109203X 1 microM) potentiated the MTX effect, whereas phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase inhibition with wortmannin (10 nM) reduced the MTX-elicited Ca(2+) entry. In summary, MTX produced Ca(2+) influx into human lymphocytes through a SKF96365-sensitive, nifedipine-insensitive pathway. The MTX-induced [Ca(2+)]i elevation was stimulated by the marine toxin YTX through a mechanism insensitive to SKF96365, nifedipine or NiCl(2). It was also stimulated by the divalent cation Ni(2+) and PKC inhibition and was partially inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibition.", 
    "149": "The dual aims of treating patients with chronic stable angina are 1) to reduce morbidity and mortality and 2) to eliminate angina with minimal adverse effects and allow the patient to return to normal activities. In the absence of contraindications, beta-blockers are recommended as initial therapy. All beta-blockers seem to be equally effective. If the patient has serious contraindications to beta-blockers, unacceptable side effects, or persistent angina, calcium antagonists should be administered. Long-acting dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine agents are generally as effective as beta-blockers in relieving angina. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line therapy because a nitrate-free interval is required to avoid developing tolerance. All long-acting nitrates seem to be equally effective. Patients with angina should take 75 to 325 mg of aspirin daily unless they have contraindications. Such risk factors as smoking, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, diabetes, and hypertension should be treated appropriately. Coronary revascularization has not been shown to improve survival for most patients with chronic angina but may be required to control symptoms. However, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often indicated for symptomatic patients with left-main disease, three-vessel disease, or two-vessel disease including proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery; it improves their survival. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is an alternative to CABG for patients with normal left ventricular function and favorable angiographic features. Coronary artery bypass grafting is initially more effective in relieving angina than medical therapy, but the two procedures yield similar results after 5 to 10 years. Eighty percent of patients who undergo CABG remain angina-free 5 years after surgery. In low-risk patients, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty seems to control angina better than medical therapy, but recurrent angina and repeated procedures are more likely than with CABG. Patient education is an important component of management. Long-term follow-up should be individualized to ascertain clinical stability at regular intervals and to reassess prognosis when warranted.", 
    "150": "The circadian variation in some biologic functions may have clinical, fiscal and therapeutic implications. The authors discuss circadian variation in portal pressure in cirrhotic patients and nocturnal occurrence of bleeding from varices in these patients. The pathogenesis of the diurnal variation in portal pressure is presented. The authors submit the hypothesis that an optimal dosing regimen for non-selective beta blocker therapy in the prevention of variceal bleed must include an evening dose of beta blocker medication. In studies reporting comparative efficacy of beta blocker therapy with other modalities in the prevention of variceal bleeding, the optimal dosing schedule for beta blocker therapy must be emphasized.",

We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms of the endothelin system might be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy-related cardiac phenotypes and differences in disease outcome.", 
    "152": "One hundred and twenty-five unrelated dilated cardiomyopathy patients of a well characterized dilated cardiomyopathy cohort were genotyped for six common polymorphisms of the endothelin-1, endothelin-A (ETA) and endothelin-B (ETB) receptor genes using hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides.", 
    "153": "The H323H (C/T) polymorphism in exon 6 of the ETA receptor gene was significantly associated with a shorter survival time after diagnosis. The odds ratio for carriers of the less frequent ET(A)T allele to die within 2 years after diagnosis was 5.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 21.0, P=0.013) compared to non-carriers. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly different survival time for T allele carriers as compared to non-carriers as tested by logrank (P=0.0196), Breslow (P=0.0195), and Tarone tests (P=0.020). The influence of the ETA H323H polymorphism on survival remained significant when known predictors of prognosis such as left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, age and NYHA functional classification were entered in a Cox proportional hazards analysis. In this model, end-diastolic diameter showed a trend to influence survival (P=0.07) but only the ETA H323H polymorphism (P=0.0029) was a significant independent predictor of survival.", 
    "154": "Our results suggest that genetic variation in the ETA receptor predicts survival in dilated cardiomyopathy patients, which might have important consequences for the identification of high-risk individuals.", 
    "155": "1. In mechanically dissociated rat spinal cord substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurones attached with native presynaptic nerve endings, glycinergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were recorded using nystatin perforated patch recording mode under voltage-clamp conditions. Under these conditions, it was tested whether the changes in P2X receptor subtype on the glycinergic presynaptic nerve terminals occur during postnatal development. 2. ATP facilitated glycinergic mIPSC frequency in a concentration-dependent manner through all developmental stages tested, whereas alphabeta-methylene-ATP (alphabeta-me-ATP) was only effective at later developmental stages. 3. alphabeta-me-ATP-elicited mIPSC frequency facilitation was completely occluded in the Ca2+-free external solution, but it was not affected by adding 10(-4) M Cd2+. 4. alphabeta-me-ATP still facilitated mIPSC frequency even in the presence of 10(-6) M thapsigargin, a Ca2+ pump blocker. 5. In later developmental stages, ATP-elicited presynaptic or postsynaptic responses were reversibly blocked by 10(-5) M pyridoxal-5-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (PPADS), but only partially blocked by 10(-7) M 2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP). However, alphabeta-me-ATP-elicited presynaptic or postsynaptic responses were completely and reversibly blocked by either 10(-5) M PPADS or 10(-7) M TNP-ATP. 6. alphabeta-me-ATP significantly reduced the evoked glycinergic IPSC amplitude in postnatal 28-30 day neurones, whereas it had no effect in 10-12 day neurones. 7. It was concluded that alphabeta-me-ATP-sensitive P2X receptors were functionally expressed on the glycinergic presynaptic nerve terminals projecting to SG neurones in later developmental stages. Such developmental changes of presynaptic P2X receptor subtypes might contribute to synaptic plasticity such as the regulation of neuronal excitability and the fine controlling of the pain signal in spinal dorsal horn neurones.", 
    "156": "The aim of this study was to explore the direct action of melatonin (Me) on basal and gonadotropin-stimulated progesterone (PG) and estradiol (E2) secretion of human granulosa cells (GCs) cultured in serum-free medium and in a superfused GC system. Human GCs were isolated from preovulatory follicular fluid aspirated from 34 women undergoing in vitro fertilization at the University Women's Hospital of T\u00fcbingen. PG and E2 production was measured in the presence and absence of Me, propranolol, LH or FSH using radioimmunoassay. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by ANOVA and Newman-Keuls test. Me stimulated E2 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Propranolol did not cause any change in E2 secretion, and when given with Me, it only partially blocked but could not entirely prevent E2 output. There was no statistically significant effect of Me on PG production when Me was administered at concentrations between 10(-4) and 10(-8) M. However, at 10(-3) M Me significantly suppressed PG output of granulosa cells. LH and FSH significantly stimulated the secretion of both steroid hormones. Me significantly reduced LH- and FSH-induced E2 secretion, as well as LH-stimulated PG output, while it caused only a slight, yet significant decrease in PG secretion. In the superfused GC system, FSH and LH resulted in a significant stimulatory effect on PG release. Me did not modify the stimulatory effect of FSH on PG, while it caused some delay in LH-stimulated PG release. Propranolol and Me had no stimulatory effect on PG release. On the basis of our results we suggest that Me has a direct modulatory effect on basal E2 and gonadotropin-stimulated E2 and PG secretion of human GCs. The observed effect may play a physiological role in the regulation of GC function during the menstrual cycle.", 
    "157": "We recently reported that angiotensin II (Ang II) induced IL-6 mRNA expression in cardiac fibroblasts, which played an important role in Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy in paracrine fashion. The present study investigated the regulatory mechanism of Ang II-induced IL-6 gene expression, focusing especially on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated signaling in cardiac fibroblasts. Ang II increased intracellular ROS in cardiac fibroblasts, and the increase was completely inhibited by the AT-1 blocker candesartan and the NADH/NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI). We first confirmed that antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, superoxide scavenger Tiron, and DPI suppressed Ang II-induced IL-6 expression. Because we observed that exogenous H(2)O(2) also increased IL-6 mRNA, the signaling pathways downstream of Ang II and exogenous H(2)O(2) were compared. Ang II, as well as exogenous H(2)O(2), activated ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK, which were significantly inhibited by N-acetylcysteine and DPI. In contrast with exogenous H(2)O(2), however, Ang II did not influence phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB-alpha/beta or nuclear translocation of p65, nor did it increase NF-kappaB promoter activity. PD98059 and SB203580 inhibited Ang II-induced IL-6 expression. Truncation and mutational analysis of the IL-6 gene promoter showed that CRE was an important cis-element in Ang II-induced IL-6 gene expression. NF-kappaB-binding site was important for the basal expression of IL-6, but was not activated by Ang II. Ang II phosphorylated CREB through the ERK and p38 MAPK pathway in a ROS-sensitive manner. Collectively, these data indicated that Ang II stimulated ROS production via the AT1 receptor and NADH/NADPH oxidase, and that these ROS mediated activation of MAPKs, which culminated in IL-6 gene expression through a CRE-dependent, but not NF-kappaB-dependent, pathway in cardiac fibroblasts.", 
    "158": "Hypercholesterolemia is a prominent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), yet cholesterol metabolism has not been evaluated in women with CAD. The objective of this study was to determine the interrelations of CAD, serum squalene and sterols, and cholesterol metabolism with each other in postmenopausal women. For this purpose, we measured serum squalene and sterols and fecal steroids (cholesterol and bile acids) and squalene by gas-liquid chromatography and evaluated cholesterol absorption and synthesis in postmenopausal women with CAD (n=29) and age-matched controls (n=20). On similar dietary lipid intake, the cholesterol absorption efficiency and mean serum cholesterol level were comparable, but the squalene-to-cholesterol ratio was higher in cases than in controls. The presence of CAD was inversely associated with fecal total steroids (logistic regression coefficient beta/SE=-2.11, P=0.04) and cholesterol synthesis (beta/SE=-2.14, P=0.04) and turnover (beta/SE=-2.19, P=0.03) after adjustment for dietary cholesterol, family history of CAD, smoking, low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum triglyceride levels. A high serum squalene ratio was not related to cholesterol synthesis but was inversely related to fecal squalene excretion, which was lower in cases than in controls. In conclusion, the presence of CAD in postmenopausal women is independently associated with altered cholesterol metabolism, as reflected by low synthesis and inefficient elimination of cholesterol."
