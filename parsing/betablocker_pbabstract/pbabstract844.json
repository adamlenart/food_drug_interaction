    "0": "The cause of alcoholic myocardiopathy is unknown. The effects of acute exposure to ethanol or its metabolite acetaldehyde on protein synthesis in working, intact, guinea pig hearts in vitro were studied utilizing lysine-(14)C perfusion. Ethanol at 250 mg/100 ml, a level sufficient to markedly inhibit hepatic production of albumin, did not alter cardiac function, the equilibration of the intracellular free lysine pool in either ventricle, or the incorporation of lysine-(14)C into protein. Thus, in controls and ethanol-perfused hearts, the incorporation of lysine in 3 hr was 44.1+/-1.5 and 42.8+/-1.2 mumoles lysine/g protein N for the right ventricles and 25.6+/-1.0 and 24.3+/-0.8 for the left ventricles, respectively. Only at lethal levels, 1500 mg/100 ml ethanol, was protein synthesis depressed. Acetaldehyde 3.5 mg/100 ml (0.8 mM) effected a markedly positive chronotropic and inotropic effect on the perfused heart and slightly depressed equilibration of the intracellular free lysine pool. However, determinations of protein incorporation of lysine-(14)C based on intracellular lysine-(14)C specific activities showed a significant decrease from control right and left ventricle values, to 27.1+/-2.8 and 14.9+/-1.9. Propanalol, which abolished the chronotropic effect, did not prevent the inhibition of protein synthesis. The studies suggest that acetaldehyde, which inhibits cardiac protein synthesis in vitro, may play a role in alcoholic myocardiopathy by interfering with normal myocardial protein synthesis.", 
    "1": "1. A method is described for the decerebration of dogs using high frequency coagulation. Animals made decerebrate by this method showed a slowing of the heart rate and a decrease in arterial pressure.2. Distension of the pulmonary vein-left atrial junctions by the inflation of small balloons caused an increase in heart rate in intact and decerebrate dogs. The magnitude of the response was not significantly different in the two states.3. The increase in heart rate caused by pulmonary vein distension was shown to be a reflex. It was significantly reduced by injection of propranolol both before and after decerebration. Cervical vagotomy always prevented any response.4. The similarity of the responses before and after decerebration suggests that structures rostral to the superior colliculus are not required for the appearance of the full reflex effect.5. The magnitude of the response remaining after administration of propranolol raised the question of the efficacy of propranolol as a beta-blocking agent in this experimental situation, or alternatively suggests the possibility of the existence of an efferent vagal component to the reflex response.", 
    "2": "The effects of intravenous and sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin), 40 mug/kg, were studied on coronary blood flow and resistance, left ventricular (LV) pressures (P) and diameters (D), rate of change of pressure (dP/dt), (dP/dt)/P, and on the velocity (V) of myocardial fiber shortening in conscious dogs. Nitroglycerin i.v. caused substantial coronary vasodilatation prior to any changes in systemic hemodynamics. Mean coronary flow increased by a maximum of 47 ml/min and coronary sinus P(o2) rose from 16 to 26 mm Hg while pressure and diameter began to fall, and heart rate began to rise. After the maximal fall in mean arterial pressure (-26 mm Hg), a secondary peak in coronary flow occurred which was associated with increases in heart rate (100 beats/min), (dP/dt)/P (22%), and isolength V (12%). Beta blockade prevented the reflex increases in contractility but only a part of the reflex tachycardia; the remainder was prevented by cholinergic blockade. Maintaining heart rate constant minimized the decreases in LV D and increases in contractility. When the reflex inotropic and chronotropic effects were prevented by a combination of atrial pacing and beta blockade the early coronary vasodilatation was unaltered, but the later coronary vasodilatation was minimized. Thus i.v. nitroglycerin in the conscious dog exerts a potent direct coronary vasodilating action and also a secondary coronary vasodilation caused by reflex increases in contractility and heart rate. The decreases in diameter are largely the result of tachycardia. Sublingual nitroglycerin produced directionally similar, but quantitatively lesser effects on coronary flow and resistance, LV D, LV P, and contractility.", 
    "3": "1. The vasoactivity of a number of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the auto-perfused splanchnic region and hindquarters of the cat have been investigated.2. Theophylline, dipyridamole and 4-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 7-2956) and its analogues were more potent vasodilators in the splanchnic region than in the hindquarters, whereas papaverine was a potent vasodilator in both these vascular beds.3. The vasodilator response to the phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the splanchnic region and hindquarters was not susceptible to beta-adrenoceptor blockade.4. Infusion of dibutyryl cyclic AMP into the superior mesenteric artery increased vascular conductance of the splanchnic region. This effect was enhanced by Ro 20-1724 in doses below those in which this compound affected conductance.5. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that accumulation of cyclic AMP in vascular smooth muscle mediates the vasodilator response to phosphodiesterase inhibitors.", 
    "4": "Experiments were carried out in pregnant nephrectomized rabbits to determine the relationship between uterine blood flow and uterine renin secretion. Uterine blood flow was measured by the percentage distribution of radioactive microspheres injected into the left ventricle which lodged in uterus and placenta, and cardiac output was measured by dye dilution. In 40 animals, 24 hr after nephrectomy, uterine blood flow was 4.7+/-0.4% of cardiac output and absolute flow 32.4+/-3 ml/100 g per min. Plasma renin activity (PRA) in uterine vein, 994+/-182 ng/100 ml per hr, was higher than in carotid artery, 832+/-143 (P < 0.025). With reduction of uterine blood flow from 4.7+/-0.5 to 1.95+/-0.3% of cardiac output and absolute flow from 30.8+/-4.6 to 8.8+/-2 ml/100 g per min, uterine vein PRA rose from 1434+/-234 to 4430+/-300 (P < 0.001), and carotid artery PRA from 1009+/-200 to 2300+/-350 (P < 0.01). Hemorrhagic hypotension caused uterine vein PRA to increase from 913+/-293 to 3638+/-1276 (P < 0.001) and carotid artery PRA from 774+/-252 to 1730+/-433 (P < 0.01). Uterine blood flow expressed as a percentage of cardiac output remained constant after hemorrhage, 5.5+/-0.9 and 6.3+/-0.8%, although absolute flow fell from 37+/-7.7 to 29+/-3.6 ml/100 g per min because of the large fall in cardiac output which occurred.Angiotensin, 10 ng/kg per min, caused no significant change in blood pressure or cardiac output but increased uterine blood flow from 4.1+/-0.6 to 8.4+/-1% (P < 0.005) of cardiac output with absolute flow increasing from 37.4+/-7 to 73.2+/-10 ml/100 g per min (P < 0.001). The increase in uterine blood flow during angiotensin was abolished by the prior administration of propranolol. Isoproterenol, 0.5 mu/min, increased uterine blood flow from 3.5+/-0.6 to 6.4+/-1.2% of cardiac output (P < 0.02) with absolute flow increasing from 25+/-5 to 51+/-12 ml/100 g per min (P < 0.05). Norepinephrine, 500 ng/min, caused no significant change in uterine blood flow. These findings suggest that uterine renin might be involved in regulating uterine blood flow, secretion being increased in response to a reduction in flow with the resultant rise in circulating or local angiotensin, through beta adrenergic stimulation, increasing uterine blood flow.", 
    "5": "1. Propranolol, as the racemate and the (+)- and (-)-isomers (400 mug/l.) and practolol (50 mg/l.) were tested for their effects on atrial and ventricular rates and on the duration of overdrive suppression (ODI) in isolated perfused cat hearts with surgically-induced heart block.2. Racemic propranolol and the (+)- and (-)-isomers prolonged ODI and slowed the rate of the ventricular pacemaker; the (+)- and (-)-isomers also reduced the rate of the atrial pacemaker. Practolol shortened ODI and increased the rate of the atrial and ventricular pacemakers.3. The (+)- and (-)-isomers were more potent than the racemate; the (-)-isomer was more potent than the (+)-isomer. The results suggest there is a stereospecific mechanism involved in the biological distribution of propranolol.4. Twenty-four hours after reserpine treatment (5 mg/kg, i.p.) practolol continued to increase the rate of the atrial and ventricular pacemakers but did not shorten ODI.5. The mechanism by which these agents affect myocardial excitability and automaticity is discussed."
