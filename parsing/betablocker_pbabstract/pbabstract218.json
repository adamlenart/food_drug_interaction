In organ bath system, isometric force of the circular smooth muscle of guinea-pig gastric antrum was measured. Electrical activity of the muscle was recorded by using intracellular microelectrode. Electrical and mechanical activities were recorded by chart recorder. ATP and 2-MeSATP potentiated the mechanical activity but did not affect electrical activity in gastric circular smooth muscle. ATP and 2-MeSATP-induced contraction was effectively blocked by nonselective P2y-purinoceptor antagonist, reactive-blue-2 and suramin, but ATP-induced contraction was not blocked by alpha,beta-MeATP-induced desensitization of P2x-purinoceptors. However, alpha,beta-MeATP, P2x-purinoceptor agonist, attenuated slow waves with membrane hyperpolarization and inhibited contraction. The relaxation by beta,gamma-MeATP was blocked by alpha,beta-MeATP-induced desensitization of P2x-purinoceptors. ATP-induced contraction was blocked by external calcium-free, but not by nicardipine, a L-type calcium channel blocker. Indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, did not block ATP-induced contraction. The results suggest that: (1) ATP- and analogues-induced contraction is mediated by P2y-purinoceptor, whereas alpha,beta-MeATP-induced relaxation by P2x-purinoceptor in guinea-pig gastric antral circular smooth muscle. (2) ATP-induced contraction is dependent on extracellular calcium, but Ca2+ entry is not mediated by L-type calcium channel. (3) Prostaglandins are not involved in ATP- and analogue-induced contraction of gastric circular smooth muscle in guinea-pigs, and alpha,beta-MeATP-induced relaxation is related to membrane hyperpolarization.",

    "2": "Patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension and LV hypertrophy were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan (n = 48) or the beta1 adrenoreceptor blocker atenolol (n = 49). A microarray-based minisequencing system was used for genotyping 74 SNPs in 25 genes. These genotypes were related to the change in LV mass index by echocardiography, after 12 weeks treatment as monotherapy, using stepwise multiple regression analysis.", 
    "3": "The blood pressure reductions were similar and significant in both treatment groups. Two SNPs in two separate genes (the angiotensinogen T1198C polymorphism, corresponding to the M235T variant and the apolipoprotein B G10108A polymorphism) for those treated with irbesartan, and the adrenoreceptor alpha2A A1817G for those treated with atenolol, significantly predicted the change in LV mass. The predictive power of these SNPs was independent of the degree of blood pressure reduction.", 
    "4": "SNPs in the angiotensinogen, apolipoprotein B, and the alpha2 adrenoreceptor gene predicted the change in LV mass during antihypertensive therapy. These results illustrate the potential of using microarray-based technology for SNP genotyping in predicting individual drug responses.", 
    "5": "The review presents our results on the regulatory role of prostaglandins (PG) and nitric oxide (NO) in the activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by cholinergic, adrenergic and histaminergic systems and by neurohormones: corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) under basal conditions. The synthesis of endogenous PG or NO was inhibited by non-selective and selective cyclooxygenase (COX) antagonists and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) blockers given 15 min before the respective receptor agonist and HPA axis activity was assessed 1 h later by measuring plasma ACTH and serum corticosterone levels. The muscarinic agent - carbachol-induced HPA response was considerably supressed by piroxicam, a predominantly constitutive cyclooxygenase (COX-1) inhibitor and significantly diminished by indomethacin, a non-selective COX blocker, but was unaffected by compound NS-398, an inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2) antagonist. A non-selective NOS antagonist L-NAME and neuronal NOS blocker L-NNA significantly intensified the carbachol-induced corticosterone secretion. The nicotine-induced increase in ACTH and corticosterone response was significantly supressed by piroxicam, and diminished by indomethacin, but was significantly augmented by L-NAME and L-NNA. The inhibition of PG synthesis by indomethacin totally abolished or reversed the increase of nicotine-induced hormone responses to both NOS blockers. The i.c.v. phenylephrine, an alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist - evoked HPA response was significantly impaired by piroxicam and compound NS-398 and more potently reduced by L-NAME. The i.c.v. clonidine, an alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist - elicited HPA response was also considerably decreased by piroxicam, compound NS-398 and L-NAME. By contrast, the stimulatory effect of i.c.v. isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist, was not altered by either COX or NOS inhibitors. The i.c.v. histamine- and HTMT, a histamine H(1)-agonist-induced ACTH and corticosterone response were significantly diminished by piroxicam and indomethacin, respectively. Compound NS-398, did not markedly alter the HPA response to HTMT or amthamine, a histamine H(2) receptor agonist. Inhibition of endogenous NO synthesis by a neuronal NOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole markedly enhanced the histamine-induced hormone secretion, abolished the HTMT-induced response and did not substantially alter the amthamine-evoked ACTH and corticosterone secretion. COX blockers did not significantly affect the CRH-induced HPA response and the inhibition of NO synthesis by L-NNA markedly intensified ACTH response. The vasopressin-stimulated increase in HPA response, was considerably reduced by the inhibition of PG synthesis by both COX antagonists while inhibition of NO synthesis by NOS blockers greatly enhanced this response. The involvement of PG and NO in the neurohormonal regulation of HPA activity depends mainly on greatly complex and tightly regulated mechanisms at the level of second messengers IP(3) and adenylyl cyclase systems.",

    "7": "A systematic and comprehensive search of the literature was performed to identify controlled clinical trials of magnesium sulphate in paediatric acute asthma which evaluated outcomes of hospitalisation or short term pulmonary function tests or symptom scores. Unpublished data were searched by personal contacts with authors and specialists. Two reviewers independently assessed trial qualities and synthesised data. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated by the Cochrane Q test. Outcome data were pooled by random or fixed effect models depending on presence or absence of heterogeneity.", 
    "8": "Five randomised placebo controlled trials involving a total of 182 patients were identified. They compared intravenous magnesium sulphate to placebo in treating paediatric patients with moderate to severe asthmatic attacks in the emergency department, with co-therapies of inhaled beta2 agonists and systemic steroids. The studies were of high quality with results judged to be valid. Four studies showed that magnesium sulphate was effective, while one study found it ineffective. There was no significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome of hospitalisation. In the fixed effect model, magnesium sulphate is effective in preventing hospitalisation (OR 0.290, 95% CI 0.143 to 0.589). The number needed to treat is 4 (95% CI 3 to 8). Secondary outcomes of short term pulmonary function tests and clinical symptom scores also showed significant improvement.",

    "11": "ES cells were treated with nicotine (1-1000 nM) and/or 10 microM tubocurarine (a usual nicotinic acetylcholine receptors [nAChRs] blocker) for 24 h. Subsequently, they were purified to discard feeder cells and total RNA was isolated. Fgf-5 was amplified to detect the purification of ES cells, and the relative expression of Oct-4 and beta-actin to GAPDH was analyzed with RT-PCR.", 
    "12": "RT-PCR analysis illustrated that nicotine (10-1000 nM) significantly enhanced Oct-4 transcription, while had no effect on beta-actin transcription; meanwhile, compared with nicotine (100 nM and 1000 nM) treatment alone, tubocurarine inhibited Oct-4 transcription evidently.", 
    "13": "It is reasonable to assume that nicotine could influence the development and differentiation of ES cells, and impinge on the early embryo development.", 
    "14": "The aim of this experimental study was to investigate whether nebivolol has protective effects against neuronal damage induced by spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Twenty-one rabbits were divided into three groups: group I (control, no I/R), group II (only I/R) and group III (I/R+nebivolol). Spinal cord ischemia was induced by clamping the aorta both below the left renal artery and above the aortic bifurcation. Seventy-two hours postoperatively, the motor function of the lower limbs was evaluated in each animal. The animals were sacrificed at 72 h, and histopathological and biochemical analyses were carried out in the lumbar spinal cords. The motor deficit scores in nebivolol group were different from I/R group at 72 h (3.25+/-0.70 vs. 1.75+/-1.28, p=0.01). I/R produced a significant increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD), xanthine oxidase (XO), adenosine deaminase (ADA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities in spinal cord tissue when compared with control group. Nebivolol treatment prevented the increase of all those enzymes activities produced by I/R. A significant decrease in spinal cord glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) level was seen in I/R group and nebivolol treatment prevented the decrement in the spinal cord tissue GSH-Px contents. On the other hand, I/R produced a significant increase in the spinal cord tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) contents, this was prevented by nebivolol treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a considerable neuroprotective effect of nebivolol on neurological, biochemical and histopathological status during periods of spinal cord I/R in rabbits.", 
    "15": "Syncope is a common symptom that has different recurrence ratios. We hypothesized that an individualized treatment regimen including pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures considering kind of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS) and basal characteristics of each patient could allow optimized therapy to avoid recurrences.", 
    "16": "We conducted a prospective study to evaluate performance of diverse accepted treatments for NCS. Each patient received specific treatment including general measures such as an increase in salt and water intake, tilt training, specific pharmacologic treatment according to head-up tilt table test (HUTT) result, and patient basal blood pressure and heart rate measurements.", 
    "17": "We followed a group of 127 patients during a main period of 20.8 +/- 9 months (range, 6-38 months). Mean age was 47.8 +/- 19.2 years and 66.9% were females. We had six (4.7%) patients with recurrence of symptoms 4 +/- 0.9 months after diagnostic HUTT. Medications used were atenolol in 20 patients, pindolol in 17, dysopiramide in 50, and fluoxetine in 25. Two patients received fludrocortisone. Tilt training was not indicated initially for patients with recurrences but was indicated later; to date, these patients have not experienced further episodes.",

In this report, we describe 5 cases of severe chronic heart failure due to ACM effectively treated with the beta-blocker, carvedilol. Their left ventricular function as well as cardiac symptoms were persistently improved after treatment with carvedilol, suggesting that carvedilol may be an effective therapeutic strategy for ACM as demonstrated in other forms of chronic heart failure.", 
    "20": "A 54-year-old man with severe left ventricular dysfunction due to dilated cardiomyopathy was referred to our hospital for symptomatic incessant sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). After the administration of nifekalant hydrochloride, sustained VT was terminated. An alternate class III agent, sotalol, was also effective for the prevention of VT. However, one month after switching over nifekalant to sotalol, a short duration of ST elevation was documented in ECG monitoring at almost the same time for three consecutive days. ST elevation with chest discomfort disappeared since he began taking long-acting diltiazem. Coronary vasospasm may be induced by the non-selective beta-blocking properties of sotalol.",

In a previous study, we found that TGF-beta and its receptors were expressed in gastric mucosa of patients with well-healed gastric ulcers, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. To further characterize the role of TGF-beta and its receptors in repairing gastric ulcers, we investigated the expression patterns of TGF-beta and its receptors in gastric mucosa by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).", 
    "22": "Seventy-four patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcers were eligible for participation in this study. All patients had routine biopsies on initial endoscopy and were then treated for 12 wk with an H2 blocker. Repeat endoscopy was then performed. There were 8 patients with poorly healed ulcers, and biopsies were taken from the margin of the residual ulcers. These tissue samples, along with biopsy of gastric mucosa near the original ulcers from 8 randomly selected patients with well-healed ulcers were examined for TGF-beta and TGF-beta receptor II mRNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, as well as immunohistochemistry.", 
    "23": "TGF-beta and TGF-beta receptor II were strongly expressed in tissues from patients with well-healed ulcers. Four of the 8 patients with poor healing had low or absent expression of TGF-beta or TGF-beta receptor II mRNA.

    "25": "We recently demonstrated that both lisinopril and candesartan, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, respectively, attenuate pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis in male Wistar Bonn/Kobori (WBN/Kob) rats. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether combination therapy with low doses of both, ineffective when given alone, might synergistically exert protective effects. Lisinopril, candesartan, or a combination of both in drinking water was administered to 10-week-old male WBN/Kob rats for 10 weeks. Parameters of inflammation and fibrosis, positive immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin, and gene expression of cytokine and growth factors were assessed, as well as circulating renin-angiotensin system components. Dose-dependent effects of combination therapy were also investigated. Only combination therapy attenuated gross alterations in the pancreas, as quantitatively confirmed by increases in pancreatic weights and decreases in myeloperoxidase activity, hydroxyproline content, histologic scores, relative fibrosis area, and relative area of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells. Combination therapy suppressed up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor-receptor beta, and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA in the pancreas. Dose dependence of combination therapy was recognized with reference to improvement in these parameters. The conclusions are that combination therapy synergistically alleviated pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis in male WBN/Kob rats. This effect may be related to suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor-receptor beta, and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA. Compared with the either therapy alone, combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker may be more beneficial for treating chronic pancreatitis.", 
    "26": "The Heart Failure Survival Score (HFSS) has been previously shown to effectively risk-stratify patients under evaluation for heart transplantation. However, this model was developed before broad use of beta blockade. We hypothesized that the prognostic tool would retain its ability to risk stratify patients treated with beta-blockers.", 
    "27": "We collected clinical data on 524 consecutive patients referred for heart transplantation from 1994 to 2001. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariable Cox regression analysis were performed with events defined as death, left ventricular assist device placement, or United Network of Organ Sharing 1 heart transplantation.", 
    "28": "Kaplan-Meier analysis of the patient population revealed effective discrimination by the survival score both for beta-blocker treated and untreated patients (both p <0.0001). Two-year event-free survival was 94% +/- 2% and 84% +/- 4% for beta-blocker and no beta-blocker patients in the low-risk HFSS strata. Cox proportional hazard modeling showed that HFSS strata (medium risk: HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.75-4.02, p <0.001; high risk: HR 5.51, 95% CI 3.64-8.33, p <0.001) and beta-blocker treatment (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31-0.64, p <0.001) were significant predictors of event-free survival. Receiver operating curves (area under the curve) for HFSS strata used to predict 2-year events were similar for beta-blocker treated (0.78 +/- 0.04) and untreated (0.80 +/- 0.03) patients.", 
    "29": "The HFSS provides effective risk stratification with or without beta-blocker therapy. Consideration of beta-blocker therapy with survival score strata improves outcome prediction in patients evaluated for heart transplantation.", 
    "30": "Essential hypertension is characterized by increased peripheral vascular resistance to blood flow. This resistance results mostly from energy dissipation in small arteries and arterioles. Small decreases in the lumen of these arteries significantly increase resistance. Resistance arteries may play an important role in the development, and may contribute to the complications, of hypertension. Recent studies have demonstrated that the media-lumen ratio of small arteries has prognostic significance in relation to cardiovascular events in hypertensive subjects. Almost all hypertensive patients have vascular-structure remodeling; however, only some exhibit endothelial dysfunction. In particular, endothelial dysfunction is less common in mild hypertension. In both experimental models and humans with hypertension, antihypertensive treatment may partially correct the remodeling of small arteries and arterioles. Some antihypertensive drugs can correct small artery structure and impaired endothelial function. Because the degree of remodeling predicts events in hypertensive subjects, and endothelial dysfunction results from the oxidative stress that may also predict events, correction of small artery structure and function may favorably affect outcomes in hypertension. This improvement in morbidity and mortality end points could be a long-term effect, however, making it difficult to prove in trials lasting 3 to 5 years. Nevertheless, many patients with hypertension will be treated for decades; therefore, the potential long-term benefits of vascular protection might be quite important.",

    "32": "Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats fed a high-salt diet from 7 weeks of age were randomized to groups that were either not treated (DHF; n = 20) or treated with metoprolol (MP) from 7 weeks of age (DHF+7wkMP; n = 22) or from 17 weeks of age (DHF+17wkMP; n = 8). Both LV function and remodeling were evaluated by serial echocardiography, followed by hemodynamic and pathologic studies.", 
    "33": "Hypertension and pressure-overload LV hypertrophy were established by 17 weeks of age in DHF rats. At about 20 weeks of age DHF rats experienced overt heart failure, which was accompanied not by a decrease in LV fractional shortening but by diastolic filling abnormalities. The LV concentric hypertrophy was strikingly attenuated in DHF+7wkMP rats but not in DHF+17wkMP rats. However, LV myocardial fibrosis and the further progression of diastolic dysfunction were prevented in both MP-treated groups. Survival at 21 weeks of age was significantly improved in DHF+7wkMP (86%) and DHF+17wkMP (75%) rats compared with DHF rats (25%).", 
    "34": "In this study, MP prevented not only the development of LV hypertrophy but also the progression of diastolic dysfunction, and improved survival in rats with DHF. The preventive effect of MP on myocardial fibrosis is suggested as one of the mechanisms contributing to halt the progression of diastolic dysfunction, a finding that may lead to clinical benefits in regard to DHF caused by hypertension.", 
    "35": "Studies describe differences between recommendations for hypertension treatment and actual drug use. Antihypertensive use data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for 1995 to 1999 showed a downward trend for calcium antagonist (CA) use and increased use of beta-blockers (BB) and thiazide diuretics (TD). This study evaluates national VA antihypertensive treatment for 2000 to 2002 and compares these data to treatment data for 1995 to 1999.", 
    "36": "National VA pharmacy data were used to determine use of BB, TD, CA, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and combinations of antihypertensive drugs for 2000 to 2002. Dispensing data were converted to treatment days. In addition to national trends, data were analyzed regionally to examine geographic differences. Pharmacoeconomic analysis estimated the financial impact of medication changes.", 
    "37": "Antihypertensive drug use in the VA represented more than 1 billion days in 2002. The ACEI were most commonly used, representing 33.4% and 33.5% of treatment days in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Changes from 2000 to 2002 were 21.9% to 24.2% for BB, 29.3% to 24.4% for CA, and 13.2% to 14.2% for TD. Use of ARB increased from 2.1% to 3.7% of treatment days. Analysis of the 21 VA regions showed geographic variation. For example, the proportion of BB treatment days is highest in a northeast VA region (28.6%) and lowest in a southeast region (19.9%). In 2002 the VA has saved an estimated US 8.5 million dollars because of changes in medication use.",

    "39": "Treatment with non-selective beta-blockers has been proposed to have an indirect antiviral activity acting via an enhanced performance of the immune system, and the mechanism of this activity has been laid out earlier. Experimental and clinical findings are presented that corroborate the hypothesis that inhibiting the immunosuppressive and stress-related cAMP-PKA pathway will enhance the immune system's ability to recognize foreign antigen and to access its vast repertory in an improved way, resulting in an indirect antiviral activity. Other drugs having an inhibitory effect on the cAMP-PKA pathway in cells of the immune system and therefore expected to have a comparable activity spectrum with different specific side-effects are presented, for example aspirin. Additionally the so far unexplained anticancer activity of aspirin is related to the same mechanism of an enhanced performance of the immune system.", 
    "40": "The kinetics and mechanistic aspects of the riboflavin-photosensitised oxidation of the topically administrable ophthalmic drugs Timolol (Tim) and Pindolol (Pin) were investigated in water-MeOH (9:1, v/v) solution employing light of wavelength > 400 nm. riboflavin, belonging to the vitamin B(2) complex, is a known human endogenous photosensitiser. The irradiation of riboflavin in the presence of ophthalmic drugs triggers a complex picture of competitive reactions which produces the photodegradation of both the drugs and the pigment itself. The mechanism was elucidated employing stationary photolysis, polarographic detection of dissolved oxygen, stationary and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, and laser flash photolysis. Ophthalmic drugs quench riboflavin-excited singlet and triplet states. From the quenching of excited triplet riboflavin, the semireduced form of the pigment is generated, through an electron transfer process from the drug, with the subsequent production of superoxide anion radical (O(2)(*-)) by reaction with dissolved molecular oxygen. Through the interaction of dissolved oxygen with excited triplet riboflavin, the species singlet oxygen (O(2)((1)Delta(g))) is also generated to a lesser extent. Both O(2)(*-) and O(2)((1)Delta(g)) induce photodegradation of ophthalmic drugs, Tim being approximately 3-fold more easily photooxidisable than Pin, as estimated by oxygen consumption experiments.", 
    "41": "There are lines of evidence that natural killer (NK) cells are sensitive to physical and psychological stress. Alterations in the immune system including NK cells are known to differ among tissues and organs. The effect of stress on the lung immune system, however, has not been well documented in spite of the fact that the lungs always confront viral or bacterial attacks as well as tumour cell metastasis. In this study, we intended to investigate the effect of restraint stress on lung lymphocytes including NK cells. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 2 h restraint stress. The concentration of plasma epinephrine significantly rose immediately after the release from restraint as compared to home-cage control mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the numbers of most lymphocyte subsets including NK cells were decreased in the lungs and blood but not in the spleen, immediately after restraint stress. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the number of NK cells was decreased in the intraparenchymal region of the lungs, while the number of alveolar macrophages did not change. The decrease in the number of NK cells in the lungs and blood was reversed by the administration of propranolol, a nonselective beta adrenergic antagonist. Taken together, our findings suggest that acute stress reduces the number of intraparenchymal lung NK cells via activation of beta adrenergic receptors.",

    "43": "Thirty patients with POAG were randomized in an open-label, cross-over study. Intraocular pressure reduction was achieved by 4 weeks medical therapy with D/T twice daily or latanoprost 0.005% dosed once in the evening. During a 4-week run-in and a 4-week wash-out period between study arms, patients ceased use of all other glaucoma medications and used timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily. Primary efficacy variables were IOP and POBF.", 
    "44": "There was no difference in baseline IOP and POBF parameters between the two study arms. Both D/T and latanoprost statistically significantly reduced IOP by 4.6 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and 3.75 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and increased POBF by 2.048 microl/second (p = 0.0030) and 2.147 microl/second (p = 0.0009), respectively. Repeated measures anova detected significant changes in POBF with treatment (p = 0.0361). Dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination statistically significantly increased pulse volume by 0.767 microl (p = 0.0087), while latanoprost therapy had no significant effect (p = 0.2407).", 
    "45": "Both drugs had similar effects in terms of IOP reduction. Dorzolamide/timolol significantly increased pulse volume while latanoprost had no effect. Further studies are necessary to establish whether the enhancement of choroidal blood flow can prevent glaucoma progression.", 
    "46": "Optimal outpatient treatment of systolic heart failure has three goals that should be pursued simultaneously: (1) control of risk factors for the development and progression of heart failure, (2) treatment of heart failure, and (3) education of patients. Control of risk factors includes treating hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, and eliminating the use of alcohol and tobacco. All patients with heart failure should be taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker. In the absence of contraindications, an ACE inhibitor is preferred. In most patients, physicians should consider adding a beta blocker to ACE-inhibitor therapy. In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone is a useful addition to baseline drug therapy, as is carvedilol (substitute carvedilol if patient is already taking a beta blocker). Patients with stable heart failure should be encouraged to begin and maintain a regular aerobic exercise program. Digoxin therapy may reduce the likelihood of hospitalization but does not reduce mortality. It must be monitored closely, with a target dosage level of 0.5 to 1.1 ng per mL. Symptoms may be controlled with the use of diuretics and restricted dietary sodium. Finally, patient education, with the patient's active participation in the care, is a key strategy in the management of heart failure. Periodic follow-up between scheduled office visits, which is essential in the long-term management of heart failure, may include telephone calls from the office nurse, maintenance of a daily symptom and weight diary, and participation in a disease-management program.", 
    "47": "The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of latanoprost 0.005% and timolol maleate 0.5% in black and white patients with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). This double-masked, randomized, 2-period crossover study included 39 eyes in 22 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After a 2- to 4-week washout period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either vehicle placebo in the morning and latanoprost in the evening or timolol maleate twice daily for 6 weeks. Then, after a 4-week washout period, patients received the opposing treatment for 6 weeks. Both latanoprost and timolol maleate significantly lowered IOP from baseline in both black and white patients. Latanoprost treatment was associated with lower mean IOP compared with timolol treatment in black patients (P = .013 at 8 AM, P = .19 at 10 AM). At 10 AM at the end of the treatment period, the mean +/- SD change from baseline IOP in black patients receiving latanoprost was significantly greater than that of white patients (-10.2 +/- 7.0 and -5.9 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, respectively; P = .042). The mean +/- SD change from baseline IOPs in black patients was not significantly different from that in white patients at 8 AM at the end of the treatment period for the latanoprost group and at 8 AM and 10 AM at the end of the treatment period for the timolol maleate group. In white patients, the change from baseline IOP in light (grade 1) irises was not significantly different from dark (grade 5) irises after treatment with either latanoprost or timolol maleate. In summary, intraocular pressure after treatment with latanoprost was lower than that after timolol treatment in black patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension, and at 1 of 2 timepoints, latanoprost caused a significantly greater reduction of IOP in black patients than in white patients.", 
    "48": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate three process parameters for the application of ethylcellulose films from organic solutions to obtain multi-particulate controlled drug delivery of propranolol hydrochloride. The coating process was developed in a classical coating pan. A Box-Behnken central composite design was used to evaluate the effect of the film thickness (expressed as the amount of lacquer applied on pellets' surface unit), concentration of lacquer in the coating dispersion, and the plasticizer concentration on the independent variables. Those were t85, the degree of sticking in the coating pan, and the duration of the coating process. Contour and response surface plots were depicted based on the equation given by the model. Because the results were competitive, i.e., improving one response had an opposite effect on another one, an overall desirability function was described to ameliorate the interpretation of the results. The optimization procedure generated the maximum overall desirability value. A formulation was prepared under the optimized conditions yielding response values which were close to the predicted values. To understand the mechanism of drug release from the optimized pellets various models were used to fit the dissolution data. The Higuchi model appears to provide the best correlation.",

Applying the patch-clamp technique to vacuoles from sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) taproots we studied the effect of divalent cations on the vacuolar side of the SV channel. Our results show that the SV channel has two independent binding sites for vacuolar divalent cations, (i) a less selective one, inside the channel pore, binding to which impedes channel conductance, and (ii) a Ca(2+)-selective one outside the membrane-spanning part of the channel protein, binding to which stabilizes the channel's closed conformations. Vacuolar Ca2+ and Mg2+ almost indiscriminately blocked ion fluxes through the open channel pore, decreasing measured single-channel current amplitudes. This low-affinity block displays marked voltage dependence, characteristic of a 'permeable blocker'. Vacuolar Ca(2+)-with a much higher affinity than Mg(2+)-slows down SV channel activation and shifts the voltage dependence to more (cytosol) positive potentials. A quantitative analysis results in a model that exactly describes the Ca(2+)-specific effects on the SV channel activation kinetics and voltage gating. According to this model, multiple (approximately three) divalent cations bind with a high affinity at the luminal interface of the membrane to the channel protein, favoring the occupancy of one of the SV channel's closed states (C2). Transition to another closed state (C1) diminishes the effective number of bound cations, probably due to mutual repulsion, and channel opening is accompanied by a decrease of binding affinity. Hence, the open state (O) is destabilized with respect to the two closed states, C1 and C2, in the presence of Ca2+ at the vacuolar side. The specificity for Ca2+ compared to Mg2+ is explained in terms of different binding affinities for these cations. In this study we demonstrate that vacuolar Ca2+ is a crucial regulator to restrict SV channel activity to a physiologically meaningful range, which is less than 0.1% of maximum SV channel activity.",

    "51": "Red blood cells may regulate tissue circulation and O2 delivery by releasing the vasodilator ATP in response to hypoxia. When released extracellularly, ATP is rapidly degraded to ADP in the circulation by ectonucleotidases. In this study, we show that ADP acting on P2Y13 receptors on red blood cells serves as a negative feedback pathway for the inhibition of ATP release. mRNA of the ADP receptor P2Y13 was highly expressed in human red blood cells and reticulocytes. The stable ADP analogue 2-MeSADP decreased ATP release from red blood cells by inhibition of cAMP. The P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptor antagonist AR-C67085 (30 micromol/L), but not the P2Y1 blocker MRS2179, inhibited the effects of 2-MeSADP. At doses where AR-C67085 only blocks P2Y12 (100 nmol/L), it had no effect. AR-C67085 and the nucleotidase apyrase increased cAMP per se, indicating a constant cAMP inhibitory effect of endogenous extracellular ADP. 2-MeSADP reduced plasma ATP concentrations in an in vivo pig model. Our results indicate that the ATP degradation product ADP inhibits ATP release by acting on the red blood cell P2Y13 receptor. This negative feedback system could be important in the control of plasma ATP levels and tissue circulation.", 
    "52": "A possible involvement of endocannabinoids in a chronic model of endotoxemia was assessed by measuring the regional (renal, mesenteric, hindquarters) hemodynamic responses to continuous 24-h LPS infusion (150 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) in conscious, male Sprague-Dawley rats, in the absence or presence of the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist AM-251 (3 mg/kg). AM-251 inhibited the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS, but did not influence the other hemodynamic changes. In subsequent experiments, it was shown that the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS were also inhibited by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. In addition, the late (at 24 h) hindquarters vasodilator effects of LPS were inhibited by the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118551. Against the background of our previous work showing beta-adrenoceptor involvement in the cardiovascular effects of exogenous cannabinoids, we conclude that AM-251 may have been inhibiting endocannabinoid-modulated, sympathoadrenal-mediated activation of vasodilator beta-adrenoceptors in LPS-infused rats rather than suppressing a direct vasodilator action of endocannabinoids.",

Exposure of MDA-MB-453 cells for 6 days to the beta-blocker propranolol (1 microM) increased the GIRK1 mRNA levels and decreased beta2-adrenergic mRNA levels, while treatment for 30 minutes daily for 7 days had no effect. Exposure to a beta-adrenergic agonist and antagonist for 24 hours had no effect on gene expression. The beta adrenergic agonist, formoterol hemifumarate, led to increases in K+ flux into MDA-MB-453 cells, and this increase was inhibited by the GIRK channel inhibitor clozapine.

Beta-blocker potential side effects as bradycardia, hypotension and especially acute decompensation could explain this under prescription. Clinical data could easily identify high-risk patients for hypotension or bradycardia but not high-risk patients for induced decompensation linked to beta-blocker therapy. BNP could identify these patients with a high sensitivity. Patients with BNP above 1000 pg/ml had a 40% risk of acute decompensation after introduction or increase of beta-blocker therapy. As a conclusion, clinicians must be very cautious for introducing or increasing Carvedilol therapy in patients with high BNP levels.", 
    "59": "The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and its adrenergic input are key components in stress-induced reinstatement and maintenance of drug use. Intra-BNST injections of either beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) antagonists or alpha2-adrenergic receptor (alpha2-AR) agonists can inhibit footshock-induced reinstatement and maintenance of cocaine- and morphine-seeking. Using electrophysiological recording methods in an in vitro slice preparation from C57/Bl6j adult male mouse BNST, we have examined the effects of adrenergic receptor activation on excitatory synaptic transmission in the lateral dorsal supracommissural BNST (dBNST) and subcommissural BNST (vBNST). Alpha2-AR activation via UK-14,304 (10 microM) results in a decrease in excitatory transmission in both dBNST and vBNST, an effect predominantly dependent upon the alpha2A-AR subtype. Beta-AR activation via isoproterenol (1 microM) results in an increase in excitatory transmission in dBNST, but not in vBNST. Consistent with the work with receptor subtype specific agonists, application of the endogenous ligand norepinephrine (NE, 100 microM) elicits two distinct effects on glutamatergic transmission. In dBNST, NE elicits an increase in transmission (62% of dBNST NE experiments) or a decrease in transmission (38% of dBNST NE experiments). In vBNST, NE elicits a decrease in transmission in 100% of the experiments. In dBNST, the NE-induced increase in synaptic transmission is blocked by beta1/beta2- and beta2-, but not beta1-specific antagonists. In addition, this increase is also reduced by the alpha2-AR antagonist yohimbine and is absent in the alpha2A-AR knockout mouse. In vBNST, the NE-induced decrease in synaptic transmission is markedly reduced in the alpha2A-AR knockout mouse. Further experiments demonstrate that the actions of NE on glutamatergic transmission can be correlated with beta-AR function.", 
    "60": "Toads experiencing dehydrating conditions exhibit complex physiological and behavioral responses, some of which can potentially impact cutaneous gas exchange, an important component of total gas exchange. We measured the effect of dehydration on cutaneous gas exchange in the xeric-adapted toad Bufo woodhousei. First, two pharmacological agents were used to stimulate cutaneous blood flow--phentolamine (an alpha-blocker) and isoproterenol, a beta-stimulant and powerful cardio-accelerator--to determine a relationship between cutaneous blood flow and water loss. Both drugs increased heart rate and blood pressure, and caused visually evident extensive vasodilation of the skin. Untreated toads in a dry air stream took an average of 10.1+/-0.7 h to dehydrate to 80% body mass, while animals treated with isoproterenol and phentolamine requires only 7.2+/-0.8 h and 7.4+/-0.9 h, respectively. Rehydration, which was more rapid than dehydration, was similarly accelerated in pharmacologically treated toads. Cutaneous gas exchange (M(O2), M(CO2)) and C18O diffusing capacity (D(Skin)C18O) were then examined in unanesthetized toads under different states of body hydration. Blood gases and hematocrit were measured separately but under identical conditions. In fully hydrated toads at 23-25 degrees C, cutaneous gas exchange values were: M(O2) = 1.43+/-0.47 micromol g(-1) h(-1), M(CO2) = 1.75+/-0.85 micromol g(-1) h(-1), and the respiratory exchange ratio R = 1.36+/-0.56 (N=6, mean + 1 S.D.). D(Skin)C18O was 0.48+/-0.03 micromol g body mass(-1) h(-1) kPa. Following an enforced 20-25% loss of body water, D(Skin)C18O fell by nearly 50% to 0.28+/-0.09 micromol g(-1) h(-1) kPa. However, cutaneous M(O2), M(CO2) and R were unchanged at 1.48+/-0.15 micromol g(-1) h(-1), 1.72+/-0.29 micromol g(-1) h(-1) and 1.13+/-0.08 micromol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. Partial pressure of arterial (sciatic) oxygen, Pa(O2), normally about 12-13 kPa, remained unchanged by dehydration, but Pa(CO2) increased about 250% from 0.93+/-0.27 up to 2.27+/-0.93 kPa. The fall in D(Skin)C18O during dehydration presumably results at least in part from decreased cutaneous blood flow, possibly in an attempt to reduce the transcutaneous water loss that would otherwise result during dehydrating conditions. Concurrently, cutaneous M(CO2) is maintained under dehyrdating conditions by a greatly increased Pa(CO2) diffusion gradient across the skin. Thus, Bufo woodhousei appears able to restrict cutaneous blood flow without compromising vital cutaneous CO2 loss.", 
    "61": "Preexisting hypertension complicates 5% of all pregnancies. The objective of this study was to evaluate steady-state atenolol pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (n = 17) during the second trimester (2nd T), third trimester (3rd T), and 3 months postpartum. Pregnancy as compared to 3 months postpartum (nonpregnant control) resulted in significant (P < .05) changes, including the following: 42% (2nd T) and 50% (3rd T) increase in creatinine clearance, 38% (2nd T) and 36% (3rd T) increase in atenolol renal clearance, 12% (2nd T) and 11% (3rd T) decrease in atenolol half-life, 20% (2nd T) and 28% (3rd T) increase in cardiac output, 15% (2nd T) and 23% (3rd T) increase in resting heart rate, and 22% (2nd T) and 21% (3rd T) decrease in total peripheral resistance in subjects on steady-state oral atenolol for treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. In conclusion, the renal clearance of atenolol along with creatinine clearance is increased during pregnancy. However, this does not translate into an increase in apparent oral clearance of atenolol, possibly related to the high variability in bioavailability. Atenolol administration did not appear to change the pattern of the increase in cardiac output and the decrease in total peripheral resistance, which normally occurs during pregnancy.", 
    "62": "In the United States, carvedilol and metoprolol (tartrate or succinate) are the most commonly employed beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists for the treatment of heart failure. However, use of these agents in patients with heart failure remains extremely low despite overwhelming evidence of their beneficial short- and long-term effects. Because the myocardial pathophysiology associated with heart failure involves not only beta-1 adrenoreceptors but also beta-2 and alpha-1 adrenoreceptors, this indicates a more complex disease process that may require pan-receptor antagonism to provide optimal clinical benefit. Relative to metoprolol (tartrate or succinate), carvedilol represents an extremely complex molecular entity that not only possesses the ability to antagonize all of the principle adrenoreceptors involved in heart failure but also reduces oxidative stress and provides an antiarrhythmic benefit independent of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonism. Taken together, an interesting pharmacologic premise for the superiority of carvedilol relative to metoprolol (tartrate) may exist, but the lack of clinical trials comparing an optimal dose of either extended-release metoprolol (ie, succinate) or immediate-release metoprolol (ie, tartrate) to carvedilol limits the clinical application of the pharmacologic differences between the agents.",

Although many adjunctive drugs for stabilizing hemodynamic changes during ECT have been reported, side-effects of these drugs may delay recovery and discharge from hospital. The effects of landiolol, a novel ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocker, have been measured on seizure duration, hemodynamic changes, recovery from anesthesia, and cognitive function during mECT under propofol anesthesia. A total of 10 patients with depression in the remission phase, were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover manner. Administration of 0.1 mg/kg of landiolol immediately before anesthesia significantly blunted the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during convulsions compared with placebo; landiolol was not associated with excessive hypotension or bradycardia. Landiolol did not affect seizure duration, recovery from anesthesia, or cognitive function before or after ECT. These results suggest that landiolol can be used effectively and safely during mECT.",

CFC increased BDNF mRNA in the HF. These results suggest that exercise enhances CFC and that antagonism of the beta-adrenoreceptors attenuates this effect. The exercise-related induction of GAL gene expression in the LC may influence noradrenergic transmission to facilitate CFC.", 
    "94": "The off-label use of medicines is a widespread phenomenon in medical practice but discussion on the legality of using drugs outside their licensed indications is still ongoing. Prescription recommendations and prescribing habits can differ greatly. We have used a database tool to analyze replies to a batch of questions which included the question \"Is the off-label use of medications common?\". The analysis was carried out using the Disease Analyzer--mediplus patient database, which is a database tool registered in Germany. It enabled the anonymous access to a representative panel of physicians and patients. More than 1,500 medical practices representing approximately 2.5 million patients were analyzed in a cross-sectional or longitudinal manner. The Disease Analyzer--mediplus database is unique in that it has direct links to individual diagnoses and the corresponding therapy.", 
    "95": "The findings demonstrated that proton pump inhibitors (PPI), which are licensed for the treatment of gastric ulcer and gastric reflux, are also used off-label in gastritis. The off-label use varies from 30 - 40% of prescriptions. The data indicate that the prescribing behavior has been influenced by the ending of the patent protection on omeprazole. A second instance which has been identified involves the beta-blocker carvedilol, which is licensed for the treatment of heart failure (24% of the total number of patients receiving the drug) but it was found that other beta-blockers are used off-label in this indication at a rate of more than 10% of prescriptions.",

Reported exposure to potential triggers including negative and positive emotions, anger, sudden posture changes as response to a startling event, heavy physical exertion, heavy eating, and sudden temperature changes during a 2-hour hazard period prior to stroke onset were compared to the same period during the preceding day and to average exposures in the last year.", 
    "99": "Seventy-six patients (38%) reported exposure to at least one of the study triggers during the 2-hour hazard period. For all factors combined, the OR was 8.4 (95% CI 4.5 to 18.1). The OR for negative emotions was 14.0 (95% CI 4.4 to 89.7), for anger 14.0 (95% CI 2.8 to 253.6), and for sudden changes in body posture in response to a startling event 24.0 (95% CI 5.1 to 428.9). It is important to interpret the reported ORs as estimates of a short-term 2-hour period relative risk and not as cumulative risks.",

However, preload independence of E' has remained controversial, and E/E' may not consistently be predictive of LV filling pressures. Our objectives were to test the hypotheses that E' is affected by preload, and that alterations of preload, afterload, and contractility also affect E/E'. DESIGN, INTERVENTIONS, AND MEASUREMENTS: An open-chest dog model was used (n = 8). High-fidelity pressure and conductance catheters were used for pressure-volume relations, and E' was obtained by pulsed TD from the apical four-chamber view. Changes in preload and afterload were induced by vena caval and partial aortic occlusions, respectively. Data were collected during control phase and during infusions of dobutamine and esmolol to alter contractility.",

Similar results occurred with dobutamine and esmolol infusions. This preload sensitivity was reflected in E/E', which was inversely (rather than directly) correlated with LV diastolic pressure (r = - 0.67). E/E' was less affected by preload when diastolic dysfunction was induced by sustained partial aortic occlusion (time constant of relaxation increased from 46 +/- 19 to 53 +/- 21 ms, p < 0.001).", 
    "103": "E' was significantly influenced by preload with preserved LV function and low filling pressures (< 12 mm Hg); accordingly, E/E' was less predictive of LV filling pressures in this scenario. E/E' was more predictive of LV filling pressures in the presence of diastolic dysfunction.",

One of the major problems to do any of the above is the active bleeding which makes any intervention difficult. The neuropeptide hormone somatostatin administered exogenously has caused a reduction in portal hypertension and variceal bleeding in patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. We believe that the symptomatic use of somatostatin for variceal bleeding in Schistosoma mansoni infected subjects can reduce bleeding, thereby alleviating the pathology caused by schistosomiasis.",

Adolescent subjects, age range varying from 12-17 years will be selected, based on several inclusion criteria, most important being infection with Schistosoma mansoni with bleeding from oesophageal varices in the last 24 hours. One group of schistosomiasis patients will be treated with somatostatin and praziquantel, the other with propanolol and praziquantel. Survival graphs will be set up to correlate somatostatin administration with survival time. A two part questionnaire will be set up to control treatment outcomes.

    "111": "The incorporation of a protein-ligand binding assay into a centrifugal microfluidics platform is described. The platform itself is a disc-shaped polymer substrate, upon which a series of microfluidic channels and reservoirs have been machined. Centrifugal microfluidics platforms require no internal moving parts, and fluid propulsion is achieved solely through rotation of the disc. Fluid flow is controlled by passive valves, the opening of which is dependent on the angular frequency of the rotating platform, the channel dimensions, and the physical properties of the fluid. To evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating a protein-based assay onto the centrifugal microfluidics analytical platform, a class-selective, homogeneous assay for the detection of phenothiazine antidepressants was employed. This class of drugs is known to bind to calmodulin, a calcium binding protein. Specifically, a fusion protein between calmodulin and enhanced green fluorescent protein was utilized. Calmodulin undergoes a conformational change upon binding to phenothiazines that alters the fluorescence properties of the attached fluorescent protein, which can be correlated to the concentration of the drug present. Another important aspect of this work was to study the efficacy of the platform to perform reconstitution assays. To do this, the biological reagent was dried on the platform and rehydrated to carry out the assay. The ability to prealiquot reagents on the platform should enhance its versatility and portability. The integration of protein-based assays in this platform should be useful in the design of analytical systems for high-throughput screening of pharmaceuticals and clinical diagnostics.",

The resulting phase was packed into a glass column (1.8 x 0.5 (i.d.) cm) and used in on-line chromatographic system. Frontal displacement affinity chromatography was used to determine the dissociation constants (K(d)) of CGP 12177A (552.6 nM) and (S)-propranolol (84.3 nM). Zonal displacement chromatography using CGP 12177A as the marker and racemic mixtures of the antagonists nadolol and propranolol demonstrated that the immobilized beta(2)-AR retained its ability to specifically bind these compounds. Similar experiments with (R)- and (S)-propranolol demonstrated that the immobilized receptor retained its enantioselectivity as (S)-propranolol displaced the CGP 12177 marker to a great extent that the (R)-enantiomer. The addition of the agonist butoxamine to the mobile phase increased the retention of the CGP-12177A as did the addition of the agonist fenoterol. These results indicate that the immobilized beta(2)-AR retained its ability to undergo ligand-induced conformational changes. The data from this study suggest that the immobilized beta(2)-AR can be used to screen for ligand binding interactions in both the resting and active states of the receptor.",

In intact cells (the cell-attached configuration) using a pipette containing a Na+ -rich solution, estradiol was added to the bath solution, which does not have direct contact with the electrically isolated areas of membrane patch from which the single-channel currents were recorded. Estradiol increased the frequency of opening of the BK channels within a few minutes after its application. The effect of estradiol on the opening of the BK channels in acinar cells in male mice was greater than that in females. In Ca(2+)-measurement using fura-2 AM, estradiol did not increase the level of intracellular Ca2+ during a 5-minute observation period. The application of estradiol with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, did not increase BK channel opening. The application of estradiol with Rp-cAMPS, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), also inhibited the increase in channel opening. The addition of a catalytic unit of protein kinase A to the inside of the excised membrane patch increased the frequency of opening of the BK channels. These results suggest that estradiol interacts with beta-adrenergic receptor on the basolateral membrane and regulates the opening of BK channels by protein phosphorylation via a cyclic AMP pathway, without a change in the Ca2+ level.",

We investigated effects of treatment with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) on bone turnover, bone mineral density (BMD), and fracture risk. Within the Danish Osteoporosis Prevention Study (DOPS) a population based, comprehensive cohort study of 2016 perimenopausal women, associations between treatment with beta-blockers and bone turnover and BMD were assessed in a cross-sectional design at the start of study. Moreover, in a nested case-control design, fracture risk during the subsequent 5 years was assessed in relation to treatment with beta-blockers at baseline. Multiple regression- and logistic regression-analyses were performed. Treatment with beta-blockers was associated with a threefold increased fracture risk (OR(adj) 3.3; 95% CI: 1.1-9.4). Analyses on duration of treatment showed that women who had been treated for more than 8 years had a higher fracture risk (OR(adj) 5.3; 95% CI: 1.1-26.3) than those treated for less than 8 years (OR(adj) 2.4; 95% CI: 0.6-9.5). In addition, cross-sectional data showed 20% lower serum osteocalcin levels (an osteoblastic marker of bone formation) in women treated with beta-blockers compared to untreated women (P < 0.001), whereas BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck did not differ between groups. beta-Blockers may decrease the activity of bone-forming cells and thereby increase fracture risk. However, confirmative studies and studies exploring mechanisms of action are needed.",

    "129": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a nonadrenergic/noncholinergic (NANC) peptide with vasodilatative/inotropic action that may benefit the failing heart. However, precise mechanisms for its in vivo inotropic action remain unclear. To assess this, dogs with normal or failing (sustained tachypacing) hearts were instrumented for pressure-dimension analysis. In control hearts, CGRP (20 pmol/kg per minute) enhanced cardiac contractility (eg, +33+/-4.2% in end-systolic elastance) and lowered afterload (-14.2+/-2% in systemic resistance, both P<0.001). The inotropic response was markedly blunted by heart failure (+6.5+/-2%; P<0.001 versus control), whereas arterial dilation remained unaltered (-19.3+/-5%). CGRP-positive inotropy was not attributable to reflex activation because similar changes were observed in the presence of a ganglionic blocker. However, it was fully prevented by the beta-receptor antagonist (timolol), identifying a dominant role of sympatho-stimulatory signaling. In control hearts, myocardial interstitial norepinephrine assessed by microdialysis almost doubled in response to CGRP infusion, whereas systemic plasma levels were unchanged. In addition, CGRP receptors were not observed in ventricular myocardium but were prominent in coronary arteries and the stellate ganglia. Ventricular myocytes isolated from normal and failing hearts displayed no inotropic response to CGRP, further supporting indirect sympatho-stimulation as the primary in vivo mechanism. In contrast, the peripheral vasodilatative capacity of CGRP was similar in femoral vascular rings from normal and failing hearts in dogs. Thus, CGRP-mediated positive inotropy is load-independent but indirect and attributable to myocardial sympathetic activation rather than receptor-coupled stimulation in canine hearts. This mechanism is suppressed in heart failure, so that afterload reduction accounts for CGRP-enhanced function in this setting.", 
    "130": "Thrombopoietin (TPO) is known to be involved in megakariocytopoesis, but its role in the control of ovarian function is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine whether TPO can regulate the proliferation, apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cells, to identify possible intracellular mediators of TPO action, especially protein kinase A (PKA), and to define their interrelationships within ovarian cells. We investigated the effect of TPO treatment (0, 1, 10 or 100 ng/ml) on the following characteristics of cultured porcine ovarian follicles, determined using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, immunocytochemistry, RIA and ELISA: the expression of intracellular peptides associated with proliferation (PCNA), apoptosis (Bax), tyrosine kinase (TK, phosphotyrosine), Cdc2/p34 kinase, PKA and the transcription factor CREB-1, and the secretion of progesterone, androstenedione, estradiol-17beta, oxytocin, inhibin A, inhibin B, IGF-I, transforming growth factor-2beta (TGF-2beta) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3). The involvement of PKA-dependent pathways was examined by evaluating the effect of a PKA blocker (KT5720, 1 microg/ml), either alone or in combination with TPO, on the parameters listed above. A TPO-induced increase in expression of PCNA, Bax, PKA, TK, Cdc2/p34 and CREB was observed. Furthermore, TPO was able to inhibit androstenedione, estradiol, TGF-2beta and IGFBP-3 secretion, and to stimulate oxytocin, inhibin A, inhibin B and IGF-I secretion. Progesterone secretion was not stimulated. The PKA blocker KT5720, when given alone, reduced the expression of Bax and TGF-2beta, augmented the expression of PKA, CREB and oxytocin, but did not influence the secretion of progesterone, androstenedione, estradiol, IGFBP-3, inhibins A and B or IGF-I. When given together with TPO, the PKA blocker prevented or reversed the action of TPO on PKA, CREB, androstenedione, estradiol, IGFBP-3, oxytocin, but not its effect on Bax, TGF-2beta or inhibin B. On the other hand, treatment with KT5720 augmented the effect of TPO on progesterone, inhibin A and IGF-I. These results provide the first evidence that TPO may be a potent regulator of ovarian function (e.g. proliferation, apoptosis and the secretion of peptide hormones, steroids, growth factors and growth factor-binding protein, as well as of the expression of some intracellular messengers). Furthermore, they demonstrated the importance of PKA in controlling these functions and in mediating the effects of TPO on ovarian cells. It remains possible that other (TK- and Cdc2/p34-dependent) intracellular mechanisms are also involved in mediating TPO action on the ovary.",

However, medical management of heart failure in this patient group represents a challenge because of complex hemodynamics and a lack of evidence from large randomized controlled trials to guide therapy. This article will review the evidence of the use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta-blockers (BBs) in left heart failure, discuss the mechanisms of heart failure as they pertain to congenital heart disease and review the limited literature of the use of neurohormonal antagonists in congenital heart disease. Some recommendations for use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers in heart failure due various congenital heart lesions are offered. Well-designed clinical trials are urgently needed to extend the impressive reductions in morbidity and mortality achieved with neurohormonal blockade in left ventricular (LV) heart failure to adults with congenital heart disease.",

    "136": "Substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) is a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia that receives GABAergic projections from neostriatum and globus pallidus. Previous research has shown that local pharmacological manipulations of GABA in SNr can influence tremulous jaw movements in rats. Tremulous jaw movements are defined as rapid vertical deflections of the lower jaw that resemble chewing but are not directed at a particular stimulus, and evidence indicates that these movements share many characteristics with parkinsonian tremor in humans. In order to investigate the role of GABA in motor functions related to tremor, the present study tested the GABA uptake blocker beta-alanine for its ability to reduce pilocarpine-induced tremulous jaw movements. In a parallel experiment, the effect of an active dose of beta-alanine on dialysate levels of GABA in SNr was assessed using microdialysis methods. GABA levels in dialysis samples were measured using high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. beta-Alanine (250-500 mg/kg) significantly reduced tremulous jaw movements induced by pilocarpine (4.0 mg/kg). Moreover, systemic administration of beta-alanine at a dose that reduced tremulous jaw movements (500 mg/kg) resulted in a substantial increase in extracellular levels of GABA in SNr compared to the pre-injection baseline. Thus, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that GABAergic tone in SNr plays a role in the regulation of tremulous jaw movements. This research may lead to a better understanding of how parkinsonian symptoms are modulated by SNr GABA mechanisms.", 
    "137": "In early morning hours, a rise of serum cytokines such as IL-6 was described. This study aimed to find reasons for this phenomenon focussing on NE and corticosterone. Mouse spleen slices were electrically stimulated (ES) in a microsuperfusion chamber in order to release endogenous NE. ES inhibited IL-6 secretion when animals were sacrificed at 03:00 and 06:00 (both p<0.001) but it increased its secretion from spleen slice removed at 09:00 (p=0.026). Prior administration of corticosterone or the glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 abrogated these ES effects. Endogenous NE via alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors mediated this time-dependent differential effects. This study demonstrates that cooperation of endogenous NE and corticosterone are involved in a time-dependent fall or rise of splenic IL-6 secretion.",

ER-MP 12 monocyte progenitors were isolated and differentiated into macrophages in vitro 72 hr later. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cytokine production was measured with and without epinephrine, IL-10 and anti-IL-10 antibody. Epinephrine significantly increased IL-10 production, but attenuated TNF-alpha release exclusively through beta2 adrenergic receptors, and is independent of IL-10 production.

    "140": "A novel compound KR-31378 [(2S,3S,4R)-N''-cyano-N-(6-amino-3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2-methly-2-dimethoxy-methly-2H-benzo-pyran-4-yl)-N-benzylguanidine] has been demonstrated as an anti-ischemic agent in rat heart and brain. Here, we report the effects of this compound on hypoxia-induced cell death and possible signaling pathways in heart-derived H9c2 cells. Treatment with KR-31378 (3-30 microM) 1 h before and during hypoxia significantly reduced hypoxia-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, increase in hypoxia-induced transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was reduced by KR-31378, suggesting its antiapoptotic potential in H9c2 cells. The protective effect conferred by KR-31378 (10 microM) was abolished by cotreatment with 5-hydroxydecanoate (5HD), a specific blocker of the mitochondrial KATP (mtKATP) channel, but not by HMR-1883 (1-[[5-[2-(5-chloro-o-anisamido)ethyl]-methoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-3-methylthiourea), a specific blocker of the sarcolemmal KATP channel. We observed that the treatment with KR-31378 could increase the expression of protein kinase C (PKC)-epsilon protein, but not other PKC isotypes (-alpha, -beta, -delta, -zeta), in the particulate fraction. This increased level of PKC-epsilon was sustained during the hypoxic period up to 8 h. In addition, our results showed that treatment with KR-31378 induced the expression of PKC-epsilon mRNA as early as 15 min after the treatment. A specific inhibitor for PKC-epsilon isoform, epsilonV1-2, completely blocked the protective effect of KR-31378 against hypoxia-induced cell death. In conclusion, our results suggest that KR-31378 can protect cultured H9c2 cells from hypoxia-induced death via the mtKATP channel and PKC-epsilon.", 
    "141": "Though two isoforms of nitric oxide synthase, iNOS and eNOS, were reported in adipocytes, the role of NO in adipose tissue is still ambiguous. The aims of the present study were 1) to follow the effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), on 24 h-lipolysis in rat epididymal adipocyte culture in relation to iNOS stimulation; 2) to compare LPS-induced NO effects with exogenously NO, delivered as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), and 3) to examine the possible role of NO signaling agonist in lipolysis mediated by the beta(3)-adrenoreceptor agonist. Lipolysis was measured by glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA) production. The medium nitrite levels were used for the indirect estimation of NOS expression. Adipocyte mitochondrial function was assessed by the MTT test. LPS produced a concentration-dependent increase of NO with a decrease of viability at the highest dose. However, LPS did not affect lipolysis. SNAP did not exhibit significant changes in glycerol, FFA or MTT. BRL-37344 and db-cAMP significantly increased nitrite, glycerol and FFA levels. There was a positive correlation between glycerol release and nitrite production. Moreover, BRL-37344 significantly reduced mitochondrial functions. The pretreatment with bupranolol, beta(3)-antagonist, restored all parameters affected by BRL-37344. These results support a concept that NO fulfils multifaceted role of stimulating lipolysis under physiological conditions (beta-agonistic effect) and modulating the same processes during inflammatory (LPS) processes.",

    "143": "Essential hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the Western world, yet it remains poorly controlled. Single drug-antihypertensive therapy is unsuccessful in up to half of all patients with hypertension; although lack of adherence may account for a proportion of this, there is evidence of considerable variation in the response of different hypertensive patients to different drug classes. A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature, with a view to predicting an individual's response to different antihypertensive agents. However, even using such algorithms, hypertension control remains problematic, and they are frequently difficult to apply in everyday clinical practice. Initiation of treatment with low-dose combination antihypertensive therapy, using a drug which reduces total body sodium and/or volume in combination with a drug which blocks the renin-angiotensin system, provides an effective and easily applicable means to improve hypertension control in the primary care setting.", 
    "144": "This paper presents the results of HPLC enantioseparation of derivatives of aryloxyaminopropanols obtained using six chiral stationary phases [macrocyclic antibiotic (vancomycin, teicoplanin, teicoplanin aglycone, and methylated teicoplanin aglycone) and cyclodextrin (beta and gamma)] and a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/acetic acid/triethylamine (45/55/0.3/0.2) as the mobile phase. No significant difference was observed in the separation of the enantiomers on the vancomycin and teicoplanin chiral stationary phases. Comparing the separation of enantiomers on teicoplanin-based columns the retention factors were increased in the order: native teicoplanin < teicoplanin aglycone < methylated teicoplanin aglycone. The highest values of resolution were obtained on the column containing carbohydrate moieties. The presence of saccharide moieties in the chiral stationary phase plays an important role, together with charge interactions and steric interactions, in the separation of enantiomers of derivatives of aryloxyaminopropanol.", 
    "145": "New evidence from recently completed clinical studies performed with nebivolol, a highly selective beta-1 beta-blocker, endowed with additional vasodilating activity mediated by nitric oxide (NO) endothelial release, confirm previous findings that nebivolol differs from other beta-blocking agents and that the combination of beta-1 blockade and NO-mediated vasodilation not only potentiates the blood pressure lowering activity, but leads to a broader favourable haemodynamic profile, which is clinically relevant to the treatment of hypertensive patients. In particular, six new studies focusing on the vasodilation properties of nebivolol demonstrated that: (i) its blood pressure lowering effect is accompanied by a vasodilating action that is seen after single and chronic administration of the usual antihypertensive oral dose of 5 mg once daily; (ii) the vasodilation can be documented systemically, at various regional vascular beds and skin microcirculation, and is accompanied by increased small arterial distensibility; (iii) the NO-endothelium-dependency of its vasodilating action is shown by the model of forearm or cutaneous vasodilating response to acetylcholine and by the blockade of the nebivolol-induced local vasodilation by a blocker of the arginine-NO cascade, L-NMMA. Two more studies demonstrated the ability of nebivolol to increase NO concentrations through preservation of NO from oxidative degradation, and not only by stimulation of its synthesis. Finally, two studies confirmed the favourable haemodynamic action of nebivolol on both systolic and diastolic function and, in particular, an increase in stroke volume, associated with reduction in vascular resistance, resulting in a maintained cardiac output despite reduced heart rate. These properties consistently differentiate nebivolol from non-vasodilating beta-blockers, such as those used for the active comparative studies, i.e. atenolol, metoprolol or bisoprolol. The observation that nebivolol enhances or restores NO-mediated vasodilation in hypertensive patients has important therapeutic implications in view of the well-established protective role of NO against cardiovascular risk factors, and particularly the development of atherosclerosis. Similarly, the favourable haemodynamic profile of nebivolol, as described by the new investigations (preservation of cardiac output, reduction of peripheral resistance and improved diastolic function) appear to have clinically relevant benefits on the impairment in systolic and/or diastolic function often complicating the hypertension.", 
    "146": "Nebivolol is a new and selective beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist whose haemodynamic profile is different from that of classical beta-blockers. The blood pressure lowering effects of nebivolol are, at least partially, due to the direct vasodilation as a result of nitric oxide (NO) release from endothelial cells. Several in vitro studies unequivocally show that, at least in certain vascular districts (particularly in small diameter, non-conduit vessels) and in platelets, nebivolol can stimulate an increase of endothelial NO, which becomes available at the smooth muscle layers and induces vasorelaxation. Nebivolol appears to interact with the endothelial NO pathway in two complementary ways: it increases NO synthase (NOS) activity and reduces the NO-scavenging radical superoxide anion, by re-directing deranged NOS activity, from superoxide to NO production. Nebivolol appears also to possess a complementary antioxidant activity, through which the pathological ROS-induced depression of intracellular NO levels can be prevented. Depending on the studies, evidences for a role of different receptors have been obtained. Although the interaction of nebivolol with cell receptors and the mechanisms of signal transduction into eNOS activation are not yet fully delineated, that nebivolol increases NO production and extracellular release has been proved not only by confirming its inhibition by NOS blockers, but also by measuring NO levels in mediums and cells in several different experimental settings.",

    "152": "In the livers of humans and many other mammalian species, beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs) play an important role in the modulation of glucose production by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. In male mice and rats, however, the expression and physiological role of hepatic beta2-ARs are rapidly lost with development under normal physiological conditions. We previously described a line of transgenic mice, F28 (Andre C, Erraji L, Gaston J, Grimber G, Briand P, and Guillet JG. Eur J Biochem 241: 417-424, 1996), which carry the human beta2-AR gene under the control of its own promoter. In these mice, hepatic beta2-AR levels are shown to increase rapidly after birth and, as in humans, be maintained at an elevated level in adulthood. F28 mice display strongly enhanced adenylyl cyclase responses to beta-AR agonists in their livers and, compared with normal mice, have increased basal hepatic adenylyl cyclase activity. In this report we demonstrate that, under normal physiological conditions, this increased beta2-AR activity affects the expression of the gluconeogenic and glycolytic key enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and l-pyruvate kinase and considerably decreases hepatic glycogen levels. Furthermore, we show that the effects of beta-adrenergic ligands on liver glycogen observed in humans are reproduced in these mice: liver glycogen levels are strongly decreased by the beta2-AR agonist clenbuterol and increased by the beta-AR antagonist propranolol. These transgenic mice open new perspectives for studying in vivo the hepatic beta2-AR system physiopathology and for testing the effects of beta-AR ligands on liver metabolism.", 
    "153": "To determine the role played by the beta-adrenergic and corticosteroid systems in the modulatory effects of stress on declarative memory function, 42 young men were administered a placebo, propranolol (beta-adrenergic blocker), or metyrapone (corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor) before being submitted to a psychological stress protocol. Immediately after stress, subjects viewed a neutral story, unrelated to the stressor. Short- (5 min post learning) and long-term (1 wk post learning) recall of the story was assessed. Placebo and propranolol groups showed significant stress-related increases in corticosteroid levels, whereas metyrapone prevented corticosteroid reactivity to the stressor. Stress triggered significant elevations in cardiac activity (heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels) in all three groups, with the metyrapone group showing the strongest elevation in heart rate levels in response to stress. Compared with placebo, propranolol had no effect on short- and long-term recall of the story learned after stress, whereas metyrapone impaired short-term recall of the story, with no further effects on long-term declarative memory. These results suggest that, contrary to the beta-adrenergic system, the corticosteroid system is implicated in declarative memory function after stress in humans.",

    "156": "The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study showed that treatment with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonist losartan reduces overall stroke risk compared with conventional therapy with the beta-blocker atenolol. We conducted secondary analyses in LIFE to determine the extent to which the cerebrovascular benefits of losartan apply to different clinical subgroups and stroke subtypes and to assess the dependence of these benefits on baseline and time-varying covariates. Among 9193 hypertensive patients with electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, random allocation to losartan-based treatment lowered the risk of fatal (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.96; P=0.032) and atherothrombotic stroke (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.88; P=0.001) compared with atenolol-based therapy. Although comparable risk reductions occurred for hemorrhagic and embolic stroke, these were not statistically significant. The number of neurological deficits per stroke was similar, but there were fewer strokes in the losartan group for nearly every level of stroke severity. Effects were consistent in all clinical subgroups except for those defined by age and ethnicity. The benefits of losartan on all strokes were independent of baseline and time-varying risk factors, including blood pressure. The number needed to treat for 5 years to prevent 1 stroke was 54 for the average participant, declining to 25, 24, and 9 for patients with cerebrovascular disease, isolated systolic hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, respectively. In conclusion, substantial cerebrovascular benefit could be realized with the institution of losartan-based therapy over conventional therapy among hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk.",

Treatments for the experiment included corn, wheat, and barley (early finisher period); and corn, corn + RAC, wheat, wheat + RAC, barley, and barley + RAC for the late finisher period. Ractopamine was fed at the level of 10 mg/kg (as-fed basis) of feed. Pigs were allotted to early finisher period treatments at approximately 45 kg BW. Pigs were then given late finisher period treatments at approximately 80 kg BW and fed for 28 d. The dietary digestible lysine level for all diets was maintained at 2.7 g/Mcal of ME. Pigs fed the wheat and corn diets during the late finisher period had a greater (P <0.05) G:F than those fed the barley diets. Pigs fed diets with RAC had lower (P <0.05) leaf fat weights, 10th-rib fat, last-rib fat, and belly firmness and had improved (P <0.05) dressing percents and loin muscle areas compared with those not receiving RAC. Pigs fed the wheat diets had a greater (P <0.05) dressing percent than those receiving the barley diets, but pigs fed the barley diets had a higher (P <0.05) Minolta L* for fat color than pigs fed wheat. Pigs fed diets containing RAC produced pork that was less tender (P <0.05) compared with pigs that did not receive RAC. Linoleic acid percent values were higher (P <0.05) for pigs fed diets with RAC than in those that did not.

    "162": "Paired organotypic explants from rat occipital cortex were cultured for up to three weeks in the presence of selective blockers of amino acid receptor blockers, during which period spontaneous action potential generation was monitored electrophysiologically. In contrast to isolated explants (Corner, M.A., van Pelt, J., Wolters, P.S., Baker, R.E.and Nuytinck, R.H. (2002) Physiological e.ects of sustained blockade of excitatory synaptic transmission on spontaneously active developing neuronal networks--an inquiry into the reciprocal linkage between intrinsic biorhythms and neuroplasticity in early ontogeny. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev., 26: 127-185), which upregulated their initially depressed spontaneous bursting activity only under conditions of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade, cross-innervated co-cultures showed a large degree of functional recovery even when combined NMDA and AMPA receptor blockade was carried out. This compensatory activity could be eliminated by acute addition of a selective kainate receptor blocker to the medium. When kainate along with AMPA and NMDA receptor mediated activity was chronically suppressed, however, considerable functional recovery--in the form of recurrent burst discharges--took place gradually over a period of three weeks in vitro. These spontaneous bursts disappeared rapidly upon treatment with the muscarinic receptor blocker, atropine, but continuous low-level firing emerged at the same time. Similar \"tonic\" background activity was induced in control cultures as well, but without any noticeable reduction in burst discharges. Co-cultured neocortex explants, in which cyto-morphological maturation proceeds to a far greater degree than in isolated explants (Baker, R.E.and van Pelt, J. (1997) Co-cultured but not isolated cortical explants display normal dendritic development: a longterm quantitative study. Dev. Brain Res., 98: 21-27) are evidently capable of an astonishing degree of functional compensation for loss of excitatory synaptic drive during development. It could be shown, furthermore, that such homeostatic responses are not mediated largely by a weakening of inhibitory mechanisms in the absence of spontaneous firing. Chronic inhibitory synaptic blockade, on the other hand, led to intensified bursting activity which gradually normalized over a 3-week culture period. The cellular basis for this reversal of the disinhibited state, as well as for the residual neuronal firing even after cholinergic mechanisms have been largely eliminated, is at present unknown. The degree to which immature cortical networks attempt to compensate for altered levels of physiological activity, as documented in the present report, is another indication of how important such activity can be for normal development (see Corner, M.A., van Pelt, J., Wolters, P.S., Baker, R.E. and Nuytinck, R.H. (2002) Physiological e.ects of sustained blockade of excitatory synaptic transmission on spontaneously active developing neuronal networks-an inquiry into the reciprocal linkage between intrinsic biorhythms and neuroplasticity in early ontogeny. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev., 26: 127-185).. At the same time, the large variations in overall firing levels and \"macro-scale\" temporal patterns from culture to culture within a given series, despite all attempts at identical preparation of the explants, can only mean that the \"set-points\" for such regulation are themselves subject to unknown ontogenetic factors which, apparently, are nonuniformly distributed even within a restricted region of the neocortex. On the other hand, it was striking to note that, regardless of age or treatment, an unexpected degree of consistency in temporal patterning existed at \"mini-\" and \"micro-\" time-scales (viz., EEG delta and beta frequency ranges, respectively) even when network bursting tendencies became greatly reduced in favor of tonic firing.",

Although harmaline tremor is a well known animal model of ET, it has not found utility as a preclinical drug screen and has not been validated with anti-ET medications. We measured harmaline tremor in rats (10 mg/kg s.c.) and mice (20 mg/kg s.c.) with a load sensor under the cage floor and performed spectral analysis on 20-minute epochs. The motion power over the tremor frequency bandwidth (8-12 Hz in rats; 10-16 Hz in mice) was divided by the motion power over the full motion frequency range (0-15 Hz in rats; 0-34 Hz in mice). The use of these measures greatly reduced data variability, permitting experiments with small sample sizes. Three drugs that suppress ET (propranolol, ethanol, and octanol) all significantly suppressed harmaline-induced tremor. We propose that, with this methodology, harmaline-induced tremor may be useful as a preclinical method to identify potential medications for ET.", 
    "164": "Spontaneous or agonist-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle can be observed very early in fetal life, thus explaining the possible occurrence of bronchospasm in very low birth weight infants within the first days of life. In an attempt to better manage such bronchospasms, the aim of the present study was to investigate the age-specific modifications in airway smooth muscle relaxation to beta2-agonists and muscarinic antagonists using a combination of functional and molecular techniques. In the rat, isometric relaxation to the beta2-agonist salbutamol was examined in tracheae; we also examined muscarinic receptor expression (M2R and M3R mRNA levels) in airway smooth muscle by immunochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR. Compared with adults, salbutamol-induced relaxation was twofold greater in immature rat isolated tracheae preconstricted by carbachol. This effect was associated with a lower expression of M2R in the smooth muscle of immature animals (sixfold and almost twofold as assessed by immunochemistry and Western blotting, respectively). Real-time PCR data indicate that changes in M2R expression according to age occurred at a posttranscriptional level. In adult airways, there was a significantly greater functional efficacy of M2R blockade by methoctramine compared with that shown in immature rats. Because of the limited availability of human neonate lung tissue, only the molecular part of the study was performed, and we observed a qualitatively similar effect, i.e., a lower M2R expression in the neonatal airway smooth muscle, although this was quantitatively smaller. We conclude that beta2-agonist-induced relaxation is enhanced in immature compared with adult airways as a result of greater postjunctional M2R expression in adult airway smooth muscle. This finding may be of importance in the clinical management of bronchoconstriction in neonates.",

P values were 0.6 for FVC, 0.8 for FEV1, and 0.5 for FEF25-75. The lacrimal occlusion did not affect heart rate and blood pressures. Three subjects complained of epiphora.", 
    "176": "Lacrimal occlusion with intracanalicular collagen plugs may almost completely prevent the bronchoconstriction caused by topical timolol in asthmatics by inhibiting or decreasing systemic absorption of the medication.", 
    "177": "We performed QSAR analysis of beta2-adrenergic activity and chromatographic data of 4,6,8-trihydroxy-, 6,7-dihydroxy- and 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives. TLC plates (silica gel NP 60F(254) and silica gel RP2 60F(254) silanised precoated), impregnated with solutions of analogues of the selected amino acids were used as beta2-agonistic and antagonistic interaction models. QSAR analysis of the beta2-adrenergic activity and the chromatographic data of the solutes were made. A correlation between biological data and behaviour of the examined compounds in a chromatographic modifiable environment (S1-S3) was investigated by the linear regression analysis method."
