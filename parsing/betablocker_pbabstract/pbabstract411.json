A double-blind randomized comparative study was conducted between celiprolol and amiloride-hydrochlorothiazide in 40 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Both drugs were effective in the therapeutical control of hypertension, although reductions in systolic blood pressure were more significant among the celiprolol group, being the percentage of patients with reduction of diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg., 89.5% in the celiprolol group and 82.4% in the amiloride group. The average dose of celiprolol used was 200 mg/day, with few mide effects.", 
    "1": "The use of beta-adrenergic antagonists for the control of high blood pressure associated to pregnancy is frequent. Their use is related with the appearance of undesirable effects of the fetus. The case of neonatal cardiac arrest attributed, to the administration of labetalol to the mother is presented. The high transplacentary passage, the different pharmacokinetics of the drug in the newborn and the clinical evolution of the patient suggests its involvement. It is concluded that labetalol may cause severe undesirable effects in newborns and fetal heart rate of the mother and neonate should be monitored upon use of this drug.", 
    "2": "There is no consensus regarding the minimum acceptable frequency response for a system intended for routine monitoring of invasive blood pressure in the operating rooms or intensive care units. Part of the problem stems from the diverse criteria used to validate faithful reproduction of the pressure waveform and waveform parameters. Another part of the problem is related to the site of pressure measurement: some anatomic sites have waveforms that are more difficult to reproduce than others. The most often quoted criteria, around which many clinical blood pressure monitoring systems have been constructed, are based on reproduction of all details of the pressure waveform from the most demanding anatomic sites. However, the routine clinical setting is primarily concerned with obtaining accurate values for systolic and diastolic blood pressures as recorded from peripheral arterial sites. This study was designed to obtain worst-case, in the sense of most difficult to measure, blood pressure waveforms from the femoral artery and the left ventricle using a canine model. The purpose of worst-case analysis was to create pressure waveforms that were at both extremes of frequency content, i.e., a rapidly beating heart with extraordinary contractility and a more slowly beating heart with little contractility. The premise of this type of analysis is that all naturally occurring pressure waveforms within a very broad physiologic range would fall within these extremes; therefore, the ability to measure the extreme waveforms would imply the ability to measure all those in between. Worst-case waveforms chosen from among 360 pressure waveforms were analyzed to determine the minimum frequency content of each waveform that would be required for faithful reproduction of systolic and diastolic pressures and the dP/dt. The criterion for faithful reproduction was chosen to be +/- 5% or 1 mmHg, whichever is greater. Data from the worst-case canine study, with supporting data collected intraoperatively from three patients, demonstrate that systolic and diastolic pressures can be obtained from a peripheral measurement site within 5%, requiring only two harmonics in conjunction with an appropriately low-pass-filtered catheter manometer system. Left ventricular pressure waveforms require five harmonics to reproduce the systolic and diastolic pressures within 5% or 1.0 mmHg, whichever is greater. Determination of the maximum dP/dt within +/- 5% from the worst-case peripheral and left ventricular waveforms required 20 and 22 harmonics, respectively.", 
    "3": "The effects of intrahypothalamic administration of norfenfluramine (NFFL), an anorectic agent that increases serotonergic transmission, on plasma concentrations of glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), and their regulating hormones were investigated in resting and exercising rats. Infusion of 5 micrograms NFFL in 0.125 microliter aCSF/min into the nucleus paraventricularis of the hypothalamus (PVN) caused a significant increase of blood glucose, plasma epinephrine (E), and corticosterone concentrations. Plasma levels of FFA, insulin, or norepinephrine (NE) remained unchanged. Lower doses of NFFL (0.5 and 0.05 microgram/min) did not affect peripheral metabolism. The effects of NFFL in the PVN were completely prevented by prior administration of a 5-HT1 antagonist, (S)-(-)propranolol. The exercise-induced increase of plasma NE was reduced after prior administration of 5 micrograms NFFL/min into the PVN. Plasma E responses tended to be increased. The exercise-induced alterations in glucose, FFA, corticosterone, and insulin were not affected by NFFL infusion into the PVN. The data suggest that activation of serotonergic mechanisms in the PVN might change the neurohormonal response to a stressor favouring the release of adrenal hormones above activation of the neuronal branch of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "4": "The stability of metoprolol tartrate 0.40 mg/mL in 5% dextrose injection or 0.9% sodium chloride injection in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags stored at 24.0 +/- 2.4 degrees C was studied. Triplicate admixtures of each solution were prepared. A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was used to determine metoprolol tartrate concentrations. At 0, 6, 12, 24, and 36 hours, samples were visually assessed then assayed in duplicate. Stability was defined as a < 10% decline in metoprolol tartrate concentration from the time 0 determination. No notable color changes or precipitation was observed in any sample. All samples demonstrated a < 7% reduction in metoprolol tartrate concentration over 36 hours. Metoprolol tartrate 0.40 mg/mL admixed in 5% dextrose injection or 0.9% sodium chloride injection in PVC bags and stored at 24.0 +/- 2.4 degrees C was stable for 36 hours.", 
    "5": "To determine developmental changes of brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic activity at defined circadian and thermal states, we evaluated the time course of cold-induced increases of in vitro guanosine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) binding in parallel with whole body metabolism (oxygen consumption, VO2) and core temperature (Tc) in 1- to 11-day-old rat pups. During the maximum phase of the juvenile diurnal cycle, Tc of littermates was recorded continuously and VO2 alternately until 2 min before animals were killed for removal of interscapular BAT. GDP binding after 1.5 h at thermoneutrality and its increase during physiologically comparable cold loads were significantly lower in 1-day-old pups than in 5- and 11-day-old pups. Cold defense was activated more rapidly in the older pups, but GDP binding in even the 1-day-old pups was significantly increased during the second 10-min period of cold exposure. We conclude that rapid changes in thermogenic activity, in connection with the known developmental changes in the dependence of the suckling rat's metabolic cold defense on maternal and sibling contact and circadian phase, will distort longitudinal studies of any fast-changing BAT parameter when the conditions immediately before tissue removal are not thoroughly controlled.", 
    "6": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of labetalol on uterine blood flow and cardiovascular parameters in acutely instrumented, hypertensive gravid baboons.", 
    "7": "During the latter half of pregnancy six gravid baboons were acutely instrumented, with ultrasonic flow probes placed on ipsilateral, external iliac, and uterine arteries and a flow-directed pulmonary artery catheter in the pulmonary artery. After a stable arterial pressure baseline was obtained, norepinephrine was infused to increase mean arterial pressure by at least 20%. A 20-minute hypertensive steady state was obtained. Labetalol at 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg was randomly infused, followed by a 2.0 mg/kg dose, each over 1 minute. A 20-minute recovery period followed every labetalol infusion, allowing the hypertensive steady state to reestablish. External iliac and uterine blood flow measurements were continuously recorded during the baseline and experimental trials. Mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressure, central venous pressure, and cardiac output were obtained at 5, 10, and 15 minutes during each steady state and after each labetalol infusion.", 
    "8": "Labetalol at all dosages significantly reduced the mean arterial pressure and the systemic vascular resistance at 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg. External iliac blood flow was not consistently significantly reduced; however, uterine blood flow was significantly reduced after the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg labetalol dosages (p < 0.05). Although uterine vascular resistance tended to increase after the 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg doses, statistical significance was not achieved.",

    "10": "Extrarenal potassium disposal plays an important role in the tolerance of an acute potassium load and is particularly critical in patients with renal failure. Insulin is known to stimulate this disposal by enhancing potassium uptake into the cells. Since dietary potassium is generally ingested in combination with carbohydrates, the predictable stimulation of endogenous insulin release may blunt the expected increase in plasma potassium. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of oral glucose on the disposition of an acute oral potassium load in hemodialysis patients and in normal controls.", 
    "11": "Eight hemodialysis patients and eight normal control subjects were studied after an overnight fast. Each subject received an oral load of potassium chloride elixir (0.25 mmol/kg). Plasma potassium was measured at baseline and at 30-minute intervals for 3 hours. On a separate study day, the subjects underwent the identical protocol, with the addition of 50 g of oral glucose to the potassium load to stimulate endogenous insulin release. The identical two experimental protocols were repeated in each subject during concomitant beta blockade with propranolol.", 
    "12": "The maximal increase in plasma potassium after the potassium load was significantly greater in the hemodialysis patients than in the controls (0.93 +/- 0.08 versus 0.52 +/- 0.04 mmol/L, p < 0.001). Concomitant oral glucose markedly blunted the maximal rise in potassium levels in both experimental groups (0.40 +/- 0.09 and 0.22 +/- 0.07 mmol/L, respectively, p < 0.005 versus potassium alone). With concomitant beta blockade, the maximal increase in plasma potassium after the potassium load was significantly greater in the hemodialysis patients than in the controls (1.11 +/- 0.12 versus 0.72 +/- 0.09 mmol/L, p = 0.02). Concomitant oral glucose again markedly blunted the maximal increase in potassium in both experimental groups (0.72 +/- 0.09 and 0.39 +/- 0.06 mmol/L, respectively, p < 0.01 versus potassium alone). The potassium load in the absence of glucose did not produce changes in plasma insulin concentration in either experimental group. The potassium load in combination with oral glucose load produced more sustained hyperinsulinemia in the dialysis patients than in the control subjects.", 
    "13": "Exogenous glucose, by stimulating endogenous secretion of insulin, enhances extrarenal disposal of a potassium load. This protective effect of exogenous glucose against hyperkalemia is independent of adrenergic stimulation. The beneficial effect of exogenous glucose defends against the development of severe hyperkalemia after dietary potassium ingestion, and is critically important in hemodialysis patients, due to their negligible renal potassium excretion.", 
    "14": "Small-conductance, ATP-sensitive K(+)-channels (KATP) localized in apical membranes of both thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and cortical collecting duct cells may be involved in Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion in the mammalian kidney. Possible pharmacologic tools to evaluate such an hypothesis may be the antidiabetic sulfonylureas which block K(+)-channels in pancreatic beta-cells. In saline-loaded conscious rats, glyburide (GLY) dose-dependently increased urinary Na+ excretion with little change in urinary K+ excretion after i.p. administration (10-100 mg/kg). In renal clearance studies, GLY at 25 mg/kg i.v. increased Na+ excretion 350% during the first hour post-treatment without affecting K+ excretion, glomerular filtration rate, mean arterial pressure or heart rate. GLY at 50 mg/kg was no more natriuretic than the 25 mg/kg dose, whereas 12.5 mg/kg of GLY increased Na+ excretion 200%. The change in Na+ excretion produced by 25 mg/kg of GLY in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats was significantly greater than the change after drug vehicle in these animals. It is unlikely that the natriuresis produced by GLY is secondary to changes in plasma insulin and/or glucose because the doses used were far above GLY's insulin-releasing action (i.e., all natriuretic doses would have produced maximal insulin release) and GLY was natriuretic in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. It is possible that GLY interferes with reabsorption of Na+ by blocking KATP and thereby interrupting K+ recycling and Na(+)-2Cl(-)-K+ cotransport in the loop of Henle.", 
    "15": "The interaction of tertatolol (d,l-hydroxy-2'-t-butylamino-3'propyloxy-8-thiochromane HCl) with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT) receptors in several brain areas were investigated. Both ligand binding techniques and an electrophysiological approach were used. First, the affinity of tertatolol for different 5-HT receptor subtypes was measured, as assayed by a competition binding experiment using specific ligands in several brain areas. It was found that (-)-tertatolol binds to 5-HT1 receptor subtypes in rat brain, particularly the 5-HT1A subtype in the hippocampus (Ki = 5.9 nM). (-)-Tertatolol showed much lower affinity for 5-HT1B (Ki = 118.4 nM), 5-HT1C (Ki = 699.6 nM) and 5-HT2 (Ki = 678.6 nM) receptors. The binding of tertatolol to hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors was stereospecific in that the affinity of (+)-tertatolol to these receptors (Ki = 311.6 nM) was about 20 times lower as compared to that of (-)-tertatolol. There was no significant binding of tertatolol to 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, alpha-1 adrenergic receptors or to the serotonin uptake site. Electrophysiological techniques were used to study the effects of (-)-tertatolol on the activity of 5-HT-containing neurons in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus. Acute i.v. injection of (-)-tertatolol caused a slight increase in the basal firing rate of the majority of 5-HT neurons studied. Pretreatment with (-)-tertatolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-proylamino) tetralin (0.25-64 micrograms/kg i.v.) on the firing rate of dorsal raphe nucleus 5-HT neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "The effect of propranolol dosing rate on beta-blockade was studied in human volunteers after administration of a conventional tablet and a sustained release capsule. The slope of the plot of the percentage of reduction in the heart rate against log plasma propranolol concentration was significantly greater after administration of a sustained release capsule than after administration of a conventional tablet. A marked leftward shift of the plasma concentration-response curve was also observed in rabbits as the infusion rate was decreased over the same infusion period. This shift was not altered by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine and plasma catecholamine levels were not affected by the rate of infusion, indicating that the contribution of sympathetic activation to the effect was minimal. By contrast to the anticlockwise hysteresis of the temporal response after propranolol, no such hysteresis was found with the more hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, or was there any leftward shift in the plasma concentration- response relationship. Data from the isolated guinea pig atrial preparation also showed anticlockwise hysteresis and a leftward shift of the concentration-response curve at a low propranolol input rate, whereas no shift was observed with more hydrophilic beta-blockers such as atenolol, pindolol and metoprolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Exogenous and endogenous sex steroid hormones influence GH secretion. To test the relative importance of androgens in the enhancement of GH secretion, we administered flutamide (a potent androgen receptor blocker) to six late pubertal males. Blood samples for GH (and LH) were obtained at 10-min intervals for 24-h periods after 3 days of flutamide and during the untreated state. Waveform-specific, multiple-parameter deconvolution analysis was employed to assess secretory and elimination dynamics for GH. Androgen receptor blockade was confirmed by significant increases in 24-h mean LH concentrations and in total 17 beta-estradiol and free testosterone levels in the serum. Mean serum GH concentrations (24-h) also increased (P < 0.001) during androgen receptor blockade (mean +/- SEM, 2.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms/L); this was associated with an increased (P < 0.001) GH production rate [152 +/- 15 vs. 93 +/- 16 micrograms/liter of distribution volume (Lv)/24 h]. The enhanced GH secretion during flutamide administration was a result of both increased mass of GH released per secretory burst (12.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 8.4 +/- 1.0 micrograms/Lv; P < 0.005) and increased maximal rate of GH secretion (0.39 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.30 +/- 0.03 micrograms/Lv/min; P < 0.05), as well as a small increase in the number of detectable secretory bursts (12 +/- 1 vs. 10 +/- 1/24 h; P < 0.05). There was no significant change in either the serum half-life of GH or in the half-duration of GH secretory bursts during androgen receptor blockade. We speculate that the augmentation of GH secretion observed during antagonism of androgen action in late pubertal males is a result of increased stimulation of estrogen receptor-mediated pathways. Alternatively, androgens may exert a tonic inhibition of GH secretion which can be abolished by androgen receptor blockade.", 
    "18": "Endothelin-1 contracts vascular smooth muscle and inhibits release of neurotransmitter from adrenergic and cholinergic neurons. Experiments were designed to investigate the interaction of these mechanisms in a blood vessel that receives both adrenergic and cholinergic innervation. Rings cut from canine left anterior descending coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers for the measurement of isometric force. In some rings, the endothelium was removed. Endothelin-1 caused concentration-dependent increases in tension in all rings. During electrical stimulation (1 Hz, 9 V, 2 msec), the contractions to endothelin-1 were reduced significantly. In rings without endothelium, this decrease was greater in the presence of atropine (10(-6) M) and was eliminated by a combination of phentolamine (10(-5) M) and propranolol (5 x 10(-6) M). Contractions to endothelin-1 during electrical stimulation in rings with endothelium were significantly less than those without endothelium. This difference was eliminated by atropine and NG-monomethyl L-arginine (10(-4) M). The presynaptic effects of endothelin-1 were studied by measurement of tritium-labeled norepinephrine. Phasic electrical stimulation induced release of norepinephrine; this was inhibited by endothelin-1 at high concentrations (4 x 10(-7) M) in the presence of atropine. These results suggest that the major effect of endothelin-1 is postsynaptic in canine coronary arteries. However, contractions to endothelin-1 may be modulated by the level of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. In situations in which innervation to the coronary arteries is altered, for example, in hearts used for transplantation, the contractile effects of endothelin-1 would prevail.",

A temporary accreditation was granted by the International Olympic Committee to the accredited laboratory of Barcelona (Spain) to set up a Doping Control Laboratory in Havana. Two other laboratories from Mexico and Cuba contributed personnel, materials, and instrumentation. The main issues associated with the preparation and organization of the project are described. During 16 days, 741 urine samples were tested for stimulants, narcotics, anabolic steroids, beta-blockers, diuretics, cannabinoids, local anesthetics, and human chorionic gonadotropin by gas-liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, high-performance liquid chromatography, and immunoassay techniques. Analytical methodologies, quality-control strategies, and the main results are reported.", 
    "20": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) subclass phenotype B, characterized by a predominance of small LDL as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis, has been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and an atherogenic lipoprotein profile. Previous studies employing complex segregation analysis have demonstrated a major, single gene effect on the inheritance of this phenotype in families. Recently, linkage between this phenotype and variation at the LDL receptor locus on chromosome 19 has been reported. However, variation in LDL subclass phenotypes has also been associated with age, gender, diabetes status, beta-blocker medication, and diet. The present study further evaluates the relative importance of genetic and nongenetic influences on LDL subclass phenotypes and on LDL peak particle diameter (as a reflection of the size of the major LDL subclass) in monozygotic and dizygotic women twin pairs. The analysis is based on 203 monozygotic and 145 dizygotic pairs of adult female twins who participated in the second examination of the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study. The average age was 51 years at this exam and 90% were white. Concordance analysis revealed that monozygotic cotwins shared LDL subclass phenotypes more frequently than dizygotic cotwins, and this was confirmed using logistic regression analysis after controlling for potential confounding factors. Heritability analyses suggested that approximately one third to one half of the variation in LDL peak particle diameter, a continuous variable reflecting LDL size, could be attributed to genetic influences. Commingling analysis of the frequency distribution of LDL peak particle diameter identified three distinct subgroups of subjects, one of which corresponded to those subjects with LDL subclass phenotype B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "In paired experiments, we exercised sheep at a constant rate of 4 mph on a treadmill and measured the hemodynamic effects of alpha receptor blockade (phentolamine 5 mg intravenously), beta receptor blockade (propranolol 1 mg intravenously), and combined alpha and beta receptor blockade. Beta blockade increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) at rest and during steady-state exercise compared with control runs. PVR decreased slightly at rest with alpha blockade, but it was not different during exercise from that of control runs. Combined alpha and beta blockade restored PVR to that of control runs, showing that the vasoconstrictor effect of beta blockade was due to unopposed alpha receptor activation. In all sheep an early rapid decrease in PVR within the first 20 s of the onset of exercise was followed by a smaller, slower change over the next 40 to 240 s. The early decrease in PVR was unaffected by either alpha or beta receptor blockade, suggesting that it was due to recruitment of nonmuscular microvessels. We conclude that alpha and beta receptor activation occurs during exercise but that the net vasoactive effect is neutral. The changes in PVR during normal exercise are a combination of rapid recruitment of microvessels followed by slower vasodilation of resistance vessels.", 
    "22": "Intraoperative myocardial ischemia is associated with an increased risk of a perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. If reversible physiologic variables could be identified that are indicators of myocardial ischemia, treatment might be instituted early to prevent cardiac morbidity. In patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery, we evaluated the relationship between several premorbid patient characteristics, selected hemodynamic variables, intraoperative myocardial ischemia, and a PMI. In addition we evaluated these selected hemodynamic variables as intraoperative indicators of myocardial ischemia. The following variables were evaluated: heart rate, > 80 beats/min; systolic arterial blood pressure, > 160 mm Hg; systolic arterial blood pressure, < 80 mm Hg; mean arterial blood pressure, < 60 mm Hg; pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, > 18 mm Hg; a 5 mm Hg increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure; rate pressure product, > 12,000 beats/min.mm Hg; and a pressure rate quotient, < 1.0 mm Hg/beats/min. The premorbid patient characteristics selected were previous myocardial infarction, recent myocardial infarction (within 1 wk of surgery), type and number of coronary lesions, beta-blocker therapy, and calcium blocker therapy. One hundred consecutive (n = 100) patients for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were studied prospectively before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Patients were monitored with a Hewlett Packard computer ST segment analyzer using leads II and V5. Ischemia was defined as the new onset of ST segment deviation of > or = 1 mm from the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) (preinduction) for at least 2 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "A case of silent thyroiditis after unilateral adrenalectomy for treatment of Cushing's syndrome is reported. The left adrenocortical adenoma was resected. Glucocorticoid was replaced after the operation and was gradually tapered. Thyrotoxic symptoms with painless goiter occurred 9 months after the adrenalectomy when a replacement dose of prednisolone was tapered to 5 mg/d. Plasma-free thyroid hormones increased and thyrotropin was suppressed. Thyroidal uptake of radioactive iodine was extremely low. Both titers of antimicrosomal and antithyroglobulin antibodies stayed at high levels throughout the observation period from the preoperative stage. Normalization of thyroid functions was obtained 3 months after the onset of thyrotoxicosis with beta-adrenergic blocker alone. It was speculated that exposure to a large amount of endogenous and supplementary exogenous glucocorticoid protected the patient's immune system from autoimmune attack of thyroid antigens and that tapering of the supplementary glucocorticoid caused exacerbation of immune responses, resulting in overt thyroid dysfunction even 9 months after adrenalectomy.", 
    "24": "After i.v. administration of racemic metoprolol in the rat, the plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-metoprolol were comparable, and no differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between the two enantiomers were found. From the 3rd to the 12th month, comparable changes were seen for both enantiomers: there was an increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and a decrease in blood and plasma clearance. Half-life showed a significant prolongation, volume of distribution decreased between 3 and 12 months and increased between 12 and 24 months. After oral administration of the racemate, AUC and Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) were slightly higher, while oral clearance was slightly lower for (R)-metoprolol than for (S)-metoprolol. With aging, Cmax and AUC increased for both enantiomers, while oral clearance decreased. The change in oral clearance as a function of age is different between (S)- and (R)-metoprolol, and thus enantioselective. In vitro disappearance rate in 3-month-old rats was significantly higher for (S)-metoprolol than for (R)-metoprolol, although the difference was small. With aging, the disappearance rates of both enantiomers increased significantly, but not enantioselectively.",

    "27": "The median follow-up was 29 months. Twenty-six patients dropped out (13 in the isosorbide group) because of poor compliance or complications unrelated to treatment. Eighteen patients died (9 in the isosorbide-treated group), 6 due to bleeding. The 1- and 2-year actuarial percentages of patients free of bleeding was 90.8% and 82.2% in the isosorbide-5-mononitrate--and 93.9% and 85.8% in the propranolol-treated groups, respectively (P = NS).

    "29": "Neuropeptide Y is distributed abundantly not only in the brain, but also in the gastrointestinal tract and suppresses intestinal muscle contraction in isolated muscle preparations. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether centrally administered neuropeptide Y modulated gastric emptying and intestinal transit in conscious rats. Graded doses of neuropeptide Y were administered intracisternally 1 min before ingestion of test meals through an oral tube. Four hours after ingestion of 60 Amberlite pellets, the rats were sacrificed and residual pellets in the stomach and the small intestine segments were counted to calculate the solid meal transit rate. The liquid meal transit rate was calculated 1 hr after 0.07% phenol red ingestion by determining the residual phenol red in the stomach and the small intestine segments. Neuropeptide Y elicited potent suppression of gastric emptying and intestinal transit of both solid and liquid meals. Pretreatment with propranolol antagonized, whereas phentolamine did not affect, the suppressive effect of central neuropeptide Y. Although carbachol blocked the effects of neuropeptide Y, neither atropine nor hexamethonium altered the actions of neuropeptide Y. In conclusion, centrally administered neuropeptide Y strongly inhibited gastrointestinal transit by stimulating a beta-adrenergic pathway.", 
    "30": "In all patients who received streptokinase infusion for strongly suspected acute myocardial infarction in 1 hospital during 1989 to 1990, the occurrence of hypotension during infusion is described and related to prognosis. In 54% of patients, the beta blocker metoprolol was simultaneously administered intravenously. The median systolic blood pressure (BP) before infusion was 135 mm Hg, and the median value for the lowest systolic BP recorded during infusion was 100 mm Hg (p < 0.001). A positive correlation between systolic BP before streptokinase and the lowest systolic BP during infusion was found (r = 0.53; p < 0.001). Among patients administered streptokinase and metoprolol, 23% had systolic BP < 90 mm Hg, and 12% had < 80 mm Hg at any time during infusion; corresponding values for patients administered streptokinase only were 47 and 30%, respectively. Patients with the lowest systolic BP < 80 mm Hg during infusion had a mortality during the first 2 weeks of 22 vs 11% for those with between 80 and 100 mm Hg, and 8% for those with > 100 mm Hg (p < 0.001). However, in a multivariate analysis the systolic BP before infusion rather than the lowest systolic BP during infusion was independently associated with death. It is concluded that although patients with low systolic BP during streptokinase infusion have a high mortality, the level of systolic BP before infusion is more strongly associated with the outcome. Simultaneous use of intravenous beta blockade does not increase the occurrence of hypotension during streptokinase infusion.", 
    "31": "Elevation of noradrenaline level in the brain cortex of 7-day old rats induced by prenatal corticosterone administration was accompanied by a decrease in beta-adrenoreceptor density determined by specific [3H]dihydroxyalprenolol binding. Affinity of receptors to the ligand remained unchanged. Injections to 4-6-day old rats of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine that blocks catecholamine synthesis resulted in a decreased noradrenaline content and increased beta-adrenoreceptor density in the brain cortex of 7-day old rats. The extent of changes in beta-adrenoreceptor density in the brain cortex of 7-day old rats induced by prenatal or postnatal treatment showed negative correlation with changes in noradrenaline level. Thus, noradrenaline down-regulates beta-adrenoreceptor density in the brain cortex during early postnatal development. Such effect of the neurotransmitter can mediate the effect of corticosterone on ontogenesis of beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "32": "Aging significantly affects reflex cardiovascular (CV) responses to induced muscular contraction in anesthetized dogs. To further investigate whether age-related changes in beta-adrenergic responsiveness contribute to these previously reported changes in reflex CV responses associated with advanced age, hemodynamic and regional blood flow (BF) responses to static hindlimb contraction (HLC) were evaluated during alpha-chloralose anesthesia before and after beta-adrenergic blockade (AB) in younger (2-3 years) and older (8-14 years) beagles. AB with propranolol resulted in significant (P < or = 0.05) reductions in cardiac output, heart rate and mean arterial pressure at baseline, regardless of age. However, baseline stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance were only changed by AB in the older dogs. During HLC, AB had a similar effect (or lack of effect) on each of the five hemodynamic responses evaluated in both age groups. AB did not significantly change baseline BF (microspheres) to any of the individual abdominal organs evaluated in the younger dogs, but resulted in a reduction in baseline BF to five of eight abdominal organs in the older dogs. By contrast, AB resulted in attenuated, rather than accentuated, BF reductions during HLC to six of eight abdominal organs in the younger dogs but in only one of eight abdominal organs in the older dogs. Likewise, the combined BF reduction to all eight abdominal regions during HLC was attenuated only in the younger dogs, probably reflecting age-related changes in reflex sympathetic nerve responses to HLC rather than the effects of age on beta-adrenergic mediated CV responses. Baseline BF was reduced in three of eight muscles after AB only in the older beagles. However, the BF response to three of four contracting muscles was unchanged after AB, regardless of age. These results demonstrate that baseline differences in the level of beta-adrenergic stimulation and/or function in younger and older dogs are generally not associated with age-related differences in CV responses to HLC initiated in contracting muscles and mediated by reflex beta-adrenergic CV stimulation.", 
    "33": "The aim was to examine differences in the vascular response to alpha adrenoceptor stimulation on both smooth muscle and endothelium among large arteries perfusing various organs.", 
    "34": "In ring preparations of coronary, carotid, iliac, mesenteric, and renal arteries from pigs (n = 24), the magnitudes of contraction to noradrenaline (with beta blocker), with or without endothelium, and endothelium dependent relaxation to noradrenaline (with alpha 1 and beta blocker) were compared in vitro.", 
    "35": "In both endothelium-intact and denuded groups, the contractions to noradrenaline were significantly smaller in coronary and carotid arteries than in iliac, mesenteric, and renal arteries. The presence of endothelium significantly suppressed the contractions in coronary and carotid arteries, but did not affect the contractions in iliac, mesenteric, and renal arteries. The endothelium dependent relaxations to noradrenaline, which were abolished by LNMMA, were more prominent in coronary and carotid arteries than in iliac, mesenteric, and renal arteries.", 
    "36": "The contractions via alpha adrenoceptors were small, and endothelium dependent relaxations via alpha 2 adrenoceptors were large, in the coronary and carotid arteries, which perfuse the vital organs (heart and brain), as compared with those in iliac, mesenteric, and renal arteries. These results suggest that in the state of activation of the sympathetic nervous system, arterial tone in response to alpha adrenoceptor stimulation may be regulated not only by alpha adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle but also by those on endothelium, through release of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF) via alpha 2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "37": "Contact autoradiography of tissue sections, using emulsion coated coverslips or X-ray films, is widely used to provide information about the regional distribution of receptors. This easy to perform, standard technique has the disadvantage of an image spread due to the gap between the radioactive source and the film. The present study describes a new technique which combines photoaffinity labeling of beta-adrenoceptors with \"dipping\" autoradiography and a modified trichrome stain. Incubation of 16 microns cryosections of rat lung tissue with the iodinated, photoaffinity labeling, non-selective, beta-adrenergic agonist [125I]-cyanopindololazide II ([125I]-CYPA II) (100 pmol/l) in the absence or presence of 1 mumol (+/-)-propranolol revealed strong, specific beta-adrenoceptor binding to alveolar parenchyma and bronchial epithelium of large and small bronchioles, lesser binding to smooth muscle bundles of large airways and only sparse binding to the smooth muscle of small bronchioles or peripheral branches of pulmonary artery. With standard autoradiographic techniques, a similar distribution of the label was obtained, although resolution and sensitivity were inferior. Staining of tissue sections through the photoemulsion by means of a modified Mallory's trichrome dye facilitated the discrimination between alveolar and bronchial epithelium, muscular and collagenous tissues. In conclusion, the photoaffinity labeling of beta-adrenoceptors with [125I]-CYPA II allows the use of \"dipping\" autoradiography. This technique, in combination with trichrome staining through the photoemulsion, results in an improved autoradiographic image together with a better association of the label with distinct histological structures and the higher sensitivity of the method.", 
    "38": "We have used a reverse hemolytic plaque assay and frequency distribution of immunoplaque areas to analyze the effect of carbachol (CCh, 100 nM), on insulin secretion by single pancreatic beta-cells. The CCh effect was strongly dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration. Compared with the respective controls in each condition, when glucose was omitted from the incubation medium, CCh induced a 85% increase in the insulin secretion index. In 5.6 mM glucose, CCh induced a 100% increase in the insulin secretion index and this effect was characterized by (1) amplification of the response to glucose, and (2) recruitment of previously silent cells to secretory activity. However, at high glucose concentrations (20.6 mM), the insulin secretion index decreased 49%. CCh effects were blocked by atropine (1 microM). CCh effects were not uniform among beta-cells. The functional subpopulation of beta-cells with the highest secretion rate was preferentially affected by the muscarinic agonist. The specific sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin prevented CCh-stimulated insulin secretion in basal media, suggesting that voltage-dependent sodium channels are involved in CCh stimulation-secretion coupling in single beta-cells.", 
    "39": "We investigated the role of beta-adrenoceptors at postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings in noradrenaline release in rabbits with cardiomyopathic congestive heart failure produced by adriamycin (1 mg/kg, I.V., twice a week for 8 weeks). Plasma noradrenaline levels were measured before, 30 min after, and 60 min after the start of continuous intravenous administration of adrenaline (0.06 micrograms/kg/min) in adriamycin-treated and vehicle-treated rabbits in anesthetized condition and pithed condition with electrically stimulated sympathetic outflow (3 Hz, 1 ms square wave pulse, 90 V). In both the anesthetized and pithed conditions, adrenaline increased plasma noradrenaline levels in vehicle-treated rabbits. However, in the adriamycin-treated rabbits, adrenaline had no effect on the plasma noradrenaline level. Pretreatment with propranolol (0.2 mg/kg, bolus I.V. + 0.1 mg/kg/hr, continuous infusion) almost completely abolished the rise in plasma noradrenaline associated with adrenaline infusion in vehicle-treated rabbits. These results suggest that in rabbits with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, the noradrenaline release from the sympathetic nerve endings via the activation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors is reduced. This might be due to down-regulation of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors caused by the elevated plasma noradrenaline due to cardiac failure. However, other possibilities such as reduced affinity or impaired signal transduction cannot be excluded.", 
    "40": "The U937 monocytic cell line and its differentiated macrophage-like form have been well characterized, illustrating many similarities with their analogous in vivo cells. We examined the release of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) from undifferentiated and differentiated cells after stimulation with opsonized zymosan and investigated whether the release of this mediator could be modified by isoprenaline. After stimulation, the U937 cells released TXB2 in a dose-dependent manner, with the release greater from the differentiated cells. The TXB2 released was inhibited by flurbiprofen (> 10(-8) M; P < .01) and isoprenaline (> 10(-6) M; P < .01), and the inhibition was reversed by propranolol (10(-6) M; P < .02). Thus, it is clear that undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells release TXB2, which can be inhibited by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. These findings illustrate an important functional difference between the in vivo macrophages and differentiated U937 cells because beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation does not inhibit mediator release from macrophages.", 
    "41": "Regulation of plasma membrane ion transport by endogenous purinergic receptors was assessed in a distal renal (A6) cell line. Nucleotide analogues stimulated Na-K-Cl cotransport activity with relative potencies of ATP > UTP > ATP gamma S > 2-methylthio-ATP = alpha,beta-methylene ATP. Activation of nucleotide receptors with extracellular ATP and nucleotide analogues increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) primarily by release of intracellular calcium stores, with relative potency of agonists similar to that seen for stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport. Neither the change in [Ca2+]i nor the stimulation of cotransport was abolished by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-(4-[N-(2-aminoethyl)carbamoylmethoxy]-phenyl)-1,3-dipropylxanthi ne (XAC). In contrast to the adenosine A2 receptor agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, nucleotide analogues had no discernible effect on cytosolic adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels or adenylyl cyclase activity. To address possible mechanisms for stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport by the nucleotide receptor, 125I efflux and patch-clamp studies were used to measure chloride secretion. ATP and ionomycin markedly enhanced 125I efflux and whole cell currents, consistent with activation of chloride conductance pathways. Diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, a chloride channel blocker, eliminated the effects of ionomycin, forskolin, adenosine, and ATP on Na-K-Cl cotransport. This study demonstrates that nucleotide receptors in this model of renal epithelium initiate distinct regulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport. Nucleotide receptors may effect their responses through primary activation of membrane chloride channels.", 
    "42": "Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that enteric inhibitory neurotransmission in pyloric muscles is mediated by NO. Junction potentials were recorded with intracellular microelectrodes from cells near the myenteric and submucosal surfaces of the circular muscle layer. Inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) were apamin sensitive and were reduced by arginine analogues [NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)]. The effects of arginine analogues were reversed by L-arginine. Inhibition of IJPs unmasked excitatory JPs (EJPs) in the myenteric region and increased excitability of cells in the submucosal region. IJPs were also reduced by oxyhemoglobin. As with arginine analogues, reduction in IJPs increased EJP amplitude. Combination of L-NAME and oxyhemoglobin completely blocked IJPs, suggesting that NO, or an NO-containing compound, mediated the enteric inhibitory nerve responses. Exogenous NO hyperpolarized membrane potential, and these responses were also reduced by apamin. The magnitude of the responses to a given dose of NO was similar in cells of the myenteric and submucosal regions, suggesting that relatively smaller IJPs in submucosal cells may be due to a lower density of enteric inhibitory innervation in the submucosal region. The effects of NO were mimicked by 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) and M & B 22948, a specific cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, suggesting that the hyperpolarization response to NO may be mediated by enhanced production of cGMP. IJPs were also prolonged by M & B 22948. IJPs and NO disrupted normal electrical rhythmicity in cells in the myenteric region. This may provide a basis for inhibitory effects of enteric inhibitory nerve stimulation on sphincter pressure in pyloric canal in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The effect of thyroxine on the response of urinary bladder strips to autonomic drugs and electrical stimulation was studied. Bladder strips from euthyroid, hyperthyroid and thyroidectomized rats were used. Rats were made hyperthyroid by intramuscular injection of thyroxine (250 micrograms/rat for 5 days). Surgical thyroidectomy was performed 12-15 weeks before the experiment. The contractile response of bladder strips from each of the 3 groups of rats to electrical field stimulation and the following drugs was measured: isoproterenol; bethanechol; methoxamine; adenosine triphosphate, and potassium chloride. Isoproterenol produced a significantly greater relaxation in strips from hyperthyroid than from euthyroid rats. The enhanced relaxation response to isoproterenol was accompanied by an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor density. The contractile response to methoxamine, adenosine triphosphate and potassium chloride was unchanged by pretreating the rats with thyroxine. The increase in contraction produced by bethanechol was the same in strips from hyperthyroid and euthyroid rats and the muscarinic receptor densities were also unaltered by thyroxine. Bladder strips from thyroidectomized rats showed the same response as strips from control animals following electrical field stimulation or exposure to isoproterenol, bethanechol, methoxamine, adenosine triphosphate and potassium chloride. These results demonstrate that thyroxine pretreatment enhances the relaxation of urinary bladder strips produced by isoproterenol and that this response is correlated with a hormone-induced increase in beta-adrenergic receptors in this tissue.", 
    "44": "The role of alpha-2 adrenoceptors in lipid mobilization and blood flow was investigated in situ using microdialysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue in nonobese healthy subjects. The alpha-2 agonist clonidine caused dose-dependent biphasic response with increased glycerol levels at low clonidine concentrations and decreased glycerol levels at concentrations > 10(-7) mol/liter. Similar results were observed with epinephrine plus propranolol. Clonidine action was unaffected in the presence of labetalol (beta-/alpha-1 antagonist) but completely blunted by the presence of yohimbine (alpha-2 antagonist). The pseudolipolytic effect of clonidine was significantly more pronounced in gluteal as compared with abdominal adipose tissue. When clonidine was added together with the vasodilating agents nitroprusside or hydralazine, the pseudolipolytic effect was abolished and a dose-dependent decrease in dialysate glycerol was observed at all clonidine concentrations (10(-10)-10(-4) mol/liter). When ethanol was added to the perfusate to monitor blood flow, the escape of alcohol from the dialysate was accelerated by 30% with hydralazine or nitroprusside (P < 0.01) and 30% retarded (P < 0.05) by clonidine (10(-10) mol/liter). Thus, the results demonstrate an important role of blood flow for regulating lipid mobilization from adipose tissue in vivo. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation causes marked retention of lipids in adipose tissue due to vasoconstriction in combination with antilipoiysis.",

All studies were performed during normoxia.", 
    "49": "Heart rate (HR) increased with increasing infusion rates of dopexamine and systemic arterial pressure and vascular resistance decreased. Cardiac index, left ventricular pressure development, and systemic VO2 were unchanged, as was the rate x pressure product. Left circumflex coronary artery blood flow and myocardial VO2 were unaltered. After beta 1-blockade, dopexamine produced an increase in HR and decreased systemic arterial pressure and vascular resistance. After beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade, no change was noted in systemic or myocardial VO2, coronary blood flow, or rate x pressure product. After beta 1, beta 2-blockade with propranolol, increasing infusion rates of dopexamine resulted in decreases in systemic pressure and vascular resistance.", 
    "50": "Dopexamine produced significant cardiovascular effects mediated primarily by beta 2-adrenergic receptors, and also produced residual peripheral arterial vasodilation after combined beta 1- and beta 2-blockade. The latter finding suggests that dopaminergic receptor stimulation may partly mediate dopexamine's effects in newborn lambs.", 
    "51": "We investigated the effect of the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol on the beta-adrenergic receptor density of circulating lymphocytes in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Nine men in New York Heart Association functional classes II (six patients) and III were given metoprolol for 6 months (mean dose 45.6 +/- 18.1 mg). Their cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography. Although there was no difference in the heart rate or pressure rate products, the end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions significantly decreased in six patients after metoprolol treatment. The ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and mean left ventricular circumferential shortening were significantly increased after the treatment. beta-Adrenoceptor densities of lymphocytes, examined by iodine 125-labeled iodocyanopindolol, were reduced in patients at entry but recovered to normal levels after the metoprolol treatment. The dissociation constants did not differ at any stage of the disease. The relationship between beta-adrenoceptor densities in lymphocytes and echocardiographic parameters showed a positive correlation with the plasma norepinephrine concentration. This study thus provides evidence that long-term metoprolol therapy for dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with beta-receptor up-regulation, and the restoration of myocardial beta-receptor density may be associated with the improved cardiac function as determined by echocardiography.", 
    "52": "The mechanisms underlying the glucose dependence of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated insulin secretion were examined in a hamster insulin-secreting cell line (HIT cells). At 1.67 mM glucose, 100 nM AVP stimulated biphasic changes in free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and insulin secretion. The initial spike of [Ca2+]i came from an intracellular pool and was accompanied by parallel changes in the levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The following sustained increase in [Ca2+]i was associated with membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The rapid phase of insulin secretion and the [Ca2+]i spike were resistant to the Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine, whereas the sustained insulin secretion and the protracted increase in [Ca2+]i were inhibited by nimodipine. Thus, biphasic increases in [Ca2+]i mediated the biphasic insulin secretory pattern. In the absence of glucose, 100 nM AVP triggered a transient smaller spike in [Ca2+]i, but did not stimulate membrane depolarization, Ca2+ influx, or insulin secretion. However, the increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was similar to that seen at 1.67 mM glucose. Both the AVP-induced [Ca2+]i spike and sustained [Ca2+]i increase were augmented by glucose. We concluded that the initial AVP receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase-C is not altered by glucose, but both intracellular Ca2+ release and extracellular Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels triggered by AVP are glucose dependent and explain the sensitivity of AVP-stimulated insulin release to this metabolite.", 
    "53": "The effect of gastric surgery on the absorption of a basic drug propranolol was studied in 11 patients. 80 mg of propranolol were administered orally before and after surgery. Irrespective of the surgical technique, there was only a significant decrease in the absorption constant Ka (1.10 +/- 0.14 vs 0.72 +/- 0.09) (p < 0.05), indicating a delay in the gastrointestinal absorption, which agreed with the delay in the urine excretion in the first six hours after surgery (6.8 +/- 0.8 vs 1.7 +/- 0.4) (p < 0.001). Patients with vagotomy but without gastric resection showed a significant increase in the time of attainment of peak concentration tmax (2.4 +/- 0.2 vs 3.2 +/- 0.3), and decrease in Ka (1.5 +/- 0.12 vs 0.73 +/- 0.17) (p < 0.05), indicating also a delay in the gastrointestinal absorption, that is not seen in patients with partial gastric resection. We conclude that vagotomy with gastric resection does not modify the absorption of propranolol, and vagotomy without resection delays its absorption but does not decrease it.", 
    "54": "The in vitro effect of nifedipine and atenolol, either alone or in combination, on the proliferation and migration of rat aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated. Nifedipine inhibited the replication of arterial myocytes in concentrations ranging between 10 and 100 microM. The inhibition, evaluated as cell number, was dose- and time-dependent with an IC50 of 39 and 34 microM after 48 and 72 h, respectively; the cell doubling time increased with drug concentrations up to 118 h versus 28 h for controls. Atenolol alone failed to reduce arterial myocyte proliferation, and did not influence the effect of nifedipine on cell proliferation. Nifedipine and atenolol alone inhibited in a dose-dependent manner rat aortic myocytes migration induced by fibrinogen as chemotactic agent. When the combination nifedipine-atenolol was investigated, an additive inhibitory effect on cell migration was observed. These results provide in vitro support for a potential effect of this drug association on early steps of atherogenesis.",

The duration of a left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential (APD) was measured during atrial pacing at 7-10 cycle lengths (CL). The APD/CL relation was fitted to a hyperbolic function: APD = CL/[(axCL)+b].

When cardiovascular responses were elicited, either tachycardia or bradycardia was induced, depending on the locus investigated. When tachycardia occurred, atrial and/or ventricular forces were augmented. When bradycardia occurred, atrial forces were suppressed. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in two animals when ventricular ganglionated plexus loci were investigated. Cardiovascular responses were not elicited when up to 2000 micrograms of nicotine were administered adjacent to intrinsic cardiac axons, indicating that responses were not primarily due to axonal effects. Control injections of saline (0.1 ml) into active loci did not elicit cardiovascular responses. Following acute decentralisation, responses initiated by nicotine were attenuated or eliminated. Depressor responses were no longer elicited following atropine administration, nor augmentor ones following propranolol administration.",

    "63": "Solid dispersions were prepared by the evaporation of ethanol after dissolving into ethanol a water soluble medicine (oxprenolol hydrochloride (OXP)), four grades of water insoluble ethylcellulose (EC) and four grades of water soluble hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), both having different molecular weights. The precise control of the release rat of a water soluble medicine by applying the difference in the molecular weight of polymers was attempted. The pore size distribution in solid dispersion granules was measured before and after the dissolution test by mercury intrusion porosimetry to clarify the mechanism of medicine release from the granules when the molecular weights of polymers were different. The state of medicine in the solid dispersions was analyzed by thermal analysis and X-ray diffractometry. Although the difference was slight, the release rate of OXP from the granules of the OXP-HPC system decreased as the molecular weight of HPC increased. The release behavior of OXP in the OXP-EC system was scarcely affected by the molecular weight of EC. However, in the OXP-EC-HPC system, the release rate markedly decreased with a larger molecular weight of EC. It was thought from the results of the pore size distribution that there were two types of release routes for OXP; dissolving directly into the dissolution medium and diffusing in the swelled HPC phase, caused by the addition of HPC. The decrease in the release rate of OXP in the OXP-EC-HPC system was caused by the increase in the ratio of OXP dissolving via the latter route, occurring with a larger molecular weight of EC. These results suggest that it is feasible to precisely control the release of a water soluble medicine by varying the molecular weight of the polymers in the solid dispersion.", 
    "64": "In the conscious dog, intravenous administration of methionine-enkephalin produces simultaneous increases in both heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). This report describes both depressor and cardioaccelerator responses to methionine-enkephalin (10 micrograms/kg IV) in conscious dogs following acute hypotension induced by either bolus injection of isoproterenol (0.1-5.0 micrograms/kg IV) or infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 3-8 micrograms/kg/min). Cardiovascular responses to methionine-enkephalin were blocked by naloxone. Pretreatment of the dogs with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol failed to prevent the hypotensive response to methionine-enkephalin following SNP infusion. The results indicate that the hemodynamic responses to methionine-enkephalin can be altered by acute manipulation of blood pressure. These results may have implications relative to the role of endogenous opiates in regulation of blood pressure, especially in acute hypotensive states.",

The patient was supported with atropine, isoproterenol, dopamine, and dobutamine, and a thorough pharmacokinetic monitoring of atenolol was conducted. As the serum creatinine concentration returned slowly to baseline with good diuresis, the concentration of atenolol decreased (biologic half-life = 2.95 days) and the blood pressure gradually recovered. The patient improved and was subsequently discharged in good health. Had pharmacokinetic monitoring of atenolol not been performed, hemodialysis would have been indicated.",

Patients with well-controlled hypertension already prescribed 50 mg of atenolol (with or without the addition of a diuretic) for control of hypertension were selected for participation from the outpatient hypertension clinic of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Seated blood pressure (BP) and pulse were obtained during the baseline phase and during the randomized treatment phase. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was performed once during the baseline phase and once during the randomized treatment phase, near the end of each 4-week period.

There was a slight increase in pulse (average = 5.2 beats/minute; P = .02) for those participants treated with metoprolol. For within-treatment groups, the ambulatory BP data showed no significant differences in systolic and diastolic BPs, except for an increase in morning diastolic BP for those randomized to metoprolol (average = 6.2 mm Hg; P = .01).

    "67": "We evaluated the frequency dependence of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) release from the parasympathetic nerves to the canine heart. In intact animals in the presence of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (propranolol, 0.5 mg/kg), the cervical vagosympathetic trunks were stimulated at various frequencies before and after the administration of atropine (0.1 mg/kg). The stimulations before atropine produced a classical bradycardia that progressed to cardiac arrest when the stimulation frequency was raised above 10 to 15 Hz. After atropine, vagal stimulation at various frequencies increased heart rate. The heart rate reached a maximum increase of 21 +/- 3 beats per min at a stimulation frequency of 20 Hz. In an isolated atrial preparation in which the VIP outflow was measured, the tachycardia elicited after atropine had a frequency dependence similar to that obtained in vivo. The peak increase of 23 +/- 3% above the basal rate (95 +/- 8 beats per min) occurred at a stimulation frequency of 20 Hz. The VIP outflow paralleled the tachycardia response (r = 0.95); the maximum outflow of VIP was 172 +/- 54 pg/(min . 100 g wet wt) and was evoked at a stimulation frequency of 20 Hz. This suggests that the vagally induced tachycardia is mediated, at least partly, by VIP.", 
    "68": "The effects of a stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors by using (+/-)SKF 38393 on the cortical EEG in rats which were chronically implanted with electrodes were studied. Administration of SKF 38393 (3 or 9 mg/kg, s.c.) produced alterations suggesting an arousal in the EEG: the power in all of the frequency bands decreased to a level of 70-80% of baseline activity, which effect was dose- and time-dependent. In behaviour, episodes of intensive grooming (face-washing) alternated with those of lack of spontaneous motility and occasionally chewing movements were noted. In contrast, apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a selective increase in power in the alpha 1 band, accompanied by stereotyped sniffing and licking. The effects of SKF 38393 (9 mg/kg) were completely blocked by pretreatment with the selective antagonist at D1 dopamine receptors, SCH 23390 (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.). The application of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), which is mainly a D2 blocker, failed to influence the alterations induced by SKF 38393 (9 kg/kg, s.c.). In a further experimental group, the effects produced by stimulation of D1 receptors (SKF 38393 9 mg/kg), followed by activation of putative dopamine autoreceptors by a small dose of apomorphine (0.05 mg.kg, s.c.) were studied: in this case, the effects of SKF 38393 were abolished and typical effects of small doses of apomorphine were manifest, such as hypokinesia and sedation, accompanied by large increases of power in all of the frequency bands, except beta 2. The results suggest that stimulation of D1 receptors produces some desynchronization in the EEG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Clinical procedures for the treatment of high myopia are updated in this third part of a report on high myopia. After a discussion of testing techniques and refractive approaches for high myopia, an examination of therapeutic drug experiences shows their relative merits. The author believes that more investigation of beta blocker and epinephrine topical solutions is needed pertaining to the treatment of high myopia. Theoretically, such agents could improve deficient arterial perfusion of the highly myopic eye, and could be helpful in retarding scleral creep. Lifestyle recommendations include patient advice on accommodative reduction and proper exercise techniques. Low impact aerobics may have merit for highly myopic patients since the improved cardiovascular efficiency they can provide may improve the deficient arterial perfusion of their retinas. A summary of the three-part report on high myopia concludes the article. The physiological patterns of high myopia dovetail into the biomechanical considerations showing that a scleral pathogenesis hypothesis of myopic development is a viable working theory. The author's clinical procedures reflect the influence of that theory. If research were redirected from deprivation studies to investigating biomechanical considerations and pharmacological approaches to high myopia, the author contends that dramatically improved treatment regimens could result.", 
    "70": "To evaluate the effect of different bicycle exercise programmes on estimates of functional capacity in cardiac patients, the cumulated exercise capacity, physiologic and gas exchange responses were measured in eleven men 5-10 weeks after an acute myocardial infarction. The patients were not limited by angina and all were treated with a beta-blocker. On separate days and in randomized order the patients performed symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise testing on 50 W/3 min stage, 50 W/6 min stage and continuous 'ramp' (15 W per min) programmes. Submaximal and peak oxygen consumption, peak heart rate, rate pressure product, workload and minute ventilation were independent of the various exercise programmes, but exercise time and maximal cumulated exercise capacity (workload x time integral) were significantly higher on the 50 W/6 min stage (50.3 +/- 20.0 kJ) and ramp (41.1 +/- 16.4 kJ) programmes compared to the 50 W/3 min stage programme (32.8 +/- 11.9 kJ). The variation of exercise time and cumulated work capacity, but not oxygen consumption between different exercise programmes has to be considered when estimating functional capacity early after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "71": "Sixty patients with Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) of 100-110mmHg matched for age, sex and Bp levels were randomly assigned to propranolol 80mg daily or Hydroflumethiazide (HFM) 50mg daily. HFM causes a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and DBP within 4 weeks compared both with baseline and propranolol (SBP 143.7 +/- 12.3 vs 158.1 +/- 10.9mmHg, P < 0.05; DBP 92.0 +/- 4.5 vs 102.4 +/- 5.1mmHg, P < 0.05), (SBP 143.7 +/- 12.2 vs 152 +/- 11.0mmHg P < 0.05; DBP 92.0 +/- 4.5 vs 101.1 +/- 6.1mmHg, P < 0.05), respectively. Propranolol produced no significant difference from the baseline at 4 weeks (SBP 152.0 +/- H.0 vs 154.1 +/- 11.5mmHg NS; DBP 101.1 +/- 6.1 vs 102.2 +/- 5.6mmHg, NS). Reduction in BP by HFM was maintained after 8 and 12 weeks with further reduction but which did not achieve statistical significance. Increased dose of propranolol (160mg daily) after 4 weeks caused significant reduction in BP by 8 week (SBP 146.8 +/- 11.8 vs 152.0 +/- 11.0mmHg, P < 0.05; DBP 95.9 +/- 4.4 vs 101.1 +/- 6.1mmHg P < 0.05), which was maintained upto 12 weeks. The values however remained higher than in the HFM group. More patients in the HFM group achieved target BP (< 140/90), SBP 53.8% vs 29.6% P < 0.05, DBP 69.2% vs 14.8% P < 0.01. Incidence of side effects was similar and will be discussed. Thiazides are superior to B'blockers as initial monotherapy in black hypertensives.",

    "73": "The influence of (+-)-propranolol and clonidine on stress- and various chemically induced gastric ulcers in rats, together with their influence on various biochemical parameters which affect the development of the induced ulcers, was examined. Pretreatment of rats with (+-)-propranolol (10-100 mg/kg) and with clonidine (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) given orally, significantly reduced indomethacin- (30 mg/kg, orally) and reserpine- (5 mg/kg, i.p.) induced ulcers. In addition, propranolol pretreatment significantly reduced ethanol- and cold-stress-induced ulcers, whereas pretreatment with orally given clonidine significantly enhanced these ulcers. Pretreatment with propranolol significantly increased gastric mucus synthesis and the nonprotein sulfhydryl content and reduced gastric lipid peroxidation without affecting gastric acid secretion. Pretreatment of the animals with clonidine significantly increased gastric mucus secretion and decreased total gastric acidity. It did not affect the gastric nonprotein sulfhydryl content and lipid peroxidation. The drug-induced effects on the experimentally induced ulcers may be related to their induced biochemical alteration in the gastric parameters measured.", 
    "74": "Single and repeated oral doses pharmacokinetic studies of metoprolol sustained-release tablets (Sino-Swed Pharmaceutical Co Ltd) were performed on 12 Chinese healthy subjects in an open randomized crossover manner, using metoprolol tablets from Sweden Astra International Pharmaceutical Co Ltd as control. Drug concentrations in plasma were assayed by gas chromatography-electron-capture detector method. The percent of drug absorbed in vivo at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 h correlated well with the amount of drug released in vitro at corresponding time (P > 0.05). Pharmacokinetic parameters in Chinese after metoprolol tablets were comparable to the reported data in foreigners.", 
    "75": "1. We have examined the effect of picrotoxin on GABA-induced currents in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons. In addition, we used the putative picrotoxin receptor antagonist, alpha-isopropyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone (alpha IMGBL), and the picrotoxin agonist, beta-ethyl-beta-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone (beta EMGBL) to explore the mechanisms of picrotoxin's interaction with the GABA-Cl- receptor-ionophore complex. 2. The picrotoxin block of GABA current was use dependent, suggesting that the site of picrotoxin block is exposed by the conformational change initiated by GABA binding to the receptor. 3. The alkyl-substituted butyrolactone antagonist, alpha IMGBL, selectively blocked the use-dependent mechanism of picrotoxin effect. After the apparent complete inhibition of the use-dependent effect, there was a residual picrotoxin effect that was independent of the time or concentration of GABA application. This indicates that the picrotoxin block of the GABA current is mediated by two different mechanisms. alpha IMGBL influences just one of these mechanisms. 4. The picrotoxin receptor agonist, beta EMGBL, exclusively blocked the GABA current in a use-dependent manner. Consistent with a use-dependent mechanism, the rate of onset of block increased with GABA concentration. Surprisingly, the fraction of GABA current block decreased with increasing GABA concentration. 5. These results suggest that the relationship of picrotoxin and gamma-butyrolactones with the GABA-Cl- receptor-ionophore is quite complex. They are consistent with at least two possible models of agonist-antagonist interactions. Both cases require different antagonist affinities for the various kinetic states of the GABA-Cl- receptor-ionophore. However, there is no need to require that either picrotoxin or beta EMGBL acts as an open channel blocker.", 
    "76": "1. The extent to which parasympathetic vasodilator responses, in the submandibular gland of the cat, depend upon release of nitric oxide related (NO chi) or endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) within the gland has been investigated in anesthetized cats given N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) which specifically blocks the synthesis of EDRF from arginine. 2. Close intra-arterial infusions of L-NAME (> or = 100 mg kg-1) produced a steady and significant rise in mean aortic pressure together with a steady increase in basal submandibular vascular resistance over the next 20-30 min, which persisted thereafter. 3. In cats pretreated with propranolol, to block beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, salivation and vasodilatation in response to stimulation of the chorda-lingual nerve were reduced but not abolished by L-NAME (> or = 100 mg kg-1, I.A.). Subsequent administration of atropine (> or = 1 mg kg-1 I.V.) completely suppressed the secretory response and virtually eliminated the vascular response. 4. In cats pretreated with atropine (> or = 1.0 mg kg-1 I.V.) administration of L-NAME (> or = 100 mg kg-1 I.A.) effectively suppressed the vasodilator response to chorda-lingual stimulation at 2 Hz continuously, or at 20 Hz for 1 s at 10 s intervals. 5. Administration of L-NAME (> or = 100 mg kg-1 I.A.) effectively suppressed the submandibular vasodilator response to infusions of VIP (10 and 20 ng I.A.) and significantly reduced, but did not abolish that to acetylcholine (100 ng min-1 I.A.). 6. These results provide further support for the view that both acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity (VIP) are released from the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals and produce effects on the blood vessels in submandibular glands of the cat. They also provide evidence for a direct vascular action of acetylcholine, independent of NO chi, but VIP appears to act indirectly via NO chi formation.", 
    "77": "The antiarrhythmic activity and acute toxicity of polymeric formulations of quinidine, trimecaine, ethacizine, propranolol, verapamil which had been immobilized on a cellulose carrier (monocarboxylcellulose) and low molecular analogues were studied in various experimental animals (rats, mice, dogs). The polymeric formulations of trimecaine and verapamil were found to have a higher antiarrhythmic activity in different arrhythmia models than trimecaine and verapamil. The toxicity of all new compounds was no more than the values of conventional antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "78": "Acute administration of propranolol, 1 mg/kg i.p., decreased the amplitude of locomotor circadian rhythm in rats and shifted its acrophase to late night hours. After chronic (10-day) treatment with the drug, morning rises in locomotion after turning out the light became less frequent. The circadian rhythm reorganization observed may depend on the effects of the beta-adrenoblocker on its specific receptors in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei and/or the pineal gland.", 
    "79": "The influence of interferon alpha on nuclear phosphoinositidase C (PIC) in Daudi cells has been analysed. Results showed an early increase of PIC activity detectable within 90 min of interferon treatment concomitant with an increase of diacylglcerol (DAG) levels. Since the interferon-induced DAG production is not modified by the addition of propranolol, a compound known to inhibit production of DAG from phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, it is suggested that the interferon antiproliferative signal is transduced into the nucleus via the inositol lipid pathway. A parallel analysis performed on intact cells showed a rapid inhibition of PIC activity accompanied by an increase of DAG level thus suggesting that interferon-generated signals at plasma-membrane level use pathways different from that of inositol lipids. A selected clone of Daudi cells resistant to interferon action provided a control for specificity of results.", 
    "80": "Following a 45-min period of coronary occlusion the myocardial infarct that developed after 24 h of blood reperfusion in the rabbit heart was studied in three groups of animals: controls (n = 7), and those pretreated with 3 mg.kg-1 of the piperazine derivative, trimetazidine (n = 7) or propranolol at 0.3 mg.kg-1 (n = 6). Twenty-four hours after coronary artery ligation for 45 min infarct size was measured in myocardial slices using trinitrophenyl-tetrazolium staining, and the \"area at risk\" was determined by injection of zinc/cadmium particles and delineated by imaging under fluorescent light the areas of tissue that did not fluoresce. The range of \"area at risk\" was similar in all of the groups. There was a significant reduction in the size of infarct that developed in the trimetazidine treated group when compared with the controls. In the propranolol treated group there was a slight reduction in infarct size when compared to control, but this was less than in the trimetazidine treated group and did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that pretreatment with trimetazidine in the blood perfused rabbit heart is effective in reducing myocardial infarct size.", 
    "81": "Blood flow heterogeneity in normal myocardium may be caused by heterogeneous metabolic demand. We studied, from 80 tissue samples of the left ventricle (LV) of eight anesthetised, open-chest dogs (with prior beta-blockade (metoprolol) in four dogs), the radioactivity of 201Thallium-chloride (201Tl), an indicator of blood flow, and of the fatty acid 131-Iodine-heptadecanoic acid (131I-HDA), an indicator of metabolic demand, 3 min after intravenous injection. Global LV uptake (in percent of injected dose x 10(-2), per g tissue; mean +/- SD) was 4.94 +/- 0.71 for 201Tl and 4.48 +/- 0.58 for 131I-HDA in the dogs without beta-blockade, and 2.08 +/- 0.26 and 1.69 +/- 0.20, respectively, in dogs with beta-blockade (p < 0.05). Beta-blockade thus decreased the fraction of cardiac output delivered to the LV, concurrently with a decreased heart rate and arterial blood pressure (p < 0.05) and, thus, global metabolic demand and fatty acid uptake. Regional radioactivities per gram were normalized for mean LV radioactivities and heterogeneity was expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV). For pooled data (n = 320) in dogs without beta-blockade, regional 201Tl and 131I-HDA radioactivities varied from a factor of 0.1 to 1.6 and 0.3 to 1.8 of mean radioactivities, with a CV of 22.9 and 19.4%, respectively, and correlated (r = 0.77, p < 0.005). For pooled data (n = 320) in dogs with beta-blockade, regional 201Tl and 131I-HDA radioactivities varied from a factor of 0.2 to 1.5 and 0.2 to 1.6 of mean radioactivity and CV was 23.6% and 24.8%, respectively; r = 0.92 (p < 0.005). The endo/epi ratio for both radioactivities exceeded unity in each dog. In normal myocardium, blood flow and fatty acid uptake are thus heterogeneous, both transmurally and circumferentially, and matched, concomitantly with coupling of global blood flow to global metabolic demand and fatty acid uptake. This supports the idea that heterogeneous myocardial O2 supply reflects heterogeneous metabolic demand.", 
    "82": "Influence of the autonomic nervous system on the heart rate response to active and passive orthostatism. The purposes of this study were twofold. First, to compare heart rate responses as measured by R-R interval under two conditions of orthostatic stress, i.e. a change from supine to an active free standing-up position (active orthostatism, AO), and from supine to a passive 70 head-up tilt posture (passive orthostatism, PO) second, to utilize a standard pharmacological model to study the participation of the autonomic nervous system upon heart rate responses evoked by AO. In the first part of the research, eight healthy subjects (seven men, one woman) were evaluated for AO and PO. In both occasions, subjects were supine for 5 minutes and then adopted an upright or a tilted position in 3-5 seconds and remained motionless during 5 minutes. In the second part, eight men participated twice in the pharmacological studies. In day one, they stood up for control (AOC), after IV administration of atropine sulfate (0.04 mg/kg) (AO+atro) and after IV administration of propranolol hydrochloride (0.16 mg/kg) (AO+ATRO+PROPRA). In day two, subjects repeated the control AO (AOCII) and after the administration for propranolol hydrochloride alone. In the first study, AO was characterized by a fast shortening of R-R interval, which was maximal at beat 15th (relative tachycardia), followed by a rebound lengthening of R-R interval, reaching a plateau at beat 30 (relative bradycardia), demonstrating a biphasic response. PO was characterized by a small and gradual shortening of R-R interval without the biphasic responses of AO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The relaxant response and cAMP production mediated by stimulation of isoproterenol is reduced in uterine rings from clenbuterol treated rats (0.25 mg kg-1 s.c. 24 hr before experiments) precontracted with 50 mM KCl. 2. Forskolin, in contrast, showed similar relaxant responses in untreated or clenbuterol treated rats. 3. Isoproterenol produces a biphasic response that is composed of a rapid relaxation followed by a slower regaining of tension, which is considered as desensitization. 4. The kinetic study demonstrates marked changes in the desensitization process of beta-adrenoceptors after clenbuterol administration.", 
    "84": "1. The effects of carazolol, celiprolol and their respective fluorinated derivatives (FD) on electrical stimulation threshold (EST) and ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) were compared with those of propranolol and propranolol-FD in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. 2. Carazolol, carazolol-FD, propranolol and propranolol-FD produced significant dose-dependent elevation of both EST and VFT at all tested concentration levels. In contrast, celiprolol and celiprolol-FD did not produce a significant change in either threshold. 3. On a dosage basis, the order of antifibrillatory potency of these compounds is: carazolol-FD > propranolol-FD > carazolol > propranolol > celiprolol-FD > celiprolol. 4. The results of this study seem to indicate the importance of membrane stabilizing effect for a potent antifibrillatory action of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. Furthermore, fluorination is demonstrated to produce more potent antifibrillatory activity than that of the parent drugs.", 
    "85": "1. In primary cultures of porcine granulosa cells incubation with isoproterenol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) produced a dose-dependent increase in 3 beta-HSD mRNA, 3 beta-HSD content and progesterone production which ranged from 1.5- to 5-fold. 2. These effects were completely blocked by alprenolol. Terbutaline (10(-6) M) increased 3 beta-HSD mRNA, 3 beta-HSD content and progesterone production (1.5- to 3-fold), an effect which could be prevented by alprenolol. 3. Treatment with dobutamine (10(-6) M) produced no significant change in 3 beta-HSD mRNA accumulation. 4. The results suggest that beta-adrenergic agonists have the capacity to regulate transcription and translation of 3 beta-HSD mRNA in granulosa cells and this effect is mediated by the beta 2 adrenergic receptor.", 
    "86": "The effects of chronic treatment with bunazosin, atenolol, ketanserin and verapamil on the myocardium of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were examined by the radioligand binding assay method using [3H]prazosin, [125I]iodocyanopindolol and [3H]nitrendipine binding to alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors and Ca2+ binding sites. The norepinephrine concentration in the rat myocardium was also determined. (1) All of these drugs lowered the elevated blood pressure of the SHR. (2) Only ketanserin administration increased the Kd value of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor in the SHR. (3) Administration of atenolol and ketanserin to the SHR decreased the Bmax value of the beta 1-adrenoceptor. (4) Verapamil, bunazosin and atenolol also lowered the Bmax values of the Ca2+ binding sites of SHRs. (5) All drugs except for atenolol lowered the norepinephrine concentration in the myocardium of the SHR. These findings suggest that the SHR has an abnormality of the alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors and Ca2+ binding site of the myocardium, that the drugs had a beneficial effect on these receptors, that the drugs could also lower the high norepinephrine content in the myocardium of the SHR and that some of these drugs also affected the binding characteristics of other types of membrane receptors.", 
    "87": "Cardiovascular effects of intravenously administered denopamine and its derivatives were investigated in anesthetized dogs and their positive inotropic and hypotensive effects were compared. Structure-activity relationships were examined by modifying the methoxy group in ring B and the hydroxy group in ring A in structure II, a ring-fissioned product of trimetoquinol. Almost all test compounds demonstrated positive inotropic and chronotropic effects as well as hypotensive effects which were mediated by beta-adrenoceptors. With modification of the methoxy group in ring B, only 3,4-dimethoxy, 2,3,4-trimethoxy and 3,4,5-trimethoxy derivatives exhibited beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity. The 3,4-dimethoxy derivative showed the most potent positive inotropic effect and the highest selectivity to beta 1-adrenoceptor. By structural modification of the hydroxyl group in ring A of the 3,4-dimethoxy derivatives, the potency of positive inotropic effect was affected, while beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity of the derivatives with 3,5-dihydroxy, 3- and 4-monohydroxy groups were essentially maintained. Among beta 1-adrenoceptor selective compounds, the dose ratios between intravenous and intraduodenal administrations of catechol derivatives like isoproterenol were higher than those of non-catechol derivatives. The 4-monohydroxy derivative (racemic denopamine) exhibited the smallest dose ratio with a long-lasting action. Thus, we could identify selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonists by the structural modification of a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, trimetoquinol. In this group of compounds, beta-hydroxy moiety was suggested to be requisite to potent beta-adrenoceptor stimulating action and 3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl structure was important for manifestation of beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity.", 
    "88": "The mechanism of pindolol-induced vasoconstriction in isolated and perfused dog coronary arteries was studied. Single injections of pindolol (1-100 micrograms), propranolol (1-30 micrograms), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 0.001-1 microgram) produced a dose-related vasoconstriction in dog coronary arteries which were dilated by acetylcholine. l-Pindolol constricted coronary arteries, but d-pindolol did not. The responses to pindolol and propranolol were not affected by any of the following compounds (100 micrograms): bunazosin (a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist), DG 5128 (a selective alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist), atropine (a muscarinic antagonist), chlorpheniramine (a selective H1-antagonist), cimetidine (a selective H2-antagonist), and ketanserin (a selective 5-HT2 antagonist). Methysergide (10 micrograms, a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist) significantly reduced pindolol- and propranolol-induced vasoconstrictions, although it did not reduce norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction in the presence of 5 microM propranolol. Methysergide (10 micrograms) and ketanserin (100 micrograms) significantly suppressed 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction. Diltiazem (100 micrograms, a calcium antagonist) and the incubation in Ca(2+)-free solution containing 1 mM EGTA for 1 hr significantly reduced the vasoconstrictions induced by pindolol and propranolol. The Ca(2+)-free solution containing 1 mM EGTA abolished the vasoconstriction induced by 5-HT in the presence of 1 microM ketanserine. In a solution containing 20 mM KCl, the vasoconstrictions caused by pindolol and propranolol were enhanced in dog coronary arteries. These results indicate that the direct contractile effects of pindolol on dog coronary arteries are mediated, at least partly, through 5-HT1-like receptors, but not through alpha-adrenergic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "A retrospective study of 179 eyes in 127 patients who underwent trabeculectomy at Sydney Eye Hospital under the supervision of two surgeons between 1977 and 1982 was carried out. Survival analysis by life table method shows cumulative two, five, and 10 year success rates to be 78%, 70%, and 67% respectively, with mean duration of intraocular pressure control (IOP < 21 mmHg) being 88 months. Antiglaucoma medication improved the long-term survival significantly (Hazard Ratio of 0.49 and P = 0.01) so that when the definition for failure is taken as IOP > 20 mmHg while using medication, the two, five and 10 year success rates were 89%, 87% and 86% respectively. A rise in average intraocular pressure is seen between two weeks and three months after trabeculectomy. The improvement in long-term success rate with use of topical steroids was suggestive (Hazard Ratio of 0.69) but not conclusive (P = 0.21). No difference was found in survival comparing fornix versus limbal based flap technique.", 
    "90": "The immediate goal of management of heart failure is to improve cardiac function and eliminate symptoms. On the other hand, the final goal is to improve the quality of life and survival. In this chapter, general approaches to fulfill these goals are discussed. First, precise evaluation of the patient is necessary and the underlying cause of heart failure must be diagnosed. If possible, the underlying cause should be rectified. Precipitating factors, such as infection, should also be removed. Appropriate therapeutic measures are then selected according to the type and severity of heart failure. In pharmacotherapy, digoxin, diuretics and vasodilators are usually used in combination. In refractory heart failure, inotropic drugs, including sympatomimetic amines, are usually effective. Special measures including dialysis and assisted circulation, may also be considered in acute or refractory heart failure. Finally, management of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with heart failure is still controversial.", 
    "91": "About 40% of cardiac death in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) has been reported to be due to ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Therefore, it is important to know how to treat ventricular arrhythmia associated with CHF. Recently, proarrhythmic effect and negative inotropic effect of antiarrhythmic drugs (class I agents), have been noted and class III agents, especially amiodarone is expected to have preventing effects for sudden death. Furthermore, drug therapy such as beta blocker and ACE inhibitor and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator has advanced.", 
    "92": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) due to idiopathic cardiomyopathy is reviewed. CHF in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is caused mainly by myocardial systolic dysfunction. Diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and digitalis are the first choice drugs. ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective in prolonging life and improving quality of life. Recently, long-term beta-blockade therapy has been shown to be useful. CHF in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by decreased myocardial compliance. The beneficial effect of verapamil in HCM is related to improved relaxation and diastolic filing. Verapamil is also effective in relieving myocardial ischemia. Beta-blockade decreases pressure gradient and oxygen consumption. Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy is a very rare disease and decreased myocardial compliance is responsible for CHF.", 
    "93": "In recent years, vasodilator drugs are considered a standard therapy for patients with symptomatic heart failure. Isosorbide dinitrate, venodilator, shows a striking fall in cardiac filling pressure. Hydralazine, arterially active vasodilator, decreases afterload and increases cardiac output. The combined use of nitrates and hydralazine shows synergistic effect in increasing cardiac output, lowering cardiac filling pressure and improving exercise tolerance and life expectancy. Prazosin showed no favourable effect on survival in a V-HeFT trial. Although calcium antagonists have been expected to improve hemodynamics in the patients with heart failure, there have been no controlled large trial to prove that the hemodynamic effect is accompanied by any improvement in exercise tolerance or quality of life. At the present, it is considered to be reasonable to use nitrates and hydralazine combined with ACE inhibitors, in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "94": "Catecholamines bind to cardiac beta-adrenoceptor to introduce positive inotropic, chronotropic, dromotropic and lucinotropic effects of the heart. Therapeutic catecholamines causes less effects to failing myocardium in comparison to normal myocardium. Down-regulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor (decrease in receptor number) and uncoupling of beta-adrenoceptor to G protein (increase in Gi alpha) have been demonstrated in failing human myocardium. Rapid improvement can be obtained in cardiac function by intravenous catecholamines, usually with dopamine and/or dobutamine in patients with acute heart failure. But, tachyphylaxis occurs in 72 hours which limits usefulness of the drugs. Dopamine has DA1-receptor activity which increases renal blood flow and natriuresis. Dobutamine is superior to dopamine in positive lucinotropic effects in reducing PCWP in patients with heart failure. Mechanisms of beta blocker therapy with special reference to molecular mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "95": "Radionuclide assessment of heart failure was reviewed in this paper. The measurement of left ventricular function has been established by using gated blood poor scan. In most cases, left ventricular ejection fraction was below 35% in heart failure. The therapeutic effect of beta-blocker was also evaluated by quantitative sector analysis from gated blood pool scan. In addition, the uptake of 111In-antimyosin Fab was observed at damaged myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy. 123I-MIBG which reflects sympathetic nerve activity showed decreased uptake in heart failure. It was demonstrated that cardiac MIBG imaging had powerful prognostic value in patients with heart failure. In conclusion, radionuclide assessment will contribute to the evaluation of severity and prognosis of heart failure.",

Each beta agonist was added cumulatively at each level of precontraction. Additional cumulative concentration response experiments were conducted for salmeterol alone at the highest level of precontraction, with and without beta blockade by sotalol (1 mmol/l). With the drug concentrations which produced the maximum response and the highest level of precontraction, the relaxation of formoterol (10 nmol/l) and salmeterol (1 mumol/l) was also compared non-cumulatively. Finally, with the corresponding drug concentrations and precontraction, the relaxant effect was compared for formoterol (10 nmol/l) in salmeterol relaxed airways with that of salmeterol (1 mumol/l) in formoterol relaxed airways.",

Significant differences in the maximum relaxant effect were shown at the highest level of precontraction only, with a remaining active tension of percentage precontraction of 27% (4%) for 1 mumol/l salbutamol and 35% (3%) for 10 nmol/l formoterol compared with 50% (2%) for 1 mumol/l salmeterol. The rank order of potency was: formoterol > salbutamol approximately salmeterol at all levels of precontraction (-log EC50: 9.32 (0.05) for formoterol, 7.82 (0.08) for salbutamol, and 7.50 (0.13) for salmeterol at 80% maximum precontraction). Beta blockade by sotalol (1 mmol/l) significantly inhibited the relaxation induced by salmeterol (1 mumol/l) (remaining active tension: 104% (1%) v 71% (11%) of precontraction) but not the relaxation induced by salmeterol (10 mumol/l) (remaining active tension: 75% (5%) v 71% (12%) of precontraction). In the non-cumulative experiments, formoterol displayed more relaxant effect than salmeterol (remaining active tension: 51% (6%) v 65% (6%) of precontraction). Finally, formoterol significantly relaxed salmeterol relaxed airways (relaxant effect: 22% (8%) of precontraction) whereas there was no significant response to salmeterol in formoterol relaxed airways (relaxant effect: 5% (12%) of precontraction).", 
    "100": "In the guinea pig isolated trachea, formoterol and salbutamol produce more relaxant effect than salmeterol, suggesting that salmeterol is a partial beta 2 agonist. Very high concentrations of salmeterol may induce non-beta adrenoceptor mediated relaxation. Formoterol is more potent than both salbutamol and salmeterol. There is no pronounced difference in the magnitude of antagonism against carbachol induced contractions between salmeterol, formoterol, and salbutamol.", 
    "101": "The elimination of [3H]pafenolol and metabolites was investigated in fasted and fed rats. Separate groups received intravenous doses (0.3 and 3.0 mumol/kg) and oral doses (1 and 25 mumol/kg). After iv administration of pafenolol, the excretion of unchanged drug into urine and feces was about 50 and 25-30% of the given dose, respectively. The predominating mechanism for the excretion of pafenolol into feces was intestinal excretion (exsorption) directly from blood into gut lumen, since only about 3% of a given iv dose was recovered as pafenolol in the bile. When the oral dose was raised from 1 to 25 mumol/kg, the mean (+/- SD) bioavailability, calculated from urine data, increased from 14 +/- 9 to 30 +/- 11% (P < 0.05) in the starved rats and from 14 +/- 3 to 16 +/- 3% in the fed animals. In parallel, the fraction absorbed from the gut (fa) increased from 19 +/- 9 to 31 +/- 10% in the starved rats and from 16 +/- 4 to 19 +/- 5% in the fed animals, respectively. This indicates that the low bioavailability is due primarily to poor intestinal uptake.", 
    "102": "The prevalence rates and correlates of antihypertensive drug use among individuals with hypertension were determined using data derived from five biennial population-based surveys conducted between 1981 and 1990 in two New England communities. Point prevalence estimates were determined for nine categories of antihypertensive agents at five time points, and were analyzed by age and sex using multiple logistic regression. In the first cross-sectional survey, the prevalence of use per 1000 individuals with hypertension was 235.4 for diuretics, 57.1 for beta-blockers, 65.5 for combination products, 29.2 for central alpha-agonists, 2.8 for peripheral alpha-antagonists, and 8.4 each for adrenergic blockers and direct vasodilators. The prevalence rates for calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increased sharply between the third and fourth survey cycles. Significant age- and sex-related differences in antihypertensive use were detected.", 
    "103": "Pafenolol is a beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist exhibiting some interesting oral absorption properties in both rat and humans. The blood concentration-time profile exhibits two peaks, and the bioavailability is low and dose-dependent due to an incomplete and nonlinear intestinal uptake. The origin of the presystemic metabolism was studied in rats after oral and intraperitoneal administration of tritium-labeled pafenolol with reference to the intravenous route by means of urinary excretion data of pafenolol and metabolites specifically assayed by HPLC and radioisotope detection. The oral-bioavailability increased from 15.8 +/- 4.1% (1.0 mumol/kg) to 33.3 +/- 5.8% (25 mumol/kg, p < 0.001). This was primarily due to a change in the fraction of the absorbed dose (fa) from 21.9 +/- 4.6 to 39.5 +/- 7.9% (p < 0.01). The bioavailability following an intraperitoneal dose was almost complete indicating that the presystemic metabolism was due to gut wall metabolism. Saturation of the presystemic metabolism contributed only by approximately 15-20% to the 2-fold increase of bioavailability. This clearly indicates that the underlying mechanism for the low and dose-dependent bioavailability was an incomplete and nonlinear intestinal uptake. The metabolic pattern showed that at least eight metabolites are formed in the rat. One of these is an alpha-OH pafenolol, identified as the main metabolite in human urine by mass spectrometry.",

An extensive work-up searching for a cause is not indicated. Controlling hypertension has been shown to decrease incidence of stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction and sudden death. Thiazide and beta-blockers have stood the test of time and have the best track record in preventing complications of hypertension. Surrogate endpoints of therapy, such as effect on insulin resistance, are interesting from an academic point of view. But they are no substitute for randomised clinical trials and the real endpoints of stroke, myocardial infarction and sudden death.",

The problem of systemic drug absorption should be taken into account in designing ocular drug and dosage forms so that oculospecificity of the medications is optimized. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about the systemic absorption of ocularly applied topical drugs. Special emphasis is directed to the methods that can be used to minimize systemic absorption and increase the oculospecificity of drugs, e.g., reducing volume and increasing viscosity of eyedrops, controlling drug release from depot preparations, prodrug-derivatization, and addition of vasoconstrictive agents.", 
    "108": "It has previously been demonstrated that cocaine stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) secretion. The role of different neurotransmitters in mediation of the cocaine-induced elevation of plasma corticosterone (CORT) were investigated in rats by using transmitter antagonists. Peripheral (IP) pretreatment with a dopaminergic antagonist, pimozide (0.01-1.0 mg/kg, IP), a noradrenergic blocker, phenoxybenzamine (1.0-4.0 mg/kg, IP), a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol (0.2-10 mg/kg, IP), an opiate antagonist, naloxone (1.0-4.0 mg/kg, IP), and a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, atropine (1.0-4.0 mg/kg, IP), inhibited the cocaine-induced CORT response dose dependently. A similar dose-dependent inhibition of the plasma CORT response induced by cocaine was observed after the ICV route of administration of these antagonists in microgram quantities. None of the investigated IP or ICV doses of transmitter antagonists altered the basal CORT level. These results suggest that the activation of multiple neurotransmitter systems, including catecholaminergic, opiate, and cholinergic systems, might be responsible for the cocaine-induced HPA axis activation, probably through the specific receptors located in the CNS.", 
    "109": "Cerebral noradrenergic systems have been implicated in stress-related changes in behavior. Previous studies with receptor antagonists suggested that alpha 1-adrenergic receptors were involved in defensive withdrawal in rats and in investigatory behavior in mice tested in the multicompartment chamber. However, beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists attenuated the restraint- and ICV CRF-induced changes in defensive withdrawal, suggesting that beta-adrenergic receptors may also be involved in stress-related responses. To determine whether the beta-adrenergic antagonist effect was limited to rats tested in the defensive withdrawal model, we studied the effects of L-propranolol in two other behavioral models. Propranolol pretreatment (2.5 mg/kg, IP) prevented the restraint-induced changes in the behavior of mice observed in the multicompartment chamber and the elevated plus-maze. It also decreased the plasma corticosterone response measured in restrained mice after plus-maze testing. To investigate further the role of central beta-adrenergic receptors in defensive withdrawal, the effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol were tested. Isoproterenol (0.3-10 micrograms, ICV) produced a dose-dependent increase in defensive withdrawal, statistically significant after 3 and 10 micrograms. Propranolol prevented the isoproterenol-induced defensive withdrawal, suggesting that the effect of isoproterenol resulted from stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. These results support earlier data suggesting the involvement of CNS beta-adrenergic receptors in stress-related behavioral changes and suggest that beta-adrenergic agonists exert anxiolytic effects that differ from those of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "110": "1. The antagonist activity of atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol in the CNS was estimated by determining the extent to which the drugs occupy animal beta 1- and beta 2-receptors in CSF ex vivo at the time of lumbar puncture. 2. Five CSF and plasma samples were obtained 4 h after drug intake from subjects treated for hypertension with atenolol, 100 mg once daily and five from subjects treated with metoprolol, 50 mg three times daily. Twenty-four samples were obtained 1, 2, 4 or 12 h after drug intake from subjects receiving a single 40 mg dose of propranolol. 3. The receptor occupancy in the samples was determined by adding beta 1-receptors of rabbit lung and beta 2-receptors of rat reticulocytes into the samples and labeling the receptors with a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (-)-[3H]-CGP-12177. 4. Atenolol and metoprolol occupied, as expected, larger fractions of beta 1- than beta 2-receptors in CSF and plasma samples. The receptor fraction occupied by atenolol in CSF was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that occupied by metoprolol. The differences in occupancy between the drugs in plasma, however, were not statistically significant. 5. Propranolol occupied larger fractions of beta 2- than beta 1-receptors in the samples. Although propranolol concentrations in CSF were only 1/20-1/40 of those in plasma, the receptor occupancy of propranolol in CSF was similar to that in plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients were randomly allocated to receive either esmolol 500 micrograms.kg-1 over 1 min followed by 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 or placebo starting prior to reversal. Significant hypertension and tachycardia occurred in the placebo group, whilst these changes were prevented by the administration of esmolol.", 
    "112": "The locomotor hyperactivity induced by 3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and related drugs in rats appears to be due to the drug-induced release of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT). Thus, these drugs increase locomotor activity by acting as indirect 5-HT agonists. The subtype of 5-HT receptor upon which this released 5-HT acts postsynaptically to produce the activating effect of MDMA-like drugs is not known. When tested under conditions in which MDMA increases locomotion, direct agonists at both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C/2 receptors consistently decrease locomotion. Hence, the present experiments tested the hypothesis that the hyperactivity produced by the release of endogenous 5-HT is due to the activation of 5-HT1B receptors. Using the Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM), the profile of behavioral effects of a 5-HT1B agonist, 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6)tetrahydropyridin-4yl)-1H-indole (RU 24969), was compared to that previously described for MDMA and related indirect 5-HT agonists. The BPM provided detailed information regarding the amount and qualitative patterning of locomotor activity and investigatory responses in rats. Various doses of RU 24969 (1.25 to 5 mg/kg) were administered to naive male rats 10 minutes prior to placement in the test chambers. As previously reported for MDMA, locomotor activity increased with dose, and investigatory rearings and holepokes decreased. The hyperactivity was characterized by repetitive spatial patterns of locomotion that were qualitatively similar to those produced by indirect 5-HT agonists such as MDMA and dissimilar to those produced by indirect dopamine (DA) agonists such as amphetamine. Pretreatment with racemic propranolol but not (+)propranolol antagonized the hyperactivity induced by RU 24959. Fluoxetine, a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, failed to block the locomotor activating effects of RU 24969. These findings confirm the similarity between the behavioral effects of RU 24969 and indirect 5-HT agonists and suggest that the locomotor hyperactivity produced by both RU 24969 and MDMA is mediated by the activation of 5-HT1B receptors. Although the effects of MDMA on 5-HT1B receptors are secondary to its ability to release presynaptic 5-HT, the activation produced by RU 24969 appears to be a consequence of its direct agonist effects.", 
    "113": "All eye drops raise problems of local tolerance, but with variable frequencies. They can induce pain on instillation, allergic reactions, delayed healing, punctate keratitis, disturbances of lacrimal secretion, disturbances of accommodation (especially the parasympathomimetics) and local pigmentation after prolonged use. Corticosteroids are associated with 2 major risks: chronic glaucoma and cataract, initially reversible if treatment is stopped. There is still a major risk of corneal herpes with corticosteroids. It is important to be aware of these local problems as they are responsible for poor patient compliance. The systemic effects essentially concern the agonists and antagonists of the autonomic nervous system. beta-Blocker eye drops can cause bronchospasm, heart failure, syncope and psychiatric disorders, especially at high doses and with nonselective beta-blockers. These consequences are usually related to failure to comply with the prescribing precautions. alpha-Adrenergic agonists, which exert dose-dependent effects, can induce hypertensive crises or angina attacks. Apart from patients at risk (children under the age of 30 months and the elderly), parasympathomimetics cause few systemic adverse effects; anticholinesterases, which have curare-like properties, are contraindicated for 6 weeks before general anesthesia. In the very young and the very old, atropinic eye drops carry a risk of cardiovascular collapse and neuropsychiatric disturbances. Problems may also occur with other classes of drugs such as anti-infectives, antispectics, anti-inflammatories and contact lens products. Nevertheless, it is clear that this form of treatment is generally very well tolerated in relation to the volume of eye drops prescribed by ophthalmologists each day.", 
    "114": "The effects of different doses of p-tyramine injected i.v. and i.p. on salivary flow rates and proteins secreted by the submandibular glands of rats were studied with and without various types of autonomic blockers and two enzyme inhibitors. The salivary flow rates and the amounts of protein secreted progressively increased with increasing doses injected both i.v. and i.p., whereas they were dramatically reduced with all autonomic blockers except the lowest doses of beta-blockers, atropine, and yohimbine. Salivation in response to p-tyramine injected i.v. and i.p. was completely abolished by simultaneous injections of both prazosin and propranolol. The concentration of protein was not dose-dependent and was not reduced by yohimbine and phenoxybenzamine at almost all doses used. However, prazosin significantly increased the protein concentration. Protease activities were dose-dependent but were significantly reduced with alpha-blockers other than yohimbine, and with most beta-blockers. The proteins secreted in response to p-tyramine at all doses injected i.v. and i.p. were of the alpha-type except with the lowest dose injected i.p. However, the alpha-type was completely replaced by the beta-type in the presence of all alpha-blockers except yohimbine, but not with beta-blockers, atropine, or two enzyme inhibitors. Pargyline, a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor, but not disulfiram, a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, affected all parameters except the type of protein. Thus, p-tyramine may activate both the alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors in the submandibular glands of rats directly or indirectly.", 
    "115": "The macrophage secretory product tumor necrosis factor (TNF) impairs insulin action on peripheral glucose uptake and hepatic glucose output. Because circulating catecholamines are also elevated by TNF, the present study was performed to determine the role of the adrenergic system in eliciting the insulin resistance. Human recombinant TNF (1 microgram.h-1.kg-1) was infused intravenously into chronically catheterized fasted rats for approximately 18 h. Before TNF, an infusion of either saline, propranolol (nonselective beta-antagonist), atenolol (selective beta 1-antagonist), or phentolamine (alpha-antagonist) was started and continued throughout the experimental protocol. Infusion of either the alpha- or beta-receptor antagonist failed to prevent the TNF-induced increase in basal glucose uptake or hepatic glucose output. Under euglycemic hyperinsulinemic conditions, whole body glucose disposal was lower in TNF-infused rats than in control animals. This resulted from a decreased rate of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, skin, and intestine. In propranolol-infused rats, but not in those receiving atenolol or phentolamine, the TNF-induced decrease in whole body glucose uptake was partially prevented. Propranolol attenuated the development of peripheral insulin resistance by selectively preventing the decrease in glucose uptake by skeletal muscle but not by skin and ileum. Propranolol was also able to ameliorate the hepatic insulin resistance produced by TNF. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation, probably mediated by a beta 2-adrenergic mechanism, is partially responsible for the development of both peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance in animals infused with TNF.", 
    "116": "The left ventricle (LV) and arterial system are nearly optimally coupled to produce stroke work (SW) at rest. However, the effect of exercise on the coupling between the LV and arterial system has not been directly determined. We evaluated 11 dogs who were instrumented to determine LV volume from three diameters. The LV end-systolic pressure (Pes)-volume (Ves) relation was determined by transient caval occlusion at rest and while the animals ran at 5-7 mph on a treadmill. During exercise, the Pes-Ves relation was shifted toward the left and the slope [end-systolic elastance (Ees)] increased from 7.7 +/- 2.8 to 12.7 +/- 4.2 (SD) mmHg/ml (P < 0.05). The arterial end-systolic elastance (Ea), calculated as Pes divided by stroke volume, increased during exercise (8.8 +/- 3.0 to 10.9 +/- 4.7 mmHg/ml, P < 0.05). The ratio of Ees to Ea increased during exercise from 0.89 +/- 0.31 to 1.27 +/- 0.12 (P < 0.05). The portion of the pressure-volume area expressed as SW increased during exercise from 0.63 +/- 0.07 to 0.69 +/- 0.10 (P < 0.05). After adrenergic blockade, the Ees-to-Ea ratio was not significantly altered during exercise (0.90 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.83 +/- 0.15, P = NS). At rest and during exercise, both with intact reflexes and after beta-adrenergic blockade, the ratio of Ees to Ea remained within the range in which SW is > 95% of maximum. We conclude that during exercise, beta-adrenergic stimulation shifts the LV Pes-Ves relation to the left with an increased slope. This more than offsets the increase in Ea.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "117": "Adult catfish, Ictalurus melas, hepatocytes respond to alpha-agonists by increasing intracellular free calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in a dose-dependent manner. Basal [Ca2+]i were approximately 78 nM in catfish hepatocytes; this value was increased by 213, 243, 131, and 238 nM in the presence of epinephrine (Epi; 10(-6) M), norepinephrine (NE; 10(-5) M), phenylephrine (PE; 10(-4) M), and isoproterenol (Iso; 10(-4) M), respectively. The binding constants were 3.4 x 10(-8), 2.6 x 10(-7), 9.8 x 10(-7), and 6.1 x 10(-5) M for Epi, NE, PE, and Iso, respectively, which is the same order of potency for these agonists reported for the alpha 1-adrenoceptor system of mammalian hepatocytes. The Epi-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were antagonized equally by phentolamine (PH; 10(-8) M) and yohimbine (10(-8) M) but poorly by propranolol (Prop; 10(-6) M), as indicated by their respective inhibitory constants. Epi (10(-7) M) induced a time-dependent increase in hepatocyte adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate concentration that was antagonized by Prop but not PH. There were, however, no clear agonist-induced changes in the activities of glycogen phosphorylase (total, a, or %a) under these conditions. These studies provide evidence that Epi and other adrenergic agonists increase [Ca2+]i by an alpha- or alpha 1-like adrenoceptor pathway in catfish hepatocytes, but the biochemical effector system responding to changes in [Ca2+]i has yet to be elucidated.", 
    "118": "Recently, we found that the beta 1/beta 2 adrenoceptor blocking agent (-)penbutolol prevents behavioral and biochemical actions of the specific serotonin (5-HT)1A agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. The putative 5-HT1 receptor antagonist profile of (-)penbutolol was further explored in the present study, using in vivo microdialysis methods to assess its effects on central 5-HT release. (+)Penbutolol and (-)pindolol were included for comparison purposes. In contrast to (-)pindolol (8.0 mg/kg s.c.), administration of (-)penbutolol (2.0 or 8.0 mg/kg s.c.) increased hippocampal 5-HT output. The (-)penbutolol-induced 5-HT response was dose-related, stereoselective and Ca(++)-dependent. In addition, the 5-HT response to (-)penbutolol was abolished by omitting the 5-HT reuptake blocker citalopram from the perfusion medium, suggesting the need for endogenous 5-HT tone. Local (-)penbutolol (1 microM) perfusion increased the 5-HT output per se, and also blocked 5-HT release suppression caused by the 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP-93,129. Furthermore, (-)penbutolol, but not its (+)antipode, prevented the decrease of 5-HT release induced by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. By comparison, the 5-HT1 receptor inactive beta adrenoceptor blockers metoprolol (beta 1) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2), given alone or in combination, did not increase 5-HT output and were ineffective in antagonizing the (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin response. The data indicate that (-)penbutolol possesses 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonist properties, and may be a useful tool in studies of central 5-HT receptor-mediated function.", 
    "119": "1. The effects of tienoxolol, (ethyl 2-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-5- [(2-thienylcarbonyl) amino] benzoate, hydrochloride), a novel drug exhibiting both diuretic and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, were investigated on urinary 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and PGE2 excretion in the rat and compared to those of reference diuretic (furosemide) and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (acebutolol, propranolol). Since tienoxolol was shown to bind to A1 and A2 adenosine receptors, the action of theophylline was also evaluated. 2. Tienoxolol (8-128 mg kg-1, p.o.) induced a dose-related increase of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion from 32 mg kg-1 but a significant elevation of urinary PGE2 levels was only reached after administration of 128 mg kg-1. However, renal prostaglandin concentrations were not modified by tienoxolol. 3. Furosemide (32 mg kg-1) displayed a strong diuretic activity but did not enhance 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion. Likewise, the latter was unaffected by acebutolol and propranolol (128 mg kg-1) and no significant diuresis was observed following administration of these two beta-blocking agents. Theophylline (64 mg kg-1), like tienoxolol, was able to induce both diuresis and urinary prostaglandin excretion. Furthermore, they bound with similar affinities to A1 and A2 adenosine receptors. This led to the suggestion that a relationship between P1-purinoceptors, prostaglandin release, diuresis and natriuresis could exist. 4. Oral co-administration of NECA (0.2 mg kg-1) with tienoxolol markedly reduced the urinary 6-keto-PGF1 alpha excretion observed when tienoxolol was administered alone. However, neither diuresis nor natriuresis were modified, demonstrating that the proposed relationship was untenable. 5. In conclusion, PGI2 probably does not participate in the diuretic and natriuretic activity oftienoxolol. The increase of urinary 6-keto-PGF1alpha excretion may result not only from the haemodynamic properties of the drug but also from the rise of the urinary flow induced by tienoxolol."
