    "2": "Neuropsychological performance improved over the year of treatment but was unrelated to change in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Neither mean resting rCBF nor responsivity to a working memory task changed significantly with treatment. However, patients with greater lowering of systolic BP during treatment showed increased rCBF responsivity to a working memory task in medial and orbital frontal areas and decreased rCBF responsivity in mid frontal, parietal, thalamus, and pons (as well as lower thalamic rCBF pretreatment). Improved working memory performance over the treatment period was related to decreased responsivity in medial frontal, medullary, and parietal areas. Patients showing greater lowering of BP with treatment seemed to reduce excitatory and enhance inhibitory coupling between memory processing and BP more than those with less treatment success.",

    "4": "beta-Carbolines (BCs) are considered as endogenous neurotoxins that may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, several lines of evidences show that these compounds have neuroprotective effect. This study was designed to assess effect of long term exposure to norharman, a BC compound which in mammalian brain occurs at high levels in the substantia nigra, on the progress of parkinsonism induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Animals were daily treated by norharman at doses 100, 200 and 1000microg/kg (i.p.) just before to four weeks after the intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA. Statistical analysis of apomorphine-induced rotation tests demonstrates that treatment by norharman at doses 200 and 1000microg/kg for four weeks exacerbates significantly behavioral symptoms of the parkinsonism. To explore mechanisms by which norharman affects nigral dopaminergic cells, we studied the role of L-type Ca2+ channels. For this purpose, animals were daily treated with either L-type Ca2+ channel blocker of nifedipine at doses 2 and 5mg/kg (i.p.) or nifedipine together with norharman before to four weeks after the 6-OHDA injection. While treatment with nifedipine improved behavioral symptoms of the parkinsonism, treatment with both nifedipine and norharman had no affect on these symptoms. This data indicates that long term exposure to BCs promote nigral dopaminergic cell death possibly through L-type Ca2+ channels.", 
    "5": "Autophagy is a physiological degradative process key to cell survival during nutrient deprivation, cell differentiation and development. It plays a major role in the turnover of damaged macromolecules and organelles, and it has been involved in the pathogenesis of different cardiovascular diseases. Activation of the adrenergic system is commonly associated with cardiac fibrosis and remodeling, and cardiac fibroblasts are key players in these processes. Whether adrenergic stimulation modulates cardiac fibroblast autophagy remains unexplored. In the present study, we aimed at this question and evaluated the effects of b(2)-adrenergic stimulation upon autophagy. Cultured adult rat cardiac fibroblasts were treated with agonists or antagonists of beta-adrenergic receptors (b-AR), and autophagy was assessed by electron microscopy, GFP-LC3 subcellular distribution, and immunowesternblot of endogenous LC3. The predominant expression of b(2)-ARs was determined and characterized by radioligand binding assays using [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol. Both, isoproterenol and norepinephrine (non-selective b-AR agonists), as well as salbutamol (selective b(2)-AR agonist) increased autophagic flux, and these effects were blocked by propanolol (b-AR antagonist), ICI-118,551 (selective b(2)-AR antagonist), 3-methyladenine but not by atenolol (selective b(1)-AR antagonist). The increase in autophagy was correlated with an enhanced degradation of collagen, and this effect was abrogated by the inhibition of autophagic flux. Overall, our data suggest that b(2)-adrenergic stimulation triggers autophagy in cardiac fibroblasts, and that this response could contribute to reduce the deleterious effects of high adrenergic stimulation upon cardiac fibrosis.", 
    "6": "We evaluated celiprolol-induced vasodilatation in aorta taken from 12-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the effect of AT(1) angiotensin II receptor antagonism on the vasodilatory action of celiprolol in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR. In WKY rats, the celiprolol-induced relaxation was greatly decreased in denuded aorta, and completely abolished in intact aorta by N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 100 microM). In SHR, celiprolol-induced relaxation was reduced compared to WKY rats (E(max) (value obtained for the highest concentration, 300 microM)=39.1+ or - 3.78%, n=21 vs. 80.4 + or - 3% in WKY rats, n=10; P<0.0001). Endothelium removal or pre-treatment with l-NAME did not alter celiprolol-induced relaxation in SHR. In both strains, relaxation to celiprolol was decreased in the presence of nadolol (a beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 10 microM). N-[[3-[(2S)-2-hydroxy-3-[[2-[4-[(phenylsulfonyl)amino] phenyl]ethyl]amino] propoxy]phenyl]methyl]-acetamide (L748337, a beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 7 microM) had no effect. A 12-day treatment with candesartan cilexetil (an AT(1) receptor antagonist, 0.37 or 1mg/kg/day) reduced systolic blood pressure in both strains, but only improved relaxation to celiprolol in SHR, and only at the highest dose (E(max)=64.2+/-3.9%, n=10, P<0.0001 vs. SHR control). In both strains, local aortic AT(1) receptor antagonism with candesartan CV11974 (100 microM) had no effect. The endothelial beta(1)/beta(2) relaxation induced by celiprolol was therefore impaired in SHR aorta and AT(1) receptor antagonism improved the response to celiprolol, in conjunction with a reduction in blood pressure. This work highlights the need to analyse the potential benefit of a combination of celiprolol/AT(1) receptor antagonist in the treatment of hypertension.",

The effects of carvedilol (1 and 5 mg/kg i.v.) on blood pressure, heart rate and blood pressure variability were recorded. Enantioselective carvedilol plasma pharmacokinetics were studied by means of traditional blood sampling. The relationship between carvedilol concentrations and their hypotensive and bradycardic effects was established by means of PK-PD modelling. Vascular sympatholytic activity of carvedilol was assessed by the estimation of drug effects on low frequency blood pressure variability by means of spectral analysis.", 
    "9": "A dose-dependent increase in volume of distribution, as well as a greater volume of distribution and clearance of S-carvedilol as compared with the R-enantiomer was found in both experimental groups. Although the PK-PD properties of the S-carvedilol chronotropic effect were not altered in L-NAME rats, hypertensive rats showed greater potency and efficacy to the carvedilol hypotensive response. Greater potency of carvedilol for inhibition of sympathetic vascular activity was found in L-NAME rats.", 
    "10": "Carvedilol showed enantioselective non-linear pharmacokinetic properties in both groups.

    "11": "During atrial fibrillation (AF), RR interval histograms show different populations of predominant RR (pRR) intervals. These pRR intervals have been suggested to be multiples of the refractory period of the atrioventricular (AV) node or caused by the existence of a dual AV node physiology. In this study, the hypothesis that pRR intervals are related to the dominant atrial fibrillatory rate is tested.", 
    "12": "In this study, Holter electrocardiogram signals from 55 patients with persistent AF were analyzed. Number and position of pRR intervals were detected and compared with mean and standard deviation of the dominant atrial cycle length (DACL). In addition, effects of an enhancement of vagal activity and rate-control treatments (\u03b2-blockers and verapamil) were evaluated.", 
    "13": "In all patients with more than one pRR interval and in 47% with one pRR interval, RR interval populations were statistically related with multiples of the DACL. During night activities and during \u03b2-blockers treatment, mean ventricular rate was decreased (P < 0.01). This change was associated with a variation in the percentage of occurrences of each pRR (P < 0.01), whereas no statistical differences were present in the mean DACL or in the position of pRR intervals. A variation of the DACL due to verapamil was associated with a consistent modification in the position of the pRR intervals.",

    "15": "In the light of some new information based on clinical evidence, current therapeutic approach to patients with acute coronary syndrome especially focusing on oral therapy is being considered. The initial stage of treatment does not differ greatly among patients with unstable angina pectoris (UA), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is necessary to simultaneously resolve a series of problems within the first twenty minutes upon admission, i.e. risk assessment, selection of treatment strategy (conservative, invasive), relief of ischemic pain, determination of hemodynamic status and elimination of any undesired complications (hypertension, tachycardia, heart failure), and administration of antithrombotic therapy. Patients suffering from STEMI require reperfusion treatment, and the method of choice is primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where available. Fibrinolytic reperfusion therapy is limited exclusively to STEMI within the first three hours from the onset of pain. Unlike this, in patients suffering from UA/NSTEMI it is necessary to make risk assessment in the early stage of disease, and thus select the patients that will certainly benefit from invasive treatment through PCI. For pain relief, the patient should be immediately administered nitroglycerin along with oxygen. Beta-blockers that are reasonably used in the initial stage of treatment during the first 24 hours, if not contraindicated, are still underused. Clopidogrel becomes an obligatory drug not only in patients having undergone PCI, but also in those treated conservatively following fibrinolysis.", 
    "16": "There is an evident need for solid oral dosage forms allowing patients' tailor-made dosing due to variations in metabolization or small therapeutic indexes of drug substances. The objective of this work is the development of a device equipped with a novel solid dosage form, containing carvedilol as model drug, for the delivery of monolithical drug carriers in individual doses. The device was developed and constructed enabling an exact feed rate and dose adjustment by a cutting mechanism. A twin-screw extruder was used for producing cylindrical solid dosage forms. Divided doses were characterized by mass variation, cutting behavior and drug dissolution in order to investigate their applicability for practical use. Different formulations could be extruded obtaining straight cylindrical rods, which are divisible in exact slices by using the novel device. Forces below 20 N were needed to divide doses which comply with pharmacopoeial specification \"conformity of mass\". The developed formulations exhibit a sustained release of carvedilol within a range from 7 up to 16 h. A novel system consisting of a device and a cylindrical dosage form was developed. Patients' individual doses can be applied as monolithical solid dosage forms for oral use.", 
    "17": "Objective. The aim of this paper is to describe a fatal case of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in a patient with severe heart failure, who was treated with low-dose propranolol. Patient and Interventions. We report on a 7-month-old boy with Downs syndrome who was born with an unbalanced, left dominant atrioventricular septal defect and aortic coarctation. Despite coarctation repair and pulmonary artery banding he developed intractable heart failure and fever of unknown origin. Since he remained in heart failure he received a trial of low-dose propranolol to stabilize his cardiopulmonary status, which resulted in unexpected immunomodulatory effects. Measurements and Main Result. Immunoactivation was evidenced by high concentrations of procalcitonin, soluble CD 25, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin 6 and 8. Propranolol resulting in hepatic compromise as indicated by high lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase levels. A therapeutic switch from propranolol to the beta(1)-receptor blocker metoprolol appeared to be instrumental in hemodynamic improvement and allowed discharge from hospital. However, the infant ultimately died from secondary inflammatory reactivation and intractable pulmonary obstructive disease. The autopsy results revealed HLH. Conclusion. Our case describes HLH secondary to heart failure and Downs syndrome. In this highly activated inflammatory state the beneficial hemodynamic effects of propranolol may be accompanied by immunomodulatory effects and the risk of acute liver failure. HLH occurs with a distinct pathophysiology, and specific treatment might be mandatory to increase the chance of survival.",

Data were abstracted for dose, type, and daily frequency for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Target doses for each medication class were based on current guidelines. Patients with devices (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, CRT with defibrillators, or CRT with pacemakers) more frequently received evidence-based medical therapy than did those without such devices, although treatment at or above target doses was low for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators 32.6%, CRT with pacemaker 30.7%, CRT with defibrillator 32.0%, no device 34.6%) and \u03b2-blockers (20.2%, 17.4%, 20.4%, and 15.3%, respectively). Fewer patients received aldosterone antagonists, although when used, doses were more frequently within the target dosing range (70.1%, 72.1%, 72.7%, and 76.5%, respectively). Multivariable models showed that use of CRT with defibrillators and CRT with pacemakers was significantly associated with delivery of \u03b2-blockers at or above target doses, but no device therapies were associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or aldosterone antagonist dosing.",

    "34": "This study aims at evaluating occurrence and treatment efficiency of five estrogenic hormones and ten beta blockers in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The use of consistent sampling procedures, analytical techniques and data processing enabled to achieve an accurate comparison of the performances of the different treatment processes. First, the occurrence of molecules was evaluated in fourteen rural and urban WWTP located in France. Free and total estrogens were analyzed showing that more than 84% of estrogens in the dissolved phase of influent samples are in the free form. In effluent samples, comparable mean values but higher variation are underlined (RSD from 13 to 54% depending on the estrogen, compared to 11-21% for influents). Most of the target molecules are quantified in 30 influent and 31 effluent samples. Similar occurrence frequencies are obtained for influents from rural (6 WWTP) and urban areas (8 WWTP), except for betaxolol which is only quantified in urban wastewaters. Removal efficiencies of 8 biological treatments were studied: suspended growth biomass (activated sludge) and attached growth systems (biofilter, rotating biological contactor, reed-bed filter, trickling filter). Biological treatments are efficient to remove estrogens from the dissolved phase, with removal rate around 90%. For beta blockers, acebutolol and nadolol are efficiently removed (mean removal rate of 80%), whereas sotalol and propranolol are hardly impacted by biological treatments (removal rate below 20%). Finally, 9 tertiary treatment processes were evaluated. Ozonation, reverse osmosis and activated carbon filtration prove a high removal efficiency for beta blockers (above 80%). On the contrary, high speed chemical settler, sand filtration, silex filtration, microfiltration and UV present generally removal rates below 30% for all beta blockers. The polishing pond studied presents variable removal performances depending on the molecules (up to 75% for propranolol). The role of the hydraulic retention time on the removal efficiencies is confirmed.", 
    "35": "The acute administration of MDMA has been shown to promote glycogenolysis and increase the extracellular concentration of glucose in the striatum. In the present study the role of serotonergic and/or noradrenergic mechanisms in the MDMA-induced increase in extracellular glucose and glycogenolysis was assessed. The relationship of these responses to the hyperthermia produced by MDMA also was examined. The administration of MDMA (10mg/kg, i.p.) resulted in a significant and sustained increase of 65-100% in the extracellular concentration of glucose in the striatum, as well as in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and a 35% decrease in brain glycogen content. Peripheral blood glucose was modestly increased by 32% after MDMA treatment. Treatment of rats with fluoxetine (10mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the MDMA-induced increase in extracellular glucose in the striatum but had no effect on MDMA-induced glycogenolysis or hyperthermia. Treatment with prazosin (1mg/kg, i.p.) did not alter the glucose or glycogen responses to MDMA but completely suppressed MDMA-induced hyperthermia. Finally, propranolol (3mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the MDMA-induced increase in extracellular glucose and glycogenolysis but did not alter MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The present results suggest that MDMA increases extracellular glucose in multiple brain regions, and that this response involves both serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms. Furthermore, beta-adrenergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors appear to contribute to MDMA-induced glycogenolysis and hyperthermia, respectively. Finally, hyperthermia, glycogenolysis and elevated extracellular glucose appear to be independent, unrelated responses to acute MDMA administration.",

Although the first large studies failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in mortality, the results from subsequent studies revealed significant risk reductions in mortality with metoprolol, carvedilol and bisoprolol. Decision of the appropriate therapeutic agent depends on the existence of some specific conditions complicating dilated cardiomyopathy. This article reviews the impact of beta-blocker therapy in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology.", 
    "37": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a condition most prevalent in postmenopausal women, characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction following acute emotional or physical stress. Direct catecholamine-mediated myocyte injury and microvascular dysfunction leading to myocardial stunning are believed to play a major role in its pathogenesis. The treatment of TC remains empirical. In the acute phase, therapy must be individualized depending on hemodynamic situation. In stable conditions, it appears advantageous to prevent excessive sympathetic activation by combining alpha and beta blockade. Beta blockers are used to treat dynamic left ventricular obstruction. Phenylephrine may represent an alternative approach in patients presenting with outflow tract obstruction and severe hypotension. In hemodynamically unstable patients, early administration of intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation should be considered. As no consensus currently exists with respect to the chronic management of TC, randomized clinical trials are urgently needed with focus on treatment strategies.",

Recent data have shown less optimal reductions in total mortality, CVD mortality, and CVD events with beta-blockers compared with renin-angiotensin system-blocking agents or calcium channel blockers. The beta-blocker class, however, spans a wide range of agents, and the growing concern about the risk-benefit profile of beta-blockers should not be generalized to later-generation vasodilating beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol. A growing database from hypertension studies confirms the clinical efficacy and safety of vasodilating beta-blockers, and outcome studies indicate that these agents can play an important role in global CVD reduction in patients with hypertensive or ischemic heart failure.", 
    "39": "In the United States, a vast segment of the adult population is classified as having the cardiometabolic syndrome, and currently there are epidemic rates of both type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Hypertension is closely linked with these metabolic disorders and is a strong independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes. In addition, hypertension is an important contributor to increasing cardiovascular disease risk in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome. Lowering elevated blood pressure in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome or diabetes is a critical component of reducing global cardiovascular risk. However, aggressive management of hypertension in these patients is often challenging, and the presence of these conditions is associated with poor blood pressure control. The utility of beta-blockers in patients with these conditions continues to be a subject of intense debate, given the adverse metabolic effects associated with conventional beta-blockers. Data on vasodilating beta-blockers, however, suggest that these agents have favorable or neutral metabolic effects and generally more favorable effects when compared with nonvasodilating members of this class. These agents may expand the utility of beta-blockers to patient populations traditionally considered not to be optimal candidates for beta-blocker therapy-a fact which has important clinical implications, because more antihypertensive agents are needed to diversify the therapeutic options available for clinicians treating hypertension in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes.", 
    "40": "Although beta-blockers have been endorsed by guidelines committees for the treatment of patients with hypertension, particularly those with significant CVD and high CVD risk, there are concerns about conventional beta-blockers related to poorer clinical outcomes compared with other classes of antihypertensive agents, as well as deleterious effects on quality of life and lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. beta-Blockers comprise a heterogeneous group of antihypertensive agents, including nonselective agents, cardioselective, nonvasodilating agents, and vasodilating agents that either combine beta-nonselectivity with alpha-blockade or possess cardioselectivity without alpha-blockade. The pharmacologic, mechanistic, and hemodynamic differences between conventional, nonvasodilating beta-blockers and vasodilating beta-blockers are discussed in this review, with a focus on the cardioselective vasodilating beta-blocker nebivolol. These differences may have important clinical implications, particularly in the treatment of complicated hypertension, such as that associated with patients with diabetes or the cardiometabolic syndrome, elderly patients, and African American patients, suggesting that mechanism of action may be an important consideration when choosing a beta-blocker.", 
    "41": "Despite their proven mortality and morbidity outcomes benefits, beta-blockers remain substantially underused in patients with cardiac conditions. Reluctance to prescribe beta-blockers may be owing to concerns about tolerability with the traditional drugs in this class. Beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties, such as carvedilol and nebivolol, may overcome the tolerability and metabolic issues associated with traditional beta-blockers. Because endothelial dysfunction, the pathophysiologic hallmark of hypertension, may be heightened in populations with difficult-to-treat hypertension (e.g., elderly patients, African American patients), a vasodilating beta-blocker may be a particularly appropriate choice for these patient groups.",

The success rate of iv cibenzoline therapy (47%) was significantly greater than that of iv disopyramide therapy (24%; P<0.05). To identify clinical factors to increase the termination efficacy of iv cibenzoline, multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for several covariates and to generate adjusted odds ratios (OR). The significant variables for the termination of paroxysmal AF after iv cibenzoline therapy were pretreatment with oral beta-adrenergic blockers (OR =8.224, P=0.030) and smaller left atrial dimensions (OR =0.879, P=0.039).",

    "45": "The cerebellum consists of parasagittal zones that define fundamental modules of neural processing. Each zone receives input from a distinct subdivision of the inferior olive (IO)-activity in one olivary subdivision will affect activity in one cerebellar module. To define functions of the cerebellar modules, we inactivated specific olivary subdivisions in six male cats with a glutamate receptor blocker. Olivary inactivation eliminates Purkinje cell complex spikes, which results in a high rate of Purkinje cell simple spike discharge. The increased simple spike discharge inhibits output from connected regions of the cerebellar nuclei. After inactivation, behavior was evaluated during a reach-to-grasp task and during locomotion. Inactivation of each subdivision produced unique behavioral deficits. Performance of the reach-to-grasp task was affected by inactivation of the rostral dorsal accessory olive (rDAO) and the rostral medial accessory olive (rMAO) and, possibly, the principal olive. rDAO inactivation produced paw drag during locomotion and a deficit in grasping the handle during the reach-to-grasp task. rMAO inactivation caused the cats to reach under the handle and produced severe limb drag during locomotion. Inactivation of the dorsal medial cell column, cell group beta, or caudal medial accessory olive produced little deficit in the reach-to-grasp task, but each produced a different deficit during locomotion. In all cases, the cats appeared to have intact sensation, good spatial awareness, and no change of affect. Normal cerebellar function requires low rates of IO discharge, and each cerebellar module has a specific and unique function in sensory-motor integration.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, administration on cutaneous wound healing of chronically stressed mice. Male mice were spun at 115 rpm for 15 min every hour from three days before wounding until euthanasia. Control animals were not submitted to stress. Stressed and control animals were treated with propranolol dissolved in water; controls received only water. Propranolol administration began one day before wounding and was continued daily until euthanasia. A full-thickness excisional lesion was performed. Seven and fourteen days later, animals were killed, and lesions were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunostained against F4/80 to quantify macrophages, alpha-smooth muscle actin to quantify the myofibroblast density and proliferating cell nuclear antigen to quantify the cell proliferation. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity, nitrite and hydroxyproline levels and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression were measured in wound. Stress and control + propranolol groups presented a delay in wound contraction, re-epithelialization, F4/80-positive macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells infiltration, cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, myofibroblastic differentiation, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation and TNF-alpha expression, whereas an increase in the nitrite levels. Stress + propranolol group presented results similar to control group. In conclusion, stress impairs cutaneous wound healing in mice through beta1- adrenoceptors and beta2-adrenoceptors activation.",

The bone anabolic potential of IGF-I and parathyroid hormone-related protein is discussed in the light of animal data and human studies. We also discuss the use of antagonists of the calcium-sensing receptor (calcilytics) as orally administered small molecules capable of transiently elevating serum parathyroid hormone (PTH). Further, we reviewed novel anabolic agents targeting members of the wingless tail (Wnt) signaling family that regulate bone formation including DKK-1, sclerostin, Thp1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta. We have also followed up on the promise shown by beta-blockers in modulating the activity of sympathetic nervous system, thus affecting bone anabolism. We give critical consideration to neutralizing the activity of activin A, a negative regulator of bone mass by soluble activin receptor IIA, as a strategy to promote bone formation.",

The drug was subjected to stress conditions of hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis, and thermal decomposition. Extensive degradation was found to occur in an alkaline medium and under thermal stress. Minimum degradation was observed in an acidic medium and under photolytic and oxidative stress. Successful separation of the drug from its degradation products formed under stress conditions was achieved on a C18 column using sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer-acetonitrile (70 + 30) mobile phase. The flow rate was 1 mL/min, and the detection wavelength was 274 nm. The method was validated for linearity, range, precision, accuracy, LOQ, and LOD. Because the method effectively separates the drugs from their degradation products, it can be used as a stability-indicating method.",

Irradiation of AL in solid form with a 25 kGy beam of electrons caused only an insignificant change in color that became more intense with increasing irradiation dose. Moreover, with increasing dose a decrease in pH, the content of water, and the degree of crystallinity were observed. AL in solid form was radiated with a high-energy electron beam (9.96 MeV) at doses from 25-400 kGy and analyzed by HPTLC using the mobile phase methanol-ammonia 25% (99 + 1, v/v). Densitometric analysis was carried out directly from chromatograms at 270 nm. The applied method was validated and characterized by good precision (RSD = 3.95%); good accuracy (80% level 100.15%, 100% level 99.99%, and 120% level 104.44%); and low LOD (LOD = 0.52 microg/zone and LOQ = 1.55 microg/zone). Chromatograms recorded for samples irradiated at the doses of 25 kGy were unchanged, but at higher doses (100-400 kGy) additional peaks corresponding to the radiodegradation products appeared (Rf = 0.24 and Rf = 0.40). The decrease in the concentration of AL was proportional to the applied radiation dose, and for 400 kGy the concentration of AL was 90.23%. The calculated radiolytic yield of the radiodegradation process was G(-AL) = 7.12 x 10(-7) mol/J.", 
    "53": "Early cardiovascular disease starts in the endothelium leading to functional changes in the vasculature. These changes can be depicted by assessment of arterial stiffness or elasticity. There are several techniques to assess arterial stiffness. Increased arterial stiffness or decreased arterial elasticity has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors. There is now evidence that small artery elasticity is a strong predictor for arterial hypertension. Moreover arterial elasticity provides extra prognostic information beyond arterial blood pressure measurement. Arterial stiffness attenuation may reflect the true reduction of arterial wall damage.",

    "57": "Inbred mouse strains play a critical role in biomedical research. Genetic homogeneity within inbred strains and their general amenability to genetic manipulation have made them an ideal resource for dissecting the physiological function(s) of individual genes. However, the inbreeding that makes inbred mice so useful also results in genetic divergence between them. This genetic divergence is often unaccounted for but may be a confounding factor when comparing studies that have utilized distinct inbred strains. Here, we compared the cardiac function of C57BL/6J mice to seven other commonly used inbred mouse strains: FVB/NJ, DBA/2J, C3H/HeJ, BALB/cJ, 129X1/SvJ, C57BL/10SnJ, and 129S1/SvImJ. The assays used to compare cardiac function were the ex vivo isolated Langendorff heart preparation and in vivo real-time hemodynamic analysis using conductance micromanometry. We report significant strain-dependent differences in cardiac function between C57BL/6J and other commonly used inbred strains. C57BL/6J maintained better cardiac function than most inbred strains after ex vivo ischemia, particularly compared with 129S1/SvImJ, 129X1/SvJ, and C57BL/10SnJ strains. However, during in vivo acute hypoxia 129X1/SvJ and 129S1/SvImJ maintained relatively normal cardiac function, whereas C57BL/6J animals showed dramatic cardiac decompensation. Additionally, C3H/HeJ showed rapid and marked cardiac decompensation in response to esmolol infusion compared with effects of other strains. These findings demonstrate the complex effects of genetic divergence between inbred strains on cardiac function. These results may help inform analysis of gene ablation or transgenic studies and further demonstrate specific quantitative traits that could be useful in discovery of genetic modifiers relevant to cardiac health and disease.", 
    "58": "1. The aims of the present study were to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying the protective effect of carvedilol against neural damage. 2. The transient inactivating potassium current (I(A) ) and the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(K) ) in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques. 3. Carvedilol (0.1-3 \u03bcmol/L) significantly inhibited I(K) with an IC(50) of 1.3 \u03bcmol/L and the inhibition was voltage independent. Over the same concentration range, carvedilol had no effect on the amplitude of I(A). At 1 \u03bcmol/L, carvedilol did not significantly change the steady state activation curves of I(A) and I(K), but did negatively shift their steady state inactivation curves. Recovery from inactivation was slowed for both I(A) and I(K). The inhibitory effect of carvedilol on I(K) was not affected by the adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and prazosin or the adrenoceptor antagonist isoproterenol, but propranolol was able to shift the dose-response curve of carvedilol for I(K) to the right. 4. Because I(K) is the main pathway for loss of intracellular potassium from depolarized neurons, selective obstruction of I(K) by carvedilol could be useful for neuroprotection.",

According to the previous recommendations beta-blockers should not be preferred as first-line therapy in hypertension patients.

The aim of our work was to describe methodology of subtotal surgical renal ablation in rat and to characterize some biochemical and cardiovascular parameters of this animal model. Male rats underwent 5/6 surgical nephrectomy or sham operations in two steps. The following parameters were measured on day 10 and in week 10 after the surgery: plasma concentrations of creatinine and urea, blood pressure, resting heart rate, chronotropic response to atropine and metipranol, heart ventricles weight, contraction parameters and action potential duration in the left ventricle. Increased serum concentrations of creatinine and urea, decreased creatinine clearance, polyuria and alteration of the remnant kidney tissue were found in CRF rats. Changes in cardiovascular parameters identified after subtotal nephrectomy resembled alterations of cardiovascular system in uremic patients and included hypertension, elevated resting heart rate, diminished parasympathetic cardiac tone, hypertrophy of the left ventricle associated with weakened force of contraction, prolonged contraction and relaxation and shortening of action potential duration. These data suggest that the present model can be a useful tool in the study of CRF and its cardiovascular complications.",

The focus of OU management involves an assessment of the factors that led to the decompensation and identification of the predominant clinical features such as hypertension and congestion. Acute therapy still leans heavily on symptom relief with diuretics and nitroglycerin.

Reperfusion in placebo groups was associated with aging-related changes in the ischemic zones in markers of damage (increased ischemic injury, infarct size [as percent risk], cardiomyocyte apoptosis, blood flow impairment, no reflow), structural remodeling (increased left ventricular dilation and dysfunction), extracellular matrix remodeling (increased expression of secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, osteopontin, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-10 and -17, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and -2), and inflammation (increased inducible nitric oxide synthase, proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta(1); decreased antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10).

However, questions still remain on the behavior of antigen presenting cells (APC) dictated by stress-induced sympathetic neurotransmitters. The purpose of this study was to examine the fate of bone marrow-derived dendritic cell (BMDC)-associated influences on resting CD4(+) T cell activation. We hypothesize that pre-exposure of dendritic cells (DCs) can modify the intensity of cytokine production, leading to preference in resting CD4(+) T cell activation. BMDCs were pre-treated with epinephrine for 2h followed by subsequent treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Subsequently, BMDCs were cocultured with purified CD4(+) T cells from mouse spleen in the absence or presence of anti-CD3 stimulation in epinephrine-free media. Epinephrine pre-treatment enhanced surface expression of MHCII, CD80 and CD86. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that epinephrine pre-treatment induced a significant transcriptional decrease of IL-12p40 and a significant increase of IL-12p35 and IL-23p19. In addition, \u03b22-adrenergic-blockade was shown to reverse these effects. Epinephrine pre-treatment also induced a significant decrease of IL-12p70 and a significant increase of IL-23 and IL-10 cytokine production. Importantly, these changes corresponded with increased IL-4 and IL-17A, but not IFN-g cytokine production by CD4(+) T cells in a b2-adrenergic receptor-dependent manner. These results suggest that exposure to stress-derived epinephrine dictates dendritic cells to generate a dominant Th2/Th17 phenotype in the context of subsequent exposure to a pathogenic stimulus.",

Diabetes was induced in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal STZ injection. Diabetic rats were treated for 1 week with losartan (20 mg/kg/body weight/day in the drinking water), and pancreas and blood were collected for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical studies. Diabetic rats showed greater VEGF, sICAM-1, NO, and MDA levels, a high score of insulitis, increased nitrotyrosine staining, and markedly reduced pancreatic insulin content when compared with controls. Losartan treatment suppressed the excessive NO and lipid peroxidation production systemically without restoring them to that of healthy subjects and reduced VEGF levels while leaving sICAM-1 levels unchanged. The insulitis score and nitrotyrosine staining were reduced, whereas the pancreatic islets and the beta-cell area were increased significantly in the treated group, indicating the reduction of inflammation and nitrosative stress and an early regeneration of beta-cell mass in the pancreas. Conclusively, in the STZ diabetic rat model, even a short-term losartan treatment improves oxidative and nitrosative stress systemically and locally, improving the islets' environment and accelerating beta-cell regeneration.",

However, the pharmacological family of beta-blockers is inhomogeneous regarding their pharmacological properties and their clinical effects can differ substantially according to different pharmacological properties. Because of vasodilator effects, the third generation of beta-blockers has additional potential across the cardiovascular diseases, from hypertension to heart failure. Nebivololol has both high selectivity for beta1-adrenergic receptors, no intrinsic sympathetic activity and ability to stimulate endothelial nitric oxide production. Such properties result in specific hemodynamic effects compared with others beta-blockers. Such properties also result in both high tolerability and positive metabolic effects which are crucial in high-risk groups. In the SENIORS trial, nebivolol demonstrated its efficacy and high tolerability in elderly patients with chronic heart failure irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction. More clinical trials would be useful to exhibit specific benefits of nebivolol in other high-risk groups of patients.",

Its image of old-fashioned drug in the mind of young cardiology generations appears widely distorted, and suffers from the absence of promotion by pharmaceutical industry, given a very low cost and a rapid arrival onto the generic market. Yet, regarding strict data from the literature, it remains a lot of positive factors in favor of the interest for digoxin: reduction of morbidity, reduction of mortality at low serum concentration <1.0 ng/ml, very low cost with favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.

We investigated the role of noradrenergic modulation in the MOB on odor detection and discrimination thresholds using behavioral and computational modeling approaches. Adult rats received bilateral MOB injections of vehicle, NE (0.1-1000 microM), noradrenergic receptor antagonists and NE + receptor antagonists combined. NE infusion improved odor detection and discrimination as a function of NE and odor concentration. The effect of NE on detection and discrimination magnitude at any given odor concentration varied in a non-linear function with respect to NE concentration. Receptor antagonist infusion demonstrated that alpha1 receptor activation is necessary for the modulatory effect of NE. Computational modeling showed that increases in the strength of alpha1 receptor activation leads to improved odor signal-to-noise ratio and spike synchronization in mitral cells that may underlie the behaviorally observed decrease of detection and discrimination thresholds. Our results are the first to show that direct infusion of NE or noradrenergic receptor antagonists into a primary sensory network modulates sensory detection and discrimination thresholds at very low stimulus concentrations.",

However, the mechanism by which it causes this dramatic effect is unknown, the dosage empirical and the optimal duration of treatment unexplored. This study determines the minimal dosage and duration of propranolol treatment to achieve accelerated involution of problematic infantile haemangioma. Consecutive patients with problematic proliferating infantile haemangioma treated with propranolol were culled from our prospective vascular anomalies database. The patients were initially managed as inpatients and commenced on propranolol at 0.25 mg kg(-1) twice daily, and closely monitored. The dosage was increased to 0.5 mg kg(-1) twice daily after 24 h, if there was no cardiovascular or metabolic side effect. The dosage was increased further by 0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) until a visible effect was noticed or up to a maximum of 2 mg kg(-1) day(-1), and was maintained until the lesion had fully involuted or the child was 12-months old. A total of 15 patients aged 3 weeks to 8.5 months (mean, 11 weeks) underwent propranolol treatment for problematic proliferating infantile haemangioma, which threatened life (n=1) or vision (n=2) or nasal obstruction (n=3) and/or caused ulceration (n=6) and/or bleeding (n=2) and/or significant tissue distortion (n=12). The minimal dosage required to achieve accelerated involution was 1.5-2.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Rebound growth occurred in the first patient when the dose was withdrawn at 7.5 months of age requiring reinstitution of treatment. No rebound growth was observed in the remaining patients. No other complications were observed. Propranolol at 1.5-2.0 mg kg(-1) day(-1), administered in divided doses with gradual increase in the dose, is effective and safe for treating problematic proliferating infantile haemangioma in our cohort of patients. Treatment should be maintained until the lesion is completely involuted or the child is 12-months old.

    "121": "The investigations reported here were designed to gain insights into the role of 3-monoiodothyronamine (T1AM) in the brain, where the amine was originally identified and characterized. Extensive deiodinase studies indicated that T1AM was derived from the T4 metabolite, reverse triiodothyronine (revT3), while functional studies provided well-confirmed evidence that T1AM has strong adrenergic-blocking effects. Because a state of adrenergic overactivity prevails when triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations become excessive, the possibility that T3's metabolic partner, revT3, might give rise to an antagonist of those T3 actions was thought to be reasonable. All T1AM studies thus far have required use of pharmacological doses. Therefore we considered that choosing a physiological site of action was a priority and focused on the locus coeruleus (LC), the major noradrenergic control center in the brain. Site-directed injections of T1AM into the LC elicited a significant, dose-dependent neuronal firing rate change in a subset of adrenergic neurons with an EC(50)=2.7 microM, a dose well within the physiological range. Further evidence for its physiological actions came from autoradiographic images obtained following intravenous carrier-free (125)I-labeled T1AM injection. These showed that the amine bound with high affinity to the LC and to other selected brain nuclei, each of which is both an LC target and a known T3 binding site. This new evidence points to a physiological role for T1AM as an endogenous adrenergic-blocking neuromodulator in the central noradrenergic system.",

Today the approach to SCD prevention includes considering both the setting of patients who have already presented a cardiac arrest or a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias (secondary prevention of SCD) and the much broader setting of primary prevention in patients at variable degrees of identifiable risk. For secondary prevention of SCD, implantable cardioverter defibrillation is now the standard of care (the risk of overall mortality may be reduced by 20-31%), and anti-arrhythmic agents, specifically amiodarone, have only a complementary role (for reducing device activations or for preventing atrial fibrillation). For primary prevention of SCD in high-risk patients, cardioverter defibrillators have nowadays specific indications in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (often in combination with cardiac resynchronization therapy), where the risk of overall mortality may be reduced by 23-54%. For the large number of subjects who have some risk of SCD, but are not identified as at high risk of SCD, a series of drugs could exert a favorable effect (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker agents, statins, omega-3 fatty acids and aldosterone antagonists), and for some of them evidence is emerging, from subgroup analysis, of possible SCD prevention capabilities.",

It was found that amoxicillin (in the whole pH range 3-12), and naproxen (in the low pH range 2-4) presented high reaction rates, while naproxen (in the pH range 5-9), and phenacetin and metoprolol (in the pH range 2.5-12 for phenacetin, and 3-10 for metoprolol) followed intermediate and slow reaction rates. A mechanism is proposed for the chlorination reaction, which allowed the evaluation of the intrinsic rate constants for the elementary reactions of the ionized and un-ionized species of each selected pharmaceutical with chlorine. An excellent agreement is obtained between experimental and calculated rate constants by this mechanism.The elimination of these substances in several waters (a groundwater, a surface water from a public reservoir, and two effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants) was also investigated at neutral pH. The efficiency of the chlorination process with respect to the pharmaceuticals elimination and the formation THMs was also established. It is generally observed that the increasing presence of organic and inorganic matter in the water matrices demand more oxidant agent (chlorine), and therefore, less chlorine is available for the oxidation of these compounds. Finally, half-life times and oxidant exposures (CT) required for the removal of 99% of the four pharmaceuticals are also evaluated. These parameters are useful for the establishment of safety chlorine doses in oxidation or disinfection stages of pharmaceuticals in treatment plants.", 
    "148": "The aim of this work was to determine the frequency and nature of oral manifestations secondary to use of cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "149": "Five hundred and thirty one patients attending an adult cardiology clinic in Saudi Arabia were questioned about the occurrence of oral dryness, dysgeusia, or burning sensation and were clinically evaluated for the presence of oral mucosal or gingival disease. Data were statistically analyzed with chi-squared tests, odds ratios and Student's t-test.", 
    "150": "Oral symptoms and/or signs were recorded in 75 (14.1%) patients with xerostomia being the most common (7.5%), followed by lichenoid (lichen planus-like) lesions (3.6%) and dysgeusia (1.9%). Xerostomia was significantly more frequent in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus and in female patients (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) between patients with or without oral manifestations when age, gender, cardiovascular risk factor, cardiac disease, type of cardiac drug used or the number of medications were assessed. There was a trend for xerostomia to be less frequent in patients receiving therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and a slight trend of xerostomia to be more likely with increased number of non-cardiac and total number of agents per subject. The number of non-cardiac and total medications taken by patients with potential oral manifestations tended to be greater than that of patients without oral manifestations.", 
    "151": "The frequency of potential oral manifestations in patients receiving cardiovascular agents was 14.1%. The occurrence and character of the oral manifestations had no significant relation with individual cardiac drugs, although there was a trend for oral manifestations to be likely with increasing number of drugs.", 
    "152": "Propranolol has recently been reported to be useful in the treatment of infantile hemangiomas. However, there are still many questions regarding the dosage, duration, and method of delivery.", 
    "153": "In this retrospective, observational case series, all patients had complete eye examinations and were found to have vision-threatening hemangiomas. All patients had a baseline electrocardiogram. Outpatient, oral propranolol therapy was initiated between 3 weeks and 12 months of age. The dosage was slowly increased to 2 mg/kg daily over the course of 1-2 weeks. Response to therapy was deemed \"excellent\" (>50% reduction in size), \"good\" (decreased size but <50%), \"fair\" (no further growth), or \"poor\" (continued growth or intolerable adverse effects).", 
    "154": "A total of 17 patients were treated with oral therapy. Of these, 10 had excellent results, 6 had a good response, 1 fair, and none poor. Mild adverse effects were noted in 6 of the 17 patients and included the following: increased gastric reflux lasting 1 week, intermittent fatigue during the first 2 weeks, gastrointestinal upset, and slight \"shakiness\" with a missed dose. No symptoms were severe enough to discontinue treatment. All families were satisfied with the treatment.", 
    "155": "Outpatient propranolol treatment reduced the size or stopped the growth of all hemangiomas treated, with excellent response in more than half of all patients treated and only minor side effects. Although this is a small initial series, we are encouraged with the efficacy of this treatment modality in comparison with other currently available treatment options.", 
    "156": "Estrogen plays a cardioprotective role in female rat hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion injury. The its effects are, at least partially, associated with decreased cardiomyocyte contraction and increased expression of beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR). We tested whether beta(2)-AR could be involved in cardioprotection against ischemic damage and whether the roles of beta(2)-AR were dependent on estrogenic environment. We first determined the effects of hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) on cardiomyocyte shortening in female rats. We then determined the roles of beta(2)-AR in cardiomyocyte shortening, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in culture medium, and cell death during hypoxia in isolated myocytes from female rats. We further determined the effects of estrogen on the roles of beta(2)-AR during hypoxia. H/R induced short-term hibernation and stunning at the level of ventricular myocytes from normal female rats. Inhibition of beta(2)-AR with ICI118,551 significantly elevated adrenergic contractile reserve, myocardial injury, and cell death in normal female rats during hypoxia, whereas ovariectomy (OVX) prominently enhanced myocyte contraction, myocardial injury, and cell death, and deprived the alternations in normal female rats. These changes were restored to normal by estrogen replacement (OVX+E(2)). These data suggest that beta(2)-AR may be involved in the cardioprotection against ischemic damage, and the cardioprotection may depend on estrogenic environment.", 
    "157": "beta-Adrenoceptor-blocking agents have been used for perioperative management during anaesthesia, in which selective beta1-blockers are advantageous over nonselective beta-blockers. Apart from the different affinity for beta-adrenoceptors, beta1-blockers were differentially characterized in light of their different interaction with lipid membranes.", 
    "158": "Selective (atenolol, metoprolol and esmolol) and nonselective (alprenolol, oxprenolol and propranolol) beta1-blockers were reacted at 0.2-1 mmol l with 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes and biomimetic membranes consisting of phospholipids, sphingolipid and cholesterol. Their membrane interactivities were comparatively determined using the potency to modify membrane fluidity by measuring fluorescence polarization. Their relative hydrophobicities were evaluated by reversed-phase liquid chromatography.", 
    "159": "The chromatographic evaluation divided the tested drugs into more hydrophobic ones containing nonselective beta-blockers and less hydrophobic ones containing selective beta1-blockers. Nonselective beta-blockers, but not selective beta1-blockers, fluidized liposomal membranes, with the potency being oxprenolol < alprenolol < propranolol. Membrane-active alprenolol preferentially acted on the hydrophobic deeper regions of phospholipid bilayers. The potency of nonselective beta-blockers to fluidize biomimetic membranes was greatest in propranolol, followed by alprenolol and oxprenolol, whereas all selective beta1-blockers were inactive.", 
    "160": "The membrane-fluidizing effects of beta-blockers are correlated with their relative hydrophobicities and their respective conformations to perturb the alignment of phospholipid acyl chains. The membrane-interacting characteristics differentiate beta-blockers as nonselective propranolol, alprenolol and oxprenolol vs. beta1-selective atenolol, metoprolol and esmolol. Such differentiation reflects not only the structural difference but also the beta-adrenoceptor-blocking difference. The membrane fluidization may be partly responsible for the nonselective blockade of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "161": "Advances have been made in the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of vascular tumors of infancy in the past year. Propranolol therapy for infantile hemangiomas (IH) is now being used widely, and case reports, series, and adverse effects are reviewed. Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma and tufted angioma are less common than IH but more often associated with coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon).", 
    "162": "Recent work suggests that stem cells, mediated by the Notch signaling pathway, may become proliferating endothelial cells that comprise IH. Large, segmental IH are more likely to develop complications that can include life-threatening bleeds; however, solitary large IH do not appear to increase the risk of hepatic IH. Segmental IH may herald underlying structural anomalies of the brain, cerebral, and cardiac vessels (PHACE syndrome--Posterior fossa defects, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects and Coarctation of the aorta, Eye anomalies), and new criteria aid in diagnosis. Propranolol therapy is effective in life-threatening IH and appears to stop growth and hasten involution in proliferative and plateau phase IH. Adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, hypoglycemia, and bronchospasm. A recent review of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma finds that an associated coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon) occurs in 72%.", 
    "163": "Propranolol appears to be tremendously efficacious with fewer side effects than systemic corticosteroids, but its proper place in the therapeutic algorithm for IH and other vascular tumors awaits controlled study.", 
    "164": "Adrenal gland hormones have been shown to have a role in the antiinflammatory effect mechanism of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. This study investigates whether the analgesic effects of indomethacin, diclofenac sodium, aspirin, and nimesulide (IDAN; upper case letters of the four drugs we used) are also related to adrenal gland hormones.", 
    "165": "The analgesic effects of IDAN were studied in the carrageenan-induced inflammatory pain model using both intact and adrenalectomized rats. Paw withdrawal tests were performed in adrenalectomized rats that had been pretreated with phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, and metoprolol.", 
    "166": "This study was performed in Pharmacology and Biochemistry Laboratories of Faculty of Medicine.",

    "168": "Adrernalectomy, drug administrations, pain model induction and pain threshold measurements were performed during the study.", 
    "169": "Although the analgesic effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs were lost in adrenalectomized rats, they exerted significant analgesia in adrenalectomized rats that had been pretreated with prednisolone and adrenalin. All these drugs were found to decrease serum adrenalin concentration but did not change serum cortisole (corticosterone in rats) concentration. Prednisolone and adrenalin inhibited carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia in adrenalectomized rat groups pretreated with metoprolol or phenoxybenzamine, but not in rats given propranolol. Propranolol also negated the analgesic effects of IDAN in intact rats. The analgesic effects provided by either prednisolone or adrenalin could not be inhibited by the alpha1, alpha2, or beta1 blockers but disappeared when beta2 receptors were blocked.", 
    "170": "The analgesic effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs appear to be related to endogenous adrenalin and cortisole. We have demonstrated that adrenalin and prednisolone play important roles in the analgesic effect mechanism of IDAN. Prednisolone and adrenalin produce analgesic effects through beta2-adrenergic receptors, suggesting an indirect role for beta2-adrenergic receptors in the analgesic effect mechanism of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs mentioned.", 
    "171": "Although higher heart rate (HR) at baseline has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality, the relationship of in-treatment HR over time to mortality in hypertensive patients with ECG left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has not been examined.", 
    "172": "Heart rate was evaluated over time in 9190 hypertensive patients treated with losartan- or atenolol-based regimens and followed with annual ECGs. During a mean follow-up of 4.8 \u00b1 0.9 years, 814 patients (8.9%) died, 438 (4.8%) from CV causes. In univariate Cox analyses, every 10 bpm higher HR on in-treatment ECGs was associated with a 25% increased risk of CV death [95% confidence interval (CI): 14-32%] and a 27% greater risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 21-34%). In an alternative analysis, persistence or development of a HR \u2265 84 bpm (upper quintile of baseline HR) was associated with an 89% greater risk of CV death (95% CI: 49-141%) and a 97% increased risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 65-135%). After adjusting for treatment with losartan vs. atenolol, baseline risk factors for death, baseline HR, baseline and in-treatment systolic and diastolic pressure, incident myocardial infarction, and the known predictive value of baseline and in-treatment QRS duration and ECG LVH, higher in-treatment HR in time-varying multivariable Cox models remained strongly predictive of mortality: every 10 bpm higher HR was associated with a 16% increased adjusted risk of CV mortality (95% CI: 6-27%) and a 25% greater risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 17-33%), with persistence or development of a HR \u2265 84 associated with a 55% greater risk of CV death (95% CI: 16-105%) and a 79% greater adjusted risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI: 46-121%).", 
    "173": "Higher in-treatment HR on serial ECGs predicts greater likelihood of subsequent CV or all-cause mortality, independent of treatment modality, blood pressure lowering, regression of ECG LVH and changing QRS duration in hypertensive patients with ECG LVH. These findings support the value of serial assessment of HR for improved risk stratification in hypertensive patients.",

    "175": "Responses and functions of airway epithelial cells are stimulated by \u03b2\u2082-agonists via the \u03b2\u2082-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2\u2082-ARs)-G(s)-protein-cAMP-system, thus, affecting airway inflammation such as in asthma and equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). Though horses can be used as large animal model for human asthma, evaluation of the expression and functions of the \u03b2-AR system in primary equine airway epithelial cells has not been yet carried out. Thus, for the first time, we determined the \u03b2-AR density and subtype distribution by [\u00b9\u00b2\u2075I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding, examined \u03b2-AR function by cAMP assay as well as their expression by western blot analysis and immunocytochemical staining in primary equine tracheal epithelial cells (ETEC). Cells were collected from 19 horses and cultured subsequently. The specific ICYP binding was saturable and of high affinity: in freshly isolated cells the receptor density (B(max)) and ICYP affinity (K(D)) for \u03b2-ARs were 12727 \u00b1 883 binding sites/cell and 31.78 \u00b1 6.57 pM, respectively, and in cultured ETEC 3730 \u00b1 212 binding sites/cell and 15.26 \u00b1 3.37 pM, respectively. The \u03b2-AR subtype assessed by \u03b2\u2081-selective (CGP 20712A) and \u03b2\u2082-selective (ICI 118.551) adrenergic receptor antagonists demonstrated that the \u03b2\u2082-AR subtype predominated (>95%) in both cell populations (p < 0.001). The \u03b2-AR agonists increased cAMP formation with a rank order of potency: isoproterenol > epinephrine > norepinephrine. ICI 118.551 (100 nM) significantly blocked (p < 0.05) isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation but not CGP 20712A (300 nM). Western blot analyses and immunocytochemical staining further indicated the expression of the \u03b2(2)-AR subtype in both cell preparations. Our data indicate that in acutely dissociated and primary cultured ETEC the \u03b2(2)-AR-AC system is expressed, but varies considerably between the two preparations.", 
    "176": "The presence of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BK) channels, which are considered to play an important role in the excitability of neurons, in the highly-excitable lateral globus pallidus (LGP) neurons has yet to be confirmed. In this study, we confirmed the functional expression of BK channels in mouse LGP neurons and investigated the characteristics of their single-channel currents using inside-out patch-clamp recordings. These BK channels had a conductance of 276 pS, were activated by the elevation of both the transmembrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), and were completely blocked by the BK channel-specific blocker paxilline (100 nM). In addition, the channel currents were sensitive to high-energy phosphate compounds and low internal pH. The cellular function of these BK channels was then investigated by nystatin-perforated whole-cell recording. Paxilline (100 nM) had no effect on the frequency and half-width of the action potential (AP) in LGP neurons under control conditions, but significantly attenuated the hyperpolarization that was caused by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), an inhibitor of ATP synthesis. In addition, the pancreatic beta-cell type ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K(ATP) channel) blocker tolbutamide (0.25 mM) also attenuated the hyperpolarization, in a manner similar to paxilline. The voltage-dependent potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA, 2 mM) significantly decreased the frequency and increased the half-width of the AP in LGP neurons under control conditions, and attenuated CCCP-induced hyperpolarization to an extent close to that of paxilline. The results presented here suggest that functional BK channels are present in LGP neurons, and may behave as partners of K(ATP) channels in the regulation of neuronal activity under metabolic stress conditions.", 
    "177": "Neurotensin is known to have antipsychotic-like behavioral and neurochemical effects, but its participation in fear memory has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report that a lack of type 1 neurotensin receptor (Ntsr1) increases the behavioral fear response elicited by weak fear memory. Adult Ntsr1-knockout (KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates were compared in contextual fear conditioning. The mice were exposed twice for 3min to the context 24 and 48h after conditioning (first and second exposure, respectively), and freezing response of mice at the exposure was measured to evaluate fear memory. Ntsr1-KO mice showed a higher freezing rate than WT mice at both first and second exposures under the condition where a relatively weak unconditioned stimulus (footshock) was applied and thus elicited a relatively lower freezing rate. The difference in the first exposure between Ntsr1-KO and WT mice disappeared under the condition where a more intense unconditioned stimulus was used. The enhancement of freezing response in Ntsr1-KO mice at second exposure was abolished by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker that suppresses fear memory reconsolidation, and suppressed by MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist. These results suggest that Ntsr1 plays inhibitory roles in weak fear memory.", 
    "178": "There is a growing body of evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE) interaction evokes oxidative stress generation and subsequently elicits inflammatory and fibrogenic reactions, thereby contributing to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. We have previously found that nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the AGE-induced mesangial cell damage in vitro. However, effects of nifedipine on proximal tubular cell injury remain unknown. We examined here whether and how nifedipine blocked the AGE-induced tubular cell damage. Nifedipine, but not amlodipine, a control CCB, inhibited the AGE-induced up-regulation of RAGE mRNA levels in tubular cells, which was prevented by the simultaneous treatment of GW9662, an inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). GW9662 treatment alone was found to increase RAGE mRNA levels in tubular cells. Further, nifedipine inhibited the AGE-induced reactive oxygen species generation, NF-kappaB activation and increases in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and transforming growth factor-beta gene expression in tubular cells, all of which were blocked by GW9662. Our present study provides a unique beneficial aspect of nifedipine on diabetic nephropathy; it could work as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agent against AGEs in tubular cells by suppressing RAGE expression via PPARgamma activation.", 
    "179": "Bicomponent fibers of two semi-crystalline (co)polymers, poly(varepsilon-caprolactone), and poly(oxyethylene-b-oxypropylene-b-oxyethylene), were obtained by electrospinning. Acetazolamide and timolol maleate were loaded in the fibers in different concentrations (below and above the drug solubility limit in polymer) in order to determine the effect of drug solubility in polymer, drug state, drug loading and fiber composition on fiber morphology, drug distribution and release kinetics. The high loadings fibers (with drug in crystalline form) showed higher burst and faster release than low drug content fibers, indicating the release was more sustained when the drug was encapsulated inside the fibers, in amorphous form. Moreover, timolol maleate was released faster than acetazolamide, indicating that drug solubility in polymer influences the partition of drug between polymer and elution medium, while fiber composition also controlled drug release. At low loadings, total release was not achieved (cumulative release percentages smaller than 100%), suggesting that drug remained trapped in the fibers. The modeling of release data implied a three stage release mechanism: a dissolution stage, a desorption and subsequent diffusion through water-filled pores, followed by polymer degradation control.", 
    "180": "Glucocorticoids play a role in memory formation, and they may contribute to memory changes in stress-related mental disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Cortisol may act through mineralocorticoid (MR) or glucocorticoid (GR) receptors, and the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the MR antagonist spironolactone, the GR antagonist mifepristone, the MR agonist fludrocortisone, and the GR agonist dexamethasone on the extinction of contextually conditioned fear in rats. Propranolol was used as a positive control. As expected, propranolol administered before the test session increased memory extinction. Pre-test administration of spironolactone and low-dose dexamethasone also increased the extinction of an aversive memory, whereas fludrocortisone impaired extinction. High-dose dexamethasone and mifepristone were found to have no effect in this model. Post-test spironolactone treatment impaired aversive memory extinction. These results indicate that MR and GR are related to extinction of aversive memories, and MR blockade may be a promising candidate for the treatment of stress-related memory disorders.", 
    "181": "The impact of baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) on outcomes in patients with advanced chronic systolic heart failure (HF) has not been studied using a propensity-matched design. Of the 2,706 participants in the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST) with chronic HF, New York Heart Association class III to IV symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%, 1,751 had SBP < or =120 mm Hg (median 108, range 70 to 120) and 955 had SBP >120 mm Hg (median 134, range 121 to 192). Propensity scores for SBP >120 mm Hg, calculated for each patient, were used to assemble a matched cohort of 545 pairs of patients with SBPs < or =120 and >120 mm Hg who were balanced in 65 baseline characteristics. Matched Cox regression models were used to estimate associations between SBP < or =120 mm Hg and outcomes over 4 years of follow-up. Matched participants had a mean age +/- SD of 62 +/- 12 years, 24% were women, and 24% were African-American. HF hospitalization occurred in 38% and 32% of patients with SBPs < or =120 and >120 mm Hg, respectively (hazard ratio 1.33 SBP < or =120 was compared to >120 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.69, p = 0.023). All-cause mortality occurred in 28% and 30% of matched patients with SBPs < or =120 and >120 mm Hg, respectively (hazard ratio 1.13 SBP < or =120 compared to >120 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.49, p = 0.369). In conclusion, in patients with advanced chronic systolic HF, baseline SBP < or =120 mm Hg is associated with increased risk of HF hospitalization, but had no association with all-cause mortality."
