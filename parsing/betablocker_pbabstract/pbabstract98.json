    "4": "The present study was conducted to characterize possible rapid effects of 17-\u03b2-estradiol on voltage-gated K(+) channels in preoptic neurons and, in particular, to identify the mechanisms by which 17-\u03b2-estradiol affects the K(+) channels. Whole-cell currents from dissociated rat preoptic neurons were studied by perforated-patch recording. 17-\u03b2-Estradiol rapidly (within seconds) and reversibly reduced the K(+) currents, showing an EC(50) value of 9.7 \u00b5M. The effect was slightly voltage dependent, but independent of external Ca(2+), and not sensitive to an estrogen-receptor blocker. Although 17-\u03b1-estradiol also significantly reduced the K(+) currents, membrane-impermeant forms of estradiol did not reduce the K(+) currents and other estrogens, testosterone and cholesterol were considerably less effective. The reduction induced by estradiol was overlapping with that of the K(V)-2-channel blocker r-stromatoxin-1. The time course of K(+) current in 17-\u03b2-estradiol, with a time-dependent inhibition and a slight dependence on external K(+), suggested an open-channel block mechanism. The properties of block were predicted from a computational model where 17-\u03b2-estradiol binds to open K(+) channels. It was concluded that 17-\u03b2-estradiol rapidly reduces voltage-gated K(+) currents in a way consistent with an open-channel block mechanism. This suggests a new mechanism for steroid action on ion channels.", 
    "5": "Exercise hyperaemia in hypoxia is augmented relative to the same level of exercise in normoxia. At moderate exercise intensities, the mechanism(s) underlying this augmented response are currently unclear. We tested the hypothesis that endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) and vasodilating prostaglandins (PGs) contribute to the augmented muscle blood flow during hypoxic exercise relative to normoxia. In 10 young healthy adults, we measured forearm blood flow (FBF; Doppler ultrasound) and calculated the vascular conductance (FVC) responses during 5 min of rhythmic handgrip exercise at 20% maximal voluntary contraction in normoxia (NormEx) and isocapnic hypoxia (HypEx; O2 saturation \u223c85%) before and after local intra-brachial combined blockade of NO synthase (NOS; via N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine: L-NMMA) and cyclooxygenase (COX; via ketorolac). All trials were performed during local \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade to eliminate sympathoadrenal influences on vascular tone and thus isolate local vasodilatation. Arterial and deep venous blood gases were measured and oxygen consumption (VO2) was calculated. In control (saline) conditions, FBF after 5 min of exercise in hypoxia was greater than in normoxia (345 \u00b1 21 ml min(\u22121)\u2002vs. 297 \u00b1 18 ml min(\u22121); P < 0.05). After NO\u2013PG block, the compensatory increase in FBF during hypoxic exercise was blunted \u223c50% and thus was reduced compared with control hypoxic exercise (312 \u00b1 19 ml min(\u22121); P < 0.05), but this was not the case in normoxia (289 \u00b1 15 ml min(\u22121); P = 0.33). The lower FBF during hypoxic exercise was associated with a compensatory increase in O2 extraction, and thus VO2 was maintained at normal control levels (P = 0.64\u20130.99). We conclude that under the experimental conditions employed, NO and PGs have little role in normoxic exercise hyperaemia whereas combined NO\u2013PG inhibition reduces hypoxic exercise hyperaemia and abolishes hypoxic vasodilatation at rest. Additionally, VO2 of the tissue was maintained in hypoxic conditions at rest and during exercise, despite attenuated oxygen delivery following NO\u2013PG blockade, due to an increase in O2 extraction at the level of the muscle.",

Animal models have been used for decades to investigate the cause and cures of asthma, and while they do not always mimic many of the facets of this syndrome, mechanistic animal studies are still nevertheless very useful. Animal studies with beta-agonists suggest much broader and perhaps more important roles for beta-agonists since beta-agonists reduce aspects of inflammation and may affect structural remodeling. Studies using enantiomers of beta-agonists provide a confusing picture of the degree and mechanism of the deleterious effects of racemic mixtures and/or the S-enantiomer or other classes of beta-agonists.

    "34": "Hypertension is strongly associated with cardio/cerebrovascular diseases, e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, which are main causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In hypertensive subjects, cardiovascular risk reduction is mainly associated with reduction in brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP). As it was shown in controlled and long-term therapeutic trials, it is possible to produce a selective SBP reduction through a specific \"de-stiffening\" strategy. This means that SBP reduction is obtained independently of mean arterial pressure change, using a significant and selective reduction of wave reflections and/or aortic stiffness. The procedure is especially effective in decreasing central systolic and pulse pressures, which were shown to be major determinants of long-term outcome. As some concerns associated with decreasing in diastolic blood pressure to low values (so called \"J-curve\" phenomenon) have been raised recently the de-stiffening strategy appears to be especially attractive. Most of the protocols used to de-stiffen large arteries required the administration of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor, which frequently was associated with a diuretic and/or a calcium antagonist, but not with a classic beta-blocker. These protocols were evaluated in randomized controlled trials and showed significant reduction in cardiovascular risk, particularly in comparison with beta-blockers.",

Carvedilol at concentrations between 10 and 40 \u00b5M increased [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) in a concentration-dependent fashion. The Ca\u00b2\u207a signal was decreased by 50% by removing extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a. Carvedilol-induced Ca\u00b2\u207a entry was not affected by the store-operated Ca\u00b2\u207a channel blockers nifedipine, econazole, and SK&F96365, but was enhanced by activation or inhibition of protein kinase C. In Ca\u00b2\u207a-free medium, incubation with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a pump inhibitor thapsigargin did not change carvedilol-induced [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) rise; conversely, incubation with carvedilol did not reduce thapsigargin-induced Ca\u00b2\u207a release. Pretreatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) inhibited carvedilol-induced [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) release. Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 did not alter carvedilol-induced [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) rise. Carvedilol at 5-50 \u00b5M induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. The death was not reversed when cytosolic Ca\u00b2\u207a was chelated with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM). Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay suggests that apoptosis played a role in the death. Collectively, in OC2 cells, carvedilol induced [Ca\u00b2\u207a](i) rise by causing phospholipase C-independent Ca\u00b2\u207a release from mitochondria and non-endoplasmic reticulum stores, and Ca\u00b2\u207a influx via protein kinase C-regulated channels.

Therefore, we assessed the effects of \u03b22AR antagonist butoxamine on the protection of oxygen treatment against zymosan-induced generalized inflammation in mice. Mice were given oxygen treatment by exposure to 100% oxygen for 3 h starting at 4 and 12 h after zymosan injection, respectively. In the mortality study, survival was monitored for 7 days after zymosan injection in mice. At 24 h after zymosan injection, mice were killed, and blood sample and organs were harvested for analysis. We observed that 100% oxygen treatment prevented the abnormal changes in organ histopathology, lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein in serum, inflammatory cytokines in serum and tissue, and arterial blood gas analysis and improved the survival rate in zymosan-challenged mice. We found that pretreatment with \u03b22AR antagonist butoxamine partly abolished the protection of 100% oxygen inhalation. We also showed that zymosan induced the increase in serum 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and the decrease in tissue cAMP. However, oxygen treatment increased the cAMP levels in both serum and tissue, which were partly abolished by pretreatment with butoxamine. Thus, 100% oxygen inhalation may protect against zymosan-induced generalized inflammation in mice partly through activation of \u03b22AR pathway and subsequently enhance cAMP levels in both serum and tissue.",

The cohort included 368 men (64.1%) and 206 (35.8%) women (mean age 65.1 \u00b1 14.4 years) with a mean duration on dialysis of 72.1 \u00b1 60.4 months. Hypertension (75.6%) and coronary artery disease (47.2%) were the commonest cardiovascular risk factors for AF. The prevalence of AF was 23.2% and showed an age-dependent increase; in patients <50 years, AF was present in 9.3%, while in patients \u2265 80 years, its prevalence increased to 36.4%. Furthermore, 8.3% of patients had permanent, 1.8% persistent, 12.7% paroxysmal AF, while the prevalence of paroxysmal atrial flutter and sick sinus syndrome were 1.2 and 2%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that age, smoking, left atrial and aortic root diameter, \u03b2-blocker and \u03b1-calcidol use, HF, and the presence of valvular calcifications (VC) on cardiac echo were independently associated to the presence of AF. VC on cardiac echo had an almost sevenfold increased association with AF (odds ratio 6.72, 95% confidence interval 3.23-13.98, P < 0.0001). Only 25.5% of high-risk (CHADS2 score \u2265 2) patients were receiving anticoagulants. AF is a frequent arrhythmia in HD patients. Apart from well-known risk factors, VC merits special attention in this patient population. Less than one-third of high-risk AF patients receive anticoagulants, possibly reflecting the absence of definite guidelines for the management of AF in HD patients.",

    "51": "A 6-month-old male European shorthair cat was examined because of a 2/6 systolic left apical cardiac murmur. Echocardiography revealed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (pressure gradient of 85 mmHg) caused by systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the septal mitral valve leaflet. After 2 months of oral treatment with atenolol, the cardiac murmur had disappeared. Echocardiography showed only slight thickening of the interventricular septum and resolution of the pressure gradient. The cat was discharged and its owner was advised to continue atenolol lifelong. Echocardiographic findings of a combination of left ventricular concentric hypertrophy and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction can be caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) or mitral valve dysplasia in the absence of hypertension and fixed aortic stenosis. In the case of HOCM, left ventricular hypertrophy is the primary process. In the case of mitral valve dysplasia, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is the primary problem, which leads to dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and ultimately to left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, due to pressure overload. If the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is reduced with an oral beta-receptor blocker the secondary left ventricular hypertrophy may resolve. This would not happen in the case of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented case of severe dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and severe left ventricular hypertrophy in a cat successfully treated with oral atenolol.",

    "102": "Fibrosis is part of airway remodelling observed in bronchial asthma and COPD. Pro-fibrotic activity of lung fibroblasts may be suppressed by \u03b2-adrenoceptor activation. We aimed, first, to characterise the expression pattern of \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes in human lung fibroblasts and, second, to probe \u03b2-adrenoceptor signalling with an emphasis on anti-fibrotic actions. Using reverse transcription PCR, messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors was detected in MRC-5, HEL-299 and primary human lung fibroblasts, whereas transcripts for \u03b2(1)- and \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptors were not found. Real-time measurement of dynamic mass redistribution in MRC-5 cells revealed \u03b2-agonist-induced G(s)-signalling. Proliferation of MRC-5 cells (determined by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation) was significantly inhibited by \u03b2-agonists including the \u03b2(2)-selective agonist formoterol (-logIC(50), 10.2) and olodaterol (-logIC(50), 10.6). Formoterol's effect was insensitive to \u03b2(1)-antagonism (GCP 20712, 3\u00a0\u03bcM), but sensitive to \u03b2(2)-antagonism (ICI 118,551; apparent, pA (2), 9.6). Collagen synthesis in MRC-5 cells (determined by [(3)H]-proline incorporation) was inhibited by \u03b2-agonists including formoterol (-logIC(50), 10.0) and olodaterol (-logIC(50), 10.3) in a \u03b2(2)-blocker-sensitive manner. \u03b1-Smooth muscle actin, a marker of myo-fibroblast differentiation, was down-regulated at the mRNA and the protein level by about 50% following 24 and 48\u00a0h exposure to 1\u00a0nM formoterol, a maximally active concentration. In conclusion, human lung fibroblasts exclusively express \u03b2(2)-adrenoceptors and these mediate inhibition of various markers of pro-fibrotic cellular activity. Under clinical conditions, anti-fibrotic actions may accompany the therapeutic effect of long-term \u03b2(2)-agonist treatment of bronchial asthma and COPD.",

The heart rate difference was analyzed by the logistic linear regression model with variables that included gender, age, body height, body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and the dosage of propranolol. The following global LV functional parameters were calculated: the real-end diastolic volume (EDV), the real-end systolic volume (ESV) and the real-ejection fraction (EF).",

The primary endpoint was the initial claudication distance (ICD) during treadmill exercise after 24-week treatment in the per protocol population, using a noninferiority statistical approach. A total of 177 patients (mean age was 66.3 \u00b1 9.2 years, 76.7% men) were randomized to study treatment and 127 completed the study; the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed on 163 patients, the per protocol analysis on 127 patients. Both drugs lowered blood pressure significantly. After 24-week treatment, ICD increased in the Neb group in the ITT population by 28.3% (95% CI 15.6-41.0) vs. in the HCTZ group by 26.5% (14.4-38.5), and in the per protocol population in the Neb group by 26.4% (13.4-39.4) vs. in the HCTZ group by 32.1% (18.4-45.7). Thus, noninferiority of Neb could neither be confirmed nor rejected. An increase of absolute claudication distance (ACD, mean percentage increase after 24 weeks on Neb 15.8 \u00b1 33.2 vs. on HCTZ 20.2 \u00b1 46.6) was observed without statistical differences between groups.

    "113": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of aortic depressor nerve (ADN) transection, supranodosal vagi denervation (NG vagi cut) and adrenergic receptor blocker treatment on the cardiovascular responses evoked by systemic injection of bombesin. The cardiovascular effects were studied in spontaneously breathing rats that were (i) bilaterally, midcervically vagotomized (MC vagi cut) and subjected to section of the aortic depressor nerves, (ii) midcervically vagotomized and subsequently vagotomized at the supranodosal level or (iii) midcervically vagotomized before and after pharmacological blockade of \u03b1- or \u03b2-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine and propranolol, respectively. An intravenous bolus of bombesin (10 \u03bcg/kg) in midcervically vagotomized and ADN denervated animals increased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). An approximate 20% increase in blood pressure occurred immediately following bombesin injection and lasted for 2-3 min. Augmentation of the heart rate occurred 30-60 s after the bombesin challenge and persisted for more than 10 min. After section of the supranodosal vagi, bombesin failed to induce an increase in heart rate. Blockade of \u03b1-adrenergic receptors with an intravenous dose of phentolamine significantly reduced post-bombesin hypertension. These results indicate that bombesin-evoked increases in blood pressure do not require aortic depressor nerves and supranodosal vagi and are presumably mediated by the activation of peripheral \u03b1-adrenergic receptors. Bombesin-induced tachycardia was dependent on an intact supranodose pathway and was amplified by activation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "114": "Diastolic heart failure (DHF) is an important entity, the significance of which is increasingly recognized. This report examines the available evidence regarding the role, significance, and mechanisms of DHF. Epidemiologic studies have documented the rising burden of DHF, and experimental data are revealing the unique mechanisms distinguishing it from systolic heart failure. Despite controversies on the definition of DHF, or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, standardized clinical criteria with supplementary imaging and structural data have identified DHF as a distinct pathophysiological entity. The mechanisms underlying DHF include abnormal matrix dynamics, altered myocyte cytoskeleton, and impaired active relaxation. The commonly held belief that survival of patients with DHF is better than that of patients with systolic heart failure has been challenged by updated data. The heterogeneous etiologies or risk factors for the condition include aging, diabetes, hypertension, and ischemia, making a common diagnostic or treatment pathway difficult. Novel therapeutic targets that address the pathophysiology of this disease are under consideration, although there are no proven therapies for DHF to date. Exacerbating factors include volume and sodium indiscretion, arrhythmias, ischemia, and comorbidities. Strategies to ameliorate or to obviate these precipitating factors are most effective in preventing DHF and its exacerbations. Meanwhile, prevention of DHF through appropriate and aggressive risk factor identification and management must remain the cornerstone of clinical intervention.", 
    "115": "Chronic heart failure remains a common end product of cardiovascular diseases and, despite significant advances in therapy, continues to be accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. Attenuation of neurohumoral overactivation with blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and \u03b2-blockers has improved outcome and helped reverse or halt disease progression in many patients; however, despite this, morbidity and mortality have remained elevated, and only marginal advances have occurred over the last few years. How best to combine these various agents continue to be tested but, apart from the addition of aldosterone receptor blockers and reduction of heart rate with ivabradine, advances have been few. Implantable defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization devices have proved to be very beneficial, and the limits of their use are presently still being tested. How best to handle atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure remains unanswered, but for now, rate control appears to be appropriate in many patients. Surgical ventricular restoration of the left ventricle has not proved to generally be useful, and although the role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is well established in some patients, its use in others is being reevaluated. The use of biomarkers in patients with heart failure has stimulated great interest; however, much work remains before its full potential can be realized. As the complexity of the use of pharmacogenomics in clinical practice becomes clearer, research in the area is intensifying, but much work remains to be done before its use can be clearly outlined in patients with heart failure.",

The present paper reports, for the first time, the method for the simultaneous determination of \u03b2-blockers, isoflavones, flavonoids and metabolites in human urine samples. When flavonoids are ingested in combination with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range, interactions between flavonoids and drugs should be investigated. Substances of interest were extracted from urine samples by solid-phase extraction (SPE) employing a mixture of tert-butyl methyl ether:methanol:formic acid (4.5:4.5:1; v/v/v) as a mobile phase and Oasis HLB (Waters) as a stationary phase. Before extraction, urine samples were incubated with \u03b2-glucuronidase/sulfatase in order to achieve enzymatic hydrolysis. Before GC-MS analysis the analytes had to be derivatized with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) into their trimethylsilyl derivatives by incubating for 60 min at 60 \u00b0C. Statistical central composite design and response surface analysis were used to optimize the derivatization reagent. These multivariate procedures were efficient in determining the optimal separation condition, using peak areas as responses. The calibration curves were indicative of high linearity (r\u00b2 \u2265 0.9992) in the range of interest for each analyte. LODs (S/N=3) ranged between 0.6 and 9.7 ng/ml. Intra-day and inter-day precision (CV, %) was less than 4.96%, accuracy between 0.01 and 4.98% and recovery was found in the range from 70.20 to 99.55%. The developed method can be applied to the routine determination of examined compounds' concentrations in human urine. Moreover the method is suitable for detecting pharmaceutical compounds containing \u03b2-blockers, isoflavones and flavonoids in urine after administration to humans.",

The tolerability of beta-blockade in patients with mild and fixed airflow obstruction likely extends to those with more severe disease. However, the evidence is rudimentary. The long-term influence of beta-blockade on pulmonary function, symptoms, and quality of life is unclear. Low-dose initiation and gradual up-titration of cardioselective beta-blockers is currently recommended. Robust clinical trials are needed to provide the answers that may finally allay physicians' mistrust of beta-blockers in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Beta-agonists are associated with incident heart failure in patients with pulmonary disease and with increased mortality and hospitalization in those with existing heart failure.

However, the acute effects of mGluR activation on physiological response properties are unclear. To address this, we studied the effects of mGluRs in bushy cells (BCs) of the mammalian anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN). Activation of mGluRs with dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) caused depolarization of BCs in mice as old as P42, but did not affect neurotransmitter release by presynaptic auditory nerve (AN) fibers. Application of mGluR antagonists indicated that mGluRs are tonically active, and are highly sensitive to small elevations in ambient glutamate by the glutamate reuptake blocker threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA). mGluR-mediated depolarization enhanced the firing probability in response to AN stimulation, and reduced the latency and jitter.

The mean AUC(0-24) of celiprolol was lower in SLCO2B1*3/*3 individuals (775 ng\u00b7h/mL) than in *1/*3 (1097 ng\u00b7h/mL) and *1/*1 (1547 ng\u00b7h/mL) individuals following the TD, and this was confirmed in population pharmacokinetic analysis with statistical significances; however, SLCO2B1 genotype-dependent differences disappeared following the MD. Dose-normalized AUC of celiprolol at the MD was much lower than that at the TD, explained by the saturation of the efflux transporter. Thus, the effect of SLCO2B1 polymorphism on the AUC of celiprolol clearly observed only at the TD may be due to the saturation of the efflux transport systems.", 
    "154": "Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) consist of a pore-forming \u03b1-subunit and regulatory \u03b2-subunits. Several families of neuroactive peptides of Conus snails target VGSCs, including \u03bcO-conotoxins and \u03bc-conotoxins. Unlike \u03bc-conotoxins and the guanidinium alkaloid saxitoxin (STX), which are pore blockers, \u03bcO-conotoxins MrVIA and MrVIB inhibit VGSCs by modifying channel gating. \u03bcO-MrVIA/B can block Na(v)1.8 (a tetrodotoxin-resistant isoform of VGSCs) and have analgesic properties. The effect of Na(v)\u03b2-subunit coexpression on susceptibility to block by \u03bcO-MrVIA/B and STX has, until now, not been reported. Here, we show that \u03b21-, \u03b22-, \u03b23-, and \u03b24-subunits, when individually coexpressed with Na(v)1.8 in Xenopus laevis oocytes, increased the k(on) of the block produced by \u03bcO-MrVIB (by 3-, 32-, 2-, and 7-fold, respectively) and modestly decreased the apparent k(off). Strong depolarizing prepulses markedly accelerated MrVIB washout with rates dependent on \u03b2-subunit coexpression. Thus, coexpression of \u03b2-subunits with Na(v)1.8 can strongly influence the affinity of the conopeptide for the channel. This observation is of particular interest because \u03b2-subunit expression can be dynamic, e.g., \u03b22-expression is up-regulated after nerve injury (J Neurosci, 25:10970-10980, 2005); therefore, the effectiveness of a \u03bcO-conotoxin as a channel blocker could be enhanced by the conditions that may call for its use therapeutically. In contrast to MrVIB's action, the STX-induced block of Na(v)1.8 was only marginally, if at all, affected by coexpression of any of the \u03b2-subunits. Our results raise the possibility that \u03bcO-conotoxins and perhaps other gating modifiers may provide a means to functionally assess the \u03b2-subunit composition of VGSC complexes in neurons.",

However, basic drugs may undergo rapid dissolution from such solid dispersions in the stomach and precipitate in the intestine due to their higher solubility in acidic medium. Therefore, the objective of this work was to study the enhancement in bioavailability of carvedilol phosphate (basic drug) by providing an alkaline gastric environment to drug-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles.",

The predictive potential of the assay relies on an appropriate in-house validation of the method. The objective of the present study was to develop a single HPLC-UV method for the identification and quantitation of marker drugs and to determine the suitability of the Caco-2 cell permeability assay. A simple chromatographic method was developed for the simultaneous determination of both passively (propranolol, carbamazepine, acyclovir, and hydrochlorothiazide) and actively transported drugs (vinblastine and verapamil). Separation was achieved on a C18 column with step-gradient elution (acetonitrile and aqueous solution of ammonium acetate, pH 3.0) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and UV detection at 275 nm during the total run time of 35 min. The method was validated and found to be specific, linear, precise, and accurate. This chromatographic system can be readily used on a routine basis and its utilization can be extended to other permeability models. The results obtained in the Caco-2 bi-directional transport experiments confirmed the validity of the assay, given that high and low permeability profiles were identified, and P-glycoprotein functionality was established.",

Twenty-six hemangiomas occurring at locations for which corticosteroid treatment previously would not have been initiated (nose, lips, and parotid area) unless a complication had occurred were treated with propranolol and were rapidly controlled.

    "180": "We previously demonstrated that disrupting reconsolidation by pharmacological manipulations \"deleted\" the emotional expression of a fear memory in humans. If we are to target reconsolidation in patients with anxiety disorders, the disruption of reconsolidation should produce content-limited modifications. At the same time, the fear-erasing effects should not be restricted to the feared cue itself considering that fear generalization is a main characteristic of anxiety disorders. In Experiment I and Experiment I(b), we addressed these issues using a within-subject differential startle fear conditioning paradigm and a test of fear generalization. In Experiment II, we tested whether a behavioral approach targeting the reconsolidation through extinction learning was also effective in weakening the original fear memory. A behavioral procedure is evidently preferred over drug manipulations provided that similar effects can be obtained. Here, the extinction procedure subsequent to retrieval did not \"erase\" the emotional expression of the fear memory as the retrieval techniques (i.e., reminder shocks and reacquisition) unveiled a return of the startle fear response to the fear-relevant stimuli. In contrast, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade during reconsolidation selectively deleted the fear-arousing aspects of the memory (i.e., startle fear response) along with its category-related information. The pharmacological manipulation rendered the core memory trace too weak to observe fear generalization after successful reacquisition. Hence, relearning following the disruption of reconsolidation seems to be qualitatively different from initial learning. Our findings demonstrate that disrupting reconsolidation by pharmacological manipulations, although selective, undermines the generalization of fear, a key feature of anxiety disorders.", 
    "181": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PEF) is the clinical syndrome of heart failure associated with normal or near-normal systolic function. Because inhibition of the adrenergic and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems has been so effective in the treatment of systolic heart failure, these same therapies have been the subject of recent clinical trials of HF-PEF. In this review, we examine the current evidence about treatment of HF-PEF, with particular emphasis on reviewing the literature for large-scale randomized clinical studies. The lack of significant benefit with neurohormonal antagonism in HF-PEF suggests that this condition might not involve neurohormonal activation as a critical pathophysiologic mechanism. Perhaps heart failure as we traditionally think of it is the wrong paradigm to pursue as we try to understand this condition of volume overload known as HF-PEF.",

Separation of propranolol enantiomers was achieved on a Chiralcel OD-H chiral column using a mobile phase consisting of n-hexane-ethanol-ammonia (70:30:0.4, v/v/v), and the flow rate was 0.40 mL/min for 20 min. The analyte was monitored by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray positive ionization in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, using the transitions of m/z 260.2 --> 116.0. Propranolol enantiomers can be completely separated. The linear range was 2.5-1000 microg/L, and the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 2.5 microg/L. The values for within day and between day precisions and accuracies were well within the generally accepted criteria for analytical methods. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 2.64%, and the recoveries of the two enantiomers were 99.08%-102.58% and 100.21%-103.16%, respectively.

Similarly, MMP-9\u00a0is elevated following LC/HS, and \u03b2B prevents this elevation (390 \u00b1 100\u00a0pg/mL versus 275 \u00b1 80\u00a0pg/mL).",

In contrast, \u03b2B\u00a0protection of BM following LC is not mediated by G-CSF. Therefore, the mechanism of progenitor cell mobilization from the BM is dependent on the type of injury.", 
    "188": "The beta-adrenergic system has been suggested to be involved in novelty detection and memory modulation. The present study aimed to investigate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors on novelty-based spatial recognition memory and exploratory behavior in mice using Y-maze test and open-field respectively. Mice were injected with three doses of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (2, 10 and 20 mg/kg) or saline at three different time points (15 min prior to training, immediately after training and 15 min before test). The results showed that higher doses of propranolol (10 and 20 mg/kg) given before the training trial impaired spatial recognition memory while those injected at other two time points did not. A detailed analysis of exploratory behavior in open-field showed that lower dose (2 mg/kg) of propranolol reduced exploratory behavior of mice. Our findings indicate that higher dose of propranolol can impair acquisition of spatial information in the Y-maze without altering locomotion, suggesting that the beta-adrenergic system may be involved in modulating memory processes at the time of learning.",

Whether \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists potentiate gemcitabine, a standard first-line treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer that offers only modest benefit due to acquired chemoresistance, has not been elucidated. Thus, we studied the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects and the underlying mechanisms of gemcitabine combined with the \u03b22-adrenoceptor blocker ICI 118551 (1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-iden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol), in human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Results show that ICI 118551 significantly synergized the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects induced by gemcitabine in both BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells (P<0.05 combination vs. control or gemcitabine alone). When cells were treated with the combination of gemcitabine and ICI 118551, NF-\u03baB activation was blocked; the expression of Bax protein was substantially increased; and Bcl-2 protein was downregulated. Taken together, the data suggest that ICI 118551 potentiates the antiproliferative effects of gemcitabine by inducing apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Our study implies that this combination may be an effective therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer."
