We report a case of a patient receiving the selective beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist, metoprolol, immediately before surgery that was associated with severe hypoglycemia. We postulate that an underlying abnormality in energy requirements or metabolism may allow for beta(1)-selective-adrenergic antagonists to precipitate hypoglycemia.", 
    "1": "To reveal heterogeneity of mitochondrial function on the single-mitochondrion level we have studied the spatiotemporal dynamics of the mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling and the mitochondrial membrane potential using wide-field fluorescence imaging and digital image processing techniques. Here we demonstrate first-time discrete sites--intramitochondrial hotspots--of Ca2+ uptake after Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, and spreading of Ca2+ rise within the mitochondria. The phenomenon was characterized by comparison of observations in intact cells stimulated by ATP and in plasma membrane permeabilized or in ionophore-treated cells exposed to elevated buffer [Ca2+]. The findings indicate that Ca2+ diffuses laterally within the mitochondria, and that the diffusion is limited for shorter segments of the mitochondrial network. These observations were supported by mathematical simulation of buffered diffusion. The mitochondrial membrane potential was investigated using the potentiometric dye TMRM. Irradiation-induced fluctuations (flickering) of TMRM fluorescence showed synchronicity over large regions of the mitochondrial network, indicating that certain parts of this network form electrical syncytia. The spatial extension of these syncytia was decreased by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) or by propranolol (blockers of nonclassical mitochondrial permeabilities). Our data suggest that mitochondria form syncytia of electrical conductance whereas the passage of Ca2+ is restricted to the individual organelle.", 
    "2": "Consolidation is a process through which labile memories are made persistent [Science 287 (2000) 248]; [Annu Rev Psychol 55 (2004) 51]. When retrieved, a consolidated memory is rendered labile again and undergoes reconsolidation [Learn Mem 7 (2000) 73]; [Trends Neurosci 26 (2003) 65]). Reconsolidation thus offers the opportunity to manipulate memory after it is formed, and may therefore provide a means of treating intrusive memories associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Reconsolidation is most usually studied using protein synthesis inhibitors, which is not practical in humans. However, the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol impairs consolidation of declarative memory in humans [Science 287 (2000) 248]; [Nature 371 (1994) 702] and consolidation and reconsolidation of inhibitory avoidance learning in rats [Brain Res 368 (1986) 125]; [J Neurosci 19 (1999) 6623]. Here, we show that systemic or intra-amygdala infused propranolol blocks reconsolidation but not consolidation. If the effects on reconsolidation are verified in humans, the results would suggest the possibility that propranolol after memory retrieval might be an effective way of treatment of intrusive memories in PTSD. That the systemic effects of propranolol on reconsolidation are achieved via an action in the amygdala is especially important in light of the fact that PTSD involves alterations in the amygdala [Arch Gen Psychiatry 53 (1996) 380].", 
    "3": "We studied the effect of age on the response of aortic rings to injury produced by three days' incubation, and the mechanism of this response. Five-mm rings of the thoracic aorta isolated from Wistar rats were incubated or not in culture medium. Isometric contraction evoked by agonists (norepinephrine or serotonin) or high [K(+)](e) was determined in the presence and absence of endothelium. Experiments were repeated in the presence of propranolol (0.3 microM), polymixin B (36 microM), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (50 microM) or glutathione (3 mM). Inductible NO-synthase and cyclo-oxygenase-2 mRNA were determined by real-time PCR, and glutathione-related enzymes and catalase activity by spectrophotometry. Incubation reduced the isometric contraction evoked by agonists but not by high [K(+)](e). The reduction in agonist-evoked contraction was greater in rings from adult (norepinephrine Emax-80%) than in young (-40%) rats. The removal of the endothelium had no effect. The reduction in norepinephrine-evoked contraction was not due to endotoxin contamination, beta-adrenoceptor-mediated dilation or any change in ring structure (no fibrosis or edema). Inductible NO-synthase (but not cyclo-oxygenase-2) mRNA increased on incubation. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester partially restored contractility in rings from adult animals, further addition of an anti-oxidant restored norepinephrine-evoked contraction. Catalase fell with age and glutathione reductase increased upon incubation in rings from young donors only. In conclusion, incubation of the aorta produces a specific reduction in agonist-evoked contraction that involves induction of smooth muscle cell oxidative stress and iNOS. The reaction is greater in rings from older animals.", 
    "4": "The Toxic Oil Syndrome (TOS) was a toxic epidemic disease, related to the consumption of rapeseed oil denatured with aniline that affected more than 20,000 people in Spain and resulted in more than 330 deaths after its sudden appearance in 1981. It has been reported that the fatty acid esters of 3-(N-phenylamino)-1,2-propanediol (PAP) have shown a strong association with TOS. These PAP-esters could be absorbed and metabolized in a similar way than phospholipids. This is of interest because some products of phospholipid metabolism are important mediators in downstream pathways involved in the regulation of different nuclear factors. In particular, phospholipase D activity is involved in the activation of c-fos. Thus, we have investigated the effect of different PAP-esters in the induction of c-fos in lung fibroblasts. Results indicate that PAP-esters rapidly induced the expression of c-fos in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, both butanol and propranolol prevent this induction pointing to the involvement of phospholipase D in this activation. These results suggest that deregulation of some nuclear factors such as AP-1 could be involved in the pathogenesis of TOS.", 
    "5": "Sodium channels play an important role in many neurological disorders and also in prostate cancer. Tetrodotoxin (TTX), a blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels has been chiefly used as a molecular probe for the study and characterization of these channels. The regulation of gene expression in response for the exposure of TTX to glial cells which are reported to be involved in neurodegenerative process is poorly understood. Therefore, the present study aims to develop a repository of genes and map it on a few pivotal neurodegenerative pathways to speculate the effect of TTX. Using Affymetrix GeneChip (HG-U133A), we have selected a subset of 692 differentially expressed genes, several of which are-cullin 4A (CUL4A), ubiquitin carrier protein (E2-EPF), proteasome (prosome, macropain) subunit, beta type, 8 (large multifunctional protease 7) (PSMB8), protein tyrosine phosphatase type IVA (PTP4A1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and caspase 1 (CASP1). These genes, which facilitate some of the neurodegenerative pathways, such as ubiquitin, proteasome, inflammation and kinases, were identified to be up- or down-regulated for the TTX treatment. Thus, the selected genes were further examined on ubiquitin-proteasome mediated inflammatory responses pathway as ample evidence for the role of glial cell-mediated inflammation in the neurodegenerative process are available. In summary, our result provides a basic understanding of the differentially expressed genes along with one of the possible pathway which may have been modulated by the exposure of TTX.", 
    "6": "Feasibility to use probiotic bacteria as a living protein delivery system through oral route was assessed in vitro. Lactococcus lactis transformed with a plasmid to express and secret beta-lactamase was used to deliver beta-lactamase through Caco-2 monolayer, an intestine epithelium. Transport of beta-lactamase through Caco-2 monolayer was carried out in the transwells. The viability and integrity of the cell monolayers co-cultured with L. lactis was examined by trypan blue exclusion method and by measuring the transport of mannitol and propranolol as well as the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Results show that it is feasible to use cell culture technique to evaluate the drug delivery by normal flora. The transport rate of beta-lactamase when delivered by L. lactis was 2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-2)h(-1) (n = 9) and through free solution form was 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-2)h-1. When co-cultured with L. lactis, Caco-2 cell viability decreased to 98, 96, and 94% at 6, 8, and 10h, respectively. Transport of mannitol through Caco-2 cell monolayer was significantly increased and the transport of propranolol through Caco-2 cell monolayer was significantly decreased in the presence of L. lactis. Increase in the amount of protein delivered is probably due to the concentrate of the protein by L. lactis on the monolayer (absorption surface) and the opening of the tight junction of Caco-2 monolayer by L. lactis.", 
    "7": "Myocardial infarction is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Multiple therapeutic modalities have been shown to be effective in reducing adverse postmyocardial infarction outcomes. The most prominent drugs that have been used in this group of patients are those that oppose the effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These drugs include beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone blockers. Following initial success with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing mortality and cardiac remodeling in postmyocardial infarction patients, recent focus has been on adjunctive or alternative use of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists. Multiple large-scale, randomized trials have been conducted in order to compare angiotensin II-receptor antagonists with a combination of angiotensin II-receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone in postmyocardial infarction patients and also in heart failure. Although some results are conflicting, the weight of evidence is towards equivalency of these two groups of medicines, provided that the maximum effective dose of the angiotensin II-receptor antagonists is used. The combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and an angiotensin II-receptor antagonist may have additional benefits for some, but not all, patients; for example, reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure but not in postmyocardial infarction patients. Indeed, in the postmyocardial infarction setting, the combination appears simply to increase the side effects, without conferring additional benefits. Use of aldosterone antagonists as adjunctive therapy in postmyocardial infarction patients is associated with added benefits in terms of mortality reduction and will become the standard of care in this group of patients.",

    "9": "The prevalence of arrhythmia in the population is increasing as more people survive for longer with cardiovascular disease. It was once thought that antiarrhythmic therapy could save life, however, it is now evident that antiarrhythmic therapy should be administrated with the purpose of symptomatic relief. Since many patients experience a decrease in physical performance as well as a diminished quality of life during arrhythmia there is still a need for antiarrhythmic drug therapy. The development of new antiarrhythmic agents has changed the focus from class I to class III agents since it became evident that with class I drug therapy the prevalence of mortality is considerably higher. This review focuses on the benefits and risks of known and newer class III antiarrhythmic agents. The benefits discussed include the ability to maintain sinus rhythm in persistent atrial fibrillation patients, and reducing the need for implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock/antitachycardia therapy, since no class III antiarrhythmic agents have proven survival benefit. The risks discussed mainly focus on pro-arrhythmia as torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia.",

    "11": "Inorganic eluent additives affect the retention of protonated basic analytes in reversed-phase HPLC. This influence is attributed to the disruption of the analyte solvation-desolvation equilibria in the mobile phase, also known as \"chaotropic effect\". With an increase of counteranion concentration analyte retention increases with concomitant decrease in the tailing factor. Different inorganic counteranions at equimolar concentrations affect protonated basic analyte retention and peak symmetry to varying degrees. The effect of the concentrations of four different inorganic mobile phase additives (KPF6, NaClO4, NaBF4, NaH2PO4) on the analyte retention, peak symmetry, and efficiency on a C8-bonded silica column has been studied. The analytes used in this study included phenols, toluene, benzyl amines, beta-blockers and ophthalmic drugs. The following trend in increase of basic analyte retention factor and decrease of tailing factor was found: PF6- > ClO4- approximately BF4- > H2PO4-. With the increase of the counteranion concentration greater analyte loading could be achieved and consequently an increase in the apparent efficiency was observed until the maximum plate number for the column was achieved. At the highest concentration of counteranions, the peak efficiency for most of the basic compounds studied was similar to that of the neutral markers. In contrast, the neutral markers, such as phenols, showed no significant changes in retention, efficiency or loading capacity as counteranion concentration was increased.", 
    "12": "Arterial ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels are critical regulators of vascular tone, forming a focal point for signaling by many vasoactive transmitters that alter smooth muscle contractility and so blood flow. Clinically, these channels form the target of antianginal and antihypertensive drugs, and their genetic disruption leads to hypertension and sudden cardiac death through coronary vasospasm. However, whereas the biochemical basis of K(ATP) channel modulation is well-studied, little is known about the structural or spatial organization of the signaling pathways that converge on these channels. In this study, we use discontinuous sucrose density gradients and Western blot analysis to show that K(ATP) channels localize with an upstream signaling partner, adenylyl cyclase, to smooth muscle membrane fractions containing caveolin, a protein found exclusively in cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched membrane invaginations known as caveolae. Furthermore, we show that an antibody against the K(ATP) pore-forming subunit, Kir6.1 co-immunoprecipitates caveolin from arterial homogenates, suggesting that Kir6.1 and caveolin exist together in a complex. To assess whether the colocalization of K(ATP) channels and adenylyl cyclase to smooth muscle caveolae has functional significance, we disrupt caveolae with the cholesterol-depleting agent, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. This reduces the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A-sensitive component of whole-cell K(ATP) current, indicating that the integrity of caveolae is important for adenylyl cyclase-mediated channel modulation. These results suggest that to be susceptible to protein kinase A-dependent activation, arterial K(ATP) channels need to be localized in the same lipid compartment as adenylyl cyclase; the results also provide the first indication of the spatial organization of signaling pathways that regulate K(ATP) channel activity.", 
    "13": "Alterations in retinal amino acid neurochemistry are an indicator of metabolic function. Glutamate is the primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter within the retina, and excessive levels of glutamate can potentially cause excitotoxicity, in particular, through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Anomalies in NMDA receptor function have been implicated as causing many neurodegenerative disorders, and overactivation leads to neuronal death secondary to metabolic insult. Several pharmaceutical agents have been proposed as potential neuroprotective agents against excitotoxicity (e.g. betaxolol), yet any effects such drugs have on retinal neurochemistry have not been determined. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the changes in retinal amino acid neurochemistry secondary to the application of NMDA with and without betaxolol.",

Many of these substances are not biodegradable and their presence in influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants may cause adverse effects to sensitive biological processes such as nitrification, while on the other hand, they may go through the activated sludge process unreacted. The second step of nitrification, i.e. oxidation of nitrite to nitrate is particularly sensitive. Inhibition of this step under uncontrolled conditions may lead to accumulation of nitrite nitrogen in the plant effluent, a form of nitrogen which is particularly toxic. The effects caused by the presence of seven different pharmaceuticals to a culture of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from activated sludge are presented. These pharmaceuticals were ofloxacin, propranolol, clofibrate, triclosan, carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole. Different effects were observed for each of the pharmaceuticals tested in this study. In the cases of ofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole significant inhibition was observed. Triclosan presented a substantial inhibitory effect on the substrate (nitrite) reduction rate. The long-term effect of triclosan on nitrite oxidizers was also examined in a CSTR reactor and conclusions were drawn regarding the reversibility of the inhibition caused by this compound.",

In this work, the toxic-effect of six pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, propranolol hydrochloride, diclofenac sodium, ofloxacin and clofibric acid) on the anaerobic digestion process is assessed. Acetoclastic methanogenes are the most sensitive group of microorganisms participating in the anaerobic digestion process. Appropriate toxicity tests for these microorganisms were then based on assessing the impact of pharmaceuticals on the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of the anaerobic biomass. The toxicity was expressed by the IC80 and IC50 values, i.e. the concentration at which bioactivity was 80% and 50% of the control, respectively. Results showed that the pharmaceuticals tested caused a mild inhibition to the methanogenes in most cases, related directly to the tendency of the compounds to adsorb on the anaerobic biomass.", 
    "19": "The removal of commonly used pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, carbamazepine, atenolol, metoprolol and trimethoprim) and a biocide (triclosan) in operating wastewater treatment plants in five EU countries has been studied. Under normal operating conditions the acidic drugs and triclosan were partially removed with removal rates varying from ca. 20 to >95%. The highest removal rate was found for ibuprofen and triclosan (>90%) followed by naproxen (80%), gemfibrozil (55%) and diclofenac (39%). Ibuprofen undergoes an oxidative transformation to corresponding hydroxy- and carboxy-metabolites, which contributes to its high removal rate. Disturbances in the activated sludge process resulted in lower removal rates for all acidic drugs, mostly for diclofenac (<10% removed) but also for ibuprofen (<60% removed). The treatment of wastewaters by activated sludge usually did not result in any practical removal (<10%) of neutral carbamazepine or basic atenolol, metoprolol and trimethoprim. The removal rates of the investigated drugs and triclosan are discussed in terms of mechanisms responsible for their removal. Discharges of carbamazepine, diclofenac, gemfibrozil, naproxen, triclosan and trimethoprim from WWTPs to the aquatic environment, expressed as the average concentration in the effluent and the daily discharged quantity per person served by WWTPs were assessed.",

    "36": "Excitation of primary afferent neurons stimulates the expression of cytokines and nerve growth factor (NGF) in innervated tissues. Since NGF is a neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factor contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia and tissue response to injury, this study was conducted in order to investigate the mechanisms by which afferent neuron stimulation by topical application of capsaicin increases NGF in the rat skin. Thereby it was sought to identify possible targets for pharmacological modulation of NGF biosynthesis. Topical capsaicin (>1 mg/ml ethanol) caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the concentration of NGF in rat skin. The capsaicin-induced increase of NGF was not significantly affected by indomethacin administered at a dose (2 mg/kg) that abolishes prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis. The NGF increase was suppressed by treatment of rats with the selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist SR140333 (0.1 mg/kg), and by the beta adrenergic agonist terbutaline (0.3 mg/kg). The effect of terbutaline was reversed by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1 mg/kg). Terbutaline also inhibited the increase in NGF caused by intraplantar injection of the NK1 receptor agonist substance P (SP), but did not significantly affect that caused by carrageenan. The results show that topical administration of capsaicin causes a primarily NK1 receptor-dependent increase in the NGF content of rat skin, which is susceptible to inhibition by beta adrenergic agonists. These observations not only suggest regulation of skin NGF biosynthesis by afferent neuronal and adrenergic mechanisms, but also indicate possible targets for pharmacological modulation of skin NGF biosynthesis.", 
    "37": "Nebivolol is a racemic mixture of d- and l-enantiomers. The drug is characterized by beta(1)-adrenoceptor selectivity and long-acting beta-blockade exerted predominantly by d-enantiomer. Nebivolol is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and has no relevant membrane stabilizing action. Antiproliferative properties of nebivolol were demonstrated in endothelial and smooth muscle cell cultures. Infusion of nebivolol causes a vasodilation in all vascular beds by endothelial-dependent mechanism involving stimulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors as well as by endothelial-independent mechanism. Nebivolol possesses not only direct vasodilator properties but also augments the action of endothelium-dependent vasodilators. The antioxidant property of nebivolol can at least in part explain why treatment with this drug enhances eNOS activity and minimizes the reperfusion-induced myocardial injury. The systemic effects of nebivolol in humans have an unusual hemodynamic profile. In contrast to traditional beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, nebivolol reduces preload and afterload due to systemic vasodilation and improves arterial distensibility. At 5 mg daily nebivolol effectively reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure over a 24-h period. During treatment with nebivolol arterial pressure follows the natural circadian rhythm. Trough-to-peak ratio for nebivolol is 0.9. It has been demonstrated in numerous placebo-controlled studies that exercise tolerance is not reduced during nebivolol therapy. By chronic administration to patients with left ventricular dysfunction nebivolol increases myocardial contractility. Nebivolol produced no significant changes in lipid levels, insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance. These findings make nebivolol a promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of arterial hypertension and chronic heart failure.",

Mortality and morbidity were determined in 4576 low LVEF patients (2289 candesartan and 2287 placebo), titrated as tolerated to a target dose of 32 mg once daily, and observed for 2 to 4 years (median, 40 months). The primary outcome (time to first event by intention to treat) was cardiovascular death or CHF hospitalization for each trial, with all-cause mortality a secondary end point in the pooled analysis of the low LVEF trials.

The effects of SD size fraction, compaction force, and inclusion of plasticizers [namely diethylphtalate (DEP) and triethylcitrate (TEC)] on crushing strengths of matrices and release profile of drug were also investigated. The results showed that when compressed as a tablet, the SD system was more efficient in prolonging drug release than physical mixture. This effect was due to formation of much harder tablets of the SD system (crushing strength 8.5 kg) compared with those of physical mixtures (crushing strength 2.7 kg). All matrices of the SD system showed release rate patterns that were best described by the Higuchi equation. It was also shown that the rate of drug release decreased from 19.8% to 9.13% min(-1/2) as the SD size fraction decreased from 300-350 to 125-250 microm. However, further reduction of size fraction did not significantly affect tablet crushing strength and drug release rate. Increase in compaction force from 5 to 30 kN increased the crushing strength of matrices from 2.9 to 13.6 kg. However, the rate of drug release remained nearly unchanged beyond compaction pressure of 10 kN, indicating that crushing strength of matrices in the range of 8.5-13.6 kg did not affect drug release rate. The addition of 5% or 10% of either plasticizer (DEP or TEC) led to an increase in crushing strength of matrices and more retardation of drug release. This effect was more pronounced for higher concentrations of plasticizers. This effect was probably due to more plastic deformation of matrices under the compaction force, which helped matrices to retain their shape throughout the dissolution test.",

As it has been reported that isoproterenol can cause ischemic myocardial alterations, lipid peroxide generation and procoagulant activity, we administered it to rabbits in order to induce a non-invasive myocardial infarction associated with above mentioned cardiovascular risk factors. Considerable ischemic alterations were observed in the animals treated with isoproterenol, including areas of myocardial necrosis, contraction band necrosis, increased plasma levels of cardiac necrosis markers (c-troponin I and myoglobin), and electrocardiographic modifications (ST segment changes and T wave inversion). The myocardial infarction was attributed to the inotropic activity of isoproterenol leading to intracellular calcium overload. The cardiac necrosis phenomena appear to be associated with isoproterenol-induced lipid peroxide generation (as shown by the decrease in plasma Vitamin E levels) and increased procoagulant activity (a shortened PTT). As this model of myocardial damage is based on the use of beta-stimulatory isoproterenol, the beta-blockers propranolol and labetalol were administered to isoproterenol-treated animals. Pretreatment with propranolol or labetalol counteracted the appearance of the myocardial histological alterations and the associated ECG and biochemical lesions. This protective activity was attributed to the beta-blockade. The results of this study demonstrate that myocardial infarction can be induced chemically and non-invasively in small laboratory animals. The procedure is proposed for the study of early ischemic myocardial lesions and the screening of drugs (such as beta-blockers) that can prevent myocardial necrosis damage and the associated risk factors.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of chronic administration of ethanol on urinary excretion of short-chain organic acids and endogenous carnitines in rats. The data reported show that chronic administration of ethanol significantly increases urinary excretion of propionate, methylmalonate, as well as free acetate, butyrate, pyruvate, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Chronic administration of propranolol abolished ethanol-dependent accumulation of propionate, suggesting involvement of beta-adrenergic mechanisms. Increased formation of propionate and methylmalonate was associated with decreased plasma carnitine levels and with increased excretion of specific acyl-carnitines, corresponding to the accumulating acyl groups. Our data indicate that chronic alcohol ingestion induces increased excretion of selected organic acids and that the endogenous carnitine pool might exert a protective role against the deleterious effects of accumulating short-chain organic acids.",

The AT-1 receptor is a heptahelical Gaq/11-coupled receptor that initiates phospholipase C activity and release of intracellular calcium; recent data suggest that the AT-1 receptor can also activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), although the roles of specific EGF-mediated signaling cascades in AT-1 effects on mesangial cell biology are uncertain.

Currently it was examined by which principal mechanism tramadol induces oral dryness. The effects of intravenous administration (+/-)-tramadol were studied in rats on the flow of saliva in response to a peripheral cholinergic stimulus or to reflex activation involving the relay of impulses in the central nervous system. In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats, the salivary secretion to acetylcholine (0.1-10 micromol/kg IV) was increased by up to 110% by tramadol (1-5 mg/kg IV) and the protein concentration therein by up to 400%. The administration alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists resulted in almost identical acetylcholine-evoked responses as in the absence of tramadol. The secretory response to the application of citric acid on the tongue of the rat was reduced by 38% and by 64%, respectively, at 5 and 10 mg/kg IV of tramadol (p < 0.05-0.01). Thus, tramadol exerts its principal xerogenic effect by activating inhibitory pathways in the central nervous system and has no anticholinergic effect on the salivary glands at dosages that may be clinically relevant. Furthermore, the tramadol-induced increase of the acetylcholine-evoked secretion occurred at a glandular level and depended most likely on a release of noradrenaline from glandular nerve terminals.",

This study was to investigate the bradycardiac response of sinus node to ATP in patients with and without clinical SSS by measuring atrial cycle length (ACL) before and after bolus of ATP in different states of autonomic tone. The negative chronotropic effect of ATP was assessed by comparing the mean ACL before ATP administration with the longest ACL after a bolus of ATP infusion (Delta ACL). Our results showed that Delta ACL in patients with SSS were significantly greater than that without SSS (P<.001) in all 4 states, and IHR in patients with SSS were significantly lower than calculated IHR (P<.0001). Moreover, there was no significant difference in Delta ACL between the 4 states in patients with SSS (P = .99). However, Delta ACL was significantly greater during isoproterenol infusion and after propranolol administration in patients without sinus node dysfunction, comparing with baseline state (P<.01), but not after combination of atropine (P = .33). Our results indicate that the negative chronotropic effect of ATP on sinus node is much more dramatic in patients with SSS, in which the intrinsic disease of sinus node is responsible for the abnormal adenosine-mediated sinus arrest, and this effect is influenced by autonomic tone in patients without sinus node dysfunction but not in patients with SSS.",

Taken together, it is suggested that suppression of cerebral ischemic injury by 17 beta-estradiol may be ascribed to the maxi-K channel opening-coupled downregulation of PTEN phosphorylation and upregulation of Akt and CREB phosphorylation with resultant increase in Bcl-2 protein and decrease in Bax protein and cytochrome c release.",

    "99": "At baseline, nine patients had left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LV mass index > or = 51 g/m). After 4 weeks of therapy, the blood pressure was decreased from 148 +/- 8.1/101.4 +/- 4.6 mmHg to 140.7 +/- 7.0/91.1 +/- 7.4 mmHg and end-systolic stress was also significantly reduced. Heart rate was reduced (P <0.01), whereas LV end-diastolic diameter and stroke volume tended to increase (P=0.07 and P=0.09, respectively). No changes were detected in the LV mass index, relative wall thickness, fractional shortening and LV diastolic properties. Both resting and dipyridamole rate-pressure products were lower after nebivolol but dipyridamole-induced changes were not influenced by the therapy. In contrast, nebivolol therapy did not alter coronary velocities at rest, but caused a greater increase in coronary velocities after dipyridamole (P <0.03), leading to a greater CFR (2.12 +/- 0.33 versus 1.89 +/- 0.31, P <0.0001). Nebivolol induced an absolute increase of 8% in the CFR in nine of 14 patients (64.3%).",

Examinations were carried out on 110 cows with PM in three farms with similar system of rearing and nutrition. The control group consisted of 21 cows without postpartum disturbances. Smears from the uterus were taken before treatment and then at 21st day of observation. Escherichia coli and other species of Enterobacteriaceae family were isolated from 48.2% of PM cows and 47.6% of healthy cows. The degree of Arcanobacterium pyogenes infection was statistically lower in healthy than in sick cows (9.5% versus 30.0%). Streptococcus sp. was isolated from 13.6% of PM cows and from 16% of control ones. Staphylococci were isolated from 10% of PM and from 30% of control cows. Other bacteria species were isolated from about 10% of the examined cows. The best elimination of infections (66%) was noted in cows treated with the intrauterine antibiotic in combination with PGF2alpha i.m. injection. Examination showed that species of bacteria in the postparturient uterus were similar in healthy and sick cows. However, Arcanobacterium pyogenes was isolated 3 times more often from the sick animals. This pathogen was identified in 11 cows out of 19 (57.9%) culled subsequently because of infertility after the metritis puerperalis was clinically cured.",

There are a variety of medications that can be used during pregnancy either for treatment of significant chronic hypertension or in cases of acute severe hypertension. Most antihypertensive drugs have been shown to be safe for use in pregnancy. A variety of medications are available to treat more severe hypertension, although the use of pharmacologic therapy to treat mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy has not been supported in the literature. The data are more limited concerning drugs that would be used in the event of hypertensive emergencies or in an intensive care setting; however, in such a situation, maternal health and life become paramount and, despite lack of good studies, appropriate treatment should be rendered.",

That is why in patients with hypertension and incipient changes of the kidneys it seems most appropriate to use antihypertensive drugs with renoprotective properties. Early treatment with these drugs enables most effective lowering of risk of renal failure development and thus has a potential to prolong life of a patient. Selective microproteinuria is considered to be a marker of incipient renal impairement.

Efficacy of a selected drug was compared with magnitude of its hypotensive effect. The latter was calculated as difference between blood pressure (BP) before and 2 hours after drug administration. Lower quintile of distribution of BP differences (systolic BP difference >20 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP difference >15 mm Hg) was considered as excessive hypotensive effect of a study drug (EHESD) single dose. Exercise duration before ST-segment depression was significantly shorter (p<0.05) in cases with EHESD compared with those without EHESD. After 1 month of therapy total daily number of episodes of myocardial ischemia decreased by 3.2+/-3.0 and 1.8+/-1.2 in patients without and with EHESD, respectively (p<0.02). At the same time number of episodes of painless ischemia increased more than 2 times in patients with EHESD (p<0.01). Registration of EHESD at initial stages of treatment with short acting antianginal drugs appears to be a reliable marker of increased frequency of painless episodes of myocardial ischemia and low efficacy of regular use of these drugs.",

Patients with NYHA class II heart failure, ejection fraction 50% and moderately lowered tolerance to physical exercise (n=21) initially had enhanced cytokine expression: blood content of interleukin (IL) 2 was 2.8 times, tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) 78%, IL-1alpha 60% above normal level. Therapy with carvedilol in this group was associated with decreases of Il-2 (-23.8%), TNFalpha (-16.7%), IL-1alpha (-12.5%) (p<0.05-0.01). This was accompanied by alleviation of clinical symptoms and improved exercise tolerance. Patients with NYHA class III heart failure (n=16) with low left ventricular ejection fraction (30+/-2.7%) and low exercise tolerance had high levels of all studied cytokines. Levels of IL-2, TNFalpha and IL-1alpha were most elevated (3.1, 2.8 and 2 times higher than normal values, respectively). Therapy with carvedilol was associated with improvement of clinical symptoms and exercise tolerance (+35%, p<0.05)), increase of ejection fraction (+15%, p<0.05), decrease of left ventricular end systolic volume (-17.5%, p<0.05), and lowering of blood levels of TNFalpha (-31%), IL-2 (-17.4%), IL-1alpha (-15.6%).

BVR was quantified by Poincare plots at baseline and immediately before onset of d-sotalol-induced extrasystolic activity. TdP occurrence was associated with an increase in short-term variability (STV) of the left ventricular monophasic action potential duration (3.5+/-1.5 to 5.5+/-1.6 versus 3.0+/-0.7 to 8.6+/-3.8 ms, respectively), which was reversible when TdP was abolished by I(K,ATP) activation. The absence of TdP despite QT(c) prolongation after chronic amiodarone treatment could also be explained by an unchanged STV. In experiments with isolated ventricular myocytes, STV increased after I(Kr) block and was highest in cells that subsequently showed early afterdepolarizations.",

Cardiac mitochondria are implicated as primary targets for DOX toxicity, which is believed to be mediated by the generation of highly reactive free radical species of oxygen from complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The objective of this study was to determine if the protection demonstrated by carvedilol (CV), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist with strong antioxidant properties, against DOX-induced mitochondrial-mediated cardiomyopathy [Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 185 (2002) 218] is attributable to its antioxidant properties or its beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Our results confirm that DOX induces oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and histopathological lesions in the cardiac tissue, all of which are inhibited by carvedilol. In contrast, atenolol (AT), a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist lacking antioxidant properties, preserved phosphate energy charge but failed to protect against any of the indexes of DOX-induced oxidative mitochondrial toxicity. We therefore conclude that the cardioprotective effects of carvedilol against DOX-induced mitochondrial cardiotoxicity are due to its inherent antioxidant activity and not to its beta-adrenergic receptor antagonism.", 
    "117": "The current regimens of hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women, estrogen combined with progestogen, have failed to show beneficial effects for the prevention of atherosclerotic disease. Although the relatively higher dose of estrogen contained in those regimens exerted adverse effects, there are few data examining a lower dose of estrogen in an atherosclerosis model. Therefore, we investigated experimentally whether lower doses of estrogen could inhibit neointimal formation after balloon injury of the rat carotid artery. Ten-week-old Wistar rats were subjected to ovariectomy or sham-operation (n=7). Four days after ovariectomy, rats were implanted with an osmotic mini-pump containing 17-beta estradiol (0.2, 1, 2, 10 and 20 microg/kg/day; n=6, 4, 8, 6 and 5, respectively) or placebo (n=10). After 3 days of hormone therapy, balloon injury was performed in the left common carotid artery. Neointimal formation was histologically evaluated 2 weeks after injury. Cross-sectional intimal area and the ratio of intimal area to medial area were dose-dependently reduced by estrogen replacement compared with those in ovariectomized rats without estrogen replacement. The effects of estrogen replacement were identical to those of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, candesartan. Interestingly, the effect was significant even in rats receiving lower doses of estrogen, in which plasma estradiol concentrations were not increased and the hyperplastic response of the uterus was minimal. These results suggest the efficacy of low-dose estrogen therapy for the protection of atherosclerosis.",

    "119": "The mechanisms for the different proarrhythmic potential of antiarrhythmic drugs in the presence of comparable QT prolongation are not completely understood. The reasons for the lower proarrhythmic potential of amiodarone as compared with other class-III antiarrhythmic drugs such as sotalol, a fact that has been well established for years, is insufficiently known. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the different electrophysiologic effects of amiodarone and sotalol in a previously developed experimental model of proarrhythmia. In eight male rabbits, amiodarone (280-340 mg/d) was fed over a period of six weeks. Hearts were excised and retrogradely perfused. Up to eight simultaneous epi- and endocardial monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded. Results were compared with sotalol-treated (10-50-100 microM) hearts (n = 13). Amiodarone and sotalol (50 microM and 100 microM) led to a significant increase in QT interval (mean increase: amiodarone: 31 +/- 6 ms; sotalol: 41 +/- 4 ms and 61 +/- 9 ms) and MAP-duration (mean increase-MAP90: amiodarone: 20 +/- 5 ms; sotalol: 17 +/- 5 ms and 25 +/- 8 ms) (P < 0.01). In bradycardic (AV-blocked) hearts, MAP-recordings demonstrated reverse-use dependence and a significant increase in dispersion of repolarization (MAP90) in the presence of sotalol (P < 0.01), but not in amiodarone-treated hearts (10%; p = ns). Sotalol led to early afterdepolarizations (EAD) and torsade de pointes (TdP) after lowering of potassium concentration (6 of 13 hearts). In amiodarone-treated, hypokalemic hearts, no EAD or TdP occurred. Sotalol changed the MAP configuration to a triangular pattern (ratio-MAP90/50: 1.52 as compared with 1.36 at baseline) whereas amiodarone caused a rectangular pattern of MAP prolongation (ratio-MAP90/50: 1.36). In conclusion, these results show no direct correlation between the occurrence of TdP and the degree of QT prolongation. Several factors including reverse-use dependence, dispersion of repolarization, and the propensity to induce early afterdepolarizations but also differences in the action potential configuration may help to understand proarrhythmic side effects of drugs.", 
    "120": "The aim of this study was to evaluate \"in vivo\" the usefulness of molecular imprinting technology to obtain therapeutic soft contact lenses capable of prolonging the permanence of timolol in the precorneal area, compared to conventional contact lenses and eyedrops. Soft contact lenses (diameter 14 mm, center thickness 0.08 mm) consisted of N,N-diethylacrylamide (DEAA; main component of the matrix), methacrylic acid (MAA; functional monomer) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA; cross-linker) were prepared by the conventional methodology (non-imprinted) or by applying a molecular imprinting technique using timolol as the template (imprinted ones). After washing and reloading, timolol release studies carried out in rabbits showed that the soft contact lenses made by the molecular imprinting method (34 microg dose) provided measurable timolol concentrations in the tear fluid for 2.0- and 3.0-fold longer than the non-imprinted contact lenses (21 microg dose) and eyedrops (doses of 34 and 125 microg), respectively. Furthermore, the area under the timolol concentration-time curve (AUC) was 3.3- and 8.7-fold greater for imprinted contact lenses than non-imprinted contact lenses and eyedrops, respectively. The timolol concentration of the eyedrops did not affect the precorneal residence time of drug significantly. On the other hand, timolol loading capacity of the contact lenses was improved by the molecular imprinting method; the sustaining of the drug levels in the tear fluid being proportional to the loading capacity of the contact lenses. These results indicate that imprinted soft contact lenses are promising drug devices able to provide greater and more sustained drug concentrations in tear fluid with lower doses than conventional eyedrops.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the role played by catecholamines in the pathogenesis of the blood alcohol cycling observed when ethanol is fed at a constant rate. The rats were tested at the peaks and troughs of the urinary alcohol level (UAL) cycle and the results were compared with controls. Blood catecholamine levels were markedly increased at the peaks, but not at the troughs. Propranolol, a beta adrenergic blocker, attenuated the amplitude of the cycle. Phenoxybenzamine, an alpha blocker disrupted the cycle and elevated ethanol to fatal levels. The results indicate that both alpha and beta adrenergic mechanisms are required for the cycle to occur.", 
    "122": "The effects of the substitution of amino acid residues at positions 43 and 45 of rat CYP2D1 and CYP2D2 on their microsomal contents and enzymatic functions were examined. The substitution of Val-45 of CYP2D1 by glycine decreased the microsomal content, whereas the substitution of Gly-45 of CYP2D2 by valine increased. The substitution of Leu-43 of CYP2D2 by tryptophan also increased the microsomal protein content. In reduced CO-difference spectra, CYP2D2 showed a P420 peak as well as a P450 peak, whereas CYP2D1 gave only a P450 peak. The substitution of Leu-43 and Gly-45 of CYP2D2 by valine and tryptophan, respectively, markedly decreased the P420 peak in parallel with an increase in P450 content. These substitutions did not cause remarkable changes in drug oxidation capacities (bufuralol 1''-hydroxylation and debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation) of the recombinant enzymes in terms of nmol/min/nmol CYP. The results indicate that amino acid residues at positions 43 and 45 are important for anchoring of the rat CYP2D proteins and their stabilities in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.", 
    "123": "The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of various polymers, and fillers, and their concentrations on the release rate of atenolol from polymeric matrices. Four polymers namely hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), Eudragit RSPO, ethylcellulose (EC) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) were used. The dissolution profiles showed that an increase in the concentration of HPMC and EC resulted in a reduction in the release rate of atenolol. The results indicate that it is difficult to obtain a zero-order release from the matrices containing either HPMC or EC. It is also observed that the amount of HPMC played a dominant role, affecting the drug release in binary mixtures of Eudragit-HPMC. Generally, the presence of NaCMC caused an increase in the release rate of atenolol from HPMC matrices. To determine the effect of fillers on the release rate of atenolol from HPMC matrices, lactose (a soluble filler) and dicalcium phosphate (an insoluble filler) were used. The results showed that an increase in the concentration of fillers resulted in an increase in the release rate of the drug from matrices and hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of fillers had no significant effect on the release profile. In order to determine the mode of release, the data were analysed based on the equation Q = K (t - l)(m). Values of m were in the range of 0.32-0.99 indicating that release was controlled by both diffusion and erosion, depending on the type of polymer and concentration.", 
    "124": "We previously demonstrated that chronic stimulation of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) increases proliferation of cultured human cardiac fibroblasts (CF) via an autocrine mechanism. Here, we investigated the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in this process. ETA-receptor antagonism or protein kinase C inhibition abolished the beta2-AR-induced increase in cell proliferation. RT-PCR and ELISA analysis demonstrated that although CF synthesized and secreted ET-1, this occurred independently of beta2-AR stimulation. Furthermore, despite activation of the MAP kinase pathway, ET-1 treatment did not stimulate CF proliferation. Therefore, the role of ET-1 in this process is that of an essential co-factor acting independently of beta2-AR stimulation.", 
    "125": "Reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS) may contribute to the progression/enhancement of ischemic injury by augmentation of glutamate release, reduction of glutamate uptake, or a combination of both. Consistent with this, induction of nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) in murine neocortical cell cultures potentiated neuronal cell death caused by combined oxygen-glucose deprivation in association with a net increase in extracellular glutamate accumulation. However, uptake of glutamate via high affinity, sodium-dependent glutamate transporters was unimpaired by induction of NOS-2 under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Further, blocking possible routes of extra-synaptic glutamate release with NPPB [5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid], a volume-sensitive organic anion channel blocker, or TBOA (d,l-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate), an inhibitor of glutamate transport, exacerbated rather than ameliorated injury. Finally, treatment with riluzole or tetanus toxin attenuated the enhancement in both glutamate accumulation and oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced neuronal injury supporting the idea that increased synaptic release of glutamate underlies, at least in part, the potentiation of neuronal injury by RNOS after NOS-2 induction.",

Glyceryl trinitrate-induced dilatation was similar in the ACE group, the non-ACE group, and in the control subjects. In the ACE group, FMD was reduced after administration of aspirin (5.3 +/- 4.2%, p<0.05). The percent change in FMD after administration of aspirin correlated significantly with percent change in cGMP (r=0.77, p<0.03; y-intercept, -62.1%, p<0.01).

CYP2D6 genotyping covered alleles *1 to *6 , *9 , *10 , *35 , and *41 and the duplications. beta 1 -Adrenergic receptor polymorphisms Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly were included as factors possibly interfering with the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of metoprolol.",

    "156": "Aldosterone receptor antagonism (ARA) is an increasingly well-accepted element of heart failure therapy. The experimental underpinnings for the use of ARA in heart failure are strong being linked to a variety of tissue-based cardiac effects characteristic of drugs in this class. However, the benefits of ARA therapy do not come without some risk since drugs in this class are potent inhibitors of renal potassium (K+) elimination. Thus, some increment in serum K+, up to and including the development of overt hyperkalemia (typically defined as a serum K+ value in excess of 6.0 mEq/L), is to be expected whenever they are used. Hyperkalemia attributable to ARA relates to several factors including ARA dose, patient predisposition to hyperkalemia, as in the case of renal failure, and dietary intake of K+. The risk of some change in serum K+ with ARA should not be a deterrent to use of drugs in this class but, rather should prompt careful surveillance for the onset of this potentially life-threatening electrolyte disturbance. The frequency of such scrutiny should be patient-specific and based on the constellation of risk factors for hyperkalemia.", 
    "157": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease is steadily increasing in the United States. The magnitude of this problem is such that virtually all health care providers are being called upon to manage these patients. The interplay between chronic kidney disease and drug therapy is complex in that the kidney is both a target for drug effect as well as a moderator of drug elimination. Renal drug elimination occurs by filtration, secretion, and/or metabolism. For renally-cleared compounds, drug clearance typically falls in tandem with the loss of renal function. This process is noteworthy for drug accumulation when the glomerular filtration rate approaches the 30-cc/min range. The kidney is a target for drug effect in relationship to blood pressure and protein excretion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker therapy (usually given along with a diuretic) are the drug classes that have been shown to be effective for reduction in both blood pressure and protein excretion in the chronic kidney disease patient. A number of questions still remain unanswered in the pharmacotherapy of chronic kidney disease, including the optimal dose for these drugs as well as what represents the most favorable achieved blood pressure.", 
    "158": "The prevalence of heart failure is increasing in modern societies. Hypertension is a major contributor to the development of heart failure, whether through the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction or by promoting atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, which eventually leads to systolic dysfunction and left ventricular dysfunction. Effective therapy for hypertension can prevent more than 50% of heart failure events. Most studies done in the last three decades have used b blockers with diuretics as the modality of therapy. These agents have been shown to effectively prevent the development of heart failure. More recent comparative studies have shown that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are also effective in preventing heart failure. Calcium channel blockers, however, seem to be less effective in preventing development of heart failure in patients with hypertension. It needs to be emphasized that the most important variable in preventing heart failure is the appropriate treatment of hypertension.", 
    "159": "A hypertensive emergency, defined as an elevated blood pressure with evidence of acute target organ damage, can manifest in many forms, including neurological, cardiac, renal, and obstetric. After diagnosis, effective parenteral antihypertensive therapy (typically, nitroprusside starting at 0.5 microg/kg/min, but some physicians prefer fenoldopam or nicardipine) should be given in the hospital. In general, blood pressure should be reduced about 10% during the first hour and another 15% gradually over 2-3 more hours. The exception is aortic dissection, for which treatment includes a b blocker, and the target is systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg after 20 minutes. Oral antihypertensive therapy can usually be instituted after 6-12 hours of parenteral therapy. Consideration should be given to secondary causes of hypertension after transfer from the intensive care unit. Because of advances in antihypertensive therapy and management, \"malignant hypertension\" should be malignant no longer.",

Because not all patients undergoing major surgery were seen preoperatively by anesthesiologists, we also performed a retrospective analysis of patients who recently underwent such surgery. Data were collected on demographic information, cardiovascular risk factors, beta-blocker use, and perceived contraindications/barriers to beta-blocker use, using a validated instrument.", 
    "162": "The prospective phase studied 222 patients preoperatively, of whom 96 were suitable candidates for perioperative beta-blockade by the American College of Physician guidelines. The retrospective phase studied 200 patients, of whom 63 were suitable candidates, and assessed pre- and postoperative use of beta-blockade. 40.6% and 38.1% of suitable patients received preoperative beta-blockade in the two phases, respectively. Findings were similar in those undergoing vascular surgery, suggesting that perception of perioperative risk did not influence the decision to use beta-blockade. Beta-blockers were not prescribed preoperatively because of lack of knowledge about contraindications to beta-blockade, and anesthesiologist reluctance to prescribe oral medication to outpatients.", 
    "163": "Use of preoperative beta-blockade among suitable candidates appears to be approximately 40%. Anesthesiologists started preoperative beta-blockers infrequently even in patients without contraindications.

    "164": "Like Ras, farnesylation of the IP (prostacyclin receptor) is required for its efficient intracellular signalling, and hence the IP represents a potential target for inhibition by FTIs [FTase (farnesyl protein transferase) inhibitors]. Herein, the effect of SCH66336 on the isoprenylation and function of the human and mouse IPs overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and by the IP endogenously expressed in human erythroleukaemia cells, was investigated. SCH66336 yielded concentration-dependent decreases in IP-mediated cAMP generation (IC50 0.27-0.62 nM), [Ca2+]i mobilization (IC50 26.6-48.3 nM) and IP internalization, but had no effect on signalling by the non-isoprenylated beta2 adrenergic receptor or b isoform of the TP (prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor). Additionally, SCH66336 impaired IP-mediated crossdesensitization of TPa signalling (IC50 56.1 nM) and reduced farnesylation of the molecular chaperone protein HDJ-2 (IC50 3.1 nM). To establish whether farnesylation of the IP is inhibited and/or whether its 'CaaX motif' might undergo alternative geranylgeranylation in the presence of SCH66336, a series of chimaeric Ha (Harvey)-Ras fusions were generated by replacing its CaaX motif (-CVLS) with that of the IP (-CSLC) or, as controls, of Ki (Kirsten)-Ras 4B (-CVIM) or Rac 1 (-CVLL). Whereas SCH66336 had no effect on Ha-RasCVLL isoprenylation in vitro or in whole cells, it supported alternative geranylgeranylation of Ha-RasCVIM, but completely impaired isoprenylation of both Ha-RasCVLS and Ha-RasCSLC. These data confirm that the -CSLC motif of the IP is a direct target for inhibition by the FTI SCH66336, and in the presence of strong FTase inhibition, the IP does not undergo compensatory geranylgeranylation", 
    "165": "The effectiveness and safety of therapy with nebivolol and its effects on life quality (LQ) were studied in 71 patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) with an ejection fraction of 40% or more. The follow-up lasted 1 year. The mean daily dose of the drug was 3.66 +/- 0.11 mg. Echocardiography, bicycle ergometry, daily ECG monitoring, survey according to the questionnaires developed by V. P. Zaitsev, a researcher of All-Russian Cardiology Research Center, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, to the depression scale (DS), the personality scale (PS) and reactive anxiety scale (RAS) by Spilberg-Khanin were performed. The study was conducted on the day of initiation of outpatient treatment, following 3 months and 1 year. After 3 months of therapy, clinical improvement was observed in 83% of the patients and it preserved at the same level till the end of the first year: exercise tolerance and the total volume of work increased significantly (p < 0.001), 97% of the examinees returned to work. Nebivolol produced an antiarrhythmic effect in 66.7% of the patients with high Lown gradation premature beats. Therapy with the agent showed a low mortality rates (1.4%), few number of cardiovascular excesses (4.2%), and good tolerability (7.2%). By the end of the first year, cardiac remodeling improved insignificantly: end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume, left ventricular myocardial mass decreased by 6.4, 1.4, and 7%, respectively; fraction ejection increased by 2.3% of the baseline values. The parameters of LQ improved: the RAS scores reduced by 18.4%; the number of patients with high PS scores decreased significantly (p < 0.05) due to the increase in the number of patients with its moderate level (p < 0.01) and, what is significant, erectile function did not deteriorate. Thus, nebivolol demonstrated its high effectiveness and safety during prolonged therapy of patients with prior MI, without cardiodepressive activity and favorable impact on their LQ.", 
    "166": "A comparative randomized clinical study was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of the activation of proinflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8)] and the increased production of autoimmune complexes in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure (CHF) in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The study included 47 patients with CHD who had a more than 6-month history of Q-forming myocardial infarction. The patients were randomized into 3 groups: 1) 21 patients with NYHA Functional Class (FC) II heart failure (HF); 2) 16 patients with FC III HF; and 3) 10 with FC IV HF. Basic therapy involved angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nitrates, diuretics, beta-adrenoblockers; 27.6% received digoxin, disaggregatory agents. A study protocol involved the estimation of the parameters of EchCG, paired bicycle ergometric tests, 6-min walking test, ECG daily monitoring, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum and IgG autoantibodies to cardiolipin. The findings suggest that with the higher expression of autoimmune complexes, the activation of cytokines (primarily TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CHF in patients with postinfarct cardiac dysfunction: the high activation of cytokines and the elevated level of autoimmune complexes are associated with moderate or severe NYHA FC II-IV HF, depressed left ventricular contractility (ejection fraction, 23-38%), low exercise tolerance, and cardiac remodeling.", 
    "167": "Aldosterone blockade reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. We studied the effects of eplerenone, a novel aldosterone blocker, on the progression of left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in rats with dilated cardiomyopathy after autoimmune myocarditis. Twenty-eight days after immunization, the surviving Lewis rats were randomized to 1 month's oral treatment with low-dose eplerenone (group L), high-dose eplerenone (group H) or vehicle (group V). Five of 15 (33%) rats in group V and 3 of 15 (20%) rats in group L died during the course of treatment. High-dose eplerenone significantly reduced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, heart weight and heart weight to body weight ratio. Eplerenone improved left ventricular function in a dose-dependent manner. Central venous pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were lower, and +/-dP/dt and fractional shortening were higher in group H than group V. Eplerenone also attenuated myocardial fibrosis and reduced left ventricular mRNA expressions of TGF-beta(1) and collagen-III. Our results indicate that treatment with eplerenone improved left ventricular dysfunction and attenuated left ventricular remodeling in rats with heart failure.", 
    "168": "This study was performed to estimate the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of routinely administered metoprolol in middle-aged and elderly Japanese patients. Whole blood concentration data (65 samples) at steady-state following repetitive administration to 34 patients were analyzed using a nonlinear mixed effects model. A one-compartment model was parameterized in terms of oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F). We evaluated the effect of polymorphic alleles (CYP2D6*2, CYP2D6*10, CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3), age, gender, and heart failure on the pharmacokinetic parameters of metoprolol. The CL/F value in patients homozygous for the CYP2D6*10 allele was 64% lower than that in patients with a CYP2D6*1/*1 or *1/*2 genotype. The CL/F value in older (>70 years old) patients was 26% lower than that in younger (< or = 70 years old) patients. In addition, the V/F value in patients homozygous for the CYP2D6*10 allele was 25% lower than that in patients with the CYP2D6*1/*1 or *1/*2 genotype. On the other hand, the CYP2C19 genotype, gender, and heart failure showed no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The results suggest that the pharmacokinetic variability of metoprolol in Japanese extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 is very large, probably because CYP2D6*10 is responsible not only for the decreased systemic clearance (CL) but also for the increased bioavailability (F) of the drug.", 
    "169": "The purpose of this study was to develop propranolol extended release formulations containing hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC). The results indicate that the drug release from the tablet form containing a high amount of HPMC was incomplete, and avicel addition could increase the release percent at a later stage. In order to readily obtain an optimal formulation, response surface methodology and multiple response optimization utilizing a quadratic polynomial equation was used. The model formulations were prepared according to a factorial design. The effects of causal factors including the HPMC/drug ratio (X1) and avicel level (X2), on drug release were also measured. The drug release percentage at 1.5, 4, 8, 14 and 24 h were the target response and were restricted to not more than 25%, 35-50%, 55-70%, 75-90%, and 95-110%, respectively. The results showed that the optimized formulation provided a dissolution pattern equivalent to the predicted curve, which indicated that the optimal formulation could be obtained using response surface methodology. The mechanism of drug release from HMPC matrices tablets followed quasi-Fickian diffusion.", 
    "170": "We developed transgenic mice with targeted expression of human renin (hREN) and human angiotensinogen (hAGT) to either neurons (N-AII mice) or glia (G-AII mice) to test the hypothesis that neuronal and glial ANG II may have differential function. Since baseline blood pressure (BP) did not differ between the models (109 +/- 3 vs. 114 +/- 4 mmHg), we stressed the BP regulatory pathway by measuring the heart rate (HR) (baroreflex) response to phenylephrine- and nitroprusside-induced changes in arterial BP. The midpoint of the baroreflex curve (BP50) was reset to a significantly higher BP in N-AII mice (131 +/- 5 mmHg) compared with littermate controls (115 +/- 3 mmHg). Baroreflex gain (slope of BP-HR relation) was similar in N-AII and control mice (12 +/- 1 vs. 14 +/- 2 beats x min(-1) x mmHg(-1)). In contrast, G-AII mice exhibited less of an increase in BP50 (125 +/- 5 mmHg) but a larger decrease in baroreflex gain (8 +/- 1 beats x min(-1) x mmHg(-1)) compared with both control and N-AII mice. Differences in BP50 and gain between N-AII, G-AII, and control mice persisted after parasympathetic blockade with atropine but were eliminated after sympathetic blockade with propranolol, indicating the effects of ANG II were selective for cardiosympathetic arm of the reflex. ANG II-like immunoreactivity was observed more prominently around the paraventricular nucleus and nucleus tractus solitarii in G-AII mice but more prominently in the ventrolateral medulla in N-AII mice. We conclude that ANG II differentially modulates baroreflex control of HR in mice producing ANG II in neurons vs. glia, and its differential function may reflect regional differences in the production of ANG II in cardiovascular control nuclei of the brain.", 
    "171": "Regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization has been associated with the functions of polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), the protein products of the PKD1 and PKD2 genes. We have now demonstrated that PC1 can activate the calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) signaling pathway through Galpha(q) -mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Transient transfection of HEK293T cells with an NFAT promoter-luciferase reporter demonstrated that membrane-targeted PC1 constructs containing the membrane proximal region of the C-terminal tail, which includes the heterotrimeric G protein binding and activation domain, can stimulate NFAT luciferase activity. Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta by LiCl treatment further increased PC1-mediated NFAT activity. PC1-mediated activation of NFAT was completely inhibited by the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A. Cotransfection of a construct expressing the Galpha(q) subunit augmented PC1-mediated NFAT activity, whereas the inhibitors of PLC (U73122) and the inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors (xestospongin and 2-aminophenylborate) and a nonspecific Ca(2+) channel blocker (gadolinium) diminished PC1-mediated NFAT activity. PC2 was not able to activate NFAT. An NFAT-green fluorescent protein nuclear localization assay demonstrated that PC1 constructs containing the C-tail only or the entire 11-transmembrane spanning region plus C-tail induced NFAT-green fluorescent protein nuclear translocation. NFAT expression was demonstrated in the M-1 mouse cortical collecting duct cell line and in embryonic and adult mouse kidneys by reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunolocalization. These data suggest a model in which PC1 signaling leads to a sustained elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) mediated by PC1 activation of Galpha(q) followed by PLC activation, release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores, and activation of store-operated Ca(2+) entry, thus activating calcineurin and NFAT.", 
    "172": "beta-Adrenoceptors are important modulators of cardiac function. The present study investigated beta(3)-adrenergic eNOS activation in human myocardium. We measured nitric oxide (NO) liberation (diaminofluorescence) and signal transduction (immunohistochemistry, phosphorylation of eNOS(Ser1177), eNOS(Thr495), eNOS(Ser114), Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), and eNOS translocation) in human right atrial (RA, aortocoronary-bypass OP) and left ventricular nonfailing (LV, rejected donor hearts) myocardium after application of BRL 37344 (BRL), a preferential beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist. In both RA and LV, BRL (10 microl) induced a liberation of NO. An eNOS activation via translocation was only observed in RA after application of BRL (10 microM). Yet, the NO liberation in both LV and RA was accompanied by phosphorylation of eNOS(Ser1177) and Akt/PKB. BRL-induced eNOS phosphorylation was abolished by LY292004, a blocker of PI-3 kinase. eNOS-Ser(114) phosphorylation was unchanged in RA, but decreased in LV after beta(3)-adrenergic stimulation. BRL did not alter phosphorylation of eNOS(Thr495). In conclusion, receptor-dependent eNOS activation is differentially regulated in the human heart. In the left ventricle, eNOS activation via phosphorylation seems to be of major importance, whereas in human atrial myocardium eNOS translocation is the predominant mechanism induced by beta(3)-adrenergic activation."
