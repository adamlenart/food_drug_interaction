    "0": "The presence of extra-hepatic systems for uric acid production and their role in catecholamine-induced hyperuricemia were studied in eviscerated rats with functional hepatectomy. In these animals, the plasma uric acid level progressively increased with a decrease of allantoin, and isoproterenol subcutaneously administered in low doses produced an evident hyperuricemia. The effect of isoproterenol was seen even in nephrectomized animals, but all effects were abolished by pretreatment with allopurinol. Epinephrine and norepinephrine also produced hyperuricemia, though to a lesser extent than isoproterenol. Propranolol inhibited the hyperuricemic effects of isoproterenol and epinephrine, while phentolamine potentiated the effects of epinephrine. Electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve also produced hyperuricemia in eviscerated rats with functional hepatectomy, and this state was abolished by pretreatment with propranolol and by adrenalectomy but was not affected by pretreatment with phentolamine. Thus, beta adrenoceptor agonists stimulate production of uric acid in tissues other than the liver and the viscera, and hyperuricemia results. An effect similar to that on the uric acid level was also observed for the levels of plasma lactate, creatinine and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase in rats given isoproterenol.", 
    "1": "1. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine caused contraction of the corpus cavernosum muscle of the human penis. These sympathomimetic amines did not product inhibitory effects even in the presence of the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker, phentolamine. The effect of dopamine was similar to that produced by these three sympathomimetic amines. Higher doses of isoprenaline and salbutamol also contracted this preparation. 2. Cocaine and guanethidine enhanced the motor response to adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine while the action of dopamine was blocked by these two drugs. 3. The motor response to adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine was antagonized by phentolamine and often potentiated by the beta-adrenoreceptors blocking drug, propranolol. The contractions produced by high doses of salbutamol and isoprenaline were also abolished by phentolamine. These findings indicate that the motor response to sympathomimetic amines is the result of activation of alpha-adrenoreceptors in the corpus cavernosum muscle. 4. At low doses, isoprenaline and salbutamol relaxed the corpus cavernosum muscle strip. The inhibitory action was blocked by low concentrations of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist, propranolol but not by practolol (beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist) and butoxamine (beta 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist). beta-adrenoreceptors are present in the corpus cavernosum muscle but these are unlikely to be either of the beta 1 or beta 2 type. The possible existence of a third type of beta-adrenoreceptor is suggested.", 
    "2": "Subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) was measured in six male subjects by the 133Xe-washout technique during 3-4 h of exercise at a work load corresponding to an oxygen uptake of about 1.71/min. The measurements were done during control conditions, during blockade of lipolysis by nicotinic acid, during acute i.v. beta-adrenergic blockade by propranolol, and during continuous i.v. infusion of glucose. The most pronounced lipid mobilization and utilization during work was seen in the control experiments where ATBF rose 3-fold on average from the initial rest period to the third hour of work. No increase in lipolysis and no increase in ATBF were found when lipolysis was blocked by nicotinic acid (0.3 g/h). Propranolol treatment (0.15 mg/kg) reduced lipolysis and nearly abolished the increase in ATBF during exercise. Intravenous administration of glucose (about 0.25 g/min) did not influence lipid metabolism (evaluated by the respiratory quotient) nor did it reduce the ATBF response to exercise. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that increase in ATBF during exercise is elicited via direct stimulation of vascular beta1-receptors, while they are not in disagreement with the hypothesis that adipose tissue vasodilation during exercise is secondary to metabolic events connected to lipolysis.", 
    "3": "In order to observe the effect of the adrenergic system on pancreatic glucagon secretion in the isolated perfused rat pancreas, phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, and isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, were added to the perfused solution. 1.2 microM phenylephrine suppressed glucagon secretion at 2.8 mM glucose, and it also decreased insulin secretion at 11.1 mM glucose. 240 nM isoproterenol enhanced glucagon secretion not only at 2.8 mM glucose, but also at 11.1 mM glucose, as well as insulin secretion at 11.1 mM. In order to study the role of intra-islet noradrenalin, phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, and propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, were infused with the perfused solution. 10 and 100 microM phentolamine caused an increase in insulin secretion, and 25 microM propranolol decreased insulin secretion, while they did not cause any change in glucagon secretion. From these results, it can be concluded that alpha-stimulation suppresses not only insulin but also glucagon secretion, while beta-stimulation stimulates glucagon secretion, as well as insulin secretion. Intra-islet catecholamine may have some effect on the B cell, whereas it seems to have no influence on the A cell.", 
    "4": "The endocrine response to partial thyroidectomy in a group of twenty hyperthyroid patients prepared with propranolol alone was compared to that of a matched control group of ten euthyroid patients. In propranolol-prepared patients the glucose response to surgery was reduced (P less than 0.05) for up to 4 h post-operatively and biochemical hypoglycaemia was noted in one patient. Both thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3) fell significantly, associated with a marked rise in reverse T3. Growth hormone levels were higher (P less than 0.05) both pre- and post-operatively in propranolol-prepared patients, whereas prolactin levels, although similar pre-operatively, were lower (P less than 0.05) in these patients post-operatively. Cortisol and ACTH levels were lower (P less than 0.05) both before and following thyroidectomy in propranolol-prepared patients. These results suggest that the endocrine response to surgical stress is markedly altered in propranolol-prepared hyperthyroid patients.", 
    "5": "This study was designed to determine whether renal alpha-adrenoceptors can mediate tonic neural stimulation of renin secretion. The effect of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by phenoxybenzamine (POB) or prazosin on renin secretion rate (RSR) was studied in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs in which renal perfusion pressure was held constant with an adjustable aortic clamp. POB alone (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 iv) did not change arterial plasma renin activity (PRA). However, when beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by intravenous propranolol, intravenous POB infusion (100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) decreased PRA and RSR to 48 +/- 8 and 21 +/- 9% of previous levels within 30 min. This effect was abolished by acute bilateral renal denervation. Direct intrarenal POB infusion (10 or 3.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) decreased RSR, whereas intravenous POB (3.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) had no effect on either RSR or PRA in propranolol-pretreated dogs. Prazosin (1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 iv) also significantly decreased PRA. These data indicate that when beta-adrenoceptors are blocked by propranolol, tonic neural stimulation of renin secretion is mediated by renal alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "High levels of beta receptor agonist have previously been shown to down-regulate beta receptor density on circulating leukocytes in man; however, the factors controlling receptor density under physiological conditions have not previously been defined. To determine whether beta receptor density is normally down-regulated by circulating, physiological levels of catecholamines we have examined the relationship between receptor density and catecholamine levels. Urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine were significantly reciprocally correlated to lymphocyte receptor density. A similar relationship existed between beta receptor density and supine plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, upright epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels. Change in sodium intake from 10 to 400 meq/d caused a 52% increase in lymphocyte and a 48% increase in polymorphonuclear beta receptor density. The changes in receptor density were accompanied by an increase in the sensitivity to isoproterenol measured as a fall in the dose of isoproterenol required to raise the heart rate by 25 beats per minute. Beta receptor density on both lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cells was significantly correlated to the cardiac sensitivity to isoproterenol. Propranolol administration resulted in an increase in the density of beta receptors on lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cells that correlated with the subject's pretreatment catecholamine levels. These findings, therefore, suggest that physiological levels of catecholamines normally down-regulate beta receptors in man and that blockade of this down-regulation by propranolol allows receptor density to increase.", 
    "7": "1 Calcium current (ICa) and potassium current (IK) in isolated nerve cell bodies of Helix aspersa were independently separated after suppression of Na+ and K+ currents, and Na+ and Ca2+ currents, respectively. The suction pipette method was used. Under voltage clamp conditions, the effects of propranolol on both the ICa and IK were examined. 2 Propranolol inhibits the ICa at relatively low concentrations (10(-6)-10(-5) M). The inhibitory action was dose-dependent. 3 The IK was moderately suppressed by the drug at high concentrations (10(-5)-5 X 10(-1) M). 4 Results provide evidence for a new aspect of the pharmacological action of propranolol on the excitable cell membrane.", 
    "8": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril was assessed during short- and long-term periods in ten patients with elevated blood pressure readings that were uncontrollable by standard therapy (supine diastolic blood pressure of greater than 100 mm Hg with a regimen of propranolol hydrochloride, hydralazine hydrochloride, and hydrochlorothiazide). When given alone, captopril therapy was unable to normalize the blood pressure in any patient. The addition of hydrochlorothiazide to the captopril therapy normalized the blood pressure in one patient and sharply improved the blood pressure in four others. The blood pressure in the remaining patients responded inadequately to this combination. The addition of propranolol to captopril and hydrochlorothiazide reduced the blood pressure further in most cases (seven on the ten patients had normal blood pressure readings while they received these three drugs). In four patients, the blood pressure response to the added propranolol was unrelated to changes in plasma angiotensin II concentration. Captopril was helpful in the management of refractory hypertension in most cases.", 
    "9": "Halothane depresses the inotropic state of the heart, possibly by decreasing the rate of formation of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) through depression of the activity of adenylate cyclase, the cAMP-generating enzyme. As catecholamines regulate the inotropic state and adenylate cyclase activity by binding to myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors, the effect of halothane on binding to these receptors was studied to determine whether this was a site of halothane effect. Beta-adrenergic binding was measured at binding equilibrium in vitro in a canine myocardial membrane preparation in the absence and presence of halothane, 3 to 5 vol%, using as the radioligand 3H-dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA), a beta-adrenergic antagonist with high affinity and radioactivity. In addition, the effect of halothane on the binding of l-isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, was measured by displacement of 3H-DHA. The results indicate that halothane has no effect on either the affinity of canine myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors for 3H-DHA or l-isoproterenol, nor does it alter the number of available receptors at binding equilibrium.", 
    "10": "We describe a method for the simultaneous high performance liquid chromatographic determination of several antiarrhythmic drugs and some of their metabolites after extraction from 2.5 mL of spiked pooled sera. The extracts were applied to a C8 reversed phase column. Nine compounds of interest were resolved within the 30 minute run. An initial mobile phase of 80% phosphate (25 mmol/L, pH 3.5), 20% organic (acteonitrile:methanol, 2:3) was maintained for 2 min at which time a linear gradient was used to change the mobile phase to 30% phosphate, 70% organic at 20 min after injection. This composition was maintained from an additional 5 min. Absorbance at 212 nm was used for detection. Peak area ratios of drug to internal standard (N-propionylprocainamide) were used for quantitation. The relative standard deviations (and mean solute concentrations) of daily duplicate determinations for 15 days are: procainamide, 5.1% (5.9 mg/L); N-acetylprocainamide, 9.3% (6.0 mg/L); Mono-N-dealkyldisopyramide, 3.7% (4.1 mg/L); disopyramide, 4.3% (4.0 mg/L); quinidine, 4.5% (6.5 mg/L); and propranolol, 5.1% (0.097 mg/L). Dihydroquinidine and 4-hydroxypropranolol were also resolved but not quantitated.", 
    "11": "Several factors that may affect protein binding of lidocaine in human serum were studied in normal volunteers. Evidence was obtained for the presence of two classes of lidocaine binding sites with strikingly different affinity constants (k) and capacities (nP); k1 equals 1.3 x 10(5)M(-1), n1P1 equals 1.7 x 10(-5)M, and k2 equals 6.4 x 10(1)M(-1), n2P2 equals 6.9 x 10(-3)M. The low affinity binding sites are probably on serum albumin, whereas the high affinity site may be located on alpha 1 acid glycoprotein. At a lidocaine serum concentration of approximately 1.4 microgram/ml, it was observed that acidosis (pH 7.4 leads to 7.2) caused lidocaine-free fraction to increase from 0.29 to 0.36 (p less than 0.01) and that the addition of the lidocaine metabolites 3-hydroxylidocaine, 4-hydroxylidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide, and glycinexylidide had no effect on the binding of lidocaine. Bupivacaine, disopyramide, and quinidine (in concentrations that are observed clinically) caused a significant increase (p less than 0.01) in the free fraction of lidocaine in serum (23%, 21%, and 34%, respectively. Interestingly, N-depropyl disopyramide, dihydroquinidine, procainamide, N-acetyl procainamide, and propranolol had no effect on lidocaine binding.", 
    "12": "1. The possibility of using contractility studies with the rat right ventricle strip to assess the effects of drugs on all aspects of noradrenergic transmission has been examined. 2. The force of the contractile responses to field stimulation at 0.5 and 2, but not 5 Hz, markedly decreased with time. About 55% of the tissues responded directly to (-)-isoprenaline, 1 X 10(-6)M (123 tissues from 220 tested) in the absence of other stimuli. In these tissues the force of the contractile responses remained constant and the rate increased with time. Thus it is essential to provide time controls in studies with rat right ventricle. 3. Under conditions in which the responses to (-)-isoprenaline, 1 X 10(-6)M, alone were unaffected the responses to field stimulation at 5 Hz were inhibited by 66 and 86% by 9 X 10(-6)M tetrodotoxin and 1 X 10(-5)M guanethidine, respectively. (+/-)-Propranolol and timolol (both at 1 X 10(-6)M), but not phentolamine, 1 X 10(-6)M, inhibited responses to (-)-isoprenaline, 1 X 10(-6)M alone and responses to field stimulation at 5 Hz. This demonstrates that the responses to field stimulation are largely due to activation of noradrenergic nerves, the released noradrenaline acting at postsynaptic beta-adrenoreceptors. 4. Although nortriptyline is a potent inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of noradrenaline, at 1 X 10(-6)M it had no effect on the contractile responses to field stimulation at 5 Hz and inhibited responses to (-)-isoprenaline, 1 X 10(-6)M, alone and at a higher concentration (1 X 10(-5)M) nortriptyline abolished both responses. It is suggested that the rat ventricle preparation may be useful in examining the effects of drugs on noradrenergic transmission in the heart.", 
    "13": "Five patients with acute myocardial infarction and shock were treated with a new, highly selective beta-1-adrenoreceptor agonist, prenalterol. After 1 and 2 mg of the drug, all patients had markedly increased blood pressure and cardiac output, but no changes in heart rate or systemic vascular resistance. Left- and right-sided filling pressures decreased in three of the patients. In two of the patients, however, the increase in contractility and afterload was followed by a marked increase in left- and right-sided filling pressures, and myocardial lactate uptake changes to lactate production. After addition of sodium nitroprusside, blood pressure and filling pressures returned towards normal, and myocardial lactate uptake was restored. As anticipated from the hemodyanamic findings, myocardial oxygen consumption increased after prenalterol. It is suggested that the potent inotropic agent prenalterol may be used with great caution in cardiogenic shock.", 
    "14": "For the past 7 years we have treated 30 patients with malignant hypertension with hemodialysis. The diagnosis of the disease was made according to the criteria recommended by the Ministry of Public Welfare, Japan, as described below. These patients were divided into three groups according to the therapies. Group A (15 patients) were medicated with large doses of beta-blockers for the control of hypertension. Characteristic features of this group were abnormally high reninemia, hyponatremia, and severe hypertension which were not controlled by large doses of beta-blockers in combination with dialysis. Their body weights were quite subnormal. Twelve patients out of 15 had essential hypertension (EH) as an underlying disease, and the remaining 3 had chronic glomerulonephritis (CN). Ten patients out of 15 died of hypertensive heart failure or hypertensive cerebrovascular accidents. Group B (6 patients) were treated by beta-blockers intermittently. They showed good results responding well to the treatment; high reninemia was brought down to normal level by the administration of beta-blockers and dialysis. Their underlying diseases were EH (3 patients) and CN (3 patients). Group C (9 patients) did not receive beta-blockers, because hypertension was easily controlled by dialysis alone. In the Group C patients, normoreninemia, normonatremia, and a favorable clinical course were characteristic. Their underlying disease was CN in all. From these results, it is concluded that the factors influencing the prognosis of te disease may be the existence of EH as an underlying disease, high reninemia, and hyponatremia which are not correctable either by administration of beta-blockers or by hemodialysis.",

The advantage of such a procedure as an useful tool to determine the pharmacodynamic profile of the new agents is described in detail.", 
    "16": "In open-chest pentothal-chloralose anesthetized dogs, plasma catecholamine and cyclic AMP levels were evaluated in the aortic and coronary sinus blood, during stimulations of the left ansa subclavia (1, 2, and 4 Hz). Basal aortic and coronary sinus catecholamine levels were respectively 0.373 +/- 0.090 and 0.259 +/- 0.048 ng/mL and cyclic AMP levels averaged 21.4 +/- 1.4 and 20.9 +/- 1.6 pmol/mL. Statistically significant increases in cyclic AMP levels were induced by sympathetic stimulations at 1 Hz (2.0 +/- 0.6 pmol/mL, 2 Hz (2.5 +/- 1.2 pmol/mL) and 4 Hz (6.5 +/- 1.5 pmol/mL), concomitantly with elevations of coronary sinus catecholamine levels. Sotalol (5 mg/kg) abolished the increases in coronary sinus cyclic AMP levels induced in coronary sinus cyclic AMP output averaged 282 +/- 30 pmol/min (1 Hz), 662 +/- 160 pmol/min (2 Hz), and 1679 +/- 242 pmol/min (4 Hz). Sympathetically induced cyclic AMP output (4Hz) was blunted by sotalol (-81 +/- 14 pmol/min). Aortic cyclic AMP levels were not significantly influenced by stellate stimulation. Intense correlations were found between increased in coronary sinus plasma catecholamines and cyclic AMP concentration levels (r = 0.81, slope - 1.45, ordinate = -1.42, n = 15) as well as between delta cyclic AMP output versus delta catecholamine output values in the coronary sinus (r = 0.93. slope output levels. Intracoronary infusion of phenylephrine (10 micrograms/min) or nitroprusside (200 micrograms/min) had no influence on cyclic AMP plasma levels whereas aortic and coronary sinus levels were respectively increased 5.5 +/- 1.9 and 7.3 +/- 1.4 pmol/mL during the administration of isoproterenol (5 micrograms/min). These data suggested that plasma cyclic AMP constitutes a sensitive index of cardiac beta-adrenergic activity elicited by the release of endogenous catecholamine during stellate stimulations.", 
    "17": "The preventative effects of betablockers and captopril on the development of genetic hypertension in genetically hypertensive rats, were studied after long-term daily dosage by forced feeding, from the 5th to the 20th week of age of the animals. Of the drugs studied, captopril, atenolol and propranolol limited the development significantly, but pindolol only had a modest effect and acebutolol was ineffective. No correlation was found between the degree of prevention of genetic hypertension and the intensity of betablockade. Atenolol and propranolol prevent genetic hypertension by I) reducing cardiac output, a reduction which is not neutralised by the simultaneous change in peripheral resistance, 2) decreasing plasma renin concentrations, and 3) limiting the development of myocardial hypertrophy. Captopril is very effective in preventing the development of genetic hypertension and acts: 1) by causing an early and lasting fall in peripheral resistance related to the suppression of Angiotensin II, and possibly by potentialising the vasodilatation of bradykinins and, 2) by limiting myocardial hypertrophy.", 
    "18": "To assess whether betablockers (BB) would better control blood pressure than central antihypertensive drugs (CAD) clonidine or alpha methyldopa in hypertensive patients during exercise, comparable triangular ergometric bicycle exercises were performed by the same patients while their hypertension had been controlled at rest either with CAD or BB. Blood pressure, heart rate and blood lactate before and during exercise were compared in II patients treated with metoprolol and CAD, and in 12 other patients treated with atenolol and CAD. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure on exercise were significantly lower with BB than with CAD. Heart rate and rate-pressure product were always lower with BB than with CAD. Blood lactate increase was greater with BB than with CAD. The work capacity was greater with atenolol than with CAD, but comparable between metoprolol and CAD.", 
    "19": "The hemodynamic effects of propranolol, pindolol and practolol were investigated i conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR) ard cardiac output (CO) were measured and total peripheral resistance (TPR) was calculated. CO was determined by the modified dye dilution method using an arterio-venous shunt between the left carotid artery and the right jugular vein. Intraperitoneal administration of propranolol (5 mg/kg), pindolol (0.1 mg/kg) or practolol (50 mg/kg) caused a sustained antihypertensive effect of a similar degree. The antihypertensive effect of propranolol (20-30 mmHg, 0.5-8 hr) was attributed to an early decrease of CO (0.5-4 hr) followed by a reduction of TPR (6-8 hr), while that of pindolol or practolol (30-50 mmHg, 0.5-8 hr, 30 mmHg, 2-8 hr) was apparently related to a reduction of TPR with a CO increment. HR decreased with propranolol but increased with pindolol, while only slight changes were observed with practolol. Antihypertensive effects of propranolol, pindolol or practolol were associated with characteristic hemodynamic changes.", 
    "20": "1 The influence of acebutolol, atenolol, pindolol and timolol on human lymphocyte cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its stimulation by isoprenaline in vitro has been studied. 2 Acebutolol and atenolol (10(-8)-10(-6)M) had no significant influence on lymphocyte cAMP levels or on isoprenaline-stimulated increase in cAMP. 3 Pindolol and timolol significantly antagonised the effect of isoprenaline, and pA2 values were calculated to be 8.12 and 8.04 respectively. This suggests that beta 2-adrenoceptors are involved in this phenomenon. 4 Only pindolol produced a significant increase in lymphocyte cAMP, which is consistent with its partial agonist activity.", 
    "21": "1 This study on 21 neurosurgical patients was set up to investigate the extent to which four chronically administered beta-adrenoceptor blockers, propranolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol and atenolol, cross and blood-brain barrier and enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue. The concentration in the CSF of the three lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers, propranolol, oxprenolol and metoprolol, approximated to the free drug concentration in the plasma, and was a poor predictor of brain concentration. These three lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers appeared in brain tissue at concentrations 10-20 times greater than that of hydrophilic atenolol. The approximate brain/plasma ratio for propranolol was 26, for oxprenolol 50, for metoprolol 12 and for atenolol 0.2. 2 The low concentration of atenolol in brain tissue is possibly responsible for the low incidence of central nervous system-related side effects in patients on this agent compared to lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers.", 
    "22": "In the presence of 17 beta-oestradiol, prenalterol, a beta-selective adrenoceptor agonist, caused a dose-dependent relaxation of the isolated, pilocarpine-contracted guinea-pig trachea. This effect was blocked by the antagonists propranolol (non-selective) and practolol (beta 1-selective) but not by IPS 339 [(t-butylamino-3-ol-2-propyl)oximino-9-fluorene HCl] (beta 2-selective). The relaxing effect of terbutaline, a beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist, was more efficiently blocked by IPS 339 than by practolol. These data support the hypothesis that the guinea-pig trachea contains both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation and that the beta 1-adrenoceptors are selectively stimulated by prenalterol. The efficacy of prenalterol was less than that of terbutaline, thus confirming its partial agonistic activity. In the absence of 17 beta-oestradiol, the ability of prenalterol to relax the pilocarpine-contracted trachea was lost. It is suggested that 17 beta-oestradiol may act as a functional antagonist to pilocarpine as it caused a partial relaxation itself.", 
    "23": "We investigated the possibility of a rebound increase in sympathetic response after stopping beta-blocker treatment by measuring heart rate under conditions of increased sympathetic drive, as provided by standing with vasodilatation, or the Valsalva manoeuvure. Significant rebound increases in heart rate were observed after stopping propranolol given for one or more weeks but not when given for only four days. The amplitude of the rebound heart rate relative to the control heart rate off beta-blockers was similar after propranolol, atenolol, oxprenolol, or acebutolol, and in hyperthyroid subjects.", 
    "24": "Concerning the effects of beta-receptor blocking agents (beta-RB) on serum lipids levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were determined in 237 consecutive male patients with coronarographically proven coronary artery disease. 43% (n = 101) of all patients were taking beta-RB. The percentage of factors apt to influence serum lipid levels and the extent of coronary artery disease were similar in the subsets with (group 1) and without (group 2) chronical beta-RB therapy.-The mean values of total cholesterol (group 1: 242 mg%, group 2: 239 mg%) and HDL cholesterol (group 1: 42 mg%, group 2: 41 mg%) were nearly identical; there were, however, significantly enhanced triglyceride concentration under beta-RB therapy (group 1: 222 mg%, group 2: 184 mg%, p less than 0.0125). This difference was most pronounced in patients with one-vessel disease. Patients treated with beta-1-selective RB had lower triglyceride levels than those treated with nonselective RB (208 mg% vs. 222 mg%, n.s.). In accordance with findings of other authors, these data might indicate that serum triglycerides are elevated by chronical administration of beta-RB. It should be a topic of further investigations if the present results can be interpreted the way that chronical application of beta-RB might favour development and/or deterioration of coronary artery disease.", 
    "25": "The beta 1-adrenergic receptor of rat Sertoli cells was characterized by measurement of the ability of adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists to stimulate cAMP accumulation in Sertoli cells from 18-day-old rats. Epinephrine, norepinephrine and isoproterenol stimulate cAMP accumulation in Sertoli cells which is not additive with maximal doses of FSH and which is age-dependent, beta-antagonists, alprenolol, hydroxybenzylpindolol or propranolol inhibit isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation while alpha-adrenergic antagonists have no effect. Dobutamine and soterenol stimulated cAMP accumulation to a greater extent than albuterol and metoproterenol. Finally, the stimulatory effects of isoproterenol and zinterol are both more sensitive to inhibition by beta 1-antagonists than by beta 2-antagonists. Taken together these data indicate the presence of a beta 1-adrenergic receptor in Sertoli cells which is coupled to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "26": "A study was undertaken in 54 renal allograft recipients to evaluate the multiple factors contributing to the pathogenesis of hyperlipidemia after renal transplantation. Serum triglyceride concentrations were found to correlate positively with the cummulative prednisolone dose, and with abdominal skin fold thickness. Serum cholesterol concentrations correlated significantly with serum creatinine concentrations. Patients on beta adrenergic blocking agents had lower plasma free fatty acid concentrations and patients on diuretics had higher serum triglyceride concentrations. The implication of these findings are discussed.", 
    "27": "A study was conducted on the effects of perhexiline on myocardial phosphorylase activity, myocardial catecholamine content and heart rate. Phosphorylase a activity and heart rate were investigated as an indicator of sympathetic nerve tone in order to clarify the characteristic of perhexiline with regard to the effects on myocardial metabolism in hyperthyroid rats and catecholamine deficient rats. Myocardial catecholamine and phosphorylase a activity were measured by von Euler's method and Cori's method respectively. Conclusion of this study are summarized as follows: 1) Perhexiline reduces the heart rate, and its effect is not always dependent upon the changes in myocardial norepinephrine content. 2) Perhexiline reduces myocardial phosphorylase a activity. It cannot be always said that the reduction is dependent upon the changes in myocardial norepinephrine. 3) Though slightly different from propranolol and dichloroisoproterenol, perhexiline possesses cardiac effects resembling beta-blockers.", 
    "28": "A disruption of the blood-aqueous barrier in rabbit eyes was elicited by use of topical prostaglandin E2(PGE2), infrared irradiation of the iris, or by subcutaneous alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). The aqueous flare provoked was measured quantitatively with a photoelectric instrument. The effect of the (topical) beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol maleate on the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier was tested. Timolol applied topically in very large doses had no effect on exogenously administered PGE2. However, even in a very small concentration applied topically, timolol reduced the flare response to both infrared irradiation and alpha-MSH. These results support the theory that the effect of alpha-MSH and infrared irradiation on the blood-aqueous barrier is dependent on intact beta-adrenergic receptor sites.", 
    "29": "The development of adrenergic responsiveness in ovarian granulosa cells cultured in the presence of androstenedione was investigated. Progesterone production by granulosa cells obtained from immature hypophysectomized diethylstilbestrol-treated rats was stimulated by FSH, but was only minimally affected by various adrenergic agents. In contrast, FSH treatment for 2 days in vivo or in vitro resulted in an increase in the adrenergic responsiveness of granulosa cells. Subsequent treatment with (-)epinephrine, (-)norepinephrine, or (-)isoproterenol (a potent beta-adrenergic agonist) resulted in time- and dose-dependent increases in progesterone production. The adrenergic agents enhanced the effects of hCG and PRL with respect to progesterone production, but were without effect on estrogen production or the maintenance of LH/hCG receptors in FSH-primed granulosa cells. A selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist (terbutaline) stimulated progesterone production in FSH-treated granulosa cells, whereas a beta 1-agonist (dobutamine) was 10,000-fold less effective. Furthermore, progesterone production induced by (-)epinephrine was blocked by a selective beta 2-antagonist (IPS 339), but the beta 1-antagonist (practolol) was 7,000-fold less effective. These results suggest that FSH treatment in vivo and in vitro increases beta 2-adrenergic responsiveness in ovarian granulosa cells and that this functional responsiveness is coupled to progesterone, but not to estrogen, biosynthesis.", 
    "30": "Groups of littermate rabbits were treated for various periods up to 6 weeks with twice daily subcutaneous injections of saline, D-propranolol, DL-propranolol, or metoprolol, the latter two at doses equivalent to those used in clinical therapy. Investigations were made at a sufficient time (20-24 hours after the most recent dose) to ensure that the drugs would have been eliminated from the body, so that any observed changes would represent an adaptation to treatment, not effects due to the presence of the drugs. The ECG was recorded in vivo at regular intervals during treatment. After several days, Q-Tc was prolonged by the beta-blockers, reaching a peak effect at about 3 weeks from the start of treatment, and returned to control values at 3 weeks after cessation of treatment. Action potential duration, measured in vitro by intracellular recording, was also prolonged uniformly in atria and ventricles over a similar time-course, unrelated to cardiac frequency, but shortened in distal Purkinje cells. Peak tension was not altered in propranolol-adapted papillary muscles, but the relationship of rate of rise of tension was steeper. It is concluded that these effects represent a myocardial adaptation to prolonged beta-blockade.", 
    "31": "Electrocardiographic changes induced by Labetalol, a drug blocking alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, have been studied in 10 anesthetized rats. Authors observed that Labetalol has: 1) slightly negative chronotropic action; 2)slightly negative dromotropic action on both atrio-ventricular and intraventricular conduction; 3) effective antiarrhythmic and alpha-blocking action and, inconstantly, 4) the so-called \"intrinsic sympathicomimetic action\" (I.S.A.), typical of several beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "32": "In order to characterize the adrenergic control of pancreatic A cell, the effect on the glucagon secretion of three sympathomimetic substances (epinephrine, isoproterenol, phenylephrine) and two adrenergic blockers (propranolol and phentolamine) have been separately examined by the isolated perfused rat pancreas. The study was performed in basal state and during glucagon hypersecretion induced by arginine or glucopenia. Epinephrine and isoproterenol infusion determined a prompt an sustained glucagon release both in the basal state and during glucagon hypersecretion. The effect of phenylephrine infusion was slight. In the presence of propranolol, glucagon secretion induced by metabolic stimulus was significantly depressed. The glucagon secretion in the same experimental conditions was insignificantly enhanced by phentolamine. Finally propranolol infusion reverse the glucagon secretion induced by phenylephrine. In conclusion the pancreatic glucagon secretion in our model of study is clearly induced by B adrenergic receptor stimulation.", 
    "33": "A multicenter double-blind randomized study was carried out to compare the effect of timolol (10 mg twice daily) with that of placebo in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. Treatment was started seven to 28 days after infarction in 1884 patients (945 taking timolol, and 939 placebo), who represented 52 per cent of those evaluated for entry; the patients were followed for 12 to 33 months (mean, 17). There were 152 deaths in the placebo group and 98 in the timolol group. When deaths that occurred during treatment or within 28 days of withdrawal were considered, the cumulated sudden-death rate over 33 months was 13.9 per cent in the placebo group and 7.7 per cent in the timolol group--a reduction of 44.6 per cent (P = 0.0001). The cumulated reinfarction rate was 20.1 per cent in the placebo group and 14.4 per cent in the timolol group (P = 0.0006). We conclude that long-term treatment with timolol in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction reduces mortality and the rate of reinfarction.", 
    "34": "The agonist specificity pattern of the beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase in glial primary cultures was not typical of either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The dose-response curves for adrenaline did not correspond to simple mass action kinetics and their computer analysis suggests the presence of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase (58 plus or minus 17% and 42 plus or minus 17% respectively). Similar properties of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclases were found by computer analysis of the dose-response curves for isoprenaline in the presence of a constant concentration of practolol (a selective beta 1 antagonist) (55 plus or minus 10% and 45 plus or minus 10% of beta 1- and beta 2-sensitive adenylate cyclase respectively). The curves for displacement of [3H]dihydroalprenolol by practolol confirm these results. For purpose of comparison, the beta-adrenergic receptors of meningeal cells in cultures were subjected to similar analysis. The results clearly showed that these cells exclusively contained beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "35": "The neurotransmitter-sensitive adenylate cyclases, respectively present in the dissociated cells of new-born mouse cerebral cortex (containing both neuronal and glial cells) and in a homogeneous population of glial cells, were compared. The dissociated cells from the cerebral cortex of new-born mice were found to contain Ca2+-, dopamine-, serotonin- and purinergic-sensitive adenylate cyclases. The dopaminergic receptor involved was extensively characterized and was similar to that described in adult animals. Beta-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase was present but was poorly active. After 3 weeks in culture, the neurons disappeared and a homogeneous population of glial cells was obtained (96% of the cells synthetized glial fibrillary acidic protein). These glial cells contained a highly potent beta-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase, and adenosine- adn Ca2+-sensitive enzymes. Ca2+ stimulation of the adenylate cyclase was due to the presence of calmodulin. We suggested that the dopaminergic- and serotoninergic-sensitive adenylate cyclases which disappeared during culture are probably localized in neuronal cells. The presence of Ca2+-, adenosine- and beta-adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclases in glial cells does not exclude their presence in neuronal cells. For comparison, the same experiments were conducted on meningeal layers of new-born mice and on meningeal cells in culture. They both contained beta-adrenergic- and purinergic-sensitive adenylate cyclases.", 
    "36": "In conscious adrenalectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) propranolol (5 mg/kg s.c.) induced an acute and profound decrease in blood pressure and heart rate, the maximum effect occurring 15-30 min after propranolol administration. The decrease was associated with a fall in cardiac output. Rauwolscine pretreatment abolished the propranolol-induced hypotension but not the bradycardia. The fall in cardiac output was significantly reduced. These results suggest that in adrenalectomized SHR the hypotensive effect of propranolol is due to the modulation of catecholamine release from nerve terminals.", 
    "37": "Timolol, a non selective beta-blocker was used one daily at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg, in 60 hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure ranging from 100 to 120 mmHg. After 4 weeks of treatment, timolol had normalized diastolic blood pressure in 70% of patients ( less than 100 mmHg). compared to an initial treatment period with placebo (p less than 0.001). Tolerance of timolol was good, adverse clinical effects supervening in only 8% of patients (bradycardia, Raynaud's syndrome); no variation in laboratory values was observed.", 
    "38": "1. Glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, isoproterenol and phenylephrine each enhance glycogenolysis in isolated perfused rabbit livers and/or hepatocytes. 2. Such enhancement by epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol and phenylephrine is eliminated by propranolol but unaltered by phentolamine, suggesting that stimulation of glycogenolysis by each of these agents involves beta-adrenergic-mediated mechanism(s). 3. Data obtained with hepatocytes from 16--20-week-old rabbits and from 7--8-week-old rabbits are identical as far as enhancement of glycogenolysis by beta-adrenergic stimulation is concerned, implying that the nature of functional adrenergic receptors in rabbit liver does not change during the process of maturation.", 
    "39": "In the ambulatory of an internal specialist a number of patients suffering from angina pectoris or hypertonia together with arrhythmic troubles received an initial treatment with beta-blockers over a period of 21 days. In cases in which arrhythmia persisted after this initial period the treatment was continued for another 21 days with the addition of Depasan retard in function of a second medicament. This combined treatment in form of an open study was extended to a total number of 50 patients presenting ventricular extrasystolia in 45 cases and in 5 cases absolute arrhythmia in addition to the main disease. Treatment with Depasan retard showed good or satisfactory results in 39 out of 45 patients suffering from ventricular extrasystoles, whilst no effect could be obtained in the 5 cases with absolute arrhythmia. No signs of incompatibility or unwanted interactions were observed in the course of this open study. Based on these results it can be concluded that Depasan retard should be recommended in those cases where on account of persistent arrhythmical troubles and especially extrasystoles, during a treatment with beta-blockers in patients suffering from angina pectoris or hypertonia, and additional treatment with anti-arrhythmical medicaments appears to be indicated.", 
    "40": "A double-blind crossover study in seven patients with glaucoma and obstructive lung disease revealed a considerable and significant bronchoconstrictive side effect on topically administered timolol maleat. Comparative treatment of these patients with an ophthalmic solution containing 3% carbachol did not yield a statistically significant bronchial reaction. However, the observation of serious lung function impairment in three patients suggests that carbachol is not a safe alternative for the treatment of glaucoma in patients with obstructive lung disease. Whenever a deterioration of airway obstruction occurs in elderly patients, or bronchial asthma becomes manifest late in life, topically administered beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking and cholinergic agents must be considered causative factors: optimal communication between all physicians caring for glaucoma patients is an essential prerequisite.", 
    "41": "Minoxidil in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocker and a diuretic was used in 12 male hypertensive patients who did not respond to or who developed unpleasant side-effects from the available medications. Blood pressure was effectively controlled in 9 of the 12 patients at the end of the 14-week planned treatment programme. The main side-effects were weight gain in all the patients, oedema of the legs in 3 patients, hirsutism in 3 patients and palpitations in 2 patients. A disturbing side-effect was pericarditis with congestive cardiac failure in 1 patient. Minoxidil, in spite of its serious side-effects, is a valuable hypotensive agent in the treatment of male hypertensive patients who do not respond to or who develop unpleasant side-effects from the available hypotensive medications.", 
    "42": "The effects of right stellate ganglion stimulation (RSGS) on regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) and epicardial ST-segment elevation were investigated in the normal and ischemic myocardium of anesthetized dogs. In the non-ischemic areas and despite the augmentation of cardiac work resulting from the increase in heart rate and in myocardial contractile force, RSGS induced no significant changes in RMBF or in the endo/epi ratio. However, after suppression by atenolol of its chronotropic and inotropic effects, RSGS significantly increased the calculated coronary resistance and reduced RMBF, and combined atenolol + phenoxybenzamine treatments abolished these effects. In the ischemic areas, RSGS had no effect on RMBF, endo/epi and I/NI ratios but increased ST-segment elevation, an effect abolished by atenolol. We conclude that (1) during RSGS, alpha-adrenoreceptor-mediated coronary vasoconstriction contributes to oppose beta 1-myocardial stimulation effects on RMBF and endo/epi ratio, (2) further elevation of ST-segment by RSGS is due to enhancement of oxygen requirements by beta 1-adrenoreceptor stimulation.", 
    "43": "The effect of a beta-receptor-blocking drug (200 mg Acebutolol pr os) on exercise-stimulated extrabeats (ES) by an ergometrical test was studied in 56 subjects. A reduction of the frequency of premature beats to minimally 50% was considered to be a positive result, which was found in 32 subjects. The best result could be observed in old people, in supraventricular and in the case of a fairly low number of ES. On the other hand the effect was smaller in young people, in ventricular and in frequent extra beats. In three cases polytopic extrasystoles and sinus arrhytmia appeared, which were not observed before. The results give some therapeutical hints. Further they stress the necessity to test the effect of an antiarrhythmical treatment in the individual case."
