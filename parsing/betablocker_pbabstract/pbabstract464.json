Atenolol given alone at the dose of 50 to 100 mg per day normalized the blood tension in 44 (55%) patients, in 26 cases (32.5%) the association of chlorthalidone 25 mg/day was required, and in the remaining 10 patients (12.5%) a third pharmacologic agent was needed. Patients who required the association of three agents (group C) had systolic arterial pressures significantly higher than those observed in patients treated with atenolol alone (group A) (176.6 +/- 14.3 vs 161.4 +/- 12.9 mmHg, p less than 0.01) and higher to those measured in patients who required the association of chlorthalidone (group B) (176.6 +/- 14.3 vs 162.8 +/- 15 mmHg, p less than 0.05). On the other hand the 44 hypertensive patients controlled with monotherapy showed a lower incidence of cardiovascular complications (6.8% in group A, 38.5% in group B, and 30% in group C, p = 0.0042), they required acute treatment for hypertensive crisis (34.1% in group A, 73.1% in group B, and 66.7% in group C, p = 0.0041), and they showed electrocardiographic signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or overload (26.2% in group A, 60% in group B, and 42.9% in group C, p = 0.0228).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "10": "Acute immobilization stress increased serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels, the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic/serotonin ratio, and the number of [3H]ketanserin binding sites, representing serotonin-2 type receptors, in the rat frontal cortex. Peripheral administration of propranolol or central administration of 6-hydroxydopamine abolished the stress induced elevation of [3H]ketanserin binding sites. Treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine did not affect the increase in serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels, and enhanced the increase in the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin ratio produced by stress. Conversely, chemical serotoninergic denervation with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine had no influence on the stress-induced elevation of [3H]ketanserin binding sites, but abolished the serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid increase produced by stress. These results suggest that an intact serotoninergic system is not essential for serotonin-2 type receptor regulation during stress. Instead, the noradrenergic system, most probably through stimulation of beta-adrenoreceptors, may control the regulation of [3H]ketanserin binding sites in the rat frontal cortex during acute stress.",

After a single-blind placebo phase, patients were randomized to receive nicorandil or atenolol using a double-dummy technique. Patients took nicorandil 10 mg twice daily or atenolol 50 mg once daily for the first 3 weeks, and if no adverse effects were encountered they took nicorandil 20 mg twice daily or atenolol 100 mg once daily, for the final 3-week phase. Treadmill exercise tests were performed at the end of each treatment phase immediately before and 2 hours after the morning dose of medication. Groups were demographically similar. Placebo exercise times were 7.06 (0.60) minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in the nicorandil group and 6.81 (0.47) minutes in the atenolol group. After 6 weeks, improvements in exercise time were before dosing: +1.47 (0.40) minutes with nicorandil (p less than 0.005) and +1.33 (0.29) minutes with atenolol (p less than 0.001). Improvements after therapy was administered were +2.45 (0.41) minutes with nicorandil (p less than 0.001) and +2.37 (0.43) minutes with atenolol (p less than 0.0001). Whereas, the predose peak exercise double product (heart rate X systolic blood pressure mm Hg/100) was reduced with atenolol (-43.6 units; p less than 0.001), an increase (+7.56 units; difference not significant) was noted with nicorandil.

The decision, whether or not an invasive diagnostics is necessary and which medicaments are prescribed is based on the results of non-invasive diagnostic measures. The beta-blockers are the most important group of medicaments. Anticoagulants and antiarrhythmic drugs are used within limited and defined indication.

    "13": "The relative safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of adenosine, lignocaine, disopyramide, flecainide, and sotalol for termination of stable, induced ventricular tachycardia was assessed in serial trials. Ventricular tachycardia was terminated by pacing if it persisted 10-15 min after the end of drug administration. 24 patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia were studied. Ventricular tachycardia was terminated by a drug in 35 of 105 trials. In 6 patients no drug terminated the arrhythmia. Adenosine did not terminate tachycardia or have any serious adverse effect in any patient; both flecainide and disopyramide were significantly more effective than lignocaine, but flecainide had significantly more severe adverse effects than lignocaine. Lignocaine was the safest drug and should continue to be used as first-line drug therapy for stable ventricular tachycardia. Disopyramide should be considered as second-line treatment. DC cardioversion is necessary for unstable ventricular tachycardia, and its availability must be ensured before attempted pharmacological intervention.", 
    "14": "The effects of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation on intracellular pH (pHi) and Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were investigated in isolated rat cardiomyocytes with fluorescence dyes, BCECF and fura-2, respectively. In the presence of 5 or 25 mM HCO3- norepinephrine (NE) increased pHi in a dose-dependent manner. Intracellular alkalinization was inhibited by prazosin and phentolamine but not by yohimbine. NE-induced alkalinization was inhibited in the presence of a Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor (5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA)), a C kinase inhibitor (H-7) or a calmodulin inhibitor (W-7), or in the absence of extracellular Na+. NE also increased [Ca2+]i following the pHi increase, which was abolished in the absence of extracellular Na+ or Ca2+. This Ca2+ influx was inhibited by HMA but not by diltiazem (10(-5) M). Thus, we conclude that alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation enhances Na+/H+ exchange by activation of C kinase, thereby allowing intracellular alkalinization, and that subsequent activation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange increases Ca2+ influx.",

A discussion on drug treatment of these conditions was arranged by the Norwegian Society of Cardiology and the Department of Pharmacotherapeutics, University of Oslo, soon after preliminary results of the GISSI II study were available. Relatively simple rules were agreed for the use of analgetics, nitrates and fibrinolytic agents. The last are used only after established myocardial injury. Consensus was also reached on the restricted use of calcium antagonists, inotropic agents and diuretics. There was disagreement concerning the dosage of heparin and the exact use of betablockers, aspirin, warfarin, ACE-inhibitors, magnesium and antiarrhythmics.",

Use of glyceryl trinitrate and beta blocking drugs varies considerably, as does the use of oral anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors. Practice also varies in unstable angina. However, a combination of aspirin, intravenous nitrate, and betablockers is common. Several treatment regimens have an uncertain scientific foundation. The varying practice reflects international scientific debate.", 
    "17": "Lipoprotein cholesterol data from the Framingham Heart Study show that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are important in determining risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Increased LDL and decreased HDL cholesterol levels are associated with an increase in CAD. Such relations are independent of the usual coronary risk factors, such as cigarette use and hypertension. A 1% greater LDL value is associated with slightly more than a 2% increase in CAD over 6 years; a 1% lower HDL value is associated with a 3 to 4% increase in CAD. Even at total cholesterol levels less than 200 mg/dl, lower HDL levels are associated with increased myocardial infarction rates in both men and women. Death from CAD is increased when HDL levels are low, but there is no such relation between HDL level and cancer death. Triglyceride levels were associated with CAD in Framingham men and women, but the association was no longer significant in men after adjustment for HDL levels. The major determinants for greater HDL levels in Framingham participants included female sex, estrogen use, leanness, greater alcohol intake, exercise, abstinence from smoking and lack of diuretic or beta-blocker use.",

It also inhibited alkyl-PAF-induced aggregation of human platelets with an IC50 of 3.00 microM, but it did not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid, the thromboxane A2 agonist U46619, or the Ca ionophore A23187, at concentrations up to 400 microM. Furthermore, SM-10661 antagonized [3H]-C16-PAF binding to rabbit platelets competitively, with an IC50 of 1.0 microM. SM-10661 protected against alkyl-PAF-induced lethality in mice with an ID50 of 6.0 mg/kg intravenously or 24 mg/kg orally. In guinea pig, SM-10661 inhibited the alkyl-PAF (0.1 micrograms/kg)-induced increase in bronchial pressure, with an ID50 of 0.7 mg/kg intravenously or 15 mg/kg orally. Bronchial hyperreactivity to bombesin after the infusion of alkyl-PAF was also inhibited dose-dependently by the infusion of SM-10661, with an ID50 of 25 mg/kg. In addition, SM-10661 inhibited alkyl-PAF (0.01 micrograms/kg)-induced hypotension in rats, with an ID50 of 0.36 mg/kg intravenously or 33 mg/kg orally. SM-10661, when given orally, showed rapid absorption and good duration of pharmacological activity in rats and rabbits.", 
    "19": "Rats with chronic portal hypertension have an increased gastric mucosal blood flow and an impaired acid secretory response to pentagastrin stimulation. This study investigated the effects of propranolol, a drug widely used in the treatment of portal hypertension, on gastric mucosal blood flow and acid secretion in portal hypertensive rats with partial portal vein occlusion. In study I, gastric mucosal blood flow, measured by hydrogen gas clearance, and acid output were determined in basal conditions and after the administration of propranolol (0.3 mg/kg/min) or vehicle infusion in portal hypertensive and sham-operated rats. Gastric mucosal blood flow was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) in portal hypertensive rats than in sham-operated rats, and it was significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) after propranolol infusion in portal hypertensive rats (39 +/- 2 vs. 35 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm). Basal acid output was not significantly modified with propranolol infusion, either in portal hypertensive or sham-operated animals. In study II, acid output was measured in portal hypertensive rats in basal conditions, during pentagastrin (20 micrograms/kg/hr) infusion and after the combined infusion of pentagastrin and propranolol (or vehicle). Pentagastrin infusion significantly increased (p less than 0.001) acid output, but propranolol did not modify stimulated gastric acid secretion. In conclusion, propranolol induced a slight but significant reduction in gastric mucosal blood flow and did not change basal or stimulated gastric acid secretion.", 
    "20": "We compared the effects of diltiazem sustained-release formulation and metoprolol on diurnal ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and plasma lipoprotein levels. Forty-nine patients with primary hypertension were included in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, and 44 completed the trial. Both diltiazem and metoprolol significantly lowered office (p less than 0.001) and diurnal ambulatory BP (p less than 0.01). After 16 weeks of therapy with diltiazem, mean ambulatory BP decreased 10/7 mm Hg, whereas metoprolol lowered BP by 16/10 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 for systolic BP and p less than 0.01 for diastolic BP). Moreover, metoprolol seemed to induce a greater reduction in morning BP at work. Although diltiazem had no effect on lipid levels, treatment with metoprolol was associated with a significant rise in triglyceride levels (p less than 0.001 vs baseline and diltiazem), total cholesterol levels (p less than 0.05 vs baseline), atherogenic index (p less than 0.05 vs baseline and diltiazem) and very low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol levels (p less than 0.001 vs baseline and diltiazem) and a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (p less than 0.01 vs baseline and p less than 0.001 vs diltiazem). These data suggest that both diltiazem and metoprolol provide adequate office BP control. The deleterious effects of metoprolol on lipid and lipoprotein levels may counterbalance its beneficial effects on reduction of ambulatory BP.", 
    "21": "beta-Adrenergic antagonists taken orally adversely alter plasma lipid profiles. This study was designed to determine whether 0.5% topical timolol maleate has a similar effect. Forty volunteers who were not using medications known to alter plasma lipid levels were recruited for an unmasked study in which each subject served as his or her own control. Twelve subjects did not complete the study because of ocular and systemic side effects or extraneous factors. Twenty-eight subjects used topical timolol for an average of 76 days, with two 12-hour fasting plasma specimens obtained at the beginning and end of the period. Mean total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change significantly with treatment. Triglyceride values increased 12%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased 9%; and the total cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio increased 8%. Higher baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were associated with larger reductions in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of this magnitude have been estimated to increase the risk of coronary artery disease by 21%.", 
    "22": "A prolongation of the ventricular effective refractory period in response to cholinergic agonists or vagal stimulation has been demonstrated in a number of in vivo animal models. However, exposure of isolated myocardial tissues obtained from these hearts to as much as 10(-4) M acetylcholine has been shown to produce essentially no change in action potential duration or effective refractory period. The discrepancy between the in vivo and in vitro findings generally has been explained on the basis of accentuated antagonism, whereby parasympathetic agonists exert their influence through antagonism of the effects of beta-adrenergic tone in vivo. The fact that acetylcholine exerts little if any direct effect on the electrical activity of ventricular myocardium, although well accepted, is based exclusively on studies performed using endocardial preparations. Our recent demonstration of major electrophysiological differences between canine ventricular endocardium and epicardium prompted us to examine the effects of acetylcholine and the role of accentuated antagonism in these two tissue types. Using standard microelectrode techniques, we show that acetylcholine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) has little if any effect in canine ventricular endocardium but a pronounced effect to either prolong or markedly abbreviate action potential duration and effective refractory period in epicardium. These effects of acetylcholine on epicardium are attended by an accentuation of the spike and dome morphology of the action potential, are readily reversed with atropine, fail to appear when epicardium is pretreated with the transient outward current blocker 4-aminopyridine, are accentuated in the presence of isoproterenol (10(-7) to 5 x 10(-6) M), and persist in the presence of propranolol. Isoproterenol-induced abbreviation of action potential duration and effective refractory period is also shown to be more pronounced in epicardium than in endocardium; equimolar concentrations of acetylcholine completely antagonize the effects of isoproterenol in endocardium and epicardium. We conclude that acetylcholine exerts important direct effects on the electrical response of canine ventricular myocardium, which are accentuated in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists. Our findings suggest the differential response of epicardium and endocardium to acetylcholine is due to the presence of a transient outward current-mediated spike and dome morphology in the epicardial action potential. Finally, the data suggest that acetylcholine may exert antiarrhythmic as well as arrhythmogenic effects through its actions to alter conduction and refractoriness.", 
    "23": "The role of adrenoceptors in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the exercise-induced changes in plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), corticosterone, free fatty acids (FFA), and blood glucose was investigated in rats. Exercise consisted of strenuous swimming against a countercurrent for 15 min. Before, during, and after swimming, blood samples were withdrawn through a permanent heart catheter for determination of E, NE, corticosterone, FFA, and glucose, In control rats receiving artificial cerebrospinal fluid through permanent bilateral cannulas into the PVN, the levels of all blood components increased during exercise. Infusion of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine into the PVN completely reduced the exercise-induced increases in blood glucose and plasma corticosterone concentrations. Plasma NE, E, and FFA were not affected. Infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol into the PVN reduced blood glucose and plasma NE concentrations. Plasma E, corticosterone, and FFA remained unchanged. It is concluded that alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the PVN are involved in the central nervous regulation of blood glucose levels during exercise, partly by influencing sympathetic outflow. alpha-Adrenoceptors in the PVN play an important role in the release of corticosterone during exercise.", 
    "24": "The role of hypothalamic adrenoceptors in the exercise-induced alterations of plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and corticosterone concentrations was investigated in rats. Exercise consisted of strenuous swimming against a counter-current for 15 min. Before, during, and after swimming, blood samples were withdrawn through a permanent heart catheter for determination of E, NE, and corticosterone. In control rats E, NE, and corticosterone levels were all increased during exercise. Infusion of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine through permanent bilateral cannulas into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) immediately before exercise reduced the exercise-induced increase in plasma E without affecting NE. Infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol into the VMH enhanced plasma E and attenuated plasma NE increases. Infusion of phentolamine into the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) led to enhanced NE and unchanged E concentrations, whereas infusion of timolol into the LHA caused a potentiation of the increase in plasma E without an effect on NE. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were not affected. The results suggest that 1) alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamus influence peripheral catecholamine release, and 2) E and NE responses to exercise can be dissociated by interference of the central nervous system.", 
    "25": "The purpose of this study was to adjudicate whether concomitant manipulation of inotropic state and arterial elastance influences linear indices of regional contractility. Fifteen autonomically denervated open-chest porcine hearts were instrumented with midmyocardial ultrasonic crystals and aortic and left ventricular chamber microamanometers. Linear left anterior descending coronary artery regional stroke work vs preload relationships (RSW) were generated by 10-sec vena caval occlusion at control and altered contractile states (either dopamine, 5 micrograms/kg/min, or propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg) and following arterial elastance variation (phenylephrine or nitroprusside), effecting an average 30% change in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Global contractility (dP/dt) was doubled (227% of control) by dopamine and halved (35% of control) by propranolol at constant preload (end-diastolic volume, end-diastolic pressure) and afterload (MAP). Regional contractility (RSW slope) was increased from 135 +/- 11 to 211 +/- 28, P less than 0.01, by dopamine, but unchanged with propranolol (106 +/- 10 vs 118 +/- 14, NS). Bidirectional changes in aortic elastance depressed the dopamine-augmented RSW slope (115 +/- 17, nitroprusside; 132 +/- 14, phenylephrine; P less than 0.01 vs dopamine). These differences were attenuated by propranolol infusion (98 +/- 7, nitroprusside; 132 +/- 9, phenylephrine; NS vs propranolol). Thus, optimizing ventriculoarterial coupling should supersede simple afterload manipulation in perioperative cardiac support.", 
    "26": "Cardiovascular and peripheral adaptations to an aerobic conditioning program were studied in 30 hypertensive adults taking either placebo, beta 1-selective beta-adrenergic blocker (metoprolol) or beta 1-nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker (propranolol). The placebo group increased aerobic capacity (VO2max) 24% (p less than 0.002), largely explained by an increased peripheral arteriovenous (AV) oxygen difference with minimal changes in cardiac size and function. Resting blood pressure and total systemic resistance also decreased. The group taking a beta 1-selective beta blocker increased VO2max 8% (p less than 0.05), reduced resting blood pressure but had no significant change of AV oxygen difference or cardiac size or function. The group taking the beta 1-nonselective beta blocker propranolol had no increase in VO2max, no decrease in resting blood pressure and no cardiovascular or peripheral adaptations to the exercise program. Thus, beta 1-selective and beta 1-nonselective beta blockers attenuate conditioning in hypertensive patients to differing degrees, in each case by blocking peripheral mechanisms of conditioning.", 
    "27": "The role of pharmacologic interventions in acute myocardial infarction (i.e., a combination of intravenous nitroglycerin, intravenous beta-blocker, oral aspirin, and intravenous thrombolysis), has become more standardized, whereas the role of mechanical intervention remains to be defined. Mechanical intervention includes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and coronary artery bypass grafting. The number of carefully controlled, randomized trials is limited, particularly with surgery. Nevertheless, in optimal circumstances, when performed within the first few hours of myocardial infarction, surgery can be beneficial in reducing mortality, especially with anterior location of infarct. Surgery may not prevent reinfarction. However, the results of nonrandomized surgical trials done 10 years ago are difficult to compare with modern-day treatment of myocardial infarction with the availability of new agents and PTCA. Angioplasty can be performed safely in the acute phase of myocardial infarction but may not be the ideal choice for all patients. The results may be more optimal if performed when the patient is stable. Clinical factors associated with favorable and unfavorable outcomes have been identified. Mortality is not significantly affected by early versus late PTCA. Certain selected patients benefit from PTCA, particularly those in cardiogenic shock, in whom PTCA has made a dramatic improvement in outcome. To achieve maximal benefit, intervention should be performed early, within the first hours of symptoms. Further well-designed studies may help clarify the role mechanical techniques will play in future combinations of interventional therapy.", 
    "28": "To test whether a beta-blocker's pharmacokinetics has an effect on the development of the beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome, we compared response to exercise and isoproterenol after abrupt withdrawal of two beta-blockers, one with a short half-life (propranolol) and one with a long half-life (nadolol). Eight normal males participated in the randomized cross-over trial. They took propranolol, 40 mg every 6 hours for 6 days, and nadolol, 80 mg daily for 7 days. Exercise- and isoproterenol-induced changes in heart rate and pulse pressure were significantly less than control values during treatment with both drugs (p less than 0.05). Significant hypersensitivity of heart rate response was seen on days 2, 3, and 7 after propranolol withdrawal (p less than 0.05) and on day 6 after nadolol withdrawal (p less than 0.005). Hypersensitive responses to isoproterenol were seen after propranolol withdrawal; no evidence of hypersensitivity to isoproterenol was seen after nadolol withdrawal. The area under the heart rate response, time curve after nadolol withdrawal was significantly less than that after propranolol withdrawal (20.3 beats/min.day vs 44.9 beats/min.day, respectively, (p less than 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation between the degree of hypersensitivity and nadolol pharmacokinetic half-life (r = -0.80, p less than 0.02). We conclude that abrupt withdrawal of a beta-blocker with a long half-life may protect against the development of the beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "29": "Altogether 105 patients were investigated 1.5-2 mos after myocardial infarction. They were divided into 2 groups: 1) 57 patients on nitrates or anapriline for one year; 2) 48 patients on acetylsalicylic acid (0.25 g/day) and nitrates by strict indications. Patients of the both groups performed physical exercises for one year by the methods developed at the All-Union Cardiology Research Center. The differences between Groups 1 and 2 were statistically insignificant in deaths (3.5 and 4.2%, respectively), recurrent myocardial infarctions (8.8 and 6.3%), CHD exacerbations (12.2 and 20.8%), higher tolerance, performance volume, double product, and threshold oxygen consumption. It was concluded that during a year therapy in patients with myocardial infarction who performed physical exercises, the long-term antianginal therapy chosen on an individual basis had no advantages over low-dose acetylsalicylic acid and a single use of nitrates (according to strict indications).", 
    "30": "Some thermodynamic and structural aspects of propranolol-DPPC liposomes interaction were investigated by DSC and X-ray diffraction: the lamellar arrangement of the lipid matrix remains intact even at high concentrations of the drug (until 1:1 drug/lipid molar ratio). However, the bilayer thickness increases significantly and the chains become perpendicular to the lamellar planes, for increasing drug content. At still higher propranolol concentrations a hexagonal phase occurs followed by a lamellar phase, in which the liposomes are destroyed. Moreover, the presence of propranolol has been found to impart fluidity to the lipid matrix.", 
    "31": "1. Bradykinin (BK) instilled directly into the airway lumen caused bronchoconstriction in anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated guinea-pigs in the presence of propranolol (1 mg kg-1 i.v.). The geometric mean dose of BK required to produce 100% increase in airway opening pressure (PD100) was 22.9 nmol (95% c.i. 11.7-44.6 nmol). 2. The dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK was significantly shifted to the left by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril (5 and 50 nmol instillation, PD100 = 3.0, 95% c.i. 0.98-8.9, and 2.0 nmol, 95% c.i. 0.65-6.2 nmol, respectively). 3. The neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (5 and 50 nmol instillation) also shifted the dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK; the PD100 values = 2.2 (95% c.i. 0.40-11.7) and 1.8 nmol (95% c.i. 0.87-3.5 nmol), respectively. 4. After pretreatment with captopril (50 nmol) and phosphoramidon (50 nmol) in combination, the dose-response curve for the effect of instilled BK (PD100 = 1.1 nmol, 95% c.i. 0.37-3.2 nmol) was similar to that obtained in the presence of each inhibitor used alone. 5. The kinase I inhibitor, DL-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropionic acid (50 nmol instillation) failed to alter the dose-response curve to instilled BK (PD100 = 14.6 nmol, 95% c.i. 6.7-32.0 nmol). 6. These data suggest that both ACE and NEP degrade BK in the airway lumen, but that kininase I is not involved.",

In the presence of 3 mM glucose, many ATP-sensitive K+ channels are open in the beta-cell membrane. Under these conditions, phentolamine inhibited 86Rb efflux from the islets. This inhibition was faster with 100 than with 20 microM phentolamine but its steady-state magnitude was similar with both concentrations. Yohimbine (20-100 microM) also inhibited the efflux rate but was not as potent as phentolamine. 3. In the presence of 6 mM glucose, most ATP-sensitive K+ channels are closed in the beta-cell membrane. Their opening by 100 microM diazoxide caused a marked acceleration of 86Rb efflux from the islets. This acceleration was almost entirely prevented by 20 microM phentolamine. It was barely affected by 20 microM yohimbine and reduced by 50% by 100 microM yohimbine. 4. ATP-sensitive K+ currents were studied in single beta-cells by the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Phentolamine (20-100 microM) caused a progressive but almost complete and irreversible inhibition of the current. The effects of yohimbine were faster but smaller; the inhibition was still incomplete with 100 microM yohimbine. 5. The increase in ATP-sensitive K+ current produced by 100 microM diazoxide was prevented by 100 microM phentolamine but only partially attenuated by 100 microM yohimbine. 6. It is concluded that phentolamine inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic beta-cells. This novel effect of phentolamine resembles that of hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas. It may account for previously unexplained effects of the drug. These observations also call for reinterpretation of many studies in which phentolamine was used as an allegedly specific blocker of alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "33": "To determine whether long-term reduction of intraocular pressure leads to a corresponding preservation of the pattern electroretinogram (PERG), PERGs were studied in 21 patients with ocular hypertension who had received unilateral timolol therapy for a minimum of 6 years. The mean difference in intraocular pressure (IOP) between the placebo-treated and the timolol-treated eyes (over 6 years) was 2.4 mm Hg. Steady-state PERGs (16.0 rps) were obtained simultaneously in both eyes of each patient, with four check sizes (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 degrees). Significant (p less than 0.05) steady-state PERG deficits (i.e., amplitude more than two standard deviations below the mean value of age-matched controls) were observed in 16 eyes of 12 patients (10 placebo-treated and 6 timolol-treated eyes). The mean PERG amplitude did not differ significantly between the placebo-treated and timolol-treated eyes. However, a significant correlation (r = -0.423) in the IOP differences between the placebo-treated and timolol-treated eyes and the corresponding PERG amplitude differences was noted in three of the four test conditions (i.e. 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 degrees). These results suggest that reducing IOP may preserve ganglion cell function in some patients with ocular hypertension.", 
    "34": "To assess the relative contribution of sympathetic and vagal influences on diurnal variation of sinus node recovery time (SNRT) in sick sinus syndrome (SSS), the diurnal changes of SNRT and the effects of propranolol and subsequent atropine on SNRT were examined in 39 patients with SSS. SNRT was measured before and after intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg), and after subsequent intravenous atropine (0.02 mg/kg) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. After completion of the electrophysiologic studies in the laboratory, SNRT was measured at 0 a.m. (midnight), 6 a.m. and 12 noon on the following day in the ward. After propranolol, SNRT was prolonged in 22 of 26 patients and shortened in 4 patients. After subsequent atropine, SNRT was prolonged in 5 of 26 patients and shortened in 21 patients. The patients with SNRT longer than 3 sec had a tendency to have greater diurnal variation of SNRT than those with SNRT less than 3 sec. A strong correlation (r = 0.98) was found between SNRT after propranolol and the longest SNRT in a 24-hour period. A difference of SNRT between after propranolol and after subsequent atropine was significantly correlated (r = 0.88) with a difference between the longest and the shortest SNRT in a 24-hour period. These results suggest that the diurnal changes in SNRT are regulated by the autonomic nervous system in SSS. SNRT after propranolol may be useful in estimating the longest SNRT in a day.", 
    "35": "Twenty-eight patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension well controlled by atenolol entered a five-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of sulindac and naproxen on blood pressure (BP) control. Atenolol alone was administered during weeks 1, 3, and 5. Naproxen or sulindac was administered with atenolol during week 2, with crossover during week 4. Data were analyzed for 27 of the patients (one dropped out after developing a skin rash). Naproxen significantly increased the systolic BP compared with placebo (mean 4.0 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1-7.0; p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in systolic BP during sulindac administration compared with placebo or naproxen. No significant effects on diastolic BP were observed. Weight was increased by naproxen and sulindac compared with placebo (mean 0.6-0.8 kg, p less than 0.05), although not to a clinically significant extent. One-week therapy with naproxen has a greater potential than sulindac to increase systolic BP in well-controlled hypertensive patients receiving atenolol; however, the increase is minor and unlikely to be of clinical significance.", 
    "36": "The efficacy and safety of long-acting propranolol (LA.P) 160 mg once-daily in the prophylactic treatment of migraine were tested against placebo in a multicentric, double-blind, randomized study comparing the two groups in a parallel manner over a treatment period of 12 weeks, and following a 4 week-placebo run-in period. Fifty-five out of the 74 patients who entered the trial included at the end of the run-in period. Forty-one patients completed the study. Out of the 14 patients who withdrew from the study, none discontinued because of side-effects. The statistical analysis was done according to the \"intention to treat\" principle. LA.P was significantly more efficient than placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (p = 0.01 by variance analysis). LA.P reduced the average number of monthly crises by 48% on day 84. There was a slight but significant reduction of the systolic blood pressure and heart rate in the erect position. There was no significant difference between LA.P and placebo regarding either the number of complaints or the number of side-effects elicited out of an 17 item questionnaire. None of the observed side effects led to a withdrawal of treatment.", 
    "37": "With the present increasing concern for compliance and quality or life during antihypertensive treatment, drug therapy tailored optimally for the individual patient is becoming increasingly important. The aim of the present double-blind crossover study was to analyse the individual as well as the group blood pressure response under enalapril and atenolol. Our results show that the group effects of these drugs did not differ significantly. However, individually, two-thirds of the responding patients showed a preference for either enalapril or atenolol. A response to one drug did not predict a comparable response to the other drug. We conclude that double-blind crossover studies are a possible way of individualizing antihypertensive treatment. However, no appropriate methodology or definitions of terms for these studies have yet been established.", 
    "38": "The antihypertensive effects of the beta-blocking agent betaxolol and the calcium entry blocker verapamil were compared in a crossover single-blind trial. Seventeen patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension took either betaxolol or a slow-release formulation of verapamil for two consecutive 6-week periods. The sequence of treatment phases was randomly allocated and a 2-week washout period preceded each treatment. The antihypertensive effect of the test drugs was assessed both at the physician's office and during everyday activities using a portable blood pressure recorder. The crossover design of the trial made it possible to evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy of betaxolol and verapamil both in the group as a whole and in the individual patient. The individual patient response to one of these agents was not a reliable indicator of the same patient's response to the alternative agent. Betaxolol brought both office and ambulatory recorded blood pressures under control in a larger fraction of patients than verapamil, although the magnitude of the blood pressure fall in the responders was equal for each drug. These observations stress the need for an individualized approach to the evaluation of antihypertensive therapy. The present results also demonstrate that optimal antihypertensive therapy is still a matter of trial and error. The precise methodology that ought to characterize crossover trials may make it possible to improve the therapeutic approach to hypertensive patients.", 
    "39": "In studying patients with mild hypertension, we used a double-blind, randomly allocated crossover, 2 x 2 factorial design to obtain more precise estimates of the effectiveness of individual hypertensive drugs and of the interactions when used in combination. In the present study, we reanalysed data from our own previously completed crossover factorial studies in order to determine the optimal length of phases and to try to exploit patient heterogeneity by comparing blood pressure responses within each patient to the two different drugs in each study. An analysis of the 'weeks within phases' variation (analysis of variance) applied to all phases, to the placebo phases alone and to the active treatment phases alone, of the individual factorial studies and of pooled data from studies of similar design, only revealed differences in the first week of our 4-week phases. Accordingly, we suggest that 4 weeks is an optimal phase length, since only the values from the third and fourth weeks showed the full expression of a drug's antihypertensive effect, avoiding the problem of a carryover effect and the need for a more complex intervening washout placebo phase. Comparing the blood pressure reductions shown by individual patients in response to different antihypertensive drugs using arbitrary criteria of greater than or equal to 5, 10 and 15 mmHg for diastolic and greater than or equal to 5, 10 and 20 mmHg for systolic pressure, we were unable to distinguish between the two separate drugs in each factorial study, due to the magnitude of the background variation which had a coefficient of variation of 5-7%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "MK-927 is a new topical carboanhydrase inhibitor with proven ability to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. Subjective and objective symptoms following topical application of MK-927 were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 24 healthy male volunteers took part. Symptoms were rated according to a visual analog scale by the volunteers and according to a grading scale by the examiner. The study showed good local tolerance of MK-927, comparable to that of Betaxolol.", 
    "41": "GABA-stimulating agents (muscimol, depakine, aminohydroxyacetic acid), serotonin stimulants (5-hydroxytryptophan, fluoxetine), catecholaminergic stimulants (L-DOPA, apomorphine) and a cholinergic inhibitor (hemicholinium-3) of the brain were found to enhance the inhibitory effect of morphine and pentapeptide FK 33-824 on the cortical excitability of free-moving cats. GABA-negative agents (thiosemicarbazide, bicuculline, picrotoxin), serotonin-negative agents (p-chlorophenylalanine, methysergide), catecholaminergic inhibitors (6-hydroxydopamine, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine) and cholinergic stimulant (physostigmine) of the brain appeared to decrease the effects of morphine and pentapeptide FK 33-824 on the excitability of the cortex. beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol decreased the effects of morphine and pentapeptide FK 33-824 on the cortical excitability, whereas alpha-adrenoblockers (phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and yochimbine) exerted no effect on their action.", 
    "42": "We studied the effects of angiotensin II (A-II) antagonist, propranolol and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) on arterial hypoxemia after injecting autologous muscle to induce massive pulmonary embolism. Twenty-four anesthetized paralyzed dogs were divided into four groups; control, intravenous A-II antagonist (1-sarcosine, 8-isoleucine A-II) infusion at 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, intravenous propranolol injection at 1.5-2.0 mg, and intravenous PGF2 alpha infusion at 1 microgram.kg-1.min-1. With FIO2 of 0.33, the administration of A-II antagonist produced an increase in arterial PO2 from 134 +/- 16 (mean +/- SE) to 155 +/- 11 mmHg during infusion, and to 160 +/- 9 mmHg 30 min after infusion. Simultaneous hemodynamic measurements demonstrated no significant changes in arterial blood pressure and heart rate, but a slight increase in cardiac output was observed. On the other hand, propranolol and PGF2 alpha did not reverse the pulmonary oxygenation. Cardiac output decreased after propranolol, and alveolar dead space and pulmonary artery pressure increased further after PGF2 alpha. We conclude that A-II antagonist may be effective in the treatment of massive pulmonary embolism, possibly by improving the ventilation-perfusion relationship. The exact mechanism of the effect of A-II antagonist has not been clarified.", 
    "43": "The effects of timolol on terbutaline- and VIP-stimulated aqueous humor flow were investigated in cynomolgus monkeys, with a labeled albumin dilution method. The maximal increase in aqueous humor flow caused by intracameral (100 micrograms/ml) or intravenous (0.4 micrograms/kg/min) administration of terbutaline was about 100%. The effect of intravenously infused terbutaline was completely abolished by intracameral administration of timolol, 0.1 mg/ml. The same dose of timolol also abolished the effect of intravenously infused VIP, 50 ng/kg/min. Intravenous administration of timolol, 0.2 mg/kg, had no effect on VIP-stimulated aqueous humor flow, when VIP (90 micrograms) was given intracamerally, but abolished completely the effect of intracameral terbutaline, 100 micrograms/ml. The results suggest that the effect of intravenously infused VIP on aqueous humor flow is secondary to activation of the sympathetic nervous system, while the effect of intracameral administration of VIP is a direct effect on the ciliary epithelium. The maximal aqueous humor flow achieved with terbutaline is comparable to that in conscious cynomolgus monkeys.", 
    "44": "A 22 year old woman presented with lupus nephritis, hypertension, and intractable nephrotic syndrome. Albumin and furosemide given intravenously was ineffective. Captopril administered in a daily dose of 62.5 mg was associated with a reduction in proteinuria from 28 g/24 hours to 11.5 g/24 hours over 10 weeks, resulting in a weight reduction of 16 kg. This was achieved with relative preservation of renal function. Captopril should be considered in the treatment of intractable proteinuria in patients with lupus nephritis, or when cytotoxic drugs are refused, because of its efficacy and relative safety. Captopril should, however, be used as an adjunct and not as a substitute for standard treatment.", 
    "45": "We created acute pancreatitis in cats by instilling ethanol (20 ml of a 40% solution) into the stomach and then perfusing activated pancreatic enzymes through the main pancreatic duct. Edematous pancreatitis developed within 24 h as the enzymes leaked out of the duct into the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. We tested the effects of a number of agents on the amelioration of the severity of the pancreatic inflammation. Cimetidine (an H2 receptor blocker) and Benadryl (an H1 receptor blocker) given in combination decreased the incidence of pancreatic hemorrhage but not the overall degree of inflammation. Indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) had a similar effect. Terbutaline (a beta-agonist) given alone decreased the overall degree of inflammation, including the incidence of hemorrhage. All of the drugs given together were no more effective than terbutaline alone. The combination was effective even when given up to 12 h after the onset of pancreatitis.", 
    "46": "The solubilization of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) liposomes by a weak electrolyte drug, propranolol (PPL) hydrochloride, has been studied as a function of pH, [PPL], [DMPC], and temperature. The solubilization of liposomes at 40 degrees C by 0.2 mM PPL occurred at different rates from 2.9 to 14.4 mM DMPC but converged at complete solubilization after 13 hr at pH 12.0. At the same [PPL], solubilization was complete after 18 days at pH 11.0, but incomplete solubilization occurred at pH 10.0 and not at all at lower pH's. In 14.4 mM DMPC liposomes, solubilization was gradual and proportional to the [PPL] from 0.001 to 0.10 mM up to 95 hr, then rapid thereafter. The [PPL] at which the solubilization efficiency began to increase rapidly was determined to be 0.078 mM. The rate of solubilization was also influenced by the fluidity of the bilayers, a sevenfold increase in the time for complete solubilization being observed upon cooling from 40 to 20 degrees C. Surface tension (st) data confirmed a low critical micelle concentration (CMC) and continued decrease in the st above the CMC. It is concluded that the critical ratio of PPL to DMPC for solubilization occurs in localized regions of the bilayers, with total solubilization at different rates depending on the [PPL] and the physical properties of the liposomes. The processes may be used advantageously to prepare small vesicles or to extract lipids or proteins, more efficiently than detergents, from biological membranes.", 
    "47": "The pharmacokinetics of nadolol have been previously reported to be linear between single and steady-state dosing. Data from a study in our laboratory suggested greater than expected beta-blockade with nadolol at steady state. Because the early potency studies were single-dose studies, we hypothesized there was a nonlinearity in nadolol pharmacokinetics which produced higher than expected plasma concentrations at steady state. Six normal volunteers from the previous study (steady state) volunteered to participate in the single-dose study. Plasma concentrations were determined for 24 hr following a single dose of nadolol, 80 mg. A simple, inexpensive, and accurate method for determination of nadolol in plasma or serum by HPLC with fluorometric detection is described. The AUC0-tau at steady state was greater than the AUC0-infinity following a single dose in five of the six subjects. The mean ratio of AUCss/AUCsd was 2.54. This value would be unity in the presence of linear pharmacokinetics. We conclude that the principle of superposition is not applicable for nadolol.", 
    "48": "We report a case of hyperthyroidism due to inappropriate thyrotrophin (TSH) secretion in a patient with selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone action. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism in patients with this disorder are usually mild, implying some peripheral tissue resistance to the metabolic effects of thyroid hormone. Our patient had unusually severe symptoms, including marked weight loss and cardiac arrythmias which required carbimazole and beta-blocker therapy for control. Somatostatin was ineffective in suppressing TSH secretion. The introduction of sensitive thyrotrophin assays should facilitate the accurate diagnosis of TSH-induced hyperthyroidism and avoid inappropriate treatment.", 
    "49": "In a patient with frequent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, an electrophysiologic study was performed. Although by programmed atrial stimulation only double AV nodal pathways could be documented, three distinct forms of AV nodal reentrant tachycardia could be induced. By programmed atrial stimulation a typical AV nodal reentrant tachycardia was initiated, by programmed ventricular stimulation, an AV nodal reentrant tachycardia was induced with an antegrade conduction time of 215 ms and a retrograde conduction time of 160 ms. Furthermore, a third form of tachycardia was induced with alternating cycle length due to two different antegrade conduction times, whereas retrograde conduction time was almost identical, irrespective of the antegrade conduction time. The patient received betaxolol (20 mg day-1); during a second electrophysiologic study, the tachycardia could not be induced, and it did not occur spontaneously during a follow-up period of 14 months.", 
    "50": "The anti-hypertensive effects of atenolol (Tenormin) 50 mg, a potassium-sparing diuretic (half-strength Moduretic) comprising hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg plus 2.5 mg amiloride hydrochloride, and the 'free' combination of atenolol and diuretic were compared in elderly hypertensive patients aged 60-79 years. After a four-week run-in period on placebo, patients were randomly assigned, in a double-blind manner, to atenolol or diuretic treatment, each for four weeks. Thereafter patients were given the 'free' combination for a further four weeks and this treatment was continued for six months. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured after the patient had rested for five minutes supine and after two minutes standing. These blood pressure measurements were made at least 24 hours after the preceding dose using a Random Zero sphygmomanometer. Results from 26 of the 27 patients entered into the study showed an advantage for combination therapy combined with either atenolol or diuretic treatment alone. No significant difference was found between treatments in the frequency of supraventricular and ventricular ectopic beats occurring in six patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. However, ectopic activity was reduced in some patients during beta-blocker treatment. Few adverse effects occurred with any treatment. Three patients withdrew during the placebo period and three withdrew while taking active treatment. This study has shown that the combination of atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride hydrochloride is an effective, safe, well-tolerated antihypertensive drug regimen when used once daily in elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "51": "1. Although, long half-life compounds appear to be more appropriate pharmacological indicators of compliance with treatment, short half-life markers or measurements of short half-life therapeutic drugs are frequently used. 2. We have compared the usefulness of low-dose phenobarbitone (a long half-life indicator), low dose isoniazid (a short half-life marker) and controlled release metoprolol (Metros) (a controlled release formulation of a short half-life 'therapeutic' drug) in seven volunteers with simulated partial (two thirds) compliance. 3. Detection of isoniazid metabolites in urine had an 83% sensitivity and 94% specificity for detecting ingestion within the previous 24 h and 100% sensitivity and 82% specificity for detecting ingestion within the past 6 h but gave no indication of the longer term pattern of compliance. 4. At 28 days (a time when steady-state would be obtained for all three drugs) phenobarbitone plasma levels were 70% (66-76%)--median and interquartile range--of the expected steady-state level if compliance had been complete. Corresponding figures for metoprolol were 82% (37-100%). 5. Measurement of phenobarbitone was much superior to isoniazid or metoprolol measurements in reflecting partial compliance over the previous 1 to 4 weeks.", 
    "52": "Increasing the ocular absorption of timolol relative to its systemic absorption is important clinically because ophthalmic timolol may cause serious respiratory, cardiac, and central nervous system side effects. The authors evaluated the effects of phenylephrine coadministration and solution viscosity on the aqueous humor:plasma and iris ciliary body:plasma ratios of peak timolol concentrations after ocular application. Timolol eye drops (5 mg/ml, 25 microliters) were administered to the eyes of pigmented rabbits. Coadministered phenylephrine (0.8-8.2 mg/ml) decreased the systemic peak concentrations of timolol significantly. Since ocular absorption of timolol was not affected by phenylephrine, the ocular:systemic concentration ratios were improved four- to fivefold. Phenylephrine slows down the systemic absorption of timolol by constricting the conjunctival and nasal capillaries. The ratios of the aqueous humor:plasma and iris ciliary body:plasma peak concentration of timolol were improved three- to ninefold in the presence of sodium carboxymethylcellulose compared with nonviscous eye drops. The improved ocular penetration is probably due to the longer corneal contact, and the decreased rate of systemic absorption may be caused by the slower spreading of the solution on the nasal mucosa. Compared with timolol eye drops, the ratio of the eye:plasma peak timolol concentrations was improved tenfold by using viscous eye drops with phenylephrine. Systemic concentrations of ophthalmic timolol and possibly related side effects can be decreased when timolol is instilled in a viscous vehicle with a low phenylephrine concentration.", 
    "53": "A case with syncope on exertion and paced heart block is presented. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was seen on Holter monitoring and reproduced repeatedly by either exercise or an injection of an alpha agonist, but not with provocative electrophysiology. Antihypertensive treatment using a beta-blocker with endogenous sympathomimetic activity prevented recurrences. It is suggested that this is a case of pressure-related tachycardia.", 
    "54": "Myocardial salvage can be maximized by the early institution of thrombolytic therapy and aspirin. Certain patients may benefit from the administration of intravenous heparin, beta blockers, or nitroglycerin. The routine use of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or calcium-channel blockers does not appear to be warranted. Recurrent myocardial ischemia should be vigorously treated with medical therapy and there may be value in cardiac catheterization, followed by PTCA or bypass surgery, depending upon the extent of myocardium at risk and the underlying coronary anatomy. Long-term morbidity and mortality may be reduced by instituting aspirin and beta blockers as well as by modifying risk factors. There is no evidence for the long-term benefit from any calcium-channel blocker. Oral anticoagulation may be warranted in those patients with a mural thrombus, congestive heart failure, or atrial fibrillation. ACE inhibitors may be of value in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction and certainly in the presence of symptomatic congestive heart failure. Antiarrhythmic therapy is generally indicated only for symptomatic or life-threatening arrhythmias. Residual myocardial ischemia should be sought by exercise testing, and those patients with poor exercise tolerance generally warrant cardiac catheterization in consideration for revascularization.", 
    "55": "The K+ current iKl sets the resting potential in cardiac cells. Here we report that isoproterenol (ISO), a prototypical beta agonist, increases inactivation of iKl. This action of ISO on iKl is mimicked by permeant analogues of cAMP but is not blocked by the beta blockers propranolol and pindolol or the alpha blockers prazosin or yohimbine. We suggest that this novel action of ISO may contribute to pacemaker activity in the Purkinje strand and be mediated through a class of receptors different from classical beta's or alpha's.", 
    "56": "A double-blind multicentre study of 349 hypertensive patients was performed to compare the side-effects of the two beta-blockers atenolol (selective beta 1-blocker) and pindolol (beta 1- and beta 2-blocker with Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA] in equipotential doses (100 mg atenolol vs. 15 mg pindolol). Male and female patients aged 20-65 years with essential hypertension WHO stages I and II were included. Patients were examined 1 and 6 months after the start of treatment, and side-effects were recorded. The antihypertensive effect was similar for the two drugs. After 1 month there was significantly less bradycardia (P less than 0.01), cold hands and feet (P less than 0.05) and tiredness (P less than 0.02) in the pindolol group, and less sleep disturbance (P less than 0.02) in the atenolol group. After 6 months there was no significant difference in sleep disturbance, but the differences in the other side-effects remained significant.", 
    "57": "We have studied the effects of propranolol on the number and function of beta-adrenoceptors of cultured heart cells from mice. After 24 hrs in culture, heart cells were incubated for 48 hrs with either standard medium or medium containing propranolol. After a washing period of 30 min, beta-adrenoceptors were measured with a receptor binding assay. The dissociation constant (Kd) did not differ between control and cultured heart cells pretreated with propranolol. By contrast, the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) was 2.5 times higher in propranolol-pretreated than control cultured heart cells. The increase in the rate of beating and the elevation of cyclic AMP content induced by 10(-5) M isoproterenol were significantly higher for cultured cells pretreated with propranolol than for control cells. These results indicate a correlation between an increased number of beta-adrenoceptors and increased physiological responses of cultured heart cells after propranolol withdrawal.", 
    "58": "Changes in beta-adrenergic regulation of the cardiovascular system in aging involved 40 healthy subjects aged 20-34, 60-74 and 75-89 have been studied. Single drug loads with propranolol (0.6 mg/kg, per os) and isadrin (10 mg, sublingually) were used. With aging, the beta-adrenergic regulation of heart at various levels (in the central and autonomic vegetative nervous system, the ACTH-cortisol system) changes. The negative effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on the cardiovascular system enhances, that is a result of a more significant suppression of the sympathetic effects on the heart and peculiarities of the propranolol pharmacokinetics in old age. The reactivity of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in response to their stimulation decreases as well. Blockade of the beta-adrenoreceptors produces a distinct saving effect on the performance of the cardio-respiratory system under conditions of physical loading, that is due to a suppression of sympathetic hyperactivity and elimination of excess strain in the ACTH-cortisol system at the peak submaximal physical loading.", 
    "59": "Acute lethal blood loss followed by resuscitation was found to decrease noradrenaline and increase epinephrine levels in heart muscle in experiments on mongrel male rats which significantly increase heart beta-adreno-receptors sensitivity to exogenous noradrenaline. Preliminary inderal injection prevents excessive heart beta-adreno-receptors stimulation by catecholamines, considerably reduces post-resuscitation rhythmic disturbances and prevents ventricular fibrillation which significantly decreases early post-resuscitation lethality.", 
    "60": "The effect of isoproterenol on the uptake of [14C]glucose into cultured glial cells was investigated in the present study. Isoproterenol markedly stimulated the uptake of [14C]glucose 30 min after incubation. This action was produced in a dose-dependent manner. A positive correlation between the increase of [14C]glucose uptake and the stimulation of adenylate cyclase induced by isoproterenol was obtained (r = 0.99). The effect of isoproterenol was reduced by the beta-adrenergic blockers but not by other blockers, indicating the selective action of isoproterenol. The results obtained suggest that isoproterenol stimulates the uptake of glucose into glial cells through the activation of beta-adrenoceptors which are linked to adenylate cyclase.", 
    "61": "The efficacy of captopril at 75 mg/day, atenolol at 100 mg/day and canrenoate potassium at 200 mg/day was compared in 42 essential hypertensive patients in randomly assigned sequences. All the drugs lowered blood pressure significantly but variations were found in the individual response. Patients who were more responsive to captopril also seemed to be more responsive to atenolol and vice versa (r = 0.75; P less than 0.0001), while the relationship between mean blood pressure reached after canrenoate potassium and that reached after atenolol or captopril was much weaker. The patients who were responsive to atenolol and captopril were considered as one group (n = 22) and compared with the 12 patients more responsive to canrenoate potassium. Before treatment, the former group had higher plasma renin activity (PRA) and lower Na,K cotransport activity across the erythrocyte membrane than the latter. These two variables, considered together as a discriminant function, correctly classified 92% of cases in the canrenoate potassium responder group and 73% of cases in the atenolol-captopril responders. These results raise the problem of individual assessment to obtain the most effective antihypertensive therapy and suggest that PRA and Na,K cotransport may be useful in predicting the individual response to antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "62": "Because of ostensible effects of fetal exposure to ethanol on cardiac and memory functions, beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor binding were surveyed in hippocampus and heart in 8- and 17-day-old rat pups. Pregnant, multiparous rats were intubated with either 6 g/kg ethanol or isocaloric dextrose twice daily from gestational days 10-16. At birth, offspring were fostered to untreated mothers. Pups exposed to ethanol had diminished birth weights, although there was no difference in the amount of weight gain by ethanol and control dams during gestation, nor in litter size. Ethanol pups remained smaller than control pups, but this difference was significant only until 8 days of age. At 17 days of age, ethanol pups had fewer hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors than age-matched controls; muscarinic receptors and CA1 cell densities were not disparate. Parallel studies suggested that approximately 50% of the hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors in 8-day-olds were of the beta 1 and beta 2 subtypes, while by 17 days of age approximately 70% of the receptors were beta 1. There was an ontogenetic increment in both beta-adrenergic and muscarinic binding from 8 to 17 days of age in hippocampus. No differences between age or drug groups were found in the binding measures in heart tissue. The present findings indicate that fetal ethanol treatment affects developmental measures and beta-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampus in a quasi-selective manner, but not hippocampal CA1-cell density.", 
    "63": "1. Type 1 astrocytes prepared from 3-day rat cortex and cerebellum express the 1.3-kb nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA and synthesize and release beta-NGF. 2. Isoproterenol (IP), a beta-adrenergic agonist, stimulates NGF mRNA content in cortical astrocytes; this increase is blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not the alpha-antagonist phenoxybenzamine. The EC50 for the effect of IP is 5 nM. 3. IP increases astrocyte cyclic AMP as does forskolin, which directly activates adenylate cyclase and also increases NGF mRNA content. Cerebellar astrocytes contain about one-third as much NGF mRNA, which can also be increased by forskolin and cyclic AMP. 4. These results suggest that CNS astrocytes can serve as a source of NGF and that the NGF gene is one of the class of cyclic AMP regulated genes.", 
    "64": "1. Using [3H]DHA and unlabeled L-alprenolol, a substantial amount of over 64% specific binding of beta-adrenergic receptor has been identified on the neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cell, which has been proven to display numerous functional characteristics of intact neurons. 2. Beta-adrenergic receptor binding on intact NG108-15 cells does not change significantly upon morphological differentiation, induced by 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dBcAMP). 3. The [3H]DHA binding on intact NG108-15 cells is rapid, saturable, and reversible, having a t1/2 of 1.0 min for association and 3.5 min for dissociation. 4. The affinity constant (Kd) and maximum binding capacity (Bmax) for binding of [3H]DHA to beta-adrenergic receptors on NG108-15 cells have been estimated by Scatchard plot analysis to be 2.5 and 0.23 nM, respectively. Further analysis indicates a single class of receptors for [3HDHA binding on NG108-15 cells. 5. Studies on kinetic properties have revealed on-rate (K + 1) and off-rate (K - 1) constants of 0.7 X 10(-9) M min-1 and 0.19 min-1, respectively. Further, the IC50 value and inhibition constant (Ki) for unlabeled L-alprenolol to inhibit [3HDHA binding on NG108-15 cells have been estimated to be 10(-5) and 8.9 X 10(-6) M, respectively. 6. The rank-order potency of catecholamine agonists, (-)ISO greater than (+)ISO greater than EPI greater than NE, reveals the presence of type 2 receptor for the beta-adrenergic binding on both differentiated and undifferentiated NG108-15 cells. 7. The present study indicates that the clonal neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG108-15 cell line possesses substantial amounts of beta-adrenergic receptors with characteristics similar to those on neuronal cells.", 
    "65": "Vascular endothelium produces prostacyclin (PG12) and endothelium-derived vascular relaxing factor (EDRF), which are potent vasodilators and hence, may have a role in the regulation of blood pressure. Both PG12 and EDRF are readily degraded by free radicals, especially superoxide anion. Hence, we studied free radical generation and lipid peroxidation in patients with uncontrolled essential hypertension. It was observed that superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and the levels of lipid peroxides (measured by thiobarbituric acid assay) were higher in uncontrolled hypertensives compared to controls. Both free radical generation and the levels of lipid peroxides reverted to normal values when assayed after the control of hypertension. The calcium antagonist, verapamil, and beta-1 blocker, metoprolol, at the doses used inhibited free radical generation by phorbolmyristate acetate-stimulated PMNs. On the other hand, angiotensin II augmented free radical generation in normal PMN. In addition, it was also observed that both linoleic acid and arachidonic acid levels are low in the plasma of patients with hypertension compared to controls. These results suggest that increase in free radical generation by PMN and alterations in the plasma concentrations of essential fatty acids are closely associated with uncontrolled hypertension.", 
    "66": "We studied beta-adrenergic receptors and responses in human fetal lung (15-25 wk gestation) maintained in explant culture with and without added dexamethasone. To determine beta-adrenergic receptor concentration, we performed radioligand binding assays with [125I]-iodocyanopindolol. We also examined the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cAMP generation as a measure of response to beta-adrenergic receptor occupancy. In control cultures, beta-receptor concentration increased significantly from d 0 to 3 of culture and thereafter remained stable. The kd (approximately 24 pM) of [125I]-iodocyanopindolol did not change with time in culture. The ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cAMP generation over basal levels increased in controls throughout the 5 d in explant culture. Addition of dexamethasone (10 nM) to the culture medium partially blocked the increase in beta-receptor concentration and decreased both cAMP content and generation (basal and stimulated) in a dose-dependent manner (median effective concentration approximately 1 nM). In these same explants, dexamethasone increased the activity of fatty acid synthetase, an enzyme important in surfactant synthesis, more than 2-fold. Our results indicate that beta-adrenergic receptors and isoproterenol stimulation of cAMP generation increase spontaneously in human fetal lung grown in explant culture. Dexamethasone, which accelerates other aspects of human lung development in vitro, decreases beta-adrenergic receptor concentration and inhibits beta-adrenergic responses.", 
    "67": "The rat portal vein has spontaneous mechanical activity. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists and verapamil alone and together on this mechanical activity have been determined. Isoprenaline, but not dobutamine, attenuated the contractile activity. Three successive challenges to isoprenaline produced identical attenuation curves. The responses to isoprenaline were antagonized by propranolol, metoprolol, and ICI 118,551, and the pA2 values, derived by Schild analysis, were 9.12, 6.78, and 9.33, respectively. Thus, the rat portal vein contains predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors. Verapamil attenuated the contractile activity of the rat portal vein, and this attenuation was not altered by the presence of propranolol at 10(-5) M. The potencies of isoprenaline and propranolol were not altered by the presence of a 30% attenuation of the contractile activity with verapamil at 10(-7) M. Thus, the rat portal vein may be used to determine the potencies of drugs as beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists and as voltage dependent calcium channel blockers. In addition, the potency of drugs as beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on the rat portal vein may be determined in the presence of some voltage dependent calcium channel blockade.", 
    "68": "The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was employed to study the beta-adrenergic modulation of voltage-gated K+ currents in CD8+ human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The beta-receptor agonist, isoproterenol, decreased the peak current amplitude and increased the rate of inactivation of the delayed rectifier K+ current. In addition, isoproterenol decreased the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation and shifted the steady-state inactivation curve to the left. Isoproterenol, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the steady-state parameters of current activation. The isoproterenol-induced decrease in peak current amplitude was inhibited by the beta-blocker propranolol. Bath application of dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM) mimicked the effects of isoproterenol on both K+ current amplitude and time course of inactivation. Furthermore, the reduction in the peak current amplitude in response to isoproterenol was attenuated when PKI5-24 (2-5 microM), a synthetic peptide inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, was present in the pipette solution. The increase in the rate of inactivation of the K+ currents in response to isoproterenol was mimicked by the internal application of GTP-gamma-S (300 microM) and by exposure of the cell to cholera toxin (1 microgram/ml), suggesting the involvement of a G protein. These results demonstrate that the voltage-dependent K+ conductance in T lymphocytes can be modulated by beta-adrenergic stimulation. The effects of beta-agonists, i.e., isoproterenol, appear to be receptor mediated and could involve cAMP-dependent protein kinase as well as G proteins. Since inhibition of the delayed rectifier K+ current has been found to decrease the proliferative response in T lymphocytes, the beta-adrenergic modulation of K+ current may well serve as a feedback control mechanism limiting the extent of cellular proliferation.", 
    "69": "1. The effects of cholinergic agonists on voltage-dependent calcium current (ICa) were studied in cultured chromaffin cells from bovine adrenal medulla. 2. Application of both acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine resulted in inward nicotinic current from a holding potential of -90 mV, and at the same time reversible decreases in depolarization-activated ICa. Both of these effects were blocked by d-tubocurarine, while atropine pre-treatment was ineffective. 3. Internal accumulation of neither Na+ nor Ca2+ seems likely to explain the nicotinic-agonist-dependent decrease in ICa, as the modulation was observed with symmetrical Na+ solutions, with Ca2(+)-free Ba2(+)-containing external solutions, from holding potentials of both -90 and -40 mV, and when the internal Ca2+ buffer capacity was increased. 4. Isodihydrohistrionicotoxin, an open-channel blocker which does not compete for the agonist binding site, completely inhibited inward cholinergic currents while the agonist-dependent decrease in ICa was seen in only two of fifteen cells. 5. The nicotinic agonist-mediated decreases in ICa were not voltage-dependent. 6. No changes in voltage-dependent INa were seen with the nicotinic agonists. 7. Muscarine, with or without GTP in the pipette solution, produced neither modulation of ICa nor any changes in steady holding currents. The nicotinic current and the reversible decrease in ICa induced by ACh and nicotine were not affected by including GTP, or the guanine nucleotide analogues GDP-beta-S and GTP-gamma-S, in the pipette solution. 8. A 10 min pre-incubation of the cells in a high-K+ solution optimal for catecholamine secretion did not affect the nicotinic agonist-mediated decreases in ICa.", 
    "70": "To gain a better understanding of the regulation of cutaneous blood flow in the bullfrog, the vascular innervation, vasoactivity and adrenoceptor types of the cutaneous vasculature were investigated using a pump-perfused skin preparation. Stimulation of cranial nerve I, the vagal ganglion, sympathetic ganglion 1 and sometimes sympathetic ganglion 2 caused cutaneous vascular resistance (CVR) to increase. Stimulation of cranial nerve IX and spinal nerves 1 and 2 had no effect on CVR. The response to stimulation of sympathetic ganglion 1 was antagonized by phentolamine but not by atropine. Phentolamine, atropine and alpha,beta-methylene ATP had no effect on the response to vagal stimulation. Both epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE) increased CVR, with EPI being more potent than NE. The minimum concentrations of EPI and NE required for a significant change in CVR were much higher than plasma catecholamine levels reported for resting bullfrogs. Phentolamine antagonized, but propranolol had no effect on, the responses to the catecholamines. Isoproterenol caused small decreases in CVR which were abolished by propranolol. Acetylcholine was a weak vasodilator. The results indicate that the cutaneous vasculature has two types of vasomotor nerves: sympathetic nerves that are probably adrenergic, and other nerves that are non-adrenergic/non-cholinergic and which do not use ATP as a transmitter. Although catecholamines are vasoactive, the sensitivity of the cutaneous vasculature to EPI and NE is probably too low to allow a direct regulatory role of these hormones on CVR. There is no evidence for cholinergic regulation of CVR. Both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors are present in the cutaneous vasculature. alpha-Adrenoceptors mediate the constrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and catecholamine administration. It is unlikely that beta-adrenoceptors play a significant role in regulating CVR.", 
    "71": "In this study we examined the role of alpha and beta blockade on glucose and lactate metabolism during the acute stress of insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Three groups of conscious dogs with chronically fitted catheters in the femoral artery and in the femoral, portal, and hepatic veins were studied after an 18-hr fast. After a 1-hr basal period, hypoglycemia was induced with insulin infusion at 5 mU/kg.min for 3 hr. Group 1 received no other treatment. Groups 2 and 3 received, respectively, phentolamine (8 micrograms/kg.min) and propranolol (4 micrograms/kg.min) beginning 30 minutes before and throughout the experimental period. Despite similar hyperinsulinemia, plasma glucose dropped in Group 1 (from 115 +/- 10 to 40 +/- 3 mg/dl) and in Group 2 (from 110 +/- 4 to 60 +/- 3 mg/dl) but in Group 3 it was maintained at 45 +/- 4 mg/dl by exogenous glucose infusion at a rate of 2.2 +/- 0.4 mg/kg.min. Hepatic glucose production increased 50 +/- 13%, 127 +/- 30%, and 55 +/- 30% in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively, within 60 minutes and was 56 +/- 19%, 55 +/- 17%, and -0.04 +/- 12% during the last hour of the experiment. Glucose utilization did not change in Groups 1 and 2 but it increased in Group 3. Plasma lactate increased in Group 1 (from 850 +/- 190 to 1,980 +/- 450 mumol/L) and in Group 2 (985 +/- 180 to 4,785 +/- 500 mumol/L), while in Group 3 there was an early rise (to 695 +/- 120 mumol/L) within 30 minutes that gradually dropped to near basal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "Cultured fetal human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) was grown on a permeable substrate and sealed in an Ussing chamber. The average electrical resistance (R) was 330 ohm-cm2, the average transepithelial voltage (Ve) was 3.0 mV (apical side positive), and the average short circuit current (Isc) was 9.1 microA/cm2. When these RPE preparations were exposed to isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic agonist), the Isc increased by 88%, R was reduced by 6%, and Ve increased by 85%. The effect of isoproterenol was blocked by propranolol (a beta-adrenergic antagonist). When cultured human RPE was exposed to isoproterenol, intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels rose more than threefold. The effect of isoproterenol on cyclic AMP levels was blocked by propranolol. When the cultured RPE was exposed to dibutyryl cyclic AMP, both Ve and Isc rose by 47% with a time course similar to that which occurred when the cells were exposed to isoproterenol. Preparations treated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not respond to subsequently applied isoproterenol. These results indicate that cultured human RPE possesses a beta-adrenergic receptor and that stimulation of this receptor produces a change in cyclic AMP concentration which affects RPE electrical activity.", 
    "73": "The determination of receptor-ligand dissociation constants from displacement data has been restricted until recently to the condition of receptor saturation, in which the concentration of receptor is negligible as compared to the displaced ligand and the displacing ligand used. This restriction has lately been removed since an accurate method has been developed for the determination of the dissociation constants for all experimental conditions for a system that includes a single type of binding site. In many cases, however, there are two types of receptor binding sites that exhibit different affinities toward the ligand. The present study provides an analytic solution for the problem of determination of the two dissociation constants as well as the proportion of the two receptor types. The formal derivation of the equations is described, along with analysis of a displacement simulation. The sensitivity of the method to the ratio between the two dissociation constants is also investigated. The application of the method is demonstrated for the analysis of the binding of beta-adrenergic receptors to the agonist isoproterenol as monitored by the displacement of the beta-antagonist 125I-labeled cyanopindolol.", 
    "74": "A novel in situ screening procedure was used to identify neutral mutations in the human beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR). The coding region of the human beta 2AR gene was subcloned under transcriptional control of an inducible T7 promoter and used to transform Escherichia coli. Colonies expressing the beta 2AR bound the radiolabeled antagonist [125I]iodocyanopindolol and could be identified by autoradiography after transfer to nitrocellulose filters. The region of the beta 2AR between residues 76 and 83, in the second transmembrane helix, was mutagenized by a saturation mutagenesis technique, so that virtually all of the beta 2AR genes contained at least one mutation. Colonies retaining ligand binding activity were isolated using the in situ screen. Sequence analysis of the active mutant receptor genes allowed the identification of individual amino acid side chains which are essential for either ligand binding or structural integrity of the beta 2AR receptor.", 
    "75": "Herein we show, for the first time, a very marked increase in thyroxine 5'-deiodinase (5'-D) activity in rats injected with norepinephrine (NE) and desmethylimipramine, a drug which inhibits NE uptake by nerve terminals. The response to NE was greater in pineals collected from hypothyroid animals than in glands from euthyroid animals. NE was more effective in stimulating pineal 5'-D than was isoproterenol, suggesting that, in addition to beta-adrenergic receptors, alpha-adrenergic receptors might be involved in the 5'-D activation. However, phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, did not potentiate the effect of isoproterenol on pineal 5'-D activity. The nocturnal increase in pineal 5'-D activity was completely abolished by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, while prazosin, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker, had minimal effect. These results show that the role of alpha-receptors in promoting the NE-mediated rise in rat pineal 5'-D activity is minor in contrast to the role of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "76": "1. The provocative dose of inhaled propranolol, (PC20P, mg/mL) needed to induce a 20% reduction in the forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1, L) was determined for 15 adult asthmatics following randomized pre-treatment with placebo, ipratropium bromide (40, 160 micrograms) and fenoterol (200, 800 micrograms) aerosols using a double-blind protocol. 2. Fenoterol 200 micrograms, 800 micrograms increased the baseline FEV1 0.28 +/- 0.16, 0.32 +/- 0.16 L (P = 0.04, P = 0.008 respectively). Fenoterol 800 micrograms moved the PC20 P rightwards from placebo geometric mean 10.95, 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) 4.43-27.22 mg/mL to mean 20.41, 95% CI 10.13 to 40.64 mg/mL (P = 0.01). Fenoterol 200 micrograms was not protective; mean PC20 16.22, 95% CI 7.83-34.35 mg/mL (P = 0.08). Neither 40 or 160 micrograms ipratropium changed the FEV1 or PC20P values compared with placebo; increase in FEV1 0.15 +/- 0.27 L (P = 0.22), 0.24 +/- 0.12 L (P = 0.14) and geometric mean PC20P 16.59 +/- 0.57 mg/mL, 95% CI 8.01-34.51 mg/mL (P = 0.90), 15.58 +/- 0.66 mg/mL, 95% CI 6.72-36.05 mg/mL (P = 0.34) respectively after ipratropium treatments. 3. Bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled propranolol (P) appears to be only weakly antagonized by inhaled beta-agonist and not reduced by antimuscarinic anticholinergic aerosol. This finding argues against the activation of a cholinergic reflex to explain propranolol induced bronchoconstriction (PIB).", 
    "77": "The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of sufentanil 1 micrograms.kg-1 during N2O-O2 and intermittent isoflurane anaesthesia in major non-cardiac surgery. Thirty-one patients (18 females, 13 males; mean age 47 yr), undergoing cholecystectomy received a 1 microgram.kg-1 bolus of sufentanil before the induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone. On average, three sufentanil increments were administered, to a total (bolus + maintenance) dose of 1.5 micrograms.kg-1. Cardiovascular stability was not achieved in eleven patients who then were given isoflurane. The arterial pressure decreased after sufentanil (P less than 0.05), reaching a nadir (mean 108/65 mmHg, heart rate 63 bpm) at one minute post-incision. Clinically important hypertension or hypotension did not occur in any patient. One patient, receiving beta-blocker therapy, required atropine to control bradycardia. Postoperative respiratory depression did not occur in patients who received less than one micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 with the last increment being given more than 20 minutes before the end of anaesthesia. Slight respiratory depression in the recovery room was reported in one patient, who had received a total of 1.3 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 of sufentanil, and the last sufentanil increment 24 min before the end of surgery. The most frequently reported side-effects were nausea (35 per cent) and vomiting (23 per cent). Induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia were rated as \"good\" in 87, 87, and 74 per cent of the cases, respectively, and \"satisfactory\" in the remainder. We conclude that this technique is valuable to assure good protection of the cardiovascular system without undue respiratory depression during recovery.", 
    "78": "Hypoxia causes the release of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), but the mechanisms are not yet understood. This study examined the relative contribution of pulmonary arterial hypertension, neural pathways, increased heart rate, or increased atrial size to the ANF response. Alveolar hypoxia [fractional concentration of O2 in inspired gas (FIo2) = 0.1] or pulmonary arterial hypertension (25-45 mmHg) was induced for 10 min in four series (n = 4-12 each) of anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs. During hypoxia, plasma ANF concentrations increased by 129 +/- 52 (SE) pg/ml (or 271 +/- 105%) over baseline (35 +/- 7 pg/ml; P less than 0.01) (series 1). There was also a significant increase of pulmonary arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Repeated pulmonary hypertension induced by intravenous air infusion caused a repeated and reversible 125 +/- 14% increase (P less than 0.001) of plasma ANF, and this response was totally abolished by lesion of the cervical vagosympathetic trunks (series 2). Lesion of these nerves 1 h before hypoxia also decreased the ANF response to hypoxia by 45-58% (P less than 0.01), whereas responses of heart rate and atrial pressures were unchanged (series 3). The ANF response to hypoxia, expressed in percent of baseline, was not affected by 0.2 mg/kg propranolol (PR) (no PR: 145 +/- 63%; PR: 151 +/- 82%; not significantly different from series 1 and control, series 3), although the increase in heart rate (no PR: 61 +/- 15 beats/min) was almost abolished (PR: 17 +/- 5 beats/min) (series 4). Hypoxia caused no significant changes in right and left atrial peak volume regardless of propranolol, as measured with an electrical conductance catheter. The results indicate that a new neural reflex of probably pulmonary arterial origin mediates approximately 50% of the ANF response to hypoxia. The remaining ANF response remains to be explored further and cannot be explained by conventional release mechanisms such as atrial stretch and pulsatility alone.", 
    "79": "Cardiac function is based on the complex biochemistry of cardiac muscle contraction. Contributing factors are action potential, membrane receptors, ion channels and G proteins, the important effectors in the sarcoplasm, particularly calcium ion and protein kinase, and the interaction of the contractile proteins. These are various pharmacological approaches to cardiovascular function by modulating the myocardial biochemistry. These include beta agonists, beta antagonists, mixed adrenergic agonists, nonadrenergic inotropes (including PDE III inhibitors), and nonadrenergic vasodilators.", 
    "80": "Serum and mononuclear cell magnesium content were determined in a cross-sectional study performed in four groups of hypertensive patients on chronic treatment with atenolol (n = 11), enalapril (n = 10), thiazide diuretics (n = 12), or enalapril + thiazides (n = 11). Our study shows that in patients treated with the thiazides alone, in spite of normal serum potassium and magnesium levels, mononuclear cell magnesium was decreased. To the extent that mononuclear Mg content mirrors the body ion stores, our results indicate that thiazides induce a Mg depletion not detectable by monitoring serum levels.", 
    "81": "To understand the cardiovascular response to respiratory acidosis, we measured hemodynamics, left ventricular pressure, and left ventricular volume (three ultrasonic crystal pairs) during eucapnia and respiratory acidosis in 10 fentanyl-anesthetized open-chest dogs. Left ventricular contractility was assessed primarily by measuring the slope (Emax) and intercept (V0) of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relation determined by combining end-systolic points from a vena caval occlusion and from brief aortic cross-clamping. Respiratory acidosis (pH 7.09, Pco2 92 mm Hg) reduced contractility by a decrease in Emax (11.4 to 9.2 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.01) with no change in V0. Despite this, cardiac output increased (1.7 to 2.1 l/min, p less than 0.01), and heart rate increased (96 to 121 beats/min, p less than 0.05), with no change in blood pressure. Systemic vascular resistance fell by 26% (p less than 0.01). During eucapnia, propranolol reduced Emax (11.4 to 4.6 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.01) with no change in V0. After propranolol treatment, respiratory acidosis further reduced Emax (4.6 to 3.6 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.05) and increased end-systolic volume more than before propranolol (p less than 0.001). Now cardiac output did not increase even though heart rate increased (81 to 106 beats/min, p less than 0.001) and systemic vascular resistance fell by 20% (p less than 0.01). We conclude that the effect of respiratory acidosis on the circulation is to increase venous return (equals cardiac output) in the face of decreased left ventricular contractility. The beta-adrenergic response to respiratory acidosis substantially ameliorated the increase in end-systolic volume and supported the increase in venous return but did not alter the associated tachycardia or vasodilation. Respiratory acidosis, like propranolol treatment, decreases contractility by decreasing Emax.", 
    "82": "The ability of N-methyl-1,2-diphenyl ethanolamine (compound M), N-isobutyl-1,2-diphenyl ethanolamine (compound E), diltiazem and verapamil to inhibit in vitro ADP-induced platelet aggregation was examined in rat platelet-rich plasma. Pretreatment of the platelets with the compounds (0.1-3 mM) for 3 min at 37 degrees C, inhibited an ADP-induced aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. The maximum percentage inhibitions induced by compounds M, E, diltiazem and verapamil were: 95.5 +/- 6.5, 98.4 +/- 7.5, 100 and 95.9 +/- 8.3% at concentrations of 3, 0.64, 0.96 and 0.4 mM, respectively (n = 8 - 12). The inhibitory dose 50 (ID50) values for compounds M, E, diltiazem and verapamil were 1.3 +/- 0.13, 0.29 +/- 0.01, 0.44 +/- 0.03 and 0.2 +/- 0.01 mM, respectively. The antiaggregatory effects were not antagonized by methylene blue (50-200 microM), but were completely antagonized (greater than 95%) by elevation of the Ca2+ level in the platelet-rich plasma by 0.2-0.7 mM. Co-administration of (-)propranolol (17 microM) with anyone of the compounds enhanced the antiaggregatory effects. The compounds (0.1-0.2 mM) enhanced the prostacyclin (0.01 nM)-induced antiaggregatory activity. The antiaggregatory effects of the compounds are likely to be due to an inhibition of influx of Ca2+ into the platelets.", 
    "83": "The effect of serotonin and adrenaline antagonists was tested on the early embryos of mice of three lines. All the substances tested produced an arrest or inhibition of cleavage division and the appearance of anomalies. Serotonin introduced in the incubation medium was effective against some serotoninolytics. We were unable to test the protective effect of adrenaline, as in the concentrations used it has its own effect on the development. From the data obtained, a conclusion is made of the existence in early mouse embryos of the structures sensitive to serotonin and adrenaline antagonists. The assumptions is made from the previously obtained data on the presence of biogenic monoamines in early mouse embryos, of functional activity of prospective mediators of the nervous system at the earliest stages of embryonic development of mammals.", 
    "84": "To determine the response of gastric A-cells to adrenergic substances, immunoreactive glucagon was determined simultaneously in the jugular vein and in the left gastroepiploic vein of totally depancreatized dogs. Under basal conditions a significant gradient of glucagon concentrations between the jugular and gastric veins was observed, whereas plasma insulin values were almost undetectable. Intravenous administration of epinephrine elicits a prompt and significant increase in glucagon concentrations in the gastric vein which persist during the time of hormone infusion. To ensure adequate adrenergic blockade, blockers were infused before epinephrine administration. Accordingly, after phentolamine, the infusion of epinephrine failed to increase gastric glucagon concentrations, while after propranolol, epinephrine induced a significant release of gastric glucagon. These results indicate that epinephrine stimulates gastric glucagon secretion and that this effect is mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "85": "To evaluate the cardiovascular and plasma catecholamine responses to dynamic exercise in patients with cardiac neurosis (CN), treadmill testing was performed. Thirty-four patients with CN were chosen for this study based on exercise tolerance and the results were compared with those in 31 patients with organic heart disease and 12 normal subjects. Patients with CN showed an augmentation of cardiovascular and plasma catecholamine responses. The augmentation of the norepinephrine response in patients with CN was not as remarkable as that in patients with organic heart disease. On the other hand, the augmentation of the epinephrine response was greater in patients with CN than in those with organic heart disease. Administration of metoprolol (40 mg/day) for two weeks improved exercise tolerance in patients with CN. We suggest that anxiety augments both sympatho-neural and sympatho-adrenal activity and that it is the symptoms induced by the augmented cardiovascular response which reduce exercise tolerance in patients with CN.", 
    "86": "Clinical findings of 52 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were analyzed to assess the importance of the underlying etiology. Among patients with organic heart diseases, no differences were found in the VT rate, the incidence of syncope, and the number of patients who required DC shock, regardless of the difference of the underlying organic heart diseases. Patients without organic heart disease had usually more benign clinical presentations. The electrophysiologic findings of VT such as inducibility, a mode of induction and incidence of pleomorphism were similar in patients who had organic heart disease of various causes. Neither the incidence of pleomorphism nor occurrence of acceleration of VT rate was found in patients with idiopathic VT, and the incidence of VT induction was low in patients with idiopathic VT of RV origin. Patients with organic heart diseases often died suddenly, and patients when their VT rate was 200/min or higher, developed syncope, even who had normal LV function.", 
    "87": "Patients with diseases of the respiratory tract are often treated with beta 1- and/or beta 2-adrenergic agonists. As undesired side-effects the beta-agonists cause alternations in the salivary glands and their protein synthetic apparatus. This results in alterations of the protein composition of saliva, resulting in a decrease of the protective function on the teeth, among others caused by the lowered production and secretion of the salivary mucins. Therefore, the dentist must be alert on the influence of the use of drugs on the dentition of patients with respiratory tract diseases.", 
    "88": "In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) sympathetic reflexes are attenuated because of down regulation of beta receptors. Many Authors suggest that betablockers therapy can be useful in selected patients. We wanted to test if betablockers therapy could modify sympathetic reflex during nitroprusside test. We studied 20 patients: 10 were healthy volunteers and 10 were affected by CHF of different origin. They were divided in 4 groups in relation to therapy. During nitroprusside infusion we evaluated the following parameters: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrial pressure (RAP), cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). In normal subjects we observed that the heart rate increased and the PAM and SVR decreased significantly. Betablockers therapy did not modify hemodynamic response of PAM and SVR, while we did not find any modification of the heart rate. In patients with CHF we observed a decrease of PAM, MPAP, SVR and PVR. Betablockers therapy in CHF did not modify the hemodynamic response to nitroprusside test. This effect is probably due to beta adrenergic receptor down regulation that decrease the responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation evoked by vasodilatation.", 
    "89": "The aim of this study was to analyze the HR/QT relation during exercise in a group of patients with effort angina (Group B) in comparison with the same relation obtained in a group of normal subjects (Group A) comparable for age and sex. The regression analysis was carried out separately during effort in upright position and during rest in clinostatic position to avoid influences on QT by the patient's posture. During effort in patients of the Group B the regression shows a lower value of the slope and of the intercept (p less than 0.001) than those obtained in the subjects of the Group A. A similar behaviour is shown also from the regressions obtained during rest in the same groups. Thus at the highest HRs we observed a longer QT in the Group B. Moreover QT of ischemic patients in the presence of ECG signs of ischemia (ST less than or equal to 1 mm) resulted significantly longer (p less than 0.01) either during effort and at rest, respect to that obtained in Group A at comparable HRs. The analysis of the regression HR/QT after administration of atenolol 100 mg per os in a subgroup of patients of Group B clearly shows a less prolonged QT at the highest HRs where ECG ischemia frequently appears. This fact is demonstrated by the presence of a higher slope (p less than 0.05) respect to that obtained in the same group without therapy. In conclusion, myocardial transient ischemia provokes a longer QT in patients with ischemic heart disease in comparison with normal subjects. Acute therapy with atenolol per os is able to condition the regression HR/QT showing a relative shortening of QT at the highest HRs respect to that carried out in the same patients in absence of therapy.", 
    "90": "Oxidative metabolism of diltiazem (DTZ), a calcium channel blocker, was investigated in rabbit and human liver microsomes as well as in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. DTZ N-demethylation, the major metabolic pathway in man, was strongly increased by treatment of animals, patients, and hepatocyte cultures with rifampicin and other inducers of the P-450IIIA subfamily. In a reconstituted system with purified forms of P-450 and NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase, P-450IIIA7 exhibited the highest DTZ N-demethylase activity. In both rabbit and human liver microsomes, this activity was highly correlated with erythromycin demethylase, a characteristic substrate of P-450IIIA, or with an immunoquantitated level of P-450IIIA, and was specifically inhibited by anti-P-450IIIA7 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Cyclosporin A, another specific substrate of P-450IIIA in rabbit and human, competitively inhibited DTZ N-demethylase in both species. In primary cultures of human hepatocytes treated with various inducers, including rifampicin, dexamethasone, phenobarbital, phenylbutazone or beta-naphthoflavone, the rate of release of N-demethyl-DTZ in the extracellular medium was highly correlated with the intracellular level of P-450IIIA, which appeared to be strongly induced by rifampicin and phenobarbital and to a lesser extent by dexamethasone and phenylbutazone. In aggregate, these results are consistent with the view that in both rabbit and human, cytochromes P-450 from the P-450IIIA subfamily are the major enzymes involved in the N-demethylation of DTZ. Accordingly, drugs which may be specific substrates or inducers of this P-450 are likely to influence both the side effects and the efficacy of this molecule.", 
    "91": "A HPLC method has been developed that permits the sensitive determination of beta adrenergic blocking drugs, including acebutolol, metoprolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, and propranolol. These compounds were converted to their chromophoric dabsyl derivatives and were separated by a reversed phase chromatographic column (mu-Bondapak C18) with methanol-water (75:25) as isocratic mobile phase. The derivatives were detected by a variable wavelength detector operating at 430 nm. The method was applied to commercial pharmaceutical preparations and the results were statistically compared with those obtained by official methods using t- and F-tests.", 
    "92": "On the basis of a 1-year double-blind comparative study of doxazosin and atenolol in hypertensive patients, we have previously described sustained and significantly different drug effects on the blood lipid profile. The present paper presents a retrospective analysis of the smoking subgroups for each drug regimen, for both the original 12-month double-blind period and for a further 12-month open-label period. The changes in blood lipids were qualitatively and quantitatively similar in both the smoking subgroup and in the full study population (smokers and non-smokers). In the hypertensive smokers doxazosin increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (+9.4%) and decreased triglycerides (-10.9%) whereas atenolol had the opposite effect, decreasing HDL cholesterol (-5.6%) and increasing triglycerides (+20.7%). The antihypertensive effects of doxazosin (n = 24) and atenolol (n = 23) were comparable over 24 months of treatment. Eighteen (75%) doxazosin and 17 (73.9%) atenolol patients reached the blood pressure goal (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mmHg with at least a 5-mmHg reduction, or a greater than or equal to 10-mmHg reduction from baseline). As a consequence of the lowered blood pressure and favourable lipid changes, doxazosin decreased the risk of coronary heart disease (as calculated from the Framingham risk equation) by -24.4% (P less than 0.05). However, the calculated risk was not significantly reduced by atenolol (-2.1%). It is concluded that the smoking status of the patient has no obvious implications for the safety, efficacy or metabolic effects of doxazosin."
