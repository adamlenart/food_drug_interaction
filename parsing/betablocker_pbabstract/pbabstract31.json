Their clinical status was assessed with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and the EuroQoL score for quality of life. The exercise stress test (EST), coronary blood flow (CBF) response to nitrate and the cold pressor test (CPT), brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitrate-mediated dilation (NMD) were also assessed.", 
    "2": "Nine patients (45%) did not complete the ISMN phase due to side effects; 2 patients refused a follow-up. Nine patients completed the study. The SAQ and EuroQoL scores were significantly better with ISMN than with placebo, although the differences were small. No differences were found between the treatments in the EST results, CBF response to nitroglycerin (p = 0.55) and the CPT (p = 0.54), FMD (p = 0.26) and NMD (p = 0.35).", 
    "3": "In this study, a high proportion of MVA patients showed an intolerance to ISMN; in those tolerating the drug, significant effects on their angina status were observed, but the benefit appeared to be modest and independent of effects on coronary microvascular function.",

Each patient required paired echocardiograms to have been recorded at least three months apart. Clinical, biochemical and pharmacological data were collected from each patient and related to the annualized rate of increase in mean diastolic mitral gradient and stenosis severity on a scale of 0 to 3.", 
    "6": "The characteristics of the patients were as follows: mean age 71 +/- 15 years; female gender 73%; and left ventricular ejection fraction 66 +/- 13%. Diabetes was present in 50% of patients, renal insufficiency in 40%, and coronary artery disease in 50%. Over a follow up period of 2.6 +/- 2.2 years, the mean gradient was increased by 0.8 +/- 2.4 mmHg (range: 0-15 mmHg) per year, while the stenosis grade was increased by 0.18 +/- 0.5 (range: 0-3) per year. The rate of progression was faster in patients with lesser degrees of stenosis (p = 0.01) and low serum albumen levels (p = 0.04), and slower in those receiving beta-blockers (p = 0.01). Milder stenosis, diabetes mellitus and lack of beta-blocker use were independent predictors of faster DMS progression.",

Optimized separation conditions consisted on a 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH - 3.0, 20 mM RAMEB as chiral selector, + 25 kV applied voltage, 15\u00b0C temperature and UV detection at 238 nm. Using the optimized electrophoretic conditions we succeeded the chiral separation of amlodipine enantiomers in approximately 6 minute, the order of migration being R-amlodipine followed by S-amlodipine. The method was successfully applied for the determination of amlodipine enantiomers from commercially available pharmaceuticals. The linearity range, limits of detection and quantification, precision and accuracy were determined and the results obtained confirmed that the method was suitable for this purpose.",

    "24": "Cholesterol plays a strategic role in liposome composition; however, the quantity used to achieve an appropriate formulation has not been yet clarified. Therefore, by screening arrangement of lipids and cholesterol ratio, the main aim of this study is to investigate the most suitable amount of cholesterol in lipids in order to prepare stable and controlled drug release vehicles. For the preparation of liposomes, DMPC, DPPC and DSPC phospholipids were used and combined with different molar ratios of cholesterol (e.g. 100, 80-20, 70-30, 60-40 and 50-50%). Stability studies were conducted by storing the formulations at 37 and 50 \u00b0C for 30 days and by analysing them by AFM, DLS and FT-IR. By detecting the two most stable formulations from the stability results, drug encapsulation and in vitro release studies in PBS were performed by encapsulating atenolol and quinine. The release results were validated using a simulation model to ensure the reliability and suitable interpretation of the data. The generated model showed a good correlation between the prediction and the in vitro obtained results. By using 70:30% ratio (known in literature as 2:1), it is possible to reach the most stable formulation to guarantee a controlled and reproducible release for drugs with different physicochemical characteristics and pharmaceutical applications.",

She was diagnosed with Graves' disease based on the following test results: thyroid stimulating hormone < 0.01 \u03bcU/ml, free thyroxine 6.15 ng/ml, and thyrotropin receptor antibody 7.8 U/ml. Treatment with methimazole 30 mg and propranolol 30 mg was started, and her thyroid function showed improvement. However, significant manic symptoms, irritability, hallucinations, and delusions were noted, and she was hospitalized for her own protection in May 2011. Although treatment with aripiprazole 24 mg and lithium 400 mg was started, the hallucinatory and delusional symptoms persisted, necessitating adjustment of the antipsychotics. Her psychiatric symptoms showed amelioration in July 2011 after improvement in her thyroid function, and she was discharged from our hospital. After discharge, her thyroid function remained normal with methimazole 10 mg, and administration of the antipsychotics was discontinued. Affective psychotic symptoms such as altered mood and activity are frequently observed in cases with Graves' disease, but there have been few reports describing cases with full-blown psychiatric disorders manifesting with features such as hallucinations and delusions as the chief symptoms requiring hospitalized treatment, as in the present case. In symptomatic psychosis associated with Graves' disease, prolonged psychiatric symptoms might develop, and close cooperation with psychiatrists is thus important.",

For these reasons, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of \u03b2-blockers on the long-term outcomes in CHF patients with COPD. In addition, we compared the effects of two different \u03b2-blockers, carvedilol and bisoprolol.",

Acute decompensated HF patients with COPD were classified according to the oral drug used at discharge into \u03b2-blocker (n=86; carvedilol [n=52] or bisoprolol [n=34]) and non-\u03b2-blocker groups (n=46). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality between the \u03b2-blocker and non-\u03b2-blocker groups during a mean clinical follow-up of 33.9 months. The secondary endpoints were the differences in all-cause mortality and the hospitalization rates for CHF and/or COPD exacerbation between patients receiving carvedilol and bisoprolol.", 
    "29": "The mortality rate was higher in patients without \u03b2-blockers compared with those taking \u03b2-blockers (log-rank P=0.039), and univariate analyses revealed that the use of \u03b2-blockers was the only factor significantly correlated with the mortality rate (hazard ratio: 0.41; 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.99; P=0.047). Moreover, the rate of CHF and/or COPD exacerbation was higher in patients treated with carvedilol compared with bisoprolol (log-rank P=0.033). In the multivariate analysis, only a past history of COPD exacerbation significantly increased the risk of re-hospitalization due to CHF and/or COPD exacerbation (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.11; 95% confidence interval: 1.47-6.61; P=0.003).",

Among them, 109 patients had a valid pulse wave velocity measurement at 6 months. Monthly measured home BP was targeted to <140/90 mmHg by addition of antihypertensive drugs and dry weight adjustment. The difference between drugs in percentage change of aortic pulse wave velocity from baseline to 6 months was analyzed.",

Reduction in 44-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic BP was no different between groups (median [25th, 75th percentile]; atenolol: -21.5 [-37.7, -7.6] versus lisinopril: -15.8 [-28.8, -1.5] mmHg; P=0.27 for systolic BP; -14.1 [-22.6, -5.3] versus -10.9 [-18.4, -0.9] mmHg, respectively; P=0.30 for diastolic BP). Between-drug difference in change of aortic pulse wave velocity persisted after adjustments for age, sex, race, other cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline ambulatory systolic BP but disappeared after adjustment for change in ambulatory systolic BP (11.8%; 95% confidence interval, -2.3% to 25.9%; P=0.10).", 
    "34": "Among patients on dialysis, atenolol was superior in improving arterial stiffness. However, differences between atenolol and lisinopril in improving aortic stiffness among patients on hemodialysis may be explained by BP-lowering effects of drugs.",

    "39": "Infantile hemangiomas are the most common vascular tumors in childhood. In view of its proven effectiveness in such cases, propranolol is the drug of choice. We present the case of a male infant who started treatment with propranolol shortly after birth due to heart disease. After 7 months, when the patient had suffered various respiratory exacerbations, this treatment was suspended. One week later, multiple skin lesions (ie, multifocal infantile hemangiomas) began to appear, with no extracutaneous involvement. It was decided to resume treatment with propranolol, although at lower doses than before, and the skin lesions improved rapidly, with some disappearing completely. Treatment was definitively withdrawn at age 16 months, with only slight recurrence of the lesions. The case described is of multifocal infantile hemangiomas without extracutaneous involvement appearing beyond the neonatal period after treatment with propranolol beginning in the first days of life. The details of the case support the hypothesis that this drug is not only therapeutic but also plays a prophylactic role against infantile hemangiomas. In turn, this supports the recent proposal that this drug may be useful in preventing the growth and spread of tumors with high angiogenic potential. It is postulated that the inhibition of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors is associated with multiple intracellular processes related to the progression and metastasis of different tumors.",

The renal parameters, p-NOx and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were not changed by nebivolol. There was no difference between nebivolol and placebo in the response to L-NMMA, with LMMA inducing a similar increase in PWV, bBP and cBP and a similar decrease in GFR, uAQP2 and u-ENaC\u03b3 and FENa [mean change -0.62% (95% confidence interval {CI} -0.40 to -0.84) during placebo vs. -0.57% (95% CI -0.46 to -0.68; P = 0.564) during nebivolol treatment]. Vasoactive hormones were changed to a similar extend by L-NMMA during administration of nebivolol and placebo.", 
    "43": "Nebivolol did not change p-NOx , and inhibition of NO synthesis induced the same response in blood pressure, GFR, renal tubular function and vasoactive hormones during nebivolol and placebo.

A discharge regimen with statin therapy was associated with and overall reduction in 30 day, 1 year and long-term mortality. In addition, overall the triple ischemic endpoint of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke was also significantly lower in the statin vs. no-statin group. In addition, statin and beta-blockers exerted synergistic effect on overall mortality outcomes short-term and in the long-term. We note that the predictors of overall death include no therapy with statin therapy and age [hazard ratios (HR) 1.1, 95% CI: 1.04-1.078, P<0.001] and presence of renal failure (HR 2.0, P=0.005).

It is important to acknowledge that most patients with chronic illnesses do not have a single, predominant condition but suffer from multiple comorbidities. The rapid advancement in physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, as well as the increasing quantitative knowledge of disease-related pathophysiological changes, facilitate building of drug-disease models. However, there are only a few published examples of PBPK models incorporating the pathophysiological changes that occur with chronic diseases. The objective of this study was to develop PBPK models that incorporate the haemodynamic changes in hepatic and renal blood flows occurring in chronic heart failure (CHF) and to evaluate these changes in adults and children, using carvedilol as a model drug.", 
    "53": "After a comprehensive literature search to select the model input parameters, two PBPK models were developed. Model\u00a01 was based on human liver and intestinal microsome clearances, and model\u00a02 was based on clearance by specific cytochrome P450 enzymes. After evaluation of both models in healthy adults, the reduced hepatic and renal blood flows were incorporated into the developed models to predict carvedilol exposure in the adult CHF population. The adult carvedilol models were scaled down to children by using Simcyp(\u00ae) (Simcyp Ltd, Sheffield, UK). In order to show the impact of reduced organ blood flows on carvedilol disposition, the predictions in the CHF population were made with and without reductions in organ blood flows.", 
    "54": "The predictions made by both models in healthy adults were comparable and within the 2-fold error range. In adults with CHF, the mean observed/predicted ratio [ratio(Obs/Pred)] for oral clearance (CL/F) without reductions in organ blood flows was outside the 2-fold error range, i.e.\u00a00.34 (95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.37), with use of both models. The mean CL/F ratio(Obs/Pred) values after incorporation of reduced organ blood flows were 1.0 (95\u00a0%\u00a0CI 0.92-1.08) and 0.95 (95\u00a0%\u00a0CI 0.88-1.03) with use of models 1 and\u00a02, respectively. The mean ratio(Obs/Pred) values for the pharmacokinetic parameters were not improved after incorporation of reduced blood flows in paediatric patients, except in those above 17\u00a0years of age, who were categorized according to the New York Heart Association classification of CHF, where the CL/F ratio(Obs/Pred) values in two patients were closer to unity.", 
    "55": "There was a strong connection between a decrease in hepatic clearance of carvedilol and an increase in the severity of CHF, especially in adults and in paediatric patients above 17\u00a0years of age. The incorporated reductions in hepatic and renal blood flows occurring in moderate and severe CHF patients resulted in improved predictions of carvedilol exposure. The developed models can be extended to predict exposures of drugs with high hepatic extraction in the CHF population.",

Rabbit corneas received from Pel-Freez Biologicals\u00ae were used for these studies. Propranolol hydrochloride (PHCl) (1 mg/mL) was used as the paracellular permeability marker. A series of permeation studies were carried out with IPBS as the control, with CDs on the donor side only, CDs on the receiver side only, and CDs on both the donor and receiver sides. At the end of 1 or 3 h, corneas were collected and fixed using a solution containing 2%v/v glutaraldehyde\u2009+\u20092%w/v paraformaldehyde\u2009+\u2009IPBS and histological examinations were performed (Excalibur Pathology, Inc). The order of transcorneal permeability of PHCl was found to be CDs on the receiver side > control (no CDs) \u2248 CDs on both the receiver and donor sides > CDs on the donor side. Histology studies revealed that the corneal epithelial and endothelial layers remained intact in the control sets. Damage to the cornea was observed in the order of CDs on the receiver side > CDs on the donor side > CDs on both sides > control. The use of CDs in solutions for in vitro permeation experiments with rabbit corneas needs to be carefully considered to avoid confounding effects in the data obtained.", 
    "57": "A novel dinitrophenyl ether \u03b2-cyclodextrin-bonded chiral stationary phase (NESP) for HPLC was prepared with ordered mesoporous SBA-15 as matrix. The fast enantioseparation of atenolol enantiomers on the new stationary phase was achieved through the optimization of mobile phase composition, column temperature and other factors in polar organic solvent mode. The optimized composition of mobile phase was acetonitrile/methanol/glacial acetic acid/triethylamine (90:10:2.5:3.0, v/v/v/v) at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The column tem- perature was set at 20 \u00b0C. The detection wavelength was 275 nm. The resolution of atenolol enantiomers was 1.73 with a rather short analysis time, about 20 min, under the above conditions. The atenolol was extracted with methanol from the tablets and analyzed by direct injection for HPLC. A new quantitative method of atenolol enantiomers in tablets was established after the condition optimization. The good linear relationships for two atenolol enantiomers were observed in the range of 2.5-100 mg/L with r of 0. 999 2 and 0. 998 9, respectively. The recoveries of atenolol enantiomers in tablet samples were 94.60%-97.24%. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of this method were not greater than 0.92% for intra-day and 1.86% for inter-day, respectively. The detection limits (S/N = 3) of concentrations were less than 0.2 mg/L for both enantiomers. The established method is simple and of high selectivity, high recovery and low cost for enantiomer analysis by using homemade cyclodextrin-based chiral column. It has a good application prospect for the fast quality control and the pharmacokinetics study of chiral drugs.",

However, the effects of restraint stress on cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in metabolic syndrome (MetS) have remained unclear. We investigated the effects of chronic restraint stress and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) blockade on cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and metabolic disorders in a rat model of MetS. DahlS.Z-Lepr(fa)/Lepr(fa) (DS/obese) rats, derived from a cross between Dahl salt-sensitive and Zucker rats. Rats were exposed to restraint stress (restraint cage, 2 h/day) for 4 wk from 9 wk of age with or without daily subcutaneous administration of the \u03b2-AR blocker propranolol (2 mg/kg). Age-matched homozygous lean littermates of DS/obese rats (DahlS.Z-Lepr(+)/Lepr(+) rats) served as control animals. Chronic restraint stress exacerbated hypertension as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress in a manner sensitive to propranolol treatment. Restraint stress attenuated body weight gain in DS/obese rats, and this effect tended to be reversed by propranolol (P = 0.0682). Restraint stress or propranolol did not affect visceral or subcutaneous fat mass. However, restraint stress potentiated cardiac and visceral adipose tissue inflammation in DS/obese rats, and these effects were ameliorated by propranolol. Restraint stress also exacerbated glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid metabolism in a manner sensitive to propranolol. In addition, restraint stress increased urinary norepinephrine excretion, and propranolol attenuated this effect. Our results thus implicate \u03b2-ARs in the exacerbation of cardiac and adipose tissue pathology and abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism induced by restraint stress in this model of MetS.",

G proteins and their coupled receptors are well known regulators of a variety of cellular functions. The overall aim of the present study was to study the role of G-protein coupled receptor, \u03b2 adrenergic receptor on the biology and pathogenesis of keratitis isolate of Acanthamoeba castellanii of the T4 genotype. Inhibition of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor using antagonist, propranolol had detrimental effects on the extracellular proteolytic activities A.\u00a0castellanii as determined using zymographic assays. Conversely, \u03b2 adrenergic receptor agonist, isoprenaline showed increased proteases. Interestingly, \u03b2 adrenergic receptor inhibition affected A.\u00a0castellanii growth (using amoebistatic assays), viability (using amoebicidal assays by measuring uptake of Trypan blue) and encystation as determined by trophozoite transformation into the cyst form. Pre-treatment of parasites with propranolol hampered A.\u00a0castellanii-mediated human brain microvascular endothelial cell cytotoxicity, as measured by the lacatate dehydrogenase release. The aforementioned findings suggest that G-protein coupled receptor, \u03b2 adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling in A.\u00a0castellanii biology and pathogenesis may offer new pharmacological targets.",

Both clonidine and atenolol pretreatment attenuated seizure activity and reduced KA-induced changes in heart rate, QTc interval and T wave amplitude observed during both bradycardic and tachycardic phases in saline-pretreated KA animals. Clonidine, however, failed to reduce the power of EEG frequencies.

In vitro and in vivo assays have largely focused on the acute ecotoxicity of these compounds in aquatic systems. However, studies on the ecotoxicological effects of pharmaceuticals in soil biota are especially scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute toxicity of 18 pharmaceuticals (4 NSAIDs, 5 blood lipid-lowering agents, 6 \u03b2-blockers and 3 antibiotics) that are usually found in the environment by using an Eisenia fetida bioassay. In addition, the presence of these pharmaceuticals in artificial soil was verified at the end of the test. Our results indicate that seven of the studied drugs cause acute adverse effects in E. fetida, in particular, the NSAIDs and the blood lipid-lowering agents. Ibuprofen (LC50=64.80 mg/kg) caused the highest acute toxicity for all tested compounds, followed by diclofenac (LC50=90.49 mg/kg) and simvastatin (LC50=92.70 mg/kg). Other tested pharmaceuticals from NSAIDs and blood lipid-lowering families have toxicity effects, from a LC50=140.87 mg/kg for gemfibrozil to 795.07 mg/kg for lovastatin. Atorvastatin, bezafibrate, \u03b2-blockers and antibiotics showed no detectable lethality in E. fetida. The four NSAIDs showed evidence of modification of their original chemical structure after 14 days so the detected toxicity may be due to the original product as well as their degradation products. The three blood lipid-lowering agents seem to be more stable in soil. From an environmental perspective, the lethal concentrations of the tested drugs are much greater than those reported in wastewater and biosolids, therefore acute toxic effects may be improbable. However, little is known about the accumulation of these substances in soils after regular applications, so accumulative and chronic effects cannot be excluded. Moreover, more studies are needed to determine the role of the degradation products of these pharmaceuticals on terrestrial toxicity.",

Water-dispersible nanoparticles (NPs) based on these polymers were also fabricated for applications in two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging of cell membrane. Through optimization of the polymer/matrix mass ratio and the initial feed concentration of the polymer solution, a high quantum yield (QY) of 24% was achieved for the red-emitting NPs in water.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) at 10\u2009\u00b5M or gallocatechin gallate (GCG) at 30\u2009\u00b5M caused significant inhibitory effects on GSIS, and each of these at 100\u2009\u00b5M almost abolished it. In contrast, epicatechin (EC) or catechin (CA) had no effect on GSIS at concentrations up to 100\u2009\u00b5M. We thus investigated the structure-activity relationship by using epigallocatechin (EGC) and gallocatechin (GC) containing a trihydroxyl group in the B-ring, and epicatechin gallate (ECG) and catechin gallate (CG) containing the gallate moiety. EGC, GC, and ECG caused an inhibition of GSIS, although significant effects were obtained only at 100\u2009\u00b5M. At this concentration, EGC almost abolished GSIS, whereas GC and ECG partially inhibited it. In contrast, CG did not affect GSIS at concentrations up to 100\u2009\u00b5M. EGCG also abolished the insulin secretion induced by tolbutamide, an ATP-sensitive K(+) channel blocker, and partially inhibited that induced by 30\u2009mM K(+). Moreover, EGCG, but not EC, inhibited the oscillation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration induced by 11.1\u2009mM glucose. These results suggest that some catechins at supraphysiological concentrations have inhibitory effects on GSIS, the potency of which depends on their structure; the order of potency was EGCG>GCG>EGC>GC\u2248ECG. The inhibitory effects seem to be mediated by the inhibition of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, which is caused, at least in part, by membrane hyperpolarization resulting from the activation of K(+) channels.",

The results demonstrated that GSA and MSA shared a similar interaction mechanism with QPM. The QPM-GSA films had higher puncture strength than the QPM-MSA films in dry and wet states, whereas the % elongations were not different. The drug permeability of the QPM-GSA films was lower than that of the QPM-MSA films in both acidic and neutral media, but higher water uptake of the QPM-GSA films was found at neutral pH. Moreover, the QPM-MSA-coated tablets had a greater PPN release rate than the QPM-GSA-coated tablets, and drug release was dependent on the film-coating levels. In addition, the QPM-SA films at a ratio of 4:0.5 produced a stronger film and could sustain PPN release. These results indicate that the QPM-GSA films had greater film strength and lower drug permeability than the QPM-MSA films. Additionally, the QPM-SA films have a strong potential for use in sustained-release tablets.",

    "99": "Skeletal metastases are an incurable complication afflicting the majority of patients who die from advanced breast cancer. They are most often osteolytic, characterized by net bone destruction and suppressed new bone formation. Life expectancy from first diagnosis of breast cancer bone metastases is several years, during which time skeletal-related events - including pain, fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression - significantly degrade quality of life. The bone marrow niche can also confer hormonal and chemo-resistance. Most treatments for skeletal metastases target bone-destroying osteoclasts and are palliative. Recent results from the Breast cancer trials of Oral Everolimus-2 trial suggest that agents such as the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor everolimus may have efficacy against breast cancer bone metastases in part via stimulating osteoblasts as well as by inhibiting tumor growth. Selective estrogen receptor modulators similarly inhibit growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers while having positive effects on the skeleton. This review discusses the future role of bone-anabolic agents for the specific treatment of osteolytic breast cancer metastases. Agents with both anti-tumor and bone-anabolic actions have been tested in the setting of multiple myeloma, a hematological malignancy that causes severe osteolytic bone loss and suppression of osteoblastic new bone formation. Stimulation of osteoblast activity inhibits multiple myeloma growth - a strategy that might decrease breast cancer burden in osteolytic bone metastases. Proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib) inhibit the growth of myeloma directly and are anabolic for bone. Drugs with limited anti-tumor activity but which are anabolic for bone include intermittent parathyroid hormone and antibodies that neutralize the WNT inhibitors DKK1 and sclerostin, as well as the activin A blocker sotatercept and the osteoporosis drug strontium ranelate. Transforming growth factor-beta inhibitors have little tumor antiproliferative activity but block breast cancer production of osteolytic factors and are also anabolic for bone. Some of these treatments are already in clinical trials. This review provides an overview of agents with bone-anabolic properties, which may have utility in the treatment of breast cancer metastatic to the skeleton.",

The aim of this study was to analyze AVB episodes in SafeR mode based on stored electrograms (EGM), and determine the occurrence rate and risk factors for advanced AVB in a pacemaker population with SSS.", 
    "101": "The study included 50 consecutive patients with SSS without a history of advanced AVB who had a dual-chamber pacemaker programmed in SafeR mode. A total of 377 EGM stored in the pacemakers as AVB episodes fulfilling the second- or third-degree criterion were analyzed. Of 377 EGM, 73 EGM (19.4%) were appropriate episodes, whereas the other EGM did not show actual AVB, and showed atrial tachyarrhythmia, ventricular event in the blanking period, or premature atrial contractions with block. On EGM analysis, advanced AVB occurred in 9 patients (18%), and the occurrence rate was 11.7% per year. Moreover, on multivariate analysis \u03b2-blocker use was an independent risk factor for advanced AVB (OR, 9.10; P=0.004).", 
    "102": "The occurrence rate of advanced AVB in patients with SSS is much higher than previously reported, and \u03b2-blocker use is an independent risk factor for advanced AVB. SafeR is useful to detect latent AVB. Stored EGM, however, sometimes include inaccurately classified events.", 
    "103": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is activated in heart failure (HF) as a compensatory mechanism, being related to cardiac remodeling and poor prognosis. Although RAS inhibitors are used as first-line drugs for HF, plasma renin activity (PRA) is upregulated by RAS inhibitors via a negative feedback mechanism. The clinical significance of PRA during RAS inhibitor therapy is poorly understood in acute decompensated HF (ADHF). Therefore we examined the impact of PRA in HF patients already receiving RAS inhibitors.", 
    "104": "Of 611 consecutive patients with ADHF and emergency admission to hospital, we studied the impact of PRA on the prognosis of ADHF in 293 patients already receiving RAS inhibitors before admission.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were significantly higher in patients with high PRA than low PRA (log-rank P=0.0002 and P<0.0001, respectively). Log PRA was an independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular death (HR, 1.194; 95% CI: 1.378-2.678, P<0.0001; and HR, 2.559; 95% CI: 1.610-4.144, P<0.0001, respectively).",

The plasma samples were prepared by protein precipitation, then the separation of the analytes was performed on an Agilent HC-C18 column (4.6\u2009\u00d7\u2009250\u2009mm, 5\u2009\u00b5m) at a flow rate of 1.0\u2009mL/min, and post-column splitting (1:4) was used to give optimal interface flow rates (0.2\u2009mL/min) for MS detection; the total run time was 8.5\u2009min. Mass spectrometric detection was achieved using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray source interface in positive ionization mode. The method was fully validated in terms of selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, stability, matrix effect and recovery over a concentration range of 3.42-7000\u2009ng/mL for MET, 2.05-4200\u2009ng/mL for HMT and 1.95-4000\u2009ng/mL for DMT. The analytical method was successfully applied to herb-drug interaction study of MET and breviscapine after administration of breviscapine (12.5\u2009mg/kg) and MET (40\u2009mg/kg). The results suggested that breviscapine have negligible effect on pharmacokinetics of MET in rats; the information may be beneficial for the application of breviscapine in combination with MET in clinical therapy.", 
    "107": "Propranolol has been recently approved by health authorities to treat infantile haemangiomas (IH). Propranolol is indicated in infants less than 5months of age with an IH requiring systemic therapy: IH at life-threatening and/or functional risk, painful ulcerated IH and IH that may cause permanent disfigurement. Propranolol should be initiated by physicians who have expertise in the diagnosis, treatment and management of IH. In addition, the first intake and every escalation should be administrated in a controlled clinical setting where adequate facilities for handling of adverse reactions, including those requiring urgent measures, are available. Then a monthly monitoring with dose adjustment weight is mandatory by the family doctor. Parents should be informed of the risk of hypoglycaemia and bronchoconstriction, especially during respiratory infectious outbreaks. The recommended duration of treatment is 6months without tapering. Relapses are possible necessitating a second course of 3 to 6months of treatment.",

    "109": "The non-investigational study was carried out in Poland. Patients over 18 years of age with essential hypertension were recruited if they had already been switched from a free combination to the FDC at least 4 weeks prior to recruitment. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, lactation, any contraindication to the FDC, and other antihypertensive treatment. Adherence was measured by tablet count (tablets taken divided by tablets prescribed, times 100) and defined as follows: excellent >90%, good 76-90%, moderate 51-75%, bad \u226450%. Other patient data, clinical findings and laboratory values were recorded upon availability at study start, after 3 months (voluntary) and after 6 months.", 
    "110": "Data of 4288 patients (mean age: 59 years; gender: 50% each) were documented. The average daily doses of the FDC were 5.8\u2009mg bisoprolol and 6.4\u2009mg amlodipine. These doses differ only slightly from those of the free combination. After 3 months' treatment with the FDC, a dose increase was carried out in 113 patients for bisoprolol and in 126 for amlodipine. After 6 months of FDC treatment, 82% of the participants of the study showed excellent adherence and for a further 15% the adherence could be considered good. This strong adherence may have led to the observed reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 11% (Cohen's D efficient size 1.23). In addition, pulse pressure decreased from 58.8\u2009mm to 52.2\u2009mm. Also in diabetic patients (21% of the cohort), further reduction of systolic blood pressure values could be achieved (mean before 150\u2009mm, after 133), wherein the initial differences compared to patients without diabetes had disappeared. The pulse rate also changed from 75\u2009b/min to 68\u2009b/min under the FDC.", 
    "111": "These study results clearly show that the FDC leads to excellent patient adherence and therefore may result in better blood pressure control. Blood pressure control is crucial in the risk reduction of cardiovascular events. The key limitation of this study is that the study design does not allow a direct comparison of patient adherence under the free and the fixed-dose combination.", 
    "112": "Circadian rhythms govern many aspects of mammalian physiology. The daily pattern of melatonin synthesis and secretion is one of the classic examples of circadian oscillations. It is mediated by a class of neuroendocrine cells known as pinealocytes which are not yet fully defined. An established method to evaluate functional and cytological characters is through the expression of lineage-specific transcriptional regulators. NeuroD1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor involved in the specification and maintenance of both endocrine and neuronal phenotypes. We have previously described developmental and adult regulation of NeuroD1 mRNA in the rodent pineal gland. However, the transcript levels were not influenced by the elimination of sympathetic input, suggesting that any rhythmicity of NeuroD1 might be found downstream of transcription. Here, we describe NeuroD1 protein expression and cellular localization in the rat pineal gland during development and the daily cycle. In embryonic and perinatal stages, protein expression follows the mRNA pattern and is predominantly nuclear. Thereafter, NeuroD1 is mostly found in pinealocyte nuclei in the early part of the night and in cytoplasm during the day, a rhythm maintained into adulthood. Additionally, nocturnal nuclear NeuroD1 levels are reduced after sympathetic disruption, an effect mimicked by the in vivo administration of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers. NeuroD1 phosphorylation at two sites, Ser(274) and Ser(336) , associates with nuclear localization in pinealocytes. These data suggest that NeuroD1 influences pineal phenotype both during development and adulthood, in an autonomic and phosphorylation-dependent manner.", 
    "113": "Diabetes-induced kidney cell injury involves an increase in matrix protein expression that is only partly alleviated by current treatment, prompting a search for new modalities. We have previously shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) inhibits high glucose-induced protein synthesis in kidney podocytes. We tested whether tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor used to treat erectile dysfunction, ameliorates high glucose stimulation of matrix proteins by generating H2S in podocytes. Tadalafil abrogated high glucose stimulation of global protein synthesis and matrix protein laminin \u03b31. Tadalafil inhibited high glucose-induced activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and laminin \u03b31 accumulation in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Tadalafil increased AMPK phosphorylation by stimulating calcium-calmodulin kinase kinase \u03b2. Tadalafil rapidly increased the expression and activity of the H2S-generating enzyme cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) by promoting its translation. dl-Propargylglycine, a CSE inhibitor, and siRNA against CSE inhibited tadalafil-induced AMPK phosphorylation and abrogated the tadalafil effect on high glucose stimulation of laminin \u03b31. In tadalafil-treated podocytes, we examined the interaction between H2S and nitric oxide (NO). N(\u03c9)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one, inhibitors of NO synthase (NOS) and soluble guanylyl cyclase, respectively, abolished tadalafil induction of H2S and AMPK phosphorylation. Tadalafil rapidly augmented inducible NOS (iNOS) expression by increasing its mRNA, and siRNA for iNOS and 1400W, an iNOS blocker, inhibited tadalafil stimulation of CSE expression and AMPK phosphorylation. We conclude that tadalafil amelioration of high glucose stimulation of synthesis of proteins including matrix proteins in podocytes requires integration of the NO-H2S-AMPK axis leading to the inhibition of high glucose-induced mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 activity and mRNA translation.", 
    "114": "Fracture nonunions represent one of many large bone defects where current treatment strategies fall short in restoring both form and function of the injured tissue. In this case, the use of a tissue-engineered scaffold for promoting bone healing offers an accessible and easy-to-manipulate environment for studying bone formation processes in vitro. We have previously shown that mechanical prestimulation using confined compression of differentiating osteoblasts results in an increase in mineralization formed in a 3D collagen-I scaffold. This study builds on this knowledge by evaluating the short and long-term effects of blocking gap junction-mediated intercellular communication among osteogenic cells on their effectiveness to mineralize collagen-I scaffolds in vitro, and in the presence and absence of mechanical stimulation. In this study, confined compression was applied in conjunction with octanol (a general communication blocker) or 18-\u03b1-glycerrhetinic acid (AGA, a specific gap junction blocker) using a modified FlexCell plate to collagen-I scaffolds seeded with murine embryonic stem cells stimulated toward osteoblast differentiation using beta-glycerol phosphate. The activity, presence, and expression of osteoblast cadherin, connexin-43, as well as various pluripotent and osteogenic markers were examined at 5-30 days of differentiation. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, immunofluorescence, viability, histology assessments, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assessments revealed that inhibiting communication in this scaffold altered the lineage and function of differentiating osteoblasts. In particular, treatment with communication inhibitors caused reduced mineralization in the matrix, and dissociation between connexin-43 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21. This dissociation was not restored even after long-term recovery. Thus, in order for this scaffold to be considered as an alternative strategy for the repair of large bone defects, cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix interactions must remain intact for osteoblast differentiation and function to be preserved. This study shows that within this 3D scaffold, gap junctions are essential in osteoblast response to mechanical loading, and are essential structures in producing a significant amount and organization of mineralization in the matrix.",

All outcomes were compared using the data on pre - and post-gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) for these groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the radiological and clinical outcomes in the patient population following beta-blockers usage in Group A versus groups B and C. Cox regression model was used to demonstrate prognostic factors for the outcome in patients having different primaries. Overall survival period was plotted on Kaplan-Meier curves.

    "140": "Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors suppress the metabolism of the potent antihyperglycemic hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). DPP4 was recently shown to provide cardioprotection through a reduction of infarct size, but the mechanism for this remains elusive. Known interactions between DPP4 and adenosine deaminase (ADA) suggest an involvement of adenosine signaling in DPP4 inhibitor-mediated cardioprotection. We tested whether the protective mechanism of the DPP4 inhibitor alogliptin against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury involves GLP-1- and/or adenosine-dependent signaling in canine hearts. In anesthetized dogs, the coronary artery was occluded for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 6 h. A 4-day pretreatment with alogliptin reduced the infarct size from 43.1 \u00b1 2.5% to 17.1 \u00b1 5.0% without affecting collateral flow and hemodynamic parameters, indicating a potent antinecrotic effect. Alogliptin also suppressed apoptosis as demonstrated by the following analysis: 1) reduction in the Bax-to-Bcl2 ratio; 2) cytochrome c release, 3) an increase in Bad phosphorylation in the cytosolic fraction; and 4) terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay. This DPP4 inhibitor did not affect blood ADA activity or adenosine concentrations. In contrast, the nonselective adenosine receptor blocker 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline (8SPT) completely blunted the effect of alogliptin. Alogliptin did not affect Erk1/2 phosphorylation, but it did stimulate phosphorylation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Only 8SPT prevented alogliptin-induced CREB phosphorylation. In conclusion, the DPP4 inhibitor alogliptin suppresses ischemia-reperfusion injury via adenosine receptor- and CREB-dependent signaling pathways.", 
    "141": "Stimuli that activate the sympathetic nervous system, such as acute psychological stress, rapidly invoke a robust mobilization of lymphocytes into the circulation. Experimental animal studies suggest that bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (PCs) also mobilize in response to sympathetic stimulation. Here we tested the effects of acute psychological stress and brief pharmacological \u03b2-adrenergic (\u03b2AR) stimulation on peripheral PC numbers in humans.", 
    "142": "In two studies, we investigated PC mobilization in response to an acute speech task (n=26) and \u03b2AR-agonist (isoproterenol) infusion (n=20). A subset of 8 participants also underwent the infusion protocol with concomitant administration of the \u03b2AR-antagonist propranolol. Flow cytometry was used to enumerate lymphocyte subsets, total progenitor cells, total haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), early HSC (multi-lineage potential), late HSC (lineage committed), and endothelial PCs (EPCs).",

Psychological stress also induced a modest, but significant, increase in total PCs, HSCs, and EPC numbers in peripheral blood. However, infusion of a \u03b2AR-agonist did not result in a significant change in circulating PCs.", 
    "144": "PCs are rapidly mobilized by psychological stress via mechanisms independent of \u03b2AR-stimulation, although the findings do not exclude \u03b2AR-stimulation as a possible cofactor.

Valsartan is highly selective angiotensin AT1 receptor blocker and exerts its major pharmacological effect by decreasing angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction and production of aldosterone. The addition of nebivolol counteracts the effects of increased angiotensin II concentrations resulting from potent AT1 blockade. This review describes a recently completed trial establishing the efficacy of the nebivolol/valsartan combination.",

The vast majority of hypertensive patients will require at least two medications. We believe that the clinical evidence suggests that the combination of nebivolol with valsartan offers a definite clinical benefit, combining \u03b21-adrenoceptor and angiotensin AT1 receptor blockade with \u03b23 receptor activation and resultant increase in nitric oxide and vasodilation.", 
    "148": "In this work, a simple and accurate geometric pore-adsorption model was established and experimentally validated for predicting the drug loading capacity in mesoporous carbon. The model was designed according to the shape of pore channels of mesoporous carbon and the arrangement of drug molecules loaded in the pores. Three different small molecule drugs (celecoxib, fenofibrate and carvedilol) were respectively loaded in mesoporous carbon with different pore sizes. In order to test the accuracy of the established model, nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis was employed to confirm the pore structure of mesoporous carbon and to calculate the occupation volume of the adsorbed drugs. The adsorption isotherms of celecoxib were systematically investigated to describe the adsorption process. It was found that the experimental results of adsorption capacity were all in the range of the predicted values for all the tested drugs and mesoporous carbon. The occupation volumes calculated from the model also agreed well with the experimental data. These results demonstrated that the established model could accurately provide the range of drug loading capacity, which may provide a useful option for the prediction of the drug loading capacity of small molecule drugs in mesoporous materials.", 
    "149": "Memory formation is promoted by stress via the release of norepinephrine and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs). Previous data demonstrate that repeated stressor exposure increases norepinephrine turnover and \u03b2-AR signaling within the amygdala, which led to the hypothesis that some stress-induced behavioral changes are likely due to facilitated associative learning. To test this, Fischer rats were exposed to chronic mild stress for four days. On day 5, subjects (including non-stressed controls) were injected with the beta-blocker propranolol or vehicle prior to conditioning in an operant box (animals receive two mild foot shocks) or passive avoidance apparatus (animals received a foot shock upon entry into the dark chamber). Twenty-four hours later, subjects were returned to the operant box for measurement of freezing or returned to the passive avoidance apparatus for measurement of latency to enter the dark chamber. Subjects were also tested in an open field to assess context-independent anxiety-like behavior. Animals exposed to chronic stress showed significantly more freezing behavior in the operant box than did controls, and this exaggerated freezing was blocked by propranolol during the conditioning trial. There was no effect of stress on behavior in the open field. Unexpectedly, retention latency was significantly reduced in subjects exposed to chronic stress. These results indicate that chronic exposure to stress results in complex behavioral changes. While repeated stress appears to enhance the formation of fearful memories, it also results in behavioral responses that resemble impulsive behaviors that result in poor decision-making.", 
    "150": "Microwave ovens have been used extensively in organic synthesis in order to accelerate reaction rates. Here, a set up comprising a microwave oven combined with silicon carbide (SiC) plates for the controlled microwave heating of model formulations has been applied in order to investigate, if a microwave oven is applicable for accelerated drug stability testing. Chemical interactions were investigated in three selected model formulations of drug and excipients regarding the formation of ester and amide reaction products. In the accelerated stability studies, a design of experiments (DoE) approach was applied in order to be able to rank excipients regarding reactivity: Study A: cetirizine with PEG 400, sorbitol, glycerol and propylene glycol. Study B: 6-aminocaproic acid with citrate, acetate, tartrate and gluconate. Study C: atenolol with citric, tartaric, malic, glutaric, and sorbic acid. The model formulations were representative for oral solutions (co-solvents), parenteral solutions (buffer species) and solid dosage forms (organic acids applicable for solubility enhancement). The DoE studies showed overall that the same impurities were generated by microwave oven heating leading to temperatures between 150\u00b0C and 180\u00b0C as compared to accelerated stability studies performed at 40\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C using a conventional oven. Ranking of the reactivity of the excipients could be made in the DoE studies performed at 150-180\u00b0C, which was representative for the ranking obtained after storage at 40\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C. It was possible to reduce the time needed for drug-excipient compatibility testing of the three model formulations from weeks to less than an hour in the three case studies. The microwave oven is therefore considered to be an interesting alternative to conventional thermal techniques for the investigation of drug-excipient interactions during preformulation.",

This study assessed the impact of BB and ACEI doses administered following ST-elevation MI on mortality and outcome up to 1 year. METHODS\u2004AND\u2004RESULTS: The French prospective observational cohort \"RIMA\" included 1,461 MI patients. Dosing of BB and ACEI given at 24 h and at time of discharge was assessed as follows: no treatment; <50% of target dose; or \u226550% of target dose. For in-hospital mortality, after MI, the use of BB in the first 24 h, but not ACEI, was associated with significantly lower event rate on multivariate analysis (OR, 5.78; 95% CI: 2.62-12.76, P<0.001). In contrast at 1 year, use of higher doses of ACEI, but not BB, was associated with significantly lower CV mortality, readmission for heart failure and the composite of CV mortality and readmission for heart failure (HR, 2.65; 95% CI: 1.32-5.31, P=0.006 for absence of ACEI at discharge).",

    "153": "\u03b2-Adrenergic antagonist toxicity causes cardiovascular collapse often refractory to standard therapy. Alternative therapies include high-dose insulin, lipid emulsion, and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). A 47-year-old man ingested 10 g of metoprolol tartrate in a suicide attempt. Upon emergency department presentation, he was comatose, bradycardic, and hypotensive. Glucagon (14 mg IV) and vasopressor/inotropic support (epinephrine 0.1 \u03bcg/[kg min], dobutamine 10 \u03bcg/[kg min]) were administered. Despite these therapies, he developed cardiac arrest for 55 minutes, requiring epinephrine (5 mg IV) and vasopressin (40 U IV) with multiple episodes of return of spontaneous circulation. Additional vasopressor administration (vasopressin 0.04 U/min, norepinephrine 0.5 \u03bcg/[kg min]) did not improve his hemodynamics. High-dose insulin (250 U IV) and 20% lipid emulsion (100 mL bolus with 200 mL/30 min infusion) were administered, and VA-ECMO was initiated with hemodynamic improvement. His postarrest neurologic examination demonstrated lack of brainstem reflexes and cortical motor response. He awoke 11.5 hours after time of ingestion. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was discontinued at hospital day 3, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 10 with excellent neurologic recovery. A serum metoprolol level measured 25,000 ng/mL (therapeutic 20-340 ng/mL). High-dose insulin has been shown to be beneficial in \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist cardiotoxicity. Lipid emulsion is thought to act as a lipid extractor, lowering serum and tissue levels. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used with the above therapies, restoring organ perfusion and allowing intrinsic drug metabolism and elimination. High-dose insulin, lipid emulsion, and VA-ECMO should be considered for refractory cardiac arrest secondary to \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist toxicity such as metoprolol.",

Propranolol alone effectively decreased ethanol seeking more than sucrose seeking and decreased ethanol intake only. At some dose combinations, there was a greater attenuation of ethanol and sucrose intake relative to either drug alone. For Exp. 2, prazosin alone and naltrexone alone were effective in decreasing ethanol seeking and intake only. Combination treatment was more effective than either drug alone at decreasing ethanol seeking and consumption and sucrose intake, but not sucrose seeking.",

    "164": "Osteoporosis (OP) often increases the risk of bone fracture and other complications and is a major clinical problem. Previous studies have found that high blood pressure is associated with bone formation abnormalities, resulting in increased calcium loss. We have investigated the effect of the antihypertensive drug benidipine on bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) differentiation into osteoblasts and bone formation under osteoporotic conditions. We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test the hypothesis that benidipine promotes murine BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), \u03b2-catenin, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) protein expression was evaluated in primary femoral BMSCs from C57/BL6 mice cultured under osteogenic conditions for 2 weeks to examine the effects of benidipine. An ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model was used to investigate the effect of benidipine treatment for 3 months in vivo. We found that ALP, OCN, and RUNX2 expression was up-regulated and WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling was enhanced in vitro and in vivo. In OVX mice that were intragastrically administered benidipine, bone parameters (trabecular thickness, bone mineral density, and trabecular number) in the distal femoral metaphysis were significantly increased compared with control OVX mice. Consistently, benidipine promoted BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts and protected against bone loss in OVX mice. Therefore, benidipine might be a suitable candidate for the treatment of patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis and hypertension.", 
    "165": "Cigarette smoke is a risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). It contains several carcinogens known to initiate and promote tumorigenesis as well as metastasis. The nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is one of the strongest carcinogens in tobacco and our previous studies have shown its proliferation-promoting role in the progression of ESCC. Recently, NNK was identified as an agonist for both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Thus, we hypothesized that the cancer-promoting effect of NNK was likely mediated through beta-adrenoceptors in ESCC. Therefore, we investigated the comprehensive role of NNK in ESCC in vitro and in vivo, and found that NNK promoted many oncogenic features including ESCC cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth as well as ESCC cell migration and invasion. Western blotting showed that NNK induced significant up-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor as well as down-regulation of Bax. Importantly, the oncogenic effects of NNK in ESCC and the altered protein expression were reversed to some extent by down-regulation of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors with the beta2-adrenoceptor showing a greater rescue effect. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that NNK plays an oncogenic role in ESCC through beta-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, beta2-adrenoceptor might play a more important role in this process. Our findings might provide a chemoprevention and therapy strategy for cigarette smoke-related ESCC carcinogenesis.", 
    "166": "Non selective beta blockers (NSBBs) are used in primary and secondary prophylaxis of portal hypertension-related bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. The efficacy of NSBBs treatment is predicted by hemodynamic response in term of reduction of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) below 12 mmHg or at least 20% of the basal value. Nevertheless a relevant number of patients who do not achieve this HVPG reduction during NSBBs therapy do not bleed during follow up; this evidence suggests an additional non-hemodynamic advantage of NSBBs treatment to modify the natural history of cirrhosis. Recent studies have questioned the efficacy and safety of NSBBs in patients with advanced stage of liver disease characterized by refractory ascites and/or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. These studies have suggested the existence of a defined and limited period to modify the natural history of cirrhosis by NSBBs: the \"window hypothesis\". According with this hypothesis, patients with cirrhosis benefit from the use of NSBBs from the appearance of varices up to the development of an advanced stage of cirrhosis. Indeed, in patients with refractory ascites and/or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis the hemodynamic effects of NSBBs may expose to a high risk of further complications such as renal insufficiency and/or death. Methodological concerns and contrasting results counterbalance the evidence produced up to now on this issue and are the main topic of this editorial.", 
    "167": "Lasers, 595-nm pulsed dye and 1,064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), have been used successfully for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas (IHs). Recently the use of a topical \u03b2-blocker, specifically timolol maleate, has been promising in the treatment of IHs. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of topical timolol 5 mg/mL solution with that of combined sequential dual-wavelength laser in the treatment of IHs. Sixty children with IHs were divided randomly into two equal groups. Group 1 was treated with applications of timolol drops (5 mg/mL) twice daily. Group 2 was treated with sequential pulsed dye and Nd:Yag laser. Treatments were performed every month for a maximum of six sessions. Efficacy was evaluated clinically and by measuring the average hemoglobin level. A significant decrease in the average hemoglobin level was determined in both groups and a dramatic response was observed in superficial hemangiomas in the timolol group. The timolol group received treatment for an average of 4.0 \u00b1 1.1 months and the laser group for 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 months. The degree of improvement of mixed hemangiomas to laser treatment was greater than that of the timolol group. During 3 months of follow-up, no further improvement or relapse was reported in either group. Timolol solution is a safe and effective alternative to laser treatment in superficial hemangiomas. In mixed hemangiomas, the combined sequential 595-nm and 1,064-nm dual-wavelength laser provided better results than timolol solution because it penetrated deeply so that deep dermal blood vessels were reached.",

Fifty-five per cent of patients presented with acute decompensated chronic HF, while 45% had new-onset HF. Mean age was 59\u2009\u00b1\u200915 years, 63% were males, and 83% were Gulf citizens. Co-morbid conditions were hypertension (61%), diabetes mellitus (50%), CAD (47%), and atrial fibrillation or flutter (14%).

    "171": "Heart failure (HF) is a disease of epidemic proportion and is associated with exceedingly high health care costs. G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase 2 (GRK2), which is up-regulated in the failing human heart, appears to play a critical role in HF progression in part because enhanced GRK2 activity promotes dysfunctional adrenergic signaling and myocyte death. Recently, we found that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine could inhibit GRK2 with selectivity over other GRKs. Wild-type mice were treated for 4 weeks with paroxetine starting at 2 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI). These mice were compared with mice treated with fluoxetine, which does not inhibit GRK2, to control for the SSRI effects of paroxetine. All mice exhibited similar left ventricular (LV) dysfunction before treatment; however, although the control and fluoxetine groups had continued degradation of function, the paroxetine group had considerably improved LV function and structure, and several hallmarks of HF were either inhibited or reversed. Use of genetically engineered mice indicated that paroxetine was working through GRK2 inhibition. The beneficial effects of paroxetine were markedly greater than those of \u03b2-blocker therapy, a current standard of care in human HF. These data demonstrate that paroxetine-mediated inhibition of GRK2 improves cardiac function after MI and represents a potential repurposing of this drug, as well as a starting point for innovative small-molecule GRK2 inhibitor development.",

In univariable logistic regression, factors associated with R2 were age (p=0.02), non-ischemic etiology of HF (p<0.001), NYHA functional class (p=0.02), baseline LVEF (p=0.005), absence of left bundle branch block (LBBB; p=0.002), ST2 (p=0.004), NT-proBNP (p=0.005), and hs-cTnT (p<0.001); HF duration achieved borderline significance (p=0.08). In multivariable analysis, ST2 remained the only biomarker associated with LV-R2. We developed the ST2-R2 score for use in clinical practice for predicting R2; variables included were ST2 <48 ng/mL, non-ischemic etiology, absence of LBBB, HF duration <12 months, baseline LVEF <24%, and \u03b2-blocker treatment.

Lowering of heart rate improves cardiovascular outcome in these patients. Therefore, heart rate reduction is an important element of therapeutic management and consistently reflected in current European guidelines for heart failure. Methods: The INDICATE study was initiated as a multicenter nationwide cross-sectional survey aiming to analyze the current quality of care in outpatients with CHF (documented left ventricular systolic dysfunction) in Germany. 20 consecutive patients were to be included in the survey from February until June 2012 by 793 cardiologic private practices. Detailed documentation of each patient was performed using a standardized questionnaire.",

In 42\u2005% of patients the heart rate was \u2265 75\u2005min\u207b\u00b9. 86\u2005% were treated with betablockers. However, higher doses of betablockers were not associated with lower resting heart rate. 27\u2005% of patients remained on heart rates \u2265 75 min\u207b\u00b9 although receiving at least 50\u2005% of betablocker target dose.",

The REF/NYHA class II group had a higher proportion of males than the REF/NYHA class III/IV group. For angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and \u03b2-blockers, prescription rates were high and comparable between groups.

Caution for use is advised in patients with significant cardiorespiratory disease due to known cases of exacerbations of angina and arrhythmias. However, its cardiotoxicity profile is not as well recognised as other monoclonal antibodies such as transtuzumab. We report a case of a 66-year-old man who developed Takotsubo's cardiomyopathy (TC) after an elective infusion of rituximab. This case is exceptional in that rituximab has not been linked to TC, and the vast majority of chemotherapy-linked and immunotherapy-linked TC reactions have occurred during initial infusions. We also discuss the different mechanisms which link TC to immunotherapy and chemotherapy, and propose that there may be a potential for risk-stratifying recipients of this frequently used immunotherapy prior to administering treatment.",

Calcium channel blockers have been identified to have protective effect on neurons. Thus, therapy targeting both AChE and calcium channels is supposed to be more effective in AD treatment. In the present study, we explored the effect of a synthesized juxtaposition of an AChE inhibitor and a Calcium channel blocker (named (-)SCR1693) on tau phosphophorylation and A\u03b2 generation. The results showed that: (1) Compared with higher concentrations, (-)SCR1693 incubation in low concentrations such as 0.4, 2, 4\u03bcM for 24h did not affect the cell viability of HEK293/tau (HEK293 cells stably transfected with human tau40) and N2a/APP (N2a cells stably transfected with human APP) cells; (2) long-term treatment of cells with (-)SCR1693 (0.4, 2, 5\u03bcM) (24h) induced tau dephosphorylation and reduced the total tau level in HEK293/tau cells. Short-term treatment (6h) also resulted in tau dephosphorylation, but did not reduce the total tau level; and (3) (-)SCR1693 (0.4, 2, 4\u03bcM) incubation inhibited A\u03b2 generation and release dramatically in N2a/APP cells. We conclude that the novel tacrine-dihydropyridine hybrid (-)SCR1693 in low concentrations could reduce total and phosphorylated tau levels, inhibit the generation and release of A\u03b2 in cells. Thus, (-)SCR1693 may be a potential candidate for effectively treating AD.", 
    "195": "Hypertensive treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (BAAs) has been successfully applied for four decades. These drugs have a beneficial effect on the health of the patients by both decreasing number of deaths and improving morbidity. Nevertheless, the BAAs differ in pharmacological properties. They have different lipophilicity, different adrenoceptor selectivity and/or varying additional abilities in cardiac tissue and periphery vasculature hereby exceeding their known receptor-blocking effects. Nebivolol shows nitric oxide-mediated vasodilating properties that improve arterial rigidity. Carvedilol has anti-oxidative and antiproliferative effects, which exert a beneficial effect on patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). These findings suggest that the true potential of the third-generation BAAs and their value in the treatment of CHF, hypertension and following cardiovascular events has yet to be acknowledged. This MiniReview provides an overview of the third-generation BAAs and their effects on the vasculature of hypertensive patients and patients with CHF. Additionally, BAAs that potentially can be used in different patient groups are discussed.",

Propranolol inhibited norepinephrine-induced cell invasion by reducing the expression of MMP-9, VEGF, and p-cofilin. NO and VEGF release induced by norepinephrine was decreased by propranolol pretreatment, coincident with alterations in the phosphorylation of Akt, eNOS, and VEGFR-2. Tube formation ability and subsequent levels of NO and VEGF elevated by norepinephrine were distinctively counteracted in HemECs.",

    "203": "The noradrenergic system, driven by locus coeruleus (LC) activation, plays a key role in the regulating and directing of changes in hippocampal synaptic efficacy. The LC releases noradrenaline in response to novel experience and LC activation leads to an enhancement of hippocampus-based learning, and facilitates synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) that occur in association with spatial learning. The predominant receptor for mediating these effects is the \u03b2-adrenoreceptor. Interestingly, the dependency of synaptic plasticity on this receptor is different in the hippocampal subfields whereby in the CA1 in vivo, LTP, but not LTD requires \u03b2-adrenoreceptor activation, whereas in the mossy fiber synapse LTP and LTD do not depend on this receptor. By contrast, synaptic plasticity that is facilitated by spatial learning is highly dependent on \u03b2-adrenoreceptor activation in both hippocampal subfields. Here, we explored whether LTP induced by perforant-path (pp) stimulation in vivo or that is facilitated by spatial learning depends on \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. We found that under both LTP conditions, antagonising the receptors disabled the persistence of LTP. \u03b2-adrenoreceptor-antagonism also prevented spatial learning. Strikingly, activation of the LC before high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the pp prevented short-term potentiation but not LTP, and LC stimulation after pp-HFS-induced depotentiation of LTP. This depotentiation was prevented by \u03b2-adrenoreceptor-antagonism. These data suggest that \u03b2-adrenoreceptor-activation, resulting from noradrenaline release from the LC during enhanced arousal and learning, comprises a mechanism whereby the duration and degree of LTP is regulated and fine tuned. This may serve to optimize the creation of a spatial memory engram by means of LTP and LTD. This process can be expected to support the special role of the dentate gyrus as a crucial subregional locus for detecting and processing novelty within the hippocampus.", 
    "204": "The \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a physiologically important transmembrane protein that is a target for drugs used for treatment of asthma and cardiovascular diseases. Study of the first steps of ligand recognition and the molecular basis of ligand binding to the orthosteric site is essential for understanding the pharmacological properties of the receptor. In this work we investigated the characteristic features of the agonist association-dissociation process to and from the different conformational forms of \u03b22-AR by use of advanced molecular modeling techniques. The investigation was focused on estimating the free energy profiles (FEPs) corresponding to the process of a full agonist ((R,R)-fenoterol) and an inverse agonist (carazolol) binding and unbinding to and from \u03b22-AR. The two different conformational forms of \u03b22-AR, i.e. active \u03b22-AR-PDB: 3P0G and inactive \u03b22-AR-PDB: 2RH1 were included in this stage of the study. We revealed several significant qualitative differences between FEPs characteristic of both conformational forms. Both FEPs suggest the existence of three transient binding sites in the extracellular domain of \u03b22-AR. Comparison of the residues surrounding these transient binding sites in both \u03b22-AR states revealed the importance of the aromatic residues F194, H93(2.64), H296(6.58), and H178 (extracellular part of \u03b22-AR) in the early stages of the binding process. In addition, slightly different exit and entry paths are preferred by the ligand molecule in the extracellular part of \u03b22-AR, depending on the conformation of the receptor.", 
    "205": "We investigated the presence of \u03b23-adrenoceptor and its functional effects on pacemaker potentials in colonic interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) from mice. The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used to record pacemaker potentials in cultured ICCs and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect the mRNA transcript levels \u03b2-adrenoceptors. The \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL37344, reduced the frequency of pacemaker potentials in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of BRL37344 were blocked by the pretreatment of propranolol, a nonspecific \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not by the selective \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol and the selective \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist butoxamine. \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonists SR59230A and L748337 blocked the inhibitory effects of BRL37344. RT-PCR revealed mRNA transcripts of \u03b21- and \u03b23-adrenoceptor, but not \u03b22-adrenoceptor, in c-kit- and Ano-1-positive colonic ICCs. The K(+) channel blockers tetraethylammonium, apamin, and glibenclamide did not block the effects of BRL37344. N(\u03c9)-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME), an NO synthase inhibitor, and chelerythrine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, also did not block the effects of BRL37344. Noradrenaline mimicked the effects of BRL37344 in colonic ICCs. However, the inhibitory effects of noradrenaline on pacemaker potentials were blocked only by pretreatment with atenolol but not by butoxamine, SR59230A, or L748337. In small intestinal ICCs, BRL37344 had no effect on pacemaker potentials and mRNA transcripts of \u03b21-and \u03b22-adrenoceptor, but not \u03b23-adrenoceptor were detected. These results suggest that \u03b23-adrenoceptors are present in colonic ICCs and may play a role in regulating gastrointestinal motility by the inhibition of pacemaker potentials."
