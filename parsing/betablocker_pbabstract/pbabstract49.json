In 11 young normotensive individuals, ultrasound measures of ICA and VA flow were obtained in normoxia (baseline) and following 60, 210, and 330 min of hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.11). Ninety minutes prior to final assessment, participants received an \u03b11-adrenoreceptor blocker (prazosin, 1 mg/20 kg body mass) or placebo. Compared with baseline, following 60, 220, and 330 min of hypoxia, global CBF [(ICAFlow + VAFlow) \u2217 2] increased by 160 \u00b1 52 ml/min (+28%; P = 0.05), 134 \u00b1 23 ml/min (+23%; P = 0.02), and 113 \u00b1 51 (+19%; P = 0.27), respectively. Compared with baseline, ICAFlow increased by 23% following 60 min of hypoxia (P = 0.06), after which it progressively declined. The percentage increase in VA flow was consistently larger than ICA flow during hypoxia by \u223c20% (P = 0.002). Compared with baseline, ICA and VA diameters increased during hypoxia by \u223c9% and \u223c12%, respectively (P \u2264 0.05), and were correlated with reductions in SaO2. Flow and diameters were unaltered following \u03b11 blockade (P \u2265 0.10). In conclusion, elevations in global CBF during acute hypoxia are partly mediated via greater increases in VA flow compared with ICA flow; this regional difference was unaltered following \u03b11 blockade, indicating that a heightened sympathetic nerve activity with hypoxia does not constrain further dilation of larger extracranial blood vessels.",

    "14": "The \u03b21-adrenoceptor exists in two agonist conformations/states: 1) a high-affinity state where responses to catecholamines and other agonists (e.g., cimaterol) are potently inhibited by \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonists, and 2) a low-affinity secondary conformation where agonist responses, particularly CGP12177 [(-)-4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazol-2-one] are relatively resistant to inhibition by \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonists. Although both states have been demonstrated in many species (including human), the precise nature of the secondary state is unknown and does not occur in the closely related \u03b22-adrenoceptor. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and functional measurements of production of a cyclic AMP response element upstream of a secreted placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene and accumulation of (3)H-cAMP, we examined the pharmacological consequences of swapping transmembrane (TM) regions of the human \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoceptors, followed by single point mutations, to determine the key residues involved in the \u03b21-adrenoceptor secondary conformation. We found that TM4 (particularly amino acids L195 and W199) had a major role in the generation of the secondary \u03b21-adrenoceptor conformation. Thus, unlike at the human \u03b21-wild-type adrenoceptor, at \u03b21-TM4 mutant receptors, cimaterol and CGP12177 responses were both potently inhibited by antagonists. CGP12177 acted as a simple partial agonist with similar KB and EC50 values in the \u03b21-TM4 but not \u03b21-wild-type receptors. Furthermore pindolol switched from a biphasic concentration response at human \u03b21-wild-type adrenoceptors to a monophasic concentration response in the \u03b21-TM4 mutant receptors. Mutation of these amino acids to those found in the \u03b22-adrenoceptor (L195Q and W199Y), or mutation of a single residue (W199D) in the human \u03b21-adrenoceptor thus abolished this secondary conformation and created a \u03b21-adrenoceptor with only one high-affinity agonist conformation.",

In 10-20% of cases IHs are able to generate complication and medical/surgical intervention is needed. For many decades standard treatment consisted in oral or intralesional corticosteroids until Leaute-Labreze and colleagues published the first report on the efficacy of propranolol for cutaneous infantile hemangiomas in 2008. IHs can be sometimes part of complex syndrome. Here we report the case of a patient with tetralogy of Fallot operated at 5 month of age who stopped propranolol treatment for hypoxic spells and unusually developed facial and subglottic IHs configuring the diagnosis of PHACES syndrome (posterior fossa brain malformations, hemangioma, arterial anomalies, cardiac defects and/or aortic coarctation, ocular anomalies and sternal defects). To our knowledge this is the first report in the international literature of a delayed appearance of an infantile hemangioma involving the skin and the airways (PHACES syndrome). The pathophysiological explanation relies on the mechanism of action of propranolol which seems to act initially with vasoconstriction, down-regulating proangiogenetic factors and inducing endothelial cell apoptosis. Many decades since their introduction \u03b2-blockers are useful in a growing group of diseases.

    "25": "Acute administration of the stress hormone corticosterone enhances memory consolidation in a manner that is dependent upon the modulatory effects of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA). Posttraining administration of corticosterone increases expression of the activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) in hippocampal synaptic-enriched fractions. Interference with hippocampal Arc expression impairs memory, suggesting that the corticosterone-induced increase in hippocampal Arc plays a role in the memory enhancing effect of the hormone. Blockade of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the BLA attenuates the corticosterone-induced increase in hippocampal Arc expression and blocks corticosterone-induced memory enhancement. To determine whether posttraining corticosterone treatment affects Arc protein expression in synapses of other areas of the brain that are involved in memory processing, a memory-enhancing dose of corticosterone was administered to rats immediately after inhibitory avoidance training. As seen in the hippocampus, Arc protein expression was increased in synaptic fractions taken from the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Blockade of Arc protein expression significantly impaired memory, indicating that the protein is necessary in the mPFC for long-term memory formation. To test the hypothesis that blockade of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the BLA would block the effect of systemic corticosterone on memory and attenuate mPFC Arc expression, as it does in the hippocampus, posttraining intra-BLA microinfusions of the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol were given concurrently with the systemic corticosterone injection. Although this treatment blocked corticosterone-induced memory enhancement, it increased corticosterone-induced Arc protein expression in mPFC synaptic fractions. These findings suggest that the BLA mediates stress hormone effects on memory by participating in the negative or positive regulation of corticosterone-induced synaptic plasticity in efferent brain regions.",

Although the neurobiology of cocaine's rewarding effects has been well studied, the mechanisms underlying its anxiogenic effects remain unclear. We used two behavioral assays to study these opposing actions of cocaine: a runway self-administration test and a modified place conditioning test. In the runway, the positive and negative effects of cocaine are reflected in the frequency of approach-avoidance conflict that animals develop about entering a goal box associated with cocaine delivery. In the place conditioning test, animals develop preferences for environments paired with the immediate/rewarding effects of cocaine, but avoid environments paired with the drug's delayed/anxiogenic actions. In the present study, these two behavioral assays were used to examine the role of norepinephrine (NE) transmission within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), each of which has been implicated in drug-withdrawal-induced anxiety and stress-induced response reinstatement. Rats experienced 15 single daily cocaine-reinforced (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) runway trials 10 min after intracranial injection of the \u03b21 and \u03b22 NE receptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI 118551 or vehicle into the CeA or BNST. NE antagonism of either region dose dependently reduced approach-avoidance conflict behavior compared with that observed in vehicle-treated controls. In addition, NE antagonism selectively interfered with the expression of conditioned place aversions while leaving intact cocaine-induced place preferences. These data suggest a role for NE signaling within the BNST and the CeA in the anxiogenic actions of cocaine.",

    "55": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exaggerated (oncogenic) function is currently targeted in cancer treatment with drugs that block receptor ligand binding or tyrosine kinase activity. Because endocytic trafficking is a crucial regulator of EGFR function, its pharmacological perturbation might provide a new anti-tumoral strategy. Inhibition of phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphohydrolase (PAP) activity has been shown to trigger PA signaling towards type 4 phosphodiesterase (PDE4) activation and protein kinase A inhibition, leading to internalization of empty/inactive EGFR. Here, we used propranolol, its l- and d- isomers and desipramine as PAP inhibitors to further explore the effects of PAP inhibition on EGFR endocytic trafficking and its consequences on EGFR-dependent cancer cell line models. PAP inhibition not only made EGFR inaccessible to stimuli but also prolonged the signaling lifetime of ligand-activated EGFR in recycling endosomes. Strikingly, such endocytic perturbations applied in acute/intermittent PAP inhibitor treatments selectively impaired cell proliferation/viability sustained by an exaggerated EGFR function. Phospholipase D inhibition with FIPI (5-fluoro-2-indolyl des-chlorohalopemide) and PDE4 inhibition with rolipram abrogated both the anti-tumoral and endocytic effects of PAP inhibition. Prolonged treatments with a low concentration of PAP inhibitors, although without detectable endocytic effects, still counteracted cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and decreased anchorage-independent growth of cells bearing EGFR oncogenic influences. Overall, our results show that PAP inhibitors can counteract EGFR oncogenic traits, including receptor overexpression or activating mutations resistant to current tyrosine kinase inhibitors, perturbing EGFR endocytic trafficking and perhaps other as yet unknown processes, depending on treatment conditions. This puts PAP activity forward as a new suitable target against EGFR-driven malignancy.",

Furosemide and propranolol were the drugs, medium-chain triglyceride was the oil, and Cremophors ELP, RH40, and RH60 were the surfactants. Pellets were prepared by extrusion/spheronization with emulsions (75% water and 25%, w/w, oil/surfactant/drug). Stability of the emulsions was evaluated from changes in the back-scattered light, and re-emulsification and drug release from light transmittance and UV spectroscopy, respectively. Emulsion stability increased because of the incorporation of the drugs. Re-emulsification depended only on the surfactant content and was expressed by a simple power equation (Ra2 > 0.945, Q(2) > 0.752). Drug release was expressed by two biexponential equations (Ra2 > 0.989, Q(2) > 0.699 and Ra2 > 0.947, Q(2) > 0.693) implying initial burst and terminal slow release phase and by the linear form (Lineweaver-Burke) of Michaelis-Menten equation (Ra2 > 0.726, Q(2) > 0.397).

This has been explained by tagging of the hippocampal synapses used in extinction, followed by capture of proteins from the synapses that process novelty. The effect is blocked by the inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis following the novelty or the extinction. Here, we show that it can also be blocked by the postextinction or postnovelty intrahippocampal infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphono pentanoic acid; the inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide; or the blocker of L-voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs), nifedipine. Inhibition of proteasomal protein degradation by \u03b2-lactacystin has no effect of its own on extinction or on the influence of novelty thereon but blocks the inhibitory effects of all the other substances except that of rapamycin on extinction, suggesting that their action depends on concomitant synaptic protein turnover.

It has been found that increase of iron and hydrogen peroxide concentration accelerate the degradation of atenolol and metoprolol, while the kinetics of the process can be characterized as pseudo-first order. In general the photo-Fenton method has proved to be effective in decomposing and mineralizing the target compounds. The determination of the by-products formed during the degradation using LC-MS/MS equipment and the evaluation of the toxicity of the treated solution in different stages of the process would offer significant, innovative information regarding the treatment of water and wastewater containing active pharmaceutical compounds, especially of the \u03b2-blocker group.",

Ten subjects were removed prematurely from the trial because of clinically significant increases in blood pressure and/or heart rate requiring immediate intervention with IV rescue medications including a selective \u03b2 -1 blocker. The observed drug-related changes in vital signs were of clinical relevance and might explain some of the cardiovascular morbidity reported in patients receiving D2 receptor agonist in clinical settings.

Nonselective beta-blockers, in the recommended dose range, did not showed a convincing dose-response relationship by direct comparison. The once (1x) and twice (2x) starting dose subgroups contained the largest sample size. The estimate of BP lowering efficacy for nonselective beta-blockers by combining the 1x and 2x starting dose subgroup was -10 mmHg (95% CI -11 to -8) for systolic BP and -7 mmHg (95% CI -8 to -6) for diastolic BP (low-quality evidence). Nonselective beta-blockers starting at the 1x recommended starting doses lowered heart rate by 12 beats per minute (95% CI 10 to 13) (low-quality evidence). The dose-response relationship in heart rate was evident by both direct and indirect comparison. Due to imprecision, there was no clear evidence of an effect of nonselective beta-blockers on pulse pressure in any dose subgroups except for a small reduction with the 2x starting dose (-2.2 mmHg, 95% CI -3.7 to -0.7) (very low quality evidence). The point estimates in the 1x, four times (4x) and eight times (8x) starting dose subgroups were similar to the 2x starting dose subgroup. Therefore, it would appear that if nonselective beta-blockers do lower pulse pressure, the magnitude is likely to be about 2 mmHg.

This estimate is likely exaggerated due to the presence of extreme outliers and other sources of bias. If we removed the extreme outliers from the analysis, the estimate for non-selective beta-blockers was lower (-8/-5 mmHg (systolic/diastolic)). Nonselective beta-blockers did not show a convincing graded dose-response in the recommended dose range for systolic BP and diastolic BP, while higher dose nonselective beta-blockers provided greater reduction of heart rate. Using higher dose nonselective beta-blockers might cause more side effects, such as bradycardia, without producing an additional BP lowering effect.

Sorption isotherms for metoprolol (>99% protonated in the tested pH of around 6) in competition with mono- and divalent inorganic cations (Na(+), NH4(+), Ca(2+), and Mg(2+)) were determined in order to assess their influence on cation exchange processes and to identify the role of further sorptive interactions. The obtained sorption isotherms could be described well by an exponential function (Freundlich isotherm model) with consistent exponents (about 0.8). In general, a decreasing sorption of metoprolol with increasing concentrations in inorganic cations was observed. Competing ions of the same valence showed similar effects. A significant sorption affinity of metoprolol with ion type dependent Freundlich coefficients KF,0.77 between 234.42 and 426.58 (L/kg)(0.77) could still be observed even at very high concentrations of competing inorganic cations. Additional column experiments confirm this behavior, which suggests the existence of further relevant interactions beside cation exchange. In subsequent batch experiments, the influence of mixtures with more than one competing ion and the effect of a reduced negative surface charge at a pH below the point of zero charge (pHPZC\u00a0\u2248\u00a02.5) were also investigated. Finally, the study demonstrates that cation exchange is the most relevant but not the sole mechanism for the sorption of metoprolol on silica gel.",

L-\u03b2-ODAP caused a prolonged rise of intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)]i) in rat spinal cord MNs, and the [Ca(2+)]i accumulation was inversely proportional to the MN's life span. The [Ca(2+)]i rise induced by L-\u03b2-ODAP or (S)-AMPA was antagonized completely by NBQX, an AMPA-receptor blocker. However, blocking the L-type Ca(2+) channel with nifedipine significantly lowered [Ca(2+)]i induced by (S)-AMPA, but not that by L-\u03b2-ODAP. Tetrodotoxin completely extinguished the [Ca(2+)]i rise induced by (S)-AMPA or kainic acid, whereas that induced by L-\u03b2-ODAP was only attenuated by 65.6\u00b16% indicating the prominent involvement of voltage-independent Ca(2+) entry. The tetrodotoxin-resistant [Ca(2+)]i induced by L-\u03b2-ODAP was blocked by 2-APB, Gd(3+), La(3+), 1-(\u03b2-[3-(4-methoxy-phenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SKF-96365) and flufenamic acid, which all are blockers of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels.

Therefore, in the present study, it was hypothesized that by formulating mucoadhesive particles, the residence time in the GIT and release of drug may be prolonged that will enhance the bioavailability of metoprolol succinate. Metoprolol succinate loaded chitosan microparticles were prepared by ionic gelation method. The optimized microparticles were coated with sodium alginate to form a layer over chitosan microparticles to increase the mucoadhesive strength and to release the drug in controlled manner. Coated and uncoated microparticles were evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, drug loading and in vitro drug release. The coated microparticles showed comparatively less drug release in the 0.1 N HCl while sustained release in PBS (pH 6.8) as compared to uncoated microparticles. The in vivo study on albino rats demonstrated an increase in bioavailability of the coated microparticles as compared to marketed formulation.

None of the patients developed adverse reactions related to the treatment with propranolol. The results of the study indicate that the treatment of vascular hyperplasia, such as subfold hemangioma with the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol is both efficacious and safe for the patients.

    "130": "In the developing cerebral cortex, the marginal zone (MZ), consisting of early-generated neurons such as Cajal-Retzius cells, plays an important role in cell migration and lamination. There is accumulating evidence of widespread excitatory neurotransmission mediated by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the MZ. Cajal-Retzius cells express not only GABAA receptors but also \u03b12/\u03b2 subunits of glycine receptors, and exhibit glycine receptor-mediated depolarization due to high [Cl(-)]i. However, the physiological roles of glycine receptors and their endogenous agonists during neurotransmission in the MZ are yet to be elucidated. To address this question, we performed optical imaging from the MZ using the voltage-sensitive dye JPW1114 on tangential neocortical slices of neonatal rats. A single electrical stimulus evoked an action-potential-dependent optical signal that spread radially over the MZ. The amplitude of the signal was not affected by glutamate receptor blockers, but was suppressed by either GABAA or glycine receptor antagonists. Combined application of both antagonists nearly abolished the signal. Inhibition of Na(+), K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporter by 20 \u00b5M bumetanide reduced the signal, indicating that this transporter contributes to excitation. Analysis of the interstitial fluid obtained by microdialysis from tangential neocortical slices with high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that GABA and taurine, but not glycine or glutamate, were released in the MZ in response to the electrical stimulation. The ambient release of taurine was reduced by the addition of a voltage-sensitive Na(+) channel blocker. Immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy indicated that taurine was stored both in Cajal-Retzius and non-Cajal-Retzius cells in the MZ, but was not localized in presynaptic structures. Our results suggest that activity-dependent non-synaptic release of endogenous taurine facilitates excitatory neurotransmission through activation of glycine receptors in the MZ.",

Once hospitalized, patients may continue to be intermittently agitated and have persistent aggressive behaviors, preventing their discharge back into the community. Managing agitation quickly with effective pharmacological agents can avoid further escalation to aggression and violence. In the acute setting, this usually involves the parenteral use of antipsychotics, with or without benzodiazepines. Within the past decade, short-acting intramuscular formulations of second-generation antipsychotics have become available and provide a means to induce calm with a substantially lower risk of acute dystonia or akathisia compared with haloperidol. New alternative formulations that avoid injections include inhalation and sublingual administration. Longer-term management of persistent aggressive behavior by reducing the frequency and intensity of future episodes of agitation is more complex. In contrast to agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania, no agents have yet been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of persistent aggressive behavior. The strongest evidence supports the use of clozapine as an antihostility agent, followed by olanzapine.

They generally present several weeks following birth as a red stromal mass. Recent reports of cutaneous and orbital infantile hemangiomas involuting in response to oral or topical beta blocker treatment suggest that infantile conjunctival hemangiomas could respond similarly. We report 2 cases of presumed infantile hemangiomas of the conjunctiva. One, associated with cutaneous hemangiomas, did not respond to oral propranolol; the other was isolated and resolved with topical timolol.", 
    "158": "Fatal ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure are the common modes of death in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantation reduces arrhythmic mortality to a significant extent in the high risk patient. However, there continues to be a need for effective drug therapy to reduce the arrhythmic and overall mortality in patients with or without an ICD. Although anti-arrhythmic drugs (AAD) appear inferior to ICD, the role of beta-blockers and to an extent amiodarone along with non AAD like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), mineralocorticoid blockers (MRB) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) need to be emphasized. There have been many drug trials and meta-analysis to this effect and we review the role of drugs especially in their ability to reduce arrhythmic mortality and sudden cardiac death (SCD). The focus is on post myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure patients with a brief overview of role of drugs in channelopathies.",

After the introduction of the NICE guidelines there was an increase in the NICE recommended monotherapy (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.19-1.75) compared with the underlying trend. Compared to black patients, an increase in the use of recommended monotherapy was observed in younger non-black patients (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.17-1.91) but not in older non-black patients (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.74).",

    "167": "Although cases of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) induced akathisia have often been reported in literature, this adverse effect has not adequately been mentioned in major pharmacology textbooks. As a result, SSRIinduced akathisia is very frequently under-recognized. A review of literature showed that almost all frequently used SSRIs such as Fluvoxamine, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram have been reported to be causing akathisia. SSRI-induced restless legs syndrome and movement disorders have also been reported. However, Escitalopram-induced akathisia is rare. In our review of literature, we could find only one single case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia. And this specific SSRI drug has rarely been implicated with occurrence of restless legs syndrome and extra-pyramidal side-effects like dytonia etc. Here, we present a case of Escitalopram-induced severe akathisia - a 53year old female, who had developed severe akathisia after taking Escitalopram for a few days. According to the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), her Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia Score was 5 i.e. severe akathisia. As per Naronjo Adverse Drug Reaction Scale the probability of association of this adverse reaction with Escitalopram was 7 (i.e. probable). Her symptoms continued in spite of prompt discontinuation of the drug. But, she improved rapidly with the use of Propranolol and Clonazepam. On the last follow-up, she was free from any symptoms. As new generation antidepressants are rarely associated with extra-pyramidal symptoms, the recognition of such adverse effects requires a high index of suspicion. Early recognition of the symptoms and discontinuation of the offending agent along with supportive therapy like a short course of benzodiazepines, beta-adrenergic antagonists or anticholinergics may rapidly relieve the patient from this distressing symptom.",

This single-center retrospective study was conducted to determine if lower heart rate during the early postoperative phase is associated with improved long-term outcomes after surgery for patients with type A acute aortic dissection. We reviewed 434 patients who underwent aortic repair between 1990 and 2011. Based on the average heart rate on postoperative days 1, 3, 5, and 7, 434 patients were divided into four groups, less than 70, 70-79, 80-89, and greater than 90 beats per minute. The mean age was 63.3 \u00b1 12.1 years. During a median follow-up of 52 months (range 16-102), 10-year survival in all groups was 67%, and the 10-year aortic event-free rate was 79%. The probability of survival and being aortic event-free using Kaplan-Meier estimates reveal that there is no significant difference when stratified by heart rate. Cox proportional regression analysis for 10-year mortality shows that significant predictors of mortality are age [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.06; p = 0.001] and perioperative stroke (HR 2.30; 95% CI 1.18-4.50; p = 0.024). Neither stratified heart rate around the time of surgery nor beta-blocker use at the time of discharge was significant. There is no association between stratified heart rate in the perioperative period with long-term outcomes after repair of type A acute aortic dissection.

The influence of tri-sodium citrate (TSC) on release behaviour was investigated through in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption. Linear and nonlinear (quadratic, cubic, sigmoid functions) deconvolution based in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) models were developed using in vitro dissolution data and bioavailability profile. Prediction errors were investigated for Cmax and AUC in the light of US FDA guidelines for average percent prediction error.

Elective operations should be postponed, until the arrhythmias and myocardial function are well tolerated. There has been no guideline on the anesthetic management of this serious, despite rare, disease and there are a few reports of the patients undergoing operation under either general or regional anesthesia. The most important issue of the anesthetic management is to avoid excessive sympathetic stimulation, especially beta stimulation which can easily induce life-threatening arrhythmias. Also, it is better to avoid adrenalin as an adjunct to the local anesthetics. Anesthetic maintenance was performed with volatile anesthetics except halothane, opiates, muscle relaxants except pancuronium and intravenous anesthetics including propofol, ketamine and benzodiazepines. Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure is recommended and transesophageal echocardiography, if available, provides diagnostic information for an intraoperative cardiac event. It is essential to apply alpha-adrenergic agonists instead of beta-agonists for intraoperative hemodynamic support. The arrhythmias should be managed with beta-blockers or amiodarone. Adequate control of postoperative analgesia and nausea/vomiting is also important to suppress sympathetic activities.",

It is caused by more than 1,400 mutations in 11 or more genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. In the absence of evidence of any other cardiac or systemic disease that could have resulted in the hypertrophic event, diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy requires a hypertrophied non-dilated left ventricle. It is associated with a significant risk for anesthesia. During anesthesia in patients diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it is essential to maintain relatively slow heart rate, prevent hypovolemia, maintain or increase systemic vascular resistance, and avoid propofol as the sole anesthetic agent. Hence, balanced anesthesia is preferable in these patients. Furthermore, transesophageal echocardiography is very useful for intraoperative assessment and development of a strategy for improving left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and mitral regurgitation (MR). LVOTO with MR resulting from systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve often leads to hemodynamic collapse. Although patients who develop SAM have been managed with intravenous volume loading, reduction/discontinuation of inotropic drugs, and increasing afterload, these strategies have often been ineffective.

In vitro, with isolated platelets, dl-nebivolol and l-nebivolol, but not d-nebivolol and bisoprolol, increased platelet cGMP and NOx formation. Treatment with dl-nebivolol and l-nebivolol increased phophorylated eNOS in platelets.", 
    "217": "Our data show that dl-nebivolol exerts an antithrombotic activity by stimulating the formation of NO by platelets, and that this effect is generated by its l-enantiomer, whereas the d-enantiomer exerts a weak antiplatelet effect because of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-independent stimulation of adenyly cyclase. These results confirm that platelet-derived NO plays a role in thrombosis prevention and it may represent a target of pharmacological intervention.",

    "220": "Retrospective cohort study conducted within a single pediatric institution's multidisciplinary vascular anomaly program for patients with NIH treated between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2011. Three NIH cohorts were compared: prepropranolol (20 in group 1; 2003-2009), propranolol (25 in group 2; 2009-2011), and nonpropranolol (13 in group 3; 2009-2011) treatment.",

    "222": "The study plan was created to detect a change in invasive therapy for NIH. Data collected included presenting age, sex, affected nasal subunits, infantile hemangioma morphologic characteristics, treatment type and number, and primary treating service. An NIH grading system, based on nasal subunit involvement, helped quantify treatment change. Descriptive statistics summarized data, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluated propranolol use and the likelihood of invasive treatments (surgical excision or laser).", 
    "223": "Of the 95 patients identified, 58 met inclusion criteria: 20 in group 1 (mean age,\u20094.8 months), 25 in group 2 (mean age,\u20094.9 months), and 13 in group 3 (mean age,\u20094.9 months). Nasal infantile hemangiomas involved the nasal tip subunit in 33 of 58 patients (56.9%). Eight of 13 patients (61.5%) in group 3 frequently had small NIH (grade 1). Patients in group 2 were less likely to undergo any invasive treatments (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.73), have surgical excision only (0.45; 0.15-1.38), or undergo laser treatment only (0.44; 0.27-0.78) compared with those in group 1. Patients with higher-grade NIH had more medical or invasive therapy, but invasive procedures were carried out in each subgroup defined by grade.",

    "232": "We found that NE upregulated the expression of VEGF, IL-8 and IL-6 in vitro and stimulated tumor growth in vivo, which was mediated by \u03b2-AR/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and could be inhibited by propranolol, a \u03b2-blocker for hypertension for decades.", 
    "233": "This research indicates exogenous norepinephrine attenuates the efficacy of sunitinib, and a combination of sunitinib and propranolol might be suggested as a new strategy in solid tumor in clinic.",

Isolated severe TBI was defined as an intracranial injury with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or greater excluding all extracranial injuries AIS score of 3 or greater. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics on admission, injury profile, Injury Severity Score (ISS), AIS score, in-hospital morbidity, and \u03b2-blocker exposure were abstracted for analysis. The primary outcome evaluated was in-hospital mortality stratified by preinjury \u03b2-blockade exposure.",

When comparing the demographics and injury characteristics between the groups, the sole difference was age, with the \u03b2-blocked group being older (69 [12] years vs. 63 [13] years, p < 0.001). \u03b2-blocked patients had a higher rate of infectious complications (30% vs. 19%, p = 0.04), with no difference in cardiac or pulmonary complications between the cohorts. Patients exposed to \u03b2-blockade versus no \u03b2-blockade experienced 13% and 22% mortality, respectively (p = 0.01). Stepwise logistic regression predicted the absence of \u03b2-blockade exposure as a risk factor for mortality (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-4.8; p = 0.002). After adjustment for significant differences between the groups, patients not exposed to \u03b2-blockade experienced twofold increased risk of mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-3.7; p = 0.004).",
