    "0": "Patients with diabetes are at high risk for cardiovascular (CV) events and heart failure. Approximately 2-3 million diabetics in the U.S. have had a history of prior CV events. The prevalence of diabetes in patients with heart failure ranges from 24% reported in clinical trials to 47% among hospitalized patients, and an estimated 1-2 million persons in the U.S. have diabetes and heart failure. Diabetes substantially increases the risk of mortality after acute coronary syndromes and also increases the risk of hospitalizations and mortality in patients with heart failure. It is now recognized that activation of multiple neurohormonal systems is central in the pathophysiology of diabetes, CV events, and heart failure. Pharmacologic intervention in these systems (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, aldosterone-receptor antagonism, and beta-blockade) has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in diabetics with prior CV events and/or heart failure. Despite this awareness, ACE inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, and beta-blockers are underutilized, and deaths and hospitalizations caused by CV events and heart failure in diabetic patients have steadily increased. Concerns about an increased incidence of hypoglycemia, worsening dyslipidemia, and decreased insulin sensitivity resulting from the use of beta-blockers may be preventing physicians from prescribing these agents for diabetic patients. Beta-blockade in conjunction with ACE inhibition should be standard therapy for all diabetic patients. Optimal glycemic control therapy for patients with heart failure has not been well-defined, and there is an urgent need for randomized clinical trials to determine optimal treatment.", 
    "1": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary, usually familial, disorder of heart muscle whose primary feature is muscular hypertrophy without recognized cause that encroaches on the ventricular chamber, reducing chamber area and volume. In roughly 25% of cases, there is associated obstruction to left ventricular outflow (hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [HOCM]). This article details the mechanism of obstruction in HOCM, focusing on obstruction at the mitral valve level, and reviews the pharmacologic and surgical therapies currently available. Mainstays of pharmacologic therapy include b-blockers, calcium channel blockers (verapamil in particular), and/or disopyramide. Surgical therapies include septal myotomy/myectomy, which has become the gold standard to which other therapies are compared, and mitral valve replacement. During the past 10 years, atrio-ventricular sequential pacing and alcohol septal ablation have been proposed as less invasive alternatives to surgery. A single, optimal therapy for patients with HOCM and refractory symptoms has not been established, and decisions regarding surgical versus noninvasive therapies need to be individualized based on functional status, comorbidities, local expertise in the surgical and nonsurgical techniques, and patient preference.",

    "6": "The beta-blocker nebivolol is a racemic mixture of D- and L- enantiomers that displays negative inotropic as well as direct vasorelaxant activity. In addition, it has been proposed that nebivolol exerts endothelium-protective effects caused by its antioxidant properties. In the present study we investigated the effect of D-, L-, and d/l-nebivolol on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced endothelial damage and compared it with carvedilol and metoprolol. Isolated rat aortic rings were exposed to ROS by electrolysis of the organ bath medium. Before and after electrolysis, endothelial function was measured by preconstricting the vessels with phenylephrine followed by the addition of methacholine. Carvedilol and nebivolol protected against ROS-induced endothelial damage, whereas metoprolol did not. The protective effect of nebivolol proved not to be stereoselective. Furthermore, we attempted to determine whether nebivolol acts a scavenger itself or whether another mechanism is involved. By means of HPLC measurements it was shown that nebivolol concentrations were decreased after exposure to electrolysis-induced ROS, thus indicating that nebivolol is degraded by its reaction with ROS. Functional experiments, in the rat aorta, demonstrated that exposure of nebivolol to ROS also affects its vasodilator activity. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that nebivolol alleviates ROS-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. This protective effect is very likely the result of a direct ROS-scavenging action by the nebivolol molecule itself.", 
    "7": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, with an incidence of 17-33%, after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and it increases the cost of operative treatment. beta-Blocker therapy reduces markedly the incidence of postoperative AF. The more effective preventive methods, e.g. amiodarone therapy or atrial pacing, are not cost-effective for all the patients. Thus, identification of patients at high risk of AF after CABG would be helpful. This review summarizes the predictors of postoperative AF and the current methods for risk stratification. In summary, identification of the patients at high risk of postoperative AF remains a challenge. The clinical usefulness of most of the conventional factors, e.g. age or history of AF, is low. Even attempts to build logistic regression models based on the pre- and intraoperative variables have failed to provide powerful predictors for postoperative AF after CABG. From the new predictors, the P-wave duration in signal-averaged ECG looks promising. Sensitivity and negative predictive value are high, positive predictive value remains low, which limits its usefulness. Contrary, even detailed analysis of standard 12-lead ECG or measure of heart rate variability has failed to provide useful information for risk stratification. A new method for risk stratification has been developed in our centre. The diagnostic accuracy of high-rate atrial pacing seems to be sufficient to identify a group of patients to whom prophylactic treatment could be proactively targeted. Further experience is, however, warranted to verify significance of this method in everyday clinical practice.", 
    "8": "The noradrenergic system may mediate some of the acute physiological effects of nicotine and nicotine withdrawal symptoms. This study examined the effects of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, on acute physiological and subjective effects of intravenous nicotine and on tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Five female and four male smokers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Following overnight abstinence from smoking, subjects were treated orally with a single 100- or 200-mg dose of labetalol or placebo in each of three experimental sessions. Two hours after the medication treatment, subjects received an intravenous injection of 15 microg/kg nicotine. The nicotine-induced increases in heart rate were attenuated with the high dose of labetalol. No treatment effects were found for systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes. For the subjective effects of nicotine, treatment with both high and low doses of labetalol enhanced the ratings of \"head rush\" and \"drug strength.\" The attenuation of tobacco withdrawal symptoms following intravenous nicotine administration was significantly greater with high-dose labetalol treatment, compared with placebo. These results support the proposed role of adrenergic receptors in nicotine withdrawal symptoms. The utility of adrenergic blockers, in combination with nicotine replacement therapies, for smoking cessation needs to be examined further in controlled clinical trials.",

Control group (n = 15): no hypotension was performed (MAP > 70 mmHg). The cytosolic liver enzyme alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) and standard liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase) were measured at the following timepoints: preoperative (T0), at the end of surgery (T1), 2 h (T2), 24 h (T3) and 48 h (T4) postoperatively.",

The response of the heart rate to suprathreshold stimulation increased from the 21st to 100th day. By contrast, during beta-adrenoceptor blockade the heart rate response decreased.

    "14": "The following report illustrates the case of a 40-year old patient, who was transferred to our hospital because of a symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). The documented VT showed typical left bundle branch block morphology with an inferior axis, which was accompanied by repolarization abnormalities in the right precordial leads, as revealed by the surface ECG. While coronary angiography allowed the exclusion of an obstructive coronary heart disease and confirmed an intact left ventricular function, the right ventricular angiography as well as the MRI demonstrated not only reduced right ventricular function but also regional abnormalities of contraction in the inferior and diaphragmal regions and typical \"outpouchings\" and \"bulgings\". The MRI also provided evidence for sporadic fatty infiltrations of the right ventricle. In the electrophysiological study, sustained VT could be reproducibly induced, while showing the typical RVOT configuration, which corresponded to the clinically apparent VT. Since these examination results matched with the criteria of McKenna et al., arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. The patient underwent implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and medical treatment with metoprolol. This particular case report was selected because it shows a typical presentation of an ARVC. Furthermore, the present example offers the possibility of demonstrating that in the case of an ARVC in the regions of the right ventricle, arrhythmogenic areals can also be found which seem morphologically inconspicuous.", 
    "15": "1. In visceral smooth muscles, both M(2) and M(3) muscarinic receptor subtypes are found, and produce two major metabolic effects: adenylyl cyclase inhibition and PLCbeta activation. Thus, we studied their relevance for muscarinic cationic current (mI(CAT)) generation, which underlies cholinergic excitation. Experiments were performed on single guinea-pig ileal cells using patch-clamp recording techniques under conditions of weakly buffered [Ca(2+)](i) (either using 50 microm EGTA or 50-100 microm fluo-3 for confocal fluorescence imaging) or with [Ca(2+)](i) 'clamped' at 100 nm using 10 mm BAPTA/CaCl(2) mixture. 2. Using a cAMP-elevating agent (1 microm isoproterenol) or a membrane-permeable cAMP analog (10 microm 8-Br-cAMP), we found no evidence for mI(CAT) modulation through a cAMP/PKA pathway. 3. With low [Ca(2+)](i) buffering, the PLC blocker U-73122 at 2.5 microm almost abolished mI(CAT), in some cases without any significant effect on [Ca(2+)](i). When [Ca(2+)](i) was buffered at 100 nm, U-73122 reduced both carbachol- and GTPgammaS-induced mI(CAT) maximal conductances (IC(50)=0.5-0.6 microm) and shifted their activation curves positively. 4. U-73343, a weak PLC blocker, had no effect on GTPgammaS-induced mI(CAT), but weakly inhibited carbachol-induced current, possibly by competitively inhibiting muscarinic receptors, since the inhibition could be prevented by increasing the carbachol concentration to 1 mm. Aristolochic acid and D-609, which inhibit PLA(2) and phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC, respectively, had no or very small effects on mI(CAT), suggesting that these enzymes were not involved. 5. InsP(3) (1 microm) in the pipette or OAG (20 microm) applied externally had no effect on mI(CAT) or its inhibition by U-73122. Ca(2+) store depletion (evoked by InsP(3), or by combined cyclopiazonic acid, ryanodine and caffeine treatment) did not induce any significant current, and had no effect on mI(CAT) in response to carbachol when [Ca(2+)](i) was strongly buffered to 100 nm. 6. It is concluded that phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC modulates mI(CAT) via Ca(2+) release, but also does so independently of InsP(3), DAG, Ca(2+) store depletion or a rise of [Ca(2+)](i). Our present results explain the previously established 'permissive' role of the M(3) receptor subtype in mI(CAT) generation, and provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the shifts of the cationic conductance activation curve.", 
    "16": "Blood flow mediates the metabolic and endocrine roles of adipose tissue. We have previously shown that the postprandial adipose tissue blood flow (ATBF) increase is dependent on insulin sensitivity. However, subcutaneous local insulin delivery had no demonstrable effect on either preprandial or postprandial ATBF. We hypothesized that insulin may act indirectly via sympathetic activation, mainly in the postprandial period, and that nitric oxide may be an overall major regulator of subcutaneous ATBF.",

Healthy subjects (body mass index, 18 to 31 kg/m2) were challenged with 75 g glucose for endogenous stimulation of ATBF. We used the novel \"microinfusion\" technique, which allows for simultaneous local delivery of pharmacological agents (or contralateral saline) and measurement of ATBF with the 133Xe washout method. Compared with control, the preprandial ATBF was not affected by propranolol but was increased by 21% (P<0.013) and 15% (P=0.004) with phentolamine and yohimbine, respectively. A decrease of 42% (2.97+/-0.33 versus 4.75+/-0.47 mL x min(-1) x 100 g tissue(-1), P<0.01) was seen with L-NMMA. The postprandial response was blunted by 58% (0.81+/-0.42 versus 1.90+/-0.44 mL x min(-1) x 100 g tissue(-1), P<0.004) with propranolol, but neither phentolamine, yohimbine, or L-NMMA altered this response.",

They have been supplanted by sumatriptan-like drugs ('triptans'), which, while keeping some of the ergot\u015b mechanisms of action, show improved safety profiles due to their increased receptor selectivity. However, triptans are still far from being perfect drugs: they can constrict human coronary arteries at therapeutic doses and, therefore, are contra-indicated in the presence of cardiovascular disease. Another problem with these agents is recurrence of moderate-to-severe pain within 24 h of initial headache relief. While mechanism-driven drug design has led to the development of various novel, albeit still imperfect, acute antimigraine medications, only a few new prophylactic agents have been made available to migraine clinicians. The efficacy of most, if not all of them has been discovered serendipitously. This is probably due to the fact that, while the pathophysiology of a migraine attack is now reasonably understood, the mechanisms leading to an attack are still mostly unknown. This update analyses the profile of some antimigraine drugs in clinical trials, their mode of action and their potential advantages or drawbacks over already available agents.", 
    "30": "Recent studies have shown that rapid atrial activation causes atrial electrical remodeling (AER), which recovers quickly following withdrawal of stimulation. The underlying mechanisms, however, are incompletely understood. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to characterize the effect of the vagus on AER as well as define possible mechanisms of the phenomenon. Eight dogs were used in the study for 3 consecutive protocols. In the first, the dogs were subjected to atrial pacing at 800 ppm for 7 hours. Every hour, pacing was interrupted for a short time and atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was measured at 6 sites. The rapid atrial pacing was then discontinued and the electrophysiological study was repeated every hour for another 7 hours. Time-domain parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were also computed 1 hour before pacing as well as each of 7 hours after the rapid atrial pacing protocol. The second program was performed two weeks after the first; 0.04 mg/kg of atropine was administered intravenously 30 min before pacing, and then 0.007 mg/kg was added at each hour. Parameters of HRV were not evaluated. Finally, the 8 dogs were subjected to the third protocol 2 weeks after completion of the second; 0.2 mg/kg of propranolol was given intravenously 30 min before pacing, and 0.04 mg/kg was added at each hour. The dispersion of AERP (dAERP) was calculated as, maximum AERP minus minimum AERP. There was a prompt decrease in AERP as the result of pacing (P<.05), but dAERP did not change significantly. The AERP recovered quickly, and dAERP increased from 21 +/-5.3 ms to 40 +/- 7.4 ms (P<.05) after cessation of pacing. At the same time, the parameters of HRV increased (P<.05) after cessation of pacing. The AERP increased from 128 +/- 12 ms to 135 +/- 12 ms and from 127 +/- 12 ms to 142 +/- 14 ms (P<.05) after vagal and autonomic blockade. However, AERP decreased during pacing (P<.05) with vagal or autonomic blockade, but dAERP did not change significantly during or after pacing. These results suggest that vagal and autonomic blockade can not prevent AER, but a high vagal tone is associated with a high dAERP during recovery from AER, indicating that the vagus and sympathetic have a synergistic effect on the refractory period.",

Carvedilol is an alpha(1)/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with antioxidant, neuroprotective, cardioprotective and vascularprotective properties, and is used to treat hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and congestive heart failure. However, its impact on mitochondrial function during acute prolonged ischaemia is unknown. We aimed to study the effect of carvedilol on cardiac mitochondrial function during acute ischaemia, using Wistar rat hearts perfused with a Langendorff system, and then submitted to ischaemia in the presence and absence of carvedilol. We determined the electrical potential of the mitochondrial membrane, O(2) consumption by the respiratory chain, energy charge and the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. In our model, carvedilol had a preferential action on phosphorylation, increasing the mitochondrial energy charge (0.76+/-0.03 vs. 0.65+/-0.01 arbitrary units; P<0.05) and decreasing the phosphorylation lag phase (28.64+/-4.23 vs. 62.4+/-11.63 s; P<0.05) during ischaemia.

Pretreatment with a combination of (+/-)-2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide methanesulfonate (CGP20712A, a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride (ICI-118,5511, a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) (0.1 microM for each) produced a 14-fold rightward shift of the concentration-response curve for (-)-isoprenaline; however, the relaxation in response to (+/-)-CGP12177A was unaffected by the blockade of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors. In the presence of CGP20712A and ICI-118,551 (0.1 microM for each), the concentration-response curves for (-)-isoprenaline and (+/-)-CGP12177A were shifted to the right by a nonselective beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist, (+/-)-bupranolol (3 and 10 microM). These results clearly suggest that beta(3)-adrenoceptors are involved in beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle.", 
    "50": "Conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter to sinus rhythm results in a transient mechanical dysfunction of atrium and atrial appendage, termed atrial stunning. Atrial stunning has been reported with all modes of conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter to sinus rhythm including both transthoracic and low energy internal electrical, pharmacological, and spontaneous cardioversion, and conversion by overdrive pacing and by radiofrequency ablation. Atrial stunning is a function of the underlying arrhythmia becoming apparent at the restoration of sinus rhythm, not the function of the mode of conversion, and does not develop after the unsuccessful attempts of cardioversion or the delivery of electric current to the heart during rhythms other than atrial fibrillation or flutter. Tachycardia-induced atrial cardiomyopathy, cytosolic calcium accumulation, and atrial hibernation are the suggested mechanisms of atrial stunning. Atrial stunning is at maximum immediately after cardioversion and improves progressively with a complete resolution within a few minutes to 4-6 weeks depending on the duration of the preceding atrial fibrillation, atrial size, and structural heart disease. Atrial stunning causes postcardioversion thromboembolism despite restoration of sinus rhythm. Duration of anticoagulation therapy after successful cardioversion should depend on the duration of atrial stunning. Lack of improvement in cardiac output and functional recovery of patients immediately after cardioversion is attributed to the atrial stunning. Verapamil, acetylstrophenathidine, isoproterenol, and dofetilide have been reported to protect from atrial stunning in animal and small human studies. Right atrium stunning is less marked and improves earlier than that of left atrium, resulting in a differential atrial stunning explaining the rare occurrence of pulmonary edema after cardioversion.", 
    "51": "Heart failure is accompanied by stereotypic alterations in cardiac gene expression. These changes are most likely secondary in the pathogenesis and can be viewed as protective, e.g. as energy-saving mechanisms, but at the same time, they aggravate contractile dysfunction and the deficit of failing cardiac myocytes to respond to altered hemodynamic needs. One of the best-studied, paradigmatic examples of this dichotomy is heterologous desensitization of the cardiac adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling pathway. It protects against detrimental consequences of the excessive adrenergic drive, but it also blunts the most powerful inotropic support of the heart. Desensitization is associated with downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, increased beta-adrenoceptor kinases and increased inhibitory G protein alpha-subunits, G(alphai). Whereas a causative role of the former is generally accepted, the role of the increase in G(alphai) has remained controversial for many years. The present article summarizes early and novel findings that, in the view of the authors, provide solid evidence for G(alphai) to play an important role in the adaptation of cardiac AC to various pathophysiological conditions.",

Conventional management of patients with stable angina includes glyceryl trinitrate, a beta-blocker, aspirin and a statin, with the aim of controlling symptoms and reducing the risk of a coronary event. For patients unable to tolerate a beta-blocker, the choice is less clear but calcium channel blockers and long-acting nitrates provide effective symptom control. Another option is nicorandil (Ikorel--Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer), a potassium channel activator licensed for the \"prevention and long term treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris\". In our review of nicorandil 8 years ago, we concluded that it provided symptom control that was as good as, but no better than, other less expensive anti-anginal drugs. Since then, new data have suggested that nicorandil might reduce the frequency of coronary events in patients with stable angina. Here, we consider these findings and reassess the place of nicorandil for patients with angina.",

Thus, the identification of a putative source of cardiomyocyte progenitors is of great interest to provide a usable model in vitro and new perspective in regenerative therapy. As adipose tissues were recently demonstrated to contain pluripotent stem cells, the emergence of cardiomyocyte phenotype from adipose-derived cells was investigated. We demonstrated that rare beating cells with cardiomyocyte features could be identified after culture of adipose stroma cells without addition of 5-azacytidine. The cardiomyocyte phenotype was first identified by morphological observation, confirmed with expression of specific cardiac markers, immunocytochemistry staining, and ultrastructural analysis, revealing the presence of ventricle- and atrial-like cells. Electrophysiological studies performed on early culture revealed a pacemaker activity of the cells. Finally, functional studies showed that adrenergic agonist stimulated the beating rate whereas cholinergic agonist decreased it. Taken together, this study demonstrated that functional cardiomyocyte-like cells could be directly obtained from adipose tissue. According to the large amount of this tissue in adult mammal, it could represent a useful source of cardiomyocyte progenitors.",

We performed ablation during VF of the left anterior PM in hearts with (N=6) or without (N=6) cytochalasin infusion, the LV lateral epicardium (Epi group, N=3), and the LV endocardium (Endo group, N=3). The PM was also ablated in 3 hearts without propranolol (control group). Propranolol converted multiple-wavelet VF to slow VF with reentry localized to the PM. Propranolol decreased the maximal slope of the APDR curve (P<0.001) as well as its spatial heterogeneity (P<0.01) and conduction velocity (P=0.01) while increasing the VF cycle length (P<0.001). PM ablation terminated VF during propropranolol infusion with (6 of 6, 100%) or without (4 of 6, 67%) cytochalasin D and significantly reduced inducibility.

The method is based on the production of a green, water-soluble complex with ferric ions in acid medium. The automated lab-made FIA system was used for the direct determination of bopindolol in tablets. Bopindolol was adsorbed onto the solid phase in a mini-column, which was integrated directly into the flow system. The positive feature of the use of solid phase extraction (SPE) was the pre-concentration of bopindolol (seven times). The sample throughput was 50 samples per hour. Using the SPE method, bopindolol was determined with a linear range from 125 to 1000 microg ml(-1) (Relative standard deviation (R.S.D.)=1.87%), with a detection limit (3sigma) of 70 microg ml(-1).

This is especially true for those patients with frequent migraines who are in danger of developing drug-induced headaches. Migraine prophylaxis should be taken in consideration in patients who suffer from 7 or more migraine days per month in spite of all non-pharmacological efforts. When choosing a prophylactic drug not only efficacy but tolerability and safety for long-term intake should be considered. Prophylactic drugs used to be classified as drugs of first, second and third choice. According to this step care model treatment was started with a drug of first choice and only in case of lack of efficacy or adverse events a drug of lower choice was selected. Today, in contrast to the traditional step care a stratified care is favored. Treatment is individualized based on an assessment of the patients' medical needs, on comorbidity, the migraine phenotype and most importantly the individual situation of the patient in life.

    "76": "In recent years, several risk factors for adverse outcome in patients undergoing anaesthesia have been identified. Besides human errors, cardiovascular and respiratory complications are associated with substantial morbidity. Assessment of complications has promoted the introduction of basic physiological monitoring in clinical practice. Whether monitoring directly affects outcome is not proven; however, circumstantial evidence suggests that basic cardiorespiratory monitoring decreases the incidence of serious accidents. Prevention of hypothermia also reduces anaesthesia-related morbidity. Measurement of body temperature is mandatory, and active warming is a simple, effective technique to avoid hypothermia. Evidence is growing that patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease should be treated with beta blockers perioperatively. Whether the type of anaesthesia-ie, general or regional-is relevant to perioperative mortality remains unclear. In subgroups of patients at high risk, neuraxial anaesthesia reduces the rate of respiratory and cardiovascular complications.", 
    "77": "Galantamine is currently used to treat Alzheimer's disease patients; it behaves as a mild blocker of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and has an allosteric modulating action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In this study, we observed that galantamine prevented cell death induced by the peptide beta-amyloid(1-40) and thapsigargin in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, as well as in bovine chromaffin cells. The protective effect of galantamine was concentration-dependent in both cell types; maximum protection was produced at 300 nM. The antiapoptotic effect of galantamine at 300 nM, against beta-amyloid(1-40) or thapsigargin-induced toxicity, was reversed by alpha-bungarotoxin. At neuroprotective concentrations, galantamine caused a mild and sustained elevation of the cytosolic concentration of calcium, [Ca2+]c, measured in single cells loaded with Fura-2. Incubation of the cells for 48 h with 300 nM galantamine doubled the density of alpha7 nicotinic receptors and tripled the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results strongly suggest that galantamine can prevent apoptotic cell death by inducing neuroprotection through a mechanism related to that described for nicotine, i.e. activation of nAChRs and upregulation of Bcl-2. These findings might explain the long-term beneficial effects of galantamine in patients suffering of Alzheimer's disease.",

However, their clinical use is limited because some patients are adversely affected by their side effects. The discovery of cardioselective (beta(1)-selective) blockers has overcome some of the problems. Current retrospective studies have revealed that vasodilating beta-blockers (so-called beta-blockers of the third generation) have advantages over the conventional type of beta-blockers in terms of minimizing the adverse effects and improving the disease-derived dysfunction, thus enhancing the quality of life variables. Some of the possible advantages include improvement of insulin resistance, decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in association with increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, attenuation of bronchial asthma attack and respiratory dysfunction, alleviation of coronary vasospasm provocation, peripheral circulatory disturbances, and erectile dysfunction, and better patient compliance. Release of nitric oxide, antioxidant action, beta(2)-adrenoceptor activation, Ca(2+) entry blockade, and other mechanisms underlying the vasodilating action may be responsible for the beneficial therapeutic effects of these agents.",

We have recorded the responses of two hard tick species (Acari: Ixodidae) in vitro to determine if such products can disrupt the perception of an attractant in a repellent assay or the perception of an arrestment stimulus in a deterrent assay. Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (EBAAP), N,N-diethyl-methyl-benzamide (deet), permethrin and indalone were chosen to test their capacity to inhibit the attraction of Amblyomma variegatum Fabricius to its aggregation-attachment pheromone. Vapours of each test product plus those from a synthetic blend of the pheromone were delivered to the walking tick in an air stream on a locomotion compensator. Neither EBAAP, deet, permethrin nor indalone could inhibit attraction of A. variegatum even when each of the test products was delivered at 106 times the pheromone. Indalone did decrease the attraction of A. variegatum to the pheromone and induced repulsion of A. variegatum when presented on its own in the air stream. The effect of permethrin, a sodium channel blocker, was also tested in a deterrent assay measuring the arrestment of Ixodes ricinus (L.) adults on its own faeces and faecal constituents. Permethrin deterred arrestment at doses of 670 fg/cm2 to 67 ng/cm2, i.e. at levels five times lower than the dose of chemostimuli present in the arrestment stimulus. This sensitivity to permethrin suggests that it acts via the contact chemoreception channel.",

The solutions were prepared using operating conditions usually employed in the sol-gel synthesis of SiO2-TiO2 materials. In accord with the well-known procedures for controlling the different chemical reactivities of the alkoxides, the pre-hydrolysis of the slower reacting silicon ethoxide and the chelation by acetylacetone of the faster reacting titanium butoxide were performed before mass spectrometric analysis. While LDI-MS did not provide evidence for the presence of mixed Si-Ti species in samples obtained from these reactions, MALDI-MS of samples diluted with chloroform and using 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) as matrix led to detection of various oligomers with different contents of Si and Ti atoms.

    "119": "We investigated consequences of cardiac arrest on sarcolemmal and mitochondrial effects of ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP) opener, P-1075, in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts. Depolarised cardiac arrest (24.7 mM KCl) did not affect glibenclamide-sensitive twofold activation of rubidium efflux by P-1075 (5 microM) from rubidium-loaded hearts, but eliminated uncoupling produced by P-1075 in beating hearts: 40% depletion of phosphocreatine and ATP, 50% increase in oxygen consumption, and reduction of cytochrome c oxidase. Depolarized cardiac arrest by calcium channel blocker, verapamil (5 microM), also prevented uncoupling. Lack of P-1075 mitochondrial effects in depolarized hearts was not due to changes in phosphorylation potential, because 2,4-dintrophenol (10 microM) reversed the [PCr]/[Cr] increase and Pi decrease, characteristic of KCl-arrest, but did not restore uncoupling. In agreement with this conclusion, pyruvate (5 mM) increased [PCr]/[Cr] and decreased Pi, but did not prevent uncoupling in beating hearts. A decrease in mean [Ca2+] in KCl-arrested hearts could not account for lack of P-1075 mitochondrial effects, because calcium channel opener, S-(-)-Bay K8644 (50 nM), and beta-agonist, isoproterenol (0.5 microM), did not facilitate uncoupling. In contrast, in adenosine (1 mM)-arrested hearts (polarized arrest), P-1075 caused 40% phosphocreatine and ATP depletion. In isolated rat liver mitochondria, P-1075 (20 microM) decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi) by approximately 14 mV (demonstrated by redistribution of DeltaPsi-sensitive dye, rhodamine 800) in a glibenclamide-sensitive manner. We concluded that cell membrane depolarization does not prevent activation of sarcolemmal KATP by P-1075, but it plays a role in mitochondrial uncoupling effects of P-1075.",

In this work, we evaluated the effects of PAF on the formation of sclerotic cells of Fonsecaea pedrosoi, the major causative agent of chromoblastomycosis. Cell differentiation was evaluated by light and electron microscopy, which showed that treatment of mycelial forms with PAF results in the generation of sclerotic bodies with typical morphological characteristics. Biochemical features of PAF-induced sclerotic cells were also analyzed and compared with those from sclerotic forms induced by propranolol, a previously described differentiating agent of F. pedrosoi. Chemical analyses of lipid and carbohydrate components from PAF- or propranolol-induced sclerotic bodies revealed that palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids were the major fatty acid components, while glucose, mannose, galactose and rhamnose were detected as the principal sugar constituents in these cells. Surface carbohydrate components of PAF- and propranolol-induced sclerotic cells were also evaluated, by flow cytometry analysis with twelve different lectins. The profile of reactivity of PAF- or propranolol-induced fungal cells with lectins was also very similar. Hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphate by fungal cells demonstrated that the addition of PAF or propranolol to the mycelial cultures similarly promotes a significant increase in ecto-phosphatase activity. These results indicate that the differentiation of F. pedrosoi mycelial cells induced by PAF generates authentic sclerotic forms, as confirmed by the analysis of morphological and biochemical attributes. Since PAF is synthesized in normal conditions by the human host, these observations may have a correlation with the differentiation of F. pedrosoi in vivo.",

    "123": "Zolmitriptan is a novel and highly selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist used as an acute oral treatment for migraine. There are few reports regarding the in vitro metabolism of zolmitriptan. Previous studies indicated zolmitriptan was metabolized via CYP1A2 in human hepatic microsomes. In order to study the enzyme kinetics and drug interaction, the metabolism of zolmitriptan and possible drug-drug interactions were investigated in rat hepatic microsomes induced with different inducers. An active metabolite, N-demethylzolmitriptan, was detected and another minor, inactive metabolite that was reported in human hepatic microsomes was not detected in this study. The enzyme kinetics for the formation of N-demethylzolmitriptan from zolmitriptan in rat liver microsomes pretreated with BNF were 96+/-22 microM (K(m)), 11+/-3 pmol min(-1)mg protein(-1) (V(max)), and 0.12+/-0.02 microl min(-1)mg protein(-1) (CL(int)). Fluvoxamine and diphenytriazol inhibited zolmitriptan N-demethylase activity catalyzed by CYP1A2 (K(i)=3.8+/-0.3 and 3.2+/-0.1 microM, respectively). Diazepam and propranolol elicited a slight inhibitory effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan (K(i)=70+/-11 and 90+/-18 microM, respectively). Cimetidine and moclobemide produced no significant effect on the metabolism of zolmitriptan. Fluvoxamine yielded a k(inactivation) value of 0.16 min(-1), and K(i) of 57 microM. The results suggest that rat hepatic microsomes are a reasonable model to study the metabolism of zolmitriptan, although there is a difference in the amount of minor, inactive metabolites between human hepatic microsomes and rat liver microsomes. The results of the inhibition experiments provided information for the interactions between zolmitriptan and drugs co-administrated in clinic, and it is helpful to explain the drug-drug interactions of clinical relevance on enzyme level. This study aso demonstrated that fluvoxamine may be a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP1A2.",

Total body fat mass, total body fat-free mass (FFM) and total body water (W) were determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Patients and controls underwent a structured physical training program and a hypocaloric diet for a period of 31.6 +/- 10.6 days. Measured REE in patients taking beta-blockers was 1818 +/- 309 kcal/24 h and 1853 +/- 348 kcal/24 h in patients not taking beta-blockers; p = non significant.

    "130": "Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) using an accessory pathway is the most common supraventricular tachycardia observed in infancy and childhood. There is a general agreement to treat children older than 5 years who are on a potentially long-term antiarrhythmic agent with radiofrequency catheter ablation. Atenolol, a relatively long-acting and cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, has been used to control the various types of supraventricular tachycardia in children and adults. There are few reports on the use of atenolol in children <5 years old with AVRT. This retrospective study reports our experience in 22 children <5 years old (median age, 20 months) who received atenolol monotherapy between 1995 and 2001 for treatment of AVRT. AVRT was confirmed in 17 patients by transvenous or transesophageal electrophysiologic study and in 5 patients by documented preexcitation on electrocardiograms. In nine patients atenolol was the first antiarrhythmic drug given. In 15 of the 22 patients (68%) therapy with atenolol was considered successful. The average effective dose of atenolol in these 15 patients was 1.2 +/- 0.3 mg/kg/day. During a median follow-up of 41 months (8-74 months), atenolol had been discontinued in 10 patients and no further attacks of tachycardia occurred except in 1 patient. In no case did the drug have to be withdrawn for adverse effects. In conclusion, this retrospective study shows that atenolol as a monotherapy is efficient and relatively safe in the long-term treatment of AVRT in young children. Atenolol can be recommended as a first-line treatment option for the management of AVRT in infants and young children.", 
    "131": "Beta-blockers have beneficial effects in heart failure, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. Beta2-adrenoceptors, however, are proportionally higher in the failing human heart. This study shows several clinically used beta-blockers are agonists at the human beta2-adrenoceptor. Although these agonist effects were small at the cAMP level, they were substantial at the level of cAMP response element (CRE)-mediated gene transcription. Some of the effects of \"beta-blockers\" seen in heart failure may be related to the beta2-agonist actions of these compounds. CRE-gene transcription responses to beta2-agonists, forskolin, and cAMP-analogs were sensitive to p42/44-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway inhibitors. p42/44-MAP kinase activation was also shown directly by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. N-[2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline (H89; a protein kinase A inhibitor) stimulated cAMP accumulation and CRE gene transcription via the beta2-adrenoceptor at concentrations at which protein kinase A was inhibited, providing evidence for an alternative pathway. Propranolol, however, produced paradoxical effects; it reduced basal cAMP accumulation (via beta2-mediated inverse agonism) but stimulated beta2-mediated CRE gene transcription. This cannot be explained by a sequential pathway from Gs-adenylyl cyclase-cAMP to CRE binding protein phosphorylation. Both responses to propranolol were insensitive to pertussis toxin, thus excluding Gi-protein involvement. Propranolol CRE gene transcription responses were attenuated by p42/44-MAP kinase inhibitors and propranolol was also found to directly stimulate the p42/44-MAP kinase pathway. Studies of inositol phosphate accumulation and of protein kinase C or Rho kinase inhibitors on CRE-gene transcription provided no evidence for Gq/11 or G12/13 involvement. These data suggest that propranolol can simultaneously act as an inverse agonist through a Gs-coupled mechanism while stimulating the p42/44-MAP kinase pathway through an alternative G-protein-independent mechanism.",

Peaks of incidence occur in the morning, on Mondays, and in winter. There is a difference in the pattern of incidence in different subgroups such as diabetics and smokers, which, along with the incidence alteration seen with aspirin and beta blockers, gives us some potential understanding of underlying mechanisms. Recent advances in the study of endothelial function, cytokine biology, and adhesion molecules have led to new insights into the way that natural fluctuations in these systems may affect ACS incidence. It is hoped that understanding these developments will lead to therapeutic advances in ACS prevention.",

For many patients with atrial fibrillation, a common condition that poses a high risk of stroke, heart rate control with beta-blockers is increasingly seen as a critical therapeutic component. Similarly, perioperative beta-blocker use provides clinical benefits in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who are at risk of cardiac events. In migraine therapy, beta-blockers are well established as effective agents for prophylaxis, and beta-blockers may reduce levels of C-reactive protein, a sensitive marker of inflammation in cardiovascular disease. Reviewing the role of beta-blockers in several ancillary conditions should help illuminate various aspects of the complex progression of cardiovascular disease and clarify the drugs' various therapeutic benefits.",

Management of heart failure has 3 major goals: (1) the specific treatment of the underlying cardiac disease; (2) relief of symptoms and improvement of quality of life; and (3) modification of the long-term neurohormonal progression. From clinical trial data, beta-blockers are recommended in national heart failure management guidelines as part of the standard therapy, along with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and (usually) digoxin. Other agents such as angiotensin II-receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) receptor antagonists may also be important.",

However, beta-blockers are underutilized in managing the general hypertensive population. This phenomenon may stem in part from concerns about side effects. On the contrary, beta-blockers demonstrate comparable efficacy, safety, and tolerability compared with other classes of antihypertensive drugs. Because beta-blockers offer unique cardiovascular protection, they should be considered an integral part of the treatment regimen for patients with hypertension who are at risk for cardiovascular events.", 
    "137": "We examined long-term influence of the angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker irbesartan and the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol on some neurohormonal systems implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, 115 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized to receive double-blind irbesartan or atenolol, with additional therapy if needed. Neurohormone measurements and echocardiography were performed at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48. Left ventricular mass was reduced more by irbesartan than by atenolol (-26 g/m2 versus -14 g/m2, P = 0.024), despite similar reductions in blood pressure. Plasma renin activity and angiotensin II increased (P < 0.001) by irbesartan (0.9 +/- 0.7 to 3.4 +/- 4.2 ng/mL x h, and 3.0 +/- 1.6 to 13.0 +/- 17.7 pmol/L), but decreased (P < 0.01) by atenolol (1.0 +/- 0.6 to 0.7 +/- 0.6 ng/mL x h, and 3.4 +/- 1.6 to 3.2 +/- 2.2 pmol/L). Serum aldosterone decreased (P < 0.05) by both irbesartan (346 +/- 140 to 325 +/- 87 pmol/L) and atenolol (315 +/- 115 to 283 +/- 77 pmol/L). Changes in left ventricular mass by irbesartan related inversely to changes in plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone (all P < 0.05). Plasma levels and 24-hour urinary excretions of catecholamines, plasma leptin, proinsulin, insulin and insulin sensitivity remained largely unchanged in both groups. Thus, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system appears to be an important non-hemodynamic factor in the regulation of left ventricular mass.", 
    "138": "Pulsatile peptide hormone secretion provides efficient control of specific end organ functions. To test the hypothesis that sympathetic neuronal activity drives synchronous pulsatile PTH release from the parathyroid glands, we investigated the acute effects of beta1-adrenergic receptor blockade on PTH secretion patterns in a single-blinded study in nine healthy adults. Plasma PTH levels were determined at 1-min intervals. After a 75-min baseline period, seven subjects received a continuous intravenous infusion of the short-acting beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker esmolol for 105 min. After a 30-min washout period, esmolol was infused for another 30 min. Two additional subjects were randomized to receive solvent infusions. PTH secretion characteristics were analyzed by multiparameter deconvolution analysis, and the orderliness of plasma PTH fluctuations by Approximate Entropy statistics. BP slightly decreased during esmolol infusion, whereas heart rate, ionized calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and plasma and urine catecholamines remained unchanged. Esmolol increased mean plasma PTH by 33 +/- 8% (P < 0.01), due to a preferential increase in the pulsatile PTH secretion component (+129 +/- 44%, P < 0.02). The increased pulsatile PTH secretion was mediated by an augmented PTH burst mass (+117 +/- 42%, P < 0.01), whereas burst frequency remained unchanged. The regularity of PTH fluctuations was not affected by the beta-adrenergic blockade. The effects were reproducible during the second esmolol infusion. The authors conclude that the sympathetic nervous system has a modulating effect on pulsatile PTH secretion. Selective beta-1 adrenergic blockade acutely increases plasma PTH by augmenting the mass of hormone secreted per burst, but it does not alter the rhythmicity of pulsatile PTH release.", 
    "139": "Carvedilol is a combined alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. The ability of carvedilol to antagonize functional effects mediated through myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors has never been investigated. We tested the ability of carvedilol to antagonize the inotropic effect mediated by myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors compared to the antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors. Papillary muscles from rat heart left ventricle were mounted in an organ bath and concentration-response experiments for the inotropic effects of separate alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation were performed in the absence and presence of carvedilol. Carvedilol antagonized myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors with an inhibition constant (K(i)) of 11.0+/-3.0 nmol/l and the functional experiments were supported by radioligand-binding studies. Corresponding functional studies on the response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation revealed a K(i) of 1.2+/-0.35 nmol/l. Thus, carvedilol antagonizes the myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors with a 9-fold lower potency than the beta-adrenoceptors. Antagonism of myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptor evoked effects may contribute to clinical effects of carvedilol.",

Male, Sprague Dawley rats (n=30) underwent either a 30% total body surface area full thickness burn or sham treatment. Twenty-four hours later, animals were anesthetized, underwent laparotomy and the proximal jejunum was cannulated. The jejunal segment was perfused with buffer containing [3H] propranolol. Following euthanasia, jejunal tissue was harvested for Western immunoblotting of P-glycoprotein and villin, and immunohistochemical analysis of P-glycoprotein. Dramatic structural changes in jejunal integrity were observed following thermal injury; however, no significant differences in the absorption characteristics of propranolol following thermal injury were observed. Mean effective permeability of propranolol was 5.67+/-1.79 and 5.85+/-1.67cm/sx10(-5) for burn and sham groups, respectively (P>0.05). P-glycoprotein and villin content in the jejunum were significantly decreased in burn animals. The transcellular transport of propranolol is unaffected 24h following thermal injury in rats, despite alterations in intestinal P-glycoprotein content. The decrease in P-glycoprotein and villin content in thermally injured animals may reflect loss of mature enterocytes at the villus tips.",

A huge amount of money is spent every year treating problems connected with this syndrome. In this paper we analyse randomised prospective trials which support the use of beta-blockers in these patients. We also analyse the benefits of this treatment and some special considerations concerning the use of these drugs.", 
    "143": "Several studies have demonstrated that patients affected by heart failure have a compromised quality of life and, in the last few years, \"health-related quality of life\" has become an important outcome indicator for the evaluation of heart failure treatment and a basis for the improvement of its strategies.",

The KCCQ was compared to the \"Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire\" (MLHF).", 
    "145": "The Italian version of the KCCQ correlates well with the MLHF for all domains with the exclusion of symptom stability score and MLHF emotional domain. However, the KCCQ, due to its multiple domains, provided more detailed information about the patients' status, and identified the more compromised ones.", 
    "146": "The KCCQ appears to be a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of a patient's quality of life and the degree of limitations imposed upon him/her by the disease. When compared to the MLHF, the KCCQ, however, is somewhat more sensitive in identifying more compromised patients. This capacity could be advantageously used for the identification of clinical changes in future trials and lead to a better planning of new therapeutic interventions.", 
    "147": "In the present review striking data showing that intensive care unit patients with acute heart failure and high-risk surgical patients may markedly benefit from the use of levosimendan are presented. Indeed, levosimendan is an effective new agent that acts via two complementary mechanisms. It enhances cardiac contractility by improving the response of the myofilaments to intracellular calcium, and it reduces the cardiac workload by opening the adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium channels for the dilation of blood vessels. Because the therapeutic levels of levosimendan do not increase the intracellular calcium concentrations, levosimendan is less likely than traditional inotropes (beta-agonist inotropes or phosphodiesterase inhibitors) to elicit arrhythmias or impair diastolic relaxation. In fact, the results of recent clinical studies indicate that levosimendan offers significant hemodynamic and survival benefits when given to patients who are hospitalized for acute heart failure. Indeed, in the near future, it is likely that levosimendan may also prove effective for the treatment of patients with diastolic heart failure or for those with a low cardiac output following coronary artery bypass grafting. In addition, levosimendan has the potential of supporting the cardiac function during the initiation of beta-blocker therapy, for weaning patients from cardiopulmonary bypass, for individuals with valvular abnormalities and for those with myocarditis. Preliminary results also suggest that levosimendan may be beneficial for the treatment of patients with right ventricular heart failure. Although the use of levosimendan has been fully validated for the most common causes of acute heart failure, additional clinical trials are needed to safety broaden its therapeutic indications.",

In contrast, ethanol exposure for 48 hr reduced the release of beta-EP but increased the release of nitrite from these cells. Alcohol treatments altered the expression of neuronal NO synthase mRNA, but not inducible NO synthase mRNA, in a pattern similar to that of nitrite levels. Alcohol treatments blocked sodium nitroprusside-induced increases in the level of cellular cyclic guanidine monophosphate. The nonspecific NO blocker NG-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-esther, but not the inactive isomer N-nitro-d-arginine-methyl-esther (d-NAME), inhibited ethanol inhibitory actions on beta-EP release.",

Mean maximal relaxation responses of BRL37344 and salbutamol relative to maximal isoproterenol responses were 89.8% and 76.7%, respectively. Propranolol (10 to 100 nM) in 18 animals antagonized CRCs to isoproterenol with high affinity (apparent pKB 8.6) but the Schild plot had a slope that was significantly less than unity (0.68, p <0.01). High concentrations of the beta1-antagonist CGP20712A (3 to 30 microM) in 12 animals had no effect on responses to isoproterenol. The beta2-antagonist ICI118551 (30 to 300 nM) in 25 animals antagonized responses to isoproterenol with high affinity (apparent pKB 8.03) with a Schild slope not different from unity (0.79). The beta3-antagonist SR59230A (10 to 100 nM) in 12 animals antagonized CRCs to isoproterenol with an apparent pKB of 7 and with a Schild slope that was again significantly less than unity (0.62, p <0.01), indicating that responses to isoproterenol are mediated by more than 1 beta-adrenoceptor subtype. According to the Schild plot of unity ICI118551 (3 to 30 nM) in 18 animals competitively antagonized responses to salbutamol with high affinity (pA2 8.5).",

    "157": "Sibutramine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, used in the treatment of obesity. In this study, cardiovascular effects of sibutramine (0.9, 3, or 9 mg kg(-1) i.p.) were measured in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats, in the absence and presence of beta- and/or alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism (with propranolol and/or phentolamine, respectively). Sibutramine caused pressor and tachycardic effects, with celiac and mesenteric vasoconstrictions, and hyperemic hindquarters vasodilatation. Pretreatment with propranolol inhibited the tachycardic and hindquarters vasodilator effect of sibutramine, whereas phentolamine inhibited the pressor and vasoconstrictor effects of sibutramine. In the presence of phentolamine, sibutramine caused hyperemic mesenteric vasodilatation. In preconstricted, isolated, mesenteric vessels, sibutramine and its metabolites BTS 54505 (N-desmethylsibutramine) and BTS 54354 (N-didesmethylsibutramine) (10 microM) produced significant vasodilations. Neither sibutramine nor BTS 54505 enhanced vessel sensitivity to norepinephrine, whereas BTS 54 354 produced a significant leftward shift in the concentration-response curve to norepinephrine. Collectively, the results indicate that the overt cardiovascular effects of sibutramine involve alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated celiac and mesenteric vasoconstrictions, and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated hindquarters vasodilatation and tachycardia. The mesenteric vasodilator response to sibutramine, seen in the presence of phentolamine, may be a direct effect of the drug and/or its metabolites, on vessel tone. The cardiovascular effects of sibutramine in vivo may be secondary to inhibition of peripheral and/or central reuptake of monoamines by the metabolites BTS 54354 and/or BTS 54505. It remains to explain why BTS 54354, but not BTS 54505, enhanced norepinephrine sensitivity in vitro, because both metabolites are potent inhibitors of the norepinephrine transporter.", 
    "158": "There is controversy regarding the optimal technique for maintaining hemodynamic stability during anesthesia. We designed this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to test the hypothesis that the technique used for maintaining hemodynamic stability during general anesthesia can influence recovery after ambulatory surgery. Forty-five healthy consenting women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy procedures were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group 1 (control, n = 15) received normal saline 5 mL and 1 mL, followed by a saline infusion at a rate of 0.005 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1); Group 2 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and saline 1 mL, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); and Group 3 (n = 15) received esmolol 50 mg and nicardipine 1 mg, followed by an esmolol infusion 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). The study drugs were administered after the induction of anesthesia with fentanyl 1.5 microg/kg, and propofol 2 mg/kg I.V. Tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg I.V. Anesthesia was initially maintained with desflurane 2% end-tidal and N(2)O 67% in oxygen in all 3 groups. During surgery, the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained within +/-15% of the baseline value by varying the study drug infusion rate and the inspired concentration of desflurane. In addition to MAP and heart rate values, electroencephalogram bispectral index values were recorded throughout the perioperative period. Recovery times and postoperative side effects were assessed. Compared with the control group, adjunctive use of esmolol and nicardipine attenuated the increase in heart rate (in Group 2) and MAP (in Group 3) after tracheal intubation. Furthermore, the use of an esmolol infusion as an adjunct to desflurane to control the acute autonomic responses during the maintenance period significantly decreased emergence times (4 +/- 2 versus 7 +/- 4 min), decreased the need for postoperative opioid analgesics (43% versus 80%), and reduced the time to discharge (209 +/- 89 versus 269 +/- 100 min). We conclude that the adjunctive use of esmolol alone or in combination with nicardipine during the induction of anesthesia reduced the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Furthermore, use of an esmolol infusion as an adjuvant to desflurane-N(2)O anesthesia for controlling the acute hemodynamic responses during the maintenance period improved the recovery profile after outpatient laparoscopic surgery.", 
    "159": "The adjunctive use of the beta-adrenergic blocker esmolol to control the acute sympathetic responses during desflurane-based anesthesia provided a more rapid awakening from anesthesia, reduced the postoperative opioid analgesic requirement, and decreased the time to discharge home after ambulatory laparoscopic surgery.",

This, combined with the aging of the US population, is creating an increase in the number of older adults eligible for secondary prevention. In 2002, the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement on the benefits of specific secondary prevention risk factor interventions in older adults.

Fifteen microl TG-timolol were instilled into one eye of each subject and the same volume of aqueous, timolol ophthalmic solution was instilled in the fellow eye, in a masked fashion. Tear meniscus curvature was monitored at the center of the lower meniscus in each eye, using a newly-developed video meniscometer, before and at one-minute intervals for ten minutes after, the instillation.

    "174": "This investigation used primary cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells to examine angiotensin II (Ang II) regulation of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (Na(+) pump) activity, and Na(+) pump alpha(1)- and beta(1)-subunit gene transcription. This regulation was mediated through both phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42/44(MAPK)) signaling pathways. Both acute (10 min) and prolonged (24 h) treatment with Ang II stimulated Na(+) pump activity. Also, prolonged exposure to Ang II (24 h) increased promoter transcription of the Na(+) pump alpha(1)- and beta(1)-subunits. Furthermore, PI3K activities because well because p42/44(MAPK) phosphorylation were increased within 10 min after Ang II treatment. To determine whether these stimulatory activities of Ang II are acting through Ang II receptors 1 and/or 2 (AT(1), AT(2)), cells were pretreated with either AT(1) receptor blocker losartan or the AT(2) receptor blocker PD 123,319. Indeed, these treatments prevented the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Na(+) pump activity at both acute and 24-h time points. Furthermore, the Ang II-stimulated alpha(1)-subunit promoter transcription was inhibited by losartan but not by the AT(2) receptor blocker. These results indicate that Ang II acts through both the AT(1) and AT(2) receptor to up-regulate Na(+) pump activity; however, Ang II regulates alpha(1)-gene transcription through AT(1) but not AT(2) receptors. It was also observed that the Ang II-stimulated beta(1)-subunit gene transcription is not mediated through either AT(1) or AT(2) receptors. To examine whether the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger is involved in Ang II-stimulated Na(+) pump activity, cells were pretreated with amiloride, a specific inhibitor of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. This pretreatment prevented 24 h, but not acute, Ang II-stimulated Na(+) pump activity. The 24-h Ang II-stimulated alpha(1)-subunit promoter transcription was also inhibited by amiloride. This suggests that the prolonged effect of Ang II on Na(+) pump activity is dependent on increased Na(+)/H(+) exchange. Because Ang II treatment for 10 min increased PI3K activity because well because p42/44(MAPK) phosphorylation, studies were performed to determine the involvement of PI3K and p42/44(MAPK) signaling pathways in both Ang II-stimulated Na(+) pump activity and alpha(1)- and beta(1)-gene transcription. Cells were pretreated with either the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin or the p42/44(MAPK) inhibitor PD 98059. Ang II-stimulated PI3K or p42/44(MAPK) activity was inhibited by these pretreatments. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY29404 or the MAPK inhibitors U0126 and PD 98059 were all observed to inhibit Ang II-stimulated Na(+) pump activity. To more specifically determine the role of PI3K in Ang II-regulation of alpha(1)-and beta(1)-gene transcription, cells were cotransfected with a dominant-negative p85 construct. Cotransfection with dominant-negative p85 reduced Ang II-stimulated alpha(1)-but not beta(1)-gene transcription in vascular smooth muscle cells. These results indicate that Ang II acts through PI3K/p42/44(MAPK) signaling pathways to up-regulate Na(+) pump activity and alpha(1)-gene transcription and that Ang II-regulated beta(1)-gene transcription is not mediated through either PI3K or p42/44 (MAPK) signaling pathways."
