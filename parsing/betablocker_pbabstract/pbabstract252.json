The best compound, which was the benzodioxole dicarboxylate derivative, showed potent beta3-adrenergic agonistic activities in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the bovine beta3-adrenoceptors with Kact and Ki values better than compound CL 316,243 used as reference (14 +/- 6 nM and 203 +/- 71 nM, respectively). In this series three compounds showed an antagonistic activity. Structure-activity relationships in these ketone oxime ethers are discussed.", 
    "1": "The cardioprotective effects of carvedilol (CV) may be explained in part by interactions with heart mitochondria. The objective of this work was to study the protection afforded by CV against oxidative stress induced in isolated heart mitochondria by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase (HX/XO), a well-known source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cardiovascular system.", 
    "2": "Mitochondria were isolated from Wistar rat hearts (n = 8) and incubated with HX/XO in the presence and in the absence of calcium. Several methods were used to assess the protection afforded by CV: evaluation of mitochondrial volume changes (by measuring changes in the optical density of the mitochondrial suspension), calcium uptake and release (with a fluorescent probe, Calcium Green 5-N) and mitochondrial respiration (with a Clark-type oxygen electrode).", 
    "3": "CV decreased mitochondrial damage associated with ROS production by HX and XO, as verified by the reduction of mitochondrial swelling and increase in mitochondrial calcium uptake. In the presence of HX and XO, CV also ameliorated mitochondrial respiration in the active phosphorylation state and prevented decrease in the respiratory control ratio (p < 0.05) and in mitochondrial phosphorylative efficiency (p < 0.001).", 
    "4": "The data indicate that CV partly protected heart mitochondria from oxidative damage induced by HX and XO, which may be useful during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. It is also suggested that mitochondria may be a priority target for the protective action of some compounds.", 
    "5": "It appears to be confirmed by international studies that the development of end-stage nephropathy, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity can be reduced to a large extent by achieving a target blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg in diabetes hypertension and 125/75 mmHg in diabetic nephropathy. Diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists are all recommended agents with evidence \"A\" according to both international and national recommendations. The most efficient nephroprotection and simultaneous intensive and efficient blood pressure reduction can be achieved by ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers as basic agents. It is often required to use combination treatment to achieve the target blood pressure. In the predialysis stage, tight blood pressure control should be completed with balanced glucose metabolism, restricted protein intake, controlled salt and water metabolism, early treatment of metabolic acidosis and preparation for kidney substitution treatment. The patient and the treating physicians should work together in a coordinated way during the complex nephrology, diabetes, cardiology care to slow down the progress of the disease.", 
    "6": "This study was designed to define the effect of low-dose aspirin administration on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in normal human subjects.", 
    "7": "Aspirin, 50 mg daily, was given for 14 days to 18 nonsmoking healthy male volunteers. A modified 5-drug cocktail procedure consisting of caffeine, mephenytoin, metoprolol, chlorzoxazone, and midazolam was performed to simultaneously assess in vivo activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A, respectively. The activities were assessed on 4 occasions including at baseline, after 7 and 14 daily doses of aspirin, and at 7 days after discontinuation of aspirin. Concentrations of parent drugs and corresponding metabolites in biologic samples were assayed by reversed-phase HPLC.", 
    "8": "Both 7-day and 14-day aspirin intake increased the activity of CYP2C19 significantly, as indicated by 4-hydroxymephenytoin urinary recovery (P <.001). Induction of low-dose aspirin on CYP2C19 was time-dependent. CYP3A activity indices increased moderately but significantly by both 7-day and 14-day aspirin treatment (P <.05), but the percentage changes in CYP3A activity indices were not significant. Low-dose aspirin had no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 in vivo activity by either 7-day or 14-day treatment.", 
    "9": "The effect of low-dose aspirin on CYPs was enzyme-specific. Both 7-day and 14-day low-dose aspirin induced the in vivo activities of CYP2C19 but did not affect the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1. The effect of low-dose aspirin on CYP3A activity awaits further confirmation. When low-dose aspirin is used in combination with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C19, doses of the latter should be adjusted to ensure their efficacy.", 
    "10": "Our objective was to evaluate the effects of itraconazole and grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetics of the beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent celiprolol in healthy volunteers.", 
    "11": "In a randomized 3-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers took itraconazole 200 mg orally or placebo twice a day or 200 mL grapefruit juice 3 times a day for 2 days. On the morning of day 3, 1 hour after ingestion of itraconazole, placebo, or grapefruit juice, each subject ingested 100 mg celiprolol with 200 mL of water (placebo and itraconazole phases) or grapefruit juice. In addition, 200 mL of water or grapefruit juice was ingested 4 and 10 hours after celiprolol intake. The plasma concentrations of celiprolol, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole and the excretion of celiprolol into urine were measured up to 33 hours after dosing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were recorded with subjects in a sitting position before the administration of celiprolol and 2, 4, 6, and 10 hours later.", 
    "12": "During the itraconazole phase, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 33 hours [AUC(0-33)] of celiprolol was 80% greater (P <.05) than in the placebo phase. During the grapefruit juice phase, the mean AUC(0-33) and peak plasma concentration values of celiprolol were reduced to about 13% (P <.001) and 5% (P <.001) of the respective placebo phase values. The cumulative excretion into urine of celiprolol was increased by 59% by itraconazole (P <.05) and decreased by 85% by grapefruit juice (P <.001). Hemodynamic variables did not differ between the phases.", 
    "13": "Itraconazole almost doubles but grapefruit juice greatly reduces plasma concentrations of celiprolol. The itraconazole-celiprolol interaction most likely resulted from increased absorption of celiprolol possibly as a result of P-glycoprotein inhibition in the intestine. The reduced celiprolol concentrations during the grapefruit juice phase were probably caused by physicochemical factors that interfered with celiprolol absorption, although other mechanisms cannot be excluded. The grapefruit juice-celiprolol interaction is probably of clinical relevance.", 
    "14": "Salivary secretion of immunoglobulin A (lgA) by submandibular glands is increased by stimuli from autonomic nerves. Since it is unclear which specific autonomic receptors transduce such stimuli, we have infused autonomimetics intravenously and compared secretion of fluid, IgA and stored proteins (peroxidase and total protein) with secretory responses during electrical stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve supply in anaesthetized rats. The greatest secretion of IgA was evoked by the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine and this was reduced by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug propranolol. The secretion of fluid or proteins but not IgA was increased with frequency of nerve stimulation and dose of methacholine (cholinergic), isoprenaline (beta-adrenergic) or phenylephrine (alpha-adrenergic).", 
    "15": "Placebo-activated endogenous opioids act on pain mechanisms inducing analgesia, as well as on the respiratory centers inducing respiratory depression. Here, we show that placebo analgesia is accompanied by a reduced beta-adrenergic activity of the heart. We measured heart rate during placebo-induced expectation of analgesia, both in the clinical and the laboratory setting. In the clinical setting, we found that the placebo analgesic response to an electrical noxious stimulus was accompanied by a reduced heart rate response. In order to investigate this effect from a pharmacological viewpoint, we reproduced the same effect in the laboratory setting by using experimental ischemic arm pain. We found that the opioid antagonist naloxone completely antagonized both placebo analgesia and the concomitant reduced heart rate response, whereas the beta-blocker propranolol antagonized the placebo heart rate reduction, but not placebo analgesia. By contrast, both placebo responses were present during muscarinic blockade with atropine, indicating no involvement of the parasympathetic system. In order to better understand the effects of naloxone and propranolol, we performed a spectral analysis of the heart rate variability for the identification of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components, and found that the beta-adrenergic low frequency (0.15 Hz) spectral component was reduced during placebo analgesia, an effect that was reversed by naloxone. These findings indicate that placebo analgesia is accompanied by a complex cascade of events which affect the cardiovascular system.", 
    "16": "Cocaine evokes pressor responses due either to a large increase in systemic vascular resistance despite a decrease (>8%) in cardiac output (vascular responders) or to small increases in both cardiac output and vascular resistance (mixed responders) in conscious rats. These studies were designed to determine (1) if the hemodynamic response pattern to cocaine correlates with relative sensitivity to toxicity and (2) if altering the hemodynamic response pattern to cocaine using propranolol enhances toxicity. Rats were instrumented for determination of cardiac output and arterial pressure. After recovery, rats were classified as vascular or mixed responders to cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.v., four to six trials). Two weeks later, cocaine was infused (1.5 mg/kg/min) until death after pretreatment with saline or propranolol (1 mg/kg). Saline-pretreated mixed responders (n=6) had greater tolerance to cocaine toxicity compared to vascular responders (n=11). Furthermore, saline-pretreated vascular responders were less sensitive than propranolol-pretreated vascular responders (n=9) to cocaine toxicity. Therefore, we propose that the initial hemodynamic response pattern to cocaine predicts sensitivity to cocaine toxicity. In addition, propranolol, a drug that enhances the increase in vascular resistance to cocaine, also increases toxicity to cocaine in vascular responders.", 
    "17": "A previous receptor binding assay indicated that baicalein, one of the active principles of the Chinese herbal drug, Huangqin (Scutellariae Radix), interacts with the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors in mouse cortex membrane preparations with a K(i) value of 13.1 microM. Therefore, the present study examined whether baicalein and its 7-glucuronide, baicalin, have anxiolytic-like effects in a Vogel conflict test adapted for ICR mice. The results showed that both baicalein (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and baicalin (20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased the number of shocks accepted in the Vogel lick-shock conflict paradigm over 9 min, as did a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Since the total volume of water intake and the shock sensitivity of mice were not significantly changed after drug treatment, the effect of baicalein or baicalin was not due to an enhancement of thirst or shock tolerance. Furthermore, this anxiolytic-like effect of baicalein or baicalin was antagonized by co-administration with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (2 mg/kg, i.p.), but not with a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, pindolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.). It is concluded that the anxiolytic-like effect of baicalein or baicalin may be mediated through activation of the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "18": "Catecholamines are elaborated in stress responses to mediate vasoconstriction, and elevate systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. They are elaborated in disorders such as sepsis, cocaine abuse, and cardiovascular disease. The aim of the study was to determine whether catecholamines affect nitric oxide (NO) production, as NO is a vasodilator and counteracts the harmful effects of catecholamines. RAW264.7 macrophage cells were cultured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)+/-epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine at 5x10(-6)M concentrations for 24h. Supernatants were harvested for measuring NO by spectrophotometry using the Greiss reagent and cells were harvested for detecting inducible NO synthase (iNOS) by Western blot. NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages was increased significantly by addition of LPS (0.5-10ng/ml) in a dose-dependent fashion. The NO production induced by LPS was further enhanced by epinephrine and norepinephrine, and to a lesser extent by dopamine. These increases in NO correlated with expression of iNOS protein in these cells. The enhancing effect of iNOS synthesis by epinephrine and norepinephrine on LPS-induced macrophages was down regulated by beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, and dexamethasone. The results suggest that catecholamines have a synergic effect on LPS in induction of iNOS synthesis and NO production, and this may mediate some of the vascular effects of infection. These data support a novel role for catecholamines in disorders such as septic shock and cocaine use, and indicate that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and glucocorticoids may be used therapeutically for modulation of the catecholamine-NO axis in disease states.", 
    "19": "Various cardiovascular drugs have been shown to have neuropsychiatric effects that can be harmful or therapeutically beneficial to patients. As an example, both sedation and mental depression have been described in patients receiving centrally acting antihypertensive drugs and beta-adrenergic blockers, related to their antiadrenergic actions. In contrast, because of these antiadrenergic actions, agents like clonidine have been used to treat opiate, alcohol, and nicotine withdrawal, while beta blockers have been used to treat symptoms of performance anxiety, migraine, and psychocardiac disorders. Some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression. The calcium-channel blocker verapamil has been used as an adjunctive treatment in patients with bipolar disorders. Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are seen in patients with cardiovascular disease, clinicians should be aware of the possible relationship between these symptoms and concurrent cardiovascular drug therapy.",

    "21": "Norepinephrine (NE) is involved in many cardiovascular diseases such as congestive heart failure. We have recently reported that NE had a comitogenic effect in isolated cardiac fibroblasts, and that it activated p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). This study was designed to characterize a possible mechanism involved in the proliferative effect of NE. Isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts were exposed to NE (10 microM) for up to 8 h, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression was measured by Ribonuclease Protection Assay and Western blotting. The activity of p42/p44MAPK was analyzed by Western blotting. Cell number was assessed by use of a Coulter Counter. IL-6/GAPDH mRNA was increased by NE in a time-dependent manner reaching 23 fold stimulation after 1 h compared to untreated samples. Immunoreactivity to IL-6 was not found in controls. After 16 h of exposure to NE, IL-6 protein was detected. It further increased up to 48 h. The effect of NE on IL-6 mRNA was abolished by the beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol, metoprolol (beta1) and ICI 118.551 (beta2), but not by the alpha-adrenoceptor blockers prazosin (alpha1) and yohimbine (alpha2). The MAPK-inhibitor PD98059 suppressed the NE-induced MAPK activation in a concentration-dependent fashion after 5 min, attenuated the NE-induced IL-6 expression after 2 h, and suppressed the proliferative effect of NE from 53 to 18% after 48 h. Recombinant IL-6 caused an increase in proliferation by 31% after 48 h. Simultaneous application of the IL-6 antibody reduced the NE-induced proliferation to 34%, and completely prevented the IL-6 induced effect. These results suggest that NE induces proliferation of rat cardiac fibroblasts in part by increasing the expression of IL-6 through regulation of MAPK.", 
    "22": "Cultured myocyte transplantation into an infarcted myocardium has been shown to improve contractile function. Cryopreservation of cultured muscle cells or heart tissue will be important for the technology to be practical. This study, using fetal cardiomyocytes, evaluated the optimal conditions for muscle cell cryopreservation. Study 1: Fetal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured. The freshly isolated and passage 1, 2, 3 and 4 cells were cryopreserved in a solution containing 70% IMDM, 20% FBS and 10% DMSO and stored in -196 degrees C for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. The cells were thawed and cultured. Cell number and contractility were evaluated at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 days of culture. Study 2: Rat myocardium was cryopreserved in sizes of 0.2, 2 and 6 mm3 for 1 week. The tissue was thawed and cells were isolated. Cell growth and contractility were evaluated. (1) Cardiomyocytes grew and contracted after cryopreservation. Storage time did not affect cell survival rate, beating cell numbers and beating rates. Increasing cell passage prior to cryopreservation decreased the percentage of beating cells. (2) Cells isolated from cryopreserved tissue grew in vitro and contracted normally. Cell yield decreased with increased cryopreserved tissue size. Fetal rat cardiomyocytes survived and functioned after in vitro cryopreservation. Viable cells can be isolated from cryopreserved myocardium and cultured. Cryopreservation of small pieces of myocardium is preferred for maximal cell yields.",

RT-PCR analysis and pharmacological studies demonstrated that these cells express predominantly the beta(2)-AR subtype coupled to activation of adenylyl cyclase and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Proliferation was determined by cell counting over a 6-day period in medium containing 2.5% fetal calf serum (control) or supplemented with the non-selective beta-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO). ISO induced a concentration-dependent increase in cardiac fibroblast proliferation, which was maximal at 1 micromol/l. This increased proliferation was inhibited by the beta(2)-AR-selective antagonist ICI-118,551, but not the beta(1)-AR-selective antagonist atenolol. Direct activation of adenylyl cyclase alone (0.1-10 micromol/l forskolin) stimulated cyclic AMP production and MAPK activation, but did not induce cell proliferation. Since catecholamines are not considered to be 'classical' growth factors, we subsequently investigated whether beta(2)-AR stimulation results in secretion of growth factors that are able to stimulate proliferation in an autocrine manner. Conditioned medium obtained from cardiac fibroblasts treated with ISO for 48 h increased proliferation of parallel cultures of fibroblasts in the presence of the beta-AR antagonist alprenolol. Heat-treatment of this conditioned medium fully prevented the increase in cell proliferation, indicating that the autocrine factor(s) are heat-sensitive proteins.",

Block measured at the maximum peak of tail currents recorded at -60 mV was similar for propafenone (78.3+/-2.0%, n=7, P>0.05) and higher for 5-hydroxypropafenone (79.3+/-1.5%, n=7, P<0.05). Propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone shifted the midpoint of the activation curve by -10.2+/-0.9 mV (n=7, P<0.01) and -7.4+/-1.1 mV (n=10, P<0.01), respectively. Both drugs accelerated the deactivation and the inactivation process of HERG current.

    "37": "Changes in the volume of rat alveolar type II cells (AT-II cells) induced by terbutaline, a beta(2)-agonist, were measured using video-enhanced contrast microscopy. The changes consisted of three phases: initial cell shrinkage, cell swelling, and gradual cell shrinkage. The initial cell shrinkage was Ca(2+)-dependent and was inhibited by quinine (a K+ channel blocker). The subsequent cell swelling was cAMP-dependent and was inhibited by amiloride (a Na+ channel blocker). The final cell shrinkage was cAMP-dependent and was inhibited by 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB, a Cl- channel blocker). Thus, terbutaline-induced cell volume changes were regulated by both Ca2+ and cAMP. Accumulation of cAMP alone, however, induced the Ca2+ -dependent cell shrinkage of AT-II cells and H-89 (a PKA inhibitor) inhibited terbutaline-induced cell volume changes. This suggests that cAMP accumulation stimulates the Ca2+ signal during terbutaline stimulation. In conclusion, terbutaline stimulates not only Na+ influx, but also K+ and Cl- release mediated via cAMP accumulation in rat AT-II cells, which induces the triphasic cell volume changes.", 
    "38": "There is some evidence that the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in the development and/or maintenance of painful states, and that sympathetic nervous function is altered in these conditions. Our previous experiments showed that electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic trunk (sympathetic stimulation: SS), which normally induces a decrease in blood flow (BF) of plantar skin, induced its BF increase in about 50% of adjuvant-inflamed rats. To investigate the mechanism of this BF-increase response, we examined whether noradrenaline (NA) plays any role in this changed response to SS, and which receptor subtype is involved. We measured paw cutaneous BF response with a laser Doppler flowmeter in rats chronically inflamed with complete Freund's adjuvant. SS induced the BF-increase response in 50-67% of measured sites. Close-arterially injected NA induced the BF-increase response at dosages between 10-100 ng/kg only at the sites with the BF-increase response to SS. The BF-increase and -decrease responses to NA was significantly reduced after the close-arterial injection of either alpha1- or alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists (p lt; 0.05, respectively). In contrast, although the BF-decrease responses to SS were significantly reduced by administration of alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, BF-increase response was reduced only by alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and that only at a higher dose. In addition, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist had no effects on both responses. These results suggest that the BF-increase response to SS involves, additionally to NA, a non-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "39": "Syncope is defined as a self-limited loss of consciousness, usually combined with falling due to the inability to maintain postural tone. The underlying mechanism is a transient global cerebral hypoperfusion. The aetiology essentially includes cardiac disorders (structured heart disease or arrhythmias), neurally-mediated reflex syndromes, orthostatic hypotension and carotid sinus syndrome. History and physical examination will lead to the diagnosis in up to 50%. The most important step is to differentiate patients with heart disease from others, since the mortality of these patients is doubled. Echocardiography, Holter-monitoring and electrophysiological study are useful to approach this population. In patients with suspected neurally-mediated syncope (vasovagal syncope) tilt testing is indicated. Treatment depends on the aetiology. The diagnostic work-up and the therapeutic approach of patients with syncope are outlined. For patients with vasovagal syncope conventional therapeutic strategies include an increased salt/fluid intake, moderate exercise training, tilt-sleeping or tilt-training. Beta-blockers failed to show efficacy in a number of randomised trials. Recently, pacemaker implantation in selected patients with recurrent vasovagal syncopical episodes showed a significant increase in syncope-free survival, compared to no therapy and compared to beta-blocker therapy. In contrast to the increased mortality risk for patients with cardiac syncope, patients with vasovagal syncope have a benign prognosis.", 
    "40": "The facial vein isolated from various species relaxes in response to electrical field stimulation (EFS). EFS-elicited relaxation of the facial vein is mediated through the release of noradrenaline (NA) from sympathetic nerve endings and the subsequent activation of smooth muscle beta-adrenoceptors. The release of NA from sympathetic nerve endings in arterial tissues requires transmembrane Ca2+ influx, mediated predominantly by voltage-gated N-type Ca2+ channels. The present pharmaco-mechanical study was undertaken to determine whether the N-type channel is the exclusive pre-junctional Ca2+ channel mediating NA release from sympathetic nerve endings in the rabbit facial vein. Possible roles of K+ channels in the sympathetic neurotransmission were also examined, especially focusing on the contribution of voltage-dependent, Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels. An isolated ring preparation of the rabbit facial vein exhibited intrinsic myogenic tone which lasted for several hours when stretched. EFS produced frequency-dependent (0.25-2 Hz) relaxation in this preparation. EFS-elicited relaxation was abolished by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM), guanethidine (5 microM) or propranolol (1 microM), indicating that NA released from sympathetic nerve endings was mediating the relaxant response. NA-mediated neurogenic relaxation was almost eliminated by omega-conotoxin-GVIA (1 microM), an N-type Ca2+ channel blocker. On the other hand, tetraethylammonium (TEA, 2 mM) strongly potentiated EFS-elicited relaxation without affecting the relaxation induced by exogenously applied NA. This potentiation by TEA was not profoundly diminished by omega-conotoxin-GVIA (1 microM) alone or omega-conotoxin-GVIA (1 microM) plus omega-agatoxin IVA (10 nM, P-type channel blocker), but was almost abolished by omega-conotoxin-GVIA (1 microM) plus omega-agatoxin IVA (10 nM) plus omega-conotoxin-MVIIC (3 microM, N-, P- and Q-type channel blocker). The potentiating effect of TEA was not mimicked by iberiotoxin (100 nM) or charybdotoxin (3 microM), both of which block BKCa channels. These findings suggest that pre-junctional N-type Ca2+ channels play the predominant role in the sympathetic nerve transmission in the rabbit facial vein, as in peripheral arterial vascular beds. In addition, Ca2+ channels resistant to 1 microM omega-conotoxin-GVIA, most probably Q-type channels, appear to be present at the sympathetic nerve endings in the rabbit facial vein and contribute substantially to the regulation of NA release from the nerve endings. Prejunctional K+ channels, sensitive to TEA but pharmacologically distinct from iberiotoxin-sensitive BKCa channels, seem to be functionally coupled intimately with the omega-conotoxin-GVIA-resistant Ca2+ channels, and thus function as a negative feedback element in sympathetic neurotransmission in the rabbit facial vein.", 
    "41": "This study examines the role of a central pathway involving glutamate receptors, nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP in the acute inhibitory effects of central interleukin 1beta on pentagastrin-stimulated acid production.The acid-inhibitory effect of central interleukin 1beta was prevented by intracisternal (i.c.) microinjections of interleukin 1beta together with the NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine maleate (MK-801). Intracisternal co-administration of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro- L-arginine methyl esther ( L-NAME) or 1H-[1,2,4]oxazodiolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) blocker, both reversed the hyposecretory effect of central interleukin 1beta. Peripheral administration of endotoxin significantly reduced pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. I.c. pre-treatment with the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, IL-1ra, failed to restore acid secretory responses in these rats. In addition, endotoxin did not modify the levels of endogenous mRNA for IL-1beta in the brainstem. We conclude that central glutamate receptors are involved in the acid inhibitory effect of centrally administered interleukin 1beta. This central pathway involves synthesis of NO, which acts on the enzyme sGC. However, endogenous interleukin 1beta does not seem to be involved in the inhibition of gastric acid secretion elicited by peripheral endotoxin.",

We investigated the effects of stimulation of the propranolol-resistant beta1-adrenoceptor in the human heart. Myocardium from non-failing and failing human hearts were set up to contract at 1 Hz. In right atrium from non-failing hearts in the presence of 200 nM (-)-propranolol, (-)-CGP 12177 caused concentration-dependent increases in contractile force (-logEC50[M] 7.3+/-0.1, E(max) 23+/-1% relative to maximal (-)-isoprenaline stimulation of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors, n=86 patients), shortening of the time to reach peak force (-logEC50[M] 7.4+/-0.1, E(max) 37+/-5%, n=61 patients) and shortening of the time to reach 50% relaxation ( t(50%), -logEC50[M] 7.3+/-0.1, E(max) 33+/-2%, n=61 patients). The potency and maxima of the positive inotropic effects were independent of Ser49Gly- and Gly389Arg-beta1-adrenoceptor polymorphisms but were potentiated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (-logEC50[M] 7.7+/-0.1, E(max) 68+/-6%, n=6 patients, P<0.0001). In the presence of (-)-propranolol and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, the potency (-logEC50[M] 7.4+/-0.1, P=0.0013, n=9 patients) but not the maximal effect of (-)-CGP 12177 was reduced in right atrium from failing hearts, which was associated with 64% and 52% reductions in the densities of low-affinity and high-affinity (-)-[3H]CGP 12177 binding sites. In the presence of (-)-propanolol and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, (-)-CGP 12177 increased atrial cyclic AMP levels and activated cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in right atrium from non-failing hearts. In right ventricle from failing hearts (-)-CGP 12177 increased contractile force (-logEC50[M] 7.4+/-0.1, E(max) 34+/-3%, n=13 patients) and hastened the time to peak force (-logEC50[M] 7.6+/-0.1) and time to reach 50% relaxation (-logEC50[M] 7.4+/-0.1) in the presence of (-)-propranolol and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Our results show that (-)-CGP 12177 increases contractility and hastens relaxation through a cyclic AMP pathway in human myocardium, consistent with mediation through a (-)-propranolol-resistant state of the beta1-adrenoceptor. The reduction in heart failure of atrial inotropic potency of (-)-CGP 12177, as well as of the high-affinity and low-affinity binding sites for (-)-[3H]CGP 12177, is consistent with the beta1-adrenoceptor nature of these sites.", 
    "43": "Aortic intramural hematoma (IMH) is a variant of overt aortic dissection. The predictors of progression of IMH to dissection and rupture are still unknown, and strategies for management are not established.", 
    "44": "A multicenter study was conducted comprising 66 patients with IMH and hospital admission <or=48 hours after onset of initial symptoms. Among these, progression to aortic dissection or rupture occurred in 30 (45%) and death occurred in 13 (20%) patients within 30 days. Late progression was noted in 14 (21%) and death in 11 (17%) patients, yielding a 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival of 76%, 73%, and 43%, respectively. In a set of 9 variables, multivariate analysis identified IMH location in the ascending aorta (type A; P=0.02) and moderately ectatic aortic diameters (49+/-13 mm with progression versus 57+/-16 mm without progression; P=0.03) as independent predictors of early progression. In type A IMH, early mortality was 8% with swift surgery versus 55% without surgery (P=0.004). The risk of late progression of IMH was independently associated with age at index diagnosis (P=0.01) and absence of beta-blocker therapy during follow-up (P=0.03). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed improved 1-year survival of IMH with beta-blocker therapy (95% versus 67% without beta-blockers; P=0.004).", 
    "45": "Regardless of aortic diameter, IMH of the ascending aorta (type A) is at high risk for early progression, and, thus, undelayed surgical repair should be performed. Moreover, oral beta-blocker therapy may improve long-term prognosis of IMH independent of anatomical location.", 
    "46": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay using a chiral stationary phase was developed and validated for the determination of carvedilol enantiomers in human serum and was compared with a previously developed capillary electrophoresis (CE) method. The CE and the HPLC assay were compared by analyzing a series of serum samples containing racemic carvedilol in different concentrations using the two methods. The concentrations obtained by the two assays were not found to be significantly different indicating that CE and HPLC are comparable in terms of reproducibility and precision for the stereoselective analysis of carvedilol in human serum.", 
    "47": "An investigation was conducted on the usage of a single-step extraction procedure involving the retention of a phenylboronate-salbutamol complex on an end-capped C18 solid-phase sorbent to determine the level of salbutamol in human plasma samples. Propranolol, a beta-blocker, was chosen as the internal standard for this assay. In this solid-phase clean-up method, 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.60, was used for conditioning the column as well as washing the endogenous interference. Under the optimal conditions, the recovery of salbutamol from spiked plasma samples was found to be high and reproducible with mean recoveries (n = 3) of more than 90% after elution by using 50% 1 M trifluoroacetic acid in methanol. This sample clean-up step was effectively analyzed under reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection. The method was successfully applied to the routine measurement of salbutamol in human plasma from the bioequivalence study on the different administration route of salbutamol. Quantification of salbutamol was convincingly reported with the correlation of coefficient of 0.9980 for the concentration range from 0 to 1000 ng ml(-1). An adequate precision was achieved with both between- and within-day precisions of less than 10% (n = 6) for 100 and 1000 ng ml(-1) and less than 15% (n = 6) for 10 ng ml(-1).", 
    "48": "We investigated the effects of restraint and footshock stress and norepinephrine treatment on gastric emptying. The gastric emptying was significantly inhibited by restraint stress. beta(3)-adrenergic antagonist canceled the inhibition of gastric emptying caused by restraint stress, while beta(1)-, beta(2)-, alpha(1)-, and alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonists did not affect the inhibition. Norepinephrine treatment also inhibited gastric emptying. The inhibition by norepinephrine treatment was canceled by beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenergic antagonists, but not by alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonists. On the other hand, footshock stress did not affect gastric emptying. These results suggest that beta(3)-adrenoceptors play an important role in the inhibition of gastric emptying caused by restraint stress, while nonspecific beta-adrenoceptors are involved in that caused by norepinephrine treatment.", 
    "49": "In this paper we evaluated the bronchodilator effects of SPFF [2-(4-amino-3-chloro-5-trifluomethyl-phenyl)-2-tert-butylamino-ethanol chloride], a newly synthesized beta(2) adrenergic agonist in guinea pigs and rabbits, in comparison with other beta(2) adrenergic agonists, isoprenaline or salbutamol. We studied in vitro the bronchodilator effects of SPFF and isoprenaline on isolated guinea pig trachea strips with or without the precontraction of bronchocontractors (acetylcholine and histamie). The positive chronotropic effects of SPFF and isoprenaline on isolated guinea pig left atria were also tested in vitro. Potency values (pD(2), pA(2) or ED(50)) were determined from the cumulative concentration-response curves. The results showed that SPFF and isoprenaline dose-dependently relaxed the isolated guinea pig trachea strips and the pD(2) values of both drugs were 7.66+/-0.68 and 8.79+/-0.19, respectively. Moreover, we confirmed that the bronchodilator effect of SPFF was due to the activation of beta(2) adrenoceptor because this effect was easily antagonized by ICI-118551 (pA(2) 8.90+/-0.01), a specific beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist. SPFF also dose-dependently relaxed the isolated guinea pig trachea strip precontraction with acetylcholine or histamine with ED(50) values of 10.2+/-0.7 microM and 550+/-38.2 nM, respectively. Furthermore, the positive chronotropic effect of SPFF on isolated guinea pig left atria (pD(2) 5.41+/-0.38) was much weaker than that of isoprenaline (pD(2) 8.75+/-0.24), which implied that SPFF was more selective to airway beta(2) adrenoceptor than isoprenaline; the beta(1)/beta(2) selectivity assay also showed that SPFF was about 162 times more selective to beta(2) adrenoceptor than isoprenaline. A radioligand binding experiment using guinea pig lung and cardiac ventricle as beta(2) and beta(1) adrenoceptor sources, respectively, also demonstrated that SPFF possesses high affinity (27.3 nM) and selectivity (4.6 fold) to beta(2) adrenoceptors. The protective effects of SPFF and salbutamol on bronchospasm induced by bronchoconstrictor aerosol in guinea pigs in vivo were investigated, and the Konzett and R\u00f6ssler experiment in rabbits in vivo was also carried out. SPFF significantly prolonged the latency time of histamine and acetylcholine induced asphyxiation collapse in guinea pigs: the ED(50) value of SPFF i.g. was 0.32+/-0.05 mg.kg(-1) in this experiment. Meanwhile, the ED(50) values of salbutamol was 2.37+/-0.22, which meant that the bronchorelaxation effect of salbutamol was about 6 times less potent than that of SPFF. The Konzett and R\u00f6ssler experiment performed in anesthetized rabbit showed that intraduodenal administration of SPFF exerted action of longer duration than salbutamol. From the results above we suggested that SPFF was a potent, long-acting bronchodilator with relatively higher beta(2) adrenoceptor selectivity.", 
    "50": "Two simple and accurate spectrophotometric methods for determination of timolol and enalapril maleate are described. The first method is based on chelate formation with palladium(II) chloride in buffered medium. The second method is based on the formation of the colored complex between palladium(II), eosin, and the two cited drugs using methylcellulose as surfactant to increase the solubility and intensity of the formed complexes. Under optimum conditions the complexes showed maximum absorption at 369.4 nm and 362.8 nm for timolol and enalapril maleate, respectively, in the first method and 552.2 and 550.6 nm for the second method. Apparent molar absorptivities were 1.8 x 10(3) and 1.3 x 10(3) and Sandell's sensitivities were 5.9 x 10(-4) and 2.7 x 10(-4) for timolol and enalapril maleate in the first method; in the second method molar absorptivities were 2.8 x 10(4) and 1.1 x 10(4) while Sandell's constants were 9.1 x 10(-3) and 2.3 x 10(-3) for timolol and enalapril maleate. The solutions of the complexes obeyed Beer's law in the concentration ranges 20-200 micro g mL(-1) and 50-300 micro g mL(-1) for timolol and enalapril maleate, respectively. In the second method, because the reaction was more sensitive the ranges were reduced to 1.6-16 micro g mL(-1) for timolol 8-56 micro g mL(-1) for enalapril maleate. The proposed methods were applied to the determination of the two drugs in their pharmaceutical formulation.", 
    "51": "The effect of seven compounds intracellularly applied by spontaneous diffusion were investigated on the EPYLRFamide-induced reduction of acetylcholine-induced inward current (ACh-current) recorded from identified neurones from Helix lucorum. Inward currents were recorded from neurones LPa2, LPa3, RPa3 and RPa2 in isolated ganglia preparations using two-electrode voltage clamp technique. ACh was applied ionophoretically. Heparin, an antagonist of IP(3) receptors (IP(3)Rs), and IP(3), the agonist of IP(3)Rs, decreased the effect of EPYLRFamide. Thio-NADP, a blocker of NAADP-induced Ca(2+) release, beta-NAADP, Ca(2+) releaser, R24571, W-7 (both calmodulin antagonists), and KN-62, a selective inhibitor of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, did not change the modulatory effect of EPYLRFamide. These data suggest that EPYLRFamide decreases ACh-current through elevation of the basal intracellular level of the putative endogenous agonist of IP(3)Rs which activates release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. It is concluded that intracellular free Ca(2+) acts on ACh receptor/ionic channel without activation of calmodulin and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.", 
    "52": "Elective cardiac arrest during surgery can be achieved by inducing depolarization, polarization, or influencing calcium mechanisms. Depolarized arrest, induced by elevating the extracellular potassium concentration, is currently the most commonly used technique. However, injury associated with ionic imbalance involving sodium and calcium overload, together with maintained metabolic processes aimed at correcting these imbalances, have lead to alternatives being sought. \"Polarized\" arrest, induced by sodium-channel blockers or by agents that activate potassium channels, has been shown to exert equal or superior protection. Similarly, agents that induce calcium desensitization may also prove to enhance protection. These alternative techniques, however, require extensive characterization before introduction into routine clinical use can be recommended.", 
    "53": "The prevalence of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and panic disorder (PD) has been reported to range from 0-50% depending on the respective diagnostic manuals and described selection criteria. We report the case of a 44-year-old patient suffering from both panic disorder and mitral valve prolapse. While antidepressants did not result in any improvement of panic symptoms, a fast remission was achieved by treating the patient with metoprolol. This case report suggests that betablockers might represent a useful tool in the treatment of panic disorder and mitral valve prolapse.", 
    "54": "Activation of muscle beta(2)-adrenergic receptors successfully counteracted sarcolemma inexcitability in patients suffering from hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HPP), a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle sodium channel. Looking for potential modulation of these channels by beta(2)-adrenergic pathway using patch-clamp technique, we found that clenbuterol blocked sodium currents (I(Na)) in rat skeletal muscle fibers and in tsA201 cells transfected with the human channel isoform, whereas salbutamol did not. The effects of clenbuterol were independent of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Instead, clenbuterol structure and physicochemical characteristics as well as I(Na) blocking properties resembled those of local anesthetics, suggesting direct binding to the channels. Similar experiments with the chemically similar beta-antagonists propranolol and nadolol, suggested the presence of two hydroxyl groups on the aromatic moiety of the drugs as a molecular requisite for impeding sodium channel block. Importantly, clenbuterol use-dependently inhibited action potential firing in rat skeletal muscle fibers, owing to beta-adrenoceptor-independent I(Na) block. From a clinical point of view, our study defines the rationale for the safe use of salbutamol in HPP patients, whereas clenbuterol may be more indicated in patients suffering from myotonic syndromes, a condition characterized by sarcolemmal overexcitability, because use-dependent I(Na) block can inhibit abnormal runs of action potentials.", 
    "55": "In mammals, the most important synchronizer for endogenous rhythms is the environmental light/dark cycle. In this report we have explored the ability of light/dark cycle and melatonin, the pineal hormone released during the night, to modulate cerebellar cholinergic input by interfering with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors' (nAChRs) availability. Through the analysis of the response to selective cholinergic agonists and antagonists, we observed that nAChRs containing the alpha7 gene product mediate the release of [(3)H]glutamate from rat cerebellum slices. The [(3)H]glutamate overflow induced by alpha7 nAChR activation was higher during the dark phase, although the number of alpha-[(125)I]bungarotoxin binding sites, but not the [(3)H]nicotine binding sites (B(max)), was reduced. On the other hand, glutamate-evoked [(3)H]glutamate release was not modified by the hour of the day. Finally, we show that the nocturnal increase in nicotine-evoked [(3)H]glutamate release is imposed by a nocturnal surge of melatonin, as it is abolished when pineal melatonin production is inhibited by either maintaining the animals in constant light for 48 h or by injecting propranolol just before lights off for 2 days. The difference between light and dark [(3)H]glutamate-evoked release is restored in propranolol-treated animals that received melatonin during the dark period. In conclusion, we show that nicotine-evoked [(3)H]glutamate release in rat cerebellum presents a diurnal variation, driven by nocturnal pineal melatonin surge.", 
    "56": "Brain tryptophan concentrations are increased by various stressful treatments, an effect that can be prevented by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. This study aimed to determine the beta-adrenergic subtype responsible for the tryptophan response. Male CD-1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of nonselective and subtype-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists 20 min before subtype-selective beta-agonists. Selected brain regions were dissected for analysis of tryptophan content by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The beta(2)-selective agonist clenbuterol (0.3 mg/kg) induced increases in brain tryptophan that reached a peak ( approximately 60%) 1 h following injection and small but statistically significant increases ( approximately 20%) in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid: serotonin ratios 2 h following injection. The beta(1)-selective agonist dobutamine (10 mg/kg) produced less robust increases ( approximately 40%) in brain tryptophan, whereas the beta(3)-selective agonists BRL 37344 (0.2 mg/kg (+/-)-(R*,R*)-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino)propyl] phenoxy]acetic acid sodium)) and CL 316243 [0.1 mg/kg disodium 5-[(2R)-2-([(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino)propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate)] resulted in larger increases (80 to 100%). Pretreatment with the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (0.5 mg/kg (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxyl]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol) attenuated the increases in tryptophan induced by both clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg) and dobutamine (10 mg/kg). Pretreatment with the beta(1/2)-selective antagonist propranolol (2.5 mg/kg), the beta(3)-selective antagonist SR 59230A [1.5, 2.5, 5, or 20 mg/kg (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1[1S)-1,2,3,4-tertahydronaphth-1-yl-amino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate)], or ICI 118551 (0.5 mg/kg) did not prevent the BRL 37344-induced increase in brain tryptophan, whereas the beta(1/2/3)-antagonist bupranolol (10 mg/kg) attenuated it. CL 316243 had no effect on brain tryptophan in beta(3)-receptor knockout mice, whereas clenbuterol increased brain tryptophan, indicating that beta-adrenergic modulation of brain tryptophan occurs in the absence of beta(3)-receptors. We conclude that activation of either beta(2)- or beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, but not beta(1)-adrenergic receptors, increases mouse brain tryptophan content.", 
    "57": "The purpose of the present study was to characterize different beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) and determine their role in the spontaneously tonic smooth muscle of the internal anal sphincter (IAS). The beta-AR subtypes in the opossum IAS were investigated by functional in vitro, radioligand binding, Western blot, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies. ZD 7114 [(S)-4-[2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropylaminoethoxy]-N-(2-methoxyethyl)phenoxyacetamide], a selective beta(3)-AR agonist, caused a potent and concentration-dependent relaxation of the IAS smooth muscle that was antagonized by the beta(3)-AR antagonist SR 59230A [1-(2-ethylphenoxy)-3-[[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenyl]amino]-(2S)-2-propanol hydrochloride]. Conversely, the IAS smooth muscle relaxation caused by beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR agonists (xamoterol and procaterol, respectively) was selectively antagonized by their respective antagonists CGP 20712 [(+/-)-2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]phenoxy]propyl]amino]ethoxy]-benzamide methanesulfonate salt] and ICI 118551. Saturation binding of [(125)I]iodocyanopindolol to beta-AR subtypes revealed the presence of a high-affinity site (K(d1) = 96.4 +/- 8.7 pM; B(max1) = 12.5 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg protein) and a low-affinity site (K(d2) = 1.96 +/- 1.7 nM; B(max2) = 58.7 +/- 4.3 fmol/mg protein). Competition binding with selective beta-AR antagonists revealed that the high-affinity site correspond to beta(1)/beta(2)-AR and the low affinity site to beta(3)-AR. Receptor binding data suggest the predominant presence of beta(3)-AR over beta(1)/beta(2)-AR. Western blot studies identified beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-AR subtypes. The presence of beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-ARs was further demonstrated by mRNA analysis using RT-PCR. The studies demonstrate a comprehensive functional and molecular characterization of beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-ARs in IAS smooth muscle. These studies may have important implications in anorectal and other gastrointestinal motility disorders.", 
    "58": "Using an isolated nonworking rat heart model, this study investigated the role of beta-adrenergic preconditioning (beta-PC) to attenuate myocardial dysfunction after an ischemia/reperfusion injury. After a 20-min stabilization period, the noradrenaline depleted hearts were perfused for 5 min with isoproterenol (ISO) before 40-min global ischemia (I) followed by 30-min reperfusion (R). ISO 0.02 microM provided significant protection versus unconditioned in vivo reserpinized IR control, causing a decrease of creatine kinase (CK) release (mIU/min/g wet weight) on reperfusion in coronary effluent, a preservation of the mean coronary flow (MCF) and preservation of left ventricular function assessed by the rate-pressure product (RPP). These beneficial effects were similar to those of ischemic preconditioning (I-PC) in both nonreserpinized and reserpinized rats. Propranolol (1 microM) and atenolol (10 microM) completely suppressed the ISO preconditioning. In contrast, ICI 118551 (2 microM) a highly selective beta -blocker, did not blunt the salutary effects of ISO on CK release and MCF preservation. These results indicate that ISO pretreatment provides a significant cardioprotection against prolonged ischemic myocardial injury. Although endogenous catecholamines are not necessary for I-PC in isolated rat hearts, cardioprotection provided by beta-adrenergic stimulation is quite similar to I-PC. This significant cardioprotection is mediated less by beta -adrenoceptor than by beta -adrenoceptor activation, which seems to play a crucial role in the beta-PC mechanism.",

Two cases of a decrease in LAA blood flow velocity caused by negative inotropic agents are presented as an indication that negative inotropic agents are a risk factor for systemic thromboembolism with AF.", 
    "60": "Sudden cardiac death is a well-documented complication of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and additionally, failure to raise blood pressure (BP) during exercise has been associated with a poor outcome. The present study group comprised 58 patients with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HNCM) who were receiving beta-blocker therapy. All patients underwent submaximal exercise radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG) to evaluate left ventricular (LV) function at both rest and peak exercise. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on the increase in systolic BP during exercise (ie, group A <30% or group N >/=30% of resting systolic BP) and were involved in long-term follow-up (10.4+/-4.0 years). Group A comprised 29% of the subjects. Age and workload at peak exercise were similar in the 2 groups. LV end-diastolic dimension was smaller and the interventricular septum was thicker in group A. LV ejection fraction on RNVG was similar in the 2 groups at rest and at peak exercise. During the follow-up period, more patients in group A than group N suffered syncopal attack (29% vs 5%, p<0.05) and cardiac sudden death (24% vs 2%, p<0.05). Patients with HNCM whose BP fails to rise during exercise have a poor prognosis.", 
    "61": "N-alcohols exert a dual action on neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors with short-chain alcohols exhibiting potentiating action and long-chain alcohols exhibiting inhibitory action. n-Butanol lies at the transition point from potentiation to inhibition. To elucidate the mechanism of dual action of alcohols, the effects of n-butanol on the human alpha4beta2 ACh receptors expressed in the HEK293 cell line were analyzed in detail by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Prolonged applications of n-butanol evoked small currents with an EC(50) value of 230 +/- 90 mM and a Hill coefficient of 1.8 +/- 0.4. This current was blocked by either the ACh channel blocker mecamylamine or the receptor blocker dihydro-beta-erythroidine, indicating that butanol activated receptors as a partial agonist. As expected from its partial agonist action, n-butanol also modulated ACh-induced currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Butanol at 300 mM potentiated currents induced by low concentrations of ACh (</=30 microM), while inhibiting the currents induced by high concentrations of ACh (100-3,000 microM). In addition, butanol at a low concentration (10 mM) suppressed the currents evoked by 10 to 3,000 microM ACh, a result consistent with a channel-blocking action. Most features of n-butanol effects were satisfactorily simulated by a model in which butanol acts as a partial agonist and as a channel blocker.", 
    "62": "Vagal afferent activity modulates mechanical nociceptive threshold and inflammatory mediator-induced hyperalgesia, effects that are mediated by the adrenal medulla. To evaluate the role of epinephrine, the major hormone released from the adrenal medulla, the beta2-adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 was chronically administered to vagotomized rats and epinephrine to normal rats. In vagotomized rats, chronic administration of ICI 118,551 markedly attenuated vagotomy-induced enhancement of bradykinin hyperalgesia but had no effect on nociceptive threshold. In normal rats, chronic epinephrine had the opposite effect, enhancing bradykinin hyperalgesia. Like vagotomy-, epinephrine-induced enhancement of hyperalgesia developed slowly, taking 14 days to reach its peak. Vagotomy induced a chronic elevation in plasma concentrations of epinephrine. We suggest that ongoing activity in vagal afferents inhibits the release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. Chronically elevated levels of epinephrine, occurring after vagotomy, desensitize peripheral beta2-adrenergic receptors and lead to enhancement of bradykinin hyperalgesia. The ability of prolonged elevated plasma levels of epinephrine to sensitize bradykinin receptors could contribute to chronic generalized pain syndromes.",

It also affects peripheral vascular resistance less than propranolol.", 
    "64": "Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-blockade increases the levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), but relationships between this effect and the antihypertensive action of beta-blockade remain unknown. In this study we investigated the amplitude and determinants of bisoprolol-induced ANP increase and the relationships between this increase and the antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol. Nineteen patients with mild to moderate hypertension were included in the study. In the first phase of the study (cross-over, placebo controlled, randomized phase), the effects of 10 mg bisoprolol on plasma ANP at rest and during exercise were compared to placebo. The antihypertensive action of bisoprolol was then evaluated after a 2-week period of treatment (10 mg/day) using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Bisoprolol significantly increased plasma ANP level at rest (from 30.6 +/- 20.5 to 42.8 +/- 35.6; P < 0.05) and also during exercise (from 54.7 +/- 44.3 to 119.1 +/- 159.9; pg/mL +/- SD; P < 0.05). Plasma ANP at rest was not significantly correlated with left ventricular mass. After the 15 days of treatment, the bisoprolol-induced daytime diastolic blood pressure reduction was significantly correlated to the initial bisoprolol-induced plasma ANP increase (r = 0.49, P = 0.035). These results suggest that the antihypertensive effect of beta-blocking agents could be partly mediated by an increase of ANP release.",

METHODS: Enantiomeric separation of racemates of 11 beta-blocking agents and their analogs was performed using chiral stationary phases and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC). RESULTS: These beta -blocker racemates were separated into enantiomers in one or several chormatographic states such as propranolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol, celiprolol, carvedilol, sotalol, propafenone, ephedrine, and zomitriptan. Temperature had a significant effect on the resolution of the drugs when using chiralcel OD. Lower temperatures were associated with higher resolutions. CONCLUSION: When separating beta-blocking agents and their analogs, Chiralcel OD, Chiralpak AD, Chiral stationary phases and GITC chiral derivative reagents have complementary functions.",

Second, iganidipine (0.03%) or betaxolol (0.5%) was unilaterally instilled twice daily for 20 days to study the effects on intravitreously injected various doses of endothelin (ET)-1-induced retinal artery constriction to evaluate whether a pharmacologically active level of the drug penetrated to the posterior retina and to estimate the drug level in the posterior retina (n = 6, respectively). Third, iganidipine (0, 10, or 30 microg/kg: n = 6, 3, and 6, respectively) was intravenously injected to study the effects on intravitreously injected ET-1-induced retinal artery constriction to evaluate iganidipine levels in the posterior retina.

To understand the receptor subtypes responsible for beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of guinea pig taenia caecum, we investigated the effect of fenoterol. Fenoterol caused concentration-dependent relaxation of the guinea pig taenia caecum. Propranolol, bupranolol and butoxamine produced shifts of the concentration-response curve for fenoterol. Schild regression analyses carried out for propranolol, butoxamine and bupranolol against fenoterol gave pA2 values of 8.41, 6.33 and 8.44, respectively. However, in the presence of 3 x 10(-4) M atenolol, 10(-4) M butoxamine and 10(-6) M phentolamine to block the beta1-, beta2- and a-adrenoceptor effects, respectively, Schild regression analysis carried out for bupranolol against fenoterol gave pA2 values of 5.80. These results suggest that the relaxant response to fenoterol in the guinea pig taenia caecum is mediated by both the beta2- and the beta3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "85": "Isoprenaline is known to produce vascular relaxation through activation of beta-adrenoceptors. In recent years, beta-adrenoceptor-activated vascular relaxation has been the focus of pharmacological study in terms of both the receptor subtypes and the intracellular signaling mechanisms which trigger smooth muscle mechanical functions. In addition, the possible contribution of the endothelium to beta-adrenoceptor-activated relaxation of vascular beds has provoked considerable discussion, with consensus still to be established. In the present study, we examined the effects of isoprenaline on isolated mouse aortic smooth muscles to determine whether the presence of the endothelium plays a substantial role in the relaxation it produces. A possible role for nitric oxide (NO) as a primary endothelium-derived factor released in response to isoprenaline was also elucidated pharmaco-mechanically. In isolated thoracic and abdominal aortae pre-contracted with phenylephrine (3 x 10(-7)-10(-6) M), isoprenaline elicited relaxation in a concentration-dependent fashion (10(-9)-10(-5) M). In endothelium-denuded preparations, isoprenaline-elicited relaxation was reduced to 40-50% of the response obtained in endothelium-intact preparations. In the preparations treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 3 x 10(-4) M; an NO synthase inhibitor) or 1H-[1,2,4]-oxadiazolo[4,3-a]-quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 10(-5) M; a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor), isoprenaline-elicited relaxation was attenuated almost to the same degree as the response in endothelium-denuded preparations. The degree of endothelium-dependency in isoprenaline-elicited relaxation was largely diminished when treated with propranolol (3 x 10(-6) M). The present findings indicate that isoprenaline substantially relaxes the mouse aorta with both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The endothelium-dependent component seems to correspond to about 50% of the isoprenaline-elicited relaxation, and is almost entirely due to endothelium-derived NO. Activation of propranolol (3 x 10(-6) M)-inhibitable beta-adrenoceptors seems to be primarily responsible for the NO-mediated endothelium-dependent pathway in isoprenaline-elicited relaxant response of mouse aorta.",

Subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors which mediate catecholamine-elicited relaxations in gastrointestinal smooth muscles are predominantly atypical beta-adrenoceptors including beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Gastrointestinal smooth muscle relaxations mediated via beta(3)-adrenoceptors can occur independently of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) elevation. One of the mechanisms responsible for cyclic AMP-independent smooth muscle relaxation following activation of G(s) protein-coupled receptors could be activation of voltage-gated K(+) channels. In the present study, possible contribution of two types of K(+) (large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive and voltage-gated K(+), BK(Ca); voltage-gated, K(v)) channels to beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated, cyclic AMP-independent relaxations was compared in gastric fundus and duodenum smooth muscles isolated from the guinea-pig. In these gastrointestinal smooth muscles, three catecholamines ((-)-isoprenaline, (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline) and two beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists ((R(*), R(*))-(+/-)-4-[2-[(2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]propyl]phenoxyacetic acid sodium (BRL37344) and (+/-)-[4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy] -1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one] hydrochloride ((+/-)-CGP12177A)) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation in the presence of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists. The relaxations were unaffected by an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ-22536 (100 microM), which indicates their characteristic of cyclic AMP-independency. On the other hand, the SQ-22536-resistant, beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxant components were potently attenuated when the tone was raised using high-KCl (80 mM) or in the presence of a K(v) channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 1-3 mM). Iberiotoxin (100 nM), a selective blocker of BK(Ca) channels which significantly contribute to cyclic AMP-independent vascular smooth muscle relaxations induced through activation of G(s) protein-coupled receptors, did not apparently show any inhibitory effects on SQ-22536-resistant, beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations in these gastrointestinal smooth muscles. The present results indicate that 4-AP-sensitive K(v) channels play a primary role in beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated, cyclic AMP-independent relaxations of guinea-pig gastrointestinal smooth muscles. In these smooth muscles, BK(Ca) channels seem to apparently contribute insignificantly to cyclic AMP-independent relaxations following stimulation of beta(3)-type of adrenoceptors.",

BDPBI with the formula C(27)H(24)BrCl(2)N(3)O was synthesized starting with 3-isochromanone. In the endothelium-containing preparations of the aortic rings, phenylephrine (PHE; 10 micromol/l) elicited contracture and acetylcholine (ACh; 10 micromol/l) or BDPBI (0.01-10 micromol/l) elicited relaxation effects on the PHE-precontracted preparations. The BDPBI-elicited effect on the PHE-precontracted aortic rings was not altered in the presence of adrenergic blockers (propranolol or yohimbine; 1 micromol/l) or pretreated preparations with aspirin, indomethacin (10 micromol/l) or L-NAME (1 mmol/l). However, the relaxation effects of BDPBI were blocked if the preparations were pretreated with diphenhydramine (10 micromol/l) or chloropheniramine maleate (10 micromol/l). In contrast to lower concentrations of atropine (1 micromol/l), higher concentrations of atropine (30 micromol/l) did block the effects of BDPBI on the PHE-precontracted aortic rings. HTMT dimaleate (0.01-10 micromol/l), a histamine H(1) receptor agonist, also elicited relaxation effects on the PHE-precontracted preparation, and the effects were blocked if the preparations were pretreated with diphenhydramine or chloropheniramine maleate. On isolated denuded aorta of the guinea pig, BDPBI did not elicit relaxation effects on the PHE-precontracted aortic rings. These results demonstrated that the vasorelaxation effect of BDPBI on PHE-precontracted aortic rings is partly dependent on the activation of a histaminergic receptor from the vascular endothelium.

The highly water soluble cationic drug, diltiazem HCl, was shown to bind to the polyanionic surfaces of the material to achieve a slight sustained release effect on dissolution testing due to reversible chemisorption and/or hindered release from the drug loaded lumen. A greater sustained release effect was more apparent when the less water soluble cationic drug, propranolol HCl, was examined. Attempts to further delay drug release by loading diltiazem HCl from a polyvinylpyrrolidone solution into the halloysite had little effect. However, a range of cationic polymers, including chitosan cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, was shown to bind to halloysite and was used to achieve significant delayed drug release. Coating with adequate polyethyleneimine was particularly effective at delaying drug release, being dependent on the architecture of the interaction between the polycation and the mineral. When a range of alkyl-2-cyanoacrylate monomers applied from a non-aqueous solvent by an in situ polymerisation procedure was examined, diltiazem HCl loaded halloysite dispersed in poly-iso-butyl cyanoacrylate was found to be the most effective at reducing the burst effect noted with aqueous coating systems.",

Similar effect was induced by propranolol, antidysrhythmic drug and an antagonist of beta-adrenergic receptor, but not by isoproterenol, a selective agonist of this receptor. Stimulation of serine base-exchange activity by amphiphilic cations occured at concentration as low as 5-25 microM that may be reached during clinical treatment. At much higher concentration (250 microM), those drugs also stimulated phospholipase D-mediated synthesis of [14C]phosphatidylethanol and blocked phorbol ester-induced, protein kinase C-dependent phospholipase D activity. The latter effect already occurred at low (25 microM) concentration of drugs. We have also shown that treatment of the cells with amphiphilic cations (1 mM) produced only a weak increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and did not affect Ca2+ release from the intracellular stores evoked by nucleotide receptor agonists, ATP and ADP. In contrast, this treatment strongly diminished an unspecific leak of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum caused by thapsigargin and ionomycin. Mianserin, which is not cationic amphiphilic drug, did not affect phosphatidylserine synthesis and phospholipase D activity and produced heterogenous and chaotic Ca2+ responses.

    "120": "The chronotropic effects of metoprolol (MP) in vivo after intravenous administration and in vitro in isolated atria of aortic coarctated rats were studied. MP levels in arterial dialysates and changes in arterial pressure and heart rate (HR) were determined after intravenous administration of MP. Affinity of MP by means of shifting of noradrenaline concentration-response curve and the inverse agonist activity of MP were studied in isolated atria. The IC(50) value of MP cardiac effect was smaller in aortic coarctated rats (13.0+/-5.4 ng ml(-1), n=5) than in sham operated (SO) rats (36.2+/-4.6 ng ml(-1), n=5). In isolated atria, no difference was found in MP dissociation constant and its inverse agonist activity between both experimental groups. In conclusion, the affinity and inverse agonism activity of MP would not be altered in aortic coarctated rats. A greater sensibility to the chronotropic effect of MP was found in coarctated rats.", 
    "121": "Chronic treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA), a potent immunosuppressive agent, is associated with the development of arterial hypertension. The effect of CsA on vascular responses was determined in Sprague-Dawley rats and rat aortic rings. Male rats weighing 250-300 g were given either CsA (25mg/kg/day) in olive oil or vehicle by intraperitoneal (ip) injection for 7 days. CsA administration produced a 42% increase (P<0.001) in mean arterial pressure (MAP) which reached a plateau after 3 days. The level of both nitrate/nitrite (NO(2)/NO(3)), metabolites of nitric oxide (NO), decreased by 50% (P<0.001), but the level of thromboxane A2 (TBXA2) increased by 75% (P<0.001), in the urine. When 10(-9)M of CsA was added acutely to intact aortic rings from untreated rats, NO(2)/NO(3) production decreased by 83% (P<0.011), but TBXA2 production increased by 86% (P<0.001). The effects of CsA were reversed both in vivo and in vitro by pretreatment with metoprolol (15 mg/kg/day ip), B1-adrenoceptor antagonist. There were no changes in MAP and tension in rats treated with metoprolol alone. In addition, in aorta of rats that were treated with CsA ip for 7 days, CsA significantly activated protein kinase C (PKC) translocation. This suggests that PKC mediate, in part, CsA-induced hypertension. In summary, CsA inhibits endothelial NO formation, activate PKC, and increase TBXA2 production, with resulting increase in MAP, and this changes can be overcome by pretreatment with metoprolol.",

The physical examination and an exercise electrocardiogram were carried out by his general practitioner up to 19 s at 350 W and a heart rate of 147/min without showing any abnormalities.", 
    "123": "All blood parameters revealed no signs of illness. During treadmill exercise at a heart rate of 181/min, a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced. Echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with an enddiastolic diameter of 70 mm and low fractional shortening (28 %). Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a diminished left ventricular ejection fraction (38 %) and an enlarged enddiastolic volume (199 ml) without signs of coronary artery disease. Electrophysiologic testing induced a non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.",

To reach a high sensitivity for diagnostic ergometry, the work-load must reach the maximal capacity of the cardio-pulmonary system. Differences in the exercise performance of athletes and untrained subjects have to be considered.", 
    "126": "An involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors is postulated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and mechanism of action of antidepressants. Methods for studying their functional integrity in humans are, however, limited. Preliminary data suggests that activation of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors cause a negative shift in the EEG frequency spectrum. Animal research suggests that pindolol is an agonist at these receptors but an antagonist at postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors.", 
    "127": "We postulated that while pindolol would antagonise known postsynaptic mediated neuroendocrine responses to the 5-HT(1A) agonist buspirone, both drugs would have a similar effect on the EEG frequency spectrum.", 
    "128": "Fourteen healthy men were administered placebo or pindolol (20 mg orally) 90 min before placebo or buspirone (30 mg orally) in a double blind cross-over study. Plasma prolactin and growth hormone were assayed and EEGs recorded before and after drug administration.", 
    "129": "A significant negative shift in the EEG frequency spectrum was found for both buspirone and pindolol, with the combination producing a similar effect to each drug alone. In contrast, the neuroendocrine response to buspirone was significantly attenuated by pindolol.", 
    "130": "The data obtained are consistent with the EEG effects of buspirone and pindolol being mediated by somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors, in contrast to the neuroendocrine response, which is known to be mediated by postsynaptic receptors. The development of this novel method of assessing somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors in humans is a potentially important advance which may allow the testing of hypotheses of its involvement in depression and response to antidepressants.", 
    "131": "We have reported that a marked elevation in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is a predictor for infarct expansion and cardiac rupture after AMI. Although beta-blockers prevent cardiac rupture after AMI, their effect on serum CRP elevation has not been determined.",

Eighty-two patients received beta-blocker treatment within 24 h of the onset of AMI, while 72 patients received no beta-blocker treatment. Peak serum creatine kinase (CK) and CRP levels were determined by serial measurements.", 
    "133": "There was no difference between the groups according to age, sex, coronary risk factors, pre-infarction angina, infarct site, prior use of cardiovascular drugs, use of revascularization therapy, and prevalence of multivessel disease. Beta-blocker treatment was associated with a lower peak CRP level (6.9 +/- 6.1 vs.10.8 +/- 9.3 mg/dl, p = 0.002), a shorter duration from the onset to the peak CRP level (2 +/- 1 vs. 3 +/- 2 days, p < 0.0001), a lower incidence of cardiac rupture (p = 0.03) and lower in-hospital cardiac mortality (p = 0.02), despite similar peak CK levels.",

    "137": "Our study was an observational investigation of metropolitan Worcester (Mass., USA) residents who were hospitalized with initial AMI in all area hospitals during 12 1-year periods between 1975 and 1999. Four age-specific subgroups (<55, 55-64, 65-74 and > or =75 years) were studied.", 
    "138": "Differences in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering medications and thrombolytic agents during hospitalization for AMI were examined. The results of a multivariable regression analysis indicated that women were significantly less likely to receive aspirin and ACE inhibitors as compared to men. There were no significant gender differences in the prescribing of the other cardiac medications. Increasing age in both women and men was associated with a reduced likelihood of receiving effective cardiac therapies including aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering therapy and thrombolytic agents.", 
    "139": "These data suggest that the reasons for the marked age-related differences, in men and women, in the use of cardiac medications be more systematically explored. Previously observed gender differences in the management of patients with AMI essentially no longer exist.", 
    "140": "The instant centre frequency (ICF) of RR interval has been proposed as a global index to analyse the sympathovagal interaction in the heart. The aim of this study was to assess the ICF during anaesthesia to test if it can reliably capture the neural control of the cardiovascular system. Twenty-four ASA II or III patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were included in the study. They were allocated in two groups: control, no treatment (group 1, n = 12), and beta-adrenergic blockade by atenolol (group 2, n = 12). Spectra of pulse interval series were computed with a time-frequency method and they were divided into: very low frequency (VLF, 0.000-0.040 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.050-0.150 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.160-0.500 Hz). Normalized power was obtained by dividing the cumulative power within each frequency band (LF or HF) by the sum of LF and HF; the ratio of LF/HF was also calculated. Instant centre frequency is a time-varying parameter that the evolution along time of the gravity centrum of a local spectrum. All spectral indexes were recorded at the following time points: before induction, after induction and before intubation, during intubation, and after intubation. The atenolol group had lower normalized LF and the LF/HF ratio (P < 0.05) higher HF before induction; and lower LF/HF ratio after induction and before intubation (P < 0.05). The ICF was higher in atenolol group at all times. The ICF shifted towards HF frequency after induction and before intubation and shifted towards LF during intubation in both groups. The autonomic nervous system control on the heart through the interaction of sympathetic and parasympathetic reflex mechanisms could be studied by the ICF. The ICF may assess the autonomic cardiac modulation and may provide useful information for anaesthetic management.", 
    "141": "Patients with stage II hypertensive disease have been shown to derive apparent benefit from treatment with a combination of the beta-adrenoblocker nebivolol and inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme enap that was evidenced by improvement in hemodynamics, in echocardiographic characteristics promoting a decline in the activity of the basic enzyme of the tissue formation angiotensin II chimase and an increase in the level of its most important inhibitor alpha-2-macroglobulin.", 
    "142": "Combined therapy with lozartan and metoprolol in patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency has a consistent effect on the levels of epinephrine, angoitensin II, vasopressin, atrial naturiuretic factor, insulin, endothelline, thromboxane B2, guanosine monophosphate, 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha, and bradikinin. As to norepinephrine, there has been noted an inconsistent therapeutic effect. It is suggested that the time-related course of a long-term therapy might be associated with a formation of the aldosterone \"escape\" phenomenon.", 
    "143": "In experiments involving simulation of ischemic heart disease in adult rabbits, morphofunctional aspects were studied of cardioprotective action of propranolol on the contractile myocardium. With the aid of histological and histochemical, electron microscopic tests, the drug under consideration has been shown to be endowed with membrane-stabilizing properties, quite aside its receptor-mediated effects on Ca2+ metabolism known for. A decrease in its excessive ingress into the sarcoplasma comes, in its turn, to improve energy and plastic maintenance of the myocardial functions, to moderate a pathological reorganization and destructive changes in cardiomyocytes, thus promoting the contractile myocardium resistance to recurrent coronary crises.", 
    "144": "The beta(1)-selective blocker talinolol is incompletely absorbed in man from an \"absorption window\" in the upper small intestine which is under control of P-glycoprotein. The following single dose, four-period, changeover study with 7 days washout in 36 healthy subjects (21 females, age 20-33 years) was designed to confirm bioequivalence of four marketed tablet formulations of talinolol with identical in vitro liberation and to deduce from the intrasubject and intersubject variability of talinolol pharmacokinetics on the variability of intestinal P-gp function. All point estimates of the primary criteria AUC(0-infinity) and C(max) for the comparison of the galenic forms were within 0.9-1.10. The 90% confidence intervals were entirely within the standard ranges of bioequivalence (0.80-1.25 for AUC(0-infinity), 0.70-1.43 for C(max)). The intra- and intersubject coefficients of variation for AUC(0-infinity) were 14.0% and 20.4-29.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the four talinolol tablets are bioequivalent in extent and rate of absorption. The low intrasubject variability of the AUC(0-infinity) after weekly administration of the tablets refers to a small intrasubject variability of the \"absorption window\" and elimination of talinolol that most likely depends on the expression of P-gp in the small intestine.", 
    "145": "Changes in cardiac myofilament Ca(2+) activation have been demonstrated in ovariectomized rats. The underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes, however, are unknown. Accordingly, we measured both density and binding affinity of cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in sarcolemmal preparations from 10-week ovariectomized rats, pair-fed ovariectomized rats, and sham-operated control rats. Receptor protein content was also measured by immunoblotting. Deprivation of ovarian sex hormones for 10 weeks induced a significant upregulation of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors without affecting binding affinity. The same magnitude of receptor upregulation was also detected in pair-fed ovariectomized hearts. To determine which hormone is responsible for the observed increase in beta(1)-adrenergic receptor density, various sex hormone supplemental regimens were administered to ovariectomized rats. Subcutaneous injection of estrogen (5 microg/rat), progesterone (1 mg/rat), or estrogen plus progesterone three times a week all effectively prevented the upregulation of the beta(1)-adrenoceptors. Western blot analyses using polyclonal antibody of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors revealed the same pattern of changes in the protein content of the receptors in these various groups of experimental hearts as those obtained from the receptor binding assay. These results suggest a possible direct suppressive effect of ovarian sex hormones on the expression of cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "146": "To evaluate the comparative efficacy of latanoprost monotherapy versus combined carteolol and pilocarpine therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glaucoma.", 
    "147": "Masked randomized prospective trial. This study included 51 patients (64 eyes) with newly diagnosed glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The cases were randomly divided into two treatment groups for administration of latanoprost 0.005% once daily, or of carteolol 2% twice daily and pilocarpine 2% twice daily. Mean diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline, week 2, week 4, and month 3 after the beginning of treatment. Changes in mean IOP from baseline to the 3-month visit were determined by an analysis of variance.", 
    "148": "Mean diurnal IOP values were 25.1 +/- 3.1 mm Hg and 25.5 +/- 2.5 mm Hg at baseline in the latanoprost monotherapy group and in the carteolol-plus-pilocarpine group, respectively. Diurnal IOP was significantly decreased from baseline to 3 months in both groups (P <.001). At this time point, latanoprost monotherapy had reduced mean diurnal IOP by 7.2 +/- 2.5 mm Hg (28.7%) and carteolol plus pilocarpine had reduced mean diurnal IOP by 7.4 +/- 2.7 mm Hg (29%). There was no difference between the groups in terms of their IOP reduction effect (P =.51). Decreased visual acuity and twilight vision, blurred vision, and headache were more frequent in the carteolol-plus-pilocarpine group than in the latanoprost group (P <.05).", 
    "149": "We concluded that latanoprost monotherapy was at least as effective as the carteolol-pilocarpine combination therapy in reducing mean diurnal IOP in newly diagnosed glaucoma or ocular hypertension."
