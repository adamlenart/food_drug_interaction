Both beta-receptor blocking agents showed the following effects 24 h after treatment: 1. The maximal capacity for ergometric load was significantly reduced by atenolol as well as by propranolol retard in comparison to the control. 2. The heart rate was also significantly reduced by both beta-blocking agents after 24 h. 3. The systolic blood pressure during ergometric load as well as the diastolic blood pressure at rest showed significantly lower values 24 h after treatment with both agents.", 
    "1": "Bronchodilating action and influence on the cardiovascular system of 1-(2-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-t-butylaminoethanol (HOKU-81), which is one of metabolites of tulobuterol obtained from rat urine, were examined using the isolated tracheae and atria of guinea pigs in vitro and dogs in vivo in comparison with those of the parent drug, i.e., tulobuterol isoprenaline, salbutamol and other reference bronchodilators. HOKU-81 was approximately 8 times more potent than tulobuterol, approximately twice as potent as salbutamol, and approximately as potent as isoprenaline in relaxing effect on the isolated tracheal smooth muscle preparation of guinea pigs. This effect of HOKU-81 seems to be due to direct action on the adrenergic beta-receptor. In anaesthetized dogs, bronchodilating effect of HOKU-81 was much more potent than that of tulobuterol and was approximately as potent as that of salbutamol when administered i.v., and its effect lasted for many hours. When administered orally, the duration of bronchodilating effect of HOKU-81 was almost as long as that of salbutamol. The cardiac stimulating effect of HOKU-81 examined in the isolated guinea pig artia and in anaesthetized dogs was weaker than those of isoprenaline and salbutamol, though stronger than that of tulobuterol. In the present studies in vitro as well as in vivo, the selectivity ratio of HOKU-81 for beta-adrenoceptors in the tracheal smooth muscle vs. those in the right atrial muscle was the largest of all the bronchodilators used.", 
    "2": "The effect of two preparations of oxprenolol (80 mg twice a day; 160 mg slow-release once a day) on the diurnal non-steady-state exercise performance in patients with coronary heart disease (N = 11) has been studied after a treatment period of at least 7 days. 2 h after the intake of the standard preparation (80 mg oxprenolol) the symptom-limited exercise performance increased by 24%. The onset of symptoms of physical intolerance was postponed to work rates of heavier intensity (+18.8%). Despite a considerable fall in the exercise heart rate (-18.4%) the oxygen uptake per load was not affected suggesting that the adjustment of the cardio-pulmonary system to graded exercise was not impaired. As the reduction of the exercise heart rate is regarded as a distinct sign of beta-receptor blockade the standard regimen demonstrates a considerable long-term effect with respect to the heart rate regulation next morning (time interval 16 h). The slow-release preparation acts less powerfully in reducing the exercise heart rate in any test, but the beneficial effects on limiting symptoms of physical performance equal the standard regimen. The duration of the efficacy of slow-release oxprenolol is certainly limited: no effect on the exercise heart rate was demonstrable next morning (time interval 25 h). To improve the efficacy in symptomatic treatment of coronary heart disease the duration of effects of the drug and the physical activities of the individual during every day life should be taken into account to adjust the timing for intake.", 
    "3": "The antihypertensive effect of 80 mg/day of the newly synthesized beta-blocker 1-tert. butylamino-3-(2-cyclo-pentylphenoxy)-2-propanol-sulfate (penbutolol, Hoe 893d) was studied in patients (n = 36) suffering from primary hypertension in comparison to the effect of 750 mg alpha-methyldopa/day. It was demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of both drugs is identical. Furthermore it was shown that the antihypertensive effect of penbutolol under an uncontrolled diet is unrelated to the patient's basal plasma-renin concentration.", 
    "4": "Multistage treadmill stress testing was performed in 24 patients with idiopathic cardiomyopathy using Bruce protocol. 5 patients were considered to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), 12 hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 7 congestive cardiomyopathy (CCM). Heart rate, systemic blood pressure, electrocardiographic changes and exercise tolerance were observed. The effect of propranolol on exercise tolerance was investigated in HOCM and HCM. 1) Exercise duration was less in patients with HCM and HOCM than in normal subjects (50 subjects) and greater than in 50 anginal patients. In CCM, exercise duration was the least. 2) Electrocardiographic changes observed in HCM and HOCM were increase of T waves and lessening of ST depression. In CCM, appearance of ventricular arrhythmia was noted in 4 of 7 patients. 3) Maximam exercise tolerance was reached at Bruce state III-IV in HOCM, stage III in HCM and stage II in CCM. 4) Propranolol administration resulted in improvement of exercise tolerance in 3 of 7 patients with HOCM and HCM.", 
    "5": "Experiments were conducted on rats. Sexual cycle, the state of the sexual system, and the gonadotropic activity of the hypophysis were studied in chronic administration of phentholamine and obsidan. Sexual cycle was found to be disturbed in 60% of rats given phentholamine and in 25% of animals to which obsidan was administered. There was no change in weight of the ovaries or of the uteri in rats treated with adrenoblockers. At the same time the height of the uterine epithelium was diminished, and also a distinct elevation of gonadotropin activity of the hypophysis was seln. It is suggested that chronic administration of adrenoblockers was accompanied by inhibition of gonadotropins secretion from the hypophysis; reduction of the hormonal function of the ovaries ensued.", 
    "6": "One hundred nineteen patients with essential hypertension (96 completing six months and 92 a one year study period) were randomized into four parallel groups and treated with one of four programs: 200 mg of metoprolol plus placebo; 200 mg of metoprolol plus 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide; 200 mg of metoprolol plus 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or; 200 mg metoprolol plus 50 mg of hydralazine. Blood pressure reduction was significant in these all groups and no differences were observed in blood pressure reduction among the groups. During the one year therapy the levels of serum bilirubin, uric acid and triglycerides were significantly increased in all groups but the group treated with metoprolol and hydralazine. Serum cholesterol level did not increase in any group during the one year therapy. The results indicate that the combination therapy in mild to moderate hypertension should not be initiated before individual response to single drug therapy is evaluated. Antihypertensive drug treatment may cause some biochemical changes and those changes seem to be smallest patients treated with combination of beta-blocker and hydralazine.", 
    "7": "A double-blind, within-patient study was carried out in 23 newly diagnosed patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure of at least 100 mmHg) to compare the antihypertensive effects of atenolol (100 mg) and chlorthalidone (25 mg) given in free and fixed combination. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients received each of the two active treatments and also placebo for periods of 4 weeks, the treatment sequence being randomized. A single daily drug dose was taken 24 to 28 hours before each blood pressure measurement at 2-weekly intervals. The results showed that both active drug combinations lowered lying, standing and post-exercise blood pressure significantly and there was no statistical difference between the two forms of treatment. Two-thirds of the patients were adequately controlled with the single daily dose regimen and few side-effects were reported.", 
    "8": "In conscious sodium-deficient dogs, beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol and angiotensin II receptor blockade with an angiotensin II inhibitory analogue reduced arterial blood pressure and increased urinary sodium excretion significantly, but the hypotensive and natriuretic response was considerably greater during inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme with captopril. Angiotensin II infusion (3 ng/kg/min) into sodium-deficient dogs maintained on captopril administration restored arterial blood pressure, urinary sodium excretion, and plasma aldosterone concentration to levels that existed in untreated sodium-deficient dogs. This indicates that the hypotensive and natriuretic actions of captopril are due to the inhibition of angiotensin II formation and not to the accumulation of the vasodepressor peptide, bradykinin.", 
    "9": "1. Fourteen patients with angina with obstructive coronary artery disease were treated with propranolol, given four times daily, or penbutolol given once daily. 2. The frequency of anginal episodes and glyceryl trinitrate consumption were monitored using diary cards. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at rest and on exercise. Left ventricular function was assessed using systolic time intervals. 3. Penbutolol given once daily showed similar effects as propranolol, using both clinical assessment and changes in physiological parameters.", 
    "10": "Atenolol, 50 mg, b.i.d., and propranolol, 80 mg b.i.d.,. were given to 28 patients with a presumed diagnosis of migraine, in a placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study, where each period lasted 6 weeks. In the total material, atenolol was significantly better than placebo in reducing attacks, whereas propranolol showed no definite such effect. In seven patients the number of headache days was remarkably high (average: 22 headache days in 42 days), which may indicate that they have been inappropriately included in the material or have recorded interparoxysmal headache in addition to attacks. If these patients are excluded, the attack-reducing effect of propranolol and tenormin is significant and of equal magnitude.", 
    "11": "The selective beta-1 blocker Metoprolol was tested for a period of one month in a double-blind trial involving 36 patients with open-angle glaucoma or intraocular hypertension in whom the substance was applied twice daily to the eye in concentrations of 1, 2, 4 and 8%. At all these concentrations the intraocular pressure showed a reduction of 23%. The concentrations over 1% were less well tolerated, the difference being statistically significant; the patients concerned complained of an unpleasant burning sensation for 30 seconds after the application. The subjective intolerance shown increased in proportion to the concentration. It is not clear whether the solvent used contributed to the intolerance. The Metoprolol drops had no effect on pupillary diameter, blood pressure or resting pulse. An important finding was that during the one month's treatment there was no fall-off in the effectiveness of the preparation, i.e., the reduction in intraocular pressure and duration of action showed no diminution such as is seen, for example, with Timolol.", 
    "12": "Captopril (100mg/kg) administered daily by gavage to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) from their 6th to 20th weeks of age almost completely inhibited genetic hypertension development (GHD). This effect was correlated with an early and long-lasting limitation of the progressive increase in peripheral resistance which normally develops in SHRs during their growth. Heart rate, cardiac and systolic indexes remained unchanged, plasma renin concentration was significantly increased and heart weight/body weight ratio was significantly decreased. At last, captopril's GHD preventive effect persisted up to 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation.", 
    "13": "Three groups of ten similar obese children were infused with one of three protocols. Protocol I glucose only (1.15 mM/min/m2). protocol II, glucose, insulin (42 mM/min/m2). Protocol III, glucose insulin, propanolol (0.04 mg/min/m2) adrenalin (3 micrograms/min/m2). Eighteen newly diagnosed diabetic children without acidosis received glucose according to protocol II. Thirteen normal adults (controls) received glucose infusion according to protocol I. Protocols I and II were well tolerated and gave consistent results but Protocol III was not well tolerated and did not give interpretable results. In obese children steady state blood glucose levels are significantly higher than in controls but this difference was only moderate (8.8 + 0.7 mM, against 6.6 +/- 0.4 mM for protocol I). There was no difference in insulin levels. In diabetic children the steady state was more rarely obtained after a 120 min infusion and blood glucose levels were higher than in the controls or in obese children.", 
    "14": "MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase was measured every 3 hours during the first 24 hours of admission to C.C.U. and successively every 4-6 hours in the next 24-48 hours in 42 patients with acute transmural myocardial infarction. The pain-C.C.U. admission time interval was less than 6 hours in all cases. 22 patients were treated by propranolol (2 mg bolus followed by 0.1 mg/Kg/die for the next 48 hours in continuous i.v. infusion), 20 patients served as a control. Cumulated activity, peak plasma value, rate of release and total duration of release of MB-CK did not differ significantly between the two groups. In patients treated within 3 hours from pain onset (n = 12) cumulated activity, peak plasma value and rate of release of MB-CK were significantly inferior than control group. In patients treated between the 3rd and 6th hour from pain onset (n = 10) the total duration of release of isoenzyme was significantly prolonged. No treated patients developed clinical or radiologic signs of cardiac insufficiency. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was 17% in the treated group vs. 62% in the control group (P < 0.05). The data show that propranolol, if started early in the course of acute myocardial infarction, reduces significantly infarct size and slows down the evolution of necrotic process.", 
    "15": "A double-blind crossover study was carried out to investigate the effects of cyclopenthiazide and oxprenolol on blood lipids in 20 previously untreated patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After a 4-week placebo period, patients received at random either 8-weeks' treatment with the two drugs followed by 8 weeks on cyclopenthiazide alone, or the reversed sequence. Daily doses were 160 mg slow-release oxprenolol and/or 0.25 mg cyclopenthiazide during the first 4 weeks of each treatment period, after which the dosage was doubled. Data from 13 patients who completed the trial showed no significant changes in the blood levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol or LDL and HDL cholesterol fractions. These findings are discussed in relation to published studies on the effects of other beta-blockers on blood lipids.", 
    "16": "The detection, clinical significance, and management strategies of VPBs in ambulatory patients have been presented. VPBs can be easily detected by a variety of recording techniques, and the major risk posed by VPBs occurs predominantly in patients with complex VPB patterns and concomitant organic heart disease. Available antiarrhythmic therapy is quite limited, and efficacy, convenience, and tolerance considerations dictate a conservative approach to initiating therapy. Risk-benefit considerations must be reasoned through in each patient. Presently, drug risks closely approximate those of the underlying cardiac condition, and the benefits from antiarrhythmic drug therapy are marginal at the very best. However, antiarrhythmic therapy has special relevance for the high risk cardiac patient. A Yiddish proverb states, \"Ever since dying came into fashion, life hasn't been safe.\" Hopefully, antiarrhythmic therapy is making life safer for the high risk ambulatory patient.", 
    "17": "Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were studied in ten adult diabetics treated in a cross-over fashion for at least three weeks with alprenolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, or with metoprolol, a cardioselective beta 1-blocker. Dietary intake was controlled three days prior to the study which comprised both i.v. and oral glucose tolerance tests. Mean fasting blood glucose levels were significantly higher on alprenolol than on metoprolol. The increase in fasting blood glucose was particularly pronounced in two patients. In these subjects the glucose tolerance following both an i.v. and an oral glucose load was reduced when treatment was switched from metoprolol to alprenolol. Lower plasma insulin levels in response to glucose were also found in these patients on alprenolol than on metoprolol. The mean insulin levels for all ten patients did not differ significantly between the two treatment periods. These data show that treatment with a non-selective beta-blocker can in some patients cause a considerable deterioration of the glucose tolerance, presumably due to inhibition of insulin release.", 
    "18": "Arterial blood pressure and plasma catecholamines, renin activity and aldosterone concentration in 12 patients with severe essential hypertension were studied before and after combined alpha- and beta- adrenoceptor blockade induced by oral labetalol treatment for 2 months. Frusemide in a fixed dose was employed as a basic antihypertensive agent throughout the study. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in only 6 patients. Mean body weight increased by 1.8 kg and there was a rise in body weight which was inversely correlated with the fall in standing mean blood pressure. The mean plasma noradrenaline concentration decreased from 0.30 to 0.20 ng/ml, whereas plasma adrenaline did not change significantly. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration varied greatly, but the mean values did not change significantly. Change in body weight was correlated inversely with changes in plasma noradrenaline and renin. The results suggest that labetalol, through its combined alpha- and beta- adrenoceptor blocking action, induces a rise in body weight, probably due to sodium and fluid retention, which partly counterbalances its anti-hypertensive effect and partly modifies both renin and sympathetic nervous activity.", 
    "19": "Renal prostaglandins play a role in the control of renin release during chronic sodium depletion, during the acute phase of renovascular hypertension and in experimental low output heart failure in conscious dogs. However, with marked inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, the adrenergic nervous system and the renal prostaglandins, PRA was still 17 times normal during chronic sodium depletion. After blockade of the adrenergic nervous system and the renal prostaglandins, PRA was 10 times normal during the acute phase of one-kidney renovascular hypertension. These findings demonstrate that other important mechanisms, possibly both the renal vascular receptor (so-called baroreceptor) and the macula densa, were involved. Both PGI2 and PGD2 given intrarenally increased renin release in both filtering and nonfiltering kidneys, but PGI2 was more potent than PGD2. Available evidence favors a role of PGI2 and it seems likely that the site of action is on the JG cells. Indomethacin produced a profound drop in CCr and CPAH during sodium depletion and in experimental heart failure which demonstrates an important role for the renal prostaglandins in the control of renal arteriolar tone. An important incidental finding is that renal denervation combined with propranolol administration decreased PRA from very high levels to normal in 50% of the dogs with experimental low output heart failure and a concurrent striking natriuresis occurred.", 
    "20": "The activity of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) was found to be increased in serial plasma samples from patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Maximum activity occurred 18 hr after the onset of chest pain, and a further peak of activity was found at 72 hr. Four isozymes of NAG were resolved from samples of human myocardium. All four isozymes were present in plasma from patients with AMI but not in normal plasma. beta-Glucuronidase, which is also present in myocardium, had increased activity in plasma at 18 hr but not at 72 hr in patients with AMI. Lysozyme, a lysosomal enzyme in white blood cells, had increased activity in plasma at 72 hr. There was a linear relationship (r = 0.98) between peak levels of NAG at 18 hr and the peak activity of the MB-isozyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB). Three groups of 10 patients were treated with drugs known to stabilize lysosomes during experimental myocardial anoxia. The first group received 25 mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate i.v. within 4 hr of the onset of chest pain. The second group received propranolol, 5-mg, i.v. within 4 hr of the onset of chest pain. The second group received propranolol, 5-mg, i.v. within 4 hr of the onset of chest pain, and the third group comprised patients who developed AMI while on propranolol therapy and were maintained on this drug after admission to the hospital. All three groups showed an alteration in the pattern of lysosomal and cytosolic enzyme activity and a relative reduction in NAG activity compared to CK-MB.", 
    "21": "The effects of propranolol (100 mg/kg), atenolol (200 mg/kg) and acebutolol (1000 mg/kg) administered daily by gavage to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) from their 6th to 20th weeks of age were investigated on genetic hypertension development (GHD) and at regular intervals on heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), peripheral resistence (PR), plasma renin concentration (PRC) and heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW). Treatment with propranolol and especially atenolol markedly inhibited GHD while acebutolol was ineffective. No correlation was found between GHD prevention and (1) the degree of beta-adrenergic blockade (2) the reductions in HR and CO and (3) the decrease in PRC induced by the three treatments. Although none of the three drugs prevented the progressive increase in PR which develops in SHRs during their growth, propranolol and atenolol opposed GHD mainly by reducing CO, this effect being however partly counterbalanced for atenolol by a secondary potentiation of PR increase. With acebutolol, a similar reinforcement of PR increase occurred which completely neutralized the reduction in CO, resulting in the drug's ineffectiveness against GHD. These differential effects of the three drugs probably reflect different early induced structural modifications at cardiac and/or vascular levels.", 
    "22": "The effect of a single dose of 100 mg metoprolol tartrate (Lopresor) on airway flow resistance, intrathoracic gas volume, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate was studied in 10 patients with obstructive disease of the airways in a double-blind trial versus placebo. Metoprolol showed no significant effect on the flow resistance in the airways, although in some patients a clear increase in flow resistance was evident. The effect on pulse rate was significant, while that on blood pressure was less pronounced. Therefore the effect of metoprolol on airway flow resistance is similar to that of atenolol and pindolol, while it can be assumed to be superior to propranolol in this respect. The beta 2-stimulator fenoterol is capable of lowering the flow resistance in patients with chronic obstructive disease of the airways extremely satisfactorily, and equally well after metoprolol or after placebo.", 
    "23": "The hypotensive effect of nifedipine was studied in 9 patients with severe hypertension. After oral administration of 20 mg nifedipine mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell, reaching lowest values about 1 h p.a. The antihypertensive effect lasted 7 h. Treatment with nifedipine alone (80 mg/day) lowered MAP significantly on the first day, but it tended to rise again therealter. Addition of clonidine (450 micrograms/day) or propranolol (120 mg/day) enhanced the hypotensive effect. Furosemide (120 mg/day) was ineffective when added to the above described regimen. Without nifedipine the combine drugs failed to keep MAP down. The decrease of MAP observed when giving this combination of drugs was associated with a significant fall in total peripheral resistance and plasma renin activity, but did not alter cardiac output and blood volume. We concluded that nifedipine together with clonidine or propranolol is very effective in the management of severe hypertension.", 
    "24": "TWELVE patients with moderately severe angina pectoris completed a double blind cross-over comparison of conventional propranolol (40 mg q.i.d.) and Inderal L.A. (160 mg once daily) with regard to therapeutic effectiveness, blood levels, compliance and patient acceptability.Exercise tolerance was assessed using standardised treadmill testing at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after the morning dose. The double placebo technique was used.Patient compliance was excellent for both regimes and no serious side effects were reported. No significant differences in exercise tolerance or blood levels were observed between the two treatments at any time.", 
    "25": "The author gave timolol to 4 patients with cluster headaches instilling it in the form of a 0.5% solution into the conjunctival sac during attacks. Usually the attacks were significantly shortened and alleviated. Trials with placebo gave negative results. The method requires verification in a larger material but even now it appears to be worth of recommendiation.", 
    "26": "In an open study of fifteen patients with essential hypertension, acebutolol, a cardioselective B 1-adrenoceptor antagonist given orally once daily at dosages of between 400 mg and 1200 mg, produced a substantial and progressive reduction in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and in the tension time index both in the lying and standing position over the 3 months of the trial. The changes from pre-trial values of blood pressure assessments were statistically significant (p less than 0.001). No side-effects were reported and laboratory monitoring of biological parameters revealed no untoward effects of treatment.", 
    "27": "The effect of a vasodilator (hydralazine), a beta-blocker (oxprenolol) and also their combination, on essential arterial hypertension and plasma renin activity (PRA), was studied. Eighteen patients with mild hypertension (WHO I or II) were treated for 4 weeks with oxprenolol, hydralazine and their combination, with 4-week placebo periods between the active treatment periods. Oxprenolol and hydralazine lowered the blood pressure to a similar degree and their combination accentuated this effect. PRA decreased significantly on both the oxprenolol and the combination therapy, but increased during the following placebo and hydralazine periods to a level slightly higher than the initial level. Another group of eleven patients were treated with oxprenolol for 20 weeks. Blood pressure decreased almost to a normotensive level during the first 4 weeks of treatment and a little lower during the following 4 weeks. It remained at this level until the end of the trial. PRA decreased significantly during the first 4 weeks on oxprenolol and remained low during the whole 20-week treatment period. No correlation was found between the change in blood pressure caused by oxprenolol treatment and the initial placebo value of PRA, or, the change in PRA on oxprenolol treatment. These results support the view that the level of PRA has no significance when an antihypertensive treatment is being selected, e.g. beta-blockers.", 
    "28": "1-tert.-Butylamino-3-(2-cyclopentylphenoxy)-propan-2-ol (penbutolol, Hoe 893d) is a beta-adrenergic blocking agent about 4 times more active than propranolol in vivo and in vitro. In comparison to propranolol it is characterized by a longer lasting activity. The antihypertensive effect of penbutolol in spontaneously hypertonic rats is more than 5 times stronger than that of propranolol. Penbutolol reduces basal plasma renin activity in the same dose range as does propranolol but is about 3 times stronger with respect to isoproterenol-induced increase of PRA. Penbutolol is 5 times more potent than propranolol inhibiting isoproterenol-stimulated phosphorylase activity in the isolated heart. In reserpine pretreated rats, penbutolol has a moderate intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Penbutolol shows less unspecific actions -- such as negative inotropy or calcium antagonism -- than propranolol. Characteristic parameters of lung function (compliance and resistance) are less affected by penbutolol than propranolol in spite of the fact that penbutolol has a stronger beta-adrenergic blocking effect.", 
    "29": "For the evaluation of arrhythmias and the assessment of antiarrhythmic therapy prolonged periods of recording, as provided by the Holter system, are needed. The 12 lead electrocardiogram and rhythm strips are unsuitable for these purposes. However an exercise test may provide useful additional information. In two trials mexiletine was compared with other antiarrhythmic drugs (atenolol, disopyramide, lorcainide) and placebo. In both trials mexiletine was shown to have a good antiarrhythmic efficacy on chronic ventricular premature beats. The high incidence of side-effects was probably due to the high dosage used.", 
    "30": "The antiarrhythmic effect of metoprolol after chronic treatment has been evaluated by 24 hour Holter monitoring in 16 patients with several premature ventricular beats and in 14 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and compared with the effect of a placebo. Metoprolol induced a mean decrease of heart rate of 14.5% in the 16 patients and reduced the mean value/min of the ventricular premature beats of the 51.2%. In addition the use of metoprolol abolished the ventricular premature beats in 9 cases, while in two cases there was an increase of their frequency. In the 14 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation metoprolol was able to reverse to sinus rhythm three of the patients and in the remaining 11 decreased the ventricular heart rate of the 33%.", 
    "31": "A double-blind study of oral metoprolol and propranolol in nine patients with chronic bronchitis (Medical Research Council definition) showed no appreciable deterioration in lung function or significant differences between the two drugs.", 
    "32": "In vitro liberation of insulin from pancreas, stimulated with taurine, was not decreased after blocking of alpha- and beta-receptors of Langerhans' islets. Taurine increased the hexokinase activity in pancreas. The stimulating effect of taurine on the insulin-incretory activity of pancreas appears to be due to active interference of the amino acid with glycolysis of the tissue cells.", 
    "33": "A placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial was conducted to determine whether propranolol helps cigarette smokers to stop smoking; 73 subjects entered the trial but at the end of eight weeks only six had stopped smoking, three in the propranolol and three in the placebo group. There was no evidence of any helpful effect of propranolol in subjects trying to stop smoking.", 
    "34": "Myocardial injury was studied in 104 patients undergoing coronary artery grafting without cold chemical cardioplegia using the quantity of the isoenzyme MB of the creatine kinase liberated as an indicator. This method of evaluation, which is said to permit comparison of different techniques of myocardial protection, allowed us to consider the relative importance of several factors believed to have an influence on intraoperative myocardial injury. Indices of significance were duration of symptoms before operation, presence of chronic arterial hypertension, and the type of antiangina treatment employed. Other operative factors included severity of the arterial lesions, number of anastomoses performed, and duration of extracorporeal circulation and of aortic cross-clamping.", 
    "35": "The concentration of atenolol in plasma and urine was determined following an intravenous (i.v.) dose given to 17 hypertensive patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between 5 and 105 ml/min and in 4 patients on hemodialysis. In patients with normal renal function the mean half life of elimination was calculated to be 6.8 h. This value increased to a mean of 50.1 h in patients with a GFR below 10 ml/min. In patients on hemodialysis the half life of elimination was about 4 h. The elimination rate constants as well as the body and renal clearances of atenolol have a significant correlation with the GFR. Although accumulation of atenolol was observed, especially after multiple oral doses and in patients with a GFR below 30 ml/min, no toxic side effects occurred.", 
    "36": "In 6 male insulin-dependent proteinuric long-term diabetics aged 26-35 years the rate of progression of nephropathy was followed for an initial control period of 2.0 years and subsequently for 4.1 years during antihypertensive therapy with a beta-receptor blocker combined with Hydralazine and Furosemide. GFR and urinary albumin excretion was measured 3-4 times before and 9-14 times during treatment. Systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly from 162 +/- 14 (SD) mm Hg before treatment to 146 +/- 9 (SD) as a mean during the whole treatment period (2p = 0.002). Diastolic pressure was also reduced significantly, from 103 +/- 9 (SD) mm Hg to 95 +/- 8 (SD), (2p = 0.025). After 49 days of treatment there was a significant fall in albumin clearance as a per cent of GFR from 0.243 +/- 0.28 (SD) to 0.170 +/- 0.20 (SD), (2p < 0.001 for percentage change) with no change in GFR. In five patients the fall rate of GFR was in the initial control period 1.24 ml/min/month +/- 0.8 (SD). In the period when antihypertensive therapy was given it was reduced to 0.45 ml/min/month +/- 0.5 (SD) (2p = 0.037). In the 6th patient there was no decline in GFR neither before, nor during treatment. Before treatment there was a mean yearly percentage increase in albumin excretion of 107 per cent. During treatment this yearly increase was reduced to--7 per cent (2p = 0.002 for differences in slope). The results indicate that the state of renal insufficiency in diabetic patients with nephropathy and moderately increased blood pressure can be postponed by antihypertensive treatment. Other trials should be carried out to define the optimal scheme of treatment.", 
    "37": "Twenty-seven patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma were tested to see if, and to what extent, timolol and dipivalyl-epinephrine produced a supplementary reduction of intraocular pressure. In a shortterm study, 14 patients were tested with timolol (0.1%) and dipivalyl-epinephrine (0.25%). Simultaneous application of both substances produced a statistically more significant reduction of intraocular pressure than either timolol (0.1%) or dipivalyl-epinephrine (0.25%) alone. In 13 patients a comparison was made between patients who received both timolol (0.25%) and dipivalyl-epinephrine (0.1%) bis x and patients who received only timolol (0.25%) bis x over a period of 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Both substances used in combination produced a statistically more significant reduction in intraocular pressure than timolol (0.25%) bis x alone. The simultaneous application of an alpha and beta-adrenergic agonist and beta-adrenergic antagonist is not contradictory. The results are discussed on the basis of the mode of action of the applied substances.", 
    "38": "Lacrimal function was studied in 30 patients treated for glaucoma, with 0.25% timolol eye drops. Rose bengal and fluorescein staining disclosed punctate epithelial defects in 11 eyes after one week. During the following weeks there defects disappeared spontaneously in most eyes. Schirmer tests (I and II), tear lysozyme and pre-corneal film break-up time were significantly decreased by the treatment, while tear immunoglobulins were unimpaired. The authors conclude that topical timolol treatment decreases tear production. This effect is quantitatively limited and does not appear dangerous for normal eyes, although it may become so for eyes with an originally low lacrimal secretion.", 
    "39": "Undesirable side effects have limited the use of adrenaline/guanethidine combinations in the usual concentrations in the treatment of chronic simple glaucoma. Better tolerance to lower concentrations has already been demonstrated in other studies. In the double-blind study described here, three different combinations (adrenaline 1%, 0.5% and 0.2% combined respectively with guanethidine 5%, 3% and 1%) were compared in respect of their depressive action on intraocular pressure and the tolerance shown to them. All three combinations were found to be effective. The combination with the lowest concentration was significantly less hypotensive in its effect than the other two but the number of patients treated was too small to allow a clear distinction to be made between the effects of the other two combinations. Nevertheless, there was a tendency for the effectiveness to fall with decreasing concentration. As far as tolerance was concerned, there was little difference between the middle and lowest concentrations, the latter being that best tolerated. The excellent effect of the strongest concentration was impaired by the poor tolerance shown to it. The comparison between the three combinations was followed by a study of the diurnal pressure changes in patients during the course of the treatment. The slow rise up to midday and the abrupt afternoon fall remain unexplained. The low concentration of the preparation had a better hypotensive action than pilocarpine, while the middle concentration proved even a little better than the beta-blocker Timolol", 
    "40": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was evaluated in 7 hypertensives with pure isthmic coarctation of the aorta. RAS was studied under basal conditions, standing, after saralasine (a specific angiotensin II antagonist) and after acebutolol (a cardioselective beta-blocker and an inhibitor of renin secretion). Plasma volume was measured by radio isotopic methods and cardiac catheterisation was performed to assess the pressure gradient across the coarctation. On a normal salt diet on orthostatism, plasma renin activity (PRA) was increased in 5 patients and normal in the other 2. After moderate salt depletion, saralasine injection caused a significant fall in diastolic blood pressure (89,2 +/- 4,4 to 77,3 +/- 6,6 mmHg; p < 0,02) with an associated rise in PRA (5,7 +/- 4,4 to 17,1 +/- 9,1; p < 0,01). There was no correlation between these two parameters or their variations. The test was negative in two patients. The antihypertensive effect of acebutolol was moderate due partly to the absence of salt depletion. Inhibition of renin secretion by acebutolol was significant (4,7 to 1,95 +/- 1,10 ng AI/ml/h; p < 0,02) but did not correlate with variations of arterial blood pressure. There was no correlation between the antihypertensive effect of saralasine and acebutolol (R = 0,51). Plasma volume (n = 5) was almost always increased (47,15 +/- 5,4 ml/kg). No correlations were observed between the different levels of PRA, plasma volume, and the systolic and/or diastolic gradient. In conclusion, this study underlines the limitations of isolated peripheral assessment of PRA and the acebutolol test. On the other hand, the effectiveness of saralasine, a specific RAS antagonist, and the demonstration of the effective participation of this system associated with the usual increase in plasma volume, seems to liken coarctation of the aorta to the single kidney Goldblatt experimental model.", 
    "41": "A possible antimanic property of the GABA-ergic anticonvulsant valproate was examined by use of a double-blind placebo-controlled ABA design in 5 acutely ill manic patients. In 4 cases a marked improvement was observed after valproate medication whereas one patient showed no response. Seven further patients with frequently recurrent episodes of a manic or maniform schizoaffective psychosis, irresponsive to lithium prophylaxis, were chronically treated with valproate in combination with low doses of lithium (one case only with valproate). Over an observation period of 1 1/2-3 years none of the patients exhibited a relapse. It is proposed that, in general, GABA-ergic anticonvulsants possess antimanic properties and that the specific antimanic effect of lithium is due to a GABA-ergic mode of action. The possible role of GABA-systems in affective disorders and in organic types of psychoses (e.g.,porphyria-psychosis, delirium tremens) is discussed on the basis of pharmacopsychiatric considerations.", 
    "42": "Steady state ventilatory response curves to CO2 were taken in 8 normal subjects in control situations and taking clinical doses of propranolol, oxprenolol and metoprolol in a double-blind crossover design. Furthermore, the expiratory peak flow was measured. No effect was found of any of the beta-blockers on the resting ventilatory parameters, the sensitivity to CO2 or the peak flow values.", 
    "43": "Radionuclide measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) response to exercise has been proposed as a way to help identify patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Previous studies were done using an exercise bicycle or a treadmill and showed that patients with CAD do not increase ejection fraction (EF) to the same extent as normal (control) subjects. The present studies were done using a coaxial Gamma Cor cardiac probe. Because radiocardiograms (RCG) obtained with the cardiac probe require 1/10 the dose required for a scintillation camera, serial measurements could be made before, during and following exercise. Although 3 of our 9 patients showed an unchanged and 3 showed a decreased EF at the time of maximal exercise, 3 others were able to increase their EF, and in 2 this increase occurred concomitantly with angina. Thus, not all the CAD patients could be identified by failure to increase EF in response to exercise. However, looking at the period just following exercise, one can see that most of our patients with CAD maintain or increase LVEF during the first 6 to 9 min after stopping exercise; normal (control) subjects rapidly return to the preexercise value. The normal pattern is an increase in EF during exercise followed by a prompt return toward normal after cessation of exercise. Changes of this normal pattern of EF increase and decrease occurred in all except 1 patient with CAD, and consequently provided a better indication of the presence of significant disease than the response during exercise alone.", 
    "44": "In mice, quipazine has shown several behavioral effects: It antagonizes hypothermia induced by a high dose of apomorphine without altering climbing or stereotyped behavior; it antagonizes oxotremorine-induced hypothermia without altering tremors or peripheral signs; and it increases the toxicity of yohimbine. These three responses are considered to be predictive of an antidepressive action; in these three tests the effects of quipazine are inhibited by D,L-propranolol but not by D-propranolol or methysergide. Quipazine, in mice pretreated with pargyline, induced head twitches which were inhibited by methysergide but not by D,L-propranolol. Quipazine, in addition to its well-known serotonergic effects, seems to have beta-adrenergic properties which should be kept in mind when this drug is used as a pharmacological tool and which suggest that the beta-adrenergic system is implied in depression.", 
    "45": "Heart rate, systolic blood pressure and responses of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to guanethidine, timolol, minoxidil and phentolamine were monitored at 2, 6 and 12 months of age. All antihypertensive agents produced significant and comparable reductions in systolic blood pressure at 6 and 9 months of age, at which time systolic blood pressures were maximally elevated, but had very little effect at 2 months when pressures were only marginally higher. However, at 12 months of age, SHR maintained their response to guanethidine and timolol but responded less well to minoxidil and, especially, to phentolamine. Aortic strips of SHR contracted less than those of normotensive rats to both KCl and norepinephrine at all ages and also relaxed less to nitroglycerin. SHR aortic strips appeared to specifically lose the ability to contract to norepinephine at 12 months of age. It is suggested that a progression of change in responsiveness to antihypertensive agents exists for SHR. Furthermore, this progression will differ for agents with differing mechanisms of action and is probably a result of physical and/or biochemical factors which combine to alter the responsivity of SHR vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "46": "Assessment of ventricular function is important in diagnosis and as a predictor of survival in many cardiopulmonary disorders, and analysis of ventricular function is one of the oldest applications of radioactive tracers in medicine. A sequence of parallel developments in instrumentation, radiopharmaceuticals, and nuclear medicine computers has allowed implementation of accurate, sensitive, noninvasive techniques for analysis of both right and left ventricular function. Techniques, indications, applications, and information that can be obtained are discussed.", 
    "47": "A total of 178 patients having a diagnosis of left main coronary artery stenosis were divided into three groups as follows: surgical, Group I (n = 135 patients); operable medically treated, Group II (n = 21 patients); and inoperable, Group III (n = 22 patients). Groups 1 and 2 were comparable with regard to clinical profile, extent of anatomic coronary disease, and left ventricular function. Inoperable patients had a much higher incidence of prior myocardial infarction (especially anterior), more severe distal coronary disease, and markedly depressed left ventricular function. The hospital mortality rate for surgical patients was 4% (6/135). The late mortality rate, (median follow-up = 23.4 months) was 7% (9/135). For operable patients, the late mortality rate was 43% (9/21) at 28 months. In the inoperable group, the late death rate at 20 months was 59% (13/22). Actuarial survival at 24 months for the three groups was: 88%, 66%, and 42%, respectively. Of the nine patients who died in the operable group, two had less than 75% obstruction of the left main coronary artery and two had normal left ventricular wall motion. Although patients with higher grades of left main coronary artery stenosis and reduced left ventricular function are at greater risk, patients with less obstruction and good left ventricular function are also at risk and should have myocardial revascularization with some sense of urgency. The population of left main coronary artery stenosis is a heterogeneous one, and comparison of surgical versus medical therapy should exclude inoperable patients. The operative mortality rate has been greatly reduced in recent years (2% in the last 100 cases); this is attributed to careful monitoring in the critical prebypass period, aggressive pharmacologic treatment of increased preload, tachycardia, and hypertension, and improved aurgical technique, with emphasis on careful myocardial preservation. Adherence to these principles makes frequent use of the intra-aortic balloon either before or after revascularization unnecessary.", 
    "48": "The effect of timolol vs placebo on the frequency of anginal episodes, nitroglycerin consumption and exercise performance was investigated in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in 23 patients with angina pectoris. The optimal dose of timolol (10-30 mg twice daily) for each patient was titrated by exercise studies. Compared with placebo, timolol decreased the weekly number of anginal attacks and the weekly number of nitroglycerin tablets consumed, reduced the resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and product of systolic blood pressure times heart rate, decreased the heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and product of systolic blood pressure times heart rate at the onset of angina pectoris or marked fatigue, prolonged exercise duration, and diminished electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. Timolol is an excellent antianginal agent when prescribed twice daily, with the optimal dose titrated by exercise studies.", 
    "49": "1. The preventive effects against genetic hypertension development (GHD) of seven antihypertensive drugs chronically administered to the young SHRs from their 5th to their 13th week of age have been investigated. 2. While prazosin (20 mg/kg) and hydrochlorothiazide (6,5 and 25 mg/kg) are ineffective and while YC 93, a calcium-antagonist (10, 30, 100 mg/kg) exerts only a slight protective effect, captopril (30 and 100 mg/kg), dihydralazine (25 mg/kg) and atenolol (200 mg/kg) strongly prevent GHD. 3. Captopril and dihydralazine oppose GHD by inhibiting the progressive increase in peripheral resistance (PR) which normally occurs with ageing in SHRs. Simultaneously, these two drugs do not affect the cardiac output (CO) but increase plasma renin concentration (PRC). On the other hand, atenolol opposes GHD mainly by reducing CO and PRC while it simultaneously reinforces the progressive increase of PR with age. Captopril and atenolol, unlike dihydralazine, limit SHRs' myocardial hypertrophy. 4. After 14 weeks of treatment, arterial blood pressure (BP) of dihydralazine - and atenolol-treated animals meets control animals BP within 4 weeks whereas captopril preventive effects are still present up to 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Wit atenolol and captopril ther is after treatment discontinuation a good correlation between the evolution of heart weight/body weight and BP, which suggests that captopril could temporarily oppose the myocardial structural alterations which usually accompany GHD.", 
    "50": "The effects of a single oral dose of 40 mg propranolol on endurance time and on the maximum oxygen consumption were studied in eight healthy young men. They were running on a motor-driven treadmill (work rate from 80 to 150% VO2 max. The VO2 max and endurance time were decreased to an average of 10 and 30% of controls respectively. The relationship between the endurance time and the relative work load (VO2/VO2 max) remained unchanged after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The reduction of the endurance time following beta-adrenoceptor blockade is a consequence of the reduction of the VO2 max.", 
    "51": "This paper summarizes recent data on the existence of insulin nervous regulation by duodenal glucoreceptors which are connected to non-medullated fibres included in the vagal nerves. These glucoreceptors respond to intestinal perfusion of glucose or other carbohydrates, but other conventional mechanical stimuli are unable to activate them; therefore, they must be considered as true specific glucoreceptors. Their activation produces an immediate increase of insulin which precedes changes in glycemia. From bivagotomy experiments and from experiments which pharmacologically exclude the efferent parasympathetic or sympathetic fibres, it has been shown that this regulation is chiefly mediated by the vagal nerves. On the other hand, it was found that glucoreceptor afferents project on the hypothalamic nuclei (VMH and LHA) like the whole splanchnic and vagal afferents. The physiological importance and the role of insulin nervous regulation are discussed.", 
    "52": "In order to determine the effect of beta-blocking agents on secretions of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, 9 patients with renal failure were given single doses of propranolol (a blocker of the beta 1 and beta 2 receptors) or an equivalent amount of metoprolol (a beta 1 selective agent). Propranolol causes a decrease of plasma parathyroid hormone (p less than 0.02) as well as of calcitonin (p less than 0.05) whereas metoprolol has no effect on the plasma levels of these hormones. These findings suggest that parathyroid tissue and thyroid C cells have receptors that are exclusively of the beta 2 type which are modulating the secretion of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin.", 
    "53": "The activities of cyclic AMP- and cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase were studied in the aorta (freed of the adventitia layer) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). At the time of weaning (3 weeks of age) young SHRs were separated into two groups. One group was chronically treated with propranolol, 50 mg.kg-1 daily for 4 weeks (treated rats), with treatement beginning either at the time of weaning or at 15 weeks of age. The second group (non-treated SHRs) was used as control. In both groups we observed that the protein content per aorta but not the DNA content increased parallel to the organ weight. The enzyme activities were related to the DNA content of aorta. In non-treated SHRs, the phosphodiesterase activties increased with age, but there was a considerable lag of time between the marked increase in blood pressure that occured between 5 and 12 weeks of age and the increase in phosphodiesterase activity which started after 12 weeks of age. Prolonged propranolol treatment significantly decreased both blood pressure and enzyme activities when started at the time of weaning but had no effect when given to mature SHRs. Thus, the effects of propranolol on blood pressure and on phosphodiesterase activities were associated, whereas no correlation could be established between the age-dependent increases in blood pressure and in phosphodiesterase activities in aorta cells of the SHR.", 
    "54": "We have measured alprenolol binding and cyclic AMP production in erythroid cells taken from chick embryos incubated from 8 days to hatching and in cells from the adult. Beta-adrenergic receptor number and affinity measured by alprenolol binding are essentially unchanged in red cell membranes prepared from 8- through 17-day embryos. Receptor number was found to be half as much in the adult. Erythroid cells from embryos of all ages studied show stimulation of cyclic AMP production when incubated with epinephrine, and most of the cyclic AMP produced remains intracellular. Inasmuch as the cells from younger embryos can in fact produce cyclic AMP, the previously-reported lack of epinephrine sensitivity of cation transport in the red cells of younger embryos (Wacholtz et al., 1978) cannot be attributed to the lack of functional receptors or to an impairment of cyclic AMP production.", 
    "55": "The ability of endogenous myocardial catecholamines to participate in the development of myocardial cellular alterations during a short period of severe hypoxia (30 min) was studied in isolated, Langendorff-perfused rat heart preparation, arrested by a high potassium concentration (16 mM) and perfused in the absence of exogenous substrate (Table I). Tyramine, which accelerated catecholamine depletion, also increased myocardial cell damage as assessed by a higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and a more marked reduction in cellular levels of high energy phosphates and glycogen (Table II). On the other hand, under conditions of beta-blockade (atenolol), hypoxia-induced tissular damage was reduced (Table II). These changes could be related to modifications in the cellular content of cyclic AMP (cAMP) since cAMP was consistently higher during the first 30 min of hypoxic perfusion than in control normoxic hearts (Table III) whereas cyclic GMP content remained unchanged. Moreover, interventions increasing cellular content of cAMP (theophylline, dibutyryl-cAMP) also increased hypoxic damage (Table IV), whereas N-methyl imidazole which reduced cellular content of cAMP lessened hypoxia-induced cellular alterations (Table IV). It is concluded that cellular lesions developing during the first 30 min of hypoxia in isolated arrested rat heart preparation perfused without exogenous substrate could be related to intracellular accumulation of cAMP occurring under the effect of endogenous catecholamine release.", 
    "56": "A binding assay has been developed to characterize beta-adrenergic receptors on intact L6 muscle cells. The affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for the radioligand iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP) was the same in membrane preparations and in intact cells when determined by either equilibrium binding or kinetic analysis. The number of specific IHYP binding sites per cell was approximately the same on intact cells as on membranes. The pharmacological properties of antagonists indicated that the receptors on intact cells were identical to those on membranes. However, the beta-adrenergic receptors on intact cells had a 100-400 fold lower affinity at equilibrium for the agonist isoproterenol than did beta-adrenergic receptors on membranes. This low affinity of the receptor for agonists as measured by inhibition of radioligand binding in intact cells has also been observed in C6 (2) and S49 (3) cells. Our results suggest that beta receptors on intact cells after a 1 minute incubation was similar to the KD value for isoproterenol measured in membranes at equilibrium in the presence of GTP. After 1-2 minutes of exposure to a low concentration of agonist, binding of IHYP was no longer inhibited. These results suggest that agonists rapidly convert the beta receptors on intact cells to a state which has a low affinity for agonists. The affinity of the receptor for antagonists did not change during the incubation."
