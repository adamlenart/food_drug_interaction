The pA2 values of the S-(-)-isomers of befunolol and carteolol against S-(-)-isoprenaline, which were calculated from the shift of each concentration - response curve in increasing cyclic AMP levels, were significantly larger than those of the R-(+)-isomers in the guinea-pig taenia caeci, while the pA2 values of the S-(-)-isomers were not significantly larger than those of the R-(+)-isomers in the rabbit ciliary body. The pK1 values determined from the binding experiments were in good agreement with the pA2 values from the increases in cyclic AMP levels. These results suggest that the high affinity binding site of beta-adrenoceptors in the guinea-pig taenia caeci may be able to discriminate stereoselectively between the R-(+)- and S-(-)-isomers, while in the rabbit ciliary body there is no stereo-selectivity between the two enantiomers.", 
    "1": "The physiological effects of the sulfoconjugates of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and the 3-O-methylated catecholamines, metanephrine, normetanephrine, and methoxytyramine were examined with regard to their alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding properties and aggregation activity in human platelets. Sulfoconjugation of catecholamines resulted in the loss of both their competitive potency for [3H]yohimbine binding and their influence on platelet aggregation. O-Methyl substituted catecholamines showed attenuation of their alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding affinities when compared with those of the corresponding non-esterified amines. Unlike the free amine epinephrine, which stimulated platelet aggregation, the O-methylated catecholamine derivatives inhibited aggregation. Inhibition was dose-dependent and restricted to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated aggregation response stimulated by epinephrine (1 microM) or potentiated by subthreshold concentrations of epinephrine (30-300 nM) in the presence of subaggregatory doses of vasopressin (10-30 nM). Collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation was not affected. The hydrophilic beta-antagonist CGP 12177 displayed no effects. However, high concentrations (0.1 mM) of both isomers of the strongly lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol inhibited the actions of all aggregators by stabilizing the membrane. Such a nonspecific membrane interaction of the methylated catecholamines could be excluded because of their low lipid solubility calculated in a n-octanol-phosphate buffer system at pH 7.4. We suggest therefore that methylated catecholamines are biological alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists acting on alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulated reactions of human platelets. Whether this receptor antagonism is relevant to other human tissues needs clarification. Sulfated catecholamines, however, are wholly ineffective at this receptor site and may constitute a pathway to control the concentration of the active free catecholamines.", 
    "2": "Seventeen patients with effort angina, a positive exercise test and at least one stenosed vessel in coronary angiography were studied. Following a crossover blind-design, each patient received at random either 400 mg/day oral celiprolol or 120 mg/day oral nicardipine. A treadmill exercise test and 24 hour Holter monitoring were accomplished at the end of each treatment period. Both drugs significantly prolonged exercise time and reduced maximum ST segment depression at similar stages of control testing. Nicardipine reduced resting diastolic blood pressure a mean of 18 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) and also systolic blood-pressure 11 mm Hg (p less than 0.005) while celiprolol only reduced systolic pressure 10 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Resting heart-rate was lowered by celiprolol a mean of 9 beats/min (p less than 0.0001) while nicardipine slightly increased it. The double product at maximum effort decreased with celiprolol and increased with nicardipine. Six patients with 3 vessel disease continued having transient ischemic episodes during treatment with celiprolol and 5 had them with nicardipine. Both drugs were well tolerated by the patients. In conclusion celiprolol and nicardipine proved to be effective in the treatment of myocardial ischemia specially when coronary heart disease is not very advanced.", 
    "3": "Beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) agonists and antagonists are among the most widely used drugs in America today. This review highlights the importance of cross-racial studies in evaluating BAR effects because heterogeneity in pharmacologic response among humans exists. Clinicians and basic scientists in the drug development industry need to acknowledge racial differences in antihypertensive drug responses and prevent various racial groups from being underrepresented in clinical trials. This article reviews the influence of race on BAR responses with emphasis on blacks and whites. Information from patients with hypertension, healthy volunteers, and in vitro studies is presented.", 
    "4": "Acute aortic dissection is a devastating condition requiring prompt intensive pharmacologic management geared toward control of blood pressure and reduction in myocardial contractility (change in velocity/change in time). The treatment of choice currently is sodium nitroprusside and intravenous propranolol hydrochloride. During acute aortic dissection, hemorrhage may spread into the interatrial septum, extending to the atrioventricular junctional tissues, thus causing conduction abnormalities. Adverse effects of long-acting beta-blockers, including bradycardia, heart failure, and bronchospasm, may limit their usefulness because these effects persist for a long time after discontinuation. This may be detrimental, especially in patients with compromised cardiac function, bronchospastic disease, or both. We report a case of a 64-year-old woman with compromised cardiac function and aortic dissection who was successfully treated with esmolol hydrochloride (an ultrashort-acting beta-blocker) and sodium nitroprusside.", 
    "5": "Although current knowledge concerning drug responsiveness in the human heart is still deficient at both extremes of age, i.e. in the fetus and the elderly, new information is beginning to emerge. Pharmacodynamic studies have provided a fairly comprehensive picture of the appearance and maturation of the automatic receptors, and also of the emergence and development of sympathetic-adrenergic and parasympathetic-cholinergic mechanisms in the prenatal human heart. A timetable can now be drawn up for the earliest detection of intrinsic responsiveness to numerous adrenergic and cholinergic agonists and antagonists, and to inotropic and antiarrhythmic drugs in the human embryonic and fetal heart. Information on the antenatal cardiac pharmacodynamics of antiarrhythmics and inotropic drugs is mostly confined to some of the classical remedies, so that a systematic study of the effects of the various newer drugs is warranted. As legal abortions yield prenatal hearts only in very limited numbers, human embryonic and fetal cardiac tissue and cell cultures could also be used for such research under both physiological and pathological conditions, such as hypoxia or simulated ischemia. Since the sporadic data available on the transplacental efficacy of maternally administered cardioactive agents are encouraging, extensive clinical investigation into the pharmacological control of intrauterine cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure, based on new, high-resolution fetal echocardiographic techniques to monitor the success of drug therapy at the various stages of prenatal development, is also a stimulating challenge. In the elderly human heart, pharmacodynamically-based alterations in responsiveness to drugs have so far been conclusively proven for adrenergic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "The new alpha 1-blocker alfuzosin was compared with propranolol as monotherapy for hypertension in a double-blind, parallel group study of 8-week duration in 40 patients with essential hypertension. The patients (11 males, 29 females; mean age 47.8 +/- 2.2 years in the alfuzosin group and 46.6 +/- 2.4 years in the propranolol group) randomly received either alfuzosin from 2.5 mg b.i.d. up to 10 mg b.i.d. or propranolol from 40 mg b.i.d. up to 160 mg b.i.d. according to an individualized dose-titration schedule. The two groups were comparable with respect to disease history, cardiovascular risk factors, concomitant diseases, previous treatments and end-placebo blood pressure and heart rate values. Four patients did not complete the study, two patients in the alfuzosin group: one patient because of postural hypotension and the second one because of breast cancer; and two patients in the propranolol group: one patient for inefficacy and the second one lost to follow-up. At the end of the 8-week trial the mean daily doses were 12.2 +/- 0.61 mg and 196 +/- 9.82 mg for alfuzosin and propranolol, respectively. The antihypertensive effects of the two drugs were comparable. Upright and supine blood pressures decreased significantly with both treatments from the second week on (P less than 0.001 for all BP values). At the end of the 8-week double-blind trial, 83% of alfuzosin patients and 67% of propranolol patients were normalized. The two treatments differed significantly with respect to their effect on heart rate. Alfuzosin did not induce marked changes in heart rate: only a slight increase was observed. In contrast, propranolol caused bradycardia, more marked in the upright position. Palpitations, headache, asthenia and orthostatic hypotension were reported in the alfuzosin group. Asthenia and decreased libido were reported in the propranolol group. These data prove that alfuzosin has antihypertensive effects equivalent to propranolol and it is an interesting agent for the therapy of essential hypertension. It can be used as a first agent at doses between 5 and 20 mg/day with satisfactory therapeutic response and without relevant side-effects.", 
    "7": "For the enantiospecific assay of propranolol in biological material, formation of diastereomeric derivatives is one possible approach. The aim of the present study was the development and optimization of three analytical methods based on different chiral reagents: phenylethylisocyanate and the acyl chloride as well as the isocyanate that are derived from the fluorescent S-flunoxaprofen. Pronethalol is used as internal standard in all three procedures and improves the coefficients of variation significantly. After extraction from human plasma or urine, propranolol is reacted with one of these compounds in anhydrous organic solvents with addition of triethylamine. The diastereomeric derivatives are then resolved on an octadecylsilane column using mixtures of water and methanol with or without addition of glacial acetic acid. Good resolutions of the diastereomeric derivatives are found under these conditions. Conjugates are cleaved prior to analysis using beta-glucuronidase-arylsulfatase and assayed as parent propranolol enantiomers. All three procedures were suitable for analysis of propranolol enantiomers in biological samples in the lower nanogram range (1-2 ng/mL). A preliminary clinical study confirmed the known enantiospecificity in the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and showed high concentrations of conjugates with R/S ratios that were similar to those of the parent enantiomers.", 
    "8": "The cardiovascular effects of (+/-)-nebivolol, a potent beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, and its enantiomers, (+)-nebivolol (SRRR) and (-)-nebivolol (RSSS) in normotensive anaesthetized rats, have been investigated using metoprolol as a reference substance. The drugs decreased blood pressure and heart rate immediately after i.c.v. injection. These effects paralleled the beta-blocking potencies ((+)- greater than (+/-)-greater than (-)-nebivolol). Metoprolol induced a weaker hypotension than (+/-)-nebivolol, and a long-lasting reduction in stroke volume. As reported after i.v. administration, (+/-)-nebivolol and isomers by the i.c.v. route decreased peripheral vascular resistance following i.c.v. administration while metoprolol increased it. These effects are centrally mediated since cardiovascular responses to isoprenaline i.v. remained unchanged.", 
    "9": "1. Antagonist drugs were used to separate the purinergic and adrenergic contributions as well as the adrenoceptor sub-types involved in the sympathetic vasoconstrictor responses produced by electrical field stimulation in rabbit isolated ileocolic and proximal saphenous arteries. Blocking drugs were applied either alone or in various combinations and sequences. 2. Nifedipine attenuated vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation both in the presence and in the absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. However in the presence of alpha,beta-methylene ATP, nifedipine produces at best only a small attenuation of the vasoconstrictor response. 3. These results suggest that the purinergic component of the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation, at least in these tissues, can be antagonized by nifedipine, whereas the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated response is relatively resistant.", 
    "10": "The antidepressant-like activity of gepirone, a drug with a high and selective affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors, was studied in the forced swimming test in rats. The drug, administered intraperitoneally in single doses of 2.5-20 mg/kg, potently and dose-dependently shortened the immobility time. The anti-immobility effect of gepirone (10 mg/kg) was dose-dependently antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, NAN-190 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with the affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, pindolol (2 and 4 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and dopamine receptor blocker spiperone (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) and by the dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg). On the other hand, the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist, metergoline (2 and 4 mg/kg), the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (1 and 2 mg/kg), the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) and the beta-blockers with no affinity for 5-HT receptors, betaxolol (4 and 8 mg/kg) and ICI 118,551 (4 and 8 mg/kg), did not affect the anti-immobility effect of gepirone. The effect of gepirone was not modified, either, in animals with a lesion of the 5-HT system, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, 2 x 10 mg/kg) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 3 x 300 mg/kg). The results obtained suggest that the anti-immobility effect of gepirone is mediated by activation of 5-HT1A receptors, most probably located postsynaptically and that dopamine may be involved in this action.", 
    "11": "The anticonflict activity of ipsapirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, with high affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors, was studied in the drinking conflict test in the rat. The drug, administered in doses 1.25-20 mg/kg increased the number of punished licks, with the maximum effect observed after doses of 5-20 mg/kg of ipsapirone. The anticonflict effect of ipsapirone (5 mg/kg) was dose-dependently antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor, alpha 1-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor antagonist, NAN-190 (0.25-1 mg/kg) and by the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, SDZ 21009, which also has a high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors (2-8 mg/kg). On the other hand, the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist, metergoline (2 and 4 mg/kg), the 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptor antagonist, ritanserin (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin (0.25-0.5 mg/kg) and the beta-blockers, betaxolol (8 mg/kg) and ICI 118 551 (8 mg/kg), which have no affinity for 5-HT receptors, did not affect the anticonflict action of ipsapirone. The effect of ipsapirone was also not modified in animals with lesions of 5-HT neurones, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (PCA--2 x 10 mg/kg). These results suggest that the anticonflict effect of ipsapirone in the Vogel test, results from its interaction with 5-HT1A receptors, which are probably located postsynaptically.", 
    "12": "We have investigated the influence of cortisol on the beta-adrenoreceptor population of rainbow trout [Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum)] erythrocytes and determined what impact it has on the adrenergic responsiveness of erythrocytes in vitro to exogenous catecholamines. To do so, the erythrocyte beta-adrenoreceptors were characterized in fish with chronically elevated plasma cortisol levels (118 +/- 5.9 ng ml-1, greater than 10 days) and compared with shams, using radioreceptor assay techniques. The number of 'internalized', low-affinity receptors was increased when cortisol levels were raised, but the number of high-affinity, 'surface' receptors was not altered. The physiological significance of this response was ascertained by assessing the in vitro sensitivity (or responsiveness) of erythrocytes to adrenaline and noradrenaline (10-1000 nmol l-1) under normoxic (PO2 = 16.13 +/- 0.55 kPa, PCO2 = 0.41 +/- 0.01 kPa) or hypoxic (PO2 = 4.13 +/- 0.15 kPa, PCO2 = 0.43 +/- 0.01 kPa) conditions. Erythrocyte sensitivity to catecholamines, as determined by changes in both whole-blood pH (delta pHe) and intracellular cyclic AMP content, was greater in hypoxic than in normoxic blood. Although cortisol further enhanced the responsiveness of erythrocytes to catecholamines, this amplification in sensitivity was observed only during hypoxia. When the radioreceptor assay was conducted using erythrocytes from the catecholamine sensitivity experiments, results were consistent with initial receptor density data. An increase in surface receptor density was associated with hypoxia in vitro. This hypoxia-specific increase in surface beta-adrenoreceptors was significantly enhanced in the cortisol-treated erythrocytes, showing that cortisol had a significant impact on erythrocyte beta-adrenoreceptor dynamics in addition to the direct influence of hypoxia. This study has shown (1) that, by itself, in vitro hypoxia simultaneously initiates the movement of internal receptors to the cell surface, where they become physiologically active, and the replenishment of the internal receptor pool, (2) that cortisol increases receptor availability by increasing the internal pool of low-affinity receptors in the absence of any stimulus for receptor mobilization, and (3) that the sensitivity of erythrocytes to catecholamines is directly proportional to the number of high-affinity receptors present at the erythrocyte surface. Thus, we suggest that, under conditions of chronic stress, cortisol may pre-adapt the erythrocytes to receive additional physiological inputs that can ultimately enhance respiratory performance beyond that which would be possible in the absence of chronically elevated levels of cortisol.", 
    "13": "Previous work from this laboratory has demonstrated that the chemical activation of cell bodies in the caudal ventrolateral medulla of chloralose-anesthetized dogs decreased bronchomotor tone by withdrawing cholinergic input to airway smooth muscle. In the present study we determined the bronchomotor responses to microinjection of DL-homocysteic acid (100 mM; 25-50 nl) into the rostral ventrolateral (RVL) medulla of chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Total lung resistance was used as a functional index of bronchomotor tone. Microinjection of DL-homocysteic acid into the 20 sites located in the lateral aspect of the RVL medulla increased both total lung resistance [from 6.5 +/- 0.4 to 9.1 +/- 0.8 (SE) cmH2O.l-1.s; P less than 0.05] and mean arterial pressure (from 125 +/- 5 to 148 +/- 8 mmHg; P less than 0.05). Microinjection of this amino acid into nine sites located in the medial aspect of the RVL medulla increased mean arterial pressure (from 130 +/- 6 to 153 +/- 6 mmHg; P less than 0.05) but had no effect on total lung resistance. We confirmed in three sites that the increase in total lung resistance evoked by microinjection of DL-homocysteic acid was accompanied by an increase in tracheal smooth muscle tension. The increase in total lung resistance evoked by DL-homocysteic acid was not affected by beta-adrenergic blockade but was abolished by muscarinic blockade.", 
    "14": "In a multicentre clinical trial thirteen patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension were followed during at least six months while selfinstilling Pilogel (once daily) and topical beta-blocker (twice daily). After six months of combination therapy there was an average decrease in intra-ocular pressure (IOP) of 33.6% 9.5 hours after Pilogel administration and an IOP decrease of 23.4% 22.5 hours after Pilogel administration. With topical beta-blocker alone, an average IOP decrease of 15% was measured. Throughout the study we observed in six patients (46.1%) a superficial punctate keratitis which mostly spontaneously cleared. We did not see any serious side-effects after six months of combination therapy.", 
    "15": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of three standard antianginal agents, nitrate, Ca antagonist, and beta blocker on myocardial ischemia in patients with effort angina (EA) using ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring (AEM). Forty-three patients, mean age 57 +/- 11 years, with positive exercise tests were studied. AEM was performed for 24-hours, initially with the patients off all antianginal medication and then after 1-2 weeks treatment with each agent. Antianginal drugs used were long-acting isosorbide dinitrate 40-80 mg/day for nitrate (17 patients), diltiazem 90-180 mg/day for Ca antagonist (13 patients), and propranolol 30-60 mg/day or metoprolol 60-120 mg/day for beta blocker (13 patients). The following results were obtained: 1) The severity of ischemia (total magnitude and duration of ST depression) was improved with each three agent. 2) Although the number of total ischemic episodes was reduced significantly with each three agent, the number of asymptomatic episodes was reduced significantly only with beta blocker. 3) Circadian variation of ischemic episodes displayed a pattern with a peak frequency in daytime. In addition, nitrate and Ca antagonist did not reduce ischemic episodes in daytime (especially asymptomatic episodes), while beta blocker reduced both symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes in daytime resulting in change in the pattern of circadian variation of ischemia. Thus, it was concluded that beta blocker was the most effective means of reducing myocardial ischemia, including silent ischemia, in patients with EA.", 
    "16": "In our previous studies, we found that changes in T-cell subpopulations were induced by restraint stress. To determine how this influence on the immune system was mediated pharmacologically, we studied the effects of autonomic agonists and antagonists and hydrocortisone on T-cell subpopulations in C3/H mice. These agents induced changes in the subpopulations of T-cells and modulated the receptors on T-cells. These drugs, however, did not have the same effect as restraint stress. This suggests that the effect of restraint stress on the immune system is mediated by other mechanisms. We found autonomic agents and hydrocortisone to affect differently T-cells in various organs. In general, acetylcholine and hydrocortisone affected T-cells in the thymus and adrenaline affected those in the spleen. By the double staining method, the maturity of these T-cells was found to be affected by these drugs. Remarkable changes were as follows. Thy 1, 2-positive T-cells were decreased in the blood and increased in the spleen while Lyt 2-positive T-cells were increased in the spleen by adrenaline. Thy 1, 2-positive T-cells were decreased in the thymus and increased in the blood while L3T4-positive T-cells and Lyt 2-positive T-cells in the blood were increased by acetylcholine. L3T4-positive T-cells were decreased in the thymus by atropine. Finally, Lyt 2-positive T-cells in the thymus were decreased and L3T4-positive T-cells in the blood were increased by hydrocortisone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "A total of 112 3-week old Wistar rats were separated into eight groups: control groups I-IV (n = 62) and propranolol-treated groups V-VIII (n = 50). Propranolol hydrochloride (100 mg/kg) was present in the rats' drinking water until 26 weeks of age and growth rates of all groups were monitored daily until 53 days of age and thereafter every third day throughout the study. Chronic oral propranolol administration produced growth retardation (P less than 0.05) in both sexes that was reversible when treatment was discontinued. Organ weights were generally smaller in propranolol-treated rats; on the other hand, the ratio of most organ weights per 100 g of body weight was greater in propranolol-treated rats (especially females). The radio-immunological determination of plasma growth hormone showed increased concentrations of growth hormone in propranolol-treated rats (P less than 0.05), whereas hypothalamic somatostatin content was not significantly changed. The results showed that the retarded growth rate following chronic oral propranolol administration to growing rats was independent of changes in plasma growth hormone and hypothalamic somatostatin concentrations, and that retardation was entirely reversible when the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist was discontinued.", 
    "18": "14C-Labeled R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol enantiomers were prepared by direct resolution of 14C-labeled racemic carvedilol on a chiral HPLC column. Two enantiomerically radiolabeled carvedilol pseudoracemates, 14C-labeled R(+)/unlabeled S(-)-carvedilol and 14C-labeled S(-)/unlabeled R(+)-carvedilol, were reconstituted and administered orally and iv to separate groups of bile duct-cannulated rats to determine the biliary excretion of carvedilol enantiomers and the stereochemical composition of metabolites excreted into the bile. The respective biliary excretions of the radioactivity derived from the radiolabeled R(+)- and S(-)-enantiomers accounted for 41.4 +/- 0.9 and 41.5 +/- 1.9% of the oral racemic dose, and 43.7 +/- 2.4 and 40.0 +/- 0.9% of the iv dose. Oral administration of these pseudoracemates produced no enantiomeric difference in the biliary excretion of the radioactivity derived from the enantiomers, whereas iv administration did result in an enantiomeric difference: the biliary excretion rate of the radioactivity derived from R(+)-enantiomer was higher than that from S(-)-enantiomer. After administration by the two routes, two carbazole ring-hydroxylated glucuronides, 1-hydroxycarvedilol O-glucuronide (1-OHCG) and 8-hydroxycarvedilol O-glucuronide (8-OHCG), were detected as the major metabolites in the bile. The S/R enantiomer ratios of 1-OHCG were 0.59 for oral dosing and 0.43 for iv dosing, suggesting that the formation of 1-OHCG is selective for R(+)-enantiomer, while the S/R ratios of 8-OHCG showed values of 3.29 and 2.63 for oral and iv administrations, respectively, favoring S(-)-enantiomer. Since corresponding hydroxylated metabolites are rapidly biotransformed to glucuronides that are excreted predominantly in the bile, the stereoselectivity of these glucuronides presumably reflects that of carbazole ring hydroxylation.",

    "20": "Eighteen nondiabetic male volunteers, divided into three groups of six subjects, comprised the study. Hypoglycemia was induced by a bolus of short-acting insulin (0.15 U/kg body wt). Six subjects were studied in control conditions, six during alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine, and six during beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol.", 
    "21": "In the control group, there was an immediate fall in serum potassium from 4.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.6 +/- 0.1 mM at baseline + 15 min. After the onset of acute hypoglycemia, potassium decreased further in the control group, reaching a lowest concentration of 3.3 +/- 0.1 mM. In the propranolol group, the late decrease in potassium was inhibited, and there were no further changes in serum potassium. During alpha-blockade, there was an exaggerated fall to 2.6 +/- 0.1 mM at 30 min after the onset of hypoglycemia.", 
    "22": "The later fall in serum potassium, which occurs after the onset of hypoglycemia, is probably mediated by stimulation of beta-adrenoreceptors, whereas coincidental stimulation of alpha-adrenoreceptors opposes this fall in potassium and may prevent the development of severe hypokalemia in response to acute hypoglycemia.", 
    "23": "Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y- (NPY-) like immunoreactivity (Li) and catecholamines in the brachial artery, femoral vein and hepatic vein were monitored during physical exercise in a total of 19 healthy men to detect any local release from the leg and splanchnic region. In addition, propranolol (0.15 mg kg-1 i.v.) was given during exercise to determine whether beta-adrenoceptor blockade influenced the increase in plasma NPY-Li and catecholamines. Leg and splanchnic blood flows were measured using indicator dilution techniques and indocyanine green dye. Graded arm exercise was associated with elevations of arterial plasma NPY-Li (two-fold) and noradrenaline (12-fold) comparable to those previously found during leg exercise. During prolonged leg exercise a significant vasoconstriction and release of NPY-Li and noradrenaline was observed in the splanchnic region while no net exchange was found in the exercising leg where marked vasodilatation occurred. Administration of propranolol during exercise produced a clear-cut additional increase in plasma NPY-Li as well as in noradrenaline and adrenaline. It is concluded that splanchnic vasoconstriction during exercise is associated with a local release of both NPY-Li and noradrenaline. The additional elevation in plasma NPY-Li and catecholamines after propranolol during exercise is probably due to increased nerve activity and/or decreased disposal.", 
    "24": "Reduction of morbidity and mortality has been the aim of drug treatment for hypertension since its beginning in the 1950s. Its efficacy has been tested in many trials. An outstanding result of these trials has been their clear success in preventing stroke and stroke-related deaths and in decreasing the incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) and renal disease. A similar success has not been achieved in reducing coronary heart disease endpoints. Diuretics and beta-blockers played a central role in these studies; however, their adverse effects on lipid metabolism have been cited as a possible explanation for the failure of antihypertensive therapy to affect coronary heart disease (CHD). Recently, the extent and significance of these lipid changes has been put into perspective, and new insights into the role of carbohydrate metabolism and insulin resistance in hypertension have emerged. The same drugs which adversely affect lipid metabolism also adversely affect carbohydrate metabolism, and more is becoming known about these mechanisms and their role in hypertension and its sequelae. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs such as the calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha 1-antagonists do not share these adverse effects. It has become increasingly clear that effective antihypertensive therapy includes both the lowering of blood pressure and containment of the abnormalities that accompany the hypertensive state.", 
    "25": "Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring for long periods documents circadian patterns in myocardial ischemic episodes. The rise begins between 6 AM and 8 AM for patients with effort angina, the zenith of ischemic activity occurs at about noon. Similar peaks occur in the frequency of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death. Triggering mechanisms common to all of these events may include rises in catecholamine secretion, sympathetic nervous system activity, blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol secretion, and aggregability of platelets, as well as a trough in fibrinolytic activity. These coincident peaks and troughs would be expected to increase myocardial oxygen demand and decrease oxygen supply after a person arises in the morning. This vulnerable period merits recognition. Tailoring the dosing and choice of medication to prevent or reduce ischemia may be important if potential disease-activity triggering mechanisms are to be attenuated. By modifying triggering mechanisms, we may be able to modify the frequencies of adverse outcomes such as acute myocardial infarction and sudden death.", 
    "26": "Intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent retinal vascular changes were investigated in 33 eyes of 33 adult chronic open-angle glaucoma (COAG) patients by measuring major retinal vascular calibers at the optic disc border before and after mean (+/- standard deviation) IOP reduction from 35.3 (+/- 7.2) to 16.5 (+/- 4.7) mmHg for 11.2 (+/- 13.5) weeks. Both mean arterial and venous calibers were significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001 for each), from 87.8 (+/- 14.2) and 128.3 (+/- 20.8) microns at high IOP to 82.0 (+/- 13.8) and 121.4 (+/- 18.5) microns at low IOP. Arterial and venous caliber decreases correlated positively with magnitude of IOP reduction (r = 0.503, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.555, P less than 0.001, respectively). While the IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change was highly significant in patients 55 years of age or younger (r = 0.636, P less than 0.01) and in the overall study group, it was not significant in patients older than 55 years (r = 0.205, P greater than 0.1). Age seems to be more influential than magnitude of IOP reduction in patients older than 55. Thus, diminished IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change in the elderly may be one factor contributing to the higher incidence and prevalence of glaucoma in this population.", 
    "27": "The short-term additive effect and side effects of adding 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride to nonselective beta-blockers were investigated in 21 patients with ocular hypertension or early primary open-angle glaucoma. After a unilateral single dose application of topical 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride, intraocular pressure (IOP), heart rate, and interpalpebral distance were measured. The mean IOP of treated eyes showed a decline from a baseline of 20.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg to 18.1 +/- 3.2 mmHg at 1 hour (P less than 0.005), 16.5 +/- 2.6 mmHg at 2 hours (P less than 0.001), 15.2 +/- 2.5 mmHg at 3 hours (P less than 0.001), 18.5 +/- 3.0 mmHg at 12 hours (P = 0.02), and 19.2 +/- 2.9 mmHg at 24 hours (P = 0.2). No statistically significant change in the heart rate was seen. The interpalpebral distance of the treated eyes showed a significant increase (P less than 0.05) at all time intervals except 24 hours (P = 0.17). The authors conclude that 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride provides an additive pressure-lowering effect to nonselective beta-blockers for at least 12 hours after a single application, and shows promise as a useful adjunctive agent for short-term use in glaucoma therapy.", 
    "28": "Epinephrine is routinely used as a marker for intravascular injection during administration of regional anesthesia. The cardiovascular response of patients on beta-blockers to such a test dose has been reported to be unpredictable. We investigated this interaction by administering 15 micrograms of epinephrine intravenously to 6 healthy volunteers 39 to 48 years old before and after beta-blockade, accomplished by intravenous injection of propranolol, 0.04 mg/kg. Epinephrine administration caused a 20 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) increase in heart rate before beta-blockade but a 38 +/- 3% reduction after beta-blockade. The lowest heart rate recorded was 28 beats/min. We conclude that, in middle-aged beta-blocked men, intravenous injection of a standard epinephrine-containing test dose will predictably cause significant hypertension followed by marked bradycardia.", 
    "29": "Adrenergic receptors have been separated into alpha and beta groups, which have then been further subdivided. Agents have been developed that block each type of receptor with varying degrees of specificity between the sub-types, leading to differences in pharmacodynamic profile. A more recent innovation has been the development of multiple action beta-blocking drugs, ie, those not only blocking the beta receptors but also possessing a peripheral vasodilator effect that may be due to alpha blockade, beta-2 stimulation, or a vasodilator action independent of either alpha or beta receptors.", 
    "30": "1. Treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in vivo can alter adenylate cyclase responsiveness in the human heart. We have determined the effects of treatment with four different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in vivo on the responsiveness of lymphocyte and platelet adenylate cyclase in vitro in healthy volunteers. 2. Propranolol (non-selective, 4 x 40 mg day), bisoprolol (beta 1-selective, 1 x 10 mg day), and ICI 118.551 (beta 2-selective, 3 x 25 mg day) were tested as drugs without and pindolol (non-selective, 2 x 5 mg day) as a drug with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Adenylate cyclase stimulation by GTP, prostaglandin E1 and forskolin was determined before, after a 7 day treatment period and 7 days after drug withdrawal. 3. Neither treatment with or withdrawal of any of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists altered adenylate cyclase responsiveness. 4. We conclude that adenylate cyclase responsiveness in circulating blood cells underlies different regulatory mechanisms than that in solid tissues such as the human heart. Our data suggest that circulating blood cells do not always reflect alterations in solid tissues.",

    "32": "Four experiments were done to determine which receptor type(s) mediates the effects of third ventricular microinjections of four opioid peptide agonists on blood levels of glucose, free fatty acids, and corticosterone. Tests were performed in unanesthetized adult male albino rats having chronic intraventricular cannulas; blood samples were taken from the tail tip at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min postmicroinjection. In experiment 1, the agonists DAGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-N-methyl-Phe-Gly-ol), beta-endorphin, DSLET (d-Ser2-Leu-enkephalin-Thr), and dynorphin A-(1-17) (0, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 nmol/rat) produced three distinct patterns of changes in serum glucose, free fatty acid, and corticosterone values. Experiment 2 showed that the effects of DAGO and beta-endorphin were inhibited by prior injection with the opiate-receptor blocker naloxone (1 mg/kg sc) and that the effects of dynorphin were not diminished. Experiment 3 determined that dynorphin effects were also not diminished by naloxone given intraventricularly. Experiment 4 found that blockade of the mu-receptor by intraventricular pretreatment with the specific antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (20 micrograms/rat, 24 h before) completely abolished the effects of DAGO and beta-endorphin on glucose and corticosterone. The mu-receptor is critical to the mediation of the hyperglycemia and hypercorticosteronemia induced by the central administration of opiate agonists. These results imply that mu-opioid binding sites previously identified in central autonomic regions may be involved in the regulation of circulating glucose and corticosterone.", 
    "33": "Experiments were designed to examine the autonomic mechanisms underlying the decreases in blood pressure and heart rate elicited by electrical stimulation in the rat area postrema (AP). Vagotomy was found to significantly reduce the bradycardia observed in response to AP stimulation (control -123.5 +/- 23.5 beats/min; vagotomized -7 +/- 5.4 beats/min; P less than 0.001) but was without significant effect on blood pressure responses. Hexamethonium significantly reduced both heart rate (control -225.5 +/- 11.9 beats/min; hexamethonium -5.5 +/- 2.8 beats/min; P less than 0.001) and depressor (control -35.4 +/- 4.7 mmHg; hexamethonium -6.4 +/- 0.8 mmHg; P less than 0.001) responses to such stimulation, whereas combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade was without effect. The muscarinic blocking agent atropine also abolished both blood pressure (control -22.0 +/- 4.3 mmHg; atropine 2.8 +/- 4.4 mmHg; P less than 0.01) and heart rate (control -187.0 +/- 41.9 beats/min; atropine 8.8 +/- 2.6 beats/min; P less than 0.01) responses to AP stimulation. These data suggest that AP stimulation influences two separate neural pathways eliciting distinct cardiovascular responses. It would appear that activation of one of these pathways results in activation of vagal efferents to the heart and thus bradycardia. A second parallel pathway influenced by AP stimulation apparently elicits depressor response through actions on cholinergic muscarinic receptors.", 
    "34": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the subtype of muscarinic receptor involved in the action of cholinergic stimuli on synthesis of prostacyclin, measured as immunoreactive 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha), and cGMP in bovine aortic endothelial and rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells. Acetylcholine and arecaidine propargyl ester, a selective M2 agonist, produced a dose-dependent increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output and cGMP formation in confluent endothelial cells but not in confluent vascular smooth muscle cells. McN-A-343, a selective M1 agonist, failed to alter basal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha or cGMP synthesis. Acetylcholine- and arecaidine propargyl ester-induced 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthesis and cGMP formation in endothelial cells were attenuated by atropine, AF-DX 116 (M2 antagonist), and hexahydrosiladifenidol (M3 antagonist) but not by pirenzepine (M1 antagonist). The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin abolished 6-keto-PGF1 alpha synthesis but not the increase in cGMP formation elicited by the cholinergic stimuli. Our data suggest that the effect of cholinergic stimuli to enhance prostacyclin and cGMP synthesis is mediated via activation of M2 and M3 receptors located on endothelial cells and that the increase in cGMP production is independent of prostaglandins.",

State-of-the-art technology was applied, involving high-resolution gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, fluorescence polarization immunoassay, and radioimmunoassay. Samples from selected athletes were screened for five drug classes: stimulants, narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids, beta-blockers, and diuretics. In addition, samples were also screened for local anesthetics, corticosteroids, beta-human choriogonadotropin, and cannabinoids. During the 16-day event, 428 urine samples were processed and 3090 screening procedures performed. We describe the methods for analysis at the Olympic Games and present the results.", 
    "36": "The number of beta adrenergic binding sites (Bmax) in human lymphocyte membranes has been reported to decrease, remain the same, or increase with age. In order to address this issue, we used two highly specific beta receptor ligands with lymphocytes from healthy aged (range: 51-90 years) and young (19-39 years) subjects in two separate studies. Because depression can reduce Bmax, potential aged subjects were excluded if they had high scores on tests for depression. Bmax was higher in the aged group of each study (33% higher in the first, p less than .01, and 72.5% in the second, p less than .02); the results were similar in both studies. Antagonist affinity did not differ between young and aged groups in either study. We suggest that some of the discrepancies in the literature could be due to differences in age ranges used or to inclusion of depressed subjects in prior studies.", 
    "37": "Stimulation of the ocular sympathetic nerves is essential for the circadian elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) in rabbits. Adrenergic mechanisms that participate in this elevation of IOP around the onset of darkness were investigated using selective adrenergic agents. Unilateral topical administration of 0.0001-0.1% prazosin, an alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist, at the onset of darkness caused a dose-dependent reduction of IOP elevation. After treatment with 0.1% prazosin, the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) in aqueous humor was not changed, but the aqueous humor protein concentration was reduced. The increase of aqueous flow, determined by fluorophotometry, after the onset of darkness was not affected by 0.1% prazosin treatment. Treatment of rauwolscine, an alpha-2-adrenergic antagonist, or timolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, was ineffective in reducing the circadian elevation of IOP. Apraclonidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, with concentrations of 0.0001-1% caused a dose-dependent reduction of IOP elevation. Treatment with 1% apraclonidine caused a 70% reduction of aqueous humor NE, a significant attenuation of the increase of aqueous flow, and no change of aqueous humor protein concentration. These results suggest that both an increase of aqueous outflow resistance (by alpha-1-adrenergic receptors) and an increase of aqueous flow (not exclusively by beta-adrenergic receptors) contribute to the circadian elevation of IOP. Prejunctional alpha-2-adrenergic receptors may serve as an autoregulating mechanism to limit the excess release of NE and hypertensive spike in IOP.", 
    "38": "We investigated alterations in a beta-adrenoceptor (BAR) system after reperfusion following hypothermic ischemia induced by a high-potassium (18 meq/liter) cardioplegic solution in isolated rat hearts. Materials were divided into two groups: the reperfusion group (Gr-R, n = 5) with 40 min reperfusion following 40 min cardioplegic arrest (10 degrees C) and the control group (Gr-C, n = 5) with no ischemia as time-matched perfused control. BAR and adenylate cyclase activities in crude membrane fractions were compared. Results showed that basal, NaF-, and forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity did not differ between the two groups. The maximal enzyme activity in the presence of 10(-4) M (-)-isoproterenol was higher in Gr-R than in Gr-C, while the net activity stimulated by (-)-isoproterenol was 74% higher in Gr-R than in Gr-C. The [125I]Iodocyanopindolol [( 125I]CYP) binding assay showed that BAR density was 14% higher in Gr-R than in Gr-C, while the affinity was not significantly different. The IC50 values of (-)-isoproterenol for [125I]CYP binding were lower in Gr-R than in Gr-C and the proportion of high-affinity binding sites was higher in Gr-R than in Gr-C. These data showed that 40 min reperfusion following hypothermic cardioplegic arrest (40 min) resulted in significant increases in myocardial BAR density and maximal (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, and enhancement of BAR affinity for beta-adrenergic agonists due to the increase in the proportion of high-affinity binding sites.", 
    "39": "This prospective study evaluated the cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic effects of esmolol, an intravenous beta-blocker with an extremely short half-life. Twenty patients (aged 2 to 16 years) underwent diagnostic electrophysiologic studies at rest and during beta-blockade induced with esmolol. An initial dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes and followed by an infusion of 200 micrograms/kg per minute. The dosage was increased by 50 to 100 micrograms/kg per minute every 5 to 10 minutes until a reduction of greater than 10% in either heart rate or mean blood pressure was seen. The dosage required to achieve beta-blockade ranged from 300 to 1000 micrograms/kg per minute (mean 550 micrograms/kg per minute). Electrophysiologic effects included a decrease in the rate of sinoatrial node discharge and delay in conduction through the atrioventricular node. There was no effect on His-Purkinje conduction. Atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were unchanged. In six patients with supraventricular tachycardia, esmolol prevented induction of tachycardia in four and slowed the rate of the tachycardia in two. In four patients with ventricular tachycardia, clinical findings were improved in three and unchanged in one. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to near baseline values 10 minutes after the esmolol infusion was stopped. Adverse ventricular electrophysiologic effects were observed in two patients with biopsy evidence of myocarditis. No other adverse effects were seen. We conclude that the effects of esmolol in children are similar to those of other beta-blockers and that it is useful in the evaluation and management of pediatric tachyarrhythmias. The weight-adjusted dosage required to induce beta-blockade in children is larger than the adult dosage, and the effects of esmolol dissipate rapidly.",

Animals receiving no nadolol were studied concurrently. Nadolol treatment did not prevent right ventricular hypertrophy or elevated concentrations of plasma norepinephrine that occurred in right heart failure, nor did it affect the decrease in myocardial norepinephrine content and norepinephrine uptake activity, suggesting that the hemodynamic stress imposed on the right ventricle of dogs with right heart failure was similar regardless of the presence or absence of beta-receptor blockade. Resting heart rate, right atrial pressure, aortic pressure, cardiac output, right ventricular dP/dt, and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P measured 5 days after discontinuation of nadolol did not differ significantly from those without nadolol treatment in either right heart failure or sham-operated animals. Sham-operated dogs also showed no changes in myocardial beta-receptor or adenylate cyclase activity after nadolol treatment. However, nadolol treatment prevented the reduction of myocardial beta-receptor density and attenuated the decrease in the cardiac beta-adrenergic sensitivity that occurred in right heart failure.",

Blood pressure and heart rate significantly decreased after bisoprolol, whereas no significant change occurred in the diameter, the blood flow and in the vascular resistance of the carotid and brachial circulations. Pulse wave velocity significantly decreased in the brachioradial and the carotid femoral areas. The decrease in the latter was -1.6 +/- 0.8 m/s with bisoprolol and -0.06 +/- 0.80 m/s with placebo (p = 0.001). Brachial artery compliance significantly increased from 117 +/- 49 to 205 +/- 84 cm4 x dynes-1 x 10(9) (p = 0.001), indicating that the antihypertensive effect of beta 1 blockade is associated with an improvement in the viscoelastic properties of the brachial artery wall.", 
    "50": "The laminar distribution of binding to a number of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors was assessed autoradiographically in postmortem samples of area 23a in posterior cingulate cortex from 13 Alzheimer and nine age-matched control cases. Specific binding in all Alzheimer cases was compared to that in control cases, and the following alterations were observed: reduced muscimol binding in most layers; no changes in pirenzepine binding; and elevated cyanopindolol binding in layers Ic, IIIc, and IV. The Alzheimer cases were classified further on the basis of neuronal degeneration: class 1, no neuron loss; class 2, greatest losses in layer II or III; class 3, greatest losses in layer IV; and class 4, greatest losses in layer V or VI. This classification uncovered further alterations in ligand binding patterns. First, muscimol binding was reduced in layers II and III only in class 2 cases and in layers V and VI only in class 4 cases. Second, pirenzepine binding was reduced in layers Ic, IIIa-b, and VI of class 1 cases and layers Va and VI of class 4 cases. In spite of neuron degeneration in classes 2 and 3, there was no change in pirenzepine binding in these classes. Third, elevated cyanopindolol binding occurred in classes 3 and 4, whereas classes 1 and 2 had normal levels of binding. These results suggest that cases of Alzheimer's disease express heterogeneities in neocortical pathology which are reflected in the laminar patterns of binding to postsynaptic receptors. Reductions in muscimol binding to the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor had the closest relationship with neuron degeneration, whereas pirenzepine binding appeared to reflect a compensation in muscarinic receptors for changes in neuron densities.",

Moreover, captopril administered repeatedly (10 mg/kg ip, twice daily for 14 days) neither changed the density or affinity of cortical beta-adrenoceptors nor modified the nomifensine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats.

    "57": "The effects of cyclic 3',5'-AMP, ergotamine or propranolol on newborn rat liver were studied by using biochemical assays, electron microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Cyclic AMP enhanced the normal postnatal rise in the glycogen-hydrolysing activity of acid alpha 1, 4 glucosidase but had no effect on the maltose-hydrolysing activity of the enzyme. The results suggest that these activities may be due to different enzymes. Propranolol prevented the postnatal increase in the glycogen-hydrolysing activity of acid glucosidase and the breakdown of lysosomal glycogen, indicating that these phenomena represent beta-adrenergic functions in newborn rats. Ergotamine also inhibited the postnatal increase in this activity and the lysosomal glycogen mobilization. A reasonable explanation for these results is that ergotamine interferes with the action or formation of cyclic AMP.",

Computer analysis of competition experiments with isoproterenol and epinephrine revealed two classes of sites.

    "60": "It has previously been demonstrated that thymus exerts a regulatory influence on beta-adrenergic system during aging. In particular, it has been shown that thymus can correct the beta-adrenoceptor density decrease in old mice. In the present paper results of experiments are reported dealing with the influence of the thymus on alpha-adrenoceptors of mouse brain cortex. Both subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors are studied separately, using different labelled ligands. Results show that alpha 1-adrenoceptor density decreases in old animals, while alpha 2-adrenoceptor density does not change significantly. A neonatal thymus grafted into old recipients is capable of correcting the alteration observed in old mice. The differential impairment of alpha-adrenoceptors resembles that one previously observed on beta-adrenoceptors, where beta 1-type decreases in number during aging with a parallel decrease of adenylyl-cyclase activity, while beta 2-type remains unchanged.", 
    "61": "The ventilatory response to moderate exercise in hypoxia is potentiated in goats, decreasing PaCO2 more than in normoxic exercise. We investigated the hypothesis that this potentiation results from a ventilatory stimulus provided by increased levels of circulating catecholamines (norepinephrine and/or epinephrine), acting via beta-receptors. Plasma norepinephrine [NE] and epinephrine [E] concentrations, arterial blood gases and ventilation were measured in normoxia and hypoxia (PaO2 = 34-38 Torr) at rest and during moderate exercise (5.6 kph; 5% grade) in seven female goats. PaCO2 decreased from rest to exercise in normoxia (2.9 +/- 0.7 Torr; P less than 0.01), and decreased significantly more from rest during hypoxic exercise (6.4 +/- 0.6 Torr; P less than 0.01). [NE] increased in both normoxic (1.1 +/- 0.4 ng/ml; P less than 0.05) and hypoxic exercise (2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml; P less than 0.01); the [NE] increase in hypoxia was significantly greater (P less than 0.01). [E] increased in normoxic (0.3 +/- 0.1 ng/ml; P less than 0.05) but not hypoxic exercise (0.6 +/- 0.5 ng/ml; P greater than 0.2). Experiments were repeated following administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.). After beta-blockade, PaCO2 decreases from rest to exercise in normoxia (3.2 +/- 0.7 Torr; P less than 0.01) and hypoxia (8.1 +/- 0.7 Torr; P less than 0.001) were not significantly different from control. The data indicate that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation is not necessary for a greater decrease in PaCO2 during hypoxic versus normoxic exercise. The greater rise in [NE] suggests a possible role in ventilatory control during hypoxic exercise, perhaps via alpha-adrenergic receptors. However, recent evidence suggests that NE is inhibitory in goats, and that NE is unlikely to mediate extra ventilatory stimulation during hypoxic exercise.", 
    "62": "Beta-adrenergic receptor density on T cells from healthy humans is greatest on suppressor cells (CD8+, CD28-) and the effect of catecholamines, secreted by the sympathetic nervous system, predominates on this subset. The sympathetic skin response, a measure of sympathetic nervous system function, is absent in most patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). We measured beta-adrenergic receptor density on suppressor cells, cytotoxic cells, and monocytes from patients with chronic progressive MS and healthy control subjects. Control receptor density on suppressor cells was 2.8 +/- 0.3 fmol/10(6) cells versus a density of 5.1 +/- 0.7 fmol/10(6) cells for patients. Cytotoxic cell (CD8+, CD28+) receptor density was 1.4 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 0.9 +/- 0.3 fmol/10(6) cells in the patients. Monocytes displayed beta-adrenergic receptor densities of 2.6 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in normal individuals and 2.7 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in the patient group. CD8 lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor densities in patients with relapsing-remitting and those with stable MS were not different from control values, yet were significantly less than the values for patients with chronic progressive MS. We find that mononuclear cells from healthy control subjects and patients with chronic progressive MS proliferate in response to 200 units/ml of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) similarly. However, IL-2 treatment increased beta-adrenergic receptor density on normal mononuclear cells, but failed to increase it on mononuclear cells from patients with chronic progressive MS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Acid exposure of the duodenal mucosa is a well-known stimulant of the mucosal alkaline secretion. We have previously reported that a minor blood loss inhibits this secretory increment via activation of the splanchnic nerves. In the present study the pharmacological characteristics of the splanchnic neural inhibition of the alkaline secretion were investigated. Duodenal HCO3- secretion was measured by in-situ titration in chloralose-anaesthetized rats. Exposure of the duodenal mucosa to hydrochloric acid (0.01 M, 5 min) increased the secretion by approximately 60%. A 10% decrease in blood volume simultaneously to the luminal acidification abolished the secretory increase, as previously reported. Treatment with either guanethidine or yohimbine blocked the bleeding-induced inhibition of the secretion after acid-exposure. Neither prazosin nor propranolol did prevent such hypovolaemia-induced inhibition of duodenal alkaline secretion. The present results suggest that the splanchnic neural inhibition of acid-induced duodenal HCO3- secretion is mediated via adrenergic nerve fibres and alpha-2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "64": "Although many studies have characterized these receptors according to pharmacological criteria, this work represents only the second direct characterization of the rainbow trout beta-adrenergic receptors. Radioligand binding assays using (+/-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxy-propoxy)-[5,7-3H]benzimidazol-2- one ([3H]CGP 12177) and 1-[4,6-propyl 3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) were conducted to determine equilibrium binding times, ligand-receptor dissociation constants (KD) and binding capacities (Bmax). Furthermore, we assessed the influence of erythrocyte handling, suspension medium and endogenous catecholamines on Bmax and KD. Maximal binding was obtained when erythrocytes were handled minimally and maintained suspended in plasma rather than physiological saline. Washing and resuspending the erythrocytes, as well as the transfer of the erythrocytes into saline, significantly impaired apparent radioligand affinity and receptor density. Endogenous catecholamines, at levels considered normal for non-stressed animals, did not interfere with the radioligand binding assays, and thus eliminated the need to wash and resuspend erythrocytes. Based on the binding characteristics after intentional lysis of erythrocytes, it is shown that the total receptor population of trout erythrocytes can be estimated by propranolol-displaceable DHA binding, the density of high-affinity surface receptors can best be determined by isoproterenol-displaceable CGP binding, and the number of receptors located within the erythrocytes can be calculated from the difference between the total receptor density and the number of isoproterenol-displacable DHA binding sites. Each of these components must be considered when performing radioreceptor assays using these radioligands and this has significant implications for the interpretation of erythrocyte beta-adrenorecptor localization and mobilization.", 
    "65": "Beta-adrenoceptors in femoral and mesenteric arteries from 13-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were studied using radioligand binding assays and were compared with in vitro measurements of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation. The relaxant responses to noradrenaline via beta-adrenoceptors were significantly decreased in the SHR femoral artery when compared with the WKY femoral artery. However, under the same conditions, arterial relaxant responses to forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, were not significantly different between SHR and WKY rats. Specific binding of 125I-iodocyanopindolol to membranes prepared from femoral arteries of SHR and WKY rats was saturable and of high affinity. Neither the equilibrium dissociation constant of 125I-iodocyanopindolol, nor the maximum number of binding sites were significantly different between SHR and WKY rats. Similar results were obtained in the case of mesenteric arteries from SHR and WKY rats. These results indicate that the decreased responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in SHR arteries is not associated with alterations in beta-adrenoceptors and further support the hypothesis that a reduced function of the stimulatory guanosine triphosphate-binding protein is responsible for the decreased responsiveness to a variety of receptor agonists whose mechanism of action involves adenylate cyclase activation.", 
    "66": "The effects of drugs on amebocyte spontaneous aggregation and endotoxin induced aggregation were studied. N-Ethylmaleimide, ethylenediamine tetraacetate, propranolol, verapamil and lidocaine but not dibutyryl cyclic AMP could reduce the aggregating rate of amebocytes. The speed of degranulation induced by endotoxin was reduced by N-ethylmaleimide, ethylenediamine tetraacetate, propranolol, verapamil and caffeine. These results suggest that Ca+2 and c-AMP may play an important role in amebocyte spontaneous aggregation and endotoxin induced aggregation. The blocking agent of Ca+2 and c-AMP can also antagonize the aggregation of amebocytes.", 
    "67": "Oral glucose administration increases insulin secretion to a greater extent than peripheral glucose infusion (incretin effect). It also augments protal vein blood flow, hepatic uptake of glucose, and fractional hepatic extraction of insulin. The mechanisms for these various effects are not known but could involve both neurogenic stimuli and gut hormones. The present studies examined the effect of a non-nutrient drink, 1 g/kg body wt oral mannitol, on these parameters during an intravenous glucose infusion in conscious dogs. The dogs had chronically implanted Doppler flow probes on the portal vein and hepatic artery and catheters in the portal vein, hepatic vein, and femoral artery. After a 30-min control period, an infusion of atropine, propranolol, phentolamine, or propranolol and phentolamine was begun. Thirty minutes later, glucose (13 mg.kg-1.min-1) was then infused into a peripheral vein for 120 min with continuation of the atropine and adrenergic blockade. Water or mannitol (10% solution) was administered orally 50 min after the initiation of the glucose infusion. Mannitol, but not water, significantly enhanced the insulin response to intravenous glucose, as indicated by higher insulin concentrations in the portal vein as well as more rapid reduction of the plasma glucose. This incretin effect was significantly attenuated by infusion of propranolol but not by atropine or phentolamine. Mannitol did not increase portal vein blood flow or have any effect on the hepatic uptake of glucose or the fractional hepatic extraction of insulin. Thus absorption of nutrient is not necessary for the incretin effect but is for the increased portal vein blood flow and increased fractional extraction of insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The present investigation was undertaken to define the hemodynamic mechanisms by which the selective cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast (M&B 22,948; 2-o-propoxy-phenyl-8-azapurin-6-one) lowers mean arterial pressure (MAP). Anesthetized rats were instrumented with electromagnetic or pulsed-Doppler flow probes to measure cardiac output or regional blood flow, respectively, and catheters to record MAP, left ventricular pressure and administer drugs. Zaprinast (0.33-2.0 mg.min-1.kg-1) produced dose-dependent decreases in MAP (maximum = -39 +/- 6 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance (maximum = -45 +/- 5%) when infused i.v. The greatest reductions in regional vascular resistance were observed in the mesenteric bed, with smaller decreases in the hindquarters and renal beds. Cardiac output increased (maximum = 22 +/- 7%) during the infusion of zaprinast; however, heart rate was only minimally affected. These increases in cardiac output were still evident in animals pretreated with beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptor antagonists. At the lowest dose, zaprinast tended to increase maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure, whereas, at higher doses maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure was depressed or unchanged. Additional studies were performed to examine the effect of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor on the pressor and vasoconstrictor activity of phenylephrine and angiotensin II. The increases in MAP and total peripheral resistance produced by these agents were attenuated markedly during continuous infusion of zaprinast (1 mg.min-1.kg-1). These data suggest that zaprinast lowers MAP by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and by antagonizing the actions of endogenous neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems.", 
    "69": "Myocardial beta adrenergic receptors play important roles in physiology and disease, but the receptors have not before been portrayed. The beta antagonist, iodocyanopindolol (ICYP), was used to develop a scintigraphic method for depicting the receptors in the living heart. Labeled with 125I, ICYP bound firmly to beta receptors in the rat heart; the data conformed to a mathematical model. In vivo saturation kinetics indicated binding sites with two affinities. Inhibition of ICYP binding by beta antagonists of different potency and different selectivity for beta-1 and beta-2 receptors produced the expected pharmacologic effects. Inhibition by lipophilic and hydrophilic antagonists gave no evidence that ICYP was appreciably bound to internalized receptors. Fractional binding by tracer quantities of (-) ICYP and (+/-) ICYP demonstrated stereospecificity. Labeled with 123I, ICYP bound to the hearts of intact dogs so that scintigraphic tomographs depicted ventricular myocardium. Small doses of beta antagonists selectively reduced the binding of ICYP to lung enabling better visualization of the heart. Thus, 123I-ICYP appears to portray the beta receptors in the living heart, and the characteristics of binding permit the development of mathematical models and lay the basis for quantifying this receptor binding.", 
    "70": "Infection of beagles with an opossum-derived strain of Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc-O) results in features of early and chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, that is, increases in PR interval, atrioventricular block, and frequent ventricular premature contractions, ventricular tachycardia, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. These signs are not observed in animals infected with a canine strain of T. cruzi (Tc-D). To understand the biochemical basis for these early cardiac effects, we examined the beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase complex in myocardial membranes prepared from animals infected with either of the two strains. In animals infected with Tc-O (symptomatic), the maximum velocity (Vmax) decreased and concentration of agonist resulting in 50% of Vmax (Kact) increased for isoproterenol-dependent adenylate cyclase activity; in animals infected with Tc-D (asymptomatic), Vmax and Kact for isoproterenol were unchanged from control, uninfected animals. beta-Receptor density decreased by 20% in symptomatic animals with no change in affinity, whereas no differences were observed between uninfected and infected asymptomatic animals. A complex pattern of changes was apparent in the guanine nucleotide binding protein, Gs, in the setting of infection. Alterations in cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation patterns as well as immunochemical detection with anti-G alpha s antisera suggested a change in the biochemical nature of the Gs species and not necessarily a physical loss of this protein. Reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity in cyc- membranes demonstrated a decrease in hormone-sensitive Gs activity in membranes prepared from symptomatic animals without a change in activity demonstrable in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. Collectively, the results suggest that the depression in beta-adrenergic adenylate cyclase activity associated with symptomatic infection of beagles with T. cruzi occurs primarily as a result of changes in the Gs protein complex, most likely resulting in an uncoupling of the beta-adrenergic receptor from the Gs protein.", 
    "71": "The results presented in this paper demonstrate that in human neutrophils phagocytosis of C3b/bi and IgG-opsonized yeast particles is associated with activation of phospholipase D and that this reaction is the main source of diglycerides. The demonstration is based upon the following findings: 1) the challenge of neutrophils with these opsonized particles was followed by a rapid formation of [3H]alkyl-phosphatidic acid [( 3H]alkyl-PA) and [3H]alkyl-diglyceride [( 3H]alkyl-DG) in cells labeled with [3H]alkyl-lyso-phosphatidylcholine; 2) in the presence of ethanol [3H]alkyl-phosphatidylethanol was formed, and accumulation of [3H]alkyl-PA and [3H]alkyl-DG was depressed; 3) propranolol, by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of [3H]alkyl-PA, completely inhibited the accumulation of [3H]alkyl-DG and depressed by about 75% the formation of diglyceride mass. Evidence is also presented that phagocytosis of C3b/bi and IgG-opsonized yeast particles and associated respiratory burst can take place independently of diglyceride formation and of the activity of this second messenger on protein kinase C. In fact: a) propranolol while completely inhibited the formation of diglyceride mass did not modify either the phagocytosis or respiratory burst; b) these two processes were insensitive to staurosporine.",

    "80": "Glucagon increased alanine amino transferase (AAT) activity in perfused rat liver by about 90% over control. Propranolol, the beta receptor antagonist, abolished the effect of glucagon on this enzyme. Well known beta receptor agonists like isoproterenol, norepinephrine and epinephrine also increased the enzyme activity under identical condition and the enhancement was similarly abolished by propranolol. These experiments suggest that the effect of glucagon on AAT was mediated through beta adrenergic receptor. However, the interesting observation was that phenylephrine, alpha receptor agonist and phenoxybenzamine and tolazoline, two alpha receptor antagonists, increased the AAT activity like glucagon in perfusion experiments and the effects of all these three agents were also abolished by propranolol. Glucagon, when perfused with phenoxybenzamine showed some additive effect. From all these results we are proposing that in our system phenoxybenzamine is acting as beta agonist although it is known to be an alpha antagonist.", 
    "81": "The aim of this study was to examine the ability of the novel PAF (platelet-activating factor) antagonist WEB 2170 to inhibit active anaphylaxis in mice and guinea pigs. Previous studies with other PAF antagonists have given equivocal results. This study was designed to define conditions under which a clear and significant effect of the PAF antagonist would be shown. WEB 2170 could be shown active, at concentrations of between 1 and 10 mg/kg p.o. in a model of murine anaphylaxis, in which the mice were actively sensitized and also treated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol to potentiate the anaphylactic response. WEB 2170 was also active in guinea pig models of anaphylaxis (tested dose range: 5 mg/kg i.v. and 0.04-3 mg/kg p.o.), in which the guinea pigs were sensitized according to one of three specified immunization schedules and pretreated with low doses of mepyramine before antigen challenge. These results suggest that PAF has a role in active anaphylaxis in mice and guinea pigs. However, to demonstrate this effect in guinea pigs, models must be used in which the effects of histamine release are minimized.",

    "83": "The influence of norepinephrine (NE) on the acquisition of a conditioned odor preference and enhanced focal uptake of [14C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) within the olfactory bulb was assessed in neonatal rat pups. On postnatal day (PN) 6, pups were injected with either an NE receptor agonist (isoproterenol), NE receptor antagonist (propranolol or timolol), or saline before one-trial odor conditioning. The experimental conditioning group received a 10-min exposure to an odor (peppermint) and reinforcing tactile stimulation similar to that received from the dam. Control groups received only the odor, only the tactile stimulation, backwards presentation of the odor and tactile stimulation or neither of these stimuli. The next day, pups were either tested for an olfactory preference (Expts. 1 and 2) or assessed for differential olfactory bulb activity using the 2-DG technique (Expt. 3). The results indicate that early odor experience with either tactile stimulation or isoproterenol is sufficient to produce a learned behavioral preference and enhanced focal 2-DG uptake within the olfactory bulb. Moreover, an NE receptor blocker injected prior to training with odor and tactile stimulation blocks the acquisition of both behavioral preference and the enhanced 2-DG uptake. In Expt. 4, the effects of tactile stimulation and isoproterenol were further assessed. An odor paired with a moderate level of either of these stimuli produces learning. However, the simultaneous presentation of a moderate level of these stimuli paired with an odor does not result in an odor preference. An odor preference may be reinstated by simultaneous presentation of these stimuli, provided the level of each of these stimuli is too low to produce an odor preference when presented alone with an odor. These data suggest that exogenous NE and tactile stimulation are additive in their effect on learning. These results are discussed in terms of the neural mechanisms underlying reinforcement in infant rats.", 
    "84": "The present study was undertaken to identify protective drugs against aminophylline (240 mg/kg i.p.)-induced convulsions and lethality in mice. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) and valproic acid significantly prevented the convulsions, but were not effective in preventing mortality. Phenytoin, atropine, carbamazepine and atenolol were ineffective in protecting against convulsions and death. Ketamine gave partial protection against convulsions, but was not effective in preventing mortality. Diazepam (10 mg/kg) and atenolol (5 mg/kg) administered together gave total protection against convulsions and death. These results show that aminophylline-induced convulsions are relatively resistant to antiepileptic drugs, and that a combination of diazepam and a beta-blocker (atenolol) has potential as an anti-aminophylline agent.", 
    "85": "The pharmacological characterization of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes and the identification of two cell populations were investigated in isolated bovine mesenteric lymphatic vessels. The beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline, dobutamine and salbutamol concentration dependently decreased the amplitude and the frequency of spontaneous contractions and the amplitude of electrically induced contractions. The order of potency was isoprenaline greater than salbutamol greater than dobutamine. These effects were competitively antagonized by atenolol with pA2 values close to 7 with isoprenaline and dobutamine as agonists, and near 5.5 with salbutamol as the agonist. Noradrenaline concentration dependently reduced electrically induced contractions, an effect which was reversed to a slight enhancement after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol (10(-6) M). These results confirmed the presence of postjunctional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes in lymphatic vessels and provide the first indication of the existence of two pharmacologically and functionally distinct cell populations, one of which exhibits pacemaker activity.",

    "87": "Neutrophils exposed to fluoride ion (F-) respond with a delayed and sustained burst of superoxide anion release that is both preceded by and dependent on the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. The results of this study demonstrate a similarly delayed and sustained generation of 1,2-diglyceride in F(-)-treated neutrophils, over 90% of which was 1,2-diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol generation was not dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Conversely, in contrast to results obtained with other agonists, removal of extracellular Ca2+ markedly potentiated synthesis of diacylglycerol in F(-)-treated neutrophils. This effect was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the recovery of phosphatidic acid. In either the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, phosphatidic acid accumulated before diacylglycerol in F(-)-treated cells, suggesting the latter was derived from the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, the phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, propranolol, suppressed generation of diacylglycerol as it potentiated the accumulation of phosphatidic acid in F(-)-treated neutrophils. This effect was observed both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Moreover, high levels of propranolol (160 mumol/L) effected complete inhibition of diacylglycerol generation in F(-)-treated neutrophils with a corresponding increase in phosphatidic acid generation. Phosphatidylethanol accumulated in neutrophils stimulated with F- in the presence of ethanol. The extent of phosphatidylethanol accumulation at all time points after addition of F- corresponded to decreased levels of both phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, indicating that phosphatidylethanol was derived from the phospholipase D-catalysed transphosphatidylation reaction. The results indicate that F- activates a Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase D, which appears to be the major, if not sole, catalyst for both phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol generation in F(-)-treated neutrophils. Ca2+, mobilized as a result of F- stimulation and possibly as a consequence of phospholipase D activation, exerts a profound effect on cellular second messenger levels by modulating the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol.",

    "90": "To assess the long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, 222 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4 hours of symptom onset underwent assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide equilibrium angiography at hospital discharge and 1 year later. Mean EF at hospital discharge (46 +/- 12) was similar to that at 1 year (45 +/- 13). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis identified EF at discharge and patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge as independent predictors of EF change at 1 year (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Random assignments to invasive versus conservative treatment strategies or to early versus delayed beta-blocker therapy did not affect EF change during follow-up. No significant deterioration of EF was observed in patients with larger infarcts. However, EF decreased from 45 +/- 10 at hospital discharge to 39 +/- 12 (p = 0.005) at 1-year follow-up in a subgroup of patients with history of prior infarction. Thus, patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator early after onset of symptoms, appear to have stable LV function between hospital discharge and 1 year follow-up. The change in EF between hospital discharge and 1 year can be predicted from the EF value at discharge, patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge and history of previous myocardial infarction.", 
    "91": "The ability of insulin secretagogues to stimulate insulin gene transcription was analyzed in the murine insulinoma cell line beta TC3, which had been derived from a transgenic mouse expressing SV40 T antigen under control of the rat insulin II gene regulatory region. Glucose induced a 3-fold increase in the transcription of both the endogenous mouse insulin genes and the transgene. This effect was inhibited by D600, a calcium channel blocker, which also inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion in these cells. This suggests that similar signals may be involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin gene transcription. Agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP did not have a significant effect on the transcription of either the insulin genes or the transgene. Stimulation of transcription of the RIP-Tag transgene by glucose suggests that the 695-base pair fragment of the insulin gene regulatory region that is included in the transgene contains the cis elements required for response to the glucose-induced signal.", 
    "92": "Our previous studies demonstrated that propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase (PAPase) (EC 3.1.3.4) blocks the IgE-dependent mediator release from a rat mast (RBL 2H3) cell line. To continue these studies, we examined the ability of propranolol to inhibit the IgE-dependent or ionomycin-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium mobilization in RBL 2H3 cells. RBL 2H3 cells, sensitized with mouse monoclonal anti-trinitrophenol IgE (anti-TNP IgE), were stimulated to release both histamine and peptidoleukotrienes (LT) in response to a suboptimal concentration of trinitrophenol-ovalbumin conjugate (TNP-OVA) or ionomycin. Preincubation of the cells with d,l-propranolol (300 microM) significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited the effects of both TNP-OVA and ionomycin on histamine and LT release. There was no difference in potency for the different isomers of propranolol, indicating that these effects were not a consequence of an effect on beta 2-adrenergic receptors. TNP-OVA produced a rapid hydrolysis of phosphoinositides resulting in a time-dependent increase in mono- (IP1), di- (IP2), tri- (IP3), and total inositol phosphate production. Ionomycin also produced a rapid increase in total inositol phosphate production; however, this largely reflected an accumulation of IP1. Both secretagogues produced a rapid elevation in cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i); however, the effect of ionomycin maximized within a much shorter time frame than the effect of TNP-OVA. The effects of TNP-OVA on phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increase in [Ca2+]i were inhibited by propranolol over exactly the same concentration range as the effects of this compound on TNP-OVA-stimulated mediator release. In contrast, propranolol had no effect on the increase in [Ca2+]i and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to ionomycin. Taken together, these results suggest that PAPase/phospholipase D (PLD) (EC 3.1.4.4) activation may be a prerequisite for both IgE-dependent and ionomycin-stimulated mediator release from RBL 2H3 cells. Although other explanations are possible, the data further suggest that receptor-mediated, but not ionophore-stimulated, phosphoinositide hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i in RBL 2H3 cells may be regulated by a propranolol-sensitive pathway involving possible activation of PAPase.", 
    "93": "The two main causes of gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis are oesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). Rebleeding from varices can be prevented by beta-blockers, but it is not clear whether these drugs effectively reduce rebleeding from PHG. 54 cirrhotic patients with acute or chronic bleeding from severe PHG took part in a randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of propranolol in prevention of rebleeding from PHG. 26 patients were randomised to receive propranolol daily at a dose that reduced the resting heart rate by 25% or to 55 bpm (20-160 mg twice daily), throughout mean follow-up of 21 (SD 11) months. 28 untreated controls were followed-up, with the same examinations, for 18 (13) months. The actuarial percentages of patients free of rebleeding from PHG were significantly higher in the propranolol-treated patients than in the untreated controls at 12 months (65% vs 38%; p less than 0.05) and at 30 months of follow-up (52% vs 7%; p less than 0.05). Propranolol-treated patients had fewer episodes of acute bleeding than controls (0.010 [0.004] vs 0.120 [0.040] per patient per month). Multivariate analysis showed that absence of propranolol treatment was the only predictive variable for rebleeding. Actuarial survival was slightly higher in the propranolol group than in the controls, but the difference was not significant. Thus, long-term propranolol treatment significantly reduces the frequency of rebleeding from severe PHG, and may improve the prognosis of cirrhotic patients with this disorder.", 
    "94": "Esmolol is a new cardioselective beta blocker with unique pharmacokinetic properties resulting in a half-life of only 9 minutes. The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the hemodynamic and antiischemic effects of this compound given as an adjunctive to conventional medical therapy in 113 patients with unstable angina. Fifty-nine patients received esmolol and 54 received matching placebo infusions. Esmolol was titrated in a step-wise manner at dosages of 2 to 24 mg/min until a 25% reduction in the double product was achieved; thereafter, esmolol was continuously infused for up to 72 hours. Esmolol caused a significant and persistent decline in heart rate and blood pressure throughout the entire study period. Clinical events, such as development of acute myocardial infarction or the need for urgent revascularization, occurred in 3 esmolol compared with 9 placebo patients (p = 0.06). There was also a trend toward reduction of silent ischemia as judged by Holter monitoring (mean [+/- standard deviation] duration/patient/24 hours, 21 +/- 81 minutes in the esmolol and 35 +/- 128 minutes in the placebo groups). Esmolol-related adverse effects were mostly cardiovascular in origin and could be managed promptly by downward dose titration or cessation of drug infusion. Thus, esmolol appears to be a safe and effective drug for patients with unstable angina because it permits a large degree of flexibility in adapting the desired level of beta blockade to the patient's changing clinical presentation.", 
    "95": "The oxygen-dependent respiratory burst is a key neutrophil function required for the killing of bacteria. However, despite intensive investigation, the molecular events which initiate the respiratory burst remain unclear. Recent reports have suggested the agonist-induced hydrolysis of cellular phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) by phospholipase D may be an essential requirement for initiating or mediating the respiratory burst. We have investigated the effects of the chemotactic peptide N-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLF), the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and the polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic [20:4 (n-6)] and docosahexaenoic [22:6 (n-3)] acids in light of this hypothesis. Ethanol-inhibited superoxide production in response to 20:4, 22:6 and fMLF, in a dose-dependent fashion, suggesting an involvement of phospholipase D. The phosphatidic-acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor DL-propranolol completely inhibited superoxide production induced by both 20:4 and 22:6, and partially inhibited the response to TPA. In contrast, superoxide production in response to fMLF was increased by propranolol. fMLF and TPA, but not the fatty acids, stimulated phospholipase D as indicated by the accumulation of phosphatidic acid and, in the presence of ethanol, phosphatidylethanol derived from PtdCho. Extracellular Ca2+ was found to be an essential requirement for fMLF-induced superoxide production. However, responses to the fatty acids were dramatically enhanced under Ca(2+)-free conditions. Responses to TPA were independent of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Both fatty acids and fMLF, but not TPA, mobilised Ca2+ from intracellular stores, a response insensitive to the effects of both ethanol and propranolol. These results show that, unlike fMLF and TPA, the fatty acids do not cause hydrolysis of PtdCho by phospholipase D. However, the data indirectly suggests that the fatty acids may initiate the phospholipase-D-catalysed hydrolysis of phospholipids other than PtdCho.",

To study the roles of these domains, we prepared vectors encoding the rat LHR N-terminal domain alone (L- -), the LHR N-terminal domain fused to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the vesicular stomatitis virus-G protein (LVV), the LHR N-terminal domain fused to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the hamster beta 2 AR (LAA), and the beta 2 AR N-terminal domain fused to the transmembrane and C-terminal domains of the rat LHR (ALL). Membrane preparations obtained from COS-7 cells expressing the beta 2 AR or LAA bound the beta-adrenergic antagonist 125I-cyanopindolol with equal affinity, confirming the observation that the beta 2 AR transmembrane domain forms the hormone-binding site. Membranes from COS-7 cells transfected with LHR bound 125I-human choriomic gonadotropin (hCG). However, membranes from LAA-, L(- -)-, and LVV-transfected cells had low capacity to bind 125I-hCG unless they were solubilized with Triton X-100. The affinity of the detergent-solubilized receptors for 125I-hCG was similar to that of the LHR. We were unable to detect binding of 125I-hCG to ALL in the presence or absence of detergent. These observations suggest that, whereas the transmembrane region of the beta 2 AR is sufficient to bind adrenergic ligands, the N-terminal region of the LHR is required for binding of hCG. Although the N terminus of the LHR is sufficient to bind hCG, both the N terminus and the transmembrane domains of the LHR are required for receptor expression on the cell surface.", 
    "97": "Intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) was measured in individual pancreatic beta-cells from mice using dual emission microfluorometry and the indicator Indo-1 applied by a patch clamp pipette. GTP-gamma-S (100 microM) injected together with 0.3 or 3 mM ATP evoked repetitive [Ca2+]i transients with a frequency of about 1 per min in beta-cells kept at a membrane potential of -70 mV. The oscillatory pattern was unaffected by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (50 microM). When omitting GTP-gamma-S from the pipette medium it became evident that 3 mM ATP alone can induce oscillations. The results provide additional evidence for an important role of ATP in the ionic control of insulin release, indicating that such regulation may also involve activation of G-proteins.", 
    "98": "A method is described by which underivatized metoprolol enantiomers in plasma can be quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Samples are prepared for injection using a simple solid-phase extraction procedure which is essentially 100% efficient for all analytes. The metoprolol enantiomers are resolved using a cellulose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase and a hexane-ethanol-diethylamine mobile phase. Samples were tested for adaptability to autoinjection and found to be stable for at least 16 h after reconstitution in mobile phase. The automated method was determined to be precise and accurate for enantiomer concentrations as low as 10 ng base per ml and was successfully employed in a pharmacokinetic investigation.", 
    "99": "Presynaptic alpha2 adrenergic receptor inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) release is diminished in older animals [1]. To determine whether presynaptic beta2 adrenergic receptor facilitation of NE release is also affected by age, the effect of propranolol on neurally-induced NE release was examined in perfused heart preparations isolated from 6- and 24-month-old rats. The heart was isolated with the right cardiac sympathetic nerve and then was stimulated electrically in the absence and presence of propranolol (10(-8)-10(-6) M). NE content in the effluent was measured by an HPLC/EC methodology. The data indicate that there is a greater suppression of NE release by propranolol in preparation isolated from younger animals. For example, in nerve-heart preparations of 6-month-old animals stimulated at 12 Hz, propranolol (10(-6) M) reduced the amount of NE released by 34% whereas in preparations from 24-month-old animals at 12 Hz there was no significant change in the NE overflow. Like the alpha2 receptor mechanism, autoregulation of NE release by presynaptic beta2 receptors is diminished in older animals. Lack of presynaptic autoregulation may explain in part, the reduced capacity of adrenergic influences to control and regulate cardiac function in older animals.", 
    "100": "In this randomised double-blind parallel study, we compared the efficacy of labetalol and atenolol in a group of black (n = 33) and white (n = 34) hypertensives with uncomplicated essential hypertension after obtaining pretreatment renin profiles. After single-blind placebo (14-21 days), patients with standing diastolic BP between 105-119 mmHg were randomised to receive either labetalol (100-800 mg twice daily) or atenolol (50-100 mg once daily) to achieve a DBP less than 90 mmHg. Dosage titration occurred at weekly intervals for labetalol and biweekly for atenolol. The supine BP decrease with atenolol was -18/-14 vs. -6/-6 mmHg in whites vs. blacks respectively. With labetalol, it was -13/-12 in whites and -2/-7 mmHg in blacks. Standing BPs were: -19/-14 vs. -4/-5, whites vs. blacks with atenolol and -17/-17 vs. -19/-9 mmHg with labetalol. Neither labetalol nor atenolol was as effective in black compared with white hypertensives. The atenolol but not labetalol BP response was positively correlated with pretreatment renin values.", 
    "101": "We have previously described FSH receptor-mediated influx of 45Ca++ in cultured Sertoli cells from immature rats and receptor-enriched proteoliposomes via activation of voltage-sensitive and voltage-independent calcium channels. We have further shown that this effect of FSH does not require cholera toxin- or pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein or activation of adenylate cyclase. In the present study, we have identified regions of human FSH-beta-subunit which appear to be involved in mediating calcium influx. We screened 11 overlapping peptide amides representing the entire primary structure of hFSH-beta-subunit for their effects on 45Ca++ flux in FSH receptor-enriched proteoliposomes. hFSH-beta-(1-15) and hFSH-beta-(51-65) induced uptake of 45Ca++ in a concentration-related manner. This effect of hFSH-beta-(1-15) and hFSH-beta-(51-65) was also observed in liposomes lacking incorporated FSH receptor, suggesting that the peptide amides may act as ionophores or channel-formers. Reducing membrane fluidity by incubating liposomes (containing no receptor) with hFSH-beta-(1-15) or hFSH-beta-(51-65) at temperatures lower than the transition temperatures of their constituent phospholipids resulted in no significant (P greater than 0.05) difference in 45Ca++ uptake. The effectiveness of the calcium ionophore A23187, however, was abolished. Ruthenium red, a voltage-independent calcium channel antagonist, was able to completely block uptake of 45Ca++ induced by hFSH-beta-(1-15) and hFSH-beta-(51-65) whereas nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker specific for L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, was without effect. These results suggest that in addition to its effect on voltage-sensitive calcium channel activity, interaction of FSH with its receptor may induce formation of transmembrane aqueous channels which also facilitate influx of extracellular calcium.", 
    "102": "The induction of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA in the rat hypothalamus by systemic treatment with methamphetamine was studied using in situ hybridization. IL-1beta mRNA was expressed throughout the hypothalamus of methamphetamine-treated rats with no apparent signals in that of untreated rats; it was expressed in the paraventricular and periventricular hypothalamic nuclei, medial and lateral preoptic areas, lateral hypothalamic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei, premammillary and supramammillary nucleus, median eminence, and arcuate nucleus. The amygdala and paraventricular thalamic nucleus also showed the expression of IL-1beta mRNA. The induction of IL-1beta mRNA in these areas was suppressed by the beta-blocker propranolol (0.1 mg/kg, ip). IL-1beta mRNA-expressing cells were scattered in the hypothalamus and their counterstained profile was dense and small (5-8 mum) findings that suggest glial cells rather than neurons. The present results indicate that IL-1beta mRNA is widely expressed throughout the hypothalamus via beta-adrenoceptors, maybe in glial cells, following the treatment with methamphetamine and that IL-1beta might be involved in various hypothalamic functions induced by methamphetamine.", 
    "103": "The aim of this study was to determine in young, healthy men the relative contribution of pharmacodynamic factors inherent between two groups known to respond differently to hypertensive therapy. Black (n = 10) and white (n = 10) men received an isoproterenol sensitivity test before and after propranolol (0.1 mg/kg, then 50 micrograms/min). There were greater increases (twofold) in systolic BP following the 1.0- and 1.5-microgram isoproterenol dose (P less than 0.05) in the black group. During propranolol there were no differences in free (1)-propranolol concentrations between the groups; however, propranolol decreased resting heart rate in the white group more than in the black group (P less than 0.05). Cardiac index decreased less in the black group compared to the white group (P less than 0.05). Following the second isoproterenol challenge, there again were greater increases in systolic BP in the black group at both the 10- and the 20-micrograms isoproterenol dose (P less than 0.05). Our study has highlighted the importance of cross-racial studies in evaluating drug effects.", 
    "104": "The main objective of this study was to investigate how enzymatic lability would affect the extent of corneal and conjunctival penetration of a series of alkyl, cycloalkyl, and aryl ester prodrugs of timolol in the pigmented rabbit. Enzymatic lability of the prodrugs was studied in corneal epithelial and conjunctival homogenates, while their corneal and conjunctival penetration was determined using the isolated tissues in the modified Ussing chamber. The straight-chain alkyl and the unsubstituted cycloalkyl esters were hydrolyzed more rapidly than their corresponding branched-chain and substituted analogues as well as the aryl esters. The corneal and conjunctival penetration of all prodrugs, regardless of enzymatic lability, varied parabolically with lipophilicity. Moreover, the enzymatically more labile straight-chain alkyl esters penetrated the cornea and the conjunctiva more readily than the more stable branched-chain esters of comparable lipophilicity. Enzymatic lability is, therefore, an additional factor that should be considered in designing alkyl ester prodrugs with improved ocular drug delivery characteristics. Enzymatic lability does not, however, play as important a role as lipophilicity in the corneal and conjunctival penetration of cycloalkyl and aryl ester prodrugs.", 
    "105": "To study the regulation of mucous cell secretion, we have developed an in vitro cell model consisting of enzymatically dispersed mucous acinar structures (cell aggregates) from rat sublingual glands. Histological and ultrastructural evidence demonstrates that the cell aggregates are highly enriched in mucous cells, retain the morphological and ultrastructural features observed in intact glands, and undergo transition to an extensive secretory state when stimulated by 10 microM carbachol. The secretory responsiveness of the cell aggregates was verified in pharmacological studies. Carbachol stimulated secretion in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity (concentration causing half-maximal response = 0.3 microM) and was completely inhibited by atropine. Secretion was also stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide and substance P but not by alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists. Biochemical characterization of secretion during nonstimulated and carbachol-stimulated conditions (after preincubation in [3H]glucosamine) demonstrated that, in response to carbachol, cell aggregates synthesized and secreted mucins which were similar to mucin glycoproteins isolated from whole glands. Collectively, our results establish that the rat sublingual cell aggregate model is a viable and pharmacologically responsive cell system to study the regulation of mucous cell secretion.", 
    "106": "By studying the characteristics of BHR in subjects clearly defined as having asthma or COPD, it is apparent that there are both similarities and differences. These responses can be broadly explained in terms of present knowledge of the pathologic features and the mechanisms causing the abnormalities in the two diseases, and they highlight the important differences between the diseases. It seems likely that tests of BHR with histamine and methacholine cannot be used to distinguish asthma from COPD in subjects with a mild decrease in FEV1 and symptoms that do not clearly suggest asthma or COPD. However, a dose-response curve to methacholine is helpful. If there is a plateau, and the PD20 FEV1 is more than 4.0 mumol, it is unlikely to be asthma. If there is no plateau, a test with propranolol or SO2 may be useful to discriminate the two diseases. The similarities in the responses-especially those to histamine-explain why there is frequently difficulty in deciding the nature of the disease present in an individual subject. Is it important to distinguish the two diseases? In the introduction it was suggested that it is important for understanding these diseases, for prognosis, for treatment, and ultimately for prevention. It remains difficult to determine prognosis from any single test of bronchial responsiveness, and response to prophylaxis (stopping smoking, allergen avoidance) plus drug treatment over several years is probably needed to predict outcome in an individual patient. Finally, despite the valid hypothesis proposed by Orie and coworkers (2), it seems unlikely that studying the characteristics of BHR will shed light on the \"host\" factors present in both diseases that remain poorly understood.", 
    "107": "The influences of n-decylmethyl sulfoxide (NDMS) on the permeation of phenyl propanolamine, propranolol, acyclovir, and hydrocortisone through hairless mouse skin were investigated. Permeation of these compounds increased systematically with increasing NDMS concentration up to a limiting value for the permeability coefficient of about 0.1 cm/h. Permeability coefficients obtained with stripped skin indicated that, where NDMS has its maximal effect, the compounds diffuse through the skin as if there were no stratum corneum. Diffusion lag times of the test compounds through skin sections exposed to NDMS were far shorter than lag times in control experiments. The kinetics of NDMS action were assessed by pretreating skin sections for various periods of time with the enhancer and then assessing permeability. When applied as a 10 mM aqueous solution, the full effect of NDMS was obtained in 3 h of exposure and the effect lasted for at least 24 h. Treating the skin with ethanol/water (2:1) to elute NDMS after the pretreatment did not diminish its effect. Propranolol and phenyl propanolamine solubilized NDMS, presumably through the formation of mixed micelles, which had a profound effect on the permeation rates of both drug and enhancer.", 
    "108": "During the postanesthesia recovery period, surgical patients often exhibit an increased arterial blood pressure. Although these transient increases in blood pressure are usually benign, significant morbidity and mortality may result from complications of postoperative hypertension. The purpose of this study was twofold: to determine the frequency of postoperative hypertension in one particular recovery room, and to determine the efficacy of labetalol as an antihypertensive drug in this setting. This study included both a retrospective and prospective component. The retrospective portion involved review of 465 records of patients admitted to the recovery room at a large, private eastern medical college. Nearly 20% of patients admitted were found to have blood pressures in the range of our study's criteria for hypertension. Records were also reviewed for types of therapeutic interventions used to treat hypertension and determinations of their success or failure. The prospective portion of the study evaluated treatment protocols for postoperative hypertension with graduated intravenous injections of labetalol in 30 patients. Blood pressure was effectively controlled with an average of 25 minutes for all patients and remained effective for 24 hours postoperatively.", 
    "109": "Interindividual variations of debrisoquine metabolism was recently identified in non-human primates tested in vivo. The catalytical and immunological characterization of cytochrome P450IID subfamily was undertaken in hepatic microsomes from extensive metabolizer primates. The NADPH/O2 mediated metabolism of debrisoquine, dextromethorphan and bufuralol was similar to the kinetics reported in humans. The CuOOH mediated metabolism of bufuralol suggested that at least two enzymes are responsible for bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. Eleven compounds were tested for their capacity to modify P450IID function in vitro. Eight competitive inhibitors of P450IID6 in man were all and exclusively competitive inhibitor of P450IID subfamily in non-human primates. Quinidine, which is the strongest competitive inhibitor in man, exhibited the higher inhibitory potency in monkey (Ki = 0.75 microM). Anti-LKM antibody against P450IID subfamily cross-reacted with two proteins of 49 and 47 kDa, and sera containing anti-LKM antibody against these two proteins inhibited dextrorphan formation in vitro. These data provide evidence for catalytical and immunological similarities between human and monkey microsomes and indicate that the primate system could be a model for enzymatic studies of P450IID.", 
    "110": "To determine if corticosteroids would prevent beta-adrenergic-antagonist-induced increases in airway reactivity, we evaluated the ability of chronic methylprednisolone administration to prevent propranolol-induced airway hypereactivity to methacholine aerosol in the basenji-greyhound (BG) dog model of asthma. Initial studies included the measurement of lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) with and without propranolol pretreatment in 5 BG and 5 mongrel dogs. A single dose of propranolol (2 mg/kg) did not significantly alter airway reactivity in the mongrels. The dose of methacholine needed to increase RL by 200% (ED200RL) was 0.20 +/- 0.05 mg/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) in untreated and 0.18 +/- 0.04 mg/ml in propranolol-treated mongrels. In contrast, propranol significantly increased methacholine-reactivity in the BGs. The ED200RL for methacholine was 0.17 +/- 0.03 mg/ml in untreated and 0.05 +/- 0.02 mg/ml (P less than 0.05) in propranolol-treated BG dogs. Following the initial studies, the 5 BG dogs were given methylprednisolone (2 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 4 weeks, after which time propranolol no longer increased methylacholine reactivity in the BGs. The ED200RL was 0.16 +/- 0.03 mg/ml after 4 weeks of methylprednisolone and 0.22 +/- 0.06 mg/ml after propranolol administration in the BGs given 4 weeks of methylprednisolone treatment. The attenuation of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction by corticosteroids may be a clinically useful intervention in asthmatic patients receiving beta-adrenergic antagonists in the perioperative period. However, further studies are needed to define the effective dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy that is needed."
