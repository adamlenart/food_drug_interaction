    "0": "In 14 patients with essential hypertension, the response of the heart rate and blood pressure to infusion of norepinephrine and epinephrine separately while off (control period) or on therapy with beta-adrenergic receptor blockade was examined. By titrating dosage against the response of blood pressure and pulse rate, propranolol hydrochloride was administered orally at 160 mg/day in four divided doses. There was a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and in pulse rate during propranolol therapy, whereas diastolic blood pressure decreased but not significantly so. Normal blood pressure (140/90 mm /g or less) was attained only in five patients. The infusion of epinephrine and then norepinephrine produced a significant increase in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure during propranolol therapy, but the magnitude of the rise was significantly greater than that attained in the control period only during epinephrine infusion. We conclude that the transient hypertensive episodes which have been observed during offive visits in some hypertensive patients treated with propranolol are due mainly to release of epinephrine.", 
    "1": "On 51 of 53 occasions, sudden withdrawal of propranolol from patients with angina pectoris produced no substantial adverse effects. Two patients experienced a recurrence of unstable angina with one man sustaining a fatal myocardial infarction ten days after propranolol withdrawal. These observations suggest that patients with previous unstable angina may be dependent upon beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Sudden cessation of propranolol for short periods may be preferable to tapering the dosage if prolonged periods of sub-optimal beta-adrenoceptor blockade are to be avoided.", 
    "2": "Anxiety and grave apprehension have been supposed to increase cerebral metabolism, and it has earlier been suggested that intravenous infusion of adrenaline may increase cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMR02). In an experimental model on rats, it could be shown that immobilisation stress increased CBF and CMR02 after 5 min (about 150% of control values) and 30 min (about 190% of control values). By previous adrenalectomy or by administration of a beta-receptor blocker (propranolol, 1.4 mg/kg) the changes in CBF and CMR02 could be prevented. It is concluded that the excessive increase in CBF and CMR02 was mediated via release of catecholamines from the adrenal glands.", 
    "3": "5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) produces a positive chronotropic effect in the isolated atrium of the hamster. The characterization of this effect using reserpine pretreatment, propranolol, pargyline, 6-hydroxydopamine or the combination of some of those drugs enable us to conclude that serotonin is an amine of mixed action in the isolated atrium of the hamster, that is, its positive chronotropic effect has a direct component, which is obtained with lower concentrations of agonist and an indirect component through the liberation of endogenous noradrenaline from the sympathetic nerve terminals. The highest concentrations of serotonin are responsible of that component. Pargyline potentiates the indirect component of 5-HT, because inhibition of intraneuronal monoamine oxidase (MAO) avoids the degradation of the noradrenaline released, but it does not potentiate the direct component, indicating that postsynaptic cardiac MAO has little importance in the metabolism of serotonin administered exogenously.", 
    "4": "An open multicentre trial was carried out in 13 hypertensive patients, who had responded satisfactorily to and been stabilized on treatment with 400 mg acebutolol daily in divided doses, to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of the same daily dosage given as a single morning dose. On admission, patients were changed over immediately to the new dosage regimen and continued on it for 3 months. Blood pressure and pulse rate measurements were made on the day before change over and then at the end of each month. The results indicated that once-a-day 400 mg acebutolol gave satisfactory continued control of blood pressure. Side-effects reported spontaneously by the patient, observed by the physician, and elicited in response to a questionnaire, diminished in incidence and severity in most of the patients during the trial period.", 
    "5": "In a patient with coarctation of the aorta, blood pressure and heart rate were measured during graded exercise on a bicycle ergometer. After no treatment, and after oral hydrallazine, exercise produced large rises in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and in heart rate. During exercise after oral propranolol, systolic and diastolic pressures did not increase, and there was a less marked tachycardia. These results suggest that propranolol should be used to minimize the dangers of elevated blood pressure associated with exercise in patients with coarctation.", 
    "6": "Severe renin-mediated hypertension was noted in 2 children as a result of selective renal damage from vesicoureteral reflux during the early years of life. In each case the reflux had been corrected successfully long before hypertension developed. In 1 case the late damage involved only 1 kidney and nephrectomy resulted in immediate relief of the hypertension. In the second case, even though both kidneys showed segmental scarring from calicectasis and chronic pyelonephritis, removal of the atrophied lower pole of 1 kidney made hypertension amenable to medical treatment and reduced excessive renin output to a fraction of the original high levels. The mechanism of renin-mediated hypertension in kidneys with segmental scars of chronic pyelonephritis is believed to be ischemia of the relatively normal renal cortex in proximity to areas of interstitial fibrosis, within which are tortuous interlobular and smaller arterioles with severe intimal thickening. Hypertrophy of normal renal segment occurs in young patients with segmental chronic pyelonephritis. To accommodate this enlargement the original calix develops an extension or elongation readily distinguishable from other dilated calices.", 
    "7": "Local blood flow was measured in renal cortex (at 1 mm below cortical surface) by means of the hydrogen clearance method in urethanized rats. Recording of blood pressure from femoral artery was performed. The blood flow autoregulation was studied by plotting renal cortical vascular resistance (R.C.V.R.) as a function of arterial pressure in all the experimental conditions. R.C.V.R. was calculated as arterial pressure/blood flow ratio. In control animals R.C.V.R. was linearly correlated to arterial pressure; this implies the existence of autoregulation in the studied zone. In animals pretreated with guanethidine or propranolol, and in animals injected with propranolol immediately before the experiment, the increase of arterial pressure was not followed by an increase in R.C.V.R.; this implies that autoregulation was absent. In animals pretreated with reserpine the increase of arterial pressure was not followed by a significant increase in R.C.V.R., although a tendency to increase was detected. It is suggested that the impairment of autoregulation induced by guanethidine, propranolol or reserpine may be due to an inhibition of renin release. The results obtained with guanethidine and reserpine may be partially attributable to a decrease in adrenergic activity on the vascular smooth muscle of the studied zone, although other mechanisms cannot be discarded.", 
    "8": "Ethylephrine, a sympathomimetic amine which belongs to the phenolamine group, was assayed on the driven left rat atrium. The frequency response curve was performed for norepinephrine and ethylephrine. The maxima was attained for both compounds at 1 Hz. The agonist under study has an inotropic action less potent than the classical catecholamines. Propranolol (10(-8) and 10(-7) M) produced a parallel shift to the right in the log dose-response curves of ethylephrine with no decrease in the maximal response, indicating that the antagonism was competitive. In the presence of cocaine or with reserpine-pretreatment the sensitivity of the preparation to the amine did not vary. The alpha-blocker, phentolamine (10(-8) to 3.10(-5) M) did not possess an inotropic effect per se. In contrast, phentolamine, delivered to the bath beforehand, did not block the agonist. However at 10(-8) and 10(-7) M increase the maximal response both in normal and reserpinized preparations. It is suggested that ethylephrine is a direct inotropic preparation. It is suggested that ethylephrine is a direct inotropic agent on the driven left rat atrium and its effects are mediated by beta-receptors. The results also indicate the lack of evidence that ethylephrine has any action on the alpha-receptors.", 
    "9": "Arterial pressure was continuously recorded for 24--48 h in 3 normotensive subjects and in 60 hypertensive patients. The greatest variations occurred in those with labile, mild or moderate hypertension compared to those with severe hypertension or normal blood pressure. Atenolol (100-200 mg) administered once or twice daily produced a significant reduction of arterial pressure and a smaller response to the cold pressor test, hand grip and step test in patients with established hypertension, but little change in those with labile hypertension. The evening dose was not followed by a decrease in pressure greater than that observed without treatment, but determined a smaller rise on awaking.", 
    "10": "The antiarrhythmic effect of PGE2 as compared with the adrenergic beta-receptor blocking substance propranolol and the unspecific antiarrhythmic agent ajmaline was examanined on catecholamine-induced arrhythmias of the guinea-pig after preliminary sensibilisation by means of chloroform. Prophylactic administration of the tested substances resulted in a decrease in severity of arrhythmia by 91% after propranolol, by 37% after PGE2 and by 34% after ajmaline. Onset and duration of the arrhythmia were affected only to a negligible degree. The possible mode of action is still under discussion.", 
    "11": "Five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study. They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine. Treatment with propanolol administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg. Chronic oral administration of propranolol (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed. In 1 patient, marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn. It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed. Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time. Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therapy. The studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "12": "1. Propranolol was administered to groups of mature rats before and during the development of renal hypertension induced by ligation of the aorta between the renal arteries. 2. At a dose 10 mumol (3 mg) of propranolol/kg, administered by intraperitoneal injection, the onset and severity of hypertension were not affected, although plasma renin concentration was significantly lower than in the untreated hypertensive rats in the first 5 days after the operation. 3. With 200 mumol (60 mg) of propranolol/kg, administered in the drinking water, peak blood pressure 5 days after aortic ligation was lower than in the untreated control rats, but plasma renin concentration was no lower than with the smaller dose. 4. The development of severe hypertension despite reduction in plasma renin concentration on the low dose of propranolol suggests the participation of renal vasopressor factors other than renin in this model. 5. A higher dose of propranolol reduced the rise in plasma concentration to an equal extent but the rise of blood pressure at 5 days was also reduced, which supports this concept.", 
    "13": "Electrical stimulation of the fastigial nucleus produced a pressor response with cardiac arrhythmia in cats. The arrhythmic response was abolished by tetrodotoxin (3 microgram/kg, i.v.), atropine (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) or vagotomy, and suppressed slightly by propranolol or verapamil (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, i.v.). It was not abolished by the carotid sinus nerve section. The effects of the drug suggest that arrhythmia seems to be due to an interplay of sympathetic and parasympathetic influences with the latter effect predominating. The pressor and arrhythmic response to stimulation of the fastigial nucleus was increased by stimulation, and decreased by lesion of the posterior hypothalamus, indicating that some connection between the two structures exists.", 
    "14": "Reference is made to the importance of functional diagnosis of the autonomic nervous system in cattle, and a concept is described by which higher methodological reliability should be obtainable for intra-organic diagnosis of sympathetic nerve activity. What is needed, among others, is to eliminate the autonomous cardiac effect through pharmacological blockade by means of the parasympathetic atropine and the beta-receptor blocker propanolol. The beta-adrenergic substance isoprenaline, required to estimate propranolol blocking action upon the beta-adrenegic receptors, then was injected through indwelling catheters to the external jugular veins of cattle. The doses were between 50 microgram and 560 microgram. Isoprenaline doses between 200 microgram and 250 microgram were established as maximum doses by electrocardiographic examination, determination of heart rate, and clinical observation. Such maximum isoprenaline doses were found to be suitable for checking the extent to which beta-adrenergic blockade of the heart has been caused by beta-receptor blockers. However, sub-maximum isoprenaline doses of something between 100 microgram and 150 microgram should be used to establish the extent to which beta-receptors have caused relaxation of smooth musculature.", 
    "15": "The effect of small intravenous doses of practolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on the circulatory response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, when administered with atropine (0.01 mg/kg b.w.) prior to anaesthesia was studied in 39 patients with and without cardiovascular disease. Practolol diminished significantly the rise of mean arterial pressure and pulse rate affected by laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation when performed under thiopentone-succinylcholine anaesthesia. Arrhythmias were also less frequent through the statistical significance could not be ascertained in this small series. The small practolol dose used had no adverse circulatory effects. It is suggested that the administration of a small prophylactic dose of practolol is useful in preventing the excessive cardiovascular response due to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.", 
    "16": "The blood pressure of 18 patients with refractory hypertension was controlled by treatment with Minoxidil in combination with Propranolol and diuretics. Ten of these patients were studied prospectively and were found not to have deterioration of carbohydrate tolerance while on Minoxidil therapy. Pericardial effusions occurred in 40% of the patients, including 2 with normal renal function. This untoward effect of prolonged use Minoxidil warrants further study.", 
    "17": "The effect of nifedipine on effort angina was investigated by means of exercise tests with bycicle ergometer and compared, in the same patients, with the effects of a nitroderivative and a betablocking agent. Five patients with stable effort angina entered the study, after an hemodynamic and contrasto-graphic control. According to the protocol of a latin square 5 X 5, all the patients received in a random sequence the following treatments: placebo, 1 c. orally; isosorbide dinitrate, 5 mg sublingually; propranolol, 40 mg orally; nifedipine, 10 mg sublingually; nifedipine, 10 mg orally. No significant change of any of the considered parameters was observed after the placebo. Isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine produced significant increases of the duration of work before appearance of pain and EKG positivity, and of total work performed before anginal pain. Only the duration of work before EKG positivity was improved by propranolol. The comparisons between treatments showed no significant difference of the effects of the administered doses of isosorbide dinitrate and nifedipine. The improvements observed after propranolol were significantly lower than that observed after isosorbide dinitrate and oral nifedipine. On the basis of the observed changes of cardiac rate, maximal arterial pressure, ejection time index and triple product, the authors evaluate the possible mechanism of action of nifedipine.", 
    "18": "Brief occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery in the cat produces increases in systemic pressure and in muscle blood flow. Capillary filtration in muscle, measured during occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, exceeds that of the controls. Propranolol, which blocks the evoked increase in muscle blood flow, reduces capillary filtration during occlusion to less than the control. Cutting the mesenteric nerve returns capillary filtration to the control level. Passive redistribution of blood, such as might follow occlusion of a large vascular region, is not the basis for the evoked changes in muscle hemodynamics. They are abolished by cutting the mesenteric nerve and by propranolol, and are demonstrable during constant pressure perfusion of muscle. The evidence suggests that occlusion of the mesenteric artery produces an increase in capillary filtration by balancing a reflex sympathetic beta-adrenergic vasodilation in pre-capillary resistance vessels with an increase in resistance in the precapillary sphincters.", 
    "19": "An open study was carried out in general practice on patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension to assess the effectiveness of treatment with pindolol on a single daily dose regimen. In twenty-two previously untreated cases given a single daily dosage of pindolol (mean 13-0 mg, range 5 mg- 30 mg), adequate blood pressure control was achieved within five weeks and maintained in the nineteen patients examined at Week 25. Of eleven previously treated patients whose blood pressure was adequately controlled by divided daily doses of pindolol, a change-over to a single daily dosage of pindolol (mean 13-2 mg, range 10 mg-20 mg) did not result in any loss of control over a twenty-five week study period. Few side-effects were reported, and only one patient was withdrawn from the study.", 
    "20": "On rats with experimental hypertension by method of Selye, modified by Kolarova, distributed in two groups--treated by obsidan and untreated, the following parameters on the 1st and the 3rd month after the operation were studied: pH, BB, SB, AB, BE, PaCO2, TCO2, PaO2, and SaO2. In the hypertonic animals we establish a decompensated metabolic acidosis on the 1st month and a metabolic acidosis with a marked respiratory compensation on the 3rd month. The hypertonic animals, treated by obsidan, demonstrate a sharp tendency to normalise the parameters of the acid-base status on the 1st month and normal values on the 3rd. The protective obsidan effect observed on the hypertonic rat we discuss as a result of metabolic and functional influences of the beta-adrenergic blockers.", 
    "21": "The authors examined dynamically the arterial pressure and plasma activity of 11-hydroxycorticosteroids in two groups of rats with pure hypertension and with hypertension on the background of beta-adrenergic activity. There was an elevation of arterial pressure in both groups, less manifested in the rats, treated with beta blocker. The values after six months were equally high in both groups. The content of 11-hydroxycorticosteroids was increased with a maximum at the sixth month. The authors make an inference that beta blocker-obsidan lowers blood pressure, but does not affect the level of 11-hydroxycorticosteroidids in plasma.", 
    "22": "In a study of 10 patients suffering from hypertension the results showed that combination treatment with prazosin, cyclopenthiazide and a beta-blocker produced a significant fall in blood pressure. Side-effects such as palpitations, headache, syncope and drowsiness which may occur with prazosin alone were obviated by combining prazosin with a beta-blocker.", 
    "23": "The effects of a psychopharmacological agent, sulpiride, and of some neuromediators, dopamine, norepinephrine and propranolol, on the uptake of 3H-thymidine by lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were studied. The lymphoctes were obtained from two populations of subjects, one with HLA-AL CRAG antigens of the HLA-SD series and one without. We found that the presence of the CRAG antigens in the lymphocytes led in the presence of the various drugs to behaviour different from what was seen when the antigens were not present. When the two groups were pooled, PHA lymphocytes activation was inhibited by dopamine, sulpiride, and propranolol and was not effected by norepinephrine.", 
    "24": "Congestive heart failure in neonatal thyrotoxicosis is attributed to sympathetic overstimulation of the myocardium with resulting high-output cardiac failure. An additional case of neonatal thyrotoxicosis with congestive heart failure is discussed; three possible causes (thyrotoxicosis, maternal propranolol therapy, and ventricular septal defect) were present. Along with the usual procedures, the echocardiogram is of value in separating these factors. In addition, we discuss the potential dangers to the newborn of a mother receiving long-term propranolol hydrochloride therapy during pregnancy.", 
    "25": "Pineal nuclear receptor estradiol complex determined by the 3H-estradiol exchange assay exhibited a Kd = 0.42 nM. Its concentration was maximal at proestrus and after administering 2-20 microgram of estradiol to spayed rats. It was also detected in 6-day-old rats, before full maturation of pineal sympathetic nerves is attained. Superior cervical ganglionectomy caused nuclear receptor estrogen complexes (NREC) to decrease by 48 and 65% 5 and 14 days later; estradiol administration brought about increases of complex levels (1.9-2.3-fold) which were significantly smaller than in control or decentralized rats (3.4-3.9-fold). The time course of accumulation and retention of nuclear complexes was not affected by ganglionectomy. Isoproterenol restored the basal levels of NREC, but inhibited the effects of estradiol on complex accumulation; propranolol, administered simultaneously with estradiol also inhibited estrogen effects on the pineal. Estradiol incubation in vitro increased pineal nuclear receptor hormone levels and enhanced the conversion of serotonin into melatonin and 5-methoxytryptophol; no changes in hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase (HIOMT) activity were detected. These data support the conclusion that accumulation and retention of pineal NREC are under partial dependence upon sympathetic nerves.", 
    "26": "The effect of propranolol on diurnal variability of BP and plasma noradrenaline levels was assessed in 15 patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. While total variability and average noradrenaline level remained unaltered, the pressor range (difference between basal and maximum BP readings) was reduced in most patients. An inverse relationship was observed between changes in pressor range and noradrenaline.", 
    "27": "Four cases describing the use of enflurane as the main anesthetic during surgical removal of pheochromocytoma (PCC) are presented and the preoperative preparation and intraoperative management of the patients are discussed. Serum levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured in 3 of the reported cases. Intraoperative values were extremely elevated during tumor manipulation, but there was only 1 minor episode of arrhythmias. Criteria for choosing anesthetic agents for surgical removal of PCC are outlined. The authors conclude from their experience and that of others that enflurane is as safe and effective an anesthetic as any now available for PCC excision.", 
    "28": "Nosologic uncertainty about carotidynia has arisen, in part, because the syndrome was initially classified as an atypical facial neuralgia. More recently, carotidynia has been characterized as a recurring vascular neck pain, often accompanied by carotid tenderness and soft tissue swelling and sometimes by vascular headaches. We now report that drugs useful in the prophylaxis of migraine appear to be effective in carotidynia. Eight women (ages 39 to 77) with unilateral, episodic neck pain of 1 to 19 years' duration have been observed for periods ranging from 7 months to 6 years. All experienced marked relief in the intensity and frequency of their pain syndromes after the administration of methysergide, ergonovine maleate, propranolol, or nortriptyline. No patient had evidence of arteritis. The responsiveness of both migraine headaches and carotidynia to similar drugs suggests a common pathophysiologic mechanism.", 
    "29": "An acute oral administration of 50 mg metoprolol (a selective beta-1-receptor antagonist) to 18 healthy volunteers induced a significant increase in the peripheral platelet concentration lasting more than 4 h. It is suggested that this increment in the platelet count originates from the exchangeable splenic platelet pool. The mechanism by which metoprolol exerts its effect remains to be established.", 
    "30": "Exercise testing is an important means of evaluating the patient with angina pectoris, providing objective data not available from conventional clinical assessment. In utilizing exercise to determine functional impairment in angina, it is essential to distinguish between external stress, or the load on the skeletal muscles, and internal or cardiac stress. Evaluation of external exercise capacity alone is limited as a measure of cardiac peformance since the relationship between external function and cardiac performance is not necessarily direct. A readily applicable approach to determination of cardiac capacity in angina is afforded by indirect assessment of myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). This is achieved through derived indexes utilizing heart rate and blood pressure, two major determinants of MVO2, in the form of the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Although this approach does not encompass all the major determinants of MVO2, changes in the heart rate-blood pressure product bear a close correlation to alterations in directly measured MVO2. Within limits and employed with caution, indirect assessment of MVO2 is useful in elucidating mechanisms of action of extracardiac and intrinsic myocardial factors in the provocation and therapy of angina pectoris.", 
    "31": "The functional relationship between heart rate, under atrial pacing, and the intensity of pacing pulses, was determined for intensities ranging from well below the complete heart rate capture threshold to suprathreshold intensities. A separate capture-intensity function was determined for each of the pacing frequencies 180, 240, 300 and 360 pulses per min, and then used to evaluate the effects of propranolol hydrochloride and atropine sulfate on atrial pacing. Propranolol resulted in an increase in the amount of current (mA) required to achieve a given degree of cardiac capture, whereas atropine resulted in a decrease. These shifts in the capture-intensity functions along the intensity axis were possibly caused by drug antagonism of beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors, respectively, although the effects might also have been due to modifications of the electrical responsivity of the cardiac muscle, independently of the neural blockade.", 
    "32": "In 7 acromegalic patients growth hormone responses were studied following administration of synthetic TRF, propranolol-glucagon, insulin, and glucose p.o. Except for the glucose tolerance test, a good reproducibility of the STH response was observed. In 5 out of the 7 patients, there was a distinct rise in the plasma STH level after TRF. All patients with a positive insulin tolerance test responded to TRF, as did the two late responders to glucagon; the early responder to the latter test did not respond to TRF. It has been suggested (Liuzzi et al. 1974a) that TRF might be used as a screening test for detecting hypothalamic dependency of the acromegaly. This study suggests that further study is required before accepting this hypothesis and that a response to a combination of tests (TRF, glucagon, insulin) might be a better screening method.", 
    "33": "The effect of the oral sulphonylurea hypoglycaemic drugs may be influenced by a large number of other drugs. Some of these combinations (e.g. phenylbutazone, sulphaphenazole) may result in cases of severe hypoglycaemic collapse. Tolbutamide and chlorpropamide should never be given to a patient without a prior careful check of which medicaments are already being given. Similarly, no drug should be given to a diabetic treated with tolbutamide and chlorpropamide without consideration of the possibility of interaction phenomena.", 
    "34": "Prostaglandins have been shown to be involved in the mechanism of renin secretion in a variety of situations. Both arachidonic acid and prostaglandin endoperoxide have been shown to release renin from cortical slices and to be converted to PGI2 by cortical microsomes. In the present studies PGI2 was found to cause a time dependent increase in renin release from rabbit renal cortical slices, a system isolated from any indirect effects that result from the administration of prostaglandins in vivo. The stimulation was linear up to 30 minutes and effective over a range of concentrations from 10(7 M to 10(-5) M. At similar concentrations 6-keto-prostaglandin F1alpha was not active on these slices. Thus, it is proposed that PGI2 exerts a direct effect on the release of renin from cortical cells and may be the mediator of arachidonate or prostaglandin endoperoxide stimulated renin secretion.", 
    "35": "A double-blind, crossover, multicentre study of 98 previously untreated patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension was carried out in general practice to assess the effect of 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg atenolol, given once daily, compared with that of placebo over a period of 4 weeks each. At the end of the double-blind phase, all patients took 100 mg atenolol daily for a further 8 weeks. All three doses of atenolol produced statistically significant falls in systolic and diastolic pressure and pulse rate (p less than 0.001). The lowest pressures were achieved with 100 mg daily; a difference of 22/15 mmHg at the end of the double-bling phase, and a difference of 25/16 mmHg at the final observation. Body weight, blood urea, blood uric acid, and serum electrolytes remained within normal limits throughout the study. The incidence of side-effects with 50 mg and 100 mg atenolol was not significantly different from that caused by placebo, but the incidence of tiredness at the 200 mg dose level was greater than that caused by placebo and by the lower doses. The incidence of possible side-effects elicited by a questionnaire was low, the greatest number being volunteered by patients taking placebo. It is concluded that the optimal dose of atenolol for treating patients with mild to moderate hypertension in general practice is 100 mg daily.", 
    "36": "Nine patients with persistently elevated diastolic blood pressure, exceeding 130 mmHg, received an oral dose of labetalol ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg. In all patients, this produced a significant and gradual decline in recumbent systolic and diastolic blood pressure, unaccompanied by symptoms or complications, with only minor changes in heart rate. Individual variation in the rate of blood pressure fall suggested differences in absorption and first-pass metabolism. It is suggested that the efficacy of oral labetalol merits further investigation in the rapid control of severe hypertension.", 
    "37": "Ten patients with essential hypertension have been studied at rest, during and after exercise following oral treatment for on an average 16 months with a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent, pindolol. The study was a direct continuation of an earlier, performed after 2 months' treatment. The hypotensive effect of pindolol was highly significant after 2 as well as 16 months of treatment. Heart rate was similarly lowered at 2 and 16 months, while carciac output, which was significantly lower during exercise after 2 months, had increased to the pretreatment level after 16 months. Peripheral vascular resistance, which was not affected after 2 months, had decreased significantly during and after exercise in the long-term study. A comparison between the hemodynamic situations after 2 and 16 months thus suggests that while a decrease in cardiac output is an early mechanism in the lowering of BP, changes in systemic vascular resistance seem to be more important after long-term treatment with pindolol.", 
    "38": "In seven hypertensives receiving beta-blocker drugs, and additional reduction in standing blood pressure occurred between 60 and 90 minutes after 40 mg phentolamine by mouth. The occurrence of the postural hypotensive effect was delayed in relation to the reported time of peak plasma concentration of unchanged phentolamine. Supine blood pressure and heart rate were unaffected. Phentolamine has no clinically useful anti-hypertensive effect in conjunction with beta-blockers in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "39": "Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were studied under fasting conditions and following an i.v. and an oral glucose load, respectively, in nine males with moderate hypertension before treatment, after one month on placebo and after three months on the cardioselective beta-receptor blocking agent metoprolol. The studies were performed under metabolic ward conditions. The reproducibility of blood glucose and plasma insulin values following an i.v. glucose load was very good. Medication with metoprolol caused no changes in the fasting levels of blood glucose or plasma insulin, nor in the blood glucose response following a glucose load given i.v. or orally. The initial and total integrated insulin response to the i.v. administration of glucose was similar before and during metroprolol. Following oral glucose both the total integrated blood glucose response and the insulin response were unaffected by treatment with metoprolol.", 
    "40": "Twenty-eight previously untreated patients with essential hypertension were included in a randomized double-blind cross-over study comparing the results of treatment with the established combination of a thiazide and methyldopa (regimen A) with the combination of a beta-receptor blocker and hydralazine (regimen B). Three patients each developed intolerable side-effects on each regimen but they were all treated successfully on the alternative regimen. The remaining 22 patients obtained a significant reduction in BP at rest and during exercise on both treatments, with no significant difference between the two schedules. Heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during exercise with regimen B, while a significant reduction was also obtained following exercise on regimen A. There was no significant difference between the two regimens as to tolerable side-effects during treatment, which were registered in about 60% of the patients on each scheme. However, 64% of the patients were treated satisfactorily without side-effects on either regimen. It is concluded that the combination of a beta-blocking agent and hydralazine is without obvious advantages compared with the combination of thiazide and methyldopa in obtaining initial BP control in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "41": "Subjective discomfort caused by nausea and hot, pruritic skin has been described in patients after ingestion of therapeutic dosages of niacin is shown by this study to be alleviated by propranolol HC1. A dosage of 2 mg, I.V., given incrementally, in a clinical trial of six patients is described. The peripheral vasodilator effects of niacin were attenuated in some subjects but not in others. However, all subjects reported relief of unpleasant symptoms. Serial vital signs were taken and no significant changes were found. It is postulated that propranolol HC1 exerts a calmative effect at the CNS level. In a series that utilized doses of 40 and 80 mg of propranolol HC1 taken orally 30 min prior to the ingestion of 500 or 1000 mg of niacin, a progressive increase in the onset of the niacin flush was observed. It is proposed that as the available plasma level of propranolol HC1 falls, the ratio of niacin to propranolol HC1 increases, exceeding the threshold at which the flush occurs. Both these studies suggest that further work is indicated to establish the possible therapeutic efficacy of propranolol HC1.", 
    "42": "A placebo controlled-blind study performed on new patients presenting with mild to moderate essential hypertension. A once daily combined dose of timolol maleate and bendrofluazide in a 4:1 ratio was administered ot each patient after a four week placebo period. The starting dose was timolol 10 mg and bendrofluazide 2-5 mg and this dose was increased in steps of timolol 10 mg and bendrofluazide 2-5 mg until blood pressure was controlled. Eleven out of twelve patients achieved normotension, the falls in diastolic and systolic blood pressure being highly significant on active treatment compared with placebo. The once daily regimen of timolol and bendrofluazide resulted in good control of blood pressure with no more side-effects than occurred on the placebo. A combination of these two drugs in one tablet would appear to be both practical and advantageous and should increase patient compliance in taking medication.", 
    "43": "The value of practolol in the treatment of angina pectoris was studied in three groups of patients by means of different methods. In 23 patients the effect of the drug was evaluated during long-term treatment and in 10 patients in a controlled double-blind trial; in 20 patients, the working capacity was determined by an ECG exercise test on a bicycle ergometer. Long-term treatment revealed advantageous effects of practolol on the incidence of anginal attacks and the number of nitroglycerin tablets consumed in daily life. There was also a noticeable improvement in the ECG. The results obtained in a double-blind trial, with placebo, proved the effectiveness of the drug. The treatment enabled the patients to lead appreciably more active lives. A marked increase in work performance, depending on the dose applied, was confirmed in exercise tolerance tests. No side-effects which would call for discontinuance of the treatment were seen during long-term administration with doses up to 800 mg daily.", 
    "44": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the functional changes which may occur in the human hypertensive heart following treatment with beta-blocking agents. In 54 primary hypertensive men investigated in the control state and after three weeks of treatment with propranolol (320 mg/day) it was seen that: (a) beta-adrenergic blockade depresses the pre-ejection, and probably the ejection left ventricular function; (b) the former effect is unrelated to changes in peripheral circulation, while the latter result may be either potentiated or overcome, depending on the direction to which treatment shifts the vascular resistance; (c) variations of impedance, rather than of blood pressure, influence the ejection left ventricular function; and (d) withdrawal of the adrenergic support to the heart, due to beta-blockade, is probably the primary factor responsible for the abnormal ventricular adaptation to an augmented impedance."
