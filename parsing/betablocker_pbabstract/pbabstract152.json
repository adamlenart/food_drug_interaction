The index date was the first date of discharge for members with an MI diagnosis. Members were categorized into the active group (automatically enrolled in the DM program) or the control group (not enrolled in the program because their employer group did not purchase the benefit).

Timolol maleate milk levels were examined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and found to be at a mean of 0.12 ng/mL (range, 0 to 0.37 ng/mL). At this level, the theoretical maximum relative infant dose expressed as a percentage of the weight-adjusted maternal dose was 0.012%. As most glaucoma patients administer drops to both eyes, the dosage was duplicated to reflect the more pertinent calculated theoretical relative infant dose of 0.024%. This dose of timolol is unlikely to cause systemic side effects to the healthy breastfed infant.",

Chloroform was used for extraction, and analysis was performed by HPLC on a C18 column with a fluorescence detector. The quantitation limit was 0.25 ng/ml for S(-)-carvedilol in plasma and 0.5 ng/ml for R(+)-carvedilol in plasma and for both enantiomers in urine. The method was applied to the study of enantioselectivity in the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol administered in a multiple dose regimen (25 mg/12 h) to a hypertensive elderly female patient. The data obtained demonstrated highest plasma levels for the R(+)-carvedilol (AUC(SS) (0-12) 75.64 vs 37.29 ng/ml). The enantiomeric ratio R(+)/S(-) was 2.03 for plasma and 1.49 for urine (Ae(0-12) 17.4 vs 11.7 microg).", 
    "7": "The platelet-activating factor (PAF) family of glycerophospholipids accumulates in damaged brain tissue following injury. Little is known about the role of individual isoforms in regulating neuronal survival. Here, we compared the neurotoxic and neuroprotective activities of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16-PAF) and 1-O-octadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C18-PAF) in cerebellar granule neurons. We find that both C16-PAF and C18-PAF cause PAF receptor-independent death but signal through different pathways. C16-PAF activates caspase-7, whereas C18-PAF triggers caspase-independent death in PAF receptor-deficient neurons. We further show that PAF receptor signaling is either pro- or anti-apoptotic, depending upon the identity of the sn-1 fatty acid of the PAF ligand. Activation of the PAF G-protein-coupled receptor (PAFR) by C16-PAF stimulation is anti-apoptotic and inhibits caspase-dependent death. Activation of PAFR by C18-PAF is pro-apoptotic. These results demonstrate the importance of the long-chain sn-1 fatty acid in regulating PAF-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis, caspase-independent neurodegeneration, and neuroprotection in the presence or absence of the PAF receptor.", 
    "8": "ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K(ATP) channels) determine the excitability of pancreatic beta-cells and importantly regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Long-chain free fatty acids (FFAs) decrease GSIS after long-term exposure to beta-cells, but the effects of exogenous FFAs on K(ATP) channels are not yet well clarified. In this study, the effects of linoleic acid (LA) on membrane potential (MP) and K(ATP) channels were observed in primary cultured rat pancreatic beta-cells. LA (20 microM) induced hyperpolarization of MP and opening of K(ATP) channels, which was totally reversed and inhibited by tolbutamide, a K(ATP) channel blocker. Inhibition of LA metabolism by acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor, triacsin C (10 microM), partially inhibited LA-induced opening of K(ATP) channels by 64%. The non-FFA G protein-coupled receptor (GPR) 40 agonist, GW9508 (40 microM), induced an opening of K(ATP) channels, which was similar to that induced by LA under triacsin C treatment. Blockade of protein kinases A and C did not influence the opening of K(ATP) channels induced by LA and GW9508, indicating that these two protein kinase pathways are not involved in the action of LA on K(ATP) channels. The present study demonstrates that LA induces hyperpolarization of MP by activating K(ATP) channels via both intracellular metabolites and activation of GPR40. It indicates that not only intracellular metabolites of FFAs but also GPR40-mediated pathways take part in the inhibition of GSIS and beta-cell dysfunction induced by FFAs.", 
    "9": "In cardiac myocytes there is evidence that activation of some receptors can regulate protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent responses by stimulating cAMP production that is limited to discrete intracellular domains. We previously developed a computational model of compartmentalized cAMP signaling to investigate the feasibility of this idea. The model was able to reproduce experimental results demonstrating that both beta(1)-adrenergic and M(2) muscarinic receptor-mediated cAMP changes occur in microdomains associated with PKA signaling. However, the model also suggested that the cAMP concentration throughout most of the cell could be significantly higher than that found in PKA-signaling domains. In the present study we tested this counterintuitive hypothesis using a freely diffusible fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensor constructed from the type 2 exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac2-camps). It was determined that in adult ventricular myocytes the basal cAMP concentration detected by the probe is approximately 1.2 muM, which is high enough to maximally activate PKA. Furthermore, the probe detected responses produced by both beta(1) and M(2) receptor activation. Modeling suggests that responses detected by Epac2-camps mainly reflect what is happening in a bulk cytosolic compartment with little contribution from microdomains where PKA signaling occurs. These results support the conclusion that even though beta(1) and M(2) receptor activation can produce global changes in cAMP, compartmentation plays an important role by maintaining microdomains where cAMP levels are significantly below that found throughout most of the cell. This allows receptor stimulation to regulate cAMP activity over concentration ranges appropriate for modulating both higher (e.g., PKA) and lower affinity (e.g., Epac) effectors.", 
    "10": "The aims of this study were to develop a transdermal patch for selective controlled delivery of the active S-enantiomer from racemic propranolol, and to evaluate its performance in vivo using Wistar rats. A molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) thin-layer composited cellulose membrane with selectivity for S-propranolol was employed as the enantioselective-controlled release system. The effect of gel reservoir (poloxamer and chitosan) on enantioselective delivery was investigated. The chitosan gel allowed excellent selectivity for delivery of the S-propranolol enantiomer, whilst the more rheologically structured poloxamer gel formulation provided no selective release of S-propranolol. The chitosan gel exhibited high flux and had the ability to enantioselective deliver S-propranolol across excised rat skin. The results from confocal laser scanning microscopy study, carried out with the R- and S-propranolol enantiomers labeled with a 1-pyrenebutyric acid probe as fluorescent markers, suggested that the MIP composite membrane selectively regulated the release of the recognised S-enantiomer via a facilitated transport pathway through complex formation with the selective receptor sites, while the release of the R-enantiomer was via a non-selective route. The reservoir patch for enantiomer-controlled delivery of propranolol was therefore fabricated by incorporating the chitosan gel formulation containing racemic propranolol hydrochloride into the MIP composite membrane laminated backing. These patch devices were shown to exhibit the significant stereoselectivity uptake of propranolol when attached to the skin, using pharmacokinetic studies in rats. S-Propranolol enantiomer plasma concentration profiles for the transdermal patch in the in vivo study were comparable to data for the gel formulations that were applied directly to skin, and containing a single S-enantiomer of propranolol. The results demonstrate that the transdermal patch based on the MIP composite membrane-controlled release system may have potential in the enantioselective-controlled delivery of the S-isomer of racemic propranolol.", 
    "11": "The hereditary long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a genetic channelopathy with variable penetrance that is associated with increased propensity to syncope, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes), and sudden arrhythmic death. This inherited cardiac disorder constitutes an important cause of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in young individuals with normal cardiac morphology. Risk assessment in affected LQTS patients relies upon a constellation of electrocardiographic, clinical, and genetic factors. Administration of beta-blockers is the mainstay therapy in affected patients, and primary prevention with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator or left cervicothoracic sympathetic denervation are therapeutic options in patients who remain symptomatic despite beta-blocker therapy. Accumulating data from the International LQTS Registry have recently facilitated a comprehensive analysis of risk factors for aborted cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death in pre-specified age groups, including the childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and post-40 periods. These analyses have consistently indicated that the phenotypic expression of LQTS is time dependent and age specific, warranting continuous risk assessment in affected patients. Furthermore, the biophysical function, type, and location of the ion-channel mutation are currently emerging as important determinants of outcome in genotyped patients. These new data may be used to improve risk stratification and for the development of gene-specific therapies that may reduce the risk of life-threatening cardiac events in patients with this inherited cardiac disorder.", 
    "12": "We hypothesized that the bowel dysfunction known as low anterior resection syndrome is caused by denervation of the left colon. The purpose of this study is to determine how surgical denervation changes left colon motility and to identify the mechanism of this change.", 
    "13": "Strain gauge transducers were implanted on the serosal surface of the descending colon of male SD rats (250-300 g). After a 2-h baseline recording, motility was recorded for another 2 h after either simple left colon manipulation (n = 6) or surgical left colon denervation (n = 6). Various pharmacologic agents were then administered before denervation to determine the mechanism by which denervation changed left colon motility. Changes in motility were calculated by determining a % motility index (MI) (%MI = MI posttreatment/MI baseline) with significance defined as P < .05.", 
    "14": "Denervation resulted in an increased mean %MI (128.8 +/- 15.4) compared with simple manipulation of the bowel, which decreased mean %MI (87.9 +/- 25.3) (P < .05). In the second set of experiments, both guanethidine and phentolamine increased mean %MI after injection (P < .05), but no additional increase of %MI occurred after denervation (P < .05). However, propranolol produced no increase of motility after injection and it did not affect the increase in motility observed after denervation (P < .05).", 
    "15": "Surgical denervation of the left colon results in a significant increase in motility. Pharmacologically, this increase seems to be the result of destruction of an inhibitory alpha-sympathetic pathway. This increased motility may contribute to low anterior resection syndrome.", 
    "16": "The objective of this work was to prepare and evaluate a new delayed-onset sustained-release system, comprising a sustained-release core tablet with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose as polymer matrix and an ethylcellulose/Eudragit L coating capable of delaying the drug release. The sustained core containing propranolol hydrochloride as the model drug was prepared by granulate tableting and the polymer coating was applied in a computer-controlled coating pan. The dissolution tests demonstrated that the in-vitro drug release was pH-dependent with sufficient gastric resistance, and the lag time (t(10%)) could be controlled by adjusting the coating level. Three dosage forms including commercial tablet, sustained-release tablet and the delayed-onset sustained-release tablet were administrated to six beagle dogs and the plasma levels of propranolol hydrochloride were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. The delayed-onset sustained-release tablet had a lag time of 3.0 h in-vitro and 3.5 h in-vivo, and a t(max) of 7.0 h. The relative bioavailability for delayed-onset sustained-release tablet was 96.98% compared with commercial tablets. The results indicate that the new propranolol delayed-onset sustained-release system could achieve a relatively constant drug release followed by a programmed lag time, and this may provide a promising drug delivery form for chronopharmacotherapy of certain cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "17": "We describe a case of severe congestive heart failure and right ventricular overload associated with overt hyperthyroidism, completely reversed with antithyroid therapy in a few week. It represents a very unusual presentation of overt hyperthyroidism because of the severity of right heart failure. The impressive right ventricular volume overload made mandatory to perform transesophageal echo and angio-TC examination to exclude the coexistence of ASD or anomalous pulmonary venous return. Only a few cases of reversible right heart failure, with or without pulmonary hypertension, have been reported worldwide. In our case the most striking feature has been the normalization of the cardiovascular findings after six weeks of tiamazole therapy.", 
    "18": "The length of hospital stay shortens increasingly. Even more patients are assessed and clarified in the outpatient clinic. Preoperative evaluation is performed ambulatory or by the general practitioner himself. There is still a trend towards fewer and more selective examinations. The value of evaluation algorithms is subject of debate nowadays. Moreover, these extensive and abstract procedures are not always helpful in clinical practice. The perioperative cardioprotection with beta-blockers and statins and the continuation of antiplatelet therapy seems to have significance in reduction of perioperative cardiac events. However, a careful physical examination and a precise medical history of the patient have not become less important today. They contribute significantly to an efficient preoperative evaluation.", 
    "19": "A case of multivessel variant angina after an open radical nephrectomy operation (RNO) is presented. A 52-year-old man was admitted to the coronary care unit with recurrent chest pain and dynamic ST-T wave changes on electrocardiogram early after an RNO. The first diagnosis of the clinical condition was non-ST segment elevation acute coronary syndrome. However, recurrent angina with ST segment elevation occurred after the standard medical therapy, which included beta-blockers. Emergency coronary angiography showed diffuse and multiple narrowing of all the three major coronary arteries during the chest pain, which was relieved by intracoronary nitroglycerine injection. Variant angina was suspected, and beta-blocker therapy was replaced with calcium channel blocker treatment. No angina attacks were observed during the clinical follow-up. Although a direct relationship between the type of surgery and variant angina was not established, coronary vasospasm after an RNO should be kept in mind, especially in the differential diagnosis of a patient with recurrent angina and dynamic ST-T changes on electrocardiogram. Although beta-blocker therapy is a first-line treatment for all acute coronary syndromes, it can be harmful in patients with variant angina and should be stopped immediately after verification of diagnosis.", 
    "20": "The role of cholesterol in eukaryotic membrane protein function has been attributed primarily to an influence on membrane fluidity and curvature. We present the 2.8 A resolution crystal structure of a thermally stabilized human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor bound to cholesterol and the partial inverse agonist timolol. The receptors pack as monomers in an antiparallel association with two distinct cholesterol molecules bound per receptor, but not in the packing interface, thereby indicating a structurally relevant cholesterol-binding site between helices I, II, III, and IV. Thermal stability analysis using isothermal denaturation confirms that a cholesterol analog significantly enhances the stability of the receptor. A consensus motif is defined that predicts cholesterol binding for 44% of human class A receptors, suggesting that specific sterol binding is important to the structure and stability of other G protein-coupled receptors, and that this site may provide a target for therapeutic discovery.",

    "22": "Major electronic databases were searched from December 2003 to May 2007.", 
    "23": "Selected studies were assessed, subjected to data extraction using a standard template and quality assessment using published criteria. A simple short-term economic model was developed, informed by a systematic review of economic evaluations and populated with data from a review of costing/resource-use studies and other published studies. The cost-effectiveness of magnesium sulphate as prophylaxis was estimated for a set of base-case assumptions and the robustness of these results was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.", 
    "24": "Twenty-two papers met the inclusion criteria reporting 15 trials which all compared magnesium sulphate with placebo or control. They ranged in size from 15 to 176 patients randomised, and were conducted in Europe, the USA and Canada. The standard of reporting was generally poor, with details of key methodological attributes difficult to elucidate. No trials were identified that specifically aimed to compare magnesium sulphate with sotalol. Of 1070 patients in the pooled magnesium group, 230 (21%) developed postoperative AF, compared with 307 of 1031 (30%) patients in the placebo or (control) group. Meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model generated a pooled odds ratio (OR) that was significantly less than 1.0 [OR=0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.79, test for overall effect p<0.0001], but with statistically significant heterogeneity (I2=63.4%, p=0.0005). Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were notable as they had relatively lower ORs in favour of magnesium sulphate. When these were removed from the analyses the pooled OR remained statistically significant, but heterogeneity no longer remained significant. These two studies tended to impart a highly significant reduction in the odds of AF to whichever subgroup they were analysed in. When studies were ordered by total duration of prophylaxis, an apparent relationship between duration and odds of AF was evident, with decreasing odds of AF as duration of prophylaxis increased. This was confirmed by linear regression analysis (R2=0.743, p<0.001). When the data were grouped into three classes according to duration, a statistically significant intervention effect was only present for the longest duration (OR=0.12, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23, p=0.00001). Statistically significant intervention effects were associated with the initiation of prophylaxis 12 hours or more before surgery (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.44, test for overall effect p=0.00001, fixed-effects model) and less than 12 hours before surgery or during the surgery itself (OR=0.73, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.97, test for overall effect p = 0.03, fixed-effects model), but not when prophylaxis was initiated at the end of surgery or postsurgery (OR=0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.22, p=0.37, fixed-effects model). When studies were ordered by total dose of intravenous magnesium sulphate (<25 g), the odds of AF were independent of the dose. A notable exception was that for a total dose of 9 g magnesium sulphate; here the odds of AF were significantly reduced relative to the control group, although this may be explained by the fact that these studies had excluded patients who were on antiarrhythmic drugs and so may have been at higher risk of AF. Sixty-three potentially relevant references about cost-effectiveness were identified, but no economic evaluations of intravenous magnesium alone as prophylaxis against AF following CABG, compared with sotalol as prophylaxis or no prophylaxis, were identified. Studies reporting resource use by patients with AF following CABG suggest that while AF significantly increased inpatient stays, by up to 2.3 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 3.4 days on the ward, differences in length of stay and costs between patients receiving prophylaxis and those not receiving prophylaxis were not statistically significant. In the base-case analysis, magnesium sulphate prophylaxis resulted in 0.081 fewer cases of AF at an incremental cost of 2.55 pounds sterling. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 32 pounds sterling per AF case avoided. The estimated difference in average length of stay between the prophylaxis and no-prophylaxis strategies was only 0.24 days, despite a large assumed difference of 3 days for patients experiencing AF in each group (1 extra day in the ICU and 2 extra days on the ward). In a deterministic sensitivity analysis the greatest variation in ICERs was observed for input parameters relating to the baseline risk of AF following CABG and the effectiveness of prophylaxis, cost of prophylaxis and the resource consequences of postoperative AF. The largest ICER (2092 pounds sterling) in the sensitivity analysis was associated with increasing the length of patients' preoperative stay. In the base case it was assumed that admission routines would be identical under both strategies. However, patients receiving prophylaxis by intravenous infusion may have longer preoperative stays. In a probabilistic analysis the majority of the simulations were associated with improved outcomes (in this case fewer cases of AF), but also higher costs. Prophylaxis was the dominant strategy (better outcome at lower cost) in about 41% of the simulations using the base-case assumptions. Under an alternative scenario where patients receiving prophylaxis are admitted for longer before their operation, to receive their initial infusion, the proportion of simulations where prophylaxis dominates fell to around 5%. The probability of being cost-effective was 99% at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 2000 pounds sterling per AF case avoided and 100% at a WTP threshold of 5000 pounds sterling per AF case avoided under the base-case assumptions. Under the alternative scenario of longer preoperative stays the probability of being cost-effective at these two threshold values fell to 48% and 93%, respectively. It is unclear what the appropriate decision threshold should be, given that this model used intermediate rather than final outcomes.", 
    "25": "No RCTs were identified that specifically aimed to compare intravenous magnesium with sotalol as prophylaxis for AF in patients undergoing CABG. Intravenous magnesium, compared with placebo or control, is effective in preventing postoperative AF, as confirmed by a statistically significant intervention effect based on pooled analysis of 15 RCTs. It was also found that AF was less likely to occur when a longer duration of prophylaxis was used, and the earlier that prophylaxis is started; however, this finding was associated with two RCTs that had more favourable results than the other trials. No clear relationship between dose and AF was observed, although a lower constant dose rate was associated with the lowest odds of AF. Further research should investigate the relationship between dose, dose rate, duration of prophylaxis, timing of initiation of therapy and patient characteristics, such as degree of risk for AF. This will provide stronger evidence for the optimum delivery of intravenous magnesium in patients undergoing CABG. In the base-case analysis in the economic model, magnesium sulphate prophylaxis reduced the number of postoperative AF cases at a modest increase in cost. The results of the economic analysis are highly sensitive to variation in certain key parameters. Prophylaxis is less likely to be a cost-effective option if it requires changes in admission routines that result in longer preoperative stays than would be the case without prophylaxis.",

    "30": "To compare the mechanisms underlying mechanical responses to ephedrine and Ephedra herb, a main component of Kakkon-to, in isolated male and female rabbit urinary bladder and urethral strips, responses of isolated strips to the agents were recorded in organ bath systems. Ephedrine and Ephedra herb relaxed the female urinary bladder to the similar extent. These relaxations are reversed to contractions by timolol. In the presence of timolol, ephedrine produced less contraction of urethral strips in the female than those in the male; this contraction was abolished by prazosin. Ephedra herb contracted the female urethra less than that of the male, and the contraction was stronger than that by ephedrine. The contraction caused by Ephedra herb in strips treated with timolol was significantly inhibited by prazosin. The prazosin-resistant contraction of the female urethra was greater than that of the male. Quinacrine, a phospholipase A(2) inhibitor, indomethacin, and AA861, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, inhibited the contraction. The contraction was inhibited by ZK 158252, a leukotriene (LT) B(4)-receptor antagonist. These findings suggest that Ephedra herb contracts the urethra via arachidonic acid metabolites together with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor stimulation. The metabolites produced by 5-lipoxygenase may stimulate LTB(4), but not CysLt(1), receptors. These contractile components induced by Ephedra herb and Kakkon-to might be effective for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.",

Only after treatment with formoterol, BRL 37344 and, to a lesser extent, cirazoline was measured a significant increase in ISC (57%, 33.2%, and 4.7%, respectively). The formoterol and BRL 37344 concentrations producing half-maximal effect (EC50) were 1.12 and 70.1 nM, respectively. Moreover, the formoterol effect was inhibited by treatment with ICI 118551 (antagonist of beta2 receptors) while SR 59230A (antagonist of beta3 receptors) had no effect; opposite findings were obtained when the BRL 37344 stimulation was investigated. Finally, by measuring the transepithelial fluxes of 22Na+ and 36Cl-, we demonstrated that Na+ absorption is increased by activation of beta2 and beta3 and is cAMP-sensitive, whereas the Cl- secretion is only increased by activation of beta2 receptors and is cAMP- and calmodulin-sensitive.",

However, recently questions have been raised by several investigators regarding the antihypertensive effectiveness and safety of these drugs. The Medline literature on this subject was searched and pertinent studies were retrieved. Other pertinent references from existing publications were retrieved and analyzed up to 2007. Additionally, a historical perspective on the discovery of beta-blockers and their mechanism of action is given. Most of the reviewed short-term and long-term clinical trials demonstrate an effective and safe antihypertensive pattern for the beta-blockers. The weaknesses identified include the adverse effect of older beta-blockers on glucose control and stroke protection, especially in older persons. These adverse effects are attributed to their mechanism of action and BP effectiveness. On the basis of the evidence presented, beta-blockers are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs and should still be recommended as first-line therapy in most uncomplicated hypertensive patients, either alone or in combination with other drugs. There are reservations regarding their administration to diabetic and older hypertensive patients. However, when compelling indications for their use exist, they should not be withheld.",

    "46": "Nebivolol is a novel, highly selective beta(1)-receptor blocker that causes peripheral vasodilation by increasing the production and release of nitric oxide and decreasing nitric oxide degradation. The nitric oxide-mediated effects of nebivolol lead to decreases in systemic vascular resistance and large artery stiffness and possible reversal of endothelial dysfunction. Clinical studies have shown nebivolol to be at least as effective at lowering blood pressure as other antihypertensive drugs, including other beta-blockers. The most frequent adverse events reported in nebivolol clinical trials were transient headache, dizziness, and tiredness. In a large trial in patients with heart failure, nebivolol was shown to reduce the composite endpoint of mortality and hospitalizations. Nebivolol is highly lipophilic and is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The nebivolol dose most commonly used in clinical trials for hypertension was 5 mg daily; no significant further decreases in blood pressure were shown with higher doses. The average dose in clinical trials for patients with heart failure was 5-10 mg daily. Dosage adjustments are recommended in elderly patients and patients with severe renal impairment.",

Antihypertensive agents from different classes may offset adverse reactions from each other, such as a diuretic decreasing edema occurring secondary to treatment with a calcium channel blocker. Most patients with hypertension require more than a single antihypertensive agent, particularly if they have comorbid conditions. Although the Joint National Committee guidelines recommend diuretic therapy as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of \"compelling indications\" may prompt treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate a particular benefit in primary or secondary prevention. Specific recommendations include treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists for hypertensive patients with heart failure. For hypertensive patients with diabetes, recommended treatment includes diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and/or calcium channel blockers. Recommended treatment for hypertensive patients with increased risk of coronary disease includes a diuretic, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and/or calcium channel blocker.

    "51": "We investigated whether autonomic nervous system imbalance imposed by pharmacological blockades and associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is manifested as modifications of the nonlinear interactions in heart rate variability signal using a statistically based bispectrum method. The statistically based bispectrum method is an ideal approach for identifying nonlinear couplings in a system and overcomes the previous limitation of determining in an ad hoc way the presence of such interactions. Using the improved bispectrum method, we found significant nonlinear interactions in healthy young subjects, which were abolished by the administration of atropine but were still present after propranolol administration. The complete decoupling of nonlinear interactions was obtained with double pharmacological blockades. Nonlinear couplings were found to be the strongest for healthy young subjects followed by degradation with old age and a complete absence of such couplings for the old age-matched AMI subjects. Our results suggest that the presence of nonlinear couplings is largely driven by the parasympathetic nervous system regulation and that the often-reported autonomic nervous system imbalance seen in AMI subjects is manifested as the absence of nonlinear interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous regulations.",

The focus of this research was to develop a four-probe microdialysis sampling design to simultaneously monitor the stomach lumen, mucosa, submucosa and in the blood of the rat. Due to the small outer diameter of the microdialysis probe (350 microm), implantation into each separate layer was achieved with confirmation of probe location from histological examination. To assess the significance of sampling by this approach, multiple probe microdialysis sampling was used to monitor drug absorption in the stomach.

    "74": "Fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are poorly understood disorders that share similar demographic and clinical characteristics. The etiology and pathophysiology of these diseases remain unclear. Because of the similarities between both disorders it was suggested that they share a common pathophysiological mechanisms, namely, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Current hypotheses center on atypical sensory processing in the CNS and dysfunction of skeletal muscle nociception and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Researches suggest that the (CNS) is primarily involved in both disorders in regard to the pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances. Many patients experience difficulty with concentration and memory and many others have mood disturbance, including depression and anxiety. Although fibromyalgia is common and associated with substantial morbidity and disability, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments except pregabalin. Recent pharmacological treatment studies about fibromyalgia have focused on selective serotonin and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitors, which enhance serotonin and NE neurotransmission in the descending pain pathways and lack many of the adverse side effects associated with tricyclic medications. CFS is a descriptive term used to define a recognisable pattern of symptoms that cannot be attributed to any alternative condition. The symptoms are currently believed to be the result of disturbed brain function. To date, no pharmacological agent has been reliably shown to be effective treatment for CFS. Management strategies are therefore primarily directed at relief of symptoms and minimising impediments to recovery. This chapter presents data demonstrating CFS, abnormal pain processing and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction in FM and CFS and concludes by reviewing the new concepts in treatments in CFS and FM.",

    "85": "The hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) pathway is known to play an important role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Here, we hypothesize that citrate, an intermediate metabolite, activates hypothalamic ACC and is involved in the control of energy mobilization. Initially, we showed that ICV citrate injection decreased food intake and diminished weight gain significantly when compared to control and pair-fed group results. In addition, we showed that intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of citrate diminished (80% of control) the phosphorylation of ACC, an important AMPK substrate. Furthermore, citrate treatment inhibited (75% of control) hypothalamic AMPK phosphorylation during fasting. In addition to its central effect, ICV citrate injection led to low blood glucose levels during glucose tolerance test (GTT) and high glucose uptake during hyperglycemic-euglycemic clamp. Accordingly, liver glycogen content was higher in animals given citrate (ICV) than in the control group (23.3+/-2.5 vs. 2.7+/-0.5 microg mL(-1) mg(-1), respectively). Interestingly, liver AMPK phosphorylation was reduced (80%) by the citrate treatment. The pharmacological blockade of beta3-adrenergic receptor (SR 59230A) blocked the effect of ICV citrate and citrate plus insulin on liver AMPK phosphorylation. Consistently with these results, rats treated with citrate (ICV) presented improved insulin signal transduction in liver, skeletal muscle, and epididymal fat pad. Similar results were obtained by hypothalamic administration of ARA-A, a competitive inhibitor of AMPK. Our results suggest that the citrate produced by mitochondria may modulate ACC phosphorylation in the hypothalamus, controlling food intake and coordinating a multiorgan network that controls glucose homeostasis and energy uptake through the adrenergic system.", 
    "86": "A recent clinical study has shown that carvedilol has a significantly more favorable effect than metoprolol on survival rate in patients with heart failure. This may be due to actions of carvedilol such as beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade and other properties such as anti-oxidant effects that are not yet fully understood. We compared the effects of racemic carvedilol, metoprolol and carvedilol enantiomers on cardiac hypertrophy at similar heart rate in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Continuous administration of isoproterenol for 2 weeks produced heart failure, which is characterized by an increased heart rate, cardiac hypertrophy and downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors. The doses of racemic carvedilol and metoprolol were adjusted to obtain a similar heart rate in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The reduction of left ventricular weight and improvement of cAMP production induced by carvedilol were superior to those induced by metoprolol. Although heart rate, blood pressure and cAMP production were not affected by R-carvedilol, left ventricular weight was significantly reduced as a result of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. The improvement of cAMP production by S-carvedilol was significantly higher than that induced by coadministration of R-carvedilol and metoprolol, suggesting that beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade partly contributed to the improvement of signal transduction in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. This study has demonstrated that the effects of carvedilol on cAMP production and cardiac hypertrophy in rats with isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy are superior to those induced by metoprolol at a similar heart rate.",

Staurosporine increased caspase 3-like activity, DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, and the number of TUNEL positive cells consistent with the induction of apoptosis. Propranolol and ICI 118551, but not atenolol, demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of caspase 3-like activity. Propranolol and ICI 118551 directly inhibited the enzymatic activity of recombinant caspase 9 while atenolol did not; however, none of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers that were examined directly blocked caspases 2 or 3 activity. In isolated mitochondria, propranolol and ICI 118551 inhibited staurosporine-induced cytochrome c release while atenolol did not. We conclude that propranolol and ICI 118551 protect SH-SY5Y cells against staurosporine-induced apoptosis through a dual action on the mitochondria and on caspase 9 in a cell type and an apoptotic paradigm where the conventional inhibitors of mitochondrial permeability transition such as cyclosporin A and bongkrekic acid demonstrate no protection.",

Slowing down the progression of AAAs is of great interest as this could prevent cost-intensive and potential lethal operations. Recent studies indicate that modern medical treatment such as prevention for cardiovascular disease has a spin-off benefit by suppressing the expansion rate of AAAs.

    "98": "Rodents re-exposed to the elevated plus-maze no longer respond to anxiolytic-like drugs, such as benzodiazepines. This phenomenon is thought to be due to retrieval of aversive learning associated with the initial exploration of this potentially dangerous environment Based on this assumption, one might expect the maintenance of the drug's anxiolytic-like effect in rodents already experienced in the elevated plus-maze if the acquisition and/or consolidation of this learning were impaired. Using male Wistar rats, we investigated whether the systemic administration of propranolol, at putative learning-impairing doses, prior to or immediately after the first (Trial 1) elevated plus-maze exposure would retain the midazolam anxiolytic-like effect on the second (Trial 2) exposure to this apparatus. There was an anxiolytic-like effect, characterized by an increase in the open-arms exploration, in response to 0.25 mg/kg of midazolam on Trial 2 only in rats administered with 20 mg/kg of propranolol before Trial 1. Although propranolol had a dose-dependent and behaviorally-selective anti-anxiety effect (significant at 20 mg/kg) on Trial 1, further minute-by-minute analysis confirmed the propranolol-induced learning acquisition deficit in this group on Trial 2. The knowledge of the environment actually contributes to the unresponsiveness to anxiolytic-like drugs observed in rats re-exposed to the elevated plus-maze.", 
    "99": "Nicotine causes vasodilation in the renal vasculature through as yet unidentified mechanism. This study investigated the role of endothelial and non-endothelial factors in the vasodilatory action of nicotine in the rat isolated kidney. Nicotine vasodilation in phenylephrine-preconstricted perfused kidneys was evaluated in the absence and presence of drugs that interfere with nitric oxide synthase (NOS), K+ channels, cholinergic or adrenergic activity. Nicotine infusion (5 x 10(-5), 1 x 10(-4), and 5 x 10(-4) M) produced concentration-dependent decreases in the renal perfusion pressure, which continued for 20 min with a peak depressor effect observed at approximately 3 min. Nicotine vasodilation was associated with increases in norepinephrine and NO metabolites (nitrite/nitrate, NOx) levels in the renal effluent. Chemical denudation of the endothelium with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS), or inhibition of NOS (NG-nitro-L-arginine, L-NNA), or guanylate cyclase (methylene blue) almost abolished the renal vasodilatory action of nicotine. Nicotine vasodilation was also significantly attenuated after selective blockade of ATP-sensitive (K(ATP), glibenclamide) or inward rectifier (Kir, BaCl2) K+ channels but remained unaltered after blockade of large-conductance calcium-activated (BKCa, tetraethylammonium, TEA) or voltage-dependent (Kv, 4-aminopyridine) K+ channels. Hexamethonium (ganglionic blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenceptor blocker), guanethidine (adrenergic neuron blocker), atropine (muscarinic antagonist) or the use of kidneys preconstricted with 80 mM KCl reduced the vasodepressor action of nicotine. Finally, exposure to diclophenac or neostigmine had no effect on nicotine vasodilation. Together, these findings implicate endothelial NOS and KATP and Kir channels in the renal vasodepressor effect of nicotine. Further, the sympathetic-dependent NO-mediated neurogenic vasodilation apparently contributes, at least partly, to nicotine vasodilation.",

We examined the oxidation and glucuronidation of carvedilol in human liver microsomes (HLM) and human intestinal microsomes (HIM). The oxidation of carvedilol in HLM and HIM was evaluated in the presence of NADPH, whereas glucuronidation was evaluated in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid. Oxidation of S-carvedilol in HLM and HIM was greater than that of R-carvedilol. In addition, the oxidation of R-carvedilol in HLM was inhibited by quinidine, whereas that of S-carvedilol was inhibited by both quinidine and furafylline. On the other hand, R- and S-carvedilol oxidation in HIM was inhibited by ketoconazole. Glucuronidation of S-carvedilol in HLM and HIM was also higher than that of R-carvedilol. These results suggested that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in the stereoselective oxidation of carvedilol in the liver, that CYP3A4 is involved in intestinal oxidation, and that glucuronidation in the liver and intestine is at least partly responsible for stereoselective presystemic clearance.", 
    "122": "Hypertension is associated with mild decrements in cognition. In addition, regional cerebral blood flow responses during memory processing are blunted in parietal and thalamic areas among untreated hypertensive adults, who, compared with normotensive subjects, manifest greater correlation in blood flow response across task-related brain regions. Here, we test whether pharmacological treatment of hypertension normalizes regional cerebral blood flow responses and whether it does so differentially according to drug class. Treatment with lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme blocker, known to enhance vasodilative responsivity, was compared with treatment with atenolol, a beta-blocker. Untreated hypertensive volunteers (n=28) were randomly assigned and treated for 1 year. Whole brain and regional cerebral flow responses to memory processing and acutely administered acetazolamide, a vasodilator, were assessed pretreatment and posttreatment. Peripheral brachial artery dilation during reactive hyperemia was also measured. Quantitative blood flow measures showed no difference in the magnitude of regional cerebral blood flow responses pretreatment and posttreatment to either memory tasks or acetazolamide injection. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation increased with treatment. No differences between medications were observed. In brain regions active in memory processing, however, regional cerebral blood flow responses were more highly correlated after treatment. Specificity of cerebral blood flow to different regions appears to decline with treatment of hypertension. This greater correlation among active brain regions, which is present as well in untreated hypertensive relative to normotensive volunteers, may represent compensation in the face of less region-specific responsivity in individuals with hypertension.",

They also clearly reduced the response to endogenous noradrenaline release (tyramine) in SHR but had little effect in WKY. When pertussis toxin reduced baseline, it also eliminated the tyramine TPVR response. Propranolol did not change the effect of milrinone on the phenylephrine or tyramine response.

Beta-adrenergic activity shortened the QT interval. This effect was abolished in the presence of propranolol. In addition, sera from CChP without beta-adrenergic activity (Ab-beta) did not modulate QT interval. The M cell action potential duration (APD) was reversibly shortened by Ab-beta.

Here we determine whether caveolae, invaginated lipid rafts, are responsible for confining the beta(2) adrenoceptor (AR) cAMP signal to the sarcolemmal compartment. Myocytes were treated with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M beta C) to disrupt caveolae. Caveolae-containing membrane fractions were isolated by detergent-free sucrose gradient fractionation. Cell shortening and phosphorylation of the sarcoplasmic reticular protein phospholamban (PLB) and the myofilament protein troponin I (TnI) were measured in response to beta(2) AR stimulation (with salbutamol in the presence of 1 microM atenolol). Ser(16) phosphorylation of PLB (pPLB), Ser(22,23) phosphorylation of TnI (pTnI), and positive lusitropy were used as indices of global cAMP signals. The ability of M beta C to disrupt caveolae was confirmed by selective depletion of the buoyant membrane fractions of cholesterol and caveolin 3, the 2 essential components of caveolae. In control cells, no change in pPLB, pTnI or time to half relaxation was recorded with beta(2) AR stimulation (P>0.05), but following caveolar disruption a 60-70% increase in phosphorylation of both proteins was seen, accompanied by positive lusitropy (P<0.05). These data show for the first time that disrupting caveolae converts the sarcolemmal-confined cAMP signal associated with beta(2) AR stimulation to a global signal that targets proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofilaments, with functional sequelae. The role of caveolae in spatial control of cAMP may be relevant to perturbation of beta AR signalling in cardiovascular disease.",

Using such packed 96-tips, a 96-well plate could be handled in about 2 min. The key aspect of the monolithic phase is that monolithic material can provide both relatively good binding capacity and relatively low backpressure properties. The validation of the methodology showed that the accuracy values of quality-control samples were between 101% and 103% for metoprolol, while between 94% and 114% for pindolol.

The authors have recently shown that beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) stimulates DBI gene expression and endozepine release. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of action of Abeta in cultured rat astrocytes. Abeta(25-35) and the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonist N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) increased the secretion of endozepines in a dose-dependent manner with EC(50) value of approximately 2 microM. The stimulatory effects of Abeta(25-35) and the FPR agonists fMLF and N-formyl-Met-Met-Met (fMMM) on endozepine release were abrogated by the FPR antagonist N-t-Boc-Phe-Leu-Phe-Leu-Phe. In contrast, Abeta(25-35) increased DBI mRNA expression through a FPR-independent mechanism. Abeta(25-35) induced a transient stimulation of cAMP formation and a sustained activation of polyphosphoinositide turnover. The stimulatory effect of Abeta(25-35) on endozepine release was blocked by the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor somatostatin, the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine and the ATP binding cassette transporter blocker glyburide. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that Abeta(25-35) stimulates endozepine release from rat astrocytes through a FPR receptor positively coupled to PKA and PKC.", 
    "161": "Adrenergic receptor (AR) activation increases expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) mRNA, which may promote mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscles. An AR-activated increase in PGC-1alpha mRNA was observed in exercise. PGC-1alpha mRNA is considered a single transcript (PGC-1alpha-a); however, a transcript search of PGC-1alpha in expressed sequence tag libraries revealed that two novel isoforms of PGC-1alpha mRNA, named PGC-1alpha-b and PGC-1alpha-c, were expressed in mice tissues. Compared with PGC-1alpha-a mRNA (a previously described isoform), PGC-1alpha-b or PGC-1alpha-c mRNA was transcribed by a different exon 1 of the PGC-1alpha gene and produced slightly smaller-sized proteins. PGC-1alpha-b or PGC-1alpha-c protein was functional; both isoforms possessed transcriptional activity and could coactivate PPARs, similar to those in PGC-1alpha-a in vitro. Transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1alpha-b or PGC-1alpha-c in skeletal muscles showed increased gene expression related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. In C57BL/6J mice, injection of the beta2-AR agonist clenbuterol increased PGC-1alpha-b and PGC-1alpha-c mRNA expression more than 350-fold, but not PGC-1alpha-a, in skeletal muscle. A single bout of exercise also increased PGC-1alpha-b and PGC-1alpha-c mRNAs, but not PGC-1alpha-a, in skeletal muscles. The increases in skeletal muscles in response to exercise were inhibited by pretreatment with the beta2-AR-specific inhibitor ICI 118,551. However, in liver, fasting increased PGC-1alpha-a mRNA, but not PGC-1alpha-b and PGC-1alpha-c mRNAs. These data indicate that AR activation is a major mechanism of an increase in PGC-1alpha expression in skeletal muscles, and the increase in PGC-1alpha mRNAs was isoform specific.", 
    "162": "To date, the existence of the plant inner membrane anion channel (PIMAC) has been shown only in potato mitochondria, but its physiological role remains unclear. In this study, by means of swelling experiments in K(+) and ammonium salts, we characterize a PIMAC-like anion-conducting pathway in mitochondria from durum wheat (DWM), a monocotyledonous species phylogenetically far from potato. DWM were investigated since they possess a very active potassium channel (PmitoK(ATP)), so implying a very active matching anion uniport pathway and, possibly, a coordinated function. As in potato mitochondria, the electrophoretic uptake of chloride and succinate was inhibited by matrix [H(+)], propranolol, and tributyltin, and was insensitive to Mg(2+), N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and mercurials, thus showing PIMAC's existence in DWM. PIMAC actively transports dicarboxylates, oxodicarboxylates, tricarboxylates and Pi. Interestingly, a novel mechanism of swelling in ammonium salts of isolated plant mitochondria is reported, based on electrophoretic anion uptake via PIMAC and ammonium uniport via PmitoK(ATP). PIMAC is inhibited by physiological compounds, such as ATP and free fatty acids, by high electrical membrane potential (Delta Psi), but not by acyl-CoAs or reactive oxygen species. PIMAC was found to cooperate with dicarboxylate carrier by allowing succinate uptake that triggers succinate/malate exchange in isolated DWM. Similar results were obtained using mitochondria from the dicotyledonous species topinambur, so suggesting generalization of results. We propose that PIMAC is normally inactive in vivo due to ATP and Delta Psi inhibition, but activation may occur in mitochondria de-energized by PmitoK(ATP) (or other dissipative systems) to replace or integrate the operation of classical anion carriers.",

The drug release data were analyzed to get insight in the release kinetics and mechanism. Formulations containing metoprolol tartrate (30%, model drug), EC with dibutyl sebacate (matrix former and plasticizer) and hydrophilic polymer HPMC were extruded and subsequently injection moulded into tablets (375 mg, 10 mm diameter, convex-shaped) at temperatures ranging from 110 to 140 degrees C. Tablets containing 30% metoprolol and 70% ethylcellulose (EC 4mPa s) showed an incomplete drug release within 24 h (<50%). Increasing production temperatures resulted in a lower drug release rate. Substituting part of the EC fraction by HPMC (HPMC/EC-ratio: 20/50 and 35/35) resulted in faster and constant drug release rates. Formulations containing 50% HPMC had a complete and first-order drug release profile with drug release controlled via the combination of diffusion and swelling/erosion. Faster drug release rates were observed for higher viscosity grades of EC (Mw>20 mPa s) and HPMC (4000 and 10,000 mPa s). Tablet porosity was low (<4%). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction studies (X-RD) showed that solid dispersions were formed during processing. Using thermogravimetrical analysis (TGA) and gel-permeation chromatography no degradation of drug and matrix polymer was observed. The surface morphology was investigated with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showing an influence of the process temperature. Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the drug is distributed in the entire matrix, however, some drug clusters were identified.", 
    "164": "Pro-arrhythmia (development of cardiac arrhythmias as a pharmacological side effect) has become the single most common cause of the withdrawal or restrictions of previously marketed drugs. The development of new medications, free from these side effects, is hampered by the lack of an in vitro assay for human cardiac tissue. We hypothesized that human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) assessed with a combination of single cell electrophysiology and microelectrode array (MEA) mapping can serve as a novel model for electrophysiological drug screening. Current-clamp studies revealed that E-4031 and Sotalol (IKr blockers) significantly increased hESC-CM's action potential duration and also induced after-depolarizations (the in vitro correlates of increased arrhythmogenic potential). Multicellular aggregates of hESC-CMs were then analyzed with the MEA technique. Application of class I (Quinidine, Procaineamide) and class III (Sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents, E-4031, and Cisapride (a noncardiogenic agent known to lengthen QT) resulted in dose-dependent prolongation of the corrected field potential duration (cFPD). We next utilized the MEA technique to also assess pharmacological effects on conduction. Activation maps demonstrated significant conduction slowing following administration of Na channel blockers (Quinidine and Propafenone) and of the gap junction blocker (1-heptanol). While most attention has been focused on the prospects of using hESC-derived cardiomyocytes for regenerative medicine, this study highlights the possible utilization of these unique cells also for cardiac electrophysiological studies, drug screening, and target validation.",

Myocardial ischemia is often associated with cardiac complications in the perioperative patient. Unfortunately, an episode of myocardial ischemia will result in a 70% mortality rate. Perioperative patients are complex because of their atypical presentation, incisional pain, and the effects of analgesia. The critical care nurse must be able to determine a patient's risk factors and surgical risks and then take measures to ensure that the patient receives adequate treatment both before and after surgery. beta-Blockers may decrease a patient's risk of developing myocardial ischemia, yet they are often underused. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to ensure the proper use of beta-blockers in an effort to reduce cardiac complications in the perioperative elderly patient.",

These cardiostimulant beta-blockers, coined non-conventional partial agonists, antagonize the effects of catecholamines through a high-affinity site (beta(1H)AR), but cause cardiostimulation mainly through a low-affinity site (beta(1L)AR) of the myocardial beta(1)-adrenoceptor. The experimental non-conventional partial agonist (-)-CGP12177 increases cardiac L-type Ca(2+) current density and Ca(2+) transients, shortens action potential duration but augments action potential plateau, increases heart rate and force, as well as causes arrhythmic Ca(2+) transients and arrhythmic cardiocyte contractions. Other beta-blockers, which do not cause cardiostimulation, consistently have lower affinity for beta(1L)AR than beta(1H)AR. These sites were verified and the cardiac pharmacology of non-conventional partial agonists confirmed on recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors and on beta(1)-adrenoceptors overexpressed into the heart. A targeted mutation of Asp138 to Glu138 virtually abolished the pharmacology of beta(1H)AR but left intact the pharmacology of beta(1L)AR.

    "211": "Insulin resistance is a major pathological condition associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance and the renin-angiotensin system are intimately linked. We evaluated the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance-associated, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by using the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan medoxomil in a diabetic rat model. The effects of olmesartan on methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced steatohepatitis were investigated in obese, diabetic Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. Components of the renin-angiotensin system were up-regulated in the livers of OLETF rats, compared with LETO rats. In OLETF, but not LETO, rats, oral administration of olmesartan for 8 weeks ameliorated insulin resistance. Moreover, olmesartan suppressed MCD diet-induced hepatic steatosis and the hepatic expression of lipogenic genes (sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c and fatty acid synthase) in OLETF, but not LETO, rats. In both OLETF and LETO rats, olmesartan inhibited hepatic oxidative stress (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified protein) and expression of NADPH oxidase. Olmesartan also inhibited hepatic fibrosis, stellate cell activation, and expression of fibrogenic genes (transforming growth factor-beta, alpha 1 [I] procollagen, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) in both OLETF and LETO rats. In conclusion, pharmacological blockade of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor slows the development of steatohepatitis in the OLETF rat model. This angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker may exert insulin resistance-associated effects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation as well as direct effects against the generation of reactive oxygen species and fibrogenesis."
