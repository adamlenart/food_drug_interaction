    "1": "Participants from the African-American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) trial were genotyped for ADRB1 polymorphisms: Ser49Gly and Arg389Gly. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the relationship between ADRB1 polymorphisms and time to reach a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of \u2264107 mm Hg in the first year after randomization, adjusted for other predictors of blood pressure response.", 
    "2": "In the Ser49Gly model, Ser49/Gly49 individuals were less responsive compared to Ser49/Ser49 only among the more obese (body mass index (BMI) \u226539 kg/m(2)) participants (P < 0.05 for genotype \u00d7 BMI interaction). The hazard ratio (HR) with a BMI of 39 kg/m(2) was 0.68 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.99). In the Arg389Gly model, participants with Arg389 were less likely to respond to metoprolol: HR: 0.68 (95% CI 0.50-0.93). In addition, women were less responsive to metoprolol compared to men: HR: 0.78 (95% CI 0.60-0.995).", 
    "3": "Ser49/Gly49 was predictive of blood pressure response to metoprolol only among more obese African Americans with early hypertensive nephrosclerosis. In contrast to other studies suggesting increased short-term responsiveness to \u03b2-blockers with Arg389, Arg389 individuals were less responsive in this study analyzing blood pressure over a 1-year period. This may be partly explained by decreased agonist-promoted desensitization with Arg389. However, gender, physiological adaption to stress, interactions between genes and between genes and the environment, as well as study in other patient populations need to be considered.", 
    "4": "A novel method for simultaneous determination of atenolol, metoprolol and esmolol was proposed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) separation and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection. Poly-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (Poly-\u03b2-CD) was used as an additive in the running buffer to improve the separation of three analytes. The conditions for CE separation, ECL detection and effect of Poly-\u03b2-CD were investigated in detail. The three \u03b2-blockers with very similar structures were well separated and detected under the optimum conditions. The linear ranges of the standard solution for atenolol and esmolol were 2.5-125 \u03bcmol/L with a detection limit (S/N=3) of 0.5 \u03bcmol/L, and for metoprolol was 0.5-25 \u03bcmol/L with a detection limit of 0.1 \u03bcmol/L. For three \u03b2-blockers from spiked aqueous and urine samples, the accuracy and precision including intraday and interday experiments were performed by calculating the recovery, the relative standard deviations of the ECL intensity and the migration time, respectively. The developed method was applied to the determination of metoprolol content in commercial pharmaceutical, and the analytical results are in good agreement with the nominal value with recoveries in the range of 98.7-105%. The proposed method was also applied to the monitoring of pharmacokinetics for metoprolol in human body.", 
    "5": "James Black has many claims to pharmacological fame as the creator of two new classes of drugs (beta-blockers and H2 antihistamines) and as a tireless innovator in drug discovery strategies and analytical procedures. The latter attributes in particular assisted Black in the invention of the prototypes for the two major classes of drugs for which he is best known, propranolol and cimetidine. The clinical impact of these drugs on both morbidity and mortality has been profound. In addition, the application of his analytical approach to drug discovery and pharmacology led others in the field to create many other new classes of drugs. Shortly before he died in 2010, Black wrote a retrospective review of his research career that provides insight into his innovative thinking and career success. This overview affords readers a very personal picture of the man, his ideas and his contributions.", 
    "6": "It has been over 50years since Sir James Black developed the first beta adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) blocker to treat heart disease. At that time, the concept of cell surface receptors was relatively new and not widely accepted, and most of the tools currently used to characterize plasma membrane receptors had not been developed. There has been remarkable progress in receptor biology since then, including the development of radioligand binding assays, the biochemical characterization of receptors as discrete membrane proteins, and the cloning of the first G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which led to the identification of other members of the large family of GPCRs. More recently, progress in GPCR structural biology has led to insights into the three-dimensional structures of \u03b2ARs in both active and inactive states. Despite all of this progress, the process of developing a drug for a particular GPCR target has become more complex, time-consuming and expensive.", 
    "7": "We aimed to determine whether polymorphisms in chromosome 4q25 are associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), long-term AF, postoperative or long-term stroke, and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass grafting. We performed genotyping for rs2200733 and rs10033464 in white participants (n = 1,166) from the TexGen genetic registry. The development of postoperative or long-term AF, postoperative or long-term stroke, and long-term mortality were ascertained. Both rs2200733 and rs10033464 were associated with postoperative AF (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.91, and OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.06, respectively). Carriers of the risk allele (T) had an increased risk of postoperative AF with preoperative \u03b2 blocker (BB) (for rs2200733, OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.004 to 2.16 for those taking a BB, and OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.73 for those not taking a BB; for rs10033464, OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.93 for those taking preoperative a BB, and OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.65 for those not taking a BB). Both rs2200733 and rs10033464 were also associated with long-term AF (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.67, and hazard ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.66, respectively). Carriers of rs2200733 had increased long-term mortality (hazard ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.24). These variants were not associated with postoperative or long-term stroke. In conclusion, variants in 4q25 are associated with an increased risk of postoperative or long-term AF and, possibly, mortality in whites undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and could potentially affect the choice of therapy used to decrease postoperative AF.", 
    "8": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the vascular effects of heart rate (HR) reduction with BB therapy in African Americans (AA). Beta-blockers (BB) offer less cardiovascular protection than other hypertensive drugs. Studies of Caucasian subjects suggest this may be due to an adverse effect of HR lowering on arterial wave reflection. We studied 506 subjects (age 63 \u00b1 14 years, 52% were treated with BB). Central systolic (C-SBP) and pulse pressure (C-PP), augmented pressure (AP), and augmentation index (AI) were obtained via applanation tonometry (Sphygmocor). On univariate analysis, HR correlated inversely with BB use, C-SBP, AP, and AI (all P < .001), but not P-SBP. Multivariate analysis showed P-SBP and HR to be major determinants of C-SBP (R(2) = 0.95). Generalized linear model analysis showed higher C-SBP (P < .05) and C-PP (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), but similar P-SBP (P = .24) in the BB group. After HR adjustment, differences in C-SBP, C-PP, AI, and AP were attenuated, suggesting HR to be a determinant of C-SBP. BB use is associated with higher C-SBP and lower PPA in hypertensive AA despite similar P-SBP. C-SBP is HR-dependent. HR reduction with BB accounts for less effective central blood pressure control in AA, similar to that reported in Caucasians.", 
    "9": "The absolute number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension is growing worldwide. Many factors may be involved, including physician inertia and patient nonadherence. In this context, we reviewed published studies related to the efficacy and efficiency of starting combination antihypertensive treatment versus mono-therapy. The overall evidence supports that initial combination therapy is more effective for many outcomes (ie, reaching blood pressure targets, rapidity of control, patient adherence, and cardiovascular protection assessed by surrogate markers). The few available published clinical trials and observational studies support that the amlodipine + an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor combination may be the most effective for reducing cardiovascular events. We outline a novel algorithm of starting initial therapy with a single tablet containing amlodipine + benazepril in most patients with hypertension regardless of stage or comorbidities. It is our hypothesis that this streamlined approach is likely to yield an overall positive risk/benefit ratio and that it should be tested in an outcome trial versus accepted monotherapies in stage I hypertension.", 
    "10": "The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT axis and the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) pathway play critical roles in macrophage survival. In cells other than macrophages proper operation of those two pathways requires Ca\u00b2(+) influx into the cell, but if that is the case in macrophages remains unexplored. In the present work we used THP-1-derived macrophages and a pharmacological approach to examine for the first time the role of constitutive, non-regulated Ca\u00b2(+) influx in PI3K/AKT and NF\u03baB signaling. Blocking constitutive function of Ca\u00b2(+)-permeable channels with the organic channel blocker SKF96365 completely prevented phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, AKT and its downstream target BAD in TNF\u03b1-treated macrophages. A similar effect was observed upon treating macrophages with the calmodulin (CAM) inhibitor W-7 or the calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII) inhibitor KN-62. In addition, pre-treating macrophages with SKF96365 significantly enhanced TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that in THP-1-derived macrophages survival signaling depends, to a significant extent, on constitutive Ca\u00b2(+) influx presumably through a mechanism that involves the CAM/CAMKII axis as a coupling component between constitutive Ca\u00b2(+) influx and activation of survival signaling.", 
    "11": "Apelin and its G-protein-coupled receptor APJ are potent regulators of the cardiovascular system. Recent studies have suggested that apelin-APJ reverses the function of angiotensin II (Ang II)-the Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)). However, the mechanism remains unclear because of the accumulating evidences that apelin-APJ may contribute to both cardioprotection and pathological progression. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we found that coexpression with APJ significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) induced by Ang II-AT(1), whereas apelin abolished this attenuation through activated APJ independently of its heterodimerization. Pretreatment with the Gi/o-specific inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX) restituted the ERK1/2 phosphorylation level similar to that found with AT(1) and APJ coexpression without apelin stimulation. In contrast, coexpression of the beta-2-adrenergic receptor or the pharmacologically non-activated Ang II type 2 receptor (AT(2)) pretreated with the AT(2)-specific antagonist, PD123319, did not affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation through AT(1). Pretreatment with 30\u2009nM of the AT(1) blocker (ARB) TA-606A suppressed 50% of the AT(1)-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas 30\u2009nM of TA-606A achieved 75% suppression when the non-activated APJ was coexpressed without ligand or PTX. However, 120\u2009nM of TA-606A failed to reach the target phosphorylation when it was coexpressed with activated APJ with apelin. Based on these results, we demonstrated that non-activated APJ may suppress Ang II-AT(1) signaling, whereas this ligand-independent function was diminished with apelin activation. These results may be relevant to the potential contribution of apelin-APJ to ARB treatment in the clinical realm.",

However, a recent reappraisal of the European Society of Hypertension guidelines highlights that these agents exhibit similar BP lowering efficacy to other classes of agents, prompting a re-examination of the utility of these agents in various patient populations. The authors felt that it is important to address this controversy and provide an Asian perspective on the place of \u03b2-blockers in current clinical practice and the benefits of \u03b2-blockade in selected patient populations. In addition to their use as a potential first-line therapy in uncomplicated hypertension, \u03b2-blockers have a particular role in patients with hypertension and comorbidities such as heart failure or coronary artery disease, including those who had a myocardial infarction. One advantage which \u03b2-blockers offer is the additional protective effects in patients with prior cardiovascular events. Some of the disadvantages attributed to \u03b2-blockers appear more related to the older drugs in this class and further appraisal of the efficacy and safety profile of newer \u03b2-blockers will lend support to the current guideline recommendations in Asian countries and encourage increased appropriate use of \u03b2-blockade in current clinical practice within Asia.",

Application of this therapy resulted in induction of tolerance in fully allogenic and semiallogenic limb allograft transplants. Based on this experience we have found that the bone marrow component of the allograft is essential for tolerance induction and have confirmed that injection of bone marrow of donor origin directly into the bone marrow compartment of allograft recipients resulted in higher chimerism levels. In addition, we have developed a system for isolation of chimeric cells, which are specific for both the donor and recipient, by using magnetic activated cell sorting technique and flow cytometry.

The effect of Telmisartan as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) agonist was also investigated. After 28 days of MI, a significant improvement of survival was observed in the Telmisartan-treated rat group compared with the vehicle control rat group, non-PPAR-\u03b3 agonistic ARB (Losartan)-treated rat group, and Telmisartan plus specific PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist (GW9662)-treated rat group. Although no significant differences of blood pressure or infarct size were observed among these four groups, the Telmisartan group had better systolic and diastolic LV function. There was a significant reduction of the plasma brain natriuretic peptide level, cardiac fibrosis area, infiltration of macrophages, size of cardiomyocytes, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive myocytes, activation of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9 (MMPs-2/9), and expression of transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 (TGF-\u03b21), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and osteopontin (OPN), while expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and activation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was enhanced, in the noninfarcted myocardium of rats from the Telmisartan group compared with the other three groups.

    "44": "Chronic dopamine replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to deleterious motor sequelae known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). No known therapeutic can eliminate LID, but preliminary evidence suggests that dl-1-isopropylamino-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-propanol [(\u00b1)propranolol], a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) antagonist, may reduce LID. The present study used the rat unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD to characterize and localize the efficacy of (\u00b1)propranolol as an adjunct to therapy with L-DOPA. We first determined whether (\u00b1)propranolol was capable of reducing the development and expression of LID without impairing motor performance ON and OFF L-DOPA. Coincident to this investigation, we used reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques to analyze the effects of chronic (\u00b1)propranolol on markers of striatal activity known to be involved in LID. To determine whether (\u00b1)propranolol reduces LID through \u03b2AR blockade, we subsequently examined each enantiomer separately because only the (-)enantiomer has significant \u03b2AR affinity. We next investigated the effects of a localized striatal \u03b2AR blockade on LID by cannulating the region and microinfusing (\u00b1)propranolol before systemic L-DOPA injections. Results showed that a dose range of (\u00b1)propranolol reduced LID without deleteriously affecting motor activity. Pharmacologically, only (-)propranolol had anti-LID properties indicating \u03b2AR-specific effects. Aberrant striatal signaling associated with LID was normalized with (\u00b1)propranolol cotreatment, and intrastriatal (\u00b1)propranolol was acutely able to reduce LID. This research confirms previous work suggesting that (\u00b1)propranolol reduces LID through \u03b2AR antagonism and presents novel evidence indicating a potential striatal locus of pharmacological action.", 
    "45": "Previous work has shown that the effect of opioid-receptor blockade on memory modulation is critically dependent upon the intensity of stress. The current study determined the effect of adrenergic-receptor blockade on memory modulation under varied levels of stress and then compared the effect of adrenergic-receptor blockade under intense stress to that of a) opioid-receptor blockade and b) concurrent opioid- and adrenergic-receptor blockade. In the first experiment, the \u03b2-adrenergic-receptor blocker propranolol impaired retention in the passive-avoidance procedure when administered immediately after exposure to intense stress (passive-avoidance training followed by swim stress) but not mild stress (passive-avoidance training alone). In the second experiment, while separate administration of either propranolol or the opioid-receptor blocker naloxone immediately after exposure to intense stress impaired retention, the combined administration of propranolol and naloxone failed to do so. These findings demonstrate that the effect of \u03b2-adrenergic-receptor blockade or opioid-receptor blockade on memory modulation in the passive-avoidance procedure is dependent upon the intensity of stress, and suggest that concurrent inactivation of endogenous adrenergic- and opioid-based memory modulation systems under stressful conditions is protective of memory.",

Matrix tablets of various combinations were prepared with cellulose-based polymers: hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and ethyl cellulose (EC); and lactose and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate (DCP) as fillers. Study of pre-compression and post-compression parameters facilitated the screening of a formulation with best characteristics that underwent here optimization study by response surface methodology (Central Composite Design). The optimized tablet was subjected to further study like scanning electron microscopy, swelling study and in vivo study in rabbit model. Both in vitro and in vivo study revealed that combining of HPMC K100M (21.95%) with EC (8.85%), and use of DCP as filler sustained the action up to 12 h. The in vivo study of new SR tablets showed significant improvement in the oral bioavailability of MS in rabbits after a single oral dose of 25 mg. The delayed T(max) and lower C(max) indicated a slow and SR of MS from the optimized matrix tablets in comparison with the immediate release dosage form.

    "54": "It is well-known that cancer surgery can actually promote the growth of some tumors by a variety of mechanisms. There are observational data suggesting that surgery per se can increase the risk of cancer among individuals without a history of clinical cancer. Occult microscopic cancers are exceedingly common in the general population and are held in a dormant state by a balance between cell proliferation and cell death and also an intact host immune surveillance. The catecholamine surge from the stress of surgery and resulting \u03b2(2)-adrenergic signaling culminates in a transient and robust increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression locally and systemically that is enough to start tumor angiogenesis and end dormancy. The same catecholamine surge and \u03b2(2)-adrenergic signaling impairs cell-mediated immunity at a crucial time. Elegant animal studies have demonstrated that perioperative nonselective \u03b2-blockade abrogates surgical stress-induced angiogenesis and tumor growth. Prospective human trials are desperately needed and clinical implications are discussed.", 
    "55": "The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a familial disorder characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG and occurrence of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias especially, but not only, under conditions of increased sympathetic activity. Symptomatic untreated patients are at high risk for sudden cardiac death. Twelve LQTS genes have been identified and most of them encode cardiac ion channels. Very effective therapies are available and in carefully treated patients mortality is around 0.5-1% over 20 years. The initial treatment should always involve \u03b2-blockers, with propranolol and nadolol being the two most effective ones. With few exceptions all mutation carriers should be treated because of the risk of sudden death during the first cardiac event. Approximately 20% of patients continue to have syncope despite the \u03b2-blockers and the most rationale next level of therapy is represented by Left Cardiac Sympathetic Denervation (LCSD), which is highly effective and can complement any other therapy. One important limitation of LCSD is that, without valid reasons, it is available only in a few selected centers. Whenever syncope recurs despite LCSD, or whenever an aborted cardiac arrest has occurred, it becomes logical to resort to the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The latter, however, is burdened by a high rate (31%) of adverse events including severe ones such as endocarditis, inappropriate shocks, and by the need of frequent battery replacements. A scoring system, based on simple clinical variables, can identify the patients more and less likely to benefit from ICD implantation.",

However, the mechanism of induction is yet to be established. In this study, siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) targeted against \u03b2ig-h3 were transfected into SMMC-7721 cells [a HCC (human hepatocellular carcinoma) cell line] to knockdown the expression of \u03b2ig-h3. We found that NiCl2, a potent blocker of extracellular Ca2+ entry, reduced \u03b2ig-h3-induced secretion of MMP-2 and -9. Further investigation suggested that reduction in the levels of \u03b2ig-h3 decreased the secretion of MMP-2 and -9 that was enhanced by an increase in the concentration of extracellular Ca2+. SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine), a NO (nitric oxide) donor, and 8-Br-cGMP (8-bromo-cGMP) inhibited thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ entry and MMP secretion in the invasive potential of human SMMC-7721 cells. Further, the inhibitory effects of 8-Br-cGMP and SNAP could be significantly enhanced by down-regulating \u03b2ig-h3. \u03b2ig-h3 attenuates the negative regulation of NO/cGMP-sensitive store-operated Ca2+ entry. Our findings suggest that the expression of \u03b2ig-h3 might play an important role in the regulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry to increase the invasive potential of HCC cells.",

    "78": "Glaucoma is a common eye disease that can cause irreversible blindness if not diagnosed and treated in the early stages of progression. This disease is often, albeit not always, associated with increased intraocular pressure, which is also the most important risk factor for glaucoma. Currently, the only treatment option of glaucoma is reduction of intraocular pressure. A \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist, timolol, has been used for the treatment of glaucoma and increased intraocular pressure for more than 30 years and still remains the drug of choice. Locally, timolol is well tolerated. However, it has been reported that approximately 80% of a topically administered eye drop is systemically absorbed. Thus, ophthalmic timolol may cause severe adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects. On the basis of the aforementioned situation, it is somewhat surprising to notice that the metabolism of timolol has only recently been studied in detail even though the drug has been used for decades. Earlier clinical studies have suggested that timolol is metabolized by CYP2D6, an important member of the cytochrome P450 family. Our recent in vitro studies demonstrated convincingly that CYP2D6 is the main enzyme contributing to timolol metabolism, although also CYP2C19 may have a minor role. Liver is the principal site of timolol metabolism, because - according to our recent findings - only negligible amounts of CYP2D6 are expressed in human ocular tissues. After topical administration, systemic timolol concentrations may be high enough to cause cardiovascular and respiratory adverse effects especially in patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers or use concomitant CYP2D6 inhibitors.",

This multicenter retrospective study describes the efficacy and adverse effects of propranolol in infantile hemangioma. Seventy-one infants with infantile hemangiomas were treated with oral propranolol, 1 mg/kg/12 hours, for at least 12 weeks. A photograph based severity scoring assessment was performed by five observers to evaluate efficacy, utilizing a scoring system of 10 as the original infantile hemangioma before treatment and 0 as completely normal skin. The mean of the five independent measurements was used in the analysis. Propranolol was a rapid and effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas at 4 weeks (p < 0.001), at 8 weeks (p < 0.001 compared to the 4 wks value), at 12 weeks (p < 0.05 compared to the 8 wks value), and thereafter up to 32 weeks (p < 0.01 compared to the 16 wks value). The response of infantile hemangiomas to propranolol was similar regardless of sex, age at onset of treatment, type of involvement (segmental and nonsegmental), facial segments affected, special locations (eyelid, nasal tip, and parotid region), ulceration, and depth of infantile hemangiomas. Very few side effects were reported; mainly agitated sleep in 10 of 71 patients. In the series of patients in this study, oral propranolol 2 mg/kg/day was a well-tolerated and effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas.

However, previous studies assessing the effects of such compounds in fish have not taken into account the potential for metabolism and elimination. This study aimed to assess if propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist or \u03b2-blocker, could modulate EROD activity (indicative of CYP1A activity) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gills and liver. For this, an in vivo time course exposure with 1 mg/L was conducted. Additionally, using measured in vivo plasma concentrations, an in vitro exposure at human therapeutic levels was undertaken. This allowed comparison of in vitro and in vivo rates of EROD activity, thus investigating the applicability of cell preparations as surrogates for whole animal enzyme activity analysis. In vitro exposure of suspended liver and gill cells at concentrations similar to in vivo levels resulted in EROD activity in both tissues, but with significantly higher rates (up to six times in vivo levels). These results show that propranolol exposure elevated EROD activity in the liver and gill of rainbow trout, and that this is demonstrable both in vivo (albeit nonsignificantly in the liver) and in vitro, thus supporting the use of the latter as a surrogate of the former. These data also provide an insight into the potential role of the gill as a site of metabolism of pharmaceuticals in trout, suggesting that propranolol (and feasibly other pharmaceuticals) may undergo \"first pass\" metabolism in this organ.",

We analysed which clinical factors are associated with underutilization of evidence-based therapies in women. Methods and results From the Canadian Registry of ACS I and II, 6558 patients (4471 men and 2087 women) with a final diagnosis of ACS were selected for the current analysis. Covariates were chosen using the approach described by Blackstone. The final selected model included 23 patient clinical variables. Women were less likely than men to receive beta-blockers (75.76 vs. 79.24%; P < 0.01), lipid-modifying agents (56.37 vs. 65.44%; P < 0.0001), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors (55.52 vs. 59.99%; P < 0.01). Female sex and clinical decision not to investigate with cardiac catheterization were the strongest independent predictors for not receiving lipid-modifying agents and ACE-inhibitors. Age, Killip class 2, and Killip class 3/4 were significant independent predictors of underutilization of beta-blocker use. Women were older (69 \u00b1 12 vs. 64 \u00b1 12; P < 0.01) with a higher prevalence of Killip class \u2265 2 (19.95 vs. 15.54%; P < 0.068), and they were less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization (41.9 vs. 49.6 %; P < 0.001). Conclusions The current findings demonstrate that underutilization of evidence-based therapies in women with ACS compared with men is associated with multiple factors related to the patient (age), the consequences of the disease (congestive heart failure), and the physician's assessment of patient risk (decision to catheterize). Female gender remains associated with underutilization of lipid-modifying agents and ACE-inhibitors despite adjustment for these confounders.", 
    "87": "Together with an expert committee a structured approach to determining quality indicators for National Disease Management Guidelines has been developed. The key steps of this approach include: introducing guideline authors to the methodology at an early stage of the process of guideline development, pre-selecting recommendations of the guideline which are potentially measurable by means of quality indicators, assessing the potentially measurable quality indicators in written form using five criteria (including their importance for the health care system and clarity of definitions) and approving them in a formal consensus process. For lack of a database these quality indicators must be regarded as preliminary. For the National Disease Management Guideline \"Chronic Heart Failure\" nine rate-based indicators have been chosen. The indicators correspond to important strong recommendations (grade of recommendation: A) from the fields of diagnosis (two), general therapeutic strategy (two), specific treatment (three), clinical monitoring (one) and co-ordination of care (one). In a second step, the quality indicators have to be validated within a pilot project.

The availability of numerators and denominators needed for calculating the four quality indicators for diagnosis and pharmacotherapy proposed in the DM-CPG was checked within so-called \"routine data\" from the existing dataset of the CONTENT project.

A thorough assessment has revealed that within the given context only one indicator could be deduced from routine data collection. This was the indicator measuring the proportion of patients receiving beta receptor antagonists, compared to all patients with heart failure NYHA class II to IV. Indeed, this single indicator will only be computable if the NYHA grade of heart failure severity and the presence or absence of contraindications to beta receptor antagonist therapy are routinely collected and the data merged into a central database. Against the background of these results it is obvious that a fully developed, transsectoral concept for data collection and data transfer needs to be implemented.", 
    "89": "Arterial hypertension is frequently observed in renal transplant recipients. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial in most cases. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) can increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing arteriolar vasoconstriction and can cause extracellular fluid expansion by reducing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), activating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and by inactivating the atrial natriuretic peptide. Glucocorticoids can impair urinary water and salt excretion. Poor graft function can lead to increased extracellular volume and inappropriate production of renin. Native kidneys, older age of the donor and transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) may also contribute to the development of hypertension. Arterial hypertension not only can increases the risk for cardiovascular events but can also deteriorate renal allograft function. A number of studies have shown that the higher the levels of blood pressure are, the higher is the risk of graft failure. On the other hand, a good control of blood pressure may prevent many cardiovascular and renal complications. Appropriate lifestyle modification is the first step for treating hypertension. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are the most frequently used antihypertensive agents, but in many cases, a combination of these and other drugs is required to obtain good control of hypertension.", 
    "90": "Valsartan has significant blood pressure lowering effect via modulating renin-angiotensin system although its mechanism of action in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury is largely unknown. We therefore evaluated the effect of valsartan in ISO-induced oxidative stress and cardiotoxicity during \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation in rats. ISO (85\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) was administered on thirteenth and fourteenth day for induction of cardiotoxicity. ISO-treated rats showed significant decrease (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in mean arterial pressure (70.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.11 vs. 104.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.93), maximal positive (1601.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0338.87 vs. 2789.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0301.76), and negative (1495.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0151.78 vs. 2039.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0279.1) rate of developed left ventricular pressure and increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (5.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51 vs. 2.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43) as compared to the sham group. Similarly, significant reduction in CK-MB (91.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.88 vs. 142.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9), LDH (50.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.18 vs. 73.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.29) levels, and anti-oxidant enzymes activities were observed. Valsartan (15, 30, and 60\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o.) pretreatment for 14\u00a0days favorably modulated these altered parameters. However, valsartan (60\u00a0mg/kg) only showed significant improvement (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury markers, and anti-oxidant status of myocardium in ISO-induced cardiotoxicity. Histopathology and ultrastructural studies further validated the protective effect of valsartan (60\u00a0mg/kg). Altogether, these results suggest that cardioprotective effect of valsartan is mediated through augmenting endogenous anti-oxidant defense system, preserving hemodynamic function and structural integrity of myocardium.", 
    "91": "A 109-year-old woman was hospitalized with myocardial infarction in the geriatric long-term care ward of our hospital. Her medical history was unknown, and she was receiving only peroral 20 mg/day furosemide. Her medical records at another hospital revealed that she had been given a previous diagnosis of myocardial infarction of the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle by a cardiovascular specialist approximately 10 years previously. Although treatment with cardiovascular drugs such as an angiotensin II receptor blocker, aspirin, and spironolactone had been started, it was discontinued because of her hospital transfer and change in her attending physician. Because of aggravation of the symptoms of cardiac failure caused by infection, treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor temocapril (1 mg/day), spironolactone (12.5 mg/day), aspirin (100 mg/day), and a beta-adrenoceptor blocker carvedilol (2 mg/day) was tentatively initiated. Consequently, her B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level improved and her condition stabilized. She finally died of old age. Both inappropriate sharing of patient information among medical facilities and restrictions on medical care in Japanese health care system for the elderly may lead to improper and/or inadequate medical treatment for elderly patients. Although little evidence is available to support medical care for centenarians, treatment which is based on a thorough understanding of their physiological characteristics enables us to improve their quality of life.",

    "96": "The introduction of beta-blockers in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases was a milestone and one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine in the 20th century. For many years, beta-blockers were considered contraindicated in patients with chronic heart failure owing to the negative inotropic action of these substances. With increasing evidence of neurohormonal activation in heart failure patients, there was a focus on the potential role of beta-blockers in the treatment of chronic heart failure. Several large randomized placebo- controlled clinical trials have shown favorable effects of beta-blockers on mortality and morbidity in heart failure patients with impaired systolic function. Beneficial effects in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function are less clear. A reduction in heart rate is one of several mechanisms by which beta-blockers exert beneficial effects in chronic heart failure. In this article we present results from major clinical trials examining beta-blocker treatment in chronic heart failure patients and discuss heart rate as a therapeutic target in these patients.",

The underlying causes, such as thyroiditis, metastatic thyroid cancer and struma ovarii were explored. Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, particularly factitious hyperthyroidism was highly suspected, but there was no direct evidence to establish these diagnoses. In spite of good compliance, their thyrotoxicosis could not be controlled with large doses of PTU or MMI. \u03b2-blocker, methylprednisolone, radio-iodine therapy and even thyroidectomy were all attempted and failed. Short-acting octreotide was first administered to case 1 and then to case 2. Thyroid function improved greatly within 3 days in both cases. The doses of octreotide were tapered down to twice a week with consistent efficacy. During the follow-up periods, case 1 required octreotide 0.1mg twice per week and case 2 is on thyroid replacement therapy due to hypothyroidism. The recurrences of hyperthyroidism in both cases were again rapidly controlled with the increased dose of octreotide in case 1 and re-started the usage of octreotide in case 2.", 
    "100": "The etiology of thyrotoxicosis in these 2 cases is not clear. In the absence of struma ovarii or wide-spread follicular thyroid cancer, factitious hyperthyroidism due to Munchausen syndrome should be considered first.

High-risk inpatients with perioperative \u03b2-blockade were divided into two groups: patients who received perioperative atenolol only and those who received metoprolol only. Patients who switched between the two chronic oral \u03b2-blocker medications were excluded. IV administration of \u03b2-blockers was ignored.

Non-selective \u03b2-blockers are currently the drugs of choice for preventing first variceal bleeding. Endoscopic rubber band ligation of high risk varices features as a first line option if cirrhotic patients cannot tolerate \u03b2-blockers. Despite adequate \u03b2-blockade, some patients may still present with variceal bleeding. The effect of carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2 and \u03b1-1 receptor-blocker, on lowering portal pressure has been investigated in several clinical trials and found to be superior to propranolol in both acute and chronic hemodynamic studies. Recently, carvedilol has also been compared with band ligation for primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding with equivalent results to band ligation. Patient tolerance to carvedilol in advanced liver disease remains a source of concern. This review examines the place of carvedilol as an alternative to the currently recommended pharmacological therapy in prophylaxis against variceal bleeding.", 
    "114": "Angiotensin II type I receptor blocker and iron chelator reportedly exert suppressive effects on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) progression, including liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the combined effect of losartan (LOS), an angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, and deferasirox (DSX), a newly developed oral iron chelator, on the progression of NASH in rats. To induce NASH, F344 rats were fed a choline-deficient l-amino acid-defined diet for 12 wk, and the effects of LOS and DSX at clinically comparable low doses were elucidated in conjunction with oxidative stress, neovascularization, and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation, all known to play important roles in the progression of NASH. Treatment with both LOS and DSX suppressed choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet-induced liver fibrosis development and hepatocarcinogenesis. This combination treatment exerted a stronger inhibitory effect compared with treatment with a single agent. These inhibitory effects occurred almost concurrently with the suppression of oxidative stress, neovascularization, and HSC activation. Our in vitro study demonstrated that LOS and DSX inhibited angiotensin II-induced proliferation, transforming growth factor-\u03b2(1) expression of activated HSC, and in vitro angiogenesis. These results indicated that dual inhibition by combined treatment of LOS and DSX attenuated the progression of NASH. Since both agents are widely used in clinical practice, this combination therapy may represent a potential new strategy against NASH in the near future.", 
    "115": "The present study investigated whether memory for extinction in an appetitive task (the sand maze) could be attenuated by administration of cycloheximide (protein synthesis inhibitor) or propranolol (\u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist). Ninety-day-old male Long-Evans rats were trained to retrieve a sweet cereal reinforcer from an open container in the sand maze. One day following this non-spatial training, rats received three extinction trials in which they were placed in the maze with the reinforcer present, but unattainable. Thirty minutes prior to the first extinction trial, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of cycloheximide (1mg/kg), propranolol (25mg/kg), or vehicle (1mg/kg distilled water). Twenty-four hours later, rats were tested in the sand maze with the reinforcer again available. Results from the test trial showed that both cycloheximide and propranolol groups found the reinforcer more quickly than controls. Two weeks later, rats were trained on a spatial version of the sand maze in which they had to search for a buried reinforcer using extramaze cues. Cycloheximide and propranolol groups learned this task significantly faster than the control group, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of cycloheximide and propranolol on the blocking of memory for extinction.", 
    "116": "Hydrogen sulphide (H(2)S) is an endogenous mediator producing a potent relaxation response in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscles. While ATP-sensitive potassium channels are mainly involved in this relaxant effect in vascular smooth muscle, the mechanism in other smooth muscles has not been revealed yet. In the present study, we investigated how H(2)S relaxes non-vascular smooth muscle by using intact and \u03b2-escin permeabilized guinea-pig taenia caecum. In intact tissues, concentration-dependent relaxation response to H(2)S donor NaHS in carbachol-precontracted preparations did not change in the presence of a K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide, adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ-22536, guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, protein kinase A inhibitor KT-5720, protein kinase C inhibitor H-7, tetrodotoxin, apamin/charybdotoxin, NOS inhibitor L-NAME and cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. We then studied how H(2)S affected carbachol- or Ca(2+)-induced contractions in permeabilized tissues. When Ca(2+) was clamped to a constant value (pCa6), a further contraction could be elicited by carbachol that was decreased by NaHS. This decrease in contraction was reversed by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase or N-acetyl cysteine. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pump inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid, also decreased the carbachol-induced contraction that was further inhibited by NaHS. Mitochondrial proton pump inhibitor carbonyl cyanide p-trifluromethoxyphenylhydrazone also decreased the carbachol-induced contraction but this was not additionally changed by NaHS. The carbachol-induced Ca(2+) sensitization, calcium concentration-response curves, IP(3)- and caffeine-induced contractions were not affected by NaHS. In conclusion, we propose that hydrogen peroxide and mitochondria may have a role in H(2)S-induced relaxation response in taenia caecum.",

    "118": "An 83-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our hospital for anemia and a positive fecal occult blood test. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed small varices without bleeding signs and hypertensive gastropathy. Colonoscopy was negative. To rule out any other cause of bleeding, capsule endoscopy was performed; capsule endoscopy revealed severe hyperemia of the jejunum-ileal mucosa with active bleeding. Because of the persistence of anemia and the frequent blood transfusions, not responding to \u03b2-blocker drugs or octreotide infusion, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was performed. Anemia improved quickly after the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and no further blood transfusion was necessary in the follow-up. The patient developed portal encephalopathy two months later and was readmitted to our department. We repeated the capsule endoscopy that showed a significant improvement of the gastric and ileal mucosa without any signs of bleeding.", 
    "119": "Hypertensive enteropathy is a rare condition, but it seems more common with the introduction of capsule endoscopy in clinical practice. This case shows that the jejunum can be a source of bleeding in cirrhosis patients, and this is the first demonstration of its resolution after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement.", 
    "120": "We performed a retrospective chart review with a 6-month follow-up to examine the initial use of propranolol as an adjunctive treatment in children with severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. This is the first such report. Two of 3 children with severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis demonstrated a response to oral propranolol therapy, as evidenced by an improved voice and by an increased time between surgical interventions. One child demonstrated no response to propranolol, and medication was halted. Both children who demonstrated a response had undergone more than 10 surgical interventions in the previous year, along with prior treatment including surgical excision and adjuvant therapy. Both children more than doubled the interval between treatments after propranolol administration, and the parents of both children noted marked improvement of the child's voice as measured by their Pediatric Voice-Related Quality of Life score (from 40 to 67.5 in one child and from 27 to 60 in the other child). No child experienced hypoglycemia or blood pressure abnormalities. We conclude that initial use of propranolol as an adjunctive measure in severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis shows it to have some efficacy in delaying surgical intervention and improving voice. Previous reports have demonstrated relatively safe use of propranolol in children with hemangiomas. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effectiveness, dosing strategies, and side-effect profile of propranolol for treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.", 
    "121": "\u03b2-Adrenergic blockers or \u03b2-blockers have been used therapeutically to treat human hypertension since the late 1960s. The global market value and prescription rates of \u03b2-blockers keep rising substantially each year, and over the past decade the number of prescriptions has doubled. The widespread use of \u03b2-blockers has resulted in their appearance in the aquatic environment originating primarily from sewage effluents. The objective of this review is to analyze the literature as a means to determine the endocrine-disrupting potential of \u03b2-blockers in aquatic organisms. The mammalian adrenergic system is compared with the adrenergic system of fish and the homologous octopaminergic system in aquatic invertebrates, in particular mollusks. The structure and functions of these systems are linked to the molecular similarities between adrenoceptors and the octopaminergic/tyraminergic receptors, the various catecholamine molecules (epinephrine, norepinephrine, octopamine, and tyramine), and the processes controlled. Knowledge of these similarities as well as the effects of \u03b2-blockers, mainly in humans, is then used to create a broad picture of the endocrine-disrupting potential of \u03b2-blockers, particularly during the stress response. The main conclusion is that \u03b2-blockers have endocrine-disrupting effects.", 
    "122": "Activation of the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has been shown to promote cellular energetic collapse and cellular necrosis in various forms of critical illness. Most of the evidence implicating the PARP pathway in disease processes is derived from preclinical studies. With respect to PARP and burns, studies in rodent and large animal models of burn injury have demonstrated the activation of PARP in various tissues and the beneficial effect of its pharmacological inhibition. The aims of the current study were to measure the activation of PARP in human skeletal muscle biopsies at various stages of severe pediatric burn injury and to identify the cell types where this activation may occur. Another aim of the study was to test the effect of propranolol (an effective treatment of patients with burns) on the activation of PARP in skeletal muscle biopsies. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation was measured by Western blotting for its product, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). The localization of PARP activation was determined by PAR immunohistochemistry. The results showed that PARP becomes activated in the skeletal muscle tissue after burns, with the peak of the activation occurring in the middle stage of the disease (13-18 days after burns). Even at the late stage of the disease (69-369 days after burn), an elevated degree of PARP activation persisted in some of the patients. Immunohistochemical studies localized the staining of PAR primarily to vascular endothelial cells and occasionally to resident mononuclear cells. There was a marked suppression of PARP activation in the skeletal muscle biopsies of patients who received propranolol treatment. We conclude that human burn injury is associated with the activation of PARP. We hypothesize that this response may contribute to the inflammatory responses and cell dysfunction in burns. Some of the clinical benefit of propranolol in burns may be related to its inhibitory effect on PARP activation.",

CDI was performed on nine Beagle dogs, and RI values were calculated for the medial long posterior ciliary artery before and after the administration of anti-glaucoma drugs. A significant increase in RI values was found after topical administration of levobunolol (p < 0.05) or dipivefrin (p < 0.05). Pilocarpine showed no effects on RI values after topical administration. The results suggest that some anti-glaucoma drugs could affect ophthalmic blood flow.",

Relative to controls (including the patient's mother), multi-electrode array and patch-clamp electrophysiology of LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes showed prolonged field/action potential duration. When LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes were exposed to E4031 (an I(Kr) blocker), arrhythmias developed and these presented as early after depolarizations (EADs) in the action potentials. In contrast to control cardiomyocytes, LQT2-hiPSC cardiomyocytes also developed EADs when challenged with the clinically used stressor, isoprenaline. This effect was reversed by \u03b2-blockers, propranolol, and nadolol, the latter being used for the patient's therapy. Treatment of cardiomyocytes with experimental potassium channel enhancers, nicorandil and PD118057, caused action potential shortening and in some cases could abolish EADs. Notably, combined treatment with isoprenaline (enhancers/isoprenaline) caused EADs, but this effect was reversed by nadolol.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate how high levels of epinephrine compromise the activity of murine dermal fibroblasts. Dermal fibroblasts isolated from the skin of neonatal Swiss mice were preincubated with \u03b1- or \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Thereafter, cells were exposed to physiologically elevated levels of epinephrine or epinephrine plus \u03b1- or \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, and fibroblast activity was evaluated. The blockade of \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoceptors reversed the increase in fibroblast proliferation, ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, myofibroblastic differentiation and the reduction of collagen deposition induced by epinephrine. In addition, the blockade of \u03b23-adrenoceptors reversed the increase in fibroblast proliferation and nitric oxide synthesis as well as the reduction of fibroblast migration, AKT phosphorylation and active matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression induced by epinephrine. However, the blockade of \u03b11- and \u03b12-adrenoceptors did not alter the effects of epinephrine on the activity of murine dermal fibroblasts. In conclusion, high levels of epinephrine directly compromise the activity of neonatal mouse skin fibroblasts through the activation of \u03b21-, \u03b22- and \u03b23-adrenoceptors, but not through \u03b11- and \u03b12-adrenoceptors.",

Characterization of the liposomal drug formulation using CE instrumentation encompassed: determination of the electrophoretic mobilities, size determination by Taylor dispersion analysis and interaction studies. Electrophoretic mobilities determined by CE were compared with the results obtained by laser Doppler electrophoresis, which were found to be subject to larger variation. Average hydrodynamic diameters of the liposome preparations, as determined by Taylor dispersion analysis, were in the range of 61-84 nm and were compared with the results obtained by dynamic light scattering. Interactions between oxaliplatin (and paracetamol) and the PEGylated liposome were non-detectable by CE frontal analysis as well as by liposome electrokinetic chromatography. In contrast, for the more lipophilic compound propranolol, apparent liposome-aqueous phase distribution coefficients (D(lip) ) were successfully determined by both electrokinetic chromatography (log\u2009D(lip) =2.10) and by CE frontal analysis (log\u2009D(lip) =2.14).

In this study, the HRV response to standing 4 days following CABG surgery in men and women prescribed d,l-sotalol was measured to examine the influence of d,l-sotalol on previously reported HRV responses, taking age and gender into consideration. Participants included 28 men and 10 women who completed testing in supine and standing postures; all had received low-dose d,l-sotalol daily since the first postoperative day. Data included continuous electrocardiograph recording of R-R interval for 10 min in each posture. Participants showed significant effects of standing on the autonomic modulation of HR, as seen by a decrease in parasympathetic indices and R-R interval and an increase in BP. In men, standing decreased parasympathetic modulation and increased the sympathetic nervous system indicator, but previously reported age effects were not seen. In women, standing decreased low frequency power and R-R interval and increased BP, with older women having a smaller increase in BP, suggesting an attenuated response. The differential autonomic nervous system modulation of HR as a function of gender and age after CABG surgery may be attenuated by d,l-sotalol.",

VS-1 was given alone in groups I-II while in presence of either phentolamine, phentolamine plus propranolol or hexamethonium in groups III-V. Serum VS-1 peaked at 2 \u03bcg/ml (200 nM) before onset of vascular effects and declined rapidly to ~200 ng/ml within 30 min. In all groups but III and IV VS-1 induced a brief vasoconstriction, being larger in intact than in sympathetically decentralized beds. The VS-1 induced vasoconstriction was not altered by hexamethonium but was abolished by phentolamine. In presence of the \u03b1-adrenergic blocker a long lasting vasodilatation, unaffected by propranolol, was apparent on both innervated and decentralized sides. In conclusion, VS-1 induced an \u03b1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction presumably brought about by noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves when infused at a dose giving an initial serum concentration of ~200 nM. This initial vasoconstriction masked a persistent adrenoceptor-independent vasodilatation, consistent with previous reports from in vitro models.",

Recently reported beneficial effects of propranolol may extend beyond the proliferative phase of infantile hemangiomas. The purpose of the study was to assess the effect of oral propranolol therapy for infantile hemangiomas beyond the proliferative phase of these lesions. Members of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology were invited to participate in a multicenter retrospective study. Only children with infantile hemangiomas with documented cessation of lesions' growth or those older than 12 months of age were eligible for the study. Clinical and demographic information and digital photographs before, at the start, and following the treatment were collected. Scaled panels of photographs were distributed among preselected experienced pediatric dermatologists. Visual analog scale was used to assess photographs for each case. Paired t-test was used for statistical analyses. Data on 49 eligible patients from eight pediatric dermatology centers was collected. Seven cases were excluded because of insufficient photographic documentation. The age of the patients at the start of propranolol therapy ranged 7 to 120 months (mean 28 mos, median 22 mos). The duration of propranolol therapy ranged 1 to 8 months (mean 3.6 mos). The mean visual analog scale score before the treatment was 6.8 \u00b1 2.15, and mean reduction in the visual analog scale score at the assessment was 2.6 \u00b1 1.74 (p < 0.001). The rate of visual analog scale reduction was 0.4 per month before the start of the therapy, while this rate was accelerated to 0.9 per months following the therapy (p < 0.001). No significant side effects were reported. We conclude that propranolol is effective in infantile hemangiomas, including post-proliferative phase, and should be considered as the first-line therapy in that setting.",

Expansion of polyglutamine tracts in htt results in neurodegenerative Huntington disease. Huntingtin interacting protein (HIP14) is an important interacting partner of htt and the altered interactions have been proposed to play an important role in disease progression. In the present study, an attempt has been made to explore the potential of several known Huntington inhibitors to inhibit HIP14. The docking studies have resulted in the identification of a novel binding site for these inhibitors distinct from the previously known ankyrin repeat domain. The results have been validated using geometry based docking transformations against the other binding pocket. The specificity of binding has been determined with high values of both accuracy and precision. Nine potential inhibitors obtained after screening belong to three distinct classes of compounds viz, carbohydrates (deoxy-glucose), alcohols (including phenolic scaffold) and tetracycline. The compounds form stable complex with protein exhibiting optimal intermolecular and Gibbs free energy. The hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions predominantly contribute to the stability of these complexes. The present study identifies metoprolol, minocyclines and 18 F fluorodeoxyglucose as the best inhibitors that bind specifically to the new site. Therefore, these compounds can further be exploited for their potential to serve in the diagnosis and treatment of Huntington disease. The quantitative predictions provide a scope for experimental testing in future.",

In contrast, the reduction of the estradiol secretion rate was blocked by yohimbine but not by prazosin.

Second, decision making about heart failure drug therapy often involved a complex and overlapping series of considerations. Five categories of reasons for not prescribing ACE inhibitors or \u00e2-blockers emerged: (1) adverse effects of drug therapy; (2) nonadherence to therapeutic and monitoring plan; (3) patients' preferences and beliefs; (4) comanagement and transitions of care; and (5) prioritization and patient benefit.",

    "157": "Touch is detected through receptors located in the skin and the activation of channels in sensory nerve fibres. Epidermal keratinocytes themselves, however, may sense mechanical stimulus and contribute to skin sensation. Here, we showed that the mechanical stimulation of human keratinocytes by hypo-osmotic shock releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and increases intracellular calcium. We demonstrated that the release of ATP was found to be calcium independent because emptying the intracellular calcium stores did not cause ATP release; ATP release was still observed in the absence of external calcium and it persisted on chelating cytosolic calcium. On the other hand, the released ATP activated purinergic receptors and mobilized intracellular calcium stores. The resulting depletion of stored calcium led to the activation of capacitative calcium entry. Increase in cytosolic calcium concentration was blocked by the purinergic receptor blocker suramin, phospholipase C inhibitor and apyrase, which hydrolyses ATP. Collectively, our data demonstrate that human keratinocytes are mechanically activated by hypo-osmotic shock, leading first to the release of ATP, which in turn stimulates purinergic receptors, resulting in the mobilization of intracellular calcium and capacitative calcium entry. These results emphasize the crucial role of ATP signalling in the transduction of mechanical stimuli in human keratinocytes.",

Despite its positive impact on the 3Rs (reduce, replace and refine), its uptake in exploratory drug discovery has been limited due mainly to protracted method development time in bioanalysis but also the need for small volumes (<20 \u03bcL) to be sampled manually. Automatic blood sampling technology such as the DiLab(\u00ae) AccuSampler(\u00ae) is widely used in drug discovery to facilitate exploratory rodent-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies with minimal animal handling. Propranolol was orally administered to a Han-Wistar rat attached to either a standard DiLab(\u00ae) AccuSampler(\u00ae) or a retrofitted unit designed to directly collect the DBS samples. In all, 50 or 20 \u03bcL blood samples were then collected via the standard or retrofitted unit, respectively, at six timepoints over a 7 h period. After drying and storage the DBS samples were analysed for propranolol via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In this report we demonstrate that a standard DiLab(\u00ae) AccuSampler(\u00ae) can be easily retrofitted to facilitate automatic dried blood spot sampling and that time-concentration data generated from these samples are equivalent to that from manually spotted samples.",

A mechanistic mathematical model based on Fick's law of diffusion was used to quantify the experimentally measured release of metoprolol succinate from various types of systems. With increasing Eudragit NE content the films became more hydrophobic, resulting in decreased water permeability as well as water uptake rates and extents. In addition, the dry mass loss upon exposure to the release medium decreased. Consequently, the films' permeability for the drug decreased. Importantly, metoprolol succinate release from thin films was mainly controlled by pure diffusion, allowing for the determination of the apparent diffusion coefficient of the drug in the different polymeric systems. Knowing these values, drug release from coated pellets could be quantitatively predicted, assuming intact film coatings throughout the observation period. Comparison with independent experimental results showed that crack formation set on very rapidly in the polymeric membranes upon exposure to the release medium in the case of sugar starter cores, irrespective of the polymer:polymer blend ratio and investigated coating level. In contrast, the onset of crack formation was delayed as a function of the blend ratio and coating thickness in the case of microcrystalline cellulose starter cores, attracting less water into the pellets core. The obtained new insight into the underlying drug release mechanisms can be very helpful during device optimization and improve the safety of this type of advanced drug delivery systems.", 
    "162": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms correlate with the concentration of soluble, although not necessarily monomeric forms of A\u03b2 peptide in the brain parenchyma. The RAGE receptor has been implicated as the protein responsible for active transport of A\u03b2 from blood circulation to the brain. In murine models of AD, inhibition of the A\u03b2:RAGE interaction decreases the levels of A\u03b2 in the brain. Inhibition of the A\u03b2:RAGE interaction would be a promising alternative for the therapy of AD. Rational design of an A\u03b2:RAGE interaction blocker requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the complex. However, the binding domain of RAGE is natively unfolded in physiological conditions, which severely hampers the application of classic methods of protein structure analysis to the design of an antagonist. Here, alternative methods are used to characterize the structural properties of the RAGE-ligand binding domain and to monitor the binding of a series of truncated variants of A\u03b2. Using intrinsic RAGE tryptophan fluorescence and mass spectrometry of non-covalent protein-ligand complexes we have identified shorter versions of A\u03b2 that bind to the RAGE V-domain. We have also shown in cell culture experiments that a selected shortened version of A\u03b2 effectively inhibits full-length A\u03b2, RAGE-mediated, cell uptake. Thus, a truncated version of A\u03b2 capable of blocking its receptor-mediated internalization was established, revealing the binding code and providing the lead compound in the process of drug design.",

The mean half life time (t1/2) of AT-SRPs was almost 2 times longer compared to that of AT-IRPs. The SRPs approximately achieved half of peak drug effect (Emax) of IRPs, while there were no significant differences in the area under effect-time curve from 0 to 24 h after administration (AUEC0-24 h) and the area under effect-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUEC0-\u221e). The value of the rate constant of equilibration between plasma and the effect-site (ke0) for SRPs was about 4 times higher than IRPs. The effect-concentration-time course for AT-SRPs was represented by the clockwise hysteresis loop, while the counter-clockwise hysteresis loop well showed that for AT-IRPs.
