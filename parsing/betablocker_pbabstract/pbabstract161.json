In addition, chronic RSG treatment significantly attenuated HR changes to methylatropine but enhanced HR changes to propranolol. Twelve-week RSG treatment enhanced PE-BRS which was suppressed by methylatropine but not propranolol, and attenuated NP-BRS which was sustained after methylatropine or propranolol. Moreover, 12-week RSG treatment also diminished cardiac responsiveness to isoproterenol and augmented vascular responsiveness to acetylcholine, but not to NP. L-NAME eliminated the differences in MAP and HR between groups, and reversed both RSG-induced enhanced PE-BRS and attenuated NP-BRS.

Propranolol is a known medication used in patients with TOF to prevent and control hypercyanotic spells.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of preoperative use of propranolol on the incidence of postoperative JET after full surgical repair of TOF. A retrospective analysis of 109 patients in whom 57 patients received preoperative propranolol (propranolol group) was compared with 52 patients who did not receive propranolol preoperatively (control group). The incidence of postoperative JET was significantly higher in the control group (38%) than the propranolol group (21%) P=0.042. The propranolol group had significantly less mechanical ventilation time, less ICU stay and less total hospital stay than the control group (P<0.05). Our findings suggest that the preoperative use of propranolol may decrease the incidence of JET after full surgical repair of TOF.

    "30": "Norepinephrine (NE, 10(-5.5) M) exposure for 4 h induces tone augmentation and vasodilation impairment after its removal. These changes are believed to represent early stages of inward remodeling. The hypothesis was tested that adrenoceptors causing vasoconstriction are responsible for NE-induced maintenance of augmented tone and vasodilation impairment, and that other vasoconstrictors associated with in vivo inward remodeling, a condition in which the internal passive diameter of arterioles is reduced without changes in medial cross-sectional area, also induce these changes in isolated arterioles. alpha-Adrenoceptor blockade prevented tone augmentation and vasodilation impairment, while beta-adrenoceptor blockade allowed NE to induce those changes plus inward remodeling. Endothelin-1 (10(-8) M) induced tone augmentation and vasodilation impairment. Angiotensin II (ANG-II, 10(-7) M) and platelet-derived growth factor (10 ng/ml) did not. ANG-II did not cause sustained vasoconstriction, but induced inward remodeling dependent on presence of myogenic tone and tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, prolonged vasoconstriction is not required during ANG-II-induced inward remodeling, suggesting remodeling processes effected by different agonists vary, with tone augmentation and impaired vasodilation occurring when vasoconstriction is required. This stresses the dynamic structure of arterioles, with rapid remodeling possibly involving functional changes and changes in extracellular matrix, cellular attachments, and/or cytoskeletal structures.", 
    "31": "The present study examined the influence of pharmacological modulations of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system on odor recognition in the mouse. Mice exposed to a nonrewarded olfactory stimulation (training) were able to memorize this odor and to discriminate it from a new odor in a recall test performed 15 min later. At longer delays (30 or 60 min), the familiar odor was no longer retained, and both stimuli were perceived as new ones. Following a post-training injection of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist dexefaroxan, the familiar odor was still remembered 30 min after training. In contrast, both the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 and the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 prevented the recognition of the familiar odor 15 min after the first exposure. Noradrenaline release in the olfactory bulb, assessed by measurement of the extracellular noradrenaline metabolite normetanephrine, was increased by 62% following dexefaroxan injection, and was decreased by 38%-44% after treatment with UK 14304 and DSP-4. Performance of mice in the recall test was reduced by a post-training injection of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or the alpha(1)-antagonist prazosin, thus implicating a role for beta- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the facilitating effects of noradrenaline on short-term olfactory recognition in this model.",

In the present study, the effects of the stress peptide, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), on spatial reference memory were assessed following post-training administration. Adult Long-Evans male rats were trained for 6 days on a standard water maze task of reference memory in which animals must learn and remember the fixed location of a hidden, submerged platform. Each day, immediately following three training trials, rats received bilateral infusions of CRH into the lateral ventricles over a range of doses (0.1, 0.33, 1.0, 3.3 microg) or a vehicle solution. Post-training infusions of CRH improved retention as indicated by significantly shorter latencies and path lengths to locate the hidden platform on the first training (retention) trial of days 2 and 3. Additionally, post-training administration of CRH increased spatial bias during probe trials as measured by proximity to the platform location. CRH did not enhance performance on retention or probe trials when administered 2h after daily training indicating that CRH facilitated consolidation specifically. The effects of CRH were attenuated by intraventricular co-administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propanolol, at bilateral doses that had no effect on retention alone (0.1, 1.0 microg). Results indicate that post-training administration of CRH enhanced spatial memory as measured in a water maze, and this effect was mediated, at least partly, by a noradrenergic mechanism.",

    "42": "Beta-blockers are well-established therapeutic agents in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. However, these agents are highly heterogeneous. Beta-blockers differ in their ancillary pharmacologic properties, which are clinically important. Nebivolol is a highly selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor blocker that induces vasodilation through stimulation of the endothelial nitric oxide/L-arginine pathway. As a racemic mixture of d- and l-enantiomers, nebivolol is highly lipophilic and rapidly absorbed. Nebivolol undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism through the cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) system. As a result of genetic polymorphisms, CYP2D6 has variable activity, manifested by extensive and poor metabolizers of nebivolol. Time to maximum concentration is 0.5 to 2 hours, and half-life is 11 hours in extensive metabolizers; these values are about 3 times longer in poor metabolizers. Urinary and fecal excretion of unchanged nebivolol is less than 0.5% of the dose. Nebivolol has a unique hemodynamic profile of reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased left ventricular function. These properties are attributed to its vasodilating action and contrast with the hemodynamic effects of conventional beta-blockers. Nebivolol is thus a novel beta-blocker with several important pharmacologic properties that distinguish it from traditional beta-blockers. These unique properties may confer clinical benefits beyond simple blood pressure lowering.",

Kaplan-Meier 1-year freedom from AT episodes >10 minutes, 1 day, and 7 days was 40%, 73%, and 91% for amiodarone and 28%, 78%, and 86% for class IC AADs (P = nonsignificant).",

    "59": "Anatomical and neurochemical studies indicated that the globus pallidus receives serotonergic innervation from raphe nuclei but the membrane effects of 5-HT on globus pallidus neurons are not entirely clear. We address this question by applying whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on globus pallidus neurons in immature rat brain slices. Under current-clamp recording, 5-HT depolarized globus pallidus neurons and increased their firing rate, an action blocked by both 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists and attributable to an increase in cation conductance(s). Further experiments indicated that 5-HT enhanced the hyperpolarization-activated inward conductance which is blocked by 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist. To determine if 5-HT exerts any presynaptic effects on GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs, the actions of 5-HT on synaptic currents were studied. At 10 microM, 5-HT increased the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) but had no effect on both the frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). However, 5-HT at a higher concentration (50 microM) decreased the frequency but not the amplitude of the mIPSCs, indicating an inhibition of GABA release from the presynaptic terminals. This effect was sensitive to 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist. In addition to the presynaptic effects on GABAergic neurotransmission, 5-HT at 50 microM had no consistent effects on glutamatergic neurotransmission, significantly increased the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in 4 of 11 neurons and decreased the frequency of mEPSCs in 3 of 11 neurons. In conclusion, we found that 5-HT could modulate the excitability of globus pallidus neurons by both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms. In view of the extensive innervation by globus pallidus neurons on other basal ganglia nuclei, this action of 5-HT originated from the raphe may have a profound effect on the operation of the entire basal ganglia network.", 
    "60": "We have previously reported that l-glutamate (L-glu) injected into the ventral portion of medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) of unanesthetized normotensive Wistar rats elicited cardiovascular responses. In the present study we investigated whether the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibit abnormal cardiovascular responses after L-glu microinjection in the vMPFC. Microinjections of L-glu (3, 9, 27, 81 or 150 nmol/200 nl) caused long-lasting dose-related depressor and bradycardiac responses in unanesthetized SHR (n=6, each dose). Pressor and tachycardiac responses were evoked after the injection of 81 nmol of L-glu in the vMPFC of normotensive Wistar rats (n=6). Systemic pretreatment with the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.) had no effect on L-glu cardiovascular responses evoked in the SHR (n=5). However, the treatment with the muscarinic antagonist homatropine methyl bromide (1 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked the bradycardiac response to L-glu, without significant effects on depressor response evoked by L-glu in the SHR (n=5). These results indicate that the bradycardiac response to the injection of L-glu injection in the vMPFC is due to activation of the parasympathetic system and not to inhibition of the cardiac sympathetic input. In conclusion, results indicate opposite cardiovascular responses when L-glu was microinjected in the vMPFC of unanesthetized SHR or normotensive. The bradycardiac response observed in the SHR was due to parasympathetic activation and was not affected by pharmacological blockade of the cardiac sympathetic output.", 
    "61": "A convenient experimental method for thermodynamical studies based on partial-filling affinity CE is presented. The advantages of this approach are the possibility to determine binding energies from relatively weak interactions as well as the small amounts of samples consumed. In order to explore the affinity and selectivity of the cellobiohydrolase Cel7A, a number of propranolol analogues were recently designed. The affinities of a selection of these ligands were determined in the temperature interval 15-40 degrees C, and DeltaG degrees , DeltaH degrees and DeltaS degrees were obtained by means of Van't Hoff plots. Through these experiments, the importance of the entropy contribution in the complexation between the ligands and Cel7A has been demonstrated.", 
    "62": "Apoptosis plays an important role in pathogenesis of primary and secondary cardiomyopathies. It is proposed that antiapoptotic interventions may constitute an effective strategy for these diseases. Some of the antiapoptotic interventions are \"old wine in a new bottle\" measures already included in the conventional pharmacotherapy. As specific antiapoptotic treatment, caspase inhibitors and anti-TNF-alpha antibody are in early phases of clinical trials in non-cardiac diseases or being contemplated for clinical studies. Non-pharmacotherapies such as cardiac resynchronization and left ventricular assist device also exert cardioprotection partly by antiapoptotic mechanisms. In the field of regenerative medicine, myocardial transplantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells has been performed. Although it is controversial whether it is a true regenerative medicine or the cytokine therapy, antiapoptotic effect of transplanted cells may also have a role in cardioprotection. Moreover, apoptosis may develop despite efforts for cardioprotection in some severe situations of heart failure. Cardiac repair and regeneration by cardiac stem cells may compensate a loss of cardiomyocytes avoiding a deleterious situation. Therefore, protection and/or potentiation of such effects by cardiac stem cells appear to be promising therapeutic strategy in the future. In this review, we discuss about the antiapoptotic interventions for cardiomyopathies in the \"real world\" and the future of clinical cardiology.",

The effects of HR on the energetics of myocardium, contractility function, collateral coronary blood circulation, and atherogenesis are considered. A special attention is devoted to specific bradycardic drugs and their mechanisms of action on the electrophysiological processes in the sinus node and on the HR. The new drug ivabradin (a specific selective blocker of the If current) can produce a bradycardic effect and exhibit a pronounced antiischemic action on the myocardium. The creation of such drugs offers an alternative to beta-adrenoblockers and calcium antagonists and opens new possibilities in the pharmacological protection of ischemized myocardium.",

It is marketed in Europe for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure and is currently being reviewed for use in the US by the Food and Drug Administration. Nebivolol appears to be well tolerated with an adverse event profile that is at least similar, if not better, than that of other beta-adrenergic blockers. Studies suggest that long-term therapy with nebivolol improves left ventricular function, exercise capacity, and clinical endpoints of death and cardiovascular hospital admissions in patients with stable heart failure. To date, it is one of the only beta-adrenergic blockers that have been exclusively studied in elderly patients. Additionally, the unique mechanism of action of nebivolol makes it a promising agent for treatment of chronic heart failure in high-risk patient populations, such as African Americans.

Adults with hypertension treated with diuretic or beta-blocker monotherapy between 1998 and 2001 were identified from a large US electronic medical records database of primary care practices. Patients were required to have a baseline blood pressure (BP) > or =140/90 mmHg (> or =130/80 mmHg for diabetes mellitus) and recorded BP measurements within 6 months before and 1-12 months following index date. Patients were matched 1:1:1 by propensity score to correct for differences in baseline characteristics. 1875 patients met study criteria and 660 (220 in each cohort) were matched based on propensity scores. Matched cohorts had no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Mean changes in systolic/diastolic BP were -17.5/-8.8, -15.7/-6.3, and -13.0/-8.0 mmHg with DHPs, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs, respectively. Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High BP 6/7 goal attainment for each regimen was 47.3%, 40.0%, and 32.2%, respectively.

However, regimen complexity has been associated with reduced patient compliance. Treatment with a fixed combination may, therefore, increase compliance as a result of simplifying the dosage regimen. Bimatoprost/timolol fixed combination (BTFC) combines two clinically effective agents that decrease elevated intraocular pressure by independent mechanisms. In two clinical studies, BTFC was more effective than its individual components. Furthermore, in a non-inferiority study BTFC has been shown to be as effective as the association of its individual components.

    "79": "Hypertension is a multifactorial disorder leading to pathophysiologic changes in target organs over time through diverse mechanisms. In addition, hypertension frequently resists control with monotherapy, necessitating combination therapy with two or more antihypertensive agents. Many currently available fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations combine drugs with different, but complementary, mechanisms of action to improve overall efficacy and tolerability. In addition, it is possible to select drug combinations whereby one drug offsets the negative effects of the other drug. Fixed-dose antihypertensive combinations may provide significant advantages over high-dose monotherapy, such as improved BP-lowering efficacy, reduced adverse event frequency, improved patient compliance, potentially lower treatment costs, and shorter time to BP control. Combination therapy has been recommended as potential first-line therapy in recent consensus guideline statements, especially for higher-risk patients, such as those with stage 2 hypertension. The combination of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system-targeting agent, such as an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB), and a diuretic or calcium channel antagonist appears to provide synergy with regard to BP lowering. In addition, ACE inhibitors and ARBs have demonstrated beneficial effects beyond BP reduction, reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, inhibiting development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the progression of renal disease. Preliminary studies of fixed-dose combinations have shown reductions in left ventricular hypertrophy and improvements in markers of renal function. Additional studies currently underway will compare the effects of available fixed-dose combinations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and markers of renal dysfunction.",

    "97": "Gastroesophageal varices are a direct consequence of portal hypertension. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers decrease portal pressure and are effective in preventing variceal hemorrhage. However, a large multicenter placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are not effective in preventing the development of varices and are associated with a significant rate of adverse events. This therapy is, therefore, not recommended in compensated cirrhotic patients without varices at large. In this very compensated group of patients with cirrhosis (stage 1, ie, without varices and without ascites or encephalopathy) the predictive value (both for the development of varices and for the development of clinical decompensation) of a baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 10 mm Hg is confirmed, supporting this threshold level as one that defines a clinically significant portal hypertension. Importantly, reductions in hepatic venous pressure gradient >10% are associated with a significant reduction in the development of varices, a therapeutic goal that could be achieved through the use of beta-blockers or other drugs being developed for the treatment of portal hypertension.", 
    "98": "Previous studies, exploring the effect of blood viscosity on portal pressure in portal hypertensive humans and animal models, have shown conflicting results. In a series of studies, in portal vein constricted rats, we investigated effects of reduced blood viscosity on the hyperdynamic circulation, portal pressure, and vascular geometry. Blood was withdrawn at a rate of 0.3 mL/min for 15 minutes followed by 15 minutes of stabilization. The shed blood or Haemaccel was infused at the same rate and volume as used for withdrawal. Hemodynamic measurements were performed using radioactive microspheres. Blood viscosity was measured with an Ostwald viscometer. Vascular hindrance (reflecting vessel geometry) was calculated as resistance/viscosity ratio. In normal and portal hypertensive rats, acute volume replacement with Haemaccel, induced increase in systemic and splanchnic blood flows reflecting mainly changes in viscosity and not in blood vessel geometry. However, 24 hours later, in Haemaccel treated animals, an increased splanchnic arteriolar and porto-collateral vascular hindrance were observed. This indicated vasoconstriction in the porto-collateral vascular bed. The increase in portal venous inflow after acute volume restitution with Haemaccel was prevented by pretreatment with propranolol. Although, caution should be taken in extrapolating these results to humans, we would like to speculate that during a portal hypertensive-related bleeding episode: (1) volume replacement with low viscosity plasma expanders may aggravate the hyperdynamic circulation of portal hypertension. (2) Slow rate volume replacement enables hemodynamic adaptation to occur. (3) Volume replacement maybe more safe in a subject pretreated with propranolol.", 
    "99": "beta-Blockers are widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and act by antagonizing the effects of adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) on beta-adrenergic receptors. All beta-blockers currently used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease contain at least one chiral center and, while most are marketed as racemates, their cardiac antihypertensive activity generally resides in the S-enantiomer. Nebivolol is a third generation beta-blocker that is highly selective for the beta(1)-adrenoceptor. The nebivolol molecule contains four chiral centers and is marketed as a racemate of (+)-nebivolol (SRRR-configuration) and (-)-nebivolol (RSSS-configuration). Nebivolol differs from all other beta-blockers with a hydroxypropanolamine substructure in that its cardiac antihypertensive activity resides in the R-enantiomer at the hydroxy group, whereas all other beta-blockers have antihypertensive activity in the S-enantiomer. Two of the four chiral centers in nebivolol are part of a ring structure and the increased rigidity of this structure may be related to nebivolol's divergence from the standard pharmacophore model of beta-blockers.",

Aspirin and nitroglycerin spray relieved his pain. Although he remained pain free, tachycardia persisted despite 15 mg of diazepam intravenously. Nearly two hours after presentation, a total of 5 mg of metoprolol was given for persistent tachycardia (115/minute) and an elevated troponin.

In humans given smaller doses of cocaine, beta adrenergic receptor antagonists exacerbate coronary vasoconstriction. Both effects are presumed to occur through unopposed alpha adrenergic receptor agonism. Despite these data, actual cases describing adverse effects in cocaine users given beta adrenergic receptor antagonists are uncommon. This case supports the potential lethality of a cocaine-beta adrenergic receptor antagonist interaction.",

    "107": "Beta-blockers have long being used as first-line therapy for hypertension as their use had resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in controlled clinical trials. A recent meta-analysis comparing beta-blockers to all other anti-hypertensive drugs taken together has found that stroke reduction was sub-optimal. Specifically, atenolol was associated with a 26% higher risk of stroke compared with other drugs. Several reasons may explain the less favourable outcomes with beta-blocker therapy. These include some adverse metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidaemia and new-onset diabetes, and less effective reduction of central aortic compared with brachial blood pressure. Newer beta-blockers such as carvedilol or nebivolol are better tolerated. These beta-blockers have a vasodilating effect, which may beneficially affect systolic blood pressure in the aorta. Their long-term cardiovascular outcome in hypertension is still not known. Further studies would be required to show that stroke is adequately reduced by these newer beta-blockers. In conclusion, beta-blockers should not be the first drugs of choice in the management of uncomplicated hypertension. They may be used in addition to other antihypertensive agents to achieve blood pressure goals. However, in patients with angina pectoris, a previous myocardial infarction, heart failure and certain dysrhythmias, beta-blockers still play an important role.", 
    "108": "This contribution is an overview on the role of noradrenaline as neurotransmitter and stress hormone in emotional memory processing. The role of stress hormones in memory formation of healthy subjects can bear significance for the derailment of memory processes, for example, in post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Increased noradrenaline levels lead to better memory performance, whereas blocking the noradrenergic receptors with a betablocker attenuates this enhanced memory for emotional information. Noradrenaline appears to interact with cortisol in emotional memory processes, varying from encoding to consolidation and retrieval. Imaging studies show that confronting human subjects with emotional stimuli results in increased amygdala activation and that this activation is noradrenergic dependent. The role of noradrenaline in other brain areas, such as hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, is shortly summarized. Finally, the pros and cons of a therapeutic application of betablockers in the (secondary) prevention of PTSD will be discussed.",

Another hallmark of elderly patients is the increasing prevalence of multiple coexisting chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes that may complicate the clinical presentation and evolution of HF. Although diagnosis may be challenging, because atypical symptoms and presentations are common, and comorbid conditions may mimic or complicate the clinical picture, diagnostic criteria do not change in elderly people. Drug treatment is not significantly different from that recommended in younger patients, and largely remains empiric, because clinical trials have generally excluded elderly people and patients with comorbid conditions. Disease management programmes may have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality for patients with HF.", 
    "112": "Heart failure is the commonest reason for hospitalisation and readmission among older adults. HF shows peculiar features in elderly people, and is usually complicated by comorbidities, presenting a significant financial burden worldwide, nevertheless elderly people have been generally excluded from clinical trials, and thus management largely remains empiric and based on evidence from younger age groups.", 
    "113": "Atrial fibrillation (AFb) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. Once initiated, AFb alters atrial electrical and structural properties (remodeling) that promotes its maintenance and recurrence. Treatment is directed to restore and maintain the sinus rhythm, to control the ventricular rate and to prevent thromboembolic complications. Recent evidence indicates that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonists and statins modify atrial remodeling and reduce the incidence of AFb, thus possibly representing a new alternative in the treatment of the arrhythmia.", 
    "114": "Intervention studies indicate that beta blockers as well as diuretics have unfavourable effects on lipid metabolism and lead to new onsets of diabetes mellitus more frequently than ACE inhibitors, AT1 antagonists and calcium antagonists. Moreover, a meta-analysis showed an elevated risk for strokes in hypertensive patients treated with beta blockers. Until the conclusion of other controlled studies, beta blockers will nevertheless retain their important role in the treatment of hypertensive patients with coronary heart disease or heart failure. They should continue to be one of the preferred antihypertensives.", 
    "115": "Heart rate variability (HRV) and heart rate turbulence are known to be disturbed and associated with excess mortality in heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate whether losartan, when added on top of beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy, could improve these indices in patients with systolic heart failure.",

The HRV and heart rate turbulence indices were calculated from 24-hour Holter recordings both at the beginning and at the end of follow-up. The baseline clinical characteristics, HRV, and heart rate turbulence indices were similar in the 2 groups. At 12 weeks of follow-up, all HRV parameters except pNN50 increased (SDNN: 113.2 +/- 34.2 versus 127.8 +/- 24.1, P = .001; SDANN: 101.5 +/- 31.7 versus 115.2 +/- 22.0, P = .001; triangular index: 29.9 +/- 11.1 versus 34.2 +/- 7.9, P = .008; RMSSD: 29.1 +/- 20.2 versus 34.3 +/- 23.0, P = .009; NN50: 5015.3 +/- 5554.9 versus 6446.7 +/- 6101.1, P = .024; NN50: 5.65 +/- 6.41 versus 7.24 +/- 6.99, P = .089; SDNNi: 45.1 +/- 13.3 versus 50.3 +/- 14.5, P = .004), turbulence onset decreased (-0. 61 +/- 1.70 versus -1.24 +/- 1.31, P = .003) and turbulence slope increased (4.107 +/- 3.881 versus 5.940 +/- 4.281, P = .004) significantly in the losartan group as compared with controls.",

Echocardiographic parameters were not different, and brain natriuretic peptide was only minimally increased. Norepinephrine, inflammatory markers, cardiac troponin T, and creatinine values were significantly higher. After adjustment, COPD no longer predicted all-cause mortality but remained predictive of noncardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 2.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.58-3.96; P < .0001) and hospitalizations, especially noncardiovascular (hazard ratio 1.71; 95% confidence interval; 1.43-2.06; P < .0001).", 
    "121": "Patients with COPD are more symptomatic and have worse outcomes that are not explained by poorer left ventricular function. After adjustment for demographic, clinical, biohumoral, and treatment variables, COPD is a weak predictor of all-cause mortality but a strong predictor of noncardiovascular events. Awareness and optimized treatment of heart failure and COPD may reduce the clinical burden of these patients.",

Among those receiving antihypertensive treatment, 59% had blood pressure greater than 130/80mmHg. Overall, 42% received a hypolipidaemic treatment: statin, 25%; fibrate, 18%. About half the people with a high cardiovascular risk had LDL cholesterol greater than 1g/L, but only 32% were given a statin. Among people with an abnormal albumin/creatinine ratio (11%), 59% received an ACE inhibitor/ARB. Among those with CHD, 35% received the two treatments recommended in 1999 (beta-blockers and antiplatelet agents); in multivariate analyses, this two-treatment delivery was positively associated with male gender, self-reported hypertension and consulting a cardiologist.",

    "131": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic effects obtained by gastroretentive dosage form (GRDF) for drugs absorbed by passive paracellular diffusion (atenolol, acyclovir) or active transport (valacyclovir). Model drugs were delivered as gastric infusion (GInf) through an implanted catheter (resembling GRDF), intravenous, oral (PO), and colonic administration to rats. For atenolol (highly soluble drug), GInf resulted in a prolonged Tmax and reduced Cmax in comparison to PO, whereas bioavailability was similar. Bioavailability after colonic bolus was significantly lower. Results were also simulated by a pharmacokinetic model. For acyclovir, GInf and PO demonstrated almost the same pharmacokinetic profile with low bioavailability, most probably due to the solubility-limited absorption. Valacyclovir demonstrated the significant change in the shape of pharmacokinetic profile as a function of the rate of gastric delivery, without variation in bioavailability. Valacyclovir was not absorbed from colon. Experimental and theoretical methodologies to assess the pharmacokinetic influences of GRDF mode of administration were developed, avoiding the need to compound the drug in a dosage form. GRDF provides a mean for controlled release of compounds that are absorbed by active transport in the upper intestine. It also enables controlled delivery for paracellularly absorbed drugs without a decrease in bioavailability.",

In patients with diabetes, increased ADMA levels have been reported, which may be associated with endothelial dysfunction.

From Austrian sickness funds claims, we identified all acute MI patients who were discharged within 30 days and who survived >or=120 days after MI in 2004. We ascertained outpatient use of ACEI/ARBs, BBs, statins, and aspirin from all filled prescriptions between discharge and 120 days post MI. Comorbidities were ascertained from use of indicator drugs during the preceding year. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent determinants of study drug use. We evaluated 4,105 MI patients, whose mean age was 68.8 (+/-13.2) years; 59.5% were men. Within 120 days after MI, 67% filled prescriptions for ACE/ARBs, 74% for BBs, and 67% for statin. While 41% received all these classes and 34% two, 25% of patients received only one or none of these drugs. Older age and presence of severe mental illness were associated with lower use of all drug classes. Diabetics had greater ACEI/ARB use. Fewer BBs were used in patients with obstructive lung disease. Statin use was lower in patients using treatment for congestive heart failure (all P<0.001). We conclude that recommended medications were underused in Austrian MI survivors. Quality indicators should be established and interventions be implemented to ensure maximum secondary prevention after MI.", 
    "137": "Presynaptic inhibitory or facilitatory autoreceptors are targets for the endogenous neurotransmitter of the respective neuron, and also for exogenous agonists, partial agonists and antagonists which can produce pharmacological actions through changes in transmitter release. In addition, presynaptic inhibitory or facilitatory heteroreceptors can also be acted upon by exogenous agonists, partial agonists or antagonists to induce changes in transmitter release with useful therapeutic effects. This article summarizes drugs that are known or likely to produce their therapeutic effects through presynaptic modulation of neurotransmitter release. Included are drugs acting on alpha and beta adrenoceptors, dopamine receptors, angiotensin, opioid, cannabinoid, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Also discussed are changes in presynaptic receptor mechanisms produced by drugs that inhibit transmitter re-uptake.", 
    "138": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with enhanced synchronization of neuronal network activity in the beta (15-30 Hz) frequency band across several nuclei of the basal ganglia (BG). Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) appears to reduce this pathological oscillation, thereby alleviating PD symptoms. However, direct stimulation of primary motor cortex (M1) has recently been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in PD, suggesting a role for cortex in patterning pathological rhythms. Here, we examine the properties of M1 network oscillations in coronal slices taken from rat brain. Oscillations in the high beta frequency range (layer 5, 27.8+/-1.1 Hz, n=6) were elicited by co-application of the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid (400 nM) and muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (50 microM). Dual extracellular recordings, local application of tetrodotoxin and recordings in M1 micro-sections indicate that the activity originates within deep layers V/VI. Beta oscillations were unaffected by specific AMPA receptor blockade, abolished by the GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)R) antagonist picrotoxin and the gap-junction blocker carbenoxolone, and modulated by pentobarbital and zolpidem indicating dependence on networks of GABAergic interneurons and electrical coupling. High frequency stimulation (HFS) at 125 Hz in superficial layers, designed to mimic transdural/transcranial stimulation, generated gamma oscillations in layers II and V (incidence 95%, 69.2+/-7.3 Hz, n=17) with very fast oscillatory components (VFO; 100-250 Hz). Stimulation at 4 Hz, however, preferentially promoted theta activity (incidence 62.5%, 5.1+/-0.6 Hz, n=15) that effected strong amplitude modulation of ongoing beta activity. Stimulation at 20 Hz evoked mixed theta and gamma responses. These data suggest that within M1, evoked theta, gamma and fast oscillations may coexist with and in some cases modulate pharmacologically induced beta oscillations.",

Four groups of general surgery residents (PGY I-V), each led by 1 chief resident, were assigned a quality parameter, performed an evidence-based current literature review, and formulated a standardized management approach based on the level of evidence and recommendations available. Because preoperative preparation includes anesthetic care and operating room preparation, we presented our findings at the Department of Surgery Grand Rounds in a multidisciplinary format that included presentations by each resident group, the Department of Anesthesia, the Department of Medicine, and the Department of Nursing. The aim of the multidisciplinary quality assurance conference was to present the evidence-based literature findings in order to determine how standardization of preoperative care would alter anesthetic and nursing care, and to obtain feedback about management protocols. To determine the educational impact of this model of integrated systems-based practice quality assessment on the teaching experience, residents were queried regarding the value of this educational venue and responses were rated on a Likert scale.", 
    "141": "Resident participation was excellent. The residents garnered valuable information by performing a literature review and evaluating the best preoperative preparation given each parameter. Furthermore, integration of their findings into systems-based practice including anesthesia and nursing care provided an appreciation of the complexities of care as well as the associated need for appropriate medical knowledge, communication, and professionalism. The derivation of treatment protocols included an opportunity to incorporate several competencies across multiple disciplines. The residents evaluated 5 questions and deemed the educational exercise an effective model to enrich surgical resident education while simultaneously improving patient care. The residents also strongly agreed that they would participate in similar projects in the future as well as recommend this educational exercise to other residents. A finalized preoperative order set was created and distributed to all residents for use in the preoperative care of general surgery patients.",

A significant decrease in mean arterial pressure occurred in the low EF group, but the decrease was within 30% of baseline. In the normal EF group, there was no decrease in cardiac index, but a significant increase in stroke index, in addition to an increase in stroke volume. In the low EF group, cardiac index significantly decreased along with the decrease in HR, but there was no increase in end-diastolic volume or stroke volume.", 
    "150": "Administration of landiolol using the presently recommended dosage and administration route causes a decrease in HR without aggravation of hemodynamics in patients with normal cardiac function, but in patients with preoperative EF lower than 50%, it may lead to further deterioration of cardiac function due to a decrease in HR.",

Existing comparisons indicate similar or possible greater efficacy of beta blockade than ACE inhibition. As beta blockade is well tolerated, it could be considered in individual stable patients. However, early combined treatment with both neurohormonal antagonists remains preferable to either neurohormonal antagonist alone and should not be delayed.",

At no other time in the human life cycle is the human being at more risk of unexplained and unexpected death than during the prenatal period. The risk of sudden death from 20-40 weeks gestation is 6-12 deaths/1000 fetuses/year. This is equal to, and in some ethnic groups HIGHER than, the risk of death in the adult population with known coronary artery disease over the same time frame (6-12 deaths/1000 patients/year). Because only a small percentage of the United States population is pregnant each year, because fetal demise is not often acknowledged through public displays such as funerals, and finally because fetal death is culturally accepted to a much greater extent than it should be, this critically important area of women's healthcare has not had the technological advances that have been seen in adult cardiac intensive care and other areas of medicine. Fetal cardiac deaths may be preventable and the diseases that lead to these deaths are often treatable, especially if the sophistication of our modern ICU's could somehow be translated to the prenatal monitoring arena. This review article will outline recent advances in evaluating fetal electrophysiology, helping the perinatologist to better understand the nuances of fetal arrhythmias.",

She was successfully resuscitated with extracorporeal life support. Therapeutic plasma exchange was initiated. Extracorporeal support was discontinued 70 hours later. The patient made a full recovery. Simultaneous verapamil and propranolol overdoses can cause severe hemodynamic compromise and arrest of electrical and mechanical function of the heart. Emergency extracorporeal life support can successfully maintain vital organ blood flow and allows time for drug metabolism, redistribution, and removal. Therapeutic plasma exchange may reduce the time of emergency extracorporeal life support.

Agents targeting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems have shown cardiovascular and survival benefits in clinical trials. Beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors remain the mainstream initial therapy. The benefits of aldosterone antagonists have been demonstrated in advanced heart failure (spironolactone) and after myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure (eplerenone). Emerging clinical evidence demonstrated that angiotensin receptor blockers may be a reasonable alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients with heart failure (candesartan) and following myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction (valsartan). Angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan) also provided incremental benefits when added to ACE inhibitors in chronic heart failure. Thus, combining neuroendocrine inhibitors in heart failure appears both biologically plausible and evidence-based. However, this approach raised concerns about side effects, such as hypotension, renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, and others. Close follow-up and implementation of evidence-based medicine (ie, using agents and doses proven beneficial in clinical trials) should therefore be undertaken when combining neuroendocrine inhibitors.",

Analogous results were obtained left ventricular mass index. After 6 months it was reduced to 94+/-12 g/m(2) in woman and in men to 132+/-32 g/m(2).", 
    "171": "1. In differentiated thyroid cancer patients, treated postoperatively with L-thyroxine suppressive therapy, left ventricular hypertrophy is observed already during the first year of suppressive therapy and progresses during the next year of treatment. 2 Addition of a beta-adrenergic antagonist to suppressive doses of L-thyroxine causes a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, thus, beta-adrenergic antagonists should be administered in this group of patients.", 
    "172": "We enrolled 347 hypertensive patients, randomly allocated them to different first-line treatments, and followed-up for 24 months. Persistence on treatment was significantly higher in patients treated with ARBs (68.5%) and ACE inhibitors (64.5%) vs. CCBs (51.6%), beta-blockers (44.8%), and diuretics (34.4%). No ARB, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, or diuretic was associated with a greater persistence in therapy as compared with the other molecules used in each therapeutic class. The rate of persistence was significantly higher in patients treated with lercanidipine vs. other CCBs (59.3% vs. 46.6%). Systolic and diastolic BP decreased more in patients treated with ARBs (-11.2/-5.8 mmHg), ACE inhibitors (-10.5/-5.1 mmHg), and CCBs (-8.5/-4.6 mmHg) when compared to beta-blockers (-4.0/-2.3 mmHg) and diuretics (-2.3/-2.1 mmHg).", 
    "173": "The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study showed that losartan-based treatment reduced risk of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke and myocardial infarction compared with atenolol-based treatment in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy with similar office blood pressure (BP) reduction. Our aim was to investigate the effect of losartan- and atenolol-based treatment on 24-h ambulatory BP and heart rate (HR) in LIFE.", 
    "174": "In 110 patients, 24-h ambulatory BP and heart rate were recorded at baseline and 1 year after randomization.", 
    "175": "Ambulatory BP was comparably reduced throughout the 24-h period after 1 year of losartan- vs atenolol-based antihypertensive treatment. Office and ambulatory BP were comparably reduced in the follow-up period. Early morning surge in BP was similar between groups. Non-dipping status was more frequent in the losartan group (p = 0.01). From baseline to Year 1 the 24-h HR profile for the losartan group was unchanged, but, as expected, there was a significant decrease in daytime HR in the atenolol group, which was not as large during early night-time.", 
    "176": "There were no differences in 24-h BP burden and HR that could explain the difference in outcome in favor of losartan vs atenolol in the LIFE study.", 
    "177": "Timolol maleate-loaded chitosan (CS) nanoparticles were prepared by desolvation method. Experimental variables such as molecular weight of CS and amount of crosslinking agent were varied to study their effect on drug entrapment efficiency, size and release rates of nanoparticles. Chemical stability of timolol maleate (TM) and crosslinking of CS were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetric studies were performed on drug-loaded nanoparticles to investigate crystalline nature of the drug after entrapment. Results indicated amorphous dispersion of drug in the polymer matrix. Scanning electron microscopy revealed irregularly shaped particles. Mean particle size of nanoparticles ranged between 118 and 203 nm, while zeta potential ranged between +17 and +22 mV. Entrapment efficiency of nanoparticles ranged between 47.6 and 63.0%. In-vitro release studies were performed in phosphate buffer saline of pH 7.4. A slow release of TM up to 24 h was observed. A 3(2) full factorial design was employed and second-order regression models were used to study the response (% drug release at 4 h). Release data as analyzed by an empirical relationship suggested that drug release deviated from the Fickian trend.", 
    "178": "The main aim of pharmacotherapeutics, is the attainment of an effective drug concentration at the intended site of action for a sufficient period of time to elicit the response. In this study a trial was made to formulate atenolol, which is a beta-adrenergic blocker in a topical ophthalmic gel. Two polymers were used in this study, carboxymethylcellulose and sodium alginate in different concentrations. Atenolol was used in concentrations 0.5, 1, and 1.5% w/v. The in vitro release study was carried out. The results showed that the release rate of atenolol from gel preparations decreased as an inverse function of polymer concentration, while the release rate of the drug increased as the initial concentration increased. The data of drug release from the two polymers in different concentrations was plotted against the square root of time, and the diffusion coefficients (D), were calculated from the slope of the equation. Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) measurements of the rabbit's eye treated with 1% w/v atenolol solution, and 1% w/v atenolol in two gel formulations with different concentrations of the polymer were determined. The two gel formulations showed that these polymers extended the duration of pressure reducing effect to 8 hr, when compared with atenolol solution. Area above the curve (AAC), maximum response, maximum time of response (t(max)), and the duration of action were calculated. The overall results of this study indicated that the gel formulations of atenolol could be used for the development of a long-acting ophthalmic formulation.", 
    "179": "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia is a disease which is relatively rarely found and sometimes difficult to treat. Up to now it has been mostly treated with a beta-blocker or verapamil. If this did not work sinus node modulation was considered. Since the relatively new selective IF-stream blocker ivabradine has been approved for the therapy of chronic stable angina pectoris, a new therapeutic option is available. As ivabradine is well tolerated and only few side effects are known, it may become a new therapeutic step between medication and the invasive sinus node modulation. We report the case of a young female patient with inappropriate sinus tachycardia where a sustained therapeutic success was achieved with ivabradine medication as an alternative therapeutic trial after various ineffective medications.", 
    "180": "Atenolol {or 4-[2-hydroxy-3-(isopropylamino)propoxy]phenylacetamide} crystallizes with 4-aminobenzoic acid to give the salt {3-[4-(aminocarbonylmethyl)phenoxy]-2-hydroxypropyl}isopropylammonium 4-aminobenzoate monohydrate, C14H23N2O3(+) x C7H6NO2(-) x H2O. In the crystal structure, the water molecule, the carboxylate group of 4-aminobenzoate, and the hydroxy and ether O atoms of atenolol form a supramolecular R3(3) (11) heterosynthon. Three other types of supramolecular synthons link the asymmetric unit into a two-dimensional structure.",

    "182": "Cross-sectional analysis of publicly available data of 18 process and intermediate outcome measures for people with coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes and stroke.", 
    "183": "Populations registered with 912 general practices in Scotland grouped into three categories by level of remoteness from urban settlements: not remote, remote and very remote.", 
    "184": "Mean percentages achieving quality indicators and interquartile range scores.", 
    "185": "Remote and very remote practices were more likely to have characteristics associated with low Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) total points score (smaller, higher capitation income, dispensing practice, and had lower statin prescribing despite higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes). However, in contrast with previous research, there was little evidence that quality of care was lower in more remote areas for the 18 process and intermediate outcome measures examined. The exception was significantly lower cholesterol measurement and control in people with CHD, diabetes and stroke attending very remote practices (p<0.01) and beta-blocker prescription in CHD (p = 0.01).", 
    "186": "Under QOF, there are few differences in the quality of care delivered to patients in practices with different degrees of remoteness. The differences in achievement for cholesterol were consistent with lower rates of statin prescribing relative to disease burden in very remote practices. No differences were found for complex process measures such as retinopathy screening, implying that differences under QOF are more likely to be due to slower adoption of evidence-based practice than access problems. Examining this will require analysis of individual patient data.", 
    "187": "We sought an isolated vascular preparation and experimental setting where the function of alpha2B-adrenoceptors could be demonstrated by non-recombinant technique. ST-91 (2-[2,6-diethylphenylamino]-2-imidazoline), an alpha 2B-adrenoceptor agonist with a mixed alpha adrenergic receptor type/subtype selection profile antagonized the relaxant effect of isoproterenol in endothelium-denuded rat mesenteric artery rings precontracted with phenylephrine. At 10(-7) M of ST-91, the antagonism was characterized by a rightward shift of isoproterenol dose-response curve (A50=6.81+/-1.40 e-7 (n=4) vs the control 1.29+/-0.25 e-7 M (n=4)) with no E(max) depression. At 10(-6) M the Emax depression was prevalent (36.1+/-7.0% (n=4) vs the control 79.9+/-5.1% (n=4)); both actions could be antagonized by the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine. The not subtype-selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine (10(-7) M) did not affect the relaxant action of isoproterenol. Present findings are discussed in the light of previously reported hemodynamic effects attributed to alpha2B-adrenoceptors in receptor subtype-knockout animals.", 
    "188": "To assess in a daily practice survey one-year survival in a cohort of patients with heart failure (HF) according to their clinical profiles and the way they were managed by cardiologists.", 
    "189": "A prospective observational survey was conducted in 1941 patients with HF followed up for one year. Results show high rates of prescription for ACE inhibitors, indicating that cardiologists take into account international recommendations. ACE inhibitors are prescribed at dosage levels approaching those recommended by the guidelines. However, beta-blocker prescription still shows a significant deficit and the prescribed doses are much lower than those currently recommended. The multifactorial modeling analysis showed that global heart failure (P=0.004), advanced NYHA class (P<0.001), renal failure (P<0.001) were predictive of poor outcome whereas an increased survival likelihood was observed in patients given ACE-inhibitor/beta-blocker combination compared with beta-blocker alone or ACE-inhibitor alone.", 
    "190": "The results from this study should enhance the prescription of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers at effective doses in compliance with the guidelines. They also suggest that a synergic positive effect of the combination of these two therapeutic classes is observed in real life situations.", 
    "191": "To assess effects of antiglaucoma drugs on refractive outcomes in eyes with myopic regression after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).", 
    "192": "Prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial.", 
    "193": "We examined 27 eyes with mean myopic regression +/- standard deviation of -1.26 +/- 0.48 diopters (D; range, -0.50 to -2.25 D) after LASIK. Nipradilol 2.5% was administered topically twice daily to these regressive eyes. We obtained the refraction (spherical equivalent, astigmatism), intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, pachymetry, geometry, and refractive power of the cornea before and three months after treatment.", 
    "194": "Mean manifest refraction was improved significantly from -1.02 +/- 0.52 D to -0.44 +/- 0.39 D (P < .001). However, mean manifest astigmatism was changed from -0.55 +/- 0.30 D to -0.49 +/- 0.22 D, but the difference was not significant (P = .23). The IOP was decreased significantly from 11.4 +/- 2.4 mm Hg to 9.4 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P < .001). Central corneal thickness was not changed significantly from 505.2 +/- 39.3 microm to 503.6 +/- 38.7 microm (P = .61). The posterior corneal surface was shifted posteriorly by 9.1 +/- 8.2 microm, and the total refractive power of the cornea was decreased significantly, by 0.63 +/- 0.62 D (P < .001), at three months after application.", 
    "195": "The preliminary data show that antiglaucoma drugs are effective for the reduction of the refractive regression, especially of the spherical errors, after LASIK. It is suggested that backward movement of the cornea may occur, possibly flattening the corneal curvature by lowering the IOP. Reduction of the IOP may contribute to improving regression after keratorefractive surgery."
