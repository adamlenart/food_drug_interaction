On the basis of these studies, it has been advocated that in vitro covalent binding to liver microsomal proteins in the presence and the absence of NADPH be used routinely to screen drug candidates. However, the utility of this approach in predicting toxicities of drug candidates accurately remains an unanswered question. Importantly, the years of research that have been invested in understanding metabolic bioactivation and covalent binding and its potential role in toxicity have focused only on those compounds that demonstrate toxicity. Investigations have not frequently queried whether in vitro covalent binding could be observed with drugs with good safety records. Eighteen drugs (nine hepatotoxins and nine nonhepatotoxins in humans) were assessed for in vitro covalent binding in NADPH-supplemented human liver microsomes. Of the two sets of nine drugs, seven in each set were shown to undergo some degree of covalent binding. Among hepatotoxic drugs, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, indomethacin, nefazodone, sudoxicam, and tienilic acid demonstrated covalent binding, while benoxaprofen and felbamate did not. Of the nonhepatotoxic drugs evaluated, buspirone, diphenhydramine, meloxicam, paroxetine, propranolol, raloxifene, and simvastatin demonstrated covalent binding, while ibuprofen and theophylline did not. A quantitative comparison of covalent binding in vitro intrinsic clearance did not separate the two groups of compounds, and in fact, paroxetine, a nonhepatotoxin, showed the greatest amount of covalent binding in microsomes. Including factors such as the fraction of total metabolism comprised by covalent binding and the total daily dose of each drug improved the discrimination between hepatotoxic and nontoxic drugs based on in vitro covalent binding data; however, the approach still would falsely identify some agents as potentially hepatotoxic.",

Sotalol was partially effective for AVRT, however, it did not prevent AF, RF ablation cured all arrythmias. This case shows that sotalol can attenuate AVRT recurrences, however, it does not prevent rapid conduction via accessory pathways during AF.",

The levels of p22(phox) protein in RPTEC were measured using Western blotting after albumin treatment with ARBs. Angiotensin II concentrations in cell media and cell lysates were assayed with a commercially available kit.", 
    "4": "Human albumin (0.1-10 mg/ml) dose-dependently increased NAG release and olmesartan or valsartan (10(-9)-10(-7) mol/l) showed a significant reduction on albumin (1 mg/ml)-induced NAG release in RPTEC. Albumin treatment (1 mg/ml) showed significant increases in p22(phox) protein levels in RPTEC and ARBs significantly decreased albumin-induced p22(phox) protein levels. Significant increases in 8-OHdG levels were observed in the albumin (1 mg/ml)-treated group and ARBs markedly reduced albumin-induced 8-OHdG levels in RPTEC. Human albumin dose-dependently increased angiotensin II concentrations in both cell media and lysates.",

    "6": "Self-injuring behavior (SIB) is a life-threatening behavior exhibited by many species, including humans, and has no known cause and no agreed upon treatment. The role of the stress axis in the maintenance of this mysterious behavior was examined in subjects with life-long SIB. Over a 6-year period, 40 hr of direct observations of behavior and the environment were recorded on palmtop computers while 36 residential subjects (28 target and 8 control subjects) conducted their daily activities. Blood samples were collected in morning and evening for all subjects and within minutes after a self-injuring act in 28 target subjects who exhibited SIB to determine levels of ACTH and B-endorphin (BE). Self-injuring events in the patient group were significantly sequentially dependent (i.e., the only predictor of a self-injuring act was an antecedent self-injuring act). Higher morning levels of BE relative to ACTH predicted [r(df=27) = .57, p < .001] the sequentially dependent pattern of SIB. This effect was validated in a subgroup retested several months later [r(df=22) = .60, p < .001]. A subgroup of seven subjects exhibiting sequentially dependent patterns were administered an opiate blocker (naltrexone) in a double-blind, crossover design with an additional 14 hr/week of observation for 7 weeks. Naltrexone challenge interrupted the sequential pattern (improved behavior) in subjects with elevated BE immediately following SIB (r = .85, p < .01). The pattern of results supported the conclusion that the stress axis played a significant role in the maintenance of complex episodes of self-injury.",

    "9": "In bovine corneal epithelial and endothelial cells, immunocytochemistry and Western blot were positive for alpha(1)-, alpha(2A)-, beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of corneal epithelial and endothelial beta-adrenoceptors with isoprenaline led to a dose-dependent increase in cAMP concentration and activation of PKA. Stimulation of corneal alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors with brimonidine resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cAMP concentration and the inhibition of PKA activity.", 
    "10": "In corneal epithelial and endothelial cells, beta-adrenergic stimulation leads to activation of PKA via stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, and alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor stimulation inhibits PKA activity via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Stimulation and inhibition of the corneal cAMP-PKA pathway may play a role in important corneal functions such as wound healing or homeostasis. Long-term therapy with alpha(2A)-agonists or beta-antagonists may influence these functions in a currently unknown way.", 
    "11": "Studies with 4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one hydrochloride (CGP 12177) at the human beta1-adrenoceptor have provided evidence for two binding modes or conformations that have markedly different pharmacological properties. Here, key transmembrane residues (Asp104, Asp138, Ser228, Ser229, Ser232, Phe341, Asn344 and Asn363) have been mutated to provide structural insights into the nature of these conformations. [(3)H]CGP 12177 binding and cAMP response element-mediated reporter gene studies confirmed that CGP 12177 was a neutral antagonist (log K(D) = -9.18) at the \"catecholamine site\" and an agonist at the \"CGP 12177 site\" (log EC(50) = -8.12). Agonist responses to isoprenaline and CGP 12177 had different sensitivities to beta1-antagonists (e.g., CGP 20712A; log K(D) = -8.65 and -7.26, respectively). Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Asn363 and Asp138 were key residues for binding of agonists and antagonists, and they were also essential for the agonist actions of CGP 12177. S228A and S229A in transmembrane-spanning region (TM) 5 reduced the binding of CGP 12177 and had an identical effect on its agonist and antagonist actions. Both N344A and F341A in TM6 abolished the ability of CGP 20712A to discriminate between responses elicited by isoprenaline and CGP 12177. The fact that both Asp138 and Asn363 are absolutely required for CGP 12117 binding in both agonist and antagonist modes leads to the conclusion that the secondary agonist binding site for CGP 12117 must overlap with the catecholamine binding site. Modeling studies provide a basis for these overlapping sites with either the tert-butylamino group or the hydroxyethyloxy and imidazolone portions of CGP 12177 capable of forming polar interactions with Asp138 and Asn363.", 
    "12": "Evidence indicates that sympathetic nerves and substance P (SP) are involved in some physiological and pathophysiological changes and activities in retina. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SP participates in the stress reaction and possible involvement of adrenergic mechanisms in modulation of the changes of SP in the retina of the rats suffering from acute stress evoked by coronary artery occlusion (CAO). The changes of SP in retina were examined and analyzed within 6h of CAO using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and EIA approaches. The effects of phentolamine, an antagonist of alpha1-adrenergic receptor, and esmolol, an antagonist of beta1-adrenergic receptor, on the changes of SP were investigated to examine the role of adrenergic mechanisms in modulation of expression of SP in the retina under the stressful condition. It was observed that SP was markedly up-regulated in the layers of ganglion cells, inner plexiform, inner nuclear and pigment epithelium within 6h of the CAO. Intravenous administration of the adrenergic antagonists attenuated the up-regulation of SP. The results may indicate that SP in retina was involved in the stress response induced by acute myocardial ischemia. Adrenergic mechanisms may modulate the process in the retina.", 
    "13": "The inhibitory effects of cationic drugs (beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists, calcium (Ca)-channel blocker, I(f) channel inhibitor, antiarrhythmic drugs, and antibacterial drugs) that inhibit 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP) and/or metformin uptake into hOCT1-3/rOct1-3-expressing cells and human/rat hepatocytes were investigated in this study. The drug-drug interaction (DDI) potential of these drugs for the hOCT/rOct-mediated hepatic/renal uptake process was also assessed. The IC(50) values of cardiovascular drugs, including an I(f) channel inhibitor with a new mechanism of action, were greater for hOCT2/rOct2 than those for hOCT1/rOct1 or hOCT3/rOct3. No species differences in these values were observed between hOCTs and rOcts. As for hOCT2-mediated uptake, the IC(50) values of quinidine and the I(f) channel inhibitor for metformin uptake were lower than those for MPP uptake. However, previous clinical studies found that the IC(50) values of these drugs for hOCT1/rOct1 and hOCT2/rOct2 were much greater than their unbound plasma concentrations, which suggests that the DDIs of these cationic compounds may not be related to hOCT/rOct-mediated hepatic/renal uptake pathways. In addition, investigation of the luminal transporters of cationic compounds in the kidney, as well as the in vitro DDI potential of their inhibitors, is important for the clarification of cationic compound DDIs in humans.", 
    "14": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of landiolol on the cardiovascular responses to emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation. Fifty-nine patients without cardiovascular disorders who were scheduled for tympanoplasty were randomly allocated to receive a loading dose of landiolol at 0.125 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 1 min, followed by an infusion at 0.01 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (group L1), 0.02 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (group L2), 0.03 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (group L3), or 0.04 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (group L4). At the end of surgery, sevoflurane and nitrous oxide were discontinued, and landiolol was started. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and rate pressure product (RPP) in the four groups were compared before anesthesia induction, just after extubation, 5 min after extubation, 10 min after extubation, and at discharge from the operating room. Just after extubation compared with the baseline, the MAP increased significantly in all groups; the HR increased in groups L1 and L2; and the RPP increased in all groups, except for group L4. Continuous administration of landiolol, at 0.03 or 0.04 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1), may prevent the increases in HR and RPP, respectively, that occur at the emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation.", 
    "15": "Here, we describe three patients with severe hemodynamic instability after mitral valve annuloplasty (MVP) who were treated successfully using a new ultra-short-acting beta-blocker, landiolol hydrochloride. When systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve occurs after MVP, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and mitral regurgitation (MR) often lead to hemodynamic collapse. Treatment of SAM is very difficult, and transfusion, or the reduction/discontinuation of catecholamine or vasopressor administration, is often ineffective. In our three patients, landiolol hydrochloride decreased the heart rate, markedly attenuated SAM, and improved the hemodynamics. We recommend that landiolol be administered before further surgical manipulation is considered in patients with SAM after MVP.",

    "18": "All the cardiovascular drug classes were negatively or not associated with use of any antidepressant, non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors, and SSRIs, after adjustment for age, sex, and number of other dispensed drugs. However, propranolol was associated with an increased use of any antidepressant, non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors, and SSRIs, after adjustment for age, sex, and number of other dispensed drugs. Atenolol was positively associated with non-selective monoamine reuptake inhibitors, although to a lesser extent than propranolol.", 
    "19": "None of the cardiovascular drug classes were associated with increased antidepressant drug use, after adjustment for age, sex, and use of other drugs. However, when focusing specifically on beta-blockers, our results indicate that propranolol may be the beta-blocker most closely associated with use of antidepressants in the elderly.", 
    "20": "The theory of memory reconsolidation relates to the hypothesized restabilisation process that occurs following the reactivation of a memory through retrieval. Thus the demonstration of reactivation-dependent amnesia for a previously acquired memory is a prerequisite for showing that such a memory undergoes reconsolidation. Here we show that the appetitive Pavlovian representations that underlie Pavlovian approach and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer are destabilized following their retrieval. This reactivation-dependent amnesia demonstrates that the general motivational or incentive properties of appetitive conditioned stimuli, as well as their conditioned reinforcing properties, can be reduced by blocking memory reconsolidation.", 
    "21": "Methylphenidate treatment is used for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and can improve learning and memory. Previously, improvements were considered a by-product of increased attention; however, we hypothesize that methylphenidate directly alters mechanisms underlying learning and memory, and therefore examined its effects on hippocampal long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Methylphenidate enhanced both mechanisms in the absence of presynaptic changes and in a noradrenalin beta-receptor-dependent manner. These findings can explain both the improved learning and memory and decreased learning selectivity found with methylphenidate treatment and constitute the first demonstration of direct actions of methylphenidate on mechanisms implicated in cognition.", 
    "22": "Both nonlinear and fractal properties of beat-to-beat R-R interval variability signal (RRV) of freely moving lizards (Gallotia galloti) were studied in baseline and under autonomic nervous system blockade. Nonlinear techniques allowed us to study the complexity, chaotic behavior, nonlinearity, stationarity, and regularity over time of RRV. Scaling behavior of RRV was studied by means of fractal techniques. The autonomic nervous system blockers used were atropine, propranolol, prazosin, and yohimbine. The nature of RRV was linear in baseline and under beta-, alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor blockades. Atropine changed the linear nature of RRV to nonlinear and increased its stationarity, regularity and fractality. Propranolol increased the complexity and chaotic behavior, and decreased the stationarity, regularity, and fractality of RRV. Both prazosin and yohimbine did not change any of the nonlinear and fractal properties of RRV. It is suggested that 1) the use of both nonlinear and fractal analysis is an appropriate approach for studying cardiac period variability in reptiles; 2) the cholinergic activity, which seems to make the alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta-adrenergic activity interaction unnecessary, determines the linear behavior in basal RRV; 3) fractality, as well as both RRV regularity and stationarity over time, may result from the balance between cholinergic and beta-adrenergic activities opposing actions; 4) beta-adrenergic activity may buffer both the complexity and chaotic behavior of RRV, and 5) neither the alpha(1)- nor the alpha(2)-adrenergic activity seem to be involved in the mediation of either nonlinear or fractal components of RRV.", 
    "23": "This study identifies signaling pathways activated by the beta(2)-/beta(3)-adrenoceptor (AR) agonist zinterol, the selective beta(3)-AR agonist L755507, and the selective beta(3)-AR antagonist L748337 in CHO-K1 cells expressing human beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Zinterol and L755507 caused a robust concentration-dependent increase in cAMP accumulation (pEC(50) values of 8.5 and 12.3, respectively), whereas L748337 had low efficacy. Maximal cAMP accumulation with zinterol and L755507 was increased after pretreatment with pertussis toxin, indicating that the human beta(3)-AR couples to G(i) and to G(s). In contrast to cAMP, zinterol, L755507 and L748337 increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) with very high potency (pEC(50) values of 10.9, 11.7, and 11.6). These compounds also stimulated phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but with much lower potency than Erk1/2 (pEC(50) values of 5.9, 5.5, and 5.7, respectively). Pertussis toxin completely blocked Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in response to L748337, demonstrating a requirement for G(i/o) coupling, whereas L755507-stimulated p38 MAPK phosphorylation was not inhibited by pertussis toxin, and Erk1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited by only 30%. We found that high levels of cAMP interfered with agonist-activated p38 MAPK phosphorylation. L748337 increased extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in the cytosensor microphysiometer with efficacy similar to zinterol and L755507, albeit with lower potency (pEC(50) value of 7.2 compared with zinterol, 8.1, and L755507, 8.6). The ECAR response to L748337 was largely via activation of p38 MAPK, demonstrated by 65% inhibition with 4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(3-phenylpropyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-butyn-1-ol (RWJ67657). We conclude that the beta(3)-AR agonist L755507 couples to both G(s) and G(i) to activate adenylate cyclase and MAPK signaling, whereas the beta(3)-AR antagonist L748337 couples predominantly to G(i) to activate MAPK signaling.",

Four of the compounds, which differ in the alkyl substitution of phenylcarbamate (methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl), were chosen for basic in vitro pharmacological analyses. In experiments on the isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig atria all compounds at conc. of 1.0.10(-6) mol.l(-1) decreased the basic heart rate (7.6-13.6%) and inhibited the positive chronotropic effect of isoprenaline (pA2 = 6.28-6.81).

However, the cellular and subcellular distributions of beta1- and beta2-ARs in the BLA and their roles in fear memory formation are poorly understood. Here, we report that both beta1- and beta2-ARs are predominantly expressed in BLA neurons but not in astrocytes. beta1-AR is distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of neurons, whereas beta2-AR is localized not only in the cell membrane and cytoplasm but also in the nucleus. Intra-BLA infusion of the beta1-AR antagonist metoprolol and atenolol or the beta2-AR antagonist ICI118551 and butoxamine produces a severe deficit in 24-h auditory fear memory, leaving 1-h memory intact. Western-blot analysis reveals that the protein level of cytoplasmic beta1-AR significantly increases 2- and 4-h postconditioning, whereas that of cytoplasmic or nuclear beta2-AR is unchanged. The present results indicate that beta1- and beta2-ARs in the BLA have differential subcellular localizations and both are required for the consolidation of auditory fear memory.",

    "53": "Out of 105 patients identified with ABS, 6 (5.7%) women aged 69 +/- 9 years experienced significant arrhythmia (ventricular fibrillation, asystole), 2 patients died, and 1 required permanent pacemaker implantation. When compared with controls, the study group showed no significant difference with respect to ECG characteristics (QT, QRS duration or axis) except for R-R interval variability (see comments below) (30.6+/-6 vs 14.5+/-17 p = 0.0004), QTc, and P-R interval. Patients without arrhythmia were more likely to be on beta-blocker therapy than the study population (33% vs 80.6% p = 0.02).", 
    "54": "Life-threatening arrhythmia is uncommon (5.7%) with ABS despite marked, structural abnormalities. When arrhythmias do occur, the outcome is poor. Prominent variability in R-R intervals appears to be predictive of significant arrhythmias in ABS. The role of beta-blocker therapy in preventing arrhythmia with ABS requires further investigation.", 
    "55": "The effects of corticosterone (CORT), a natural glucocorticoid hormone, on ATP-induced currents in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and the underlying signaling mechanism were studied by using patch-clamp techniques. Three types of currents (fast, slow and mixed) were evoked by ATP in cultured DRG neurons. Pretreatment with CORT (0.01-10 mumol/l) for 30 s could inhibit the fast current and the fast component of the mixed current. In contrast, CORT had no significant effect on the slow current evoked by ATP. The inhibitory effects were concentration dependent, reversible and could be blocked by glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 (10 micromol/l), but not by GDP-beta-S (0.2 mmol/l), a blocker of G protein activation. Membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated corticosterone failed to mimic the effects of CORT. The inhibitory effects of CORT on ATP-induced currents diminished after adding protein kinase A inhibitor H89 (10 micromol/l), but were not influenced by protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine chloride (10 micromol/l). These results suggest that glucocorticoid hormones might participate in the control of pain by modulating P2X(3) receptor-mediated events in sensory neurons, and the effect is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors and the downstream activation of protein kinase A.",

The authors retrospectively reviewed 86 patients with a diagnosis of DCM seen at a clinic during April-November 2005. The authors found 18 patients with elderly-onset idiopathic DCM (age of onset > or = 65 years, mean age 71.8 +/- 6.2 years), who had substantial improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > or = 20 units (%). During a mean follow-up of 8.6 +/- 5.5 years, mean LVEF and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter improved from 30.6 +/- 7.9% to 58.3 +/- 6.5% (p < 0.0001) and 57.5 +/- 7.0 mm to 44.6 +/- 5.5 mm (p < 0.0001), respectively Fifteen of the 18 patients (83%) had a history of hypertension. Systolic blood pressure at the initial referral clinic correlated with improved contractility (p = 0.0275, r = 0.52). The eighteen patients found in our small patient population suggest that substantial systolic improvement and reverse remodeling is seen in elderly patients with idiopathic DCM.",

    "58": "Identification and prevention of ischemia in patients undergoing vascular surgery remains controversial. While the identification of preoperative ischemia is a marker of a higher perioperative risk, the value of identifying such ischemia has been questioned. We believe this may be, at least in part, due to our limited understanding of perioperative MI. Appropriate management of patients, based on the results of such testing, is likely the key to improving outcomes, and deserves further investigation. Efforts aimed at reducing the ischemic consequences of severe coronary plaques (by revascularization or beta-blocker therapy) have yielded conflicting results. The use of high doses of preoperative beta-blocker therapy may be harmful. Some studies suggest a promising role for statin therapy. Benefits of acetylsalicylic acid must be weighted against the risk of bleeding.",

    "63": "T-wave alternans (TWA) in electrocardiography (ECG) is a marker of cardiac repolarization, the molecular regulation of which is incompletely understood. High TWA and prolonged QT intervals are both associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis of whether the same mutations that influence the QT interval also affect TWA variation. We examined the effect of 3 ion channel gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1805127, rs727957 KCNE1, and rs1805124 SCN5A, on TWA during a clinical exercise test. A total of 2008 subjects from the Finnish Cardiovascular Study underwent an exercise test with online ECG recording. TWA was measured by using the time-domain, modified moving average method. Maximum values at rest, during maximal exercise, and during recovery were used as outcome measures in statistical analysis. Moreover, 4-year survival data were collected and ion channel SNPs were determined. TWA was lowest in subjects with the TT genotype of rs1805127 during all phases of the exercise test (RANOVA main effect for genotype, P = 0.018). The result remained significant after adjustment for age, existing coronary heart disease, and beta-blocker medication status (RANCOVA, P = 0.035). Of the polymorphisms studied, only rs1805127 had a significant association with mortality (P = 0.047). The most common G-C haplotype, formed by rs727957 and rs1805127, was associated with TWA (RANOVA, P = 0.007) but not with mortality. The rs1805124 polymorphism was not associated with TWA. The common KCNE1 gene variant rs1805127 is associated with TWA during an exercise test in a Finnish population, which provides additional evidence that KCNE1 genetics may influence cardiac repolarization and cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "64": "The calculation of the adsorption energy distribution (AED) was recently introduced as an important tool for the chromatographic community for characterization of modern phases. The AED-calculations, provides model-independent information about the numbers of different adsorption sites and their respective energy-levels, prior to the selection of an adsorption isotherm model which narrows the number of possible rival models. The selection of a proper model for the fitting of the determined raw data is crucial; if the wrong model is selected misleading information about the retention mechanism may be drawn. The AED-calculations require raw adsorption isotherm data (i.e. data points) which is unfortunately not obtained by the newly validated perturbation peak method. In this study, we developed mathematical expression allowing the use of the raw tangential slope provided by the perturbation peak method for AED calculations. The approach worked excellently and was verified against both computer-generated adsorption isotherm data as well as experimentally determined data, using three different experimental systems. It was found that the calculations of the AED, as based on perturbation peak data, converts faster and are not more sensitive to experimental noise as compared to the classical AED calculations using raw adsorption isotherm data.",

We examined the impact of MD on long-term survival of patients with end-stage severe HF. We also evaluated the interaction between antidepressive medication and beta-blockers on the clinical outcome of these patients.",

Sixty-one percent of these patients suffered MD and were receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). All patients were followed prospectively for 18 months. The primary end point was cardiovascular death. At baseline, patients with severe MD had higher serum interleukin 6 (P < .05) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (P < .01). During the follow-up, 167 cardiovascular deaths were reported, and MD was 1 of the major predictors of cardiovascular death (P = .031), whereas treatment with angiotensin receptor inhibitors and statins were also important negative predictors of mortality (P = .036 and P = .039, respectively). Although beta-blockers had a borderline nonsignificant effect on cardiovascular mortality in the overall population, they had a striking beneficial effect among those patients with major depression receiving SSRIs (P = .006), whereas they had a negative effect on mortality in those patients receiving SNRIs/TCAs (P = .025).",

The diagnosis of somnambulism was confirmed polysomnographically and linked etiologically to the start of using metoprolol, a lipophilic beta-blocker, for treating her hypertension. The parasomnia disappeared completely after discontinuation of the drug. Recurrence of non-REM parasomnias, such as somnambulism, has previously been described as an adverse effect of the beta-blocker, propranolol, solely in patients with migraine. There was no history of migraine in the patient presented here. The clinical significance of the findings and possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.", 
    "74": "Drug-induced QT interval prolongation is a critical issue in development of new chemical entities, so the pharmaceutical industry needs to evaluate risk as early as possible. Common marmosets have been in the limelight in early-stage development due to their small size, which requires only a small amount of test drug. The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of telemetered common marmosets for predicting drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Telemetry transmitters were implanted in common marmosets (male and female), and QT and RR intervals were measured. The QT interval was corrected for the RR interval by applying Bazett's and Fridericia's correction formulas and individual rate correction. Individual correction showed the least slope for the linear regression of corrected QT (QTc) intervals against RR intervals, indicating that it dissociated changes in heart rate most effectively. With the individual correction method, the QT-prolonging drugs (astemizole, dl-sotalol) showed QTc interval prolongations and the non-QT-prolonging drugs (dl-propranolol, nifedipine) did not show QTc interval prolongations. The plasma concentrations of astemizole and dl-sotalol associated with QTc interval prolongations in common marmosets were similar to those in humans, suggesting that the sensitivity of common marmosets would be appropriate for evaluating risk of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. In conclusion, telemetry studies in common marmosets are useful for predicting clinical QT prolonging potential of drugs in early stage development and require only a small amount of test drug.", 
    "75": "Puerarin and daidzein are the major naturally occurring isoflavones in leguminous plants. These two compounds are metabolized to equol by human intestinal flora. Here we isolated two intestinal bacteria capable of metabolizing puerarin and daidzein, respectively, from human feces. One of them, strain PUE, converted puerarin to daidzein by cleaving a C-glucosyl bond, whereas the other, strain DZE, converted daidzein to equol by reducing a double bond in ring C followed by elimination of an oxo group. Based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence, strain DZE showed 85% similarity with Eggerthella lenta. Equol produced by strain DZE was identified as (3S)-equol through several analytical methods. Moreover, we obtained (3S)-equol from puerarin by co-incubation with strain PUE and DZE. In addition, 5-hydroxyequol was obtained from genistein by incubation with strain DZE.", 
    "76": "We have constructed a new ocular pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for anti-glaucoma drugs to describe ocular hypotensive effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) after instillation of a combination of an alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist, bunazosin, and a beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol, into rabbits. This model was constructed by the combination of two ocular PK/PD models for bunazosin and timolol by including aqueous humor dynamics based on both action mechanisms. We also verified the reliability of this model by confirming the drug concentrations in aqueous humor and ocular hypotensive effects after instillation of the drug combination. The aqueous humor concentrations of timolol and bunazosin were determined by an HPLC, and ocular hypotensive effect-time profiles were measured using a telemetry system, which was able to record automatically detailed effects. The combined model could simulate the aqueous humor concentrations of both drugs and the additive IOP-lowering effect after instillation of the combination using the MULTI (RUNGE) program and PK/PD parameters which were obtained from ocular hypotensive effects after instillation of bunazosin alone or timolol alone. The theoretical concentration curves of both drugs in the aqueous humor and the theoretical ocular hypotensive effect curves almost agreed with both the observed concentrations and ocular hypotensive effects after instillation of the drug combination. These results indicate the reliability and usefulness of PK/PD modeling considering aqueous humor dynamics to predict IOP in multidrug therapy. This is the first study to develop a PK/PD model for multidrug therapy for the eye.", 
    "77": "Based on our previous molecular modeling and radioligand binding study, we have demonstrated that aspartic acid of 104 in transmembrane helix (TMH) II of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)-AR) is important for functional characteristics of these receptors. We have also showed that mutation of negatively charged aspartic acid to neutral charged alanine exhibited constitutive activity of beta(1)-AR. However, the mutation of negatively charged aspartic acid to positively charged lysine is still remained to be examined, which is very important to know for fully understanding the characteristics of beta(1)-AR. At the present study, we mutated aspartic acid to lysine (Asp104Lys) residue in human beta(1)-AR. This resultant mutant (Asp104Lys) markedly reduced the binding affinity of isoproterenol and (-)-epinephrine. On the other hand, antagonist binding with this mutant was similar to the wild type receptor. Isoproterenol at its saturation concentrations produced lower amount of intracellular cyclic adenosine-3',5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) in HEK-293 cells expressing Asp104Lys mutant receptor as compared to cells expressing wild type receptor. Moreover, cAMP accumulation of Asp104Lys mutant was unchanged in the presence or absence of isoproterenol. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that Asp104Lys mutation in the human beta(1)-AR differentially affects the binding of antagonist and exhibits a functional uncoupling of G-protein-coupled receptors. Thus, we may suggest that mutation of negatively charged aspartic acid to positively charged lysine as well as neutral charged alanine may help to understand the mechanism of the activation or inactivation of beta(1)-AR by its conformational changes and this finding would be helpful for clarifying the functional responses mediated by beta(1)-AR.",

    "81": "Dynamics of high-frequency components of heart periodogram whose main part is respiratory arrhythmia (RA) as well as consequences of vagotomy, block of M-cholinoreceptors by atropine and of beta-adrenoreceptors by propranolol was studied in Wistar white rats in a large age diapason from 2-4 days to adults. It was established that results of the actions in immature rats did not essentially differ from those observed in adult rats and described in animals of other species and in human. In rats of young age, predominant in genesis of RA is peripheral mechanism. Vagotomy produces an elevation of the RA amplitude due to a sharp increase of the inspiration time as well as to deafferentation. Sympathetic nervous system produces restricting action on RA. This role is preserved in animals of all age groups. Participation of parasympathetic innervation in the RA genesis is revealed from the third week and continues increasing to the mature age. However, in adult rats, the peripheral mechanism of the RA formation is preserved, as disturbance of parasympathetic innervation leads not to the disappearance of RA, but only to a decrease of its amplitude.", 
    "82": "Endoscopic band ligation is an effective technique for primary and secondary prevention of gastro-esophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB), but can also result in rebleeding from postbanding ulcers. Its use in primary and secondary prevention of GEVB in anticoagulated patients has not been systematically studied. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of band ligation in primary and secondary prevention of GEVB in anticoagulated patients. Five patients (age 60.2+/-7.3 SD years: 3 males, 2 females) with esophageal varices on anticoagulation were studied using a retrospective chart review in a tertiary hospital setting. Patients were on mandatory anticoagulation with warfarin (international normalized ratio >2), on nonselective beta-blocker therapy if tolerated and were not transvenous intrahepatic porto-systemic shunting candidates. One patient had polycythemia vera (noncirrhotic), the rest were cirrhotics Child class B/C (1 cardiogenic, 1 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 1 Budd-Chiari, and 1 cryptogenic cirrhosis). Two patients had experienced prior acute GEVB; band ligation performed during acute bleeding was not included in the study. All patients had at least grade III-IV esophageal varices on outpatient follow-up for band ligation. Three bands were placed/patient and study patients underwent 3 banding sessions on an average. None of the patients developed GEVB after band ligation. In 3 patients banding resulted in complete variceal eradication, the remaining 2 are still being followed-up for outpatient band ligation. In conclusion, this case series suggests that endoscopic band ligation can potentially be used in anticoagulated patients without alternatives for prevention of acute GEVB.", 
    "83": "Peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid bodies are the primary sensors of systemic hypoxia. Although the pattern of responses elicited by peripheral chemoreceptor activation is well established in rats, lambs, and rabbits, the cardiovascular responses to peripheral chemoreflex activation in conscious mice have not been delineated. Here we report that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors by potassium cyanide (KCN) in conscious mice elicits a unique biphasic response in blood pressure that is characterized by an initial and robust rise followed by a decrease in blood pressure, which is accompanied by a marked reduction in heart rate. The depressor and bradycardic responses to KCN were abolished by muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine, and the pressor response was abolished by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with prazosin, suggesting that vagal and sympathetic drive to the heart and sympathetic drive to the vasculature mediate these cardiovascular responses. These studies characterized the chemoreflex in conscious mice and established the reliability of using them for studying hypoxia-related diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea. In another series of experiments, two methods for analyzing baroreflex sensitivity were compared: the classical pharmacological approach using phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside (i.e., the Oxford technique) or the sequence method for analyzing spontaneous baroreflex activity. Our findings indicate that both methods are reliable, and the sequence method certainly has its benefits as a predictive tool in the context of long-term noninvasive studies using telemetry. However, for absolute determination of baroreflex function, analysis of spontaneous baroreflex activity should be complemented by the classical pharmacological method.", 
    "84": "Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience. The neural systems underlying the sensory component of pain have been studied extensively, but we are only beginning to understand those underlying its affective component. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) has been implicated in stress responses and negative affective states, such as anxiety, fear, and aversion. Recently, we demonstrated the crucial role of the BNST in the negative affective component of pain using the conditioned place aversion (CPA) test. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of the beta-adrenoceptor-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway within the BNST, in particular, within the ventral part of the BNST (vBNST), in pain-induced aversion in male Sprague Dawley rats. In vivo microdialysis showed that extracellular noradrenaline levels within the vBNST were significantly increased by intraplantar formalin injection. Using the CPA test, we found that intra-vBNST injection of timolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, dose-dependently attenuated the intraplantar-formalin-induced CPA (F-CPA) without reducing nociceptive behaviors. Experiments with subtype-selective antagonists demonstrated the essential role of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in F-CPA. Intra-vBNST injection of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, dose-dependently produced CPA even in the absence of noxious stimulation. This isoproterenol-induced CPA was reversed by the coinjection of Rp-cyclic adenosine monophosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS), a selective PKA inhibitor. Furthermore, intra-vBNST injection of Rp-cAMPS dose-dependently attenuated the F-CPA. Together, these results suggest that PKA activation within the vBNST via the enhancement of beta-adrenergic transmission is important for the negative affective component of pain.", 
    "85": "Cardiovascular drugs are characterized by wide inter-individual variability in dose/plasma concentration/ response (therapeutic and/or toxic) relationships. Therefore, some patients achieve good therapeutic response to their drug therapy, while others do not. Also, some patients experience adverse effects, which vary from mild to life-threatening. The source of variability in patients' response to cardiovascular drugs may be of pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic origin. Many factors can potentially affect both of them such as genetics, gender, age, disease state, environmental factors like smoking and food, possible drug-drug interactions, and ethnicity (race). Cardiovascular pharmacogenomics is a new field that focus on the roles of genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing enzymes and drug targets in development of variable drug response.", 
    "86": "Both medical therapy and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) have proven to be comparable in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. However, the long-term results are still lacking. Our previous study enrolled 121 patients with history of esophageal variceal bleeding and randomized to receive EVL (EVL group, 60 patients) or drug therapy, nadolol plus isosorbide-5-mononitrate (N+I) (N+I group, 61 patients) to prevent variceal rebleeding. The EVL group received ligation regularly until variceal obliteration. The N+I group received N+I during the study period. Patients were followed for up to 8 years. After a median follow-up of 82 months, recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding developed in 28 patients (47%) in the EVL group and 49 patients (80%) in the N+I group (P = 0.001). Recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices occurred in 18 patients (30%) in the EVL group and 39 patients (64%) in the N+I group. The actuarial probability of rebleeding from esophageal varices was lower in the EVL group (P = 0.001). A total of 42 patients of the EVL group and 30 patients of the N+I group died (P = 0.013). The multivariate Cox analysis indicated that age, serum albumin, presence of encephalopathy, and treatment were the factors predictive of mortality.",

Participants were grouped into categories according to previous drug regimens: those on timolol monotherapy; those on prostaglandin analog (PGA) monotherapy; those on concomitant therapy with a PGA and timolol; and those on fixed combinations. Trav/tim was well accepted by the patients, with 87.9% judging the tolerability of the therapy as good, very good, or excellent. Analysis of intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements showed statistically significant IOP decreases in all four categories examined in our study after regimen substitution with fixed-combination trav/tim. Fixed-combination prostaglandin analog/beta-blocker formulations are an attractive therapeutic option due to their strong IOP-lowering efficacy with once-daily dosing. In this study, glaucoma patients who underwent a regimen modification to fixed-combination trav/tim showed further reductions in IOP, irrespective of which selected monoor multiple therapies had been used previously.",

    "94": "Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited arrhythmic disorder in which patients display a propensity for prolongation of the heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) and for sudden cardiac death. To obtain a better understanding of this disease, the International LQTS Registry was initiated in 1979, and has been an invaluable source of data on patients aged 40 years and younger with LQTS. The registry collaborators have now described 2,759 LQTS patients and controls aged older than 40 years. In this age group, a prolonged QTc, syncope in the last 10 years, and LQTS-3 were found to be the most important predictors of death from any cause or cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation in patients with LQTS (hazard ratios 2.65-9.92). Clearly, patients with LQTS remain at increased risk of lethal events after 40 years of age, indicating that continuous, age-independent awareness for QT prolongation is essential.",

Cohort entry was at day 90 post-AMI; subjects were followed for 1 year. Four groups were identified: (i) non-users (patients never on statins); (ii) users (on statins before and continued post-AMI); (iii) starters (started statins after the event); and (iv) stoppers (stopped statins after the event). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards model. The main outcome measure was 1-year all-cause mortality. The cohort included 9939 AMI survivors (mean age: 68.4 \u00b1 12.8 years; 60.3% men), 22.7% of whom were not prescribed a statin post-AMI. When the non-user group (n = 2124) was considered as the reference, the adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) of death were 0.84 (0.66-1.09) for users (n = 2026), 0.72 (0.57-0.90) for starters (n = 5652), and 1.88 (1.13-3.07) for stoppers (n = 137).

Paced left atria and right ventricular strips were set-up in Krebs solution and isometric developed tension recorded. Ischaemia was simulated by replacing with hypoxic glucose-free Krebs solution for 30 min. IPC and isoprenaline (10(-7) M) preconditioning for 10 min were examined. Developed tension post-reoxygenation was expressed as a percentage of the pre-ischaemic baseline.

    "107": "Na(+) transport across epithelia is mediated in part by the epithelial Na(+) channel ENaC. Previous work indicates that Na(+) is an important regulator of ENaC, providing a negative feedback mechanism to maintain Na(+) homeostasis. ENaC is synthesized as an inactive precursor, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domains of the alpha and gamma subunits. Here we found that Na(+) regulates ENaC in part by altering proteolytic activation of the channel. When the Na(+) concentration was low, we found that the majority of ENaC at the cell surface was in the cleaved/active state. As Na(+) increased, there was a dose-dependent decrease in ENaC cleavage and, hence, ENaC activity. This Na(+) effect was dependent on Na(+) permeation; cleavage was increased by the ENaC blocker amiloride and by a mutation that decreases ENaC activity (alpha(H69A)) and was reduced by a mutation that activates ENaC (beta(S520K)). Moreover, the Na(+) ionophore monensin reversed the effect of the inactivating mutation (alpha(H69A)) on ENaC cleavage, suggesting that intracellular Na(+) regulates cleavage. Na(+) did not alter activity of Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that modulates ENaC cleavage, but Na(+) reduced ENaC cleavage by exogenous trypsin. Our findings support a model in which intracellular Na(+) regulates cleavage by altering accessibility of ENaC cleavage sites to proteases and provide a molecular explanation for the earlier observation that intracellular Na(+) inhibits Na(+) transport via ENaC (Na(+) feedback inhibition).",

In clinical practice, the choice of beta-blockers for individual patients with hypertension is often based on practical issues such as convenience and cost. However, given the pharmacologic and clinical trial data demonstrating differences, the choice of beta-blocker for the treatment of high-risk hypertension should be evidence-based. Vasodilating beta-blockers, such as carvedilol, decrease blood pressure without the concerning hemodynamic, renal, and metabolic responses associated with most beta-blockers.

However, they are not utilized in a substantial portion of eligible HF patients, possibly because physicians are unsure of the safety and benefit of beta-blockers in special populations (women, the elderly, African Americans, patients with diabetes, and patients with atrial fibrillation). The current standard of care is to treat all heart failure (HF) patients according to the recommendations for the overall population. A review of the clinical trial data reveals that there is no evidence that one evidence-based beta-blocker is preferential over the others in women or in the elderly with HF. In contrast, carvedilol may confer greater benefit in HF patients with diabetes and atrial fibrillation as well as in African American patients.

    "127": "Noradrenergic activation of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) modulates the consolidation of memory for many kinds of highly emotionally arousing training tasks. The present experiments investigated whether posttraining noradrenergic activation of the BLA is sufficient to enable memory consolidation of a low-arousing training experience. Sprague-Dawley rats received intra-BLA infusions of norepinephrine, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or saline immediately after either 3 or 10 min of object recognition training. Saline-infused controls exhibited poor 24-h retention when given 3 min of object recognition training and good retention when given 10 min of training. Norepinephrine administered after 3 min of object recognition training produced dose-dependent enhancement of 24-h object recognition memory whereas propranolol administered after 10 min of training produced dose-dependent impairment of memory. These findings provide evidence that posttraining noradrenergic activation of the BLA enhances memory of a low-arousing training experience that would otherwise not induce long-term memory. Thus, regardless of the degree of emotional arousal induced by an experience, noradrenergic activation of the BLA after the experience ensures that it will be better remembered.",

We will discuss in this review of the literature the current therapeutic management of HF-PSF, including the role of precipitating factors such as hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and supraventricular arrhythmias, and the main results of epidemiological registries and randomized controlled clinical trials in this disease. Only four large therapeutic trials have assessed the impact of different classes of drugs (digoxin, angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptors type I blockers and beta-blockers) on morbidity and mortality in HF-PSF. Results of these trials are disappointing. Apart from the beta-blockers, the other three classes of drugs did not show benefit on the outcome of the disease. Moreover, the results of the beta-blocker trial are controversial as a mixed population of heart failure with and without preserved systolic function was studied. Finally, the current therapeutic management of patients with HF-PSF is still based on our pathophysiological knowledge: education, low salt diet, diuretics, slowing heart rate and controlling triggering factors.

    "152": "It is often assumed that beta-blockers, e.g. metoprolol (METO), induce erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. However, cardiovascular diseases can also induce ED and there is also the possibility that psychological factors, such as fear of the disease and side effects of the prescribed drug, may also induce ED. Thus, it is often assumed that beta-blockers induce ED in a large percentage of men, but this statement is not well validated and the role of the pharmacologic effect of METO per se on the occurrence of ED is largely unknown. To get an answer we selected 114 men (age 57 +/- 4.7 years) without ED but with newly diagnosed arterial hypertension, and who could be treated with METO.", 
    "153": "METO (100 mg/day) was given as a retard formulation. The hypertensive men were randomized into 3 groups. In group 1 patients were fully informed (they knew that the drug was METO and that it might induce ED). In group 2 patients were partially informed (they knew that the drug was METO, but were not informed that it might induce ED). In group 3 patients were not informed either about the drug used or about the possible occurrence of ED. The first phase of the study lasted 60 days. After 60 days the incidence of ED was 32% in group 1, 13% in group 2, and 8% in group 3 (p < 0.01). All patients with ED entered the second, cross-over, double-blind phase of the study. METO was continued at unchanged dosage, and tadalafil (20 mg) and a placebo were given to treat ED.", 
    "154": "Both treatments were equally effective.", 
    "155": "Prejudice about the possible occurrence, i.e. the Hawthorne effect, of ED with METO facilitates the occurrence of this side effect in hypertensive men. Since the etiology of this ED is largely psychological, it is not surprising that placebo is as effective as tadalafil in reversing this side effect.", 
    "156": "Carvedilol and bisoprolol reduce QT dispersion (QTD) in chronic heart failure (CHF). However, it is unclear whether there is a difference between the effects of the two drugs. The aim of the present study was to compare the long-term effects of carvedilol and bisoprolol on QTD in patients with CHF.", 
    "157": "Eighty-one patients with CHF with no previous beta-blocker therapy were included in this prospective study. The patients were randomly allocated to carvedilol or bisoprolol therapy. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), heart rate (HR), QTD, and corrected QTD (QTcD) were calculated at baseline and at the 6th month of therapy.", 
    "158": "In comparison to baseline values in both therapy groups, LVEF was significantly improved, and a statistically significant decrease was found in HR (carvedilol from 76 +/- 12 to 65 +/- 10 beats/min, p < 0.001; bisoprolol from 78 +/- 13 to 65 +/- 8 beats/min, p < 0.001) and QTcD (carvedilol from 85 +/- 28 to 65 +/- 22 ms, p < 0.001; bisoprolol from 83 +/- 22 to 61 +/- 20 ms, p < 0.001). In our study, carvedilol and bisoprolol were found to have similar effects on LVEF, HR, and QTcD.",

    "162": "Medline and Embase were used to identify studies that gave a hazard or relative risk ratio for systolic blood pressure in a stable population with CHF. Included studies were analysed to obtain a unified hazard ratio and quantify the degree of confidence.", 
    "163": "10 studies met the inclusion criteria, giving a total population of 8088, with 29 222 person-years of follow-up. All studies showed that a higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a favourable prognostic marker in CHF, in contrast to the general population where it is an indicator of poorer prognosis. The decrease in mortality rates associated with a 10 mm Hg higher SBP was 13.0% (95% CI 10.6% to 15.4%) in the heart failure population. This was not related to aetiology, ACE inhibitor or beta blocker use.", 
    "164": "SBP is an easily measured, continuous variable that has a remarkably consistent relationship with mortality within the CHF population. The potential of this simple variable in outpatient assessment of patients with CHF should not be neglected. One possible application of this information is in the optimisation of cardiac resynchronisation devices.", 
    "165": "Atrial tachyarrhythmias are a chronic long-term hazard in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). These arrhythmias contribute to ventricular dysfunction, heart failure can contribute to sudden death. We performed a prospective study of oral sotalol for the conversion of atrial tachyarrhythmias in adults and adolescents with congenital heart disease and stable hemodynamics.", 
    "166": "Patients were admitted and given oral sotalol in an inpatient, monitored setting. The initial dose was targeted at 2 mg/kg. Antiarrhythmic drugs other than digoxin were stopped.", 
    "167": "Nineteen patients were enrolled. The average patient age was 20 years (12-39). Four had atrial ectopic tachycardia (AET) and 15 had atrial reentry tachycardia (IART). Nine had Fontan physiology. Permanent pacing therapies had failed to restore sinus or paced rhythm consistently in 6 patients. Overall 16 of 19 atrial tachyarrhythmias (84%) converted with single dose oral sotalol. AET converted to sinus or paced rhythm in 3/4 patients and IART in 13/15 patients. The average times to conversion were 98 and 145 min, respectively. Two patients required pacemakers due to sinus bradycardia. One patient had a lethal thromboembolic event 2 days after conversion.", 
    "168": "Oral sotalol offers an effective alternative to direct current cardioversion in adults and adolescents with CHD and hemodynamically stable atrial tachyarrhythmias. Conversion with sotalol at ~2 mg/kg generally occurred within 2 h. Vigilance for thromboembolism must be maintained as well as caution for those with bradycardia without pacemakers in this patient population. There are theoretical and practical advantages of sotalol over cardioversion.", 
    "169": "The aim was to establish a robust, 96-well, cell-based assay to assess the potency and persistence of action of agonists acting at human recombinant beta(2) adrenoceptors expressed in CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells and to compare this with published duration of action data in guinea pig isolated trachea and human bronchus.", 
    "170": "Cells were treated with either: (i) beta-adrenoceptor agonist for 30 min, washed and cyclicAMP (cAMP) measured 30 min later-termed 'washed' cells or, (ii) treated with solvent for 30 min, washed, and then treated with beta-adrenoceptor agonist for 30 min and cAMP measured-termed 'unwashed' cells. The 'washed' EC(50) was divided by the 'unwashed' EC(50) to determine a rightward shift concentration ratio, which was indicative of the persistence of action at the receptor.", 
    "171": "At the beta(2) adrenoceptor salmeterol, carmoterol and indacaterol were resistant to washing with a concentration ratio of <5, indicating a long persistence of action, whereas formoterol, isoprenaline and salbutamol were washed out with a ratio of 32, >294 and >800 respectively, suggesting a shorter persistence of action. At beta(1) and beta(3) adrenoceptors all compounds washed out. The persistent effects of salmeterol at beta(2) following washing could be reversed by the selective beta(2) antagonist ICI 118551, suggesting continued receptor activation.", 
    "172": "The data presented agree well with published data assessing duration of action of beta(2) agonists in human isolated bronchus and guinea pig isolated trachea. Key features are: (a) it is a 96-well format which can be used to assess many compounds in a single experiment, (b) both potency and persistence of agonist action are assessed in the same assay, (c) any effects of concentration on the persistence of action can be highlighted, and (d) it allows triage of compounds prior to tissue bath studies thus reducing the use of animal tissue.", 
    "173": "Recent clinical trials reported conflicting results on the reduction of new-onset diabetes using RAS blocking agents. Therefore the role of these agents in preventing diabetes is still not well defined. Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor (ACEi), that has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in high risk patients and post-hoc analyses of the HOPE trial have provided evidence for its beneficial action in the prevention of diabetes.", 
    "174": "The ADaPT investigation (\"ACE inhibitor-based versus diuretic-based antihypertensive primary treatment in patients with pre-diabetes\") is a 4-year open, prospective, parallel group phase IV study. It compares an antihypertensive treatment regimen based on ramipril versus a treatment based on diuretics or betablockers. The primary evaluation criterion is the first manifestation of type 2 diabetes. The study is conducted in primary care to allow the broadest possible application of its results. The present article provides an outline of the rationale, the design and baseline characteristics of AdaPT and compares these to previous studies including ASCOT-BLPA, VALUE and DREAM.", 
    "175": "Until March 2006 a total of 2,015 patients in 150 general practices (general physicians and internists) throughout Germany were enrolled. The average age of patients enrolled was 67.1 +/- 10.3 years, with 47% being male and a BMI of 29.9 +/- 5.0 kg/m2. Dyslipidemia was present in 56.5%. 37.8% reported a family history of diabetes, 57.8% were previously diagnosed with hypertension (usually long standing). The HbA1c value at baseline was 5.6 %. Compared to the DREAM study patients were older, had more frequently hypertension and patients with cardiovascular disease were not excluded.", 
    "176": "Comparing the ADaPT design and baseline data to previous randomized controlled trial it can be acknowledged that AdaPT included patients with a high risk for diabetes development. Results are expected to be available in 2010. Data will be highly valuable for clinical practice due to the observational study design.", 
    "177": "Neurotoxicant-induced elevation of intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)) and modulation by phystoestrogens were examined in vitro using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells cultured with amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridine (MPP+). Although Abeta itself did not increase Ca(2+), it exacerbated the effects of carbachol. The elevation of Ca(2+) caused by the agents in combination could be reduced by pretreatment with the phytoestrogens equol and genistein, as well as by the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine. MPP+ exposure also elevated Ca(2+), an effect blocked by nifedipine but not by the phytoestrogens. As opposed to phytoestrogens, nifedipine was also able to significantly reduce cell death caused by higher concentrations of MPP(+) in the LDH viability assay. The results suggest that phytoestrogens are unlikely to serve as general cellular protectants for neurotoxicants with different mechanisms of action. The concentrations of Abeta and MPP(+) affecting Ca(2+) release did not inhibit cell viability as measured with the LDH release assay. This indicates that mechanisms involved with toxicity can be studied at doses that are not lethal.",

    "180": "AF occurred in 28% (61/217) of the patients. In univariate analysis the age of the patients with AF was higher (p = 0.0033), they had a longer history of coronary disease (p = 0.0417) and more had > 3 grafts (p < 0.05). Low ejection fraction (< 40%) was also a risk factor of arrhythmia (p < 0.0001). In multivariate regression analysis two independent predictors of AF were identified: no ACE inhibitor treatment before surgery (p = 0.0005) and age > 60 years (p < 0.01). Patients with AF had a higher mean heart rate after the procedure: 115 +/- 34 vs. 78 +/- 21/min (p < 0.0005). Patients treated with ACE inhibitors before and after surgery had a lower incidence of AF than non-treated patients: 8% vs. 48% (p < 0.0001) and 4% vs. 61%, p < 0.0001) respectively. Beta-blocker treatment before and after surgery resulted in a lower incidence of AF: at 23% vs. 75% (p < 0.001) and 19% vs. 96% (p < 0.0001), respectively.", 
    "181": "No ACE inhibitor therapy before surgery, advanced age, low ejection fraction, high post-procedure heart rate, duration of coronary disease and the number of grafts (corresponding to the length of the procedure) were found to be strong probable predictors of AF following cardiac surgery. ACE inhibitor therapy may be effective in the prevention of newonset AF. Treatment based on individual variables is crucial for proper treatment and to diminish the risk of arrhythmia.

    "182": "The present review summarizes current aspects on how to perform noninvasive microvolt T-wave alternans (mTWA) testing in clinical practice. The focus is on methodologic issues such as patient-related, or technical aspects, and interpretation of the results. Special attention is given to the different sources of noise that may interfere with mTWA assessment. The role of beta-blocker therapy and its potential effect on mTWA is discussed as well. In the first clinical studies of mTWA, a high rate of indeterminate test results was observed. In this respect, patient-related indeterminacy has been demonstrated to be associated with an increased mortality and such tests are thus regarded as \"abnormal\" whereas technically inadequate tests are classified as indeterminate. Since mTWA evolves over time in patients with structural heart disease, the \"optimal timing\" for mTWA assessment is rather in the chronic phase than in the acute setting of heart disease.",

Decompensation of HF or acute HF were the most frequent causes of hospitalization (in both groups > 50%). The main etiology was coronary artery disease, either alone or together with hypertension (from about 60% in INT patients to about 78% in CARD patients, p = NS). With regard to pharmacotherapy, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were used in 81% of cases (77% CARD and 83% INT; p = 0.05); out of this group, doses were at optimal or larger in 39.3% of patients (38% CARD patients and 39.4% INT patients). Beta-blockers were administered in 31.4% and 19.1% of patients from the CARD and INT groups respectively (p < 0.0001), but optimal dosing was negligible.",

New techniques and materials for early coronary intervention have contributed significantly to reduce early mortality after myocardial infarction. Secondary prevention determines further progress; it combines evidence-based medical treatment as well as lifestyle modifications. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blocker positively affect elevated blood pressure, left ventricular remodeling, and electrical stability. Statins decrease LDL and increase HDL cholesterol. Acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel are indicated for antiplatelet therapy. Lifestyle modifications unite a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, moderate physical activity, weight reduction, and smoking cessation.",

Compared with group I, patients receiving a beta-blocker plus ASA (group II) had a significant decrease in the activity of XO (P<0.005) and the levels of MDA (P<0.005). When vitamin E was incorporated in the treatment, there was highly significant decrease in these oxidative stress parameters compared with groups I and II (P<0.0005 for XO and MDA).
