    "0": "Present evidence from several secondary and primary preventive trials indicates that if antihypertensive treatment is initiated with a beta-blocker, a better preventive effect on total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and atherosclerotic complications can be expected than if diuretics are used as initial therapy. Results from a recent large-scale multicenter international study (MEHP) have shown that a regimen initiating antihypertensive treatment with 100 mg metoprolol once daily is effective, safe, and well-tolerated in elderly hypertensive patients. This might be of particular importance since a steep increase in cardiovascular mortality and other atherosclerotic complications is seen with age.", 
    "1": "The effect of beta-blocking agents on post-myocardial infarction patients with a history of hypertension or elevated blood pressure (BP) at baseline in two prospective placebo-controlled postinfarction studies using beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (the Stockholm Metoprolol Trial and the Norwegian Timolol Study) is discussed. The results of both of these trials indicate that active beta-blockade reduces the incidence of nonfatal reinfarction, although the BP levels were similar in the two treatment groups. The differences in the efficacy of treatment in previous studies of hypertension are discussed. So far, none of the studies has shown a significant difference in mortality when different antihypertensive therapies have been compared in the same study. Some aspects of designing future trials comparing different treatment regimens in hypertension are discussed.", 
    "2": "In patients with ischaemic heart disease, therapeutic options should be selected on the basis of pathophysiological considerations. Classically, whereas calcium channel blockers and nitrates should be used in patients whose symptoms are more likely to result from coronary vasoconstriction, beta-blockers and revascularisation procedures should be considered when coronary flow reserve is severely limited by \"fixed\" atheroma. However, recent studies from our laboratory indicate that in patients with \"mixed\" angina whose symptoms are thought to be at least partially consequent to coronary vasoconstriction superimposed on atheromatous lesions of different severity, beta-blockers can also be effective in preventing episodes of myocardial ischaemia which occur during everyday life. Although most of these episodes are not apparently caused by an excessive increase in cardiac work, their number, severity, and duration are markedly reduced by beta-blocking agents. From these observations it is argued that, in patients with \"mixed\" angina, most ischaemic events are likely to be caused by transient reduction of regional myocardial perfusion, occurring for different levels of cardiac metabolic demand. The higher the latter, the more likely the former will be to precipitate clinical ischaemia.", 
    "3": "Since introduction of modern Coronary Care Units, hospital mortality has been reduced by about 50%. This is most likely due to a number of treatments that today are well established. Those include detection and treatment of serious arrhythmias with antiarrhythmic agents and electrical conversion, and more aggressive early treatment of congestive heart failure, of chest pain, and of atrioventricular (AV) block and bradyarrhythmias. The new goals in early management of suspected acute myocardial infarction must aim at prevention and limitation of ischemic damage. The use of beta-blockers has been widely studied. Data from 27 randomized trials with a total of about 27,000 patients have convincingly shown that early beta-blockade reduces mortality, prevents and limits infarct development and arrhythmias, and reduces infarct complications. Three large trials, the G\u00f6teborg and MIAMI Trials on metoprolol and the ISIS Trial on atenolol, have demonstrated significant beneficial effects and good tolerance. Thrombolytic therapy in patients with signs of acute myocardial infarction, mainly streptokinase, has demonstrated significant reduction of short-term mortality. The large Italian GISSI Trial, including almost 12,000 patients, showed very significant reduction in 21 day mortality by streptokinase, and the earlier treatment started, the better the reduction. Pooling all published studies in the literature also shows the same favorable effects on mortality. Early treatment with thrombolytic therapy might also prevent and limit infarct development and preserve myocardial function. Recent large scale studies have convincingly demonstrated the value of early beta-blockade and of thrombolytic therapy in selected patients with signs of acute myocardial infarction. It seems reasonable to change the management in the acute phase of myocardial infarction based upon recent major clinical trials.", 
    "4": "We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of nifedipine, metoprolol, and their combination in 338 patients whose hospital admission diagnosis was unstable angina and who were not pretreated with a beta-blocker, and of nifedipine in 177 patients who were treated with a beta-blocker. The main outcome event was the recurrence of ischemia or progression to myocardial infarction within 48 h. Trial medication effects are expressed as ratios of event rates relative to placebo, e.g., the ratio for nifedipine is the event rate under nifedipine divided by that under placebo. In addition, 95% confidence intervals are given. In patients not pretreated with a beta-blocker, the event rate ratio for nifedipine was 1.15 (0.83, 1.64), for metoprolol 0.76 (0.49, 1.16), and for the combination 0.80 (0.53, 1.19). In patients already on a beta-blocker, the addition of nifedipine was favorable; i.e., the rate ratio was 0.68 (0.47, 0.97). Equal numbers of patients developed myocardial infarction and reversible ischemia. Most infarctions occurred early, within 6 h of randomization. In patients not already on a beta-blocker, the nifedipine rate ratio for infarction was 1.51 (0.87, 2.74). These results suggest that, in patients not on previous beta-blockade, metoprolol has a beneficial short-term effect on unstable angina, a fixed combination with nifedipine provides no further gain, and nifedipine may be ineffective or counterproductive. On the other hand, the addition of nifedipine to existing beta-blockade when the patient becomes unstable seems beneficial.", 
    "5": "The distribution of metoprolol and atenolol into ischemic and nonischemic myocardium was studied in anesthetized dogs, pigs, and cats. The beta-blockers were administered intravenously after coronary artery occlusion. Metoprolol was found to be significantly more efficiently distributed to the ischemic myocardium than atenolol in all three species. To investigate the functional implications of this difference in tissue distribution, the anti-ischemic effects of the two beta-blockers were studied in the 2-h period following coronary artery occlusion in anesthetized cats, in which heart rate was kept at a constant level. In this model, metoprolol (0.3 mg.kg-1 + 0.15 mg.kg-1.h-1) was found to attenuate or delay the developing ischemic process. This is shown by its significant reduction of (a) the decline of CK activity in ischemic myocardium, (b) the ST elevation in a precordial ECG lead, and (c) the decrease of arterial pressure and cardiac output. In contrast to metoprolol, atenolol (0.3 mg.kg-1 + 0.15 mg.kg-1.h-1) caused no significant anti-ischemic effect in this cat model. The difference in the effectiveness of the two drugs can most probably be explained by their differential distribution in the ischemic heart. Furthermore, the anti-ischemic effect of metoprolol shows that the presence of a beta-blocker in ischemic left ventricular myocardium can favorably affect the early phase of developing infarction.", 
    "6": "The events that convert chronic coronary artery disease to acute myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death are poorly understood. We studied the time of day of onset of nonfatal myocardial infarction (as judged objectively by CK-MB values, n = 703) and sudden cardiac death (as judged by death certificates, n = 2,203) to determine if there was an increased incidence associated with a particular time of day. Both conditions were found to have prominent circadian rhythms with a primary peak in the morning and a secondary peak in the evening. Platelet aggregability, which has been proposed as a component of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, was also found to increase during the morning. These findings suggest a mechanism for myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death and may lead to improved methods of prevention.", 
    "7": "A survey of the literature concerning 20 years' experience of beta-blockade after myocardial infarction indicates that several positive effects are achieved and that these are neither marginal nor transient. Mortality is reduced during the first year from about 10 to 7%. This has been shown for the individual beta-blockers metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol, and also when the data on all beta-blocker trials have been pooled. The effect is further enhanced if therapy continues. Patients at high risk of mortality can be separated fairly accurately from those at low risk. Thus, prophylactic treatment with the sole purpose of reducing mortality can be individualized. Effects on reinfarction are also already present after 1 year and are enhanced during further follow-up. It has not yet been possible, however, to identify those patients in whom this end-point will not be influenced. Furthermore, during extended follow-up, the proportion of asymptomatic patients who are free of side effects increases during treatment with beta-blockade, whereas it decreases during placebo therapy, due mostly to increased numbers of patients suffering from complications such as reinfarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular incidents, arrhythmias, or disturbances in the peripheral circulation. Twenty percent of patients experienced improved fitness when beta-blockade treatment was withdrawn, which balances the beneficial effects. No other drugs have been shown to have comparable beneficial effects. We conclude that the practical implications of the clinical trials indicate that beta-blockade should be continued for at least 3 years after myocardial infarction in patients without severe side effects.", 
    "8": "The antihypertensive effect of transdermal clonidine (TC) vs. oral propranolol (OP) was evaluated in 32 patients with mild essential hypertension (mean BP 150/95 mm Hg). The protocol consisted of a 4-week pretreatment washout period, a 2- to 6-week titration, a 4-week maintenance phase, and a 1-week postwashout phase. BP control (diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg) was achieved in 15 out of 17 transdermal patients, and in 12 out of 14 propranolol subjects. Comparable decreases in systolic/diastolic BP were noted (-19/15 mm Hg for TC vs. -24/13 mm Hg for OP). No rebound symptoms were reported after sudden cessation of the transdermal system during the post-treatment washout. Side effects were recorded in 3 out of 17 TC patients, and in 3 out of 15 OP patients with 1 OP dropout. A mild transient erythematous rash developed in 2 TC and 2 OP (placebo patch) patients. We conclude that the safety and efficacy of TC is comparable to OP for monotherapy in mild hypertensives.", 
    "9": "Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) catecholamines (CA) were made in an attempt to estimate the activity of central CA neurons in essential hypertension (EHT). CSF norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), and dopamine (DA) levels were measured in 12 normotensive (age 36 +/- 3 years; SBP = 116 +/- 4 and DBP = 79 +/- 4 mm Hg) and in 12 EHT (age 41 +/- 2 years; CSF NE levels were twofold higher in EHT (240 +/- 23 pg/ml) than in normotensive subjects (127 +/- 28 pg/ml). Very low EPI and DA levels were observed in both groups of patients. The results suggest that central (spinal?) noradrenergic activity is increased in patients with EHT. In a second study we evaluated the effects of clonidine treatment for 2 weeks (150 micrograms t.i.d.) on CSF NE in EHT. Clonidine reduced pretreatment BP and CSF NE levels by 27% (p less than 0.05) and 39% (p less than 0.01), respectively. The results of the study indicate that central noradrenergic activity is reduced during clonidine treatment. A third group of experiments was designed to compare the effects of clonidine with those of propranolol treatment in patients with EHT. CSF NE measurements were made after 1 month of treatment with 0.36 +/- 0.07 mg of clonidine daily or 160 mg of propranolol daily. CSF NE levels were significantly lower in the clonidine group (p less than 0.01). Seventy-two hours after abrupt discontinuation of clonidine or propranolol treatment, BP returned to pretreatment levels. However, CSF NE showed a threefold increase after clonidine withdrawal, and no change after propranolol withdrawal. CSF EPI was not affected by either treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "To assess the efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol (MET), 200 mg slow release (SR) q.d., and nifedipine (NIF), 20 mg SR b.i.d., 20 mildly to moderately hypertensive outpatients (14 men and 6 women; mean age 41.5 years, range 27-49 years) were studied. After being withdrawn from previous antihypertensive treatments, the patients were given single-blind placebo for 2 weeks and thereafter, in double-blind, randomized sequence, MET and NIF, both for 2 weeks. At the end of each period of the study, blood pressure (BP) was recorded for 24 h using a noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring device (ICR System) with readings taken every 10 min (from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), 15 min (from 6 to 12 p.m.), and 20 min (from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Five patients did not complete the study because of the occurrence of unwanted effects (one patient on MET and four patients on NIF). In the 15 patients who concluded the study both drugs significantly reduced (p less than 0.01), in comparison with placebo, systolic BP (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diastolic BP (DBP) throughout the 24 h (MET: -16.9, -11.5, and -8.9 mm Hg; NIF: -12.7, -8.4, and -6.6 mm Hg, respectively). In comparison with NIF, SBP and MAP but not DBP were significantly reduced by MET (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). We conclude that in our patient population MET was more effective and better tolerated than NIF. A possible explanation could be the relatively young age of the subjects we studied.", 
    "11": "Nitrendipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist suggested to be a new drug for first-line antihypertensive therapy, possibly active in once-daily administration. In the present study the acute and long-term hypotensive effects of nitrendipine have been evaluated in comparison with those of atenolol in a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. Twenty-four patients have been studied, and the effects of treatment have been evaluated both at rest and during psychological and physiological stresses. Hemodynamic noninvasive parameters have also been obtained, at rest and during mental arithmetic tests, by a continuous-wave Doppler technique. Preliminary results about the first 13 consecutive patients are reported here. Nitrendipine induced a highly significant acute hypotensive effect (2 h after drug administration), whereas no effect was observed for atenolol except for heart rate. During chronic treatment (5 weeks), nitrendipine showed less hypotensive effect than atenolol when BP values 24 h after the last administration were analyzed, but significantly more effect when values obtained 2 h after drug administration were evaluated. These findings confirm that nitrendipine is effective in decreasing blood pressure, but the once-daily administration may not bring about the maximum effect in all patients. Interesting aspects of this drug, which make the clinical use of this compound safe, are represented by apparent lack in tolerance and rebound, and by the moderate increase in cardiac output associated with the treatment.", 
    "12": "Ca2+ antagonists may be particularly effective in \"low-renin\" patients, including black subjects and diabetics, as metabolically sound antihypertensive therapy. This paper reports a double-blind randomized crossover trial of verapamil SR (to 240 mg b.i.d.) versus metoprolol (to 100 mg b.i.d.) in 20 black and 15 Caucasian non-insulin-dependent patients with entry blood pressures (BP) greater than 160/90 mm Hg. Mean age was 61 +/- 4.8 years; duration of diabetes 5.8 +/- 4.9 years. Each subject took 4 weeks placebo, then two 6 week active phases, with an intervening 2 week washout. Erect (E)/lying (L) BP, weight, and fasting blood were taken at each visit with overnight urine collections. In blacks mean entry BP (L) +/- SD were 165.8 +/- 16/98.7 +/- 11 mm Hg. On verapamil BP (L) fell significantly by -12.6 +/- 16/-6.6 +/- 9.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), but there was no overall fall on metoprolol (+1.65 +/- 14.5/-1.3 +/- 9.7 mm Hg). Heart rates fell on both drugs from 76.1 +/- 18.3 to 68.4 +/- 11 and 59.4 +/- 7.6 beats/min, respectively, indicating tablet compliance. In whites, BP fell on both drugs, as did heart rates. Changes in HbA1c, plasma glucose, and renin were statistically insignificant. Change in BP was unrelated to initial renin levels in either blacks or whites. In blacks, mean entry urine Na, K, and Ca were 77.4 +/- 39.3, 20.9 +/- 10, and 2.35 +/- 1.5 mmol/l and in whites 84.1 +/- 42, 22 +/- 17.2, and 3.56 +/- 3.2 mmol/l, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Felodipine was compared with prazosin in patients with essential hypertension whose blood pressure was not controlled by a beta-blocking drug. One hundred patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to mm Hg after 4 weeks or more on a beta-blocking drug and placebo were randomly assigned to felodipine or prazosin tablets. The drugs were titrated at 2-week intervals if diastolic BP was greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg. Titration steps of felodipine were 5, 10, 20 mg b.i.d. and of prazosin were 1, 2, 4 mg b.i.d. The fall in blood pressure with felodipine 32/21 mm Hg was greater than the fall with prazosin 16/12 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); 36 patients achieved a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg with felodipine, which was a significantly greater number than the 20 patients who obtained such a level with prazosin (p less than 0.01). Both drugs were well tolerated, but more patients complained of vascular type side effects (flushing, peripheral edema) with felodipine than with prazosin. There was significant weight gain with prazosin but not with felodipine. Felodipine was shown to be a well-tolerated, effective antihypertensive agent when used with a beta-blocking drug and to be suitable for people with hypertension who fail to be controlled with a beta-blocking drug.", 
    "14": "The pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effects of the nifedipine tablet and capsule have been examined in six male patients with diastolic pressure greater than 95 mm Hg despite metoprolol therapy. On two separate mornings, a 20 mg nifedipine tablet or 2 X 10 mg nifedipine capsules were administered with metoprolol 100 mg following a 12-h fast. Both capsule and tablet significantly reduced blood pressure (BP), with the maximum fall occurring at 45 min for the capsule and 4 h for the tablet. Two patients developed postural hypotension after the capsule and a third experienced flushing and palpitations. The maximum nifedipine plasma concentration after the capsule was 257 ng/ml compared with 50 ng/ml for the tablet, and the time of maximum concentration was significantly earlier for the capsule. Although the nifedipine capsule results in a fivefold higher maximum plasma concentration and is associated with a more rapid reduction in blood pressure than the tablet, its use may be limited by postural hypotension and other untoward symptoms.", 
    "15": "From a hemodynamic point of view, the calcium antagonists represent an interesting way of treating hypertension, because they reduce total peripheral resistance without compromising cardiac output. Blood flow is also maintained during muscular exercise. Verapamil and diltiazem induce slight reduction in heart rate, but this is compensated by increase in stroke volume. Verapamil and diltiazem also prolong atrioventricular conduction time, in contrast to the dihydropyridines. Most clinical data are available for verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, these compounds seem as effective as diuretics and beta-blockers. They do not induce disturbances in glucose metabolism, serum uric acid, or serum potassium, and unwanted disturbances in blood lipids have not been described. The dihydropyridines may safely be combined with beta-blockers, but the combination of either verapamil or diltiazem with a beta-blocker should be avoided (because of the high risk of bradycardia). The calcium antagonists seem particularly useful in patients with the combination of hypertension and angina pectoris or peripheral vascular diseases or chronic obstructive lung diseases or diabetes. They are also effective in hypertensive crises. They may also be tried as a first line drug in patients with mild and moderate essential hypertension, particularly when diuretics or beta-blockers are contraindicated. Temporary side effects due to vasodilatation (headache, flushing, and palpitations) are seen frequently, particularly on the dihydropyridines. Edema is the most frequent serious side effect of the dihydropyridines, and constipation is most common with verapamil. At this point, few long-term data are available and it is not known whether the calcium antagonists will give better or worse results, with respect to morbidity and mortality, than the beta-blockers, diuretics, or other more recent antihypertensive agents.", 
    "16": "Calcium antagonists and antihypertensive alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic drugs may cause changes in plasma lipoprotein levels. Different mechanisms by which these antihypertensive agents effect cellular lipid metabolism have been proposed. The activity of lipoprotein lipase that determines the catabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) is decreased by the beta-blocker propranolol and increased by alpha 1-antagonists. The plasma cholesterol or low density lipoprotein (LDL) level is inversely associated with the number of LDL receptors. Catecholamines suppress the LDL receptor activity, thus leading to an increase in plasma cholesterol concentration. The calcium antagonist verapamil and the beta-blocker propranolol may increase LDL receptor activity either per se or by its antagonizing effect on the catecholamine action. The metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) may be affected directly by catecholamines, which might increase HDL binding activity, thereby enhancing efflux of cholesterol from cells. Catecholamines inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in extrahepatic cells. The effects are mediated by alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Accordingly, the alpha 2-agonists clonidine and alpha-methyldopa mimicked and propranolol opposed the catecholamine action. In contrast, the alpha 1 antagonists indoramin, prazosin, and urapidil had no effect on cholesterol synthesis. The results provide evidence that calcium antagonists and various antihypertensive drugs, depending upon their action on beta- or alpha-adrenergic receptors, affect lipid metabolism differently. The metabolic effect may play a role in atherogenesis and may be of clinical importance when antihypertensive treatment is considered.", 
    "17": "Baroreflex control of renin release following acute and prolonged blood pressure reduction by felodipine administration was investigated in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fitted with arterial and venous catheters. Basal values of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and plasma renin activity (PRA) were obtained in SHR and in SHR given felodipine for 2 weeks (SHRF). In SHRFMAP was reduced by 12% (p less than 0.01) versus SHR, but PRA and HR were similar. Acute i.v. infusion of felodipine, during 5 h, maintained MAP reduction by 40%. Initially, HR increased 29 +/- 3% but returned to predrug levels after 3 h. PRA increased from 1.4 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 1.0 ng/ml/h. After 5 h PRA had reached low levels equal to those in SHR given placebo instead of felodipine. In SHR pretreated with metoprolol neither HR nor PRA increased following felodipine, an indication that the observed changes were neurogenically determined. This suggests that baroreflex control of cardiac and renal function resets within 3-5 h following blood pressure reduction by felodipine.", 
    "18": "Our previous studies have shown that blood pressure variability is not linked to activity of the adrenergic nervous system but that a small part of the variation is due to vagal nervous tone. The present work investigates whether myogenic activity of blood vessels could be responsible for the blood pressure variations. To test this hypothesis, variability was measured before and after administration of nifedipine, known to decrease spontaneous vascular contractions. In 17 patients with moderate essential hypertension, blood pressure was measured every 30 min for 12 h with a device recording Korotkoff's sounds on tape. Blood pressure variability was defined as the standard deviation of the mean of all readings. Placebo, nifedipine (20 mg b.i.d. in a slow-release formulation) alone and in combination with atenolol (50 mg b.i.d.), and atenolol alone were given double-blind for 3 weeks each. At the end of each period, a 12 h blood pressure profile was recorded. Systolic blood pressure significantly decreased with any of the drugs used; the combination of nifedipine and atenolol caused a greater decrease than that of any of the drugs alone. Diastolic blood pressure only decreased with the combination of nifedipine and atenolol. Nifedipine did not cause significant changes in systolic or diastolic variability; a small but nonsignificant decrease in diastolic variability was seen with atenolol and the combination of atenolol and nifedipine. The present data do not support the hypothesis that blood pressure variability is linked to myogenic vascular activity because no decrease in blood pressure variability was seen with nifedipine.", 
    "19": "An enhanced hypotensive effect has been observed in short-term studies of the combination of an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist and a calcium channel blocker. This study further evaluates combined treatment with prazosin and verapamil in 12 essential hypertensives who had not responded satisfactorily to standard beta-blocker and thiazide diuretic regimens. After placebo treatment, patients received monotherapy with either prazosin or verapamil. The appropriate second drug was then added, and combination treatment was continued for 4 weeks. A series of 8 h study days was undertaken at the end of each treatment phase to assess blood pressure, heart rate, and pharmacokinetics. Both monotherapies caused significant reductions in blood pressure. For the prazosin group the average blood pressure on monotherapy was 146/81 mm Hg (supine) and 151/88 mm Hg (erect), and for the verapamil group the corresponding figures were 149/81 and 156/92 mm Hg. In both groups significant further reductions in blood pressure were observed during combination treatment: on average, 133/74 mm Hg (supine) and 130/77 mm Hg (erect) for the prazosin group and, respectively, 137/75 and 141/85 mm Hg for the verapamil group. The pharmacokinetics of verapamil were not altered by the coadministration of prazosin, but there were changes in the pharmacokinetics of prazosin, with significant increases in peak plasma concentrations and bioavailability. Prazosin and verapamil form a useful antihypertensive drug combination. The overall effect is partly due to an increase in the apparent bioavailability of prazosin but may also reflect a synergistic effect on reducing peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "20": "Several large-scale studies have recently drawn attention to the fact that arterial hypertension frequently is inadequately controlled and that therapeutic alternatives other than the commonly employed stepped-care treatment may be needed in order to obtain normotension. For this reason PN 200-110, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist--at two different dose levels (average 3.8 mg b.i.d. or 5.7 mg b.i.d.)--or placebo was added in a double-blind cross-over trial to pindolol, 10 mg per day, in 20 patients with essential hypertension, after an initial 3-week placebo period. Ionized calcium in serum was determined repeatedly during the study. From an initial level of 157/100 mm Hg, PN 200-110 at the first dose level reduced blood pressure by 14/11 mm Hg (p less than 0.01/0.001) and at the second dose level reduced blood pressure by 22/18 mm Hg (p less than 0.001/0.001). The reduction in mean arterial pressure was significantly correlated to age (=0.050, p less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in heart rate, nor were there any significant correlations between ionized calcium and the effect of PN 200-110 nor between the changes in ionized calcium and the changes in blood pressure. Adverse effects were few and mild. One patient had to be withdrawn because of side effects, probably not related to the investigated drugs. Thus, addition of PN 200-110 to hypertensive patients treated with pindolol caused highly significant and clinically relevant further reductions in arterial pressure. The results show that a combination of this kind offers the possibility of good blood pressure control.", 
    "21": "The purpose of these studies was to investigate the hemodynamic effects of carvedilol, a compound with combined properties of nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade and precapillary vasodilatation. The acute effects were studied with invasive technique (dye dilution) in 10 patients taking 25 mg orally and noninvasively (forearm plethysmography) in 10 patients taking 25 mg and in 10 patients taking 50 mg orally, all with essential hypertension. Significant reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05-0.001) were observed in all groups. Total peripheral resistance (TPR) did not change acutely whereas resistance in the forearm was reduced by 16% (p less than 0.05; invasive group). When a comparison with propranolol (80 mg x 2) was made in a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in 30 patients, carvedilol acutely reduced blood pressure significantly by 13/6 mg Hg (25 mg) and 17/10 mm Hg (50 mg) in contrast to propranolol. Resistance in the forearm fell significantly with 50 mg carvedilol, whereas propranolol caused a significant rise. After 4 weeks, both compounds had reduced blood pressure significantly. Blood flow was still reduced with propranolol in contrast to the findings with carvedilol. In conclusion, the summary of these studies shows that carvedilol given orally has a useful antihypertensive effect both acutely and during prolonged treatment, and it has an attractive hemodynamic profile, in agreement with the hemodynamic findings in essential hypertension.", 
    "22": "Carvedilol is a recently developed antihypertensive drug that combines in the same molecule a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect and a vasodilating precapillary activity. In our study, we have investigated the effects of carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d. on blood pressure, heart rate, and plasma noradrenaline in hypertensive patients at rest and during exercise after acute and repeated oral administration for 7 days. The daily average supine blood pressure of the 12 patients with essential hypertension was 178 +/- 10/107 +/- 3 mm Hg (means +/- SD of 8 measurements in each patient) after placebo and was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced to 162 +/- 17/99 +/- 8 mm Hg on the first day and to 158 +/- 15/96 +/- 8 mm Hg on the seventh day of carvedilol treatment. Similar values were found in the upright posture. Heart rate was slightly but significantly lowered during acute and repeated administration. The exercise-induced increase in systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced by carvedilol 25 mg b.i.d., while there was a nonsignificant reduction in the tachycardic response. There was a significantly greater rise in plasma noradrenaline during exercise on the seventh day of carvedilol treatment. Carvedilol significantly lowered blood pressure and heart rate at rest and the exercise-induced rise in systolic blood pressure.", 
    "23": "This study in eight elderly male volunteers examined the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol following intravenous and oral administration of the drug. Blood pressure and pulse rate responses were also determined and compared with those to labetalol. Carvedilol was absorbed rapidly after oral administration with a bioavailability of approximately 45% and obeyed linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 25-50 mg. The terminal elimination half-life varied between 5 and 14 h. Administration of the drug with food did not alter the bioavailability or kinetic handling of carvedilol. The hemodynamic responses to carvedilol followed the same pattern as those to labetalol. There was a rapid dose-related fall in blood pressure maximal after 4-5 h and disappearing by 12 hours. Tachycardia that was evident on placebo was inhibited by both drugs. Postural hypotension and dizziness were also apparent with both drugs.", 
    "24": "Pharmacokinetics of carvedilol (C) have been studied in healthy volunteers after a single i.v. and oral administration, and the metabolic disposition after oral administration of 14C-labeled drug. C demonstrates dose-linear behavior. The absolute bioavailability reaches 24% probably due to a first-pass effect. After a 50 mg oral dose, maximum concentrations of 66 micrograms/l are achieved within 1.2 h. C is extensively distributed to the tissues (Vz = 132 l) and eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism (total clearance 590 ml/min, renal clearance 4 ml/min). Because of the longer half-life of 6.4 h after oral administration in contrast to 2.4 h after i.v. administration, C is assumed to be absorption dependent since no sustained-release formulation was used. The half-life of radioactivity in plasma is 39 h; 16% of C is excreted in urine in the form of metabolites and only 0.3% unchanged. The urinary metabolites consist of carvedilol glucuronide (5.2% of the dose), cleavage products of the beta-blocking side chain (2.1%), and ring-hydroxylated forms (2.9%). Sixty percent of the dose is recovered in the feces. A demethylated product of C exhibits only minor beta-blocking activity. This metabolite is detected in plasma in concentrations ten times lower than the parent compound.", 
    "25": "In a single blind parallel design, saline (n = 9), labetalol i.v. (40 mg n = 4, 80 mg n = 3), and carvedilol i.v. (15 mg n = 8) were given to volunteers with blood pressure (BP) recorded intraarterially. The effect of these treatments on the response to challenge doses of angiotensin II (to give a rise in mean BP of 20-25 mm Hg), isoproterenol (to give an increase in heart rate of 30-35 beats/min), and phenylephrine (to give a rise in mean BP of 20-25 mm Hg) were studied. The dose of i.v. carvedilol employed gave a greater fall in BP than the dose of labetalol used. Carvedilol appeared to be about four times more potent than labetalol in inhibiting the tachycardia to isoprenaline. Likewise, from inhibition of the pressor response to phenylephrine, it is concluded that carvedilol is four times more effective at the alpha receptor than labetalol. Neither drug was found to antagonize the pressor effects of angiotensin. Calculation of the half-life of carvedilol gave values of 2.2 to 9 h. The volume of distribution was found to be 1.54 l/kg and the total body clearance was 0.521 l/h/kg.", 
    "26": "The effects of three different nonselective beta-blockers on central and peripheral hemodynamics as well as on pulmonary function were compared in 13 healthy subjects (19-37 years). The subjects were given carvedilol 50 mg, pindolol 10 mg, propranolol 80 mg, and placebo orally twice daily for 1 week in a double-blind, crossover, randomized manner. Heart rate, blood pressure, arterial calf blood flow (venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography), and pulmonary function (flow-volume spirometry) were measured at the first and at the last trial day. Heart rate and blood pressure were lower on carvedilol and propranolol than on pindolol and placebo; the maximal bradycardiac effect was 13 and 17 beats/min and hypotensive effect 9/10 mm Hg and 10/7 mm Hg on carvedilol and propranolol, respectively. Both carvedilol and pindolol increased arterial flow by about 40% (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) and reduced peripheral resistance by about 34% (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively), the effect persisting after 1 week of treatment. None of the medications had any noteworthy effects on pulmonary function. Two subjects complained of tremor on pindolol. We conclude that carvedilol and pindolol possess distinct vasodilatory properties. Carvedilol had a stronger hypotensive effect than pindolol and was well tolerated.", 
    "27": "Single doses, in log steps, of carvedilol from 12.5 to 200 mg, propranolol 40 to 320 mg, pindolol 2.5 to 20 mg, labetalol 50 to 400 mg, and placebo control were given randomised double blind to six healthy volunteers. Noninvasive measurements of blood pressure and heart rate were made supine, standing, and during cycle exercise 1 and 2 h postdose. All drugs produced a dose-dependent reduction in exercise heart rate, but this was greater for propranolol and pindolol than for carvedilol and labetalol at the dose studied. Exercise systolic blood pressure was similarly reduced but there was less separation in the dose response curves between the various drugs. Supine and standing heart rate was reduced only by propranolol, but supine systolic blood pressure was reduced by carvedilol (50, 100, and 200 mg), propranolol (40, 160, and 320 mg), pindolol (5, 10, and 20 mg), and labetalol (400 mg). Standing systolic blood pressure was reduced by carvedilol (50, 100, and 200 mg) and pindolol (2.5 and 20 mg). The effects of carvedilol on resting blood pressure suggest additional blood pressure lowering properties other than the pure beta-antagonism of propranolol. Effects on exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure were similar to carvedilol (12.5-200 mg) with labetalol (50-400 mg), but changes in resting systolic blood pressure were less consistent with labetalol.", 
    "28": "The novel compound BW A575C, N-(1-(S)-carboxy-5-[4-(3-isopropylamino-2-(R,S)-hydroxypropoxy)-indole-2 - carboxamido]pentyl)-(R,S)-alanyl-(S)-proline, is a potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and beta-blocker in vitro. It was therefore of considerable interest to establish whether this novel pharmacological profile was maintained in vivo. In conscious instrumented normotensive rats and dogs, intravenous and oral administration of BW A575C causes a dose-dependent rightward displacement of the pressor dose-response curve to angiotensin I (dose ratio of 29.5 and 16.1 in rats and dogs, respectively, at 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) and the tachycardia dose-response curve to isoprenaline (dose ratio of 3.1 and 8.0 in rats and dogs, respectively, at 1.0 mg/kg i.v.). In these experiments BW A575C is approximately 2-10 times more active as an ACE inhibitor than as a beta-blocker. In conscious instrumented acute renovascular hypertensive dogs, where plasma renin activity is elevated 10-fold, BW A575C (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) causes a reduction in blood pressure of 35% within 10 min of injection, which is sustained for up to 4 h. This reduction in blood pressure is accompanied by a consistent, but nonsignificant, reduction in heart rate. These results confirm the novel pharmacological profile of BW A575C in vivo and demonstrate that this compound is an effective antihypertensive agent in a renin-dependent model of hypertension.", 
    "29": "There are several first choices for mild and moderate hypertension. The selection of a drug may of course be influenced by concomitant pathology, with positive indications for particular drugs: for coexistent angina, a beta-receptor blocking drug or a calcium antagonist; for fluid retention, a diuretic; or for contraindications, e.g., asthma, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. There are therefore several possible first choices: beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, a combined alpha/vasodilator beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, the vasodilators (i.e., drugs acting primarily to reduce peripheral resistance), the calcium antagonists, alpha 1-blocking drugs, and, more recently, the possibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Diuretics are also possible first choice agents, although not quite so frequently as once was the case. The majority of cases of hypertension can usually be controlled by one drug, even if not the first agent chosen. More severe cases may require drugs from two of the three major groups: beta-blocking drugs, vasodilators, and diuretics are often required, and, in some cases, drugs from each group. Drugs such as methyldopa, clonidine, and the adrenergic neuron inhibitory drugs are now more used as reserve agents.", 
    "30": "The present study examined the actions of dilevalol, an antihypertensive beta-adrenoceptor blocker with arterial vasodilator actions, upon aortic compliance (AC) in anesthetized dogs. AC was determined via sonomicrometric determination of the ratio of aortic systolic-diastolic diameters (mm) and arterial pulse pressure (mm Hg). One AC unit (ACU) equals 10(-3) mm/mm Hg. Dilevalol (0.032, 0.1, and 3.2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly (p less than 0.05) increased AC by 1.4 +/- 0.3, 3.7 +/- 1.4, and 4.5 +/- 1.2 ACU, respectively, from basal values of 4.7 +/- 0.4-5.6 +/- 0.4 ACU, while reducing blood pressure by 20 +/- 2, 31 +/- 9, and 41 +/- 10 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05). Increases in AC were not the passive result of altered blood pressure. Proximal mechanical aortic occlusion dropped systolic blood pressure as much as 70 mm Hg without altering AC. Propranolol (0.32 and 1.0 mg/kg) did not significantly change AC, but propranolol pretreatment attentuated dilevalol-induced increases in AC. Pindolol (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) lowered blood pressure 17 +/- 3 (p less than 0.05) to 34 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), while significantly increasing AC by 1.2 +/- .2 to 2.7 +/- .7 ACU. The data show that dilevalol, unlike propranolol, increases AC substantially at antihypertensive doses. The inhibition of dilevalol-induced AC increases by propranolol illustrates a beta-adrenoceptor agonist activity in large arteries. Since large artery compliance is impaired in hypertension, dilevalol may afford a vasular protective action for known risk factors for evolving systemic arterial disease.", 
    "31": "The purpose of this study was to examine the antihypertensive effect of carvedilol and the possible mode of its action. After single oral administration, carvedilol (3-30 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate in conscious hypertensive models: spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR), renal hypertensive rats (one kidney, one clip), and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/salt rats. Repeated administration of carvedilol (10 mg/kg, p.o., once daily for 5 days) caused a fall in SBP and bradycardia in SHR. The development of tolerance and the rebound phenomenon of SBP were not seen. In anesthetized SHR, the hypotensive response to carvedilol (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.), unlike that to propranolol, was accompanied by a significant reduction of total peripheral resistance. A tendency toward a decrease in plasma renin activity was observed after oral carvedilol in SHR. The hypotensive effect was not attenuated by the pretreatment of SHR with indomethacin. Further, carvedilol did not cause appreciable changes in the production of 6-ketoprostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha in the aortic rings of SHR. In anesthetized cats, carvedilol (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a significant decrease in blood pressure but the same dose in the cerebral ventricle caused no detectable fall in blood pressure. The significant fall in blood pressure was observed in both intact and debuffered cats. These results suggest that carvedilol may possess a broad hypotensive spectrum against various types of experimental hypertension, and that the endogenous PG system and the central cardiovascular control system may not be responsible for the antihypertensive effect of carvedilol.", 
    "32": "Postural hypotension is a common side effect observed in the treatment of hypertension with various drugs. Carvedilol, a vasodilating beta-blocker, was compared with prazosin, labetalol, and guanethidine for its ability to induce orthostatic hypotension. The comparison was carried out using doses of the drugs required to lower baroreceptor reflex hypertension in anesthetized rabbits by 30 mm Hg (ED -30 mm Hg). The following doses were found in independent investigations to be equipotent in this rabbit model: ED -30 mm Hg (mg/kg i.v.): prazosin = 0.03; labetalol = 1.8; guanethidine = 0.12; carvedilol = 0.12. These doses did not markedly inhibit the orthostatic reaction in rabbits after tilting stress, so 10-fold higher doses were used and clear discrimination between the drugs was found. The orthostatic index was reduced after prazosin and labetalol by about 24%, after guanethidine by about 30%, and after carvedilol by about 13%. The 50-fold dose of carvedilol (6 mg/kg i.v.) does not lead to any greater inhibition of the orthostatic index. From these results it is concluded that a relatively lower risk of postural hypotension is to be expected after carvedilol treatment than with the other drugs presented here. Furthermore, these results do not provide any indication that carvedilol exerts its vasodilator properties via alpha-blockade.", 
    "33": "Investigations were performed on isolated rat aortic strips and in pithed rats in order to elucidate the mechanism of vasorelaxation or the acute blood pressure lowering effect induced by carvedilol. In particular, the possible role of the beta-receptor-stimulating activities or alpha-blocking properties has been investigated. beta 2-stimulation can be ruled out, since preincubation of isolated vessels with the beta 2-receptor blocker ICI 118.551 does not influence the vasorelaxing activity of carvedilol. Additionally, its optical enantiomers also induce the same vasorelaxing effect in vitro. In contrast to the standard alpha-blocking agents phentolamine or prazosin, carvedilol does not inhibit effects of alpha-receptor agonists at hypotensive doses, but inhibition of the effects of alpha-receptor agonists has been found in vitro and in vivo at high concentrations or doses and indicates a potential alpha-blocking activity of carvedilol. For example, the dose required for a specific inhibitory effect on norepinephrine responses observed in pithed rats is at least 20 times higher than that required for a decrease in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Furthermore, the alpha-blocking activity is at least 20 times lower than the beta-blocking activity, whereas hypotension and beta-blockade can be observed in intact animals after acute administration in the same dose range of carvedilol. It can therefore be assumed that the alpha-blocking activity does not contribute substantially to the decrease in blood pressure at doses normally used. It is suggested that a not yet defined postreceptor mechanism is involved in the vasorelaxing and acute blood pressure lowering activity of carvedilol.", 
    "34": "We found compounds in the class of \"phenoxyethylamines\" that in addition to a beta-blocking activity also showed vasodilatation. Using screening investigations in rabbits, substances were sought that possess both properties in the same dose or concentration range. These conditions were fulfilled, for example, by carvedilol. In further, more detailed, pharmacological investigations it was found that the substances are also active after oral administration. The cause of the hypotensive action of carvedilol is a fall in total peripheral vascular resistance resulting from a direct vasodilating action. This direct vasodilating action is demonstrable in aortic strips independently of whether the preparation has been previously contracted with noradrenaline, potassium chloride, or a thromboxane agonist. Carvedilol behaves in this respect more like glyceryl trinitrate and less like the alpha 1-blocker prazosin. Because of the additional beta-blocking action, there is only a slight activation of reflex mechanisms even at clearly hypotensive doses in comparison with equipotent doses of other vasodilators (dihydralazine and nicardipine). With respect to its beta-blocking action, carvedilol is very similar to propranolol. It does not have any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or any cardioselectivity, and its membrane-stabilizing property is approximately the same as that of propranolol. The balanced ratio of the vasodilatation and beta-blocking actions makes this substance an interesting choice for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "35": "Carvedilol is a new substance displaying beta-sympatholytic and vasodilating activities in the same dose range. Data obtained from a considerable number of animal experiments show that the beta-blocking properties of carvedilol resemble those of propranolol. However, in contrast to propranolol the arterial blood pressure decreases dose dependently after single doses of carvedilol due to a reduced total peripheral resistance. The vasodilating activity of carvedilol can be demonstrated in a variety of experimental models. According to the present state of knowledge neither alpha-blockade, nor Ca antagonism, serotonin antagonism, prostaglandin-mediated vasorelaxation, or endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)-dependent activity are responsible for the antihypertensive effect. Thus, although the mechanism of vasodilation has still not been completely clarified, a postreceptor mechanism seems likely. The acute vasodilating properties in humans have been shown as a dose-dependent increase of the finger pulse amplitude in healthy subjects after both intravenous and oral administration, and as a decrease of the regional resistances and an increase of regional blood flow. The pharmacokinetics of carvedilol are dose linear and peak concentrations are reached within 1-1.5 h after oral administration. The elimination half-life after single oral doses varies from 6-7 h. The renal clearance of 4 ml/min is negligible in comparison with the total body clearance of 590 ml/min. Therefore, the absolute bioavailability of 24% indicates some degree of first-pass extraction. The highly lipophilic drug is extensively distributed to the tissues, as shown by the distribution volume of 132 l. In patients with hypertension, single doses of carvedilol (25-50 mg) decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure for more than 10 h, whereas heart rate is only slightly decreased. In hypertensive patients treated from 7 days up to 1 year, carvedilol proved to be an effective and safe antihypertensive drug. In contrast to conventional beta-blockers, the reduced vascular resistance, in particular of the renal circulation, observed after both acute and chronic administration of carvedilol, indicated the useful hemodynamic profile of this compound. In addition, patients not sufficiently controlled with conventional beta-blockers responded promptly to carvedilol. At the same time left ventricular performance is not depressed. In a 1-year open clinical trial with hypertensives WHO I and II, the responder rate was about 85% with carvedilol as monotherapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "36": "In the treatment of hypertension, drugs with different mechanisms of action are frequently combined. The rationale for this procedure is that lowering blood pressure via one mechanism often leads to the activating of processes that tend to increase blood pressure. Thus, during antihypertensive treatment with vasodilating agents, reflex stimulation of the heart occurs with increase of cardiac output. By this, the blood pressure lowering effect of the vasodilator is antagonized. Combination of several drugs may complicate therapy because of differences in the onset and the duration of action. Sometimes, there are pharmacokinetic drug interactions. By combining several blood pressure lowering mechanisms in one drug molecule, one tries to prevent these difficulties. There are now several drugs with a dual mode of action available for the treatment of hypertension. Labetalol combines alpha- and beta-receptor blocking activities. Meanwhile, there is ample experience with the use of this drug in the treatment of hypertensive patients. Labetalol can be used for acute decrease of blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies. Most often, the drug is given for chronic treatment of hypertension. The overall incidence of side effects from labetalol compares favorably with that from other drugs. In addition to side effects caused by beta-blockade, the use of labetalol may result in postural hypotension due to the alpha-receptor blocking activity. Carvedilol is a new compound that combines beta-receptor blockade and vasodilation in one molecule. The drug can be used to acutely and chronically reduce blood pressure. Carvedilol is now undergoing clinical investigation. The same is true for celiprolol, a beta 1-receptor blocking agent with alpha 2-receptor blocking activity.", 
    "37": "In a randomized double-blind study, oral doses of 50 mg carvedilol were compared to 40 mg propranolol in 16 male patients with coronary heart disease (12 without significant stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) at rest, during and after exercise, and before and 80 min after drug application. Systemic and pulmonary pressures, heart rate, cardiac index, and lower limb blood flow were measured, and systemic and pulmonary resistances calculated. Carvedilol does not lead, as the classical beta-blocker propranolol does, to an increase in systemic or pulmonary resistance, nor to a decrease in cardiac output, or to an increase of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise. In contrast to propranolol, the postexercise lower limb blood flow has increased significantly. The differences in action between the two beta-blockers can be explained by the vasodilating properties of carvedilol. Due to these acute effects, carvedilol may be of advantage compared to propranolol in the treatment of peripheral occlusive artery disease, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm.", 
    "38": "To evaluate the antianginal efficacy of carvedilol, a beta-blocker with vasodilating activity, we performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of two single doses of carvedilol. Twelve patients (eight males, four females, mean age 57 years) with stable effort angina and a positive exercise ECG with angina underwent treadmill exercise testing 2 h after either placebo, or carvedilol 25 or 50 mg. Both doses of carvedilol reduced resting heart rate but only the 50 mg dose reduced resting blood pressure. Exercise time and time to angina increased by 24% and 35%, respectively, after carvedilol, and ST depression at both maximal and submaximal work levels was reduced. The time to 1 mm ST depression was increased by carvedilol but the heart rate at 1 mm ST depression and maximum ST/heart rate slope were unchanged. Maximum heart rate, systolic pressure, and rate-pressure product were significantly reduced by carvedilol. The 50 mg dose was significantly better than 25 mg in prolonging exercise time and reducing subjective and objective measurements of ischemia, and this was related to significantly greater hemodynamic effects. Carvedilol appears to be effective in preventing or reducing effort angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen demand, and it exhibits an important dose-response effect.", 
    "39": "The exercise response to a single oral dose (25 mg) of a new beta-blocking agent that also has potent vasodilating properties, carvedilol, was assessed in 15 patients with stable exertional angina, positive exercise tests (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression) and coronary artery disease. A placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study was carried out. Compared with placebo, carvedilol significantly reduced both resting heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) at rest. After the administration of carvedilol, 10 of the 15 patients did not have angina at peak exercise and 5 had ST shifts less than 1 mm. Total exercise time and time to 1 mm ST depression were prolonged, and ST segment depression at peak exercise was significantly reduced. Systolic BP was reduced both at peak exercise and at 1 mm ST depression whereas mean HR at peak exercise did not change significantly compared with placebo. Overall, mean HR-BP product at peak exercise was significantly reduced by carvedilol compared with placebo. However, four patients achieved similar or higher HR-BP product and yet did not experience angina and had less ST depression (or no ST segment shifts) during exercise. This indicates an increase in their coronary flow reserve. These results suggest that carvedilol is effective therapy for effort-induced angina, and this may be related to its combined beta-blocking and vasodilatory properties.", 
    "40": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was set up to study the effects of acute and chronic administration of carvedilol, a vasodilatory beta-blocker in essential hypertension. Acute administration of a single dose of 50 mg of carvedilol reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, without inducing reflex tachycardia. Renal blood flow was preserved; accordingly renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced. A significant reduction of glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction was observed. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone were not changed. Chronic carvedilol treatment produced a significant fall in systolic and diastolic office and ambulatory blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, PRA and plasma aldosterone. Blood pressure variability was not changed. Renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction also remained unchanged; renal vascular resistance decreased significantly. It is concluded that carvedilol possesses definite antihypertensive and renal vasodilating properties, both acutely and after chronic treatment.", 
    "41": "Carvedilol and metoprolol were given for 4 weeks in a double-blind study to patients with essential hypertension. The effects on blood pressure were measured and hemodynamic alterations were assessed by forearm venous plethysmography before and after chronic administration, and 2 h after an acute dose before and during chronic therapy. Carvedilol (50 mg/day) reduced supine and erect blood pressure, and pulse rate similar to the reduction with metoprolol (100 mg b.i.d.). There was a tendency for forearm blood flow to rise and for forearm resistance to fall with both drugs. When administered acutely, there was no fall in pulse rate with carvedilol compared to the fall with metoprolol when on placebo or active therapy. The blood pressure fall with acute administration was similar with both drugs when not on treatment, but when on chronic therapy, there was no fall with metoprolol but a marked fall with carvedilol. In this circumstance, vascular resistance rose with metoprolol but not with carvedilol. No effect of either drug on a modified cold presser test was observed. Both drugs were well tolerated and there were no significant side effects except for an excessive fall in blood pressure in one patient on carvedilol. Plasma renin activity (PRA) fell with both drugs and there was a tendency for both plasma potassium and plasma uric acid to rise. Carvedilol was well tolerated and reduced blood pressure successfully.", 
    "42": "Carvedilol (BM 14190) is a new potent and well-tolerated beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilating properties. Acute clinical studies have confirmed its efficacy as an antihypertensive agent. The present double-blind, randomized, metoprolol-controlled, long-term study reports the therapeutic results of carvedilol in essential hypertensive patients. Compared with placebo, carvedilol significantly reduces blood pressure after oral administration of 50 mg on a single and twice daily regimen. The antihypertensive effect was acute in onset, comparable in supine and standing position, and exercise-induced hypertension and tachycardia were significantly reduced. Indirect automatic 24 h blood pressure monitoring reliably confirmed clinic blood pressure and demonstrated a good antihypertensive effect of carvedilol after a single oral administration throughout daily activities and sleeping periods.", 
    "43": "Twenty-four hour profiles of intraarterial ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were significantly reduced by administration of carvedilol, a new beta-blocker with vasodilating properties. Twelve patients were given carvedilol, 25 mg twice daily for 2 weeks; the dose was then increased to 50 mg twice daily if the target BP was not achieved. After 4 weeks of therapy, mean daytime reduction in BP was 25 +/- 3 mm Hg systolic and 19 +/- 3 mm Hg diastolic, and mean reduction in heart rate was 22 +/- 3 beats/min. BP at the peak of isometric exercise and during dynamic exercise was also significantly reduced. Radionuclide measurements showed that left ventricular ejection fraction was not affected by treatment, but there was a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic volumes. The drug was well tolerated. This clinical trial suggests that carvedilol will be a useful first-line drug for treatment of essential hypertension, and its vasodilating action may have a more favorable effect on left ventricular function than conventional beta-blocking drugs.", 
    "44": "The effect of once daily low-dose carvedilol on circadian variations of blood pressure (BP) was studied in Japanese patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Thirty-one patients were admitted to hospital whose BP was 150/90 mm Hg/day or greater and they participated in the study. After a placebo period of 1 week, 5 or 10 mg carvedilol was given once daily in the morning for 3 to 7 days, and if BP reduction was not sufficient, the dose was increased to 20 mg daily. The blood pressure variation was monitored before and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after administration of the drug on the last day of placebo and final dose of carvedilol. Of the 31 cases receiving carvedilol once daily, cumulative effectiveness (13 mm Hg reduction in mean BP) was 48.4% at 10 mg/day and 54.8% at 20 mg/day. Both systolic and diastolic pressures decreased significantly and heart rate decreased slightly. There was no significant difference between the standard deviations of BP on the last days of the control period and the carvedilol treatment. The difference between maximum and minimum BP during the day was not significant between the two periods. Circadian variations of heart rate were also not significantly different for the two periods. This indicates that carvedilol did not have any effect on circadian variations of BP and heart rate. The present study also suggests that low-dose carvedilol once daily may be effective in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "45": "In an open clinical study, long-term efficacy and safety of carvedilol were investigated in 154 patients with essential hypertension WHO I-II and diastolic blood pressure (BP) between 95 and 115 mm Hg over a period of 1 year. After a washout and a placebo phase, all patients were treated with 25 mg carvedilol b.i.d., after 4 weeks of an adaption to 25 mg o.d. or 50 mg b.i.d. was possible. Eighty-six patients had been treated according to the protocol (5 patients 25 mg o.d., 77 patients 25 mg b.i.d., and 4 patients 50 mg b.i.d.) An additional 18 patients were included to the final evaluation in spite of the fact that they had incorrect placebo phases. Ten patients had to be excluded from the final evaluation because of protocol violation. Eight patients dropped out because they were nonresponders, 8 patients dropped out because of side effects, and 15 patients dropped out because of other reasons. In all patients treated over the period of 1 year, 99 patients had a diastolic BP less than or equal to 95 and 88 of the less than or equal to 90 mm Hg. The side effects were mostly correlated to the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug; there were no serious side effects during the trial.", 
    "46": "Spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes of newborn rats were exposed in culture to the gamma globulin fraction from the blood serum of patients with allergic asthma and dilated cardiomyopathy. The gamma globulin fraction of the asthmatics inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion the positive chronotropic response of lactate or pyruvate-treated myocytes to clenbuterol, an adrenergic agonist that acted via stimulation of beta 2 adrenoceptors. The gamma globulin fraction of the cardiomyopathic patients increased the rate of beating. This effect was stereoselectively inhibited by the beta blocker (-)-propranolol, indicating an involvement of beta adrenoceptors. The serum gamma globulin fraction from healthy persons had no effect on the beating rate. The effects of both the asthmatic and cardiomyopathic gamma globulin fractions were abolished by immunoprecipitation with antihuman gamma globulin and antihuman IgG. The chronotropic effects of the gamma globulin fraction may be attributed to the presence of autoantibodies to beta-adrenergic receptors, more specifically beta 2 receptors in the case of the asthmatics and beta 1 receptors in the case of the cardiomyopathic patients.", 
    "47": "Basing on the results of the European and Austrian survey on the management of hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease the theoretical backgrounds of the combination of thyrostatic treatment with thyroid hormones and with beta blocking agents are discussed. A suspected lack of compliance of a hyperthyroid patient is probably the only strong argument for the use of combination therapy with thyroid hormones. Some countries in Europe prefer this way of treatment, whereas other countries decline it. In Austria the opinion of the necessity of thyroid hormones in thyrostatic treatment is also not unanimous, the majority, however, preferring it. In contrast, the supporting use of beta blocking agents especially in highly symptomatic patients stands beyond debate. However, monotherapy with beta blockers for preparation of subtotal thyroidectomy in hyperthyroid patients is generally declined, probably because of the danger of a postoperative thyrotoxic crisis. Most colleagues agree (as well in Europe as in Austria) that the combination of thyrostatic drugs with beta-blockers is the best choice for the preparation of subtotal thyroidectomy, saving time and thereby costs and reducing the danger of a postoperative thyrotoxic crisis.", 
    "48": "The available data on the adrenergic influences on lipoprotein metabolism are reviewed. It is clear that the influences are complex. It appears that adrenergic stimuli act at multiple sites in the lipoprotein metabolic pathways. This explains in part, the confusion in interpreting the literature. Based on the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocker administration in animals and humans, it is clear that the net effect of alpha 1-receptor stimulation is a decrease in HDL cholesterol and an increase in LDL cholesterol and VLDL triglyceride. On the other hand, beta-receptor stimulation will result in a net reduction of LDL and an increase in HDL. Further studies to elucidate the exact mechanism of action by the adrenergic stimuli on lipoprotein metabolism should provide insights into the relationship between the adrenergic nervous system and atherosclerosis and an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms by which antihypertensive-adrenergic mechanisms--alpha 1-Inhibition--Atherosclerosis--Serum lipids.", 
    "49": "The effects of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor inhibition with doxazosin, and beta-blockade with propranolol on tissue lipoprotein lipases and plasma lipids were studied in rats. In rats fed a normal lab chow, doxazosin increased heart lipoprotein lipase activity (+14%), while propranolol had the opposite effect (-20%). These effects were not statistically significant when compared with nontreated controls, although the difference between the doxazosin and propranolol groups was significant (p less than 0.05). There were no significant effects on adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity or hepatic lipase activity. In rats fed a cholesterol-enriched diet there were similar but smaller effects on heart lipoprotein lipase activity (+5% and -12%, respectively). In these rats alpha 1-inhibition also tended to increase adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase (+14%) and hepatic lipase (+13%), while beta-blockade had the opposite effect (-20% and -9%, respectively). The lipase activities were significantly different between the treatment groups in liver and heart but not in adipose tissue. Doxazosin and propranolol did not affect plasma triglyceride or total cholesterol, but high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased during alpha 1-blockade (+24%).", 
    "50": "Vascular reactivity is altered by hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Animal studies have shown that serotonergic mechanisms of vasoconstriction are enhanced, while the changes with adrenergic mechanisms are still equivocal. Serum lipids are increased with beta-blocker and diuretic therapy for hypertension. Thus, the increase in serum lipids may be responsible for both structural and functional abnormalities of the vascular system in hypertensive patients. In contrast, recent reports have suggested that alpha 1-adrenergic receptor inhibition, useful in hypertension therapy, may exert a beneficial effect on plasma lipids. We have also collected preliminary data in our laboratory examining the effects of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor inhibition with prazosin on plasma cholesterol levels and vascular reactivity in monkeys with hypercholesterolemia. We observed large reductions in both total cholesterol and the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) + low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction of cholesterol in these animals during treatment with prazosin. Thus, in addition to its sympatholytic action on the vasculature, alpha 1-adrenergic receptor inhibition appears to exert a beneficial effect in reducing total cholesterol levels.", 
    "51": "Effects of intracoronary administration of verapamil (VER), nitroglycerin (TNG), propranolol (PRO), and nicorandil (NIC) on regional hypoxia were examined in 39 open-chest dogs. Distal left anterior descending coronary artery was perfused for 5 min with deoxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution (KHS) in group 1 (n = 9), VER-containing (1.3 mg/dl) KHS in group 2 (n = 9), TNG-containing (0.5 mg/dl) KHS in group 3 (n = 7), PRO-containing (0.4 or 0.8 mg/dl) KHS in group 4 (n = 7), and NIC-containing (0.5 or 2.5 mg/dl) KHS in group 5 (n = 7). Transmural biopsy at 5 min revealed a less severe metabolic deterioration in the hypoxic myocardium in groups 2, 4, and 5, as evidenced by higher ATP content (2.99 +/- 0.73, 2.81 +/- 0.35, and 3.14 +/- 1.20 mumol/g in groups 2, 4, and 5, respectively) and lower lactate accumulation (5.16 +/- 0.59, 5.62 +/- 1.44, and 5.05 +/- 1.12 mumol/g in groups 2, 4, and 5, respectively) compared with those in group 1 (2.09 +/- 0.45 mumol/g in ATP and 8.77 +/- 2.34 mumol/g in lactate). Metabolic preservation by VER, PRO, and NIC were not mediated by changes in hemodynamics and regional myocardial contraction. On the other hand, any significant protective effects were not noted in group 3, despite a significant reduction in rate-pressure products. Under an aerobic condition these agents affected regional myocardial contraction in a different manner from each other.", 
    "52": "The effects of nicorandil and other antianginal drugs on the pH of ischemic myocardium were examined in dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital. The myocardial pH was measured with a micro glass pH electrode placed in the inner layers of the area of myocardium perfused by the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). The myocardium (LAD area) was made ischemic by partially occluding the LAD so that only about one-third of the normal blood flow was allowed to perfuse the tissue. The period of LAD occlusion was 90 min. By 30 min, the partial occlusion had produced a decrease in myocardial pH (about 0.5 U) which lasted until the end of occlusion. The acidosis in the myocardium induced by LAD partial occlusion was metabolic acidosis. The experimental drugs were injected intravenously 30 min after the LAD was occluded. Nicorandil (50 micrograms/kg), nitroglycerin (20 micrograms/kg), and diltiazem (100 micrograms/kg) moderately restored the myocardial H+ concentrations induced by LAD occlusion; propranolol (1 mg/kg) and sotalol (5 mg/kg) markedly restored these concentrations. It was concluded that all five experimental drugs improved ischemic myocardium; nicorandil, nitroglycerin, and diltiazem only moderately counteracted the increased myocardial H+ concentrations produced by LAD occlusion, whereas propranolol and sotalol markedly returned myocardial pH close to normal levels.",

Coronary sinus flow (CSF) was measured using a continuous thermodilution method. NC decreased arterial pressure, cardiac output (CO), and pulmonary artery pressure without changing heart rate. Rate-pressure product tended to decrease. Resting CSF was increased by NC (117-148 ml/min, p less than 0.01) and NF. TNG and PR caused no significant changes. Furthermore, NC revealed the highest CSF/CO ratio among four agents and decreased coronary resistance. During rapid atrial pacing, CSF was slightly increased by TNG, but remained unchanged after NC and NF. Myocardial norepinephrine release was markedly increased by TNG (1.5-6.2 ng/min, p less than 0.01) and slightly increased by NF. No changes were noted after NC and PR. Myocardial lactate extraction varied insignificantly in all agents. NC is a potent coronary vasodilator and seems to reduce both preload and afterload; however, in contrast to TNG and NF, NC did not cause reflex tachycardia or an increase of myocardial sympathetic tone.", 
    "54": "The time course for the decrease in norepinephrine concentration of rat pineal explants in culture indicated a significant fall starting at the 4th hour and completed after 16-24 h of incubation. Significant decreases of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (HIAA) levels in tissue, an increase of HIAA/serotonin ratio, and an increase of melatonin production rate in vitro were also observed as a function of the incubation time. Estradiol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) increased rat pineal melatonin content, testosterone (10(-5) M) decreased it and progesterone was devoid of activity when incubated with explants for up to 6 h. The in vitro stimulatory effect of estradiol on rat pineal methoxyindole synthesis was blocked by propranolol but not by phentolamine; propranolol also blocked the increase of nuclear estradiol-receptor complex produced by estrogen exposure of pineal explants. TSH (1-100 ng/ml), growth hormone (10-100 ng/ml) and LH (10 ng/ml) augmented rat pineal melatonin content while 100 ng/ml of FSH decreased it significantly. Prolactin exerted a biphasic effect on rat pineal explants, the lowest concentration augmenting melatonin content while the high concentration depressed it. Deep, intermediate and superficial segments of guinea-pig pineal glands showed an increase in melatonin concentration after a 6-h incubation in the presence of 10(-7)-10(-5) M estradiol.",

Catecholamine neurotransmitters were visualized by derivatizing with glyoxylic acid and formaldehyde respectively. 3. Although all three methods lead to similar results, dansyl-propranolol gave the most rapid and strong fluorescence. 4.

    "56": "In the Swiss Ketanserin Study the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of ketanserin (given in 20 or 40 mg doses twice daily) was investigated, after a placebo run-in phase, as monotherapy (n = 68) as well as in combination with either atenolol (100 mg/day) (n = 30) or the potassium-sparing diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg/day) and amiloride (5 mg/day) (n = 26) in 124 patients with essential hypertension, aged 41 to 82 years. With the addition of ketanserin, diastolic blood pressure fell by 8 +/- 8, 8 +/- 8, and 7 +/- 9 (+/- SD) mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.05 for all) in the three treatment groups; heart rate remained unchanged or fell slightly. Ketanserin had no effect on body weight, or biochemical variables, including total serum cholesterol and triglycerides, with the exception of a minor increase in apolipoprotein B. Using a patient self-assessment questionnaire (30 items), the addition of ketanserin was associated with a reduction of most of the symptoms encountered in the placebo phase, including sleep disturbances, general feeling of weakness, headaches, nervousness, and fatigue, but there was a tendency toward increases in stuffy nose and dry mouth. In patients older than 60 years, the antihypertensive efficacy of ketanserin was greater, with 59% achieving a diastolic pressure less than or equal to 95 mm Hg versus 45% in the younger patients. This age trend also emerged when ketanserin was combined with either atenolol or the diuretic.", 
    "57": "In order to assess the medium-term efficacy of ketanserin in comparison with that of the beta-blocker, propranolol, a randomized double-blind crossover trial was conducted involving 13 patients suffering from mild or moderate essential hypertension. Six of these patients were also evaluated on an ambulatory basis using noninvasive intermittent blood pressure monitoring to corroborate these values. Results indicated that both ketanserin and propranolol significantly lowered systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure levels after 60-day treatment periods. Diastolic blood pressure levels of less than or equal to 90 mm Hg were achieved in seven patients following ketanserin therapy and in six patients after treatment with propranolol. Both ketanserin and propranolol reduced arterial blood pressure without interfering with its circadian rhythm and variability. A tendency for the blood pressure lowering effect of ketanserin to increase with age was also noted. Side effects were minimal. The results of this trial confirm the efficacy and safety of ketanserin for the treatment of mild or moderate hypertension.", 
    "58": "A double-blind controlled, randomized, parallel, multicenter 12-week study was conducted to compare the antihypertensive efficacy of lisinopril with that of metoprolol in treatment of moderate to severe hypertension. Initially, 118 patients were recruited on lisinopril and 61 on metoprolol; and for the purpose of efficacy analysis at week 8, 115 patients on lisinopril and 60 on metoprolol were included. The doses of lisinopril or metoprolol were 40-80 mg/day and 100-200 mg/day, respectively. At week 4, the pretreatment diastolic blood pressure of 111 mm Hg was decreased to 97 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) with lisinopril: metoprolol decreased the diastolic blood pressure from 110 to 99 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Similar decreases were noted at week 8; however, the drop in blood pressure with lisinopril was not significantly different from that with metoprolol. Systolic blood pressure also demonstrated a decrease of about 18 mm Hg with lisinopril and 12 mm Hg with metoprolol (p less than 0.01). This larger decrease in systolic blood pressure with lisinopril was statistically significant at week 4 (p less than 0.05). These decreases in systolic blood pressures were maintained at week 8, again with statistical significance (p less than 0.01). Of the 118 lisinopril-treated patients, four were discontinued from lisinopril therapy because of headache, dizziness, rash, flushing, or lymphadenopathy. Four patients out of 61 (9.8%) were discontinued from metoprolol therapy because of fatigue, somnolence, asthenia, weight gain, flatulence, tremor, or bronchospasm. In conclusion, lisinopril 40-80 mg once daily is as effective as metoprolol 100-200 mg once daily in reducing diastolic blood pressure in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "In a multicenter, parallel, double-blind study, lisinopril was compared with atenolol in the treatment of mild to moderate essential hypertension. Four hundred ninety patients were randomized to a once-a-day treatment with lisinopril 20 mg or atenolol 50 mg for 4 weeks, and the doses of lisinopril or atenolol were increased up to 80 mg or 200 mg, respectively, at 4-week intervals if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was not well controlled. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 or 25 mg was added after 12 weeks, if necessary, and titrated upward after 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 25 or 50 mg/day. Lisinopril and atenolol reduced SDBP to a similar extent. All reductions from baseline in sitting diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significant (less than 0.01). Lisinopril produced a significant (less than 0.01) greater reduction in sitting systolic blood pressure (SSBP) than atenolol. Addition of HCTZ caused further blood pressure reductions (p less than 0.01). Five patients (1.7%) on lisinopril and four (2.0%) on atenolol developed skin rashes during weeks 1-12. Two patients (0.7%) on lisinopril 80 mg developed proteinuria (greater than 1 g/day). Cough occurred more often with lisinopril (4.5%), and elevated triglycerides occurred more often with atenolol (2.0%).", 
    "60": "At the Cambridge Conference, the pros and cons of various classes of antihypertensive drugs were extensively discussed, including the place of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in today's spectrum. A consensus was easily reached that the most important advantage of having the present broad armamentarium of antihypertensive drugs is that a wide choice is now available from which to find the most suitable agent for the individual patient. A revised stepped-care design was proposed, in which the doctor has the choice of starting antihypertensive therapy with a thiazide diuretic, a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or a calcium antagonist. Small doses of any agent should be used to start with, and doses should not subsequently be increased beyond that at which side effects appear. Should such symptoms occur, the doctor has the choice of either switching to another first-step compound or reducing the dose of the first agent and combining it with one of other available drugs.", 
    "61": "The antihypertensive effect of felodipine, a new calcium antagonist with dihydropyridine structure, was investigated in 25 patients with essential hypertension that was not controlled on standard triple therapy (a beta-blocker, a diuretic, and a vasodilator). After substituting the previous vasodilator with felodipine, blood pressure was reduced and remained well controlled during a 2 year follow-up period. After about 1 1/2 years of treatment, felodipine was compared double-blind with placebo in a subgroup of 10 patients while keeping the same beta-blocker and diuretic therapy. Compared with the placebo, felodipine lowered blood pressure during a 12 h interval, which supports a twice-daily dosage in clinical practice. Determination of the plasma concentrations of felodipine during steady-state conditions showed a mean elimination half-life of 23.4 +/- 11.1 h. During long-term therapy, tolerance was good, and felodipine seems to be a safe and efficient antihypertensive agent in combination with a beta-blocker and a diuretic in patients whose hypertension is not adequately controlled on standard triple therapy.", 
    "62": "The effects of single oral doses of 10 mg felodipine and four beta-blockers (100 mg metoprolol, 5 mg pindolol, 80 mg propranolol, and 10 mg timolol) were evaluated alone and in combination in a 10-way crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 10 healthy male volunteers randomized to the medication sequence according to a latin square design. Adverse effects were recorded from spontaneous complaints and investigator observations. Heart rate (HR), PR interval, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured supine, standing, and after treadmill exercise, before and 2 h after drug administration. The adverse effects experienced with felodipine were as expected for a vasodilator. Seven subjects mentioned complaints voluntarily on the combinations while three experienced side effects receiving felodipine or beta-blocker alone. Felodipine increased resting HR significantly. Timolol produced a greater depression of exercise heart rate than the other beta-blockers, indicating that the dose given was not equivalent to that of the other beta-blockers. Pindolol was ineffective in preventing the increase in supine HR produced by felodipine. Felodipine did not alter PR interval at any level of activity, but rate-corrected supine PR interval was prolonged slightly by felodipine. Metoprolol and timolol significantly prolonged standing PR interval. All beta-blockers prolonged exercise PR interval. Felodipine/beta-blocker combinations did not prolong PR interval more than beta-blockers alone. Prolonged PR interval was the result of reduced HR and direct inhibition of atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Only timolol and the timolol/felodipine combination lowered supine systolic blood pressure significantly. Timolol and all beta-blocker/felodipine combinations reduced exercise SBP significantly.", 
    "63": "Felodipine lowers blood pressure by reducing peripheral vascular resistance through a highly selective action on smooth muscle in arteriolar resistance vessels. The selective action may be considered a safeguard against untoward effects on cardiac contractility and conduction. Felodipine does not cause orthostatic hypotension since it has no effect in clinical doses on venous smooth muscle. Felodipine has a natriuretic/diuretic effect, which counteracts the salt and water retention that is often seen during treatment with other potent vasodilators. In clinical studies, felodipine has proved more effective than several established antihypertensive drugs. The combination of felodipine and a beta-adrenergic blocker appears to be a good alternative to standard triple treatment, and felodipine is often effective in patients with previously \"refractory\" hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of felodipine is dose related. In patients with moderate hypertension, a dose regimen of 5 mg twice a day is usually sufficient, and doses greater than 10 mg twice a day are not often required. Felodipine is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are those expected from a potent arteriolar dilator: ankle swelling, headache, dizziness, flushing, etc. Adverse effects are usually transient or diminish in intensity with continued treatment. The overall frequency of adverse effects with felodipine appears to be similar to that for the established antihypertensive drugs, although the adverse effects differ. Felodipine is a potent arteriolar dilator with therapeutic advantages, especially for patients with moderate to severe hypertension.", 
    "64": "The effect of propranolol on clenbuterol-induced changes in muscle fibre size and protein content were studied. Propranolol did not inhibit the ability of clenbuterol to stimulate protein accretion but reduced the increase in muscle fibre size. The compositional and physical characteristics of clenbuterol-induced muscle growth thus appeared to be separated by propranolol.", 
    "65": "Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is a common clinical problem among hospitalized patients despite close attention to pharmacokinetics and dosing schedules. The present study was designed to evaluate the potential protective effect of nitrendipine, a calcium channel blocker, on the natural history of gentamicin renal injury in the rat. Gentamicin was administered intramuscularly in a dose of 40 mg/kg/day for 12 days to adult Fischer rats. Nitrendipine was given by gavage on a b.i.d. schedule in a dose of 30 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day. Gentamicin alone caused a significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF). Concurrent administration of nitrendipine did not influence RPF, but promoted a significant increase in GFR. Nitrendipine also prevented the increase in urinary excretion of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase, enzymatic markers of renal tubular injury in the gentamicin-treated animals. Gentamicin-induced pathologic injury was significantly ameliorated by nitrendipine. Renal cortical gentamicin content was diminished, but not significantly, by nitrendipine. The exact mechanism of action of nitrendipine in aminoglycoside-induced renal injury remains unknown. These observations suggest a potential pharmacologic approach to preventing a common problem with substantial morbidity.", 
    "66": "Smooth muscle cells of guinea pig urinary bladder were investigated by the intracellular perfusion and voltage clamp techniques. The application of ATP in concentration over 3.10(-8) mol/l elicited fast inward current. ADP, alpha, beta-methylene ATP and beta, gamma-methylene ATP had the similar effect. GTP, ITP, AMP and adenosine elicited no ionic current. AMP was a competitive blocker for receptors of ATP. No pharmacological distinctions were discovered between these receptors and ATP receptors of sensory neurons of the rat. ATP receptors had a fast desensitisation and extremely slow recovery of sensitivity to agonists. The rate of desensitisation decreased with the ATP concentration reduction.", 
    "67": "Adrenergic agonists inhibit the release of histamine from rat pleural and peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80 to a degree dependent on their beta-activity. Isoprenaline takes part in a stereoselective inhibitory action in the range 10(-7)-10(-4) M. Adrenaline induces a similar response pattern, with inhibition at higher concentrations. The response profile, but not the maximum values of inhibition, is clearly dependent on the concentration of the histamine releaser. Noradrenaline by itself is a histamine releaser, no stereoselectivity being observed. In the presence of compound 48/80 it takes part in a non-stereoselective inhibitory reaction at low concentrations. Inhibition of histamine release by isoprenaline was antagonized by 10 or 100 microM propranolol except at the highest isoprenaline concentration (1 mM). Both atenolol and propranolol nullified the inhibitory activity of noradrenaline, but not the increased histamine release it induces at higher concentrations (at least when acting in conjunction with compound 48/80). When rat mast cells are purified through Percoll, a change in their response profiles is observed. Isoprenaline and adrenaline by themselves elicit non-specific release of histamine; with compound 48/80, release is additive in the case of isoprenaline and supra-additive in the case of adrenaline. Results point to the loss of beta-adrenergic inhibitory activity after purification.", 
    "68": "The pharmacological properties of an ultrashort-acting beta-receptor blocking agent, flestolol, were evaluated in rabbits. Infusion of graded doses (1-100 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) into conscious rabbits produced dose-dependent bradycardia without any significant effect on mean arterial pressure. A desired level of heart rate could be obtained by either increasing or decreasing the dose infused. Such titration could be done by changing the dose of flestolol at 20-min intervals. Infusion of 31 micrograms/kg/min of flestolol into reserpinized, conscious rabbits had no effect on mean arterial pressure or heart rate but produced significant inhibition of isoproterenol-induced hypotension and tachycardia. This dose had no effect on the chronotropic and vascular effects of norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II, adenosine, or acetylcholine. In these rabbits, flestolol was greater than 10-fold as active as esmolol, another ultrashort-acting beta-blocking agent, in inhibiting the responses to isoproterenol. In rabbits under pentobarbital anesthesia, infusion of flestolol (3.1, 10, and 31 micrograms/kg/min) produced dose-dependent beta-receptor blockade. On termination of a 70-min infusion, recovery of the responses to isoproterenol occurred within 30 min. In a separate series of experiments, the effects of infusion of flestolol (10 micrograms/kg/min) into the portal vein were compared with the effects of infusion of the same dose of flestolol into the femoral vein of anesthetized rabbits. Infusion into the femoral vein produced bradycardia and inhibited the hypotensive as well as cardioaccelerator effects of isoproterenol. Infusion into the portal vein was devoid of either effect, suggesting extensive inactivation by the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Effect of 3-4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropoxy)-3-nitroxy-2H-1-b enzopyran (K-351) infused into the renal artery on renin release during graded renal nerve stimulation (RNS) was investigated in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. K-351 (20 micrograms/min) produced significant suppression of the RNS-induced renin release; the renin secretion responses to RNS at lower frequencies (0.5 and 1 Hz) were almost abolished, and those at the highest frequency (3 Hz) were attenuated. K-351 also suppressed an increase in renal vascular resistance during RNS at 3 Hz. The same extent of inhibition in the renin secretion response to RNS was also obtained during infusion of DL-propranolol (100 micrograms/min). Inhibitory effect of K-351, prazosin, or phentolamine on the renal vasoconstriction induced by RNS and norepinephrine (NE) injected into the renal artery, an approximately 50% reduction in renal blood flow, was also assessed. K-351 and prazosin exerted a greater inhibitory effect on RNS-than on NE-induced vasoconstriction, and the opposite was true of phentolamine. The potency of K-351 in reducing the vasoconstriction due to RNS or NE was roughly estimated to be 10-30 times less than that of prazosin. These results suggest that K-351 shares beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor blocking properties, which effectively contribute to the suppression of adrenergically induced renin release and renal vasoconstriction.", 
    "70": "A \"stepped-care\" approach has been widely recommended for more than 10 years as an empiric method for the treatment of hypertension. This approach encourages the use of diuretics or beta blockers as initial monotherapy for hypertension. Although these and other antihypertensive regimens tested in clinical trials have substantially reduced morbidity and mortality from cerebrovascular disease, their relative effectiveness in reducing the sequelae of coronary artery disease is not as well established. These findings, coupled with the development of new drug regimens, have led to a re-examination of the stepped-care guidelines. This re-examination will stimulate increased interest in the therapeutic choices made by practicing physicians, particularly because the newer drugs are more costly than the traditional treatments. To address this question, we performed two specific studies, using data bases from Michigan and Tennessee Medicaid programs. The first study analyzed prescriptions for newly diagnosed cases of essential hypertension. The second study analyzed secular trends in the prescribing of antihypertensive regimens since that time. The data suggest that in 1982 and 1983 (the time period under consideration in the first part of the study), physicians treating hypertension for Medicaid enrollees followed the stepped-care recommendations, the majority using diuretics as step-one monotherapy. The secular trend data in the second study showed a moderate decrease in the use of diuretics since 1983. There were marked increases in the use of newer antihypertensive medications such as calcium channel blockers and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Because the costs of the newer drugs are substantially higher, a shift to these drugs would significantly increase the cost of treating hypertension in this country. Prospective, controlled trials are necessary to ascertain if the increased costs of the newly developed drugs are justified by potential benefits.", 
    "71": "The widespread prevalence of hypertension in the United States and the enormous expense and effort associated with its treatment necessitate a cost-conscious approach to evaluation and therapy. In the past, we have devoted too many resources to testing for rare diseases suspected of causing hypertension when it has been demonstrated that secondary causes are rare. Devoting resources to the effective treatment of essential hypertension itself should be a priority, because such treatment has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. Clinical and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that treatment for hypertension should not be initiated unless diastolic blood pressure readings are 90 mm Hg or greater on three successive office visits. Treatment should be carried out in a step-wise fashion, using a non-pharmacologic approach only in situations in which hypertension is mild, target organ disease is absent, and compliance is favorable. Diuretics should be used as step-one drug therapy in most situations, because they are effective in the majority of patients, convenient to use, easy to titrate, and comparatively inexpensive. They do not cause salt and water retention, and side effects are usually minimal. When the use of diuretics is contraindicated, beta blockers are suitable alternatives, equally effective in most respects. When beta blockers or other non-diuretic drugs are used as step-one therapy and an additional drug is needed, diuretics can be used advantageously in conjunction with the step-one drug.", 
    "72": "In the summer of 1986, the Gallup Organization conducted two surveys, one of the physicians who treat hypertension and the other of patients who were receiving medications for hypertension. Objectives were to assess current patterns of treatment and the impact of cost on treatment for hypertension. Seventy percent of the patients report being prescribed medication immediately following the diagnosis of hypertension. Diuretics are the most frequently prescribed initial medication (76 percent of physicians), followed by beta blockers (44 percent of physicians). Physicians report recent trends, however, towards more use of beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and less use of diuretics. Only 59 percent of patients have insurance that covers medication, and about one in four patients report that paying for medications or physicians' fees is \"very much\" or \"somewhat\" of a problem. The costs of care are of concern to physicians as well as to patients.", 
    "73": "Short-term observation following Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy indicates that serious elevation of intra-ocular pressure may occur, unrelated to the amount of energy used. In this study the IOP in 3 groups of 10 pseudophakic patients undergoing Nd-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was measured before capsulotomy and 2 and 4 hours afterwards, using the fellow-eye as control. The first group received no medication, the second received timolol 1/2% eyedrops preoperatively, the third group a combination of timolol 1/2% and 1 tablet of acetazolamide 250 mg systemically. Pretreatment with timolol 0.5% minimizes IOP-rise but does not give complete protection. The combination of timolol 0.5% with 1 tablet of acetazolamide 250 mg proves to be a safe procedure for the prevention of IOP-rise after YAG laser capsulotomy. To prevent other complications it is advisable to make a small capsulotomy of 2-3 mm diameter using as little energy as possible. Also a defocussing system in the laser is a great advantage. Indomethacin drops during a period of 6 weeks after Nd-YAG laser capsulotomy should prevent cystoid macular edema.", 
    "74": "In rabbit pulmonary artery, dopamine (10(-11)-10(-5) M) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of the arterial strips contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) in the presence of prazosin (10(-6) M), yohimbine (10(-6) M), propranolol (10(-6) M), and methysergide (10(-6) M). SKF38393, an agonist for D1 or DA1 dopamine receptor, mimicked partially the concentration-response curve for dopamine, whereas LY171555 and apomorphine did not. The order of potency of dopamine antagonists on the inhibitory effect was: cis-flupenthixol greater than bulbo-capnine greater than metoclopramide greater than haloperidol. Sulpiride was inactive. Cis-flupenthixol did not block the relaxation induced by acetylcholine, adenosine, and papaverine. In the arterial strips of the rabbits pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine, the concentration-response curve for dopamine was similar to that in non-treated rabbits. Thus it is concluded that a specific dopamine receptor is located on the postsynaptic muscle membrane of the rabbit pulmonary artery.", 
    "75": "This study was undertaken to investigate further the CNS actions of commonly employed antihypertensive drugs. Measurements of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma catecholamines (CA) were made in an attempt to estimate the activity of central and peripheral noradrenergic neurons during treatment with or after abrupt discontinuation of treatment with clonidine (CLO), propranolol (PRO), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or placebo, in patients with essential hypertension. A randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled, single-blind design was employed. BP reductions equal to or greater than 10 mmHg were observed with CLO (0.36 +/- 0.07 mg daily), PRO (160 mg +/- 0 mg daily) or HCTZ (70 +/- 12 mg daily). CLO reduced plasma norepinephrine (NE) by 64% and PRO increased it by 25%. Neither HCTZ nor placebo modified plasma NE. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was reduced by PRO (51%, P less than 0.01) and CLO (35%, P less than 0.05). CSF-NE levels (pg/ml) were significantly lower in the CLO group (CLO: 175 +/- 23; PRO: 278 +/- 35; HCTZ: 255 +/- 34; placebo: 203 +/- 7).", 
    "76": "The relative activities of d-, 1- and racemic-sotalol were studied in two series of anesthetized dogs. Estimates of relative beta-adrenergic blocking potency were based upon the ability of the compounds to antagonize isoproterenol-elicited increases in heart rate and decreases in diastolic blood pressure. On a molar basis, d-sotalol displayed 1/12-1/14th and 1-sotalol 1.6-3.2 X the potency of the racemic parent drug as beta-antagonists. His bundle electrogram (HBE) measurements, surface ECG recordings and the extra stimulus technique at a constant pacing cycle length were utilized to assess the comparative effects of sotalol and its optical isomers on cardiac conduction and refractoriness. At i.v. doses spanning equiactive beta-blocking levels, d- (1, 4, 16 mg X kg-1), 1- (0.25, 1, 4 mg X kg-1) or dl-sotalol (0.5, 2, 8 mg X kg-1) caused dose-dependent increases in ventricular and, to an even greater extent, atrial refractoriness. The mean plasma drug concentrations (Cp) attained with these doses were: d-sotalol 9.5, 44 and 267 nmol X l-1; 1-sotalol 9.6, 16 and 66 nmol X l-1; and dl-sotalol 5.4, 23 and 106 nmol X l-1. The relative mg potency from greatest to least was 1-sotalol greater than dl-sotalol greater than d-sotalol in prolonging the ventricular effective refractory period (V-ERP); the mean increases above control at the highest dose of each were 58 +/- 4, 47 +/- 6 and 38 +/- 3 ms, respectively. At those same dose levels, atrial refractoriness (A-ERP) was maximally elevated 49 +/- 11, 82 +/- 5 and 104 +/- 10 ms by 1-, dl- and d-sotalol, respectively. These increases in refractoriness occurred without alterations in atrial, His-Purkinje or ventricular conduction velocity; however, all three forms of sotalol significantly reduced AV nodal conduction. At the dose multiples studied, the effects on this variable (AH interval) were greatest following 1-sotalol (20-60 ms) or racemic sotalol (20-57 ms) and least following the d-isomer (7-43 ms). The profile of effects observed with d-sotalol is that of an agent with Class III electrophysiologic effects and weak beta-adrenergic blocking properties.", 
    "77": "The glycogen-bound form of protein phosphatase-1 (termed protein phosphatase-1G) is composed of the catalytic (C) subunit complexed to a glycogen-binding (G) subunit that anchors the enzyme to glycogen [Str\u00e5lfors et al. (1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 149, 295-303]. Incubation of purified protein phosphatase-1G with cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and MgATP, which leads to stoichiometric phosphorylation of the G-subunit [Caudwell et al. (1986) FEBS Lett. 194, 85-90], was found to promote the release of the phosphatase from glycogen; similar observations were made using glycogen-protein particle preparations. An intravenous injection of adrenaline decreased protein phosphatase-1 activity associated with the glycogen-protein particles by 50% with a corresponding increase in the amount present in the cytosol. By contrast, adrenaline did not affect the distribution of glycogen synthase or glycogen phosphorylase which remained entirely bound to glycogen in these experiments. The specific release of protein phosphatase-1 from glycogen may facilitate its inactivation by inhibitor-1 in the cytosol, thereby preventing dephosphorylation of the glycogen metabolising enzymes. Translocation of protein phosphatase-1 may represent a novel mechanism for the activation of glycogenolysis and inhibition of glycogen synthesis by adrenaline.", 
    "78": "beta-Adrenergic receptors in guinea-pig liver plasma membranes were characterized by radioligand binding, using l-[3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA), l-3-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) and dl-[3H]4-(3-tertiarybutylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-benzimidazole-2- one hydrochloride [( 3H]CGP-12177). The binding of both [125I]CYP and [3H]CGP-12177 to membranes exhibited high affinity (Kd = 3.5 +/- 0.2 pM for [125I]CYP and 0.75 +/- 0.10 nM for [3H]CGP-12177) and stereospecificity; the maximal binding sites were 130 +/- 15 and 137 +/- 8 fmoles/mg protein respectively. Catecholaminergic agonists competed for these binding sites in the order l-isoproterenol greater than l-epinephrine greater than l-norepinephrine, which is typical for beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The binding data are supported by parallel experiments on adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamines, and on antagonism of this activation by beta 1- and beta 2-selective blockers. The binding of [3H]DHA was excessive (Bmax = 21.4 pmoles/mg protein), exhibited low affinity (Kd = 34.6 nM), and lacked stereospecificity. When liver membranes were incubated at 50 degrees for 40 min in the presence of an agonist, l-isoproterenol, the binding of [3H]DHA to the heat-treated membranes exhibited high affinity (Kd = 1.07 +/- 0.17 nM) and the Bmax was reduced to 139 +/- 22 fmoles/mg protein. In such membranes, as opposed to native membranes, stereospecificity was evident and catecholaminergic agonists competed for the binding sites in the order typical for beta 2-adrenergic receptors. However, agonist competition of the binding to the heat-treated membranes could not be modulated by guanine nucleotides, indicating a loss of communication between the receptor and the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.", 
    "79": "Mammalian beta 2-adrenergic receptors (R) have been shown to be structurally heterogeneous with respect to glycosylation (Stiles et al. J. biol. Chem. 259, 8655 (1984). They are also heterogeneous with respect to functional coupling to Ns. The ternary H.R.Ns complex can be frozen in the presence of the alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide. In hamster lung membranes 45% of the receptors are agonist/N-ethylmaleimide sensitive (i.e. coupling-prone receptors). beta-Receptors in both native and isoproterenol/N-ethylmaleimide pretreated membrane preparations are retained by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin and are equally sensitive to neuraminidase treatment. This is exhibited by the increase in mobility of the 125I-iodocyanopindolol-azide photoaffinity labeled receptor peptide in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These observations suggest that there is no link between the structural and functional heterogeneity of the receptors. Moreover, both partial (using neuraminidase) and near total (using endoglycosidase F) deglycosylation of membrane-bound receptors does not affect the H.R.-Ns coupling capacity as compared to native receptors.", 
    "80": "Prophylaxis of bleeding from esophageal varices is a very tempting concept at first glance, especially under the assumption of a high mortality associated with first variceal hemorrhage. Up to now four different measures have been tried for prophylaxis: portacaval shunt operation, devascularization procedures, sclerotherapy, and drugs. With the exception of portacaval shunts, ongoing controlled trials show a weak trend toward reduction of variceal bleeding and prolongation of survival in selected patients with compensated cirrhosis and large varices. However, prophylaxis of first variceal bleeding must still be regarded as experimental and should be restricted to controlled clinical studies.", 
    "81": "The structure of the human beta-adrenergic receptor in purified basal membranes of human placental syncytiotrophoblast was probed using photoaffinity labeling. Basal membranes display a high specific activity of receptors (4-5 pmol/mg protein) and possess both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors subtypes. Autoradiography of membranes that were incubated with the beta-adrenergic antagonist [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol, photolyzed and then subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, identified four radiolabeled peptides, Mr = 65-kDa, 54-kDa, 43-kDa and a novel higher molecular weight 76-kDa form of the receptor. Photoaffinity labeling of each of these four peptides displayed the pharmacological properties expected for true beta-adrenergic receptors. The 76-kDa photoaffinity labeled receptor peptide observed in human placenta basal membranes has not been reported elsewhere. Competition studies with the beta1-selective ligand CGP-20712A demonstrate that the photoaffinity labeled receptor peptides are composed of both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes.", 
    "82": "Calcium antagonist monotherapy is more effective in older patients and in those with low plasma renin activity, whereas beta blockers control blood pressure better in younger patients and in those with normal or high renin activity. Monotherapy with a calcium antagonist has been shown to result in the reduction of diastolic blood pressure to equal to or less than 95 mm Hg in more than 80 percent of patients with essential hypertension. We investigated the antihypertensive efficacy of verapamil plus an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and nifedipine plus a beta blocker in 24 patients (aged 41 to 68) with moderate to severe hypertension in whom monotherapy with a calcium antagonist had been ineffective. Blood pressure recorded in patients during the placebo period was 175 +/- 3/111 +/- 2 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM). Twelve patients received monotherapy with nifedipine (50.0 +/- 5.2 mg per day) and 12 others received verapamil (460 +/- 20 mg per day); neither treatment resulted in the reduction of diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg. However, this goal was achieved when atenolol (89.5 +/- 25.7 mg per day) was added to the regimen of patients receiving nifedipine and enalapril (29.5 +/- 5.0 mg per day) was added to the regimen of those receiving verapamil; resultant blood pressures were 127 +/- 3/83 +/- 2 mm Hg and 137 +/- 5/85 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively. It is suggested that in patients in whom hypertension is inadequately controlled by calcium antagonist monotherapy, counter-regulatory mechanisms can be blocked by the addition of a beta blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to the calcium antagonist regimen, resulting in greatly improved, simple, well-tolerated, and safe control of blood pressure.", 
    "83": "Because we so rarely know the cause of hypertension, antihypertensive therapy remains empiric. However, certain principles of treatment are emerging; one of these concerns the critical role of the kidney in antihypertensive therapy. Whether or not the kidney is primarily responsible for hypertension in a patient, it is the patient's renal response to treatment that determines, to a major degree, an agent's efficacy. Vasodilators have been a conceptually attractive approach to the treatment of high blood pressure, because they decrease total peripheral resistance, which is considered to be the mechanism responsible for this condition in most patients. Nonspecific vasodilators exert a series of actions on the kidney--including profound sodium retention and reactive renin release--that limits therapeutic response. For reasons that are not yet clear, but are apparently related to specific action on calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle, endocrine function, and renal hemodynamics, calcium channel blocking agents, such as nifedipine, have an advantage in the treatment of hypertension. They cause little or no sodium retention; thus, the addition of a diuretic agent is not required. In fact, there is evidence that sodium loading in certain patients may potentiate the antihypertensive efficacy of these drugs. The renin-angiotensin system seems to be activated to a somewhat lesser degree by calcium channel blocking agents than it is by nonspecific vasodilators; in addition, these agents interfere with the actions of angiotensin on aldosterone release. Moreover, their dilator action on the renal blood supply favors sodium excretion. Nifedipine either has no effect on the renal blood supply or induces an increase in renal blood flow and maintains glomerular filtration rate, both of which combine to support the ensuing natriuresis.", 
    "84": "In rat striatal slices, 30 nM of L-DOPA increased the impulse (5 Hz)-evoked release of dopamine (DA), without increasing the spontaneous release and tissue content of DA. The minimum dose required to increase spontaneous DA release was 0.1 microM and the dose which led to an accumulation of DA was 100 microM. In the presence of NSD-1055, a DOPA-decarboxylase inhibitor, L-DOPA-induced increases in spontaneous DA release were prevented and L-DOPA produced dual actions on the evoked release of DA, a stereoselective propranolol-sensitive increase at 30 nM and a stereoselective sulpiride-sensitive decrease at 1 microM. L-DOPA produces dual presynaptic regulatory actions on DA release, via facilitatory beta-adrenoceptors at 30 nM and inhibitory DA receptors at 1 microM. The primary action of L-DOPA appears to be the facilitation of release of DA rather than the conversion to DA.", 
    "85": "The Ca(2+) indicator 7-chlorotetracycline has been shown to bind to a pore complex on both outer surfaces of all non-meristematic cells in the unistratose thallus of Riella ('chlorotetracycline-binding surface region'=CSR; Grotha, 1983, Planta 158, 473-481). Prolonged treatment of the thallus with 7-chlorotetracycline, 5-hydroxytetracycline, verapamil and desmethoxyverapamil induces the deposition of callose at the same region. The influence of various treatments on verapamil-induced CSR-callose was measured in situ by microfluorometry of aniline-blue-stained material. Callose deposition is maximal at 10(-4)M verapamil or 5\u00b710(-5)M desmethoxyverapamil with 2\u00b710(-4)M Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) in the medium. The reaction is completely inhibited at pH 5.5 and is optimal between pH 6.5 and 7.5. The production of CSR-callose is absolutely light-dependent with callose being first visible after 30 min of light. La(3+), ethylene glycol-bis(\u03b2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid and amiprophosmethyl, antagonists of Ca(2+) functions, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose suppress the verapamil induction of CSR-callose. Furthermore the ionophores A 23187, valinomycin and monensin effectively block the reaction. The deposition of CSR-callose is diminished at increasing external osmolarity and is abolished at osmotic values that stimulate plasmolysis-callose. Wounding causes the formation of wound-callose but inhibits the induction of CSR-callose in cells of the wound edge. Nifedipine increases or prolongs callose synthesis in cell plates. The Ca(2+)-channel blocker diltiazem is completely ineffective. It is suggested as a working hypothesis that verapamil-induced CSR-callose synthesis is caused by a local change in membrane permeability, possibly as a consequence of the opening of Ca(2+) channels being involved in Golgi-vesicle mediated exocytosis (A. Kramer and H. Lehmann, 1986, Ber. Dtsch. Bot. Ges. 99, 111-121).", 
    "86": "The QT-interval in the surface electrocardiogram (usually lead II) and the effective refractory period of the right ventricle (ERP-V) were investigated in 16 patients with documented supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and in 18 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia (VT) during basic pacing (QT1) and programmed stimulation of the right ventricular apex (QT2) (single-test stimulation at 3 different rates, BCL: 600 ms, 500 ms, 430 ms). The effects of intravenous and oral Sotalol were analysed in the SVT-group. An increase in heart rate was followed by a significant decrease of the QT-intervals and ERP-V in both groups. The QT-intervals and the ERP-V were statistically significantly prolonged by intravenous Sotalol. The VT-group showed a statistically significant longer shortest QT2-interval during programmed stimulation, which can be explained by a greater dispersion of action potentials leading to an inhomogenous ventricular recovery process, which may represent the electrical substrate for the arrhythmia.", 
    "87": "Propranolol (0.5 mg X kg-1 X 5 min-1), alinidine (1 mg X kg-1 X 5 min-1) and the benzazepinon UL-FS 49 (0.5 mg X kg-1 X 5 min-1) were investigated in a canine model of exercise-induced transient myocardial dysfunction, mimicking exercise-induced functional impairment during angina pectoris in man. Each drug was infused intravenously, after two control treadmill exercise runs had shown comparable, ultrasonically assessed regional contractile dysfunction in an area supplied by a partly stenosed branch of the left coronary artery. All three drugs abolished exercise-induced regional contractile dysfunction. Propranolol and alinidine comparably decreased heart rate and positive dp/dtmax during exercise. UL-FS 49 showed a marked negative chronotropic effect without affecting positive dp/dtmax. Thus, prevention of exercise-induced regional contractile dysfunction has been shown for the first time using a selective bradycardic agent.", 
    "88": "Previous observations by Almgren and Jonason (1974) showed that propranolol is able to increase the extraneuronal accumulation of 3H-isoprenaline in rat salivary gland slices. The present experiments were carried out in order to test the hypothesis that 3H-isoprenaline, by acting on beta-adrenoceptors, might depolarize the gland cells and thereby hinder its own uptake2 and that this hindrance might be prevented by propranolol. After inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase the extraneuronal accumulation of the 3H-catecholamine in slices of rat salivary glands was determined subsequent to 20 min of exposure of the tissue to 0.5 to 5,000 nmol/l 3H-(+/-)-isoprenaline. Expressed as a tissue/medium ratio, accumulation decreased with increasing amine concentration, although all amine concentrations were well below those saturating uptake2. The 3H-isoprenaline-induced decrease of the tissue/medium ratio was antagonized by (-)-propranolol, and increasing concentrations of the antagonist were needed to antagonize the effect of increasing concentrations of 3H-isoprenaline. In parallel experiments K+-induced (60 mmol/l) depolarization reduced the tissue/medium ratio observed for 0.5 nmol/l 3H-(+/-)-isoprenaline. Gland slices were preloaded with 3H-(+/-)-isoprenaline and then washed out for 60 min with solution not containing labelled amine. When 500 nmol/l (+/-)-isoprenaline were present in the wash-out solution, the addition of 10 mumol/l (-)-propranolol impeded the efflux of 3H-isoprenaline. In parallel experiments, K+-induced (60 mmol/l) depolarization facilitated the efflux of 3H-isoprenaline [in the presence of 10 mumol/l (-)-propranolol]. The results support the working hypothesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "Superfused mouse bladder strip responded to electrical stimulation (ES) by twitch contractions. These contractions were potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; 0.03-3.0 microM). Three tryptamine analogues were tested for their ability to potentiate the responses to ES and their relative activities were compared with values in the literature. 5-Carboxamidotryptamine was more potent than 5-HT, N-omega-methyl 5-HT was about equipotent, and alpha-methyl 5-HT was much less potent. Exogenous noradrenaline did not reduce the effect of 5-HT, although it reduced the response of the tissue to ES. The maximum increase in tissue tension evoked by 5-HT was unaltered by phentolamine (1 microM) or bretylium (25 microM). These results show that 5-HT did not act on the bladder by inhibiting the release of catecholamines from intrinsic nerves. The effect of 5-HT proved very resistant to attempts to block it with conventional 5-HT antagonists. Several antagonists were studied including ketanserin, methysergide, methiothepin, and MDL 72222 but even at concentrations as high as 1 microM none of them exhibited any marked inhibitory effect against the action of 5-HT. At 10 microM some compounds showed activity, but none abolished the effect except methiothepin - and its action was not surmountable by increasing the concentration of 5-HT. Thus the effect of 5-HT on the bladder was not mediated by 5-HT receptors of types 'M', 'D' or 5-HT2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "The effect of chronic administration of two beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, propranolol and timolol, on transmitter noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves has been investigated in vivo using the pithed rat preparation. Oral treatment for 4 weeks with either propranolol (46.3 mg/kg/day) or timolol (7.1 mg/kg/day) significantly raised the stimulation frequency threshold for release of radioactivity on stimulation of the whole spinal outflow of the pithed rat after i.v. injection of 3H-NA. No differences in the stimulation-evoked rise in mean arterial pressure were observed between control or treated rats nor was the heart rate response to stimulation altered after timolol treatment. However, in propranolol treated rats the mean rises in heart rate were significantly higher with 3 and 30 Hz stimulation than in control rats. Timolol treatment significantly increased the blood concentration and lowered the heart content of 3H-NA whilst propranolol treatment did not significantly change either blood or heart levels. Log dose-response curves for mean rises in heart rate after i.v. isoprenaline were not shifted to the right in either propranolol or timolol treated pithed rats. With the lowest doses of isoprenaline (1 and 25 ng), the mean rises in heart rate in timolol treated rats were significantly greater than in the controls. Thus chronic administration of propranolol or timolol decreased the stimulation-induced increase in plasma 3H-NA but this change in release was not related to reduced rises in blood pressure or heart rate.", 
    "91": "Injection of worker honeybees with noradrenaline, in vivo, depresses the haemolymph levels of phospholipid, steroid and triacylglycerols. The major fatty acids fraction shows large amplitude variations which seem to be dependent on several distinct factors. Adrenochrome exhibits a tendency to induce global hypoglycemic effects without evident correlation with the other hormones, whereas propranolol counteracts the effects of noradrenaline, particularly for phospholipids, steroids and diacylglycerols. The results suggest that the major lipoproteic complex is partly under the control of low specificity adrenoceptors."
