Pharmaceuticals are suspected of having effects on freshwater biota at very low concentrations, although the nature of these effects remains unclear. Previous data from the Llobregat River revealed a positive statistical relationship between the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates and the presence of certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta-blockers. Here, experiments were conducted with the midge Chironomus riparius and the freshwater snail Physella (Costatella) acuta in sediments and water, respectively. The sediments and water were treated with the pharmaceuticals propranolol and indomethacin, with the aims of assaying the effects of these compounds on the organisms and testing the statistical relationships observed in field. The variables measured were survival; C. riparius biomass; and the carbon/nitrogen ratio, lipid content and fertility of freshwater snails. Indomethacin in treated sediments induced an increase in C. riparius biomass, whereas propranolol inhibited growth, albeit at marginal statistical significance. By contrast, indomethacin in water had no effect on any of the parameters measured in P. acuta.",

This was a retrospective cohort study including patients enrolled from five centers. Patients were included if they were treated with timolol maleate 0.1% or 0.5% gel-forming solution and had photographic documentation of the IH and at least one follow-up visit. Patients with concomitant active treatment using other IH treatments were excluded. The primary endpoint was change in the appearance of IH as evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS).

    "30": "Carvedilol, a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, is widely used for the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. We examined the action of carvedilol on cloned Kv1.5 expressed in CHO cells, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Carvedilol reduced the peak amplitude of Kv1.5 and accelerated the inactivation rate in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 2.56 \u03bcM. Using a first-order kinetics analysis, we calculated k(+1) = 19.68 \u03bcM(-1)s(-1) for the association rate constant, and k(-1) = 44.89 s(-1) for the dissociation rate constant. The apparent K(D) (k(-1)/k(+1)) was 2.28 \u03bcM, which is similar to the IC50 value. Other \u03b2-adrenergic blockers (alprenolol, oxprenolol and carteolol) had little or no effect on Kv1.5 currents. Carvedilol slowed the deactivation time course, resulting in a tail crossover phenomenon. Carvedilol-induced block was voltage-dependent in the voltage range for channel activation, but voltage-independent in the voltage range for full activation. The voltage dependences for both steady-state activation and inactivation were unchanged by carvedilol. Carvedilol affected Kv1.5 in a use-dependent manner. When stimulation frequencies were increased to quantify a use-dependent block, however, the block by carvedilol was slightly increased with IC50 values of 2.56 \u03bcM at 0.1 Hz, 2.38 \u03bcM at 1 Hz and 2.03 \u03bcM at 2 Hz. Carvedilol also slowed the time course of recovery from inactivation of Kv1.5. These results indicate that carvedilol blocks Kv1.5 in a reversible, concentration-, voltage-, time-, and use-dependent manner, but only at concentrations slightly higher than therapeutic plasma concentrations in humans. These effects are probably relevant to an understanding of the ionic mechanism underlying the antiarrhythmic property of carvedilol.",

Hypertension could affect pelvic arterial blood flow, resulting in loss of smooth muscle in the bladder with resultant loss of bladder compliance. Spontaneously hypertensive rats are considered a valuable tool for exploring the pathogenesis of DO. Some reports indicate that \u03b1(1) adrenoceptor antagonists improve chronic ischaemia of the lower urinary tract in patients with LUTS, with concomitant improvement of their symptoms as well as improvement of DO through an increased bladder blood flow (BBF) in the rat with bladder outlet obstruction. However, the mechanism of improvement of silodosin on storage or irritative symptoms is not well investigated and is still unclear.

Six weeks after silodosin treatment, voiding functions were estimated by voiding behaviour and cystometric studies in all groups. The bladder blood flow was measured by the hydrogen clearance method, and tissue levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Moreover, the SHRs showed significant decreases in bladder blood flow and single voided volume estimated by both voiding behaviour and cystometric studies compared with those in the Wistar rats. Six weeks of treatment with silodosin significantly ameliorated hypertension-related alterations of these variables with concomitant small changes of blood pressure. The expression levels of \u03b11 adrenoceptor subtype mRNAs in the bladder were similar in all the groups and the rank order was \u03b11A = \u03b11D > \u03b11B in all groups.

    "36": "The amide proton exchange rates in various lanthanide(III) DOTA-tetraamide complexes were investigated by CEST as a function of variable chemical structures and charges on the amide substituents. Comparisons were made between YbDOTA-(gly)(4)(-) (Yb-1), YbDOTA-(NHCH(2)PO(3))(4 (5-) (Yb-2) and YbDOTA-(NHCH(2)PO(3)Et(2))(4)(3+) (Yb-3). The general shapes of the CEST vs pH profiles were similar for the three complexes but they showed maximum CEST intensities at different pH values, pH 8.3, 8.8 and 6.9 for Yb-1, Yb-2 and Yb-3, respectively. This indicates that a more negatively charged substituent on the amide helps stabilize the partial positive charge on the amide nitrogen and consequently more base is required to catalyze proton exchange. The chemical shifts of the -NH protons in Yb-1 and Yb-2 were similar (-17 ppm) while the -NH proton in Yb-3 was at -13 ppm. This shows that the crystal field produced by the amide oxygen donor atoms in Yb-3 is substantially weaker than that in the other two complexes. In an effort to expand the useful range of pH values that might be measured using these complexes as CEST agents, the shapes of the CEST vs pH curves were also determined for two thulium(III) complexes with much larger hyperfine shifted -NH proton resonances. The ratio of CEST from -NH exchange in Tm-1 compared with CEST from -NH exchange in Tm-3 was found to be linear over an extended pH range, from 6.3 to 7.4. This demonstrates a potential advantage of using mixtures of lanthanide(III) DOTA-tetraamides for mapping tissue pH by use of ratiometric CEST imaging.", 
    "37": "Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is an uncommon form of arrhythmia characterized by an increased heart rate that is out of proportion to a normal physiologic demand. The etiology of IST remains ill-defined and controversial. Clinical presentation of IST is highly variable, from isolated to sustained palpitations, and can cause deterioration in one's quality of life. IST is usually a diagnosis of exclusion and it is important to rule out other causes of sinus tachycardia before reaching a final diagnosis. Evaluation of cardiac autonomic reflex function is essential to support the diagnosis of IST. The treatment of IST aims to target the multiple mechanisms involved in this disease, and multidisciplinary management, including cardiac rehabilitation, pharmacotherapy, and occasionally radiofrequency modification of the sinus node, should be considered. The prognosis is usually benign, although regular follow-up is required to optimize therapy and prevent the onset of tachycardiomyopathy.", 
    "38": "The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome consists of a group of inherited connective tissue disorders caused by defects in the synthesis of collagen. The vascular type 4 form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (VEDS) is associated with serious vascular complications in young adults, such as the spontaneous rupture of large-caliber and medium-caliber arteries, often without true aneurysm formation or dissection. VEDS is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait that is caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene. It affects the synthesis and structure of the pro a1 (III) chain of collagen type III, which causes vascular wall weakness. The diagnosis of VEDS is made from major and minor clinical criteria and can be confirmed by abnormalities in procollagen production and molecular genetic testing. Recently, the results of a study using the b-blocker celiprolol demonstrated a reduction in vascular complications of VEDS. The mechanisms of benefit may be related to a reduction in vascular hemodynamic stress with exercise and/or through a reduction in transforming growth factor-b. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may also be beneficial in VEDS. Surgery may be beneficial in treating the complications of VEDS.", 
    "39": "Heart failure (HF) involves changes in cardiac structure, myocardial composition, myocyte deformation, and multiple biochemical and molecular alterations that impact heart function and reserve capacity. Collectively, these changes have been referred to as 'cardiac remodeling'. Understanding the components of this process with the goal of stopping or reversing its progression has become a major objective. This concept is often termed 'reverse remodeling', and is successfully achieved by inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \u03b2-blockers, and device therapies such as cardiac resynchronization or ventricular assist devices. Not every method of reverse remodeling has long-lasting clinical efficacy. However, thus far, every successful clinical treatment with long-term benefits on the morbidity and mortality of patients with HF reverses remodeling. Reverse remodeling is defined by lower chamber volumes (particularly end-systolic volume) and is often accompanied by improved \u03b2-adrenergic and heart-rate responsiveness. At the cellular level, reverse remodeling impacts on myocyte size, function, excitation-contraction coupling, bioenergetics, and a host of molecular pathways that regulate contraction, cell survival, mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and other features. Here, we review the current evidence for reverse remodeling by existing therapies, and discuss novel approaches that are rapidly moving from preclinical to clinical trials.", 
    "40": "This study was aimed at examining the effect of tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, on the release of endogenous glutamate in rat cerebral cortex nerve terminals (synaptosomes) and exploring the possible mechanism. Tamoxifen inhibited the release of glutamate that was evoked by the K(+) channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and this phenomenon was concentration-dependent and insensitive to the estrogen receptor antagonist. The effect of tamoxifen on the evoked glutamate release was prevented by the chelating extracellular Ca(2+) ions, and by the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1. However, the glutamate transporter inhibitor dl-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate did not have any effect on the action of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen did not alter the resting synaptosomal membrane potential or 4-AP-mediated depolarization whereas it decreased the 4-AP-induced increase in cytosolic [Ca(2+)]. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on the evoked glutamate release was abolished by the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channel blocker \u03c9-conotoxin MVIIC, but not by the ryanodine receptor blocker dantrolene, or the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger blocker CGP37157. In addition, the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors GF109203X or Ro318220 prevented tamoxifen from inhibiting glutamate release. Western blotting showed that tamoxifen significantly decreased the 4-AP-induced phosphorylation of PKC and PKC\u03b1. Together, these results suggest that tamoxifen inhibits glutamate release from rat cortical synaptosomes, through the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca(2+) entry and PKC activity.", 
    "41": "Blood pressure (BP) characteristics, such as central aortic pressure and arterial stiffness, independently predict cardiovascular events. The effects of pharmacologically dissimilar \u03b2-blockers on these properties have not been fully elucidated. Patients with essential hypertension and without significant concomitant cardiovascular disease were randomly assigned to controlled-release carvedilol, force-titrated to 80 mg (n=22), or atenolol, force-titrated to 100 mg (n=19); each was given once daily for 4 weeks. Baseline characteristics were similar. At the end of week 4, atenolol and carvedilol reduced central and brachial systolic and diastolic BP to a similar extent. Central augmentation index was increased in atenolol-treated patients but not carvedilol-treated patients (atenolol 4.47% vs carvedilol -0.68%; P=.04). Mean augmented central aortic pressure increased slightly during atenolol treatment (+1.1 mm Hg) but decreased slightly during carvedilol treatment (-1.1 mm Hg), although the difference in these changes was not statistically significant (P=.23). Pulse pressure amplification was reduced more with atenolol at week 4 (atenolol -10.7% vs carvedilol -1.8%; P=.02). Therefore, we conclude that carvedilol results in more favorable pulse pressure amplification and augmentation index by increasing arterial compliance and reducing the magnitude of wave reflection, respectively, compared with atenolol.",

Intradermal injection of 100 \u03bcl of 100 \u03bcg/ml histamine and 10 mg/ml icatibant into the forearms of health volunteers caused wheal and flare responses of a similar magnitude which were reduced by cetirizine pretreatment by 49% and 41% (histamine) and 35% and 41% (icatibant). Studies in vitro showed that icatibant at 1 \u00d7 10(-4) and 1 \u00d7 10(-5) M caused significant (P < 0.05) histamine release from isolated human cutaneous mast cells. In conclusion, icatibant induces histamine-mediated wheal and flare responses that may be reduced in severity by prophylactic administration of an H(1)-antihistamine.", 
    "48": "The nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol is an effective therapy for infantile hemangiomas. Systemic propranolol therapy shows a rapid therapeutic effect with good drug tolerability. We report on the efficacy of local application of propranolol ointment in superficial hemangiomas of the skin. In our outpatient department, 45 children with 65 hemangiomas were treated with 1% propranolol in a hydrophilic ointment topically applied twice a day. Before start of treatment and at each visit, clinical photographs were taken. If ultrasound did not confirm occult deeper components, children were included in the study. Treatment in the proliferative phase within the first 6 months of life (including seven preterm infants) induced regression in 59% and cessation of growth in 26% of the hemangiomas. No response or proliferation of subcutaneous components was observed in 15%. Clinically, no side effects caused by the beta-receptor blocker were noticed. Treatment of two ulcerated hemangiomas of the perineal region twice using a flash lamp pulsed-dye laser and propranolol ointment in the surrounding lesion led to healing of the ulcers in 3 and 6 weeks, respectively. In six patients, topical therapy was started between the ages of 7 and 33 months. Even in these hemangiomas, improvement was obvious after 2 or 3 months. Propranolol administered topically in 1% ointment could have a beneficial effect on superficial hemangiomas of the skin. The treatment was well tolerated without side effects even in preterm infants and in children with numerous or large lesions.",

Propranolol and metoprolole have been used for headaches that consistently emerge during frequent sexual activity of any type. It is also known that topiramate is useful for treating migraines, but it is rarely used for other primary headaches. The role of topiramate in the treatment of headaches associated with sexual activity is unclear. Indomethacin and propranolol could not be used in our patient who, besides sexual activity-associated headaches, suffered from gastritis and diabetes mellitus. Thus, topiramate (50 mg/day) was used prophylactically, and sexual activity-associated headaches did not recur during 6 months of topiramate therapy. This is the first report of positive response to topiramate as prophylactic treatment against sexual activity-associated headaches when propranolol and indomethacin are contraindicated.",

    "54": "The inability to achieve 85% of the maximum predicted heart rate (MPHR) on dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is defined as chronotropic incompetence and is a predictor of major cardiac events after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The majority of patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) receive beta-blockers for the prevention of variceal bleeding. In these patients, it is impossible to determine whether chronotropic incompetence is secondary to cirrhosis-related autonomic dysfunction or is merely a beta-blocker effect. We evaluated the usefulness of the maximum achieved heart rate (MAHR) and the heart rate reserve (HRR) in the detection of chronotropic incompetence in ESLD patients on beta-blocker therapy before DSE. We also evaluated the usefulness of a new index, the modified heart rate reserve (MHRR), in diagnosing chronotropic incompetence and predicting major cardiovascular adverse events after OLT. The study population consisted of 284 ESLD patients. The mean values of MAHR (expressed as a percentage of 85% of MPHR) and HRR were significantly lower for patients on beta-blockers versus patients off beta-blockers [97.1% versus 101.6% (t = 5.01, P < 0.001) and 71.7% versus 77.3% (t = 4.03, P < 0.001), respectively], whereas the values of MHRR were similar in patients on beta-blockers and patients off beta-blockers [102.3% versus 102.1% (t = 0.04, P = 0.97)]. A regression analysis showed a significant association of MAHR (P < 0.001) and HRR (P < 0.001) with beta-blockers, whereas MHRR was not associated with beta-blocker treatment (P = 0.92). MAHR and HRR were found to have no value for diagnosing chronotropic incompetence in ESLD patients. MHRR was not affected by beta-blocker therapy. Patients who developed heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) after OLT had significantly lower MHRR values according to pretransplant DSE. MHRR was significantly associated with the subsequent development of HF (P = 0.01) and MI (P = 0.01) after OLT. MHRR may be useful for the determination of the target heart rate for stress testing, the diagnosis of chronotropic incompetence, and the prediction of adverse cardiac events after OLT.",

Clinical trials provide evidence that the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with HF. Furthermore, elevated D-dimer level is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality independent of AF in HF patients. We investigated whether plasma D-dimer levels in patients with hospitalized systolic HF could predict development of AF. A total of 150 consecutive patients with sinus rhythm who admitted to the emergency department with hospitalized systolic HF were evaluated. All hospitalized patients were obtained D-dimer levels within the first 24\u00a0h following admission. Atrial fibrillation developed in 31 (20.7%) patients during follow-up period of 6.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0months. Patients who developed atrial fibrillation had significantly increased levels of D-dimer [608 (339-1,022) ng/ml versus 1,100 (608-2,599) ng/ml, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001]. Optimal cut-off level of D-dimer to predict development of AF was found to be\u00a0>792\u00a0ng/ml. D-dimer\u00a0>792\u00a0ng/ml, right ventricular dilatation, age, systolic pulmonary pressure, left atrium size, moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and beta blocker usage were found to have prognostic significance in univariate analysis. In multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model, D-dimer levels\u00a0>792\u00a0ng/ml (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.019, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and right ventricular dilatation (HR\u00a0=\u00a08.676, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) were associated with an increased risk of new-onset AF.

By contrast, it is likely to be that some drugs such as loop-acting diuretics are harmful to bone, whereas evidence for harm caused by drugs such as warfarin is weaker.

    "69": "While glucose-stimulated insulin secretion depends on Ca(2+) influx through voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in the cell membrane of the pancreatic \u03b2-cell, there is also ample evidence for an important role of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in insulin secretion, particularly in relation to drug stimuli. We report here that thiopental, a common anesthetic agent, triggers insulin secretion from the intact pancreas and primary cultured rat pancreatic \u03b2-cells. We investigated the underlying mechanisms by measurements of whole cell K(+) and Ca(2+) currents, membrane potential, cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), and membrane capacitance. Thiopental-induced insulin secretion was first detected by enzyme-linked immunoassay, then further assessed by membrane capacitance measurement, which revealed kinetics distinct from glucose-induced insulin secretion. The thiopental-induced secretion was independent of cell membrane depolarization and closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels. However, accompanied by the insulin secretion stimulated by thiopental, we recorded a significant intracellular [Ca(2+)] increase that was not from Ca(2+) influx across the cell membrane, but from intracellular Ca(2+) stores. The thiopental-induced [Ca(2+)](i) rise in \u03b2-cells was sensitive to thapsigargin, a blocker of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump, as well as to heparin (0.1 mg/ml) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB; 100 \u03bcM), drugs that inhibit inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)) binding to the IP(3) receptor, and to U-73122, a phospholipase C inhibitor, but insensitive to ryanodine.

CSE expression was increased by anti-diabetic sulphonylureas, and decreased by the ATP-sensitive K(+)-channel opener diazoxide and the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker nitrendipine. Application of the synthetic inhibitors of protein kinases revealed the involvement of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in glucose- and thapsigargin-induced CSE expression. The CaMK II\u03b4 knockdown also suppressed CSE expression. Knockdown of the transcription factors Sp1 and Elk1, both of which can be phosphorylated by ERK, blunted CSE expression. By a reporter assay, we found Sp1 may directly and Elk1 may indirectly regulate CSE expression.

On 6- and 12-month echocardiographic evaluation, MR was seen to have improved in the vast majority of MR+ patients, while it remained unchanged in most MR- patients. On 12-month follow-up evaluation, a comparable response to CRT was observed in the two groups, in terms of the extent of left ventricular reverse remodeling and combined clinical and echocardiographic response. During long-term follow-up, event-free survival did not differ between MR+ and MR- patients, even when subpopulations of patients with ischemic heart disease and with dilated cardiomyopathy were analyzed separately. On multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of death from any cause was the lack of \u03b2-blocker use.",

    "102": "Sympathetic hyperactivity and parasympathetic insufficiency characterize blood pressure (BP) control in genetic hypertension. This shift is difficult to investigate in anesthetized rats. Here we present a pharmacological approach to simultaneously provoke sympathetic and parasympathetic transmitter release, and identify their respective roles in the concomitant cardiovascular response. To stimulate transmitter release in anesthetized normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we injected intravenously 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a voltage-sensitive K(+) channel (K(V)) inhibitor. A femoral artery catheter monitored BP, an ascending aorta flow-probe recorded cardiac output and heart rate (HR). Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) was calculated. 4-AP-induced an immediate, atropine (muscarinic antagonist)- and hexamethonium (ganglion blocker)-sensitive bradycardia in WKY, and in both strains, a subsequent, sustained tachycardia, and norepinephrine but not epinephrine release. Reserpine (sympatholytic), nadolol (\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist) or right vagal nerve stimulation eliminated the late tachycardia, adrenalectomy, scopolamine (central muscarinic antagonist) or hexamethonium did not. 4-AP increased TPVR, transiently in WKY but sustained in SHR. Yohimbine (\u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) prevented the TPVR down-regulation in WKY. Reserpine and prazosin (\u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist) eliminated the late vasoconstriction in SHR. Plasma epinephrine overflow increased in nadolol-treated SHR. Through inhibition of K(V), 4-AP activated parasympathetic ganglion transmission and peripheral, neuronal norepinephrine release. The sympathetic component dominated the 4-AP-HR-response in SHR. \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor-dependent vasodilatation opposed norepinephrine-induced \u03b1(1)-adrenergic vasoconstriction in WKY, but not SHR. A \u03b2AR-activated, probably vagal afferent mechanism, hampered epinephrine secretion in SHR. Thus, 4-AP activated the autonomic system and exposed mechanisms relevant to hypertensive disease.",

It has recently been shown that telmisartan might induce similar biochemical, biological, and metabolic changes (e.g., mitochondrial biogenesis and changes in skeletal muscle fiber type) as those reported for the former call of substances. We suspect that metabolic modulators abuse such as telmisartan might become a tangible threat in sports and should be thereby targeted as an important antidoping issue. The 2012 WADA prohibited list does not provide telmisartan for a potential doping drug, but arguments supporting the consideration to include them among \"metabolic modulators\" are at hand.",

In cases of pulmonary edema resulting from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) these effusions are exudative, having high protein load. To this end, the effect of salbutamol in the presence of protein, on the ion transport properties of the sheep parietal pleura was investigated by Ussing chamber experiments. Our results show that salbutamol increases ion transport in the presence of protein in sheep parietal pleura by stimulation of \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors since this effect was completely abolished by the specific \u03b2(2)-adrenergic blocker, ICI-118551.

During reconsolidation, memories become sensitive to psychological and pharmacological modifications again, thus providing an opportunity to alter unwanted memories. Although such reconsolidation manipulations might open the door to novel treatment approaches for psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, the brain mechanisms underlying reconsolidation processes in humans are completely unknown. Here, we asked whether a \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist might interfere with the reconsolidation of emotional episodic memories and what brain mechanisms are involved in these effects.",

This emotional memory impairment was associated with significantly increased activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus for correctly recognized pictures at test.

Memory reactivation alone or propranolol without reactivation had no effect on subsequent memory.",

    "113": "Peripheral amylin inhibits eating via the area postrema (AP). Because amylin activates the extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK) pathway in some tissues, and because ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) leads to acute neuronal responses, we postulated that it may be involved in amylin's eating inhibitory effect. Amylin-induced ERK phosphorylation (pERK) was investigated by immunohistochemistry in brain sections containing the AP. pERK-positive AP neurons were double-stained for the calcitonin 1a/b receptor, which is part of the functional amylin-receptor. AP sections were also phenotyped using dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH) as a marker of noradrenergic neurons. The effect of fourth ventricular administration of the ERK cascade blocker U0126 on amylin's eating inhibitory action was tested in feeding trials. The number of pERK-positive neurons in the AP was highest \u223c10-15 min after amylin treatment; the effect appeared to be dose-dependent (5-20 \u03bcg/kg amylin). A portion of pERK-positive neurons in the AP carried the amylin-receptor and 22% of the pERK-positive neurons were noradrenergic. Pretreatment of rats with U0126 decreased the number of pERK-positive neurons in the AP after amylin injection. U0126 also attenuated the ability of amylin to reduce eating, at least when the animals had been fasted 24 h prior to the feeding trial. Overall, our results suggest that amylin directly stimulates pERK in AP neurons in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Part of the AP neurons displaying pERK were noradrenergic. At least under fasting conditions, pERK was shown to be a necessary part in the signaling cascade mediating amylin's anorectic effect.",

    "115": "The migratory activity of tumor cells and their ability to extravasate from the blood stream through the vascular endothelium are important steps within the metastasis cascade. We have shown previously that norepinephrine is a potent inducer of the migration of MDA-MB-468 human breast carcinoma cells and therefore investigated herein, whether the interaction of these cells as well as MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435S human breast carcinoma cells with the vascular endothelium is affected by this neurotransmitter as well. By means of a flow-through assay under physiologic flow conditions, we show that norepinephrine induces an increase of the adhesion of the MDA-MB-231 cells, but not of MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435S cells to human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC). The adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells was based on a norepinephrine-mediated release of GRO\u03b1 from HMVECs. GRO\u03b1 caused a \u03b21-integrin-mediated increase of the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Most interestingly, this effect of norepinephrine, similar to the aforementioned induction of migration in MDA-MB-468 cells, was mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors and therefore abrogated by \u03b2-blockers. In conclusion, norepinephrine has cell line-specific effects with regard to certain steps of the metastasis cascade, which are conjointly inhibited by clinically established \u03b2-blockers. Therefore, these results may deliver a molecular explanation for our recently published retrospective data analysis of patients with breast cancer which shows that \u03b2-blockers significantly reduce the development of metastases.", 
    "116": "We have previously shown that chronic treatment with propranolol had beneficial effects on heart function in rats during increasing-age in a gender-dependent manner. Herein, we hypothesize that propranolol would improve cardiac function in diabetic cardiomyopathy and investigated the benefits of chronic oral administration of propranolol on the parameters of Ca(2+) signaling in the heart of streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Male diabetic rats received propranolol (25 mg/kg, daily) for 12 weeks, 1 week after diabetes induction. Treatment of the diabetic rats with propranolol did not produce a hypoglycaemic effect whereas it attenuated the increased cell size. Basal and \u03b2-agonist response levels of left ventricular developed pressure were significantly higher in propranolol-treated diabetic rats relative to untreated diabetics while left ventricular end diastolic pressure of the treated diabetics was comparable to the controls. Propranolol treatment normalized also the prolongation of the action potential in papillary muscles from the diabetic rat hearts. This treatment attenuated the parameters of Ca(2+) transients, depressed Ca(2+) loading of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and of the basal intracellular Ca(2+) level of diabetic cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, Western blot data indicated that the diabetes-induced alterations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channel's hyperphosphorylation decreased the FKBP12.6 protein level. Also, the high phosphorylated levels of PKA and CaMKII were prevented with propranolol treatment. Chronic treatment with propranolol seems to prevent diabetes-related changes in heart function by controlling intracellular Ca(2+) signaling and preventing the development of left ventricular remodeling in diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

In contrast, the inotropic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation was diminished in TGF-\u03b2\u2081-Tg mice, albeit unchanged basal contractility. Treatment with sTGF-\u03b2R-Fc completely prevented the cardiac phenotype in transgenic mice. Chronic \u03b2-blocker treatment also prevented hypertrophy and ANF induction by isoprenaline, and restored the inotropic response to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation without affecting TGF-\u03b2\u2081 levels, whereas AT\u2081-receptor blockade had no effect. The impaired contractile reserve in TGF-\u03b2\u2081-Tg mice was accompanied by an upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) which was reversed by \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade. UCP-inhibition restored the contractile response to \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Finally, cardiac TGF-\u03b2\u2081 and UCP expression were elevated in heart failure in humans, and UCP--but not TGF-\u03b2\u2081--was downregulated by \u03b2-blocker treatment.",

It is associated with major hemodynamic alterations characteristic of hyperdynamic circulation and with a series of structural, functional, electrophysiological and biological heart abnormalities termed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is multifactorial. It is usually clinically latent or mild, likely because the peripheral vasodilatation significantly reduces the left ventricle afterload. However, sudden changes of hemodynamic state (vascular filling, surgical or transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunts, peritoneo-venous shunts and orthotopic liver transplantation) or myocardial contractility (introduction of beta-blocker therapy) can unmask its presence, and sometimes convert latent to overt heart failure. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy may also contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatorenal syndrome. This entity has been described recently, and its diagnostic criteria are still under debate. To date, current management recommendations are empirical, nonspecific measures. Recognition of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy depends on a high level of awareness for the presence of this syndrome, particularly in patients with advanced cirrhosis who undergo significant surgical, pharmacological or physiological stresses.", 
    "148": "The natural processes occurring in subsurface environments have proven to effectively remove a number of organic pollutants from water. The predominant redox conditions revealed to be one of the controlling factors. However, in the case of organic micropollutants the knowledge on this potential redox-dependent behavior is still limited. Motivated by managed aquifer recharge practices microcosm experiments involving aquifer material, settings potentially feasible in field applications, and organic micropollutants at environmental concentrations were carried out. Different anaerobic redox conditions were promoted and sustained in each set of microcosms by adding adequate quantities of electron donors and acceptors. Whereas denitrification and sulfate-reducing conditions are easily achieved and maintained, Fe- and Mn-reduction are strongly constrained by the slower dissolution of the solid phases commonly present in aquifers. The thorough description and numerical modeling of the evolution of the experiments, including major and trace solutes and dissolution/precipitation of solid phases, have been proven necessary to the understanding of the processes and closing the mass balance. As an example of micropollutant results, the ubiquitous beta-blocker atenolol is completely removed in the experiments, the removal occurring faster under more advanced redox conditions. This suggests that aquifers constitute a potentially efficient alternative water treatment for atenolol, especially if adequate redox conditions are promoted during recharge and long enough residence times are ensured.", 
    "149": "Augmented hemodynamic load increases the risk of arrhythmogenesis by modulating cardiac repolarization duration. We hypothesized that the intervention on the autonomic tone may affect the load-dependent changes in ventricular repolarization. Activation-recovery intervals were measured in unipolar electrograms simultaneously recorded from 64 ventricular epicardial leads, in a total of 26 chinchilla rabbits in resting conditions, and after 1 and 10\u00a0min of aortic stenosis. Eleven animals were given atropine and propranolol before the loading. The short-term stenosis decreased the activation-recovery intervals in the right ventricle, whereas the prolonged overload increased the repolarization duration in both ventricles. The treatment with the \u03b2-adrenergic and M-cholinergic blockers prolonged the activation-recovery intervals, especially at the left ventricle, attenuating the apicobasal and interventricular gradients of repolarization duration seen in the baseline state. Further ventricular loading shortened the repolarization duration in both ventricles in animals with autonomic blockade. Thus, the autonomic tone was shown to be essential for the development of repolarization heterogeneity across the ventricles. The autonomic blockade transformed the biphasic changes of activation-recovery intervals into their monophasic shortening at aortic stenosis.", 
    "150": "Stress modulates instrumental action in favor of habit processes that encode the association between a response and preceding stimuli and at the expense of goal-directed processes that learn the association between an action and the motivational value of the outcome. Here, we asked whether this stress-induced shift from goal-directed to habit action is dependent on noradrenergic activation and may therefore be blocked by a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist. To this end, healthy men and women were administered a placebo or the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol before they underwent a stress or a control procedure. Shortly after the stress or control procedure, participants were trained in two instrumental actions that led to two distinct food outcomes. After training, one of the food outcomes was selectively devalued by feeding participants to satiety with that food. A subsequent extinction test indicated whether instrumental behavior was goal-directed or habitual. As expected, stress after placebo rendered participants' behavior insensitive to the change in the value of the outcome and thus habitual. After propranolol intake, however, stressed participants behaved, same as controls, goal-directed, suggesting that propranolol blocked the stress-induced bias toward habit behavior. Our findings show that the shift from goal-directed to habitual control of instrumental action under stress necessitates noradrenergic activation and could have important clinical implications, particularly for addictive disorders.",

In vivo studies were performed on New Zealand white rabbits by administering the microspheres intranasally using monodose nasal insufflator. The radioactivity was measured in a well-type gamma scintillation counter. The noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. The pattern of deposition and clearance of the microspheres were evaluated using a radioactive tracer and the noninvasive technique of gamma scintigraphy. The clearance of alginate microsphere was compared with that of control lactose. The microspheres were nonaggregated, free flowing powders with spherical shape, and smooth surface. Pharmacokinetics study displayed an increase in area under the curve and hence in relative bioavailability when compared with intravenous administration of drug. The nasal bioavailability was 67.87% which indicates that nasal administration results in improved absorption of CRV. The results of gamma scintigraphy showed that the alginate microspheres had significantly reduced rates of clearance from the rabbit nasal cavity when compared with the control lactose.",

(2) Tight control of BP levels < 130/85 mmHg is recommended in general hypertensive patients. More tight control is recommended in patients with DM, CKD, and post MI : BP < 130/80 mmHg. (3) Final target of BP in the elderly is < 140/90 mmHg. However BP should be reduced carefully by setting an intermediate target of < 150/90 mmHg in patients with 75 yrs or over. (4) BP control over 24 hours and usefulness of home BP measurement are stressed. Masked hypertension, morning surge, night-time hypertension, and sleep apnea syndrome are particularly important issues. (5) CCB, ARB, ACE inhibitor, diuretic, and beta-blocker are recommended as initial antihypertensive drugs, combination therapy such as ARB+diuretics or CCB are often necessary to achieve BP target.

Changes in left ventricular fraction-shortening (LVFS) and heart rate (HR) were observed at 5-min after DPDPE infusion. At 5-min DPDPE induced a 36 \u00b1 18% (p<0.001) increase of the LVFS, which continues to increase to 51 \u00b1 24% (p<0.0001) by 10 min, and 68 \u00b1 19% (p<0.001) by 20 min.

In management of AF, a brief trial of rate-control agents is appropriate; however, chemical cardioversion with rhythm-control agents should be instituted after 24 hours.

This includes cardioprotective medical interventions, for example with \u03b2-receptor blockers and statins. Current guidelines recommend that patients who are on \u03b2-receptor blockers or statins for chronic treatment of cardiovascular diseases should continue this medication throughout the perioperative period. Myocardial conditioning has been assessed to be effective under numerous experimental conditions and clinical trials have also provided evidence for myocardial protection by conditioning. Besides ischemic and anesthetic-induced preconditioning the noninvasive technique of remote preconditioning offers interesting possibilities, especially for patients with serious comorbidities; however, large scale randomized clinical multicentre trials are still needed. Regarding cardioprotective effectiveness, the clinical data for regional anesthesia are very heterogeneous; nevertheless regional anesthesia is very effective in postoperative pain therapy.

Evidence suggests that \u03b2-adrenergic receptor sensitivity in the peripheral vasculature differs between sexes. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine whether \u03b2-adrenergic blockade alters aortic wave reflection to a similar extent in young men and women. In 31 subjects (16 men and 15 women; 26\u00b11 years) noninvasive aortic pressure waveforms were synthesized from high-fidelity radial pressure waveforms via applanation tonometry before and during systemic \u03b2-blockade (0.25 mg/kg bolus, followed by 0.004 mg/kg per minute of continuous infusion of propranolol). \u03b2-Blockade increased aortic augmentation index and wave reflection amplitude (aortic augmented pressure) in both sexes (P<0.01).

    "181": "Presenilins (PS1 and PS2) are multifunctional proteins involved in a diverse array of molecular and cellular functions, including proteolysis, development, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, ion channel regulation and phospholipid metabolism. Mutations in presenilin genes are responsible for the majority of Familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). Consequently, FAD-associated mutations in genes encoding PS1 or PS2 lead to several key cellular phenotypes, including alterations in proteolysis of \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Ca(2+) entry. The mechanism underlying presenilin (PS)-mediated modulation of Ca(2+) entry remains to be determined. Our previous studies showed that the PS-dependent down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is attributable to the observed Ca(2+) deficits. In this study, we attempted to identify the ion channel that is subject to the PIP2 and PS-dependent modulation. We found that Ca(2+) or Zn(2+) entry via the transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channel was attenuated by the presence of FAD-associated PS1 mutants, such as \u0394E9 and L286V. TRPM7 has been implicated in Mg(2+) homeostasis and embryonic development. The intracellular delivery of PIP2 restored TRPM7-mediated Ca(2+) influx, indicating that the observed deficits in Ca(2+) entry are due to downregulation of PIP2. Conversely, PS1 and PS2 deficiency, previously shown to upregulate PIP2 levels, potentiated TRPM7-mediated Ca(2+) influx. PS-dependent changes in Ca(2+) influx could be neutralized by a TRPM7 channel blocker. Collectively, these results indicate that TRPM7 may underlie the Ca(2+) entry deficits observed in FAD-associated PS mutants and suggest that the normal function of PS involves regulation of TRPM7 through a PIP2-dependent mechanism.", 
    "182": "Herein we introduce deep UV fluorescence lifetime detection in microfluidics applied for label-free detection and identification of various aromatic analytes in chip electrophoresis. For this purpose, a frequency quadrupled Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) picosecond laser at 266\u2009 nm was incorporated into an inverse fluorescence microscope setup with time-correlated single photon counting detection. This allowed recording of photon timing with sub-nanosecond precision. Thereby fluorescence decay curves are gathered on-the-fly and average lifetimes can be determined for each substance in the electropherogram. The aromatic compounds serotonin, propranolol, 3-phenoxy-1,2-propanediol and tryptophan were electrophoretically separated using a fused-silica microchip. Average lifetimes were independently determined for each compound via bi-exponential tail fitting. Time-correlated single photon counting also allows the discrimination of background fluorescence in the time domain. This results in improved signal-to-noise-ratios as demonstrated for the above model analytes. Microchip electrophoretic separations with fluorescence lifetime detection were also performed with a protein mixture containing lysozyme, trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen emphasizing the potential for biopolymer analysis.",

Esmolol, rather than nicardipine, increased minimal lumen diameter (P= 0.040), prolonged SFT (0.34 \u00b1 0.03 s vs. 0.41 \u00b1 0.03 s, P < 0.001), reduced DCP (P < 0.001) and increased blood velocity (33.65 \u00b1 1.07 cm/s vs. 43.36 \u00b1 1.25 cm/s, P < 0.001) at SFT stages, with increased blood-flow (P < 0.001). Both drugs increased downstream ESS. Esmolol significantly reversed abnormally increased ESS (P < 0.001) and increased upstream ESS compared with nicardipine (P < 0.001).", 
    "194": "Beyond a similar reduction of AP, patients with UA and MCS could benefit more from the reduction of heart rate induced by esmolol (ChiCTR-TRC-10000964).", 
    "195": "Asthmatic exacerbations are sometimes triggered by medications, primarily the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) and beta-blockers. Asthma attacks induced by NSAIDS occur rapidly and can be severe. Widal syndrome is a specific disease entity whose physiopathology remains incompletely explained. Asthma is characteristically severe and steroid dependent; desensitisation with aspirin has been proposed, but this remains controversial. Beta-blockers are contra-indicated in asthma; the \u03b21 \"cardioselectivity\" of some agents is not absolute, disappearing at high doses and the \"partial agonists\" are not better tolerated. However, certain authors have called into question the harmful effect of beta-blockade in moderate and stable asthma. More studies are needed, but the current data suggest that in some cases beta-blockers may be safe but their use requires close supervision. Other molecules can pose problems in asthmatics (dipyridamole, synthetic sex hormones and certain excipients). On the whole, there has been little innovation concerning the hazard that drugs can pose for some asthmatics. The task for the future will be to specify the physiopathology of Widal syndrome, and to clarify the categories of patients in whom beta-blockers can be safely employed as the public health consequences of cardiovascular pathologies make this an important issue for lung specialists."
