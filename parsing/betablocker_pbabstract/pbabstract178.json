    "0": "Two recent systematic reviews found first-line beta-blockers to be less effective in reducing the incidence of stroke and the combined endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death compared to all other antihypertensive drugs taken together. However, beta-blockers might be better or worse than a specific class of drugs for a particular outcome measure so that comparing beta-blockers with all other classes taken together could be misleading. In addition, these systematic reviews did not assess the tolerability of beta-blockers relative to other antihypertensive medications. We thus undertook this review to re-assess the place of beta-blockade as first-line therapy for hypertension relative to each of the other major classes of antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "1": "To quantify the effectiveness and safety of beta-blockers on morbidity and mortality endpoints in adults with hypertension.", 
    "2": "We searched eligible studies up to June 2006 in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase, and reference lists of previous reviews, and by contacting hypertension experts.", 
    "3": "We selected randomised controlled trials which assessed the effectiveness of beta-blockers compared to placebo, no therapy or other drug classes, as monotherapy or first-line therapy for hypertension, on mortality and morbidity endpoints in men and non-pregnant women aged 18 years or older.", 
    "4": "At least two authors independently applied study selection criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data; with differences resolved by consensus. We expressed study results as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and conducted quantitative analyses with trial participants in groups to which they were randomly allocated, regardless of which or how much treatment they actually received. In the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (p>0.1), we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects method. Otherwise, we used the random effects method and investigated the cause of heterogeneity by stratified analysis. In addition, we used the Higgins statistic (I(2)) to quantify the amount of between-study variability in effect attributable to true heterogeneity rather than chance.", 
    "5": "Thirteen randomised controlled trials (N=91,561 participants), which met our inclusion criteria, compared beta-blockers to placebo or no treatment (4 trials with 23,613 participants), diuretics (5 trials with 18,241 participants), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs: 4 trials with 44,825 participants), and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (3 trials with 10,828 participants). The risk of all-cause mortality was not different between first-line beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.11, I(2)=0%), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.14, I(2)=2.2%; ARI=0.5%, NNH=200). The risk of total cardiovascular disease (CVD) was lower for first-line beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95%CI 0.79 to 0.97, I(2)=21.4%, ARR=0.7%, NNT=140). This is primarily a reflection of the significant decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95%CI 0.66 to 0.96; I(2)=0%; ARR=0.5%, NNT=200); coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was not significantly different between beta-blockers and placebo. The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was significantly worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95%CI 1.08 to 1.29, I(2)=0%; ARI=1.3%, NNH=80), but was not significantly different from that of diuretics or RAS inhibitors. Increased total CVD was due to an increase in stroke compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.40, I(2)=0%; ARI=0.6%, NNH=180). There was also an increase in stroke with beta-blockers as compared to RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.53, I(2)=29.1%; ARI=1.5%, NNH=65). CHD was not significantly different between beta-blockers and diuretics or CCBs or RAS inhibitors. In addition, patients on beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to side effects than those on diuretics (RR 1.86, 95%CI 1.39 to 2.50, I(2)=78.2%, ARI=6.4% NNH=16) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95%CI 1.29 to 1.54, I(2)=12.1%; ARI=5.5%, NNH=18), but there was no significant difference with CCBs.", 
    "6": "The available evidence does not support the use of beta-blockers as first-line drugs in the treatment of hypertension. This conclusion is based on the relatively weak effect of beta-blockers to reduce stroke and the absence of an effect on coronary heart disease when compared to placebo or no treatment. More importantly, it is based on the trend towards worse outcomes in comparison with calcium-channel blockers, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics. Most of the evidence for these conclusions comes from trials where atenolol was the beta-blocker used (75% of beta-blocker participants in this review). However, it is not known at present whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and elderly patients or whether there are differences between the different sub-types of beta-blockers.", 
    "7": "To determine whether diabetes leads to retinal neuronal dysfunction in hypertensive transgenic (mRen-2)27 rats (Ren-2), and whether the effect can be prevented by treatment of hypertension with either the angiotensin-1 receptor blocker (AT1-RB) valsartan or the beta1-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol.", 
    "8": "Six-week-old Ren-2 rats were made diabetic (streptozotocin 55 mg/kg; n = 34) or remained nondiabetic (0.1 M citrate buffer; n = 43) and studied for 20 weeks. A subset of animals received valsartan (4 mg/kg per day) or atenolol (30 mg/kg per day) by gavage. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats served as normotensive controls for blood pressure (BP). We evaluated retinal function in all groups with a paired-flash electroretinogram over high light intensities (0.5-2.0 log cd-s . m(-2)), to isolate rod and cone responses.", 
    "9": "A reduction in amplitude of all electroretinogram components (PIII, PII, OPs, cone PII) was found in nondiabetic Ren-2 compared with nondiabetic SD rats. A further reduction was observed in diabetic Ren-2 rats. Treatment of both nondiabetic and diabetic Ren-2 rats with valsartan or atenolol reduced BP to within normal limits. This reduction produced some improvement in function in treated nondiabetic Ren-2 rats. However, in treated diabetic Ren-2 rats, retinal dysfunction was ameliorated by valsartan but not by atenolol, with a significant improvement (P < 0.05) observed in all components of the electroretinogram, with the exception of the OPs.", 
    "10": "These findings suggest that hypertension induces retinal dysfunction that is exacerbated with diabetes and ameliorated by treatment with an AT1-RB, and not just by normalizing BP. These data provide further evidence for the importance of the renin-angiotensin system in development of diabetic complications.", 
    "11": "1. The present study addressed possible changes in the dissociation constant of metoprolol and its inverse agonist activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In addition, a possible correlation between cardiac hypertrophy and the inverse agonist activity of metoprolol was explored. 2. In order to determine the dissociation constant (expressed as the pKb) of metoprolol, a cumulative concentration-response curve to noradrenaline was constructed in the absence or presence of metoprolol (0.1, 1 or 10 micromol/L). In a second experiment, a cumulative concentration-response curve to metoprolol was constructed to determine its inverse agonist activity. 3. The ventricular weight of SHR was significantly greater compared with Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. A rightward shift of the concentration-response curve to noradrenaline was observed in SHR compared with WKY rats. The pKb of metoprolol was smaller in SHR compared with WKY rats (6.35 +/- 0.14 vs 6.99 +/- 0.12, respectively; P < 0.05). No difference was observed in the maximal response (Emax) of the concentration-time effect of metoprolol in WKY rats and SHR (-29.1 +/- 7.1 vs-28.2 +/- 8.5%, respectively; n = 6 for both). However, the concentration of metoprolol eliciting a half-maximal effect (expressed as the pEC50) was significantly smaller in SHR compared with WKY rats (4.82 +/- 0.07 vs 5.29 +/- 0.13, respectively; n = 6; P < 0.05). Although a significant correlation (r = -0.876) between the ventricular weight/bodyweight (VW/BW) ratio and the pEC50 of the chronotropic effect of metoprolol was found, no relationship (r = -0.257) was found between the VW/BW ratio and Emax. 4. In summary, the present study provides the first evidence of a change in the in vitro pharmacodynamic properties of metoprolol in SHR. The sympathetic overactivity present in SHR not only reduces the positive chronotropic effect of noradrenaline, but also diminishes the constant dissociation of metoprolol from atrial beta1-adrenoceptors and its inverse agonist activity. A significant correlation between the VW/BW ratio and the inverse agonist potency of metoprolol was found, suggesting a possible link between cardiac hypertrophy and the reduction of the inverse agonist activity of metoprolol.", 
    "12": "Binding assays still form a fundamental part of modern drug development. Receptor binding assays are mostly based on radioactivity because of their speed, ease of use and reproducibility. Disadvantages, such as health hazards and production of radioactive waste, have prompted the development of non-radioactive receptor binding assays. This application therefore focuses on measuring receptor-ligand interactions using mass spectrometry. Moreover, the novelty of this approach originates in determining multiple analytes in a single assay (multiplexing). The proof of principle of a non-radioactive multiplex receptor assay is demonstrated using a pool of receptors from rat cortical tissue with flunitrazepam, MADAM and pindolol in one vial with or without their respective displacers. Flunitrazepam, MADAM and pindolol bound specifically at 73%, 30% and 40% to their respective receptors. This corresponds to specific binding sites of 0.61 pmol/mg protein, 0.07 pmol/mg protein and 0.06 pmol/mg protein, respectively. We propose to measure the bound fraction instead of the free fraction in order to reach a significant difference in measured signals (total binding versus non-specific binding). The bound fraction can be obtained after dissociating the ligand from the receptor-ligand complex using 50% methanol in water. The current setup of the assay calls for further improvement with respect to the measurement of binding constants for a multitude of receptors in one assay with sufficient accuracy and precision.", 
    "13": "Although addiction to amphetamine (AMPH) is a serious social and medical problem, the data concerning AMPH - immune interactions are still not numerous. To analyze the mechanism of AMPH-induced changes in the function of the immune system, rats were pretreated with beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (PROP; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to AMPH (1 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. Natural Killer cells cytotoxicity (NKCC) ((51)Cr-release assay), the number of LGLs (NK cells) (Timonen method), leukocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, and plasma corticosterone level (CORT) (RIA) were evaluated in the peripheral blood and spleen. In the peripheral blood increases in NKCC (+331 Delta %), as well as in LGL (+33 Delta %) and monocyte (+65 Delta %) number observed after AMPH were partially inhibited by PROP (respectively by 30%, 19%, and 30%) in contrast to lymphopenia (-19 Delta %) and granulocytosis (+65 Delta %) which were not affected by beta-blockade. In the spleen AMPH-induced decreases in NKCC (-25 Delta %) and in all the leukocyte populations number (approximately -30 Delta %) were completely blocked by PROP. Plasma CORT level, highly elevated by AMPH (+337 Delta %), was attenuated nearly by 50% under beta-adrenergic blockade. These data indicate that AMPH-induced enhancement of cytotoxic activity of NK cell is related to beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "14": "Orexin A influences the central cardiovascular regulation, since after intracerebroventricular (icv) administration it evokes short-lasting increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in normotensive animals. The aim of the present study was to examine haemodynamic effects of orexin A in haemorrhage-shocked rats. Experiments were carried out in anaesthetized Wistar rats subjected for a critical irreversible haemorrhagic hypotension of 20-25 mmHg, which resulted in the death of all saline icv-treated control animals within 30 min. Orexin A (0.5-1.5 nmol; icv) administered at 5 min of critical hypotension evoked dose-dependent long-lasting increases in MAP, HR and renal, mesenteric and hindquarters blood flows, with a 100% survival of 2 h after treatment (1.5 nmol; icv). Changes in MAP and peripheral haemodynamics were inhibited by intravenous pretreatment with alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (0.5 mg/kg) and yohimbine (1.0 mg/kg), respectively. Moreover, both antagonists significantly decreased the survival rate to 16.6 and 33.3% (P<0.05 vs. orexin A [1.5 nmol]-treated group). In contrast, beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1.0 mg/kg) completely blocked orexin A-induced HR changes, without influence on MAP, peripheral blood flows and the survival rate. Therefore, we conclude that centrally acting orexin A evokes the resuscitating effect in haemorrhage-shocked rats due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "15": "In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.",

    "17": "A sample of 65 patients with a diagnosis of POAG or ocular hypertension were randomized to receive either bimatoprost 0.03% once daily or timolol-dorzolamide combination twice daily. Study visits occurred at baseline and after 2 weeks and 1, 3 and 6 months of therapy. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed at 12.00 hours at all study visits and also at 08.00 hours and 16.00 hours at baseline and 6-month visits. At each visit, local and systemic side-effects that occurred during the treatment period were recorded. Student's t-test was used to compare the differences between IOP values.", 
    "18": "Differences in IOP between the bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide groups were statistically insignificant at all study visits (p > 0.05). In the bimatoprost-treated group, the IOP reduction was 6.2 +/- 1.8 mmHg, whereas it was 6.5 +/- 2.3 mmHg in the timolol-dorzolamide group after 6 months of treatment. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.48).", 
    "19": "The IOP-lowering efficacies of bimatoprost and timolol-dorzolamide combination were similar over a 6-month follow-up. Both bimatoprost and the timolol-dorzolamide combination were well tolerated. Bimatoprost can be used as a longterm monotherapy agent in the treatment of POAG and ocular hypertension.", 
    "20": "The bone response to physical exercise may be under control of the SNS. Using a running session in rats, we confirmed that exercise improved trabecular and cortical properties. SNS blockade by propranolol did not affect this response on cortical bone but surprisingly inhibited the trabecular response. This suggests that the SNS is involved in the trabecular response to exercise but not in the cortical response.", 
    "21": "Animal studies have suggested that bone remodeling is under beta-adrenergic control through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). However, the SNS contribution to bone response under mechanical loading remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the preventive effect of exercise coupled with propranolol on cancellous and cortical bone compartments in ovariectomized rats.", 
    "22": "Six-month-old female Wistar rats were ovariectomized (OVX, n = 44) or sham-operated (n = 24). OVX rats received subcutaneous injections of propranolol 0.1 mg/kg/day or vehicle and were submitted or not submitted to treadmill exercise (13 m/minute, 60 minutes/day, 5 days/week) for 10 weeks. Tibial and femoral BMD was analyzed longitudinally by DXA. At death, the left tibial metaphysis and L(4) vertebrae were removed, and microCT was performed to study trabecular and cortical bone structure. Histomorphometric analysis was performed on the right proximal tibia.", 
    "23": "After 10 weeks, BMD and trabecular strength decreased in OVX rats, whereas bone turnover rate and cortical porosity increased compared with the Sham group (p < 0.001). Either propranolol or exercise allowed preservation of bone architecture by increasing trabecular number (+50.35% versus OVX; p < 0.001) and thickness (+16.8% versus OVX; p < 0.001). An additive effect of propranolol and exercise was observed on cortical porosity but not on trabecular microarchitecture or cortical width. Biomechanical properties indicated a higher ultimate force in the OVX-propranolol-exercise group compared with the OVX group (+9.9%; p < 0.05), whereas propranolol and exercise alone did not have any significant effect on bone strength.",

    "25": "We examined whether lactate availability is a limiting factor for heart function during endotoxic shock, and whether lactate deprivation thus induces heart energy depletion, thereby altering cardiovascular performance. The study goals were to determine whether muscle lactate production is linked to beta(2)-stimulation and to ascertain the effects of systemic lactate deprivation on hemodynamics, lactate metabolism, heart energetics, and outcome in a lethal model of rat's endotoxic shock.", 
    "26": "We modulated the adrenergic pathway in skeletal muscle using microdialysis with ICI-118551, a selective beta(2)-blocker. Muscle lactate formation in endotoxic shock was further inhibited by intravenous infusion of ICI-118551 or dichloroacetate (DCA), an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase (DCA) and their combination.", 
    "27": "Muscle lactate formation was decreased by ICI-118551. During endotoxic shock both ICI-118151 and DCA decreased circulating and heart lactate concentrations in parallel with a decrease in tissue ATP content. The combination ICI-118551-DCA resulted in early cardiovascular collapse and death. The addition of molar lactate to ICI-1185111 plus DCA blunted the effects of ICI-118551+DCA on hemodynamics. Survival was markedly less with ICI-118551 than with endotoxin alone.", 
    "28": "Systemic lactate deprivation is detrimental to myocardial energetics, cardiovascular performance, and outcome.", 
    "29": "The pathogenesis of glaucomatic illnesses is poorly understood. An increase in ocular pressure can be caused by an increase in the secretion of aqueous humour or a reduction in its outflow. In the elderly, outflow is reduced while at the same time less aqueous humour is produced. This balance is easily disturbed, so that age represents a risk factor for glaucoma in addition to increased ocular pressure. Therapeutic possibilities involve, on the one hand, reducing the secretion of aqueous humour, for example using, beta blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and clonidine. On the other hand, aqueous humour outflow can also be influenced by drugs. Conventional outflow is increased by the administration of miotics. The uveoscleral outflow can be increased by prostaglandin derivates. Drugs which only influence trabecular outflow are not yet available. Future therapeutic possibilities involve new aspects of the pathophysiology, e.c. the use of growth factors, free radical scavenging enzymes and choroidal blood flow.", 
    "30": "Twenty five Holstein-Friesian heifers, clinically normal and with regular oestrous cycles, were used for induction of superovulation (PMSG-PGF(2)alpha-Neutra-PMSG). Animals were divided into 5 groups receiving: I - detomidine (40 microg/kg b.w.), II - doxazosin (0.2 mg/kg b.w.), III - yohimbine HCL 1% (1 ml/50 kg b.w.), IV - carazolol (0.01 mg/ kg b.w., i.v.), and V - physiological saline (1 ml/50 kg b.w.). The heifers with PGF2 alpha-induced cycles were treated with the substances 88 hrs after being given a single i.m. injection of 2500 IU PMSG. All animals were examined by ultrasonography, and by the number and size of ovarian follicles > 3 mm in diameter. The follicles were divided into 3 groups according to the diameter. Blood plasma was stored at -20 degrees C until LH, P4, E2 and PGFM analyses. In the control (V) group, two waves of follicle growth were observed. Yohimbine produced a significant blockage of ovulation. The mean number of corpora lutea in the group III was significantly lower than that in the control group (p< 0.02). No significant differences in the number of corpora lutea were observed between the groups I, II and III. The increase in E2 concentrations could be the response to the PMSG treatment with two waves of growth of large follicles before and after ovulation. Pulsatile LH release was altered by yohimbinum injection, however, the greater amplitude of pulses immediately following yohimbinum administration are suggestive of a positive influence of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors antagonist. Yohimbinum administration did not affect plasma concentration of examined hormones. There was a difference between the plasma levels of LH after the doxazosin injection. Single injection of the stimulators and blockers of adrenergic receptors did not affect superovulatory response in terms of the numbers of CL, unruptured follicles and embryos recovered. The affectivity of artificial insemination was not significantly different between the control group and the detomidinum groups, while in the yohimbinum group it was significantly lower.", 
    "31": "The aim of this study was to determine the influence of alpha- and beta-stimulators (alpha-stimulator: detomidinum HCl) as well as blockers (alpha1-blocker: doxazosin, alpha2-blocker: yohimbinum HCL, beta-blocker: carazolol) on bovine granulosa cells culture from preovulatory follicles. The cell culture was passed in TCM 199 medium with 10% FCS and antibiotics. Tested substances were added to the culture medium in different concentrations. The experiment began when at least 80% of the wells were covered (in four well culture dish of NUNCK-DK). The culture medium was collected every 24 h for hormone analysis. Hormone levels of T, E2, and P4 were determined. The culture was used up to 120 hours. Our results showed a decrease in P-4 secretion after detomidinum addition for all tested concentrations. A slight testosterone level increase was seen in the first 24 hours and then its concentration remained at a constant low level. A slight increase in 17-beta estradiol secretion was also observed. After yohimbinum addition, a statistically significant decrease of progesterone was observed for all concentrations tested. No significant changes were observed at other hormones levels when compared with the control. Doxazosin, when added into the culture medium, did not cause any statistically significant changes in hormone secretions. The addition of carazolol caused a significant decrease in progesterone secretion after culturing for 48 hours. Changes observed in other hormones levels did not differ statistically from the control. These results seem to support the hypothesis that drugs stimulating and blocking adrenergic receptors may play some role in ovarian steroidogenesis in cows.",

Their age-matched nondiabetic littermates db/m mice were treated with placebo and acted as nondiabetic controls. After 6 weeks' treatment, an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, immunohistochemical staining of oxidative stress markers, insulin, CD31, azan staining and an electron microscopy observation were performed.", 
    "34": "Chronic candesartan treatment provided an improvement of glucose tolerance, and greatly rescued islet beta-cell mass. Candesartan treatment also notably decreased staining intensity of oxidative stress markers, as well as attenuating intra-islet fibrosis and improving blood supply in the islet. In the electron microscopy observation, candesartan-treated animals exhibited improved granulation and less remarkable endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies; furthermore, candesartan treatment greatly relieved the swelling of mitochondria to nearly normal. Both the benefits of reducing oxidative stress and ultrastructure protection were in a dose-dependent and blood pressure-independent manner.", 
    "35": "After diabetes was initiated, candesartan treatment could not reverse the state of diabetes, but it effectively improved glucose tolerance and protected beta-cell function by attenuating oxidative stress, islet fibrosis, sparsity of blood supply and ultrastructure disruption in a dose-dependent and blood pressure-independent manner.",

Asthma seems particularly widespread in winter-sport athletes such as cross-country skiers. Asthmatic athletes commonly use inhaled beta(2)-agonists to prevent and treat asthmatic symptoms. However, beta(2)-agonists are prohibited according to the Prohibited List of the World Anti-Doping Agency. An exception can be made only for the substances formoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol and terbutaline by inhalation, as long as a therapeutic use exemption has been applied for and granted. In this context, the question arises of whether beta(2)-agonists have ergogenic benefits justifying the prohibition of these substances. In 17 of 19 randomised placebo-controlled trials in non-asthmatic competitive athletes, performance-enhancing effects of the inhaled beta(2)-agonists formoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol and terbutaline could not be proved. This is particularly true for endurance performance, anaerobic power and strength performance. In three of four studies, even supratherapeutic doses of salbutamol (800-1200 microg) had no ergogenic effect. In contrast to inhaled beta(2)-agonists, oral administration of salbutamol seems to be able to improve the muscle strength and the endurance performance. There appears to be no justification to prohibit inhaled beta(2)-agonists from the point of view of the ergogenic effects.", 
    "47": "Evidence-based heart failure management now includes beta-blockers and spironolactone in addition to diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aim to determine if these recommendations had been applied in practice for acute and chronic stable heart failure, and what difficulties there might be. Data from 80 consecutive patients hospitalized for decompensated heart failure ('acute') between May and July 2003 were analyzed at admission, upon discharge and at 12 weeks follow-up; along with 74 cardiology clinic out-patients with stable congestive heart failure ('chronic'- no decompensation or admission in previous six months). Less than half of study patients with prior left ventricular dysfunction were on ACE-inhibitors (47%), diuretics (39%), ATII antagonists, spironolactone or digoxin (5% each). All 'acute' patients were commenced on diuretics and ACE-inhibitors in hospital. Six patients died or transferred to another center. Compliance with clinic appointment at 12 weeks was 85% despite telephone reminders. Drug prescription at 12 weeks was significantly lower for diuretics and ACE-inhibitors compared to prescription at discharge (all p < 0.05) but higher compared to patients with chronic HF. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors remain under-utilized for patients with recurrent heart failure. Use of spironolactone and beta-blocker is slow due to limited medical experience and funding. Clinic non-attendance is significant and due to patient factors.", 
    "48": "Immobilized amyloglucosidase was used as a chiral stationary phase (CSP). First, the retention and enantioselectivity of several model chiral amines and acids were investigated. We found that this CSP was unable to separate the enantiomers of acids, though all selected amines could be resolved. The adsorption of (R)- and (S)-propranolol and its influence on column temperature and 2-propanol content in the eluent were then studied in detail, using a three-step methodology. The adsorption was first evaluated using Scatchard plots; thereafter, the adsorption was characterized in detail by calculating the adsorption energy distribution. With this model-independent information, a better judgment could be made of the possible adsorption models selected in the last step, the model fitting to the data. In the case examined, the bi-Langmuir model (containing nonselective and enantioselective sites) describes the system well. The retention of (R)- and (S)-propranolol at low temperatures increases with the content of 2-propanol in the eluent, due to the increased saturation capacity of the enantioselective sites. The retention is an enthalpy-driven process at both types of sites, whereas the enantioseparation is due to differences between the entropy changes of the two enantiomers at the enantioselective sites. The enthalpy of adsorption at the nonselective sites is almost identical at the two concentrations of 2-propanol in the eluent. Enantioselective adsorption, on the other hand, is more exothermic at higher modifier content (20%). Thus, at high temperatures the retention decreases with increasing modifier content, whereas the opposite (unusual) trend is the case at low temperatures.",

The inhibitory effects of several types of beta-AR antagonists on noradrenaline-induced relaxation against histamine contraction were scrutinized with Schild plot analysis. The concentration-response curve for noradrenaline obtained in the absence of phentolamine and uptake inhibitors was competitively antagonized by all of the beta-AR antagonists used in this study (propranolol, bupranolol, atenolol, butoxamine and ICI-118,551). However, their pA2 values were markedly less than the expected values for beta1-AR and beta2-AR. On the other hand, pA2 values of ICI-118,551 (6.85) determined in the presence of phentolamine suggested a contribution of a beta1 -AR rather than beta2 -AR. In the presence of phentolamine and uptake inhibitors (desipramine and deoxycorticosterone), the Schild plot for atenolol was a better fit, with two distinct straight lines. The pA2 values of atenolol provided by the regression were: approximately 7.0, which corresponds to the expected beta1-AR value, and approximately 6.5, which was 3 times less than the expected value for beta1 -AR, and thus the possible presence of two classes of beta1 -AR (beta1(Low) and beta1(High)) was suggested. This view was also supported by Schild plot analysis for propranolol, which fit two straight lines each with a slope of 1.0. The present findings indicate that beta1 -ARs contributing to noradrenaline-elicited relaxation in guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle exhibit diverse pharmacological characteristics and may be subdivided into at least two classes with distinct affinities for atenolol. Under physiological conditions, beta1(Low) rather than beta1(High) seems to play a more significant role in noradrenaline-regulated airway smooth muscle tone.", 
    "68": "The Working Group on Heart Failure of the Norwegian Society of Cardiology here presents a revised programme for the treatment of congestive heart failure. Possible surgical and percutaneous interventions should be considered, and non- pharmacological measures taken as indicated for each patient. ACE-inhibitors are the first-line pharmacological therapy in heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 40%). Possible adverse effects on blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes necessitate close monitoring of these variables. Beta-blockers should be considered in patients with symptomatic heart failure. If ACE-inhibitors are not tolerated, an angiotensin- II-blocker can be the added. Diuretics should only be used as adjunctive therapy to ACE-inhibitors. Aldosterone antagonists have a proven effect on survival, but close monitoring of potassium levels is imperative. Especially in the elderly, the renal function and level of electrolytes must be monitored closely. Device therapy, such ac cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, are only indicated for selected patients. ACE-inhibitors, diuretics and beta-blockers are the drugs-of-choice for patients with congestive heart failure with preserved systolic function. Health care for patients with congestive heart failure must be well organized on different levels of care and with multidisciplinary teams involved. The goal is to reduce morbidity and mortality in the heart failure population. This programme is meant for primary, secondary and third line health care providers in Norway.", 
    "69": "Skeletal muscle has the ability to achieve rapid repair in response to injury or disease. Many individuals with Marfan syndrome (MFS), caused by a deficiency of extracellular fibrillin-1, exhibit myopathy and often are unable to increase muscle mass despite physical exercise. Evidence suggests that selected manifestations of MFS reflect excessive signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (refs. 2,3). TGF-beta is a known inhibitor of terminal differentiation of cultured myoblasts; however, the functional contribution of TGF-beta signaling to disease pathogenesis in various inherited myopathic states in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that increased TGF-beta activity leads to failed muscle regeneration in fibrillin-1-deficient mice. Systemic antagonism of TGF-beta through administration of TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan normalizes muscle architecture, repair and function in vivo. Moreover, we show TGF-beta-induced failure of muscle regeneration and a similar therapeutic response in a dystrophin-deficient mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.", 
    "70": "The aims of the study were, in conscious Sprague-Dawley rats, to compare the effects of stresscopin-related peptide (SRP) and urocortin (UCN) 1 on blood pressure, heart rate, and regional hemodynamics; to determine whether or not there were residual tachycardic effects of SRP or UCN1 after cardiac autonomic blockade; and to investigate a possible involvement of corticotropin releasing factor type 1 (CRF1) receptor-mediated histamine release in the vasodilator actions of UCN1. SRP and UCN1 (both at 3 nmol/kg i.v.) caused hypotension, tachycardia, and mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilatation, but the magnitude and/or duration of the effects of UCN1 were generally greater than those of SRP. Pretreatment with atropine plus propranolol abolished the tachycardic effects of SRP and UCN1, and, under those conditions, the hypotensive effect of SRP, but not that of UCN1, was enhanced, probably because the hindquarters vasodilator effect of the latter was also reduced. Pretreatment with mepyramine plus cimetidine had no effect on the hemodynamic actions of either SRP or UCN1. It is concluded that, in conscious rats, the tachycardic effects of SRP and UCN1 are due to autonomic nervous activation mainly through baroreflex mechanisms. There is no evidence for an involvement of CRF1 receptor-mediated histamine release in the vasodilator actions of UCN1, but a propranolol-sensitive hindquarters vasodilator action of UCN, but not of SRP, was identified.",

It has been widely applied in treating ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, especially in emergency situations. In this study the effects of esmolol on sodium current (I(Na)) were investigated by the whole cell patch-clamp recording technique in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes. The results indicated that esmolol reversibly inhibited I(Na) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 74.2 +/- 0.60 micromol l(-1) with a Hill coefficient of 1.02 +/- 0.04. This inhibition was voltage- and frequency-dependent. Esmolol decreased the peak of the I-V relationship curve at -35 mV from 16.97 +/- 1.68 pA/pF to 6.96 +/- 0.51 pA/pF. The steady-state inactivation curve of I(Na) was shifted to more negative potentials, the voltage at half-inactivation changing from -78.75 +/- 2.3 mV in control to -85.94 +/- 3.2 mV in the presence of esmolol. The development of resting inactivation from closed states was accelerated by esmolol, the time constant was shortened from 62.75 +/- 3.21 ms to 24.93 +/- 2.43 ms, whereas the activation curve was not altered. I(Na) from inactivation could not be recovered completely in the presence of esmolol. These results suggest that esmolol inhibits I(Na) through sodium channel in rat ventricular myocytes by mechanisms involving preferential interaction with the inactivated state and acceleration of the development of inactivation directly from resting state. Therefore, the effect of inhibitory sodium of esmolol may play a vital role in its antiarrhythmic efficacy.", 
    "92": "Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent and morbid chronic disease that patients experience in stages. Progression through the stages of HF can be slowed with optimal medical therapy. Although HF remains a clinical diagnosis made at the bedside, measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can help in the diagnosis when there is uncertainty. The initial workup for patients with newly diagnosed HF is directed at identifying the underlying cause of left ventricular dysfunction. An assessment of hemodynamic status, determined by a careful physical examination, can be used to direct therapy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta blockers remain the two most important therapies for patients with chronic HF. Aldosterone antagonists improve mortality but require close monitoring for severe hyperkalemia. Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are excellent alternatives to ACEIs for ACEI-intolerant patients.

Trial data were reviewed and extracted independently by two investigators in an unblinded, standardized manner. Eight trials including a total of 1889 patients were analysed. There was heterogeneity in the type of antiarrhythmic used in the treatment arm (amiodarone, sotalol, azimilide, and dofetilide) as well as in the control group (five trials compared with placebo and three trials compared with beta-blocker). The main outcome, risk of shock therapy, was reduced when comparing amiodarone plus beta-blocker with beta-blocker alone (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14-0.52) and when comparing sotalol with placebo (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.4-0.78). The effect was not conclusive when comparing sotalol with other beta-blocker (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.37-1) and azimilide or dofetilide with placebo (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.58-1.04 and HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.43-1.04, respectively).

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, we evaluated the influence of losartan on surrogate markers of tubular injury, urine excretion of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) and amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) in 16 patients after transplantation. The patients received randomly either losartan (50-100 mg daily) or the beta-blocker carvedilol (12.5-25 mg) for 8 weeks, allowing a placebo washout between treatments. The target office through blood pressure (BP) was below 130/85 mmHg. The BP did not differ in the treatment periods. Losartan significantly decreased N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and alfa-1 microglobulin excretion relative to placebo and carvedilol. Urine excretion of TGF-beta1 and PIIINP was significantly lower after losartan. In conclusion, losartan reduces urine excretion of proteins associated with tubular damage and graft fibrosis.", 
    "110": "The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro vasomotor properties of rat extra-and intralobar pulmonary veins (PVs) related to their localization and to assess the modulatory role of endothelium on these properties. Segments from PVs were mounted in small vessel myograph and stretched at various diameters (D(10), D(20), D(30)) corresponding to intraluminal pressures of 10, 20 or 30 mmHg. At D(10) or D(20), contractile responses to phenylephrine, U46619 and angiotensin II of distal intralobar part of PVs were smaller compared with those of proximal extralobar part, but no longer different when distal part was stretched at D(30). When submitted to an NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, distal part of PV relaxed more strongly when stretched at D(30) compared with D(10). Acetylcholine and bradykinin were devoid of relaxing effect on distal parts stretched at D(10), but in contrast to acetylcholine, bradykinin slightly relaxed preparations stretched at D(30). Isoprenaline strongly relaxed PVs ( approximately 80% of initial precontraction), with the distal part exhibiting a higher sensitivity to the agonist compared with the proximal part. This relaxation was also observed with salbutamol and suppressed with ICI 118551, which is in favour of the involvement of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in this effect. Preincubation of the preparations with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) m) and indomethacin (10(-5) m) did not modify the contractile responses to U46619, nor the relaxing response to isoprenaline, which support that endothelium does not appear to play a significant modulatory role in these responses. Histological and electron microscopical examinations of proximal and distal sections of the same vein show that the layers of smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes were thicker in the proximal compared with the distal part. This study shows that, because of morphological heterogeneity of the PVs, the site of dissection and the initial condition of tension can play a significant role upon the sensitivity and the magnitude of the responses to both contractile and relaxing agonists.", 
    "111": "Wound healing is a complex and well-orchestrated biological process. Corneal epithelial cells (CECs) must respond quickly to trauma to rapidly restore barrier function and protect the eye from noxious agents. They express a high level of beta2-adrenergic receptors but their function is unknown. Here, we report the novel finding that they form part of a regulatory network in the corneal epithelium, capable of modulating corneal epithelial wound repair. Beta-adrenergic receptor agonists delay CEC migration via a protein phosphatase 2A-mediated mechanism and decrease both electric field-directed migration and corneal wound healing. Conversely, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists accelerate CEC migration, enhance electric field-mediated directional migration, and promote corneal wound repair. We demonstrate that CECs express key enzymes required for epinephrine (beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) synthesis in the cytoplasm and can detect epinephrine in cell extracts. We propose that the mechanism for the pro-motogenic effect of the beta-adrenergic antagonist is blockade of the beta2-adrenergic receptor preventing autocrine catecholamine binding. Further investigation of this network will improve our understanding of one of the most frequently prescribed class of drugs.", 
    "112": "Dendritic cells (DCs) in culture express at least connexin43, a protein subunit of gap junctions, and form gap junction channels, which could be important for T-cells activation. Here, we evaluated whether DCs express connexins in vivo and also to identify components of their microenvironment that regulate the functional expression of gap junctions. In vivo studies were performed in lymph nodes of mice under control conditions or after skeletal muscle damage. In double immunolabeling studies, connexin45 was frequently detected in DEC205(+) DCs in lymph nodes of control animals, whereas connexin43 was rarely found in DCs. However, connexin43 was upregulated in DCs after skeletal muscle damage. Upregulation of connexin43 gene expression by tissue damage was also confirmed in mice carrying a beta-galactosidase reporter gene in a connexin43 allele. The effect of several cytokines on the expression of functional gap junctions between cultured DCs was also tested. Under control conditions, cultured DCs did not communicate via gap junctions. However, after treatment with keratinocyte-conditioned medium or cytokine mixtures containing at least TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, they became transiently coupled through a pathway sensitive to octanol, a gap junction blocker. Cellular coupling induced by effective cytokine mixtures was prevented by IL-6. Single cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, or IL-6) or other mixtures than the described above did not induce coupling via gap junctions. Increased levels of connexin43 and connexin45 protein and mRNA accompanied the appearance of cellular coupling. These studies provide demonstration of connexin expression and regulation by specific danger signals in DCs.",

Single-dose pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were measured before and after 17 days of treatment with escitalopram 20 mg/d, duloxetine 60 mg/d, or sertraline 100 mg/d in young healthy male and female participants. The outcome measures were changes in metoprolol peak plasma levels, area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and clearance. The results were tested using paired t tests and independent t tests. The addition of each drug produced statistically significant changes in metoprolol pharmacokinetics. The rank order for the change in metoprolol area under the plasma concentration-time curve was duloxetine (180%) > escitalopram (89%) > sertraline (48% and 67%). Compared with sertraline, duloxetine produced statistically significantly larger changes in metoprolol pharmacokinetic parameters.

Prevention of a recurrent haemorrhage is therefore recommended. Patients who were not on a primary prophylaxis should be treated with non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, endoscopic band ligation or both. If beta-blockers are not tolerated or are contraindicated, patients should be treated with endoscopic band ligation. If these preventive strategies fail, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (covered) or a small-diameter surgical shunt is indicated.", 
    "124": "Variceal bleeding is a serious complication in patients with cirrhosis. Although bleeding related mortality rates have fallen recently, it continues to be amongst the leading causes of death. Cirrhotics should be screened for varices at diagnosis. Data on preventing formation/growth of oesophageal varices (pre-primary prophylaxis) are conflicting, with insufficient evidence to use beta-blockers. In order to prevent first bleeding, there is strong evidence in patients with medium/large size oesophageal varices that either non-selective beta-blockers or banding ligation can be used. Banding is superior with respect to bleeding but mortality is similar. Non-selective beta-blockers should remain first line treatment being effective, cheap and without serious complications. In contrast banding ligation is more expensive, requires specialised staff, cannot prevent bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy and can cause iatrogenic bleeding. Patients with small varices, particularly if they have progressive liver disease also benefit from beta-blockers, but fewer studies confirm this therapeutic approach.",

The diagnosis of CHF can remain unsuspected in patients with COPD, because shortness of breath is attributed to COPD. Measurement of plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels helps to uncover unsuspected CHF in patients with COPD and clinical deterioration. Noninvasive assessment of cardiac function may be preferable to BNP to uncover unsuspected left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with stable COPD. Patients with COPD or CHF develop skeletal muscle alterations that are strikingly similar. Functional intolerance correlates with severity of skeletal muscle alterations but not with severity of pulmonary or cardiac impairment in COPD and CHF, respectively. Improvement of pulmonary or cardiac function does not translate into relief of functional intolerance in patients with COPD or CHF unless skeletal muscle alterations concomitantly regress. The mechanisms responsible for skeletal muscle alterations are incompletely understood in COPD and in CHF. Disuse and low-level systemic inflammation leading to protein synthesis/degradation imbalance are likely to contribute. The presence of COPD impacts on the treatment of CHF, as COPD is still viewed as a contraindication to beta-blockade. Therefore, COPD often deprives patients with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction of the most beneficial pharmacologic intervention. A large body of data indicates that patients with COPD tolerate well selective beta-blockade that should not be denied to CHF patients with concomitant COPD.", 
    "140": "Tremor is one of the most frequent neurological signs. The correct clinical classification is mainly clinical. The most frequent primarily neurological tremor is essential tremor (prevalence 2 to 5%). It presents in most cases as a more or less symmetrical postural and kinetic tremor. In about 60% of cases an autosomal-dominant inheritance is found. Tremor may manifest not only in the hands but also in the head and voice. In about 60 to 70% of the patients alcohol may improve the tremor. Parkinsonian tremor is normally a tremor at rest and it starts asymmetrically. The legs and the face are frequently involved. Cerebellar tremor is intentional. Orthostatic tremor, which has a high frequency, mainly manifests in the legs and gives rise to postural instability. Dystonic tremor is an action tremor of the affected region of the body. Drug therapy, which is purely symptomatic, mostly depends on clinical manifestation. Postural and action tremors respond to non selective betablockers (propranolol), primidone, some antiepileptics (gabapentin, toparimate) and benzodiazepines. Classical rest tremors are improved by dopaminergic substances (levodopa, dopamine agonists) or anticholinergics. Dystonic tremor may successfully be treated by injections of botulinum toxin. Orthostatic tremor responds to gabapentin or benzodiazepines in some of the patients. In severely handicapped patients with refractory tremors the implantation of thalamic stimulation electrodes may be considered.

Metoprolol is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, and desethylamiodarone, a metabolite of amiodarone, has a markedly greater inhibitory effect on CYP2D6 than amiodarone. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone on the serum concentration/dose ratio (C/D) of metoprolol in 120 inpatients with cardiac arrhythmias that received either metoprolol and amiodarone (MET+AMD group, n=30) or metoprolol alone (MET group, n=90). The ratio of administered metoprolol was compared between the MET and the MET+AMD groups. The dose of metoprolol and patient age were significantly higher in the MET group when compared with the MET+AMD group (1.00+/-0.480 versus 0.767+/-0.418 mg/kg/day, p<0.050; 68.6+/-10.6 versus 57.6+/-14.1 years, p<0.001, respectively), but the C/D ratio was significantly lower in the MET group than in the MET+AMD group (90.8+/-64.0 versus 136+/-97.8, p<0.01). Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the C/D ratio and desethylamiodarone concentration (n=30, r=0.371, p<0.01). The results suggest that there is a significant interaction between amiodarone and metoprolol via desethylamiodarone-induced inhibition of CYP2D6.

In order to clarify this problem, the present study concentrated on the effects of catecholamines on blood pressure in the femoral bone marrow cavity in ovariectomized rats. The Ficat-Arlet method was used to examine blood pressure in marrow cavity.

A direct stimulator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin and adrenergic drugs, such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, strongly increased cAMP accumulation in IBMX-treated HMEC-1 cells, whereas some other drugs known to stimulate the nucleotide synthesis in different cell/tissues were inactive (dopamine, histamine). Adrenaline was significantly more potent than noradrenaline. The effect of adrenaline on cyclic AMP production was reproduced by a selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline, antagonized by beta-blocker propranolol, and was not influenced by both alpha(1) and alpha(2)-selective antagonists, prazosin and yohimbine, respectively. Adrenaline did not significantly affect the ability of HMEC-1 cells to produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or interleukin-8 (IL-8), the major angiogenic mediators.

AHI and CAI were negatively correlated with the dose of carvedilol (Spearman rho = - 0.61, p < 0.0001; and Spearman rho = - 0.57, p = 0.0002, respectively). Multiple regression analysis selected no use of beta-blockers as an independent factor of CAI (p = 0.0006).

    "153": "We report the development of a novel technology that enables the wireless transmission of sufficient amounts of power to implantable physiological devices. The system involves a primary unit generating the magnetic field and a secondary pickup unit deriving power from the magnetic field and a power conditioner. The inductively coupled system was able to supply a minimum of 20 mW at all locations and pickup orientations across a rat cage, although much higher power of up to 10 W could be achieved. We hypothesized that it would be possible to use this technology to record a high-fidelity ECG signal in a conscious rat. A device was constructed in which power was utilized to recharge a battery contained within a telemetry device recording ECG signal sampled at 2,000 Hz in conscious rats (200-350 g) living in their home cage. Attributes of the ECG signal (QT, QRS, and PR interval) could be obtained with a high degree of accuracy (<1 ms). ECG and heart rate changes in response to treatment with the beta blocker propranolol and the proarrhythmic alkaloid aconitine were measured. Transmitters were implanted for up to 4 mo, and the characteristic circadian variation in heart rate was recorded. Such technology allows potentially lifetime monitoring without the need for implant refurbishment. The ability to provide suitable power levels to implanted devices without concern to the orientation of the device and without causing heating provides the basis for the development of new devices to record or influence physiological signals in animals or humans over significantly longer time periods than can currently be accommodated.",

    "162": "Beta3-adrenergic agonists have been considered as potent antiobesity and antidiabetic agents mainly on the basis of their beneficial actions discovered twenty years ago in obese and diabetic rodents. The aim of this work was to verify whether prolonged treatment with a beta3-adrenergic agonist known to stimulate lipid mobilisation, could promote desensitization of beta-adrenergic responses. Wistar rats and guinea pigs were treated during one week with CL 316243 (CL, 1 mg/kg/d) by implanted osmotic minipumps. In control animals, beta3-adrenergic agonists were lipolytic in rat but not in guinea pig adipocytes. CL-treatment did not alter body weight gain in both species, but reduced fat stores in rats. Lipolysis stimulation by forskolin was unmodified but responses to beta1-, beta2- and beta3-agonists were reduced in visceral or subcutaneous white adipose tissues of CL-treated rats. Similarly, the beta3-adrenergic-dependent impairment of insulin action on glucose transport and lipogenesis in rat adipocytes was diminished after CL-treatment. In rat adipocytes, [125I]ICYP binding and beta3-adrenoceptor mRNA levels were reduced after sustained CL administration. These findings show that CL 316243 exerts (beta3-adrenergic lipolytic and antilipogenic effects in rat adipocytes. These actions, which are likely involved in the fat depletion observed in rat, also lead to the desensitization of all beta-adrenergic responses. Therefore this desensitization, together with the lack of slimming action in guinea pig, seriously attenuates the usefulness of beta3-agonists as antiobesity agents, and may explain why such agonists have not been conducted to a widespread clinical use.", 
    "163": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an important entity of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Everyday circumstances which significantly increase the risk of the onset of ACS during the period of several hours have been termed acute risk factors. This term includes morning hours and various possible external triggers such as heavy physical exertion, emotional stress, sexual activity, meteorological stress, and large meals. Possible external triggers precede approximately a half of the onsets of ACS, more frequently in men. Conversely, emotional stress plays a more important role in the triggering of ACS in women. Circadian rhythm represents an independent natural pattern of endogenous functions which is responsible for the morning excess in the incidence of ACS. A beneficial effect of regular physical activity and use of beta-blocker, calcium antagonists, nitrates and aspirin in the prevention of triggering ACS by acute risk factors has been described. Identification of further acute risk factors and better understanding of internal triggering mechanisms may improve the prevention of ACS and other cardiovascular incidents.", 
    "164": "Recent studies showed that chronic beta-adrenoceptor (AR) blocker treatment exerts beneficial effects in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). In CHF, sympathetic drive to the heart is increased, and this causes pathological changes in cardiac beta-AR-G-protein(s)-adenylyl cyclase system: Cardiac beta-1 AR are decreased, and amount and activity of cardiac G(i)-protein and G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) are increased resulting in diminished cardiac beta-AR functional responsiveness. One possible mechanism of beneficial effects of beta-AR blockers could be that they prevent adverse effects of increased sympathetic activity and up-regulate cardiac (and vascular) beta-AR density, and by this, enhance beta-AR-mediated effects. Another possibility could be that chronic beta-AR blocker treatment normalizes activity of G(i)-protein and may thereby restore beta-AR functional responsiveness. Moreover, failing human heart exhibits an inverse force-frequency relationship. beta-AR blockers reduce heart rate; this may, therefore, improve force of contraction. One of the strongest stimuli to activate GRK is increased sympathetic activity (as in CHF) via beta-AR stimulation. beta-AR blockers, by blocking beta-AR, can prevent GRK activation and/or can reduce the (previously enhanced) GRK activity, and this might-at least partly-contribute to beneficial effects of beta-AR blockers in CHF treatment. Finally, the \"loss-of-function\" Arg389Gly beta-1 AR polymorphism seems to determine heart rate and blood pressure responses to beta-1 AR blocker administration: Arg389Arg beta-1 AR subjects exhibit stronger effects than subjects with one or two Gly389 alleles. Thus, it might be predicted that patients homozygous Arg389 beta-1 AR should be good responders, whereas patients homozygous Gly389 beta-1 AR polymorphism should be poor or non-responders.",

In liver, kidney, and gills of trout and carp exposed to carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and metoprolol, ultrastructural effects were qualitatively described and semi-quantitatively assessed. The obtained assessment values were compared with previously published data for diclofenac-induced effects in rainbow trout tissues. Quantitative analyses of protein accumulated in kidneys of diclofenac-exposed trout corroborated previously published data which indicated that diclofenac induced a severe glomerulonephritis resulting in a hyaline droplet degeneration of proximal kidney tubules. The investigations provided information on the general health status of the pharmaceutical-exposed fish, and allowed a differential diagnosis of harmful effects caused by these human pharmaceuticals in non-target species.

A total of 168 patients (86 women and 82 men average age 62.9 +/- 12.9 years) from three dialysis centers were included in this study. Arterial hypertension was defined as blood pressure immediately before hemodialysis > 140/90 mmHg or less if the patient has been on anti-hypertensive therapy.

Oxydative processes and oxygen free radicals participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The concentration of oxygen free radicals is increased in patients with arterial hypertension. Antioxidant could neutralise oxygen free radicals. There are endogenous antioxidants like vitamin E, vitamin C etc. Some antihypertensive drugs have antioxidant properties and they could neutralise free oxygen radicals. These drugs are: calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blocker carvedilol and blocker of alpha-receptors-doxazosine.

Application of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers reduces the risk for the onset of diabetes mellitus by 20-27%, and calcium channel blockers by 16%. Despite some uncertainties, novel studies have demonstrated an increased risk for cardiovascular complications related to new onset diabetes mellitus. The duration of patient monitoring is also an important factor, as the onset of diabetes-related complications is closely associated with the duration of this disease. Considering all above, the aim of preventing the onset of diabetes is to recognize patients with an increased risk. The risk factors include basal glycemia, positive family history for diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and some ethnic groups (South Asia, the Caribbeans). Therefore, increased-risk patients should be subjected to therapy with ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or calcium channel blocker as the first drug of choice.

    "204": "Following a persistence of tachycardia for more than 1 min, landiolol was infused at 0.03125, 0.0625 and 0.125 mg kg(-1) min(-1) for 1 min followed by 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 mg kg(-1)min(-1) for 10 min in groups L, M and H, respectively. Heart rate (HR), systolic (sBP) and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were recorded each minute during the procedure. The respective changes were evaluated using logistic analysis with the equation Y(t) = p + (q - p)/[1 + exp {4m/(q - p))(k - t)}], where p, q, m and k indicate the upper asymptote, lower asymptote, maximum slope and time at the maximum slope.", 
    "205": "Parameters q and k for HR in group H were smaller than those in group L, whereas the parameters for sBP and dBP were unchanged among the three groups. Parameter q for HR in group H decreased with age of the patient. There was no significant difference in the landiolol-induced change in HR between males and females.", 
    "206": "The hemodynamic response to landiolol is reliably modeled by the logistic function, especially in terms of HR. Landiolol causes a rapid and dose-dependent decrease in HR, whereas landiolol-induced changes in sBP and dBP are independent of dose. The landiolol-induced decrease in HR becomes larger with aging, but shows no sex difference. The logistic model may be useful for studying hemodynamic responses to landiolol based on age and sex differences, and may allow development of an improved monitoring system.", 
    "207": "The logistic function reliably represents the hemodynamic responses to landiolol. Landiolol reduces HR rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner whereas landiolol-induced changes in sBP and dBP are independent of dose. A larger decrease in HR is caused by landiolol in elderly patients, but there is no sex difference in the landiolol-induced change in HR.", 
    "208": "Beta(3)-adrenoceptors mediate some of the effects of catecholamines on tissues such as blood vessels or the urinary bladder and are putative targets for the treatment of diseases such as the overactive bladder syndrome. Progress in the understanding of the presence, function, and regulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors has been hampered by a lack of highly specific tools. \"Classical\" beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonists such as BRL 37,344 [(R*, R*)-(+/-)-4[2-[(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl) amino] propyl] phenoxyacetic acid] and CGP 12,177 [(+/-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one] are only partial agonists in many settings, have limited selectivity over other beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, and may additionally act on receptors other than beta-adrenoceptors. More efficacious and more selective agonists have been reported and, in some cases, are in clinical development but are not widely available for experimental studies. The widely used antagonist SR 59,230 [3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1-[(1,S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapth-1-ylamino]-2S-2-propanoloxalate] is not selective for beta(3)-adrenoceptors, at least in humans, and may actually be a partial agonist. Radioligands, which are suitable either for the selective labeling of beta(3)-adrenoceptors or for the nonselective labeling of all beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, are also missing. beta(3)- and beta(1)/beta(2) double knockout mice have been reported, but their usefulness for extrapolations in humans is questionable based upon major differences between humans and rodents with regard to the ligand recognition and expression profiles of beta(3)-adrenoceptors. While the common availability of more selective agonists and antagonists at the beta(3)-adrenoceptor is urgently awaited, the limitations of the currently available tools need to be considered in studies of beta(3)-adrenoceptor for the time being.", 
    "209": "While investigating the effects of systemic urotensin II (U-II), a potent vasoactive peptide acting at the UT receptor, we observed ear pinna flushing after systemic administration to conscious rats. In the present study, U-II-induced ear flushing was quantified in terms of ear pinna temperature change and potential mechanisms were explored.", 
    "210": "U-II-induced ear flushing was quantified by measuring lateral ear pinna temperature changes and compared to that of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a known cutaneous vasodilator. Further, the effects of a variety of pharmacological agents on U-II-induced ear flushing were explored.", 
    "211": "Subcutaneous injection of U-II (9 microg kg(-1))produced localized ear pinna flushing with an onset of approximately 15 min, a duration of approximately 30 min and a maximal temperature change of 9 degrees C. In contrast, CGRP caused cutaneous flushing within multiple cutaneous beds including the ear pinna with a shorter onset and greater duration than U-II. A potent UT receptor antagonist, urantide, blocked U-II-induced ear flushing but did not affect CGRP-induced ear flushing. Pretreatment with indomethacin or L-Nomega-nitroarginine methylester (L-NAME) abolished U-II-induced ear flushing. Mecamylamine or propranolol did not affect this response to U-II. Direct intracerebroventricular injection studies suggested that the ear flushing response to U-II was not mediated directly by the CNS.", 
    "212": "Our results suggest that U-II-induced ear flushing and temperature increase is mediated by peripheral activation of the UT receptor and involves prostaglandin- and nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation of small capillary beds in the rat ear pinna.", 
    "213": "Taken in combination, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins (combination pharmacotherapy) greatly reduce cardiac events. These therapies are underused, even among patients with drug insurance. Out-of-pocket spending is a key barrier to adherence. We estimated the impact of providing combination pharmacotherapy without cost sharing (\"full coverage\") to insured patients after a myocardial infarction (MI). Under base-case assumptions, compared to standard coverage, three years of full coverage will reduce mortality and reinfarction rates and will save 5,974 per patient. Our analysis suggests that covering combination therapy for such patients will save both lives and money.", 
    "214": "Little data are available about the hospital management of patients with decompensated heart failure (HF) with individual and combination medical therapies, particularly from the more generalizable perspective of a population-based investigation. The purpose of our study was to describe the use of different cardiac medications in 2463 patients with new-onset HF who were discharged from all greater Worcester, Massachusetts, hospitals during 2000.", 
    "215": "On the basis of a review of medical records, we examined the prescribing of 2 classes of cardiac medications that have been shown to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with HF (angiotensin pathway inhibitors and beta-blockers). We also examined the use of 2 therapies commonly used to improve the symptomatic status of patients with acute HF (diuretics and digoxin).", 
    "216": "The mean age of the study sample was 76 years, and 57% were women. Approximately 1 in 5 patients were not prescribed beta-blockers or angiotensin inhibitors during their index hospitalization, whereas 1 in 3 patients were discharged with both of these effective cardiac medications. Diuretics were prescribed for virtually all patients (98%), followed by the use of digoxin in approximately half of patients (48%). The receipt of both beta-blockers and angiotensin pathway inhibitors was associated with several demographic, medical history, and clinical factors. Patients treated with both effective cardiac medications were also more likely to be counseled to monitor or modify several lifestyle factors that have been shown to be effective adjuncts to the medical management of patients with HF.", 
    "217": "Considerable opportunity remains for the more optimal hospital management of patients with decompensated HF.", 
    "218": "The ligand-binding characteristics (B(max) and K(D)) of alpha(1)- and beta(1)/beta(2)-adrenoceptors were investigated in membranes prepared from brown adipose tissue (BAT) of warm-acclimated, cold-acclimated, hibernating and arousing ground squirrels (Spermophillus undulatus) and hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) by specific binding of [(3)H]prazosin and [(3)H]CGP-12177, respectively. The physiological state did not change the affinity for the adrenoceptors in the BAT of ground squirrels and hamsters. There was a significant decrease in alpha(1)-receptor density in arousing ground squirrels and a significant decrease in beta(1)/beta(2) density in hibernating ground squirrels. The level of alpha(1)-receptors was in all conditions higher than that of beta(1)/beta(2) receptors. The results indicate a possible change in balance of adrenoceptor density in the processes of cold acclimation, hibernation and arousal. The balance between the various adrenoceptor subtypes may be important for the final effect of catecholamines in BAT in different physiological states.", 
    "219": "The interaction between the chiral drug of propranolol (PPL) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP, orosomucoid) has been first studied by fluorescence spectrophotometry. The fluorescence intensity of PPL increased due to the addition of AGP into PPL. The equation of Scatchard was employed to calculate the association constant and binding site number of the two enantiomers with AGP. The association constant is 2.62 x 10(5)M-1 for R-PPL and 8.57 x 10(5)M-1 for S-PPL and the binding site number is 0.41 for R-PPL and 1.17 for S-PPL at 17 degrees C respectively. The method of thermodynamics was applied to determine the binding type of S-PPL with AGP. The results suggested that the binding type is mainly van der waals force or hydrogen bond. At last the effect of three metal cations on the association constant and the binding site number of S-PPL with AGP was examined.", 
    "220": "In the present study, we examined the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of the mixture of alpha- and beta-amyrin (AMY), pentacyclic triterpenes isolated from the stem bark resin of Protium heptaphyllum. These effects of AMY were demonstrated by the open-field, elevated-plus-maze, rota rod, forced swimming, and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time tests, in mice. In the open-field test, AMY at the doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg, after intraperitoneal or oral administrations, significantly decreased the number of crossings, grooming, and rearing. All these effects were reversed by the pre-treatment with flumazenil (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), similarly to those observed with diazepam used as a positive standard. In the elevated-plus-maze test, AMY increased the time of permanence and the number of entrances in the open arms. On the contrary, the time of permanence and the number of entrances in the closed arms were decreased. All these effects were also completely reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors. In the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time test, AMY at the same doses significantly increased the animals sleeping time duration. In the rota rod test, AMY did not alter motor coordination and, thus, was devoid of effects, as related to controls. Since AMY, at the doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg, showed a sedative effect in the open field test, lower doses (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) were used in the forced swimming test, producing a decrease in the immobility time, similarly to that of imipramine, the positive control. The effect of AMI was greater when it was administered 15 min after imipramine (10 mg/kg). However, the antidepressant AMY effects were not altered by the previous administration of paroxetine, a selective blocker of serotonin uptake. In addition, AMY effects in the forced swimming test were totally blocked by reserpine pretreatment, a drug known to induce depletion of biogenic amines. In conclusion, the present work evidenced sedative and anxiolytic effects of AMY that might involve an action on benzodiazepine-type receptors, and also an antidepressant effect where noradrenergic mechanisms will probably play a role.", 
    "221": "Systemic lupus erythematosus can be idiopathic or drug-induced. Although a number of beta-blockers have been reported to induce a lupus-like syndrome, to the best of our knowledge, no such case has been described following celiprolol therapy. We diagnosed a lupus-like syndrome in a 67-year-old female patient who developed febrile polyarthritis, percarditis, antinuclear and anti-histone antibodies after taking celiprolol for 2 years. Despite drug withdrawal, prolonged corticotherapy was needed to obtain clinical and biological remission.", 
    "222": "Hepatic portoenterostomy or Kasai operation has been widely accepted as the standard therapy for biliary atresia. Recently, more female patients have grown up and reached adulthood; therefore, pregnancy in women with biliary atresia is sometimes inevitable. The authors report a 17-year-old woman with biliary atresia post Kasai operation at 3 months of age. After the operation, she became jaundice-free but developed portal hypertension with abnormal liver function. She had several episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding and was treated by beta-blocker and endoscopic sclerotherapy. Since then, she was lost to follow up for nearly 2 years. She came back again with 12 weeks of gestation with no symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding for antenatal care. At 32 weeks of gestation, she presented with severe hematemesis from variceal bleeding and had thrombocytopenia from hypersplenism. She was treated with somatostatin analogue, fluid and blood component replacement and other supportive treatments. Cesarean section was performed when she was stable at 33 weeks of gestation. After the operation, her clinical status was improved and had no other complications. Her baby experienced complications of prematurity but improved after treatment. Pregnancy may affect the natural course of portal hypertension and worsen the clinical outcome. Pregnancy should be avoided in patients with portal hypertension, however it is not contraindicated. Pregnancy in biliary atresia patients needs intensive prenatal care.", 
    "223": "Patients with atrial repair for transposition of the great arteries and patients with congenitally corrected transposition have a right ventricle (RV) in the systemic position and they may develop RV dysfunction and exercise intolerance with advancing age. No data is available on the effect of carvedilol in patients with dysfunctional systemic RV.", 
    "224": "We studied with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and standard 12-leads electrocardiogram, 8 adults (median age 26 years, range 18-31) with chronic stable heart failure and systemic RV dysfunction (6 patients with atrial repair and 2 patients with congenitally corrected transposition). Assessment was done before and after 12 months of carvedilol administration. The initial dose was 3.125 mg twice daily, and the target dose was 25 mg twice a day.", 
    "225": "Carvedilol administration was safe and the target dose was achieved in 5/8 (62%) patients. Right ventricular end-diastolic (119 \u00b1 31 vs. 112 \u00b1 28 ml/m\u00b2, p=0.01) and end-systolic volumes decreased (79 \u00b1 17 vs. 65 \u00b1 14 ml/m\u00b2, p=0.006), and RV ejection fraction improved (34 \u00b1 6 vs. 42 \u00b1 7%, p=0.004). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased (44 \u00b1 8 vs. 49 \u00b1 9%, p=0.01), suggesting a positive biventricular remodelling. Peak oxygen uptake did not change with carvedilol (26.8 \u00b1 5.3 vs. 27.3 \u00b1 5.7 ml O\u2082/Kg/min, p=0.58), whereas exercise duration increased (13.4 \u00b1 2.6 vs. 17.3 \u00b1 3.1 min, p=0.008).", 
    "226": "In this small cohort, carvedilol administration was safe and it was associated with positive RV remodelling as well as improved exercise duration."
