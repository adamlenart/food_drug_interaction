    "1": "A 68-year-old woman taking 5 mg of betaxolol for hypertension occasionally experienced asthmatic coughing after upper respiratory tract infection. Two years after the start of betaxolol, her asthma gradually worsened. Although pharmacotherapy for asthma was introduced, betaxolol was continued. Finally, she was admitted to hospital with bronchospasm. When she was discharged after 2 months, betaxolol was discontinued and losartan potassium (25 mg/d) was initiated instead for her hypertension. Since then, she has been free from bronchospasm.", 
    "2": "We calculated the mean receptor occupancy (phiSS) of the beta1- and beta2-receptors after the usual oral dose of betaxolol by using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters obtained from the literature. We estimated the decrease in the exercise pulse rate or the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by applying the phiSS values to the model previously reported by us.", 
    "3": "Betaxolol seems less likely than other beta1-blocking agents to cause pulmonary adverse effects. However, the estimated decrease in FEV1 after oral administration of betaxolol (5 mg) was close to that after oral bisoprolol (5 mg), which has been reported to induce asthma.", 
    "4": "Oral betaxolol may induce bronchospasm, although betaxolol is considered to be highly cardioselective and seems less likely than other beta1-selective blocking agents to cause pulmonary adverse effects. Betaxolol should be administered with caution to patients with asthma or chronic pulmonary disease.", 
    "5": "Type 2 diabetes has reached epidemic proportions and an increasing proportion of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are diabetics. CAD in diabetics has specificities and, in particular, more extensive atherosclerosis; diabetic patients are also more frequently asymptomatic, with silent myocardial ischemia, which makes the diagnosis of CAD more difficult. In addition, diabetic patients with CAD have poorer outcomes than nondiabetics. The management of diabetic patients with CAD is based on intensive intervention on lifestyle and risk factors, together with the mandatory use of medications of proven benefit as regards secondary prevention in coronary patients: antiplatelet agents, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Glycemic control is also essential; although the use of sulfonylureas has been controversial, there is now a vast amount of data suggesting a beneficial effect, in particular when agents more specific for the pancreatic adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium (K(ATP)) channels are used. At the acute stage of myocardial infarction, the Diabetes mellitus, Insulin Glucose infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) trial suggested a beneficial effect of insulin therapy prolonged for 3 months after hospital discharge; these data will have to be confirmed by larger intervention trials. Finally, the respective roles of coronary angioplasty and coronary surgery in diabetics are debated; a post hoc analysis of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI) trial data showed increased mortality in diabetics with multivessel CAD treated with angioplasty compared with surgery, but the results of the more recent trials using intracoronary stents appear more balanced; in this regard, the effects of drug-eluting stents, which dramatically decrease the incidence of re-stenosis, seem promising.", 
    "6": "Infections are a leading cause of death in stroke patients. In a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia, we tested the hypothesis that a stroke-induced immunodeficiency increases the susceptibility to bacterial infections. 3 d after ischemia, all animals developed spontaneous septicemia and pneumonia. Stroke induced an extensive apoptotic loss of lymphocytes and a shift from T helper cell (Th)1 to Th2 cytokine production. Adoptive transfer of T and natural killer cells from wild-type mice, but not from interferon (IFN)-gamma-deficient mice, or administration of IFN-gamma at day 1 after stroke greatly decreased the bacterial burden. Importantly, the defective IFN-gamma response and the occurrence of bacterial infections were prevented by blocking the sympathetic nervous system but not the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Furthermore, administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol drastically reduced mortality after stroke. These data suggest that a catecholamine-mediated defect in early lymphocyte activation is the key factor in the impaired antibacterial immune response after stroke.", 
    "7": "Clinical studies have detected an unexpected inhibition of diabetic retinopathy by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, but the mechanism for this action is unclear. In light of evidence indicating that the severity of hyperglycemia is a major initiating factor in the pathogenesis of the retinopathy, this study was conducted to examine the effect of ACE inhibitors on glucose accumulation in retinas of diabetic rats.", 
    "8": "Rats were made experimentally diabetic by injection of streptozotocin and treated with captopril (25 mg/kg body weight per day) or atenolol (10 mg/kg body weight per day) for 8 weeks. Bovine retinal endothelial cells were cultured in medium containing either 5.5 or 25 mM glucose and treated with different concentrations of captopril or lisinopril for 5 days. Glucose content in retinas and cultured cells was measured by spectrometry. Expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 in retinas and cultured cells was determined by Western blot analysis. Glucose uptake was performed by using 3-O-methyl-D-[(3)H] glucose.", 
    "9": "Treatment of rats with captopril inhibited the diabetes-induced accumulation of glucose in the retina by 48% (P < 0.01) compared with the diabetic control, but atenolol had no significant effect. Similarly, captopril and lisinopril significantly inhibited intracellular accumulation of glucose in primary bovine retinal endothelial cells cultured in an elevated glucose concentration. These data indicate that the captopril-induced inhibition of glucose accumulation observed in retinal tissue of diabetic rats was not due to reduction in blood pressure or in vascular permeability. Although it had no effect on the expression of the GLUT1 in retinas and cultured retinal endothelial cells, captopril at a concentration of 2 mM significantly inhibited the high-glucose-induced increase in GLUT1-mediated glucose transport in cultured retinal endothelial cells by 67% +/- 10%.", 
    "10": "Inhibition of glucose accumulation within retinal cells probably contributes at least in part to the observed inhibition of diabetic retinopathy by ACE inhibitors.", 
    "11": "To assess the relationship between potential risk factors and the development of open-angle glaucoma (OAG) in Australian residents aged 40 and or more years.", 
    "12": "A total of 3271 participants were recruited at baseline from nine urban areas through cluster random sampling and subjected to comprehensive standardized interviews and ophthalmic examination, both at baseline and at 5-year follow-up. The participation rate at follow-up was 85% of the surviving baseline cohort. OAG was diagnosed with definite, probable, or possible certainty by a consensus panel of six ophthalmologists. Potential risk factors identified at baseline included various sociodemographic, anthropometric, dietary, familial, medical, and ocular characteristics of the participants. Risk factor analyses were performed for development of at least possible OAG (possible, probable, and definite OAG) and then at least probable OAG (probable and definite OAG) to represent a higher level of certainty. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.", 
    "13": "Increased age and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) were associated with increased risk of development of OAG, according to multivariate analyses. A family history of glaucoma (relative risk [RR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03-4.2), the presence of age-related macular degeneration (RR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-3.9), the presence of pseudoexfoliation (RR = 9.4, 95% CI = 2.6-34.4), and a cup-disc ratio (CDR) greater than 0.7 (RR = 7.9, 95% CI = 4.4-14.1) were associated with greater risk of development of at least possible OAG. Having ever taken alpha-blockers (RR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.2-18.8), the presence of pseudoexfoliation (RR = 11.2, 95% CI = 2.0-63.3), and a CDR higher than 0.7 (RR = 11.0, 95% CI = 4.6-26.8) also indicated significant risk of development of at least probable OAG.", 
    "14": "Certain nonmodifiable risk factors may be used to identify high-risk individuals, and increased IOP remains an important modifiable risk factor for OAG. However, more prospective studies on risk factors are required to clarify further the etiological picture of OAG.", 
    "15": "Aldosterone has been implicated in the progression of heart failure. The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial (Val-HeFT) provided the first opportunity to examine the long-term effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker on plasma aldosterone levels in patients with NYHA class II through IV heart failure.", 
    "16": "Plasma aldosterone was measured by radioimmunoassay in core laboratories at baseline and during follow-up in patients assigned to valsartan at a target dose of 160 mg twice daily or placebo. In the placebo group, aldosterone (baseline, 150+/-160 pg/mL, mean+/-SD; n=2025) increased at 4, 12, and 24 months. In the valsartan group, aldosterone (baseline, 137+/-124 pg/mL, mean+/-SD; n=2023) decreased at 4 months and remained suppressed for up to 2 years. At end point (last measurement in each patient), mean aldosterone increased by 17.8+/-3.0 pg/mL (SEM) (11.9%) in the placebo group and decreased by 23.8+/-3.0 pg/mL (SEM) (-17.4%) in the valsartan group (P<0.00001). The effect of valsartan was similar in all subgroups, including those receiving neither ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) nor beta-blockers (BB) at baseline and those receiving concomitant ACE-I or BB. In contrast, outcome effects varied in the 4 subgroups, with a statistically significant reduction in the combined mortality/morbidity end point in those receiving neither neurohormonal inhibitor and an adverse trend in those treated with both drugs.", 
    "17": "Valsartan added to background therapy for heart failure produces sustained reduction in plasma aldosterone, consistent with the observed significant reduction in the combined mortality/morbidity end point. A similar reduction in all subgroups based on ACE-I or BB therapy, despite differing clinical outcomes in these subgroups, suggests that aldosterone plasma levels may not be a critical marker of the progression of heart failure.", 
    "18": "To describe the efficacy and tolerability of the different medications used to treat migraine in children and adolescents.", 
    "19": "A literature review of the drug studies involving children and adolescents for the treatment of migraine was conducted. The treatment of migraine is divided into abortive and prophylactic. The different classes of drugs are described in respect to its efficacy and side effects. Few placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are available in children as compared to adults for the treatment of migraine headaches. Only ibuprofen and nasal sumatriptan have been studied and shown to be effective in more than one double blind placebo-controlled study for the abortive treatment of migraine in children. Unlike the adult studies, the oral triptans tested in children have not been effective when compared to placebo. Only flunarizine has shown efficacy in more than one placebo controlled trial for the prophylactic treatment.", 
    "20": "Most of the medications used to treat migraine in children and adolescents are well tolerated. The treatment response of migraine in children and adolescents may differ from that of adults. There seems to be a high placebo response rate in the pediatric population. Therefore, further prospective placebo-controlled studies are needed.", 
    "21": "Preconditioning (PC) exhibits earlier and delayed protection. But the mechanism of cellular signaling in delayed protection of PC remains unclear. We explored the roles of ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK(alpha/beta) (p38(alpha/beta)) in delayed protection of anoxia preconditioning (APC). The anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R) injury and APC models were established in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. An ERK(1/2) inhibitor (PD98059) and a p38(alpha/beta) blocker (SB203580) were applied and their effects on A/R and APC models were observed. The cellular contents of MDA, SOD, cell viability and LDH release was measured at the end of the study. ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK total activity was measured by in-gel myelin basic protein phosphorylation assay at different points during sustained anoxia. The results obtained are as follows: (1) PD98059 (but not SB203580), administered in preconditioning anoxia phase in APC group, abolished completely the delayed protection of APC; (2) SB203580 administered in sustained anoxia phase in A/R group could relieve cell injury induced by anoxia, but not by PD98059; (3) the highest activity of ERK(1/2) and p38 MAPK induced by anoxia appeared at 4 h after the beginning of sustained anoxia. APC inhibited the over activation of both ERK(1/2) and p38 during the following sustained anoxia. These results suggest that ERK(1/2) activation during preconditioning may be an important link of cell signal transduction in the mechanism of APC delayed protection. p38(alpha/beta) activation at the preconditioning stage dose not participate in signaling of APC delayed protection. The excessive activation of p38(alpha/beta) is possibly a key factor in mediating cell injury induced by sustained anoxia. The inhibition of p38(alpha/beta) excessive activation during subsequent sustained anoxia might play a role in delayed protection mechanism of APC.", 
    "22": "As results of cardiac biopsies suggest, myocardial beta(1) -adrenoceptor density is reduced in patients with chronic heart failure. However, changes in cardiac beta(2)-adrenoceptors vary. With suitable radiopharmaceuticals single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) offer the opportunity to assess beta-adrenoceptors non-invasively. Among the novel racemic analogues of the established beta(1)-selective adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 89.406 the iodinated 2-I-ICI-H showed high affinity and selectivity to beta(1)-adrenoceptors in murine ventricular membranes. The aim of this study was its evaluation as a putative sub-type selective beta(1)-adrenergic radioligand in cardiac imaging.", 
    "23": "Competition studies in vitro and in vivo were used to investigate the kinetics of 2-I-ICI-H binding to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in mice and rats. In addition, the radiosynthesis of 2-(125)I-ICI-H from the silylated precursor 2-SiMe(3)-ICI-H was established. The specific activity was 80 GBq/ micro mol, the radiochemical yield ranged from 70 to 80%.", 
    "24": "The unlabelled compound 2-I-ICI-H showed high beta(1)-selectivity and -affinity in the in vitro competition studies. In vivo biodistribution studies apparently showed low affinity to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. The radiolabelled counterpart 2-(125)I-ICI-H showed a high degree of non-specific binding in vitro and no specific binding to cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptors in vivo.", 
    "25": "Because of its high non-specific binding 2-(125)I-ICI-H is no suitable radiotracer for imaging in vivo.", 
    "26": "The medical management of heart failure has undergone remarkable progress in the past 10 years. The paradigm shift is toward long-term reparative strategies that help in altering the biologic properties of the failing heart. Together with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers have emerged as standard therapy for heart failure, especially for patients with mild to moderate heart failure. Since most of the clinical trials demonstrating the benefits of betablockers have been done in patients with mild to moderate heart failure, some controversy exists about the utility of beta-blocking agents in patients with advanced heart failure. This review will summarize the rationale and the use of beta blockers, a very challenging therapeutic strategy, in patients with severe heart failure.", 
    "27": "An open, comparative, cross-over 8-week trial of beta-blockers nebivolol and metoprolol in 30 patients with arterial hypertension (AH) studied the office, ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate levels, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, endothelial NOS and NO production. It was found that nebivolol activated the system eNOS-NO and improved vasomotor parameters of the endothelium. Metoprolol failed to activate enzyme eNOS activity and NO production to the same level and did not improve the endothelial vasomotor function. The antihypertensive activity of nebivolol was higher than that of metoprolol. Thus, nebivolol can be used in patients with AH and cardiovascular risk factors to correct endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "28": "We studied effects of beta-adrenoblocker carvedilol vs placebo in 60 patients with chronic cardiac failure (CCF) of functional classes III-IV in a 6-month open randomized trial. We examined clinical course, exercise tolerance (a 6 min walk test), endothelial state markers (endothelium-dependent vasodilation, number of circulating endotheliocytes) and activity of systems affecting endothelium (triglycerides, malonic dialdehyde, IL-8, uric acid). The drug was added to conventional therapy (ACE inhibitors, diuretics, cardiac glycosides) in a stable CCF course. Carvedilol group of patients demonstrated a marked trend to reduction of the number of hospitalizations, attenuation of CCF, better tolerance to exercise, lower levels of uric acid (p < 0.05), malonic dialdehyde (p < 0.05) and IL-8 (p = 0.09). There was also wider basal diameter of the brachial artery, and in the diameter at the peak of reactive hyperemia (p = 0.07). The effect was dose-dependent: in patients given 25-50 mg/day of carvedilol there was a trend to a lower circulation of endotheliocytes, triglyceridemia, lipid peroxidation and chronic inflammation. Thus, long-term treatment of CCF with inclusion of standard doses of carvedilol not only improves clinical status of the patients but produces a noticeable endothelioprotective effect.", 
    "29": "Centrally acting (moxonidine) and peripherally acting (metoprolol) sympatholytic agents might have different actions upon penile circulation in hypertensive men with erectile dysfunction. A total of 11 nonsmoking, hypertensive but otherwise healthy men with erectile dysfunction were studied after 8 weeks on moxonidine monotherapy (0.4 mg per day, increased to 0.6 mg if needed) and then after 8 weeks of metoprolol monotherapy (100 mg per day, increased to 200 mg if needed) in a crossover design. At the end of each treatment phase, the subjects were asked about their subjective erectile capacity (nocturnal and coital erections), and resting and stimulated (after intracavernosal injection of a mixture of alprostadil and phentolamine) penile deep artery diameters and systolic peak velocities were measured by color Doppler ultrasonography. There were no significant differences in blood pressure after either therapy. The change from earlier antihypertensive therapy, moxonidine produced significant subjective amelioration of sexual dysfunction in 9/11 of the men (< or = 0.001), whereas 9/11 returned to impaired dysfunction after crossover to metoprolol treatment. Resting and stimulated deep penile diameters and peak systolic velocities were higher after moxonidine treatment compared with metoprolol (diameters: < or = 0.004, < or = 0.0001; velocities: < or = 0.008, < or = 0.038). The centrally acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine seems to improve erectile function both subjectively and objectively and has a better effect on penile circulation compared with the peripherally acting sympatholytic agent metoprolol.", 
    "30": "A number of drugs have been tested in clinical trials to decrease cardiac complications in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. To compare the results of these studies, we conducted a quantitative systematic review. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized trials that assessed myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, 30-day cardiac mortality, and adverse effects. Data were combined using a fixed-effect model and expressed as Peto odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and as numbers-needed-to-treat/harm (NNT/H). Twenty-one trials involving 3646 patients were included: 11 trials using beta-blockers (6 drugs; 866 patients), 6 clonidine or mivazerol (614 patients), 3 diltiazem or verapamil (121 patients), and 1 nitroglycerin (45 patients). All trials had an inactive control; there were no direct comparisons. beta-blockers decreased ischemic episodes during surgery (7.6% versus 20.2% with placebo; OR 0.32 [95% CI, 0.17-0.58]; NNT 8) and after surgery (15.2% versus 27.9% with control; OR 0.46 [95% CI, 0.26-0.81]; NNT 8). alpha(2)-agonists decreased ischemia during surgery only (19.4% versus 32.8%; OR 0.47 [95% CI, 0.33-0.68]; NNT 7). beta-blockers reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (0.9% versus 5.2%; OR 0.19 [95% CI, 0.08-0.48]; NNT 23) but only when 2 trials with high-risk patients were included. The effect of alpha(2)-agonists on myocardial infarction was not significant (6.1% versus 7.3%; OR 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62-1.14]). beta-blockers significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 3.9% to 0.8% (OR 0.25 [95% CI, 0.09-0.73], NNT 32). alpha(2)-agonists significantly decreased the risk of cardiac death from 2.3% to 1.1% (OR 0.50 [95% CI, 0.28-0.91], NNT 83). For calcium channel blockers and nitroglycerin, evidence of any benefit was lacking. The most common adverse effect was bradycardia, which occurred in 24.5% of patients receiving a beta adrenergic blocker versus 9.1% of controls (OR 3.76 [95% CI, 2.45-5.77], NNH 6).", 
    "31": "The present study assessed the possible involvement of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in thyroxine (T4)-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Hemodynamic parameters, heart weight (HW), ratio of HW to body weight (HW/BW), and myocyte width were evaluated in absence of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) and after T4 administration. Male Wistar rats were used. Some were subjected to thyroidectomies, whereas hyperthyroidism was induced in others via daily intraperitoneal injection of T4 (25 or 100 microg x 100 g BW(-1) x day(-1)) for 7 days. In some cases, T4 administration was combined with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (Ena), with the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker losartan (Los) or with the beta-adrenergic blocker propanolol (Prop). Hemodynamics and morphology were then evaluated. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was not altered by administration of either T4 alone or T4 in combination with the specific inhibitors. However, SBP decreased significantly in hypothyroid rats. An increased heart rate was seen after administration of either T4 alone or T4 in combination with either Los or Ena. Although the higher dose of T4 significantly increased HW, HW/BW increased in both T4-treated groups. Ena and Prop inhibited the increase in HW or HW/BW in hyperthyroid rats. Morphologically, both T4 dose levels significantly increased myocyte width, an occurrence prevented by RAS or SNS blockers. There was a good correlation between changes in HW/BW and myocyte width. These results indicate that T4-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with both the SNS and the RAS.",

Fourteen were treated with sotalol; 13 converted to sinus rhythm, of whom 2 relapsed. There was one intrauterine death. Four patients were treated with sotalol and digoxin, of whom two were treated successfully. Mean birth weight was 3,266 g. The daily maternal sotalol dose was linearly related to the maternal plasma concentration. The mean fetal/maternal sotalol plasma concentration was 1.1 (range 0.67 to 2.87, SD 0.63), and the mean amniotic fluid/fetal blood ratio of sotalol was 3.2 (range 1.28 to 5.8, SD 1.4). The effectiveness of sotalol therapy could not be extrapolated from maternal blood levels.",

Therefore it seems that renal excretion in the fetus is efficient and greater than the oral absorption by fetal swallowing. The maternal blood level is not a reliable predictor of the chances of success of therapy. Sotalol is not associated with fetal growth restriction.",

Sudden cardiac death was weakly predicted only by reduced EF (<0.40; p < 0.05), nsVT (p < 0.05), and abnormal SAECG (p < 0.05), but not by autonomic markers or standard ECG variables. The positive predictive accuracy of EF, nsVT, and abnormal SAECG as predictors of SCD was relatively low (8%, 12%, and 13%, respectively).",

    "42": "Recent studies suggest that aldosterone may play a larger role than once appreciated in normal physiologic function and cardiovascular disease. Some of the adverse cardiovascular effects that have been described include cardiac and vascular fibrosis, vascular necrosis and inflammation, impaired endothelial function, reduced fibrinolysis, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. In light of these findings, the ability to block the actions of aldosterone has gained increased therapeutic importance. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor blocker that displays little interaction with androgen and progesterone receptors. Eplerenone has already been approved for the treatment of systemic hypertension and has been evaluated in numerous hypertension subgroups, including patients with low plasma renin activity; diabetes; LVH; uncontrolled blood pressure while receiving monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, or beta-blockers; and in black patients. Results of these trials indicate that eplerenone lowers blood pressure and reduces end-organ damage. Further proof of the therapeutic importance of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade comes from the eplerenone post acute myocardial infarction survival and efficacy study (EPHESUS). In this large-scale clinical outcome trial, eplerenone was shown to reduce total mortality by 15% as well as the combined endpoint of cardiovascular mortality/cardiovascular hospitalization by 13% when administered at a mean of 7.3 days post myocardial infarction to patients with evidence of systolic left ventricular dysfunction and symptoms of heart failure. Eplerenone is well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile comparable to placebo. The advent of selective aldosterone blockers, such as eplerenone, should prove to be of great therapeutic value in hypertension control and prevention of cardiovascular disease and associated end-organ damage.", 
    "43": "Pi4 is a short toxin found at very low abundance in the venom of Pandinus imperator scorpions. It is a potent blocker of K(+) channels. Like the other members of the alpha-KTX6 subfamily to which it belongs, it is cross-linked by four disulfide bonds. The synthetic analog (sPi4) and the natural toxin (nPi4) have been obtained by solid-phase synthesis or from scorpion venom, respectively. Analysis of two-dimensional (1)H NMR spectra of nPi4 and sPi4 indicates that both peptides have the same structure. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings of the blocking of Shaker B K(+) channels by sPi4 (K(D) = 8.5 nM) indicate that sPi4 has the same blocking activity of nPi4 (K(D) = 8.0 nM), previously described. The disulfide bonds have been independently determined by NMR and structure calculations, and by Edman-degradation/mass-spectrometry identification of peptides obtained by proteolysis of nPi4. Both approaches indicate that the pairing of the half-cystines is (6)C-(27)C, (12)C-(32)C, (16)C-(34)C, and (22)C-(37)C. The structure of the toxin has been determined by using 705 constraints derived from NMR data on sPi4. The structure, which is well defined, shows the characteristic alpha/beta scaffold of scorpion toxins. It is compared to the structure of the other alpha-KTX6 subfamily members and, in particular, to the structure of maurotoxin, which shows a different pattern of disulfide bridges despite its high degree of sequence identity (76%) with Pi4. The structure of Pi4 and the high amounts of synthetic peptide available, will enable the detailed analysis of the interaction of Pi4 with K(+) channels.", 
    "44": "Early reinitiation of atrial fibrillation (ERAF) was commonly observed after successful electrical cardioversion, however, the effect of ERAF on the subsequent time course of arrhythmia recurrence remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical predictors and time course of AF recurrence with respect to the occurrence of ERAF after successful cardioversion. The clinical predictors and time course of AF recurrence were prospectively evaluated in 124 patients (94 men, 30 women; mean age 65 +/- 9 years) with persistent AF (mean AF duration 36 +/- 40 months), who underwent internal cardioversion. After cardioversion, all patients received treatment with sotalol and were monitored for AF recurrence. Successful restoration of sinus rhythm was achieved in 104 (84%) of 124 patients. ERAF was observed in 28 (27%) of 104 patients in whom 26 of them were successfully treated acutely with intravenous sotalol and repeated cardioversion. After a mean follow-up of 26 months, 29 (28%) of 104 patients remained in sinus rhythm. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly poorer outcome with regard to the recurrence of AF in patients with ERAF (hazard ratio 1.7,P = 0.03) and in those with AF for more than 3 years (hazard ratio 1.6,P = 0.03). Despite treatment with sotalol, patients with ERAF had a significantly higher AF recurrence rate within the first day (13/26 [50%] vs 12/76 [16%],P < 0.01), but not during long-term follow-up (21/26 [81%] vs 52/76 [68%],P = 0.3). In contrast, patients with AF for more than 3 years had a similar AF recurrence rate within the first day (7/29 [24%] vs 18/73 [25%],P = 1.0), but a significantly higher recurrence rate during long-term follow-up (27/29 [93%] vs 46/73 [37%],P < 0.01). In conclusion, the occurrence of ERAF and long AF duration were independent predictors for AF recurrence after successful internal cardioversion. The difference in the time course of AF recurrence in patients with ERAF from those with long AF duration suggests distinct arrhythmogenic mechanisms.", 
    "45": "Calcium signaling provides a central control mechanism for growth, differentiation and apoptosis of epidermal keratinocytes. Moreover, calcium signaling is important for carcinogenesis in view of the observations suggesting that emptying of intracellular stores in keratinocytes [e.g. by a selective blocker of calcium pump in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thapsigargin] facilitates skin cancer development. In this work, we analyzed whether calcium content in the intracellular stores is linked to HaCaT keratinocyte growth and apoptosis control. Treatment with thapsigargin caused calcium release from the intracellular pool and permanent pool depletion (up to 24 h) could be achieved using a high dose (1 micro M) of this inhibitor. HaCaT cells cultured in these conditions exhibited an increased rate of DNA synthesis, assessed by the BrdU incorporation assay. Moreover, a weak stimulation of involucrin (terminal differentiation marker) was observed. Studies where intracellular free calcium (Cai2+) was chelated with BAPTA [1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid] revealed that abrogation of thapsigargin-induced Cai2+elevation did not counteract its effects on DNA synthesis, but blocked thapsigargin-induced involucrin expression. Apoptosis was readily achieved by extracellular calcium chelation using EGTA [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid], but was not observed after thapsigargin or BAPTA alone or in combination. In conclusion, depletion of intracellular calcium stores causes stimulation of keratinocyte proliferation independently of the elevation of Cai2+.", 
    "46": "Several classes of drugs are used to treat hypertension but how they affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients is still under investigation. Recent outcome trials have examined the benefits associated with different levels of blood pressure control or have compared several of the 'newer' classes of antihypertensive drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, with 'older' drug classes, such as diuretics and beta-blockers. Other trials have compared antihypertensive drugs with placebo. We performed a meta-regression analysis of 30 clinical trials that included a total of 149,407 patients. We based our analysis on summary statistics reported in the literature, and showed that blood pressure gradients accounted for most, if not all, of the differences in outcome in patients with hypertension or at high cardiovascular risk. We also conducted a study in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension and showed that antihypertensive drug treatment starting with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, nitrendipine, reduced the risk of stroke and all cardiovascular complications. In addition, nitrendipine-based blood pressure-lowering therapy decreased the incidence of dementia. In diabetic patients, nitrendipine reduced the risk of proteinuria, decreased total mortality, and markedly improved cardiovascular prognosis. Taken together, these findings emphasize the desirability of tight blood pressure control.",

The median follow-up was 31.9 months (4.8 - 74.7) for group A and 23.2 months (3.0 - 70.0) for group B. Initial hemostasis was achieved in 40/41 patients (97 %). No significant difference was observed between groups A and B with regard to the incidence of early rebleeding (during the first 6 weeks; 5/21 and 3/20), bleeding-related deaths by 6 weeks (3/21 and 6/20), long-term rebleeding (11/21 and 5/20), or overall number of deaths (9/21 and 9/20).

Concomitant procedures included left atrial appendage closure in 493 (61%) patients, tricuspid annuloplasty-replacement in 348 (43%) patients, maze procedure in 185 (23%) patients, plication of the left atrium in 148 (18%) patients, and other procedures in 151 (19%) patients. Five-year actuarial survival was 91.1% +/- 2.3%. Freedom from stroke at 8 years was significantly better in patients with sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation (P <.001). Ninety-nine percent of patients with mitral valve replacement combined with a maze procedure were free from stroke, whereas only 89% of patients with mitral valve replacement alone were free from stroke at 8 years after surgical intervention. Seventy-two patients had late stroke; sixty-five patients (90%) were in atrial fibrillation, and 47 (65%) patients had the left atrial appendage closed. Multivariate analysis showed that late atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 3.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-6.67; P =.0001) and omission of the maze procedure (odds ratio, 3.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-10.14; P =.003) were the significant risk factors for late stroke.",

Restoration of sinus rhythm with a maze procedure nearly eliminated the risk of late stroke, whereas neither closure of the left atrial appendage nor therapeutic anticoagulation prevented this complication.", 
    "55": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses of neurons from within the inner rabbit retina were mapped using a channel permeable cation, 1-amino-4-guanidobutane (agmatine, AGB). Serial sections were subsequently probed with immunoglobulins targeting AGB, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine to visualize the NMDA responses of neurochemical subpopulations of neurons. Most inner retinal subpopulations of neurons demonstrated an NMDA concentration-dependent increase in activation. This NMDA-induced activation displayed a distinct pattern, with the most sensitive class to least sensitive class ranking being GC > GABA cAC > GABA/Gly cAC > Gly cAC > GABA dAC (GC, ganglion cells; AC, amacrine cells; c, conventional; d, displaced; Gly, glycine). The variable NMDA response may reflect differences in NMDA receptor subunit disposition or differences in receptor density. In addition to the variable NMDA activation pattern, we found that virtually all ganglion cells (87%) showed NMDA-gated AGB entry, compared with only 58% of amacrine cells. We conclude that a large cohort of amacrine cells do not possess functional NMDA receptors. In addition to most ganglion cells being activated by NMDA, a large subpopulation displayed the highest sensitivity to NMDA application. The functional significance of this finding is that the ganglion cell population will be the first neuronal class to be susceptible to glutamate-induced neurotoxicity mediated through the NMDA receptor. The addition of betaxolol significantly reduced NMDA-mediated AGB entry into most neuronal groups (ganglion cells, GABA, and glycine amacrine cells), with the greatest effect being on ganglion cells. Betaxolol had no significant effect on NMDA-gated entry of AGB on the GABA/Gly amacrine cell population.", 
    "56": "Anaphylaxis is a severe systemic allergic reaction that is potentially fatal. It requires prompt recognition and immediate management. Anaphylaxis has a rapid onset with multiple organ-system involvement and is mostly caused by specific antigens in sensitized individuals. Reactions typically follow a uniphasic course, however, 20% will be biphasic in nature. The second phase usually occurs after an asymptomatic period of 1-8 hours, but there may be a 24-hour delay. Protracted anaphylaxis may persist beyond 24 hours. Concurrent beta-blocker therapy may adversely affect the response to management. Epinephrine is the treatment of choice and should be administered immediately. Secondary measures include circulatory support, H(1) and H(2) antagonists, corticosteroids and, occasionally, bronchodilators. Post-treatment observation of these patients is necessary, and they should remain within ready access of emergency care for the following 48 hours.", 
    "57": "It is known that NO-dependent mechanisms are involved in mitochondrial adaptive reactions to different factors. The object of this study was to investigate the role of cholino- and adrenoreceptors in NO-dependent reactions of rat liver mitochondria to acute hypoxia (AH) and intermittent hypoxic training (IHT). Eight groups of Wistar male rats participated in the study. Animals of Gr. I underwent daily i.p. saline injections during 14 days. Gr. II was examined after a single AH test (inhalation of 7% O2, 30 min) with the same saline treatment. Another six groups were exposed to IHT (11% O2, 15-min sessions with 15 min rest intervals, 5 times daily during 14-days), at that 15 min before every IHT session animals underwent i.p. treatment: Gr. III and IV--saline, Gr. V--L-arginine, Gr. VI--NO synthase blocker L-NNA, Gr. VII--L-arginine with alpha-, beta-adrenoblockers phentolamine and obzidane, Gr. VIII--L-arginine with M- and N-cholinoreceptor blockers athropine and benzohexonium. After IHT Gr. IV-VIII were exposed to a single AH test and decapitated just after that. In control rats AH provoked: 1) in the presence of succinate, a 33% augmentation of ADP-stimulated mitochondrial respiration (V3) with a 18% decrease of O2 uptake efficiency (ADP/O ratio); 2) in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate, a NAD-dependent substrate, no changes in V3 were observed, also 21% augmentation of ADP/O ratio registered. These events were accompanied by 36% increase in succinate dehydrogenase (SDG) activity, two-fold augmentation of malon dialdehyde (MDA) content and 43% increase in diene conjugates (DK). IHT caused reorganization of mitochondrial energy metabolism improving the protection against acute hypoxia. A decrease by 40% in activation of mitochondrial respiration in the presence of succinate (V3--by 40% and V4--by 34%), a reduction of MDA and DK content (by 32% and 20%, respectively), an increase in SGD activity by 31% was observed in Gr. IY compared to Gr. II. Extra exogenous NO (Gr.Y) did not influence V3 and V4 in the presence of succinate, but in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate decreased them by 9% and 29%, respectively, as well as ADP/O ratio by 28% on the background of SDG inhibition by 24% and the decrease of MDA content by 34%, that is reduced aerobic energy supply and reactive oxygen species production. L-arginine effects were abolished by L-NNA. Effects of cholinoreceptor blockers over L-arginine (Gr. VIII) resembled effects of AH: considerable activation of succinate and alpha-ketoglutarate oxidation in stage V3 by 44% and 75%, respectively, was observed which was accompanied by a decrease in ADP/O by 21% and 31%, and V3/V4 by 15% and 28%, respectively, in comparison to Gr.Y. It indicates that effects of L-arginine are mediated mainly by cholinoreceptors. The effects of adrenoreceptors blockade strengthened the combined effects of IHT with L-arginine treatment, confirming primary role of cholinoreceptors in NO-dependent mitochondrial reactions to IHT. Thus, oxygen uptake and its effective usage depend on dynamic status of adreno- and cholinoreceptors. We conclude that protective effects of the combination of IHT with NO-donor treatment under acute hypoxia are mainly realized through cholinoreceptors.", 
    "58": "We reviewed the drug treatment of hypertension in the light of recent trials. beta-Blockers and diuretics clearly reduce mortality, strokes, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in hypertension. Recent trials assessed whether newer agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or calcium blockers, offer any additional advantage, or have benefits in high-risk individuals with conventionally 'normal' blood pressure. The recent ALLHAT study claimed no differences in CHD or mortality when chlorthalidone, amlodipine, and lisinopril were compared. However, the decrease in blood pressure was not the same with the three agents, and a substantial proportion of patients enrolled did not have clinical disease. In contrast, the LIFE study (comparing losartan and a beta-blocker) and the ANBP-2 study [comparing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and a diuretic] reduced blood pressure similarly, yet demonstrated benefits in favour of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE inhibitors. Other trials indicated similar advantages of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Among high-risk patients with initial blood pressure in the 'normal' range, ACE inhibitors significantly reduce clinical events (mortality, strokes, and myocardial infarction), despite modest decreases in blood pressure, suggesting that additional mechanisms are responsible. Recent results of the Prospective Studies Collaboration show lower risk, even in the normal blood pressure range; high-risk patients will benefit further from ACE inhibitors and ARBs (and beta-blockers after myocardial infarction). Data for other blood pressure decreasing agents are unavailable in such populations. We conclude that blood pressure decreasing per se is of clinical benefit, but drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system offer additional advantages. Drug choice is best determined by the patient's clinical condition.", 
    "59": "1. Blockers of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(Kr)) prolong cardiac action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP) in a reverse rate-dependent manner. Since activation of beta-adrenoceptors attenuates prolongation of APD evoked by I(Kr) blockers, rate-dependent neuronal noradrenaline liberation in the myocardium may contribute to the reverse rate-dependent nature of the effects of I(Kr) blockers. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of dofetilide, a pure I(Kr) blocker, on ERP after activation or blockade of beta-adrenoceptors and after catecholamine depletion in guinea-pig left atrial myocardium paced at 3, 2 and 1 Hz, in vitro. 2. Dofetilide (100 nM) lengthened ERP in a reverse rate-dependent manner in the left atrial myocardium of guinea-pigs. Strong activation of beta-adrenoceptors using 10 nM isoproterenol abolished the dofetilide-induced lengthening of ERP at all pacing rates. 3. Blockade of the beta-adrenoceptors with metoprolol (1 micro M), atenolol (3 micro M) or propranolol (300 nM) increased the dofetilide-evoked prolongation of ERP at 3 and 2 Hz, but not at 1 Hz. As a consequence, metoprolol attenuated while propranolol and atenolol fully eliminated the reverse rate-dependent nature of the dofetilide-induced ERP lengthening. In catecholamine-depleted atrial preparations of the guinea-pig (24 h pretreatment with 5 mg kg(-1) reserpine i.p.), the effect of dofetilide on ERP was not frequency dependent, and propranolol did not alter the effects of dofetilide. 4. In contrast to results obtained in guinea-pig atrial preparations, propranolol failed to change the reverse rate-dependent effect of dofetilide on ERP in the right ventricular papillary muscles of rabbits and guinea-pigs. 5. As an indication of the functional consequences of rate-dependent noradrenaline liberation, propranolol decreased twitch tension at 3 and 2 Hz but not at 1 Hz in the atrial myocardium of control guinea-pigs, whereas no such effect was detected in catecholamine-depleted atrial preparations. Propranolol failed to change contractility of ventricular myocardium in guinea-pigs and rabbits. 6. It is concluded that rate-dependent noradrenaline release and the ensuing beta-adrenoceptor activation contributed to the reverse rate-dependent nature of ERP prolongation caused by I(Kr) blockers in isolated guinea-pig atrial myocardium.", 
    "60": "1. Atypical beta-adrenoceptors resistant to propranolol, but blocked by bupranolol, increase contractile force and/or frequency of the heart in humans and rats. We compared the potencies of the enantiomers of bupranolol and examined the possible effects of seven bupranolol analogues including bevantolol (BEV) at this receptor in pithed and vagotomized rats. 2. CGP 12177, an agonist of the atypical beta-adrenoceptor, increased heart rate dose-dependently. Its dose-response curve was shifted to the right by S-(-)-bupranolol 10 micro mol kg(-1) by a factor of 8.4, but not affected by the same dose of R-(+)-bupranolol. 3. Desmethylbupranolol and compounds BK-21, BK-22, BK-23 and BK-25 also increased heart rate dose-dependently. The beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 given in combination with the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (0.1 micro mol kg(-1) each) reduced the positive chronotropic action of the five bupranolol analogues without affecting that of CGP 12177. The potencies of the bupranolol analogues to increase heart rate were correlated (r=0.91, P<0.05) with their affinities for beta(1)-adrenoceptor binding sites in rat brain cortex membranes labelled with [(3)H]CGP 12177 (in the presence of ICI 118,551). 4. BK-26 and BEV, 10 micro mol kg(-1) each, had only minor effects on heart rate by themselves and did not antagonize the effect of CGP 12177. However, at 1 micro mol kg(-1), they antagonized the increase in heart rate elicited by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol. 5. In conclusion, bupranolol is a stereoselective antagonist at the atypical cardiostimulant beta-adrenoceptor. The effects of the bupranolol analogues are related to the activation or blockade of beta(1)-adrenoceptors, but not of atypical beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "61": "There are now a number of guidelines outlining the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The extent to which these guidelines are used and the effects on patient outcomes are not well known. The aim of this study was to examine the implementation of a heart failure guideline among cardiologist and non-cardiologist physicians in a university hospital setting. Case record data were examined from 400 patients with a primary diagnosis of CHF. Management of these patients was assessed using a systolic heart failure guideline (Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, number 35) as a benchmark. Hospital admission data were examined contemporaneously over a 17-month period to assess associations between adherence to drug therapies and number of admissions. Overall, there was poor adherence to the guideline, with relatively high use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (80%), low use of beta-blockers (32%) and digoxin (36%), and very low use of spironolactone (13%). Cardiologists used more beta-blockers (37 vs. 21%, P=0.003) and digoxin in sinus rhythm (18 vs. 5%, P<0.001) than non-cardiologists. Hospital admission rate was individually associated with increasing age, NYHA status, beta-blocker, diuretic and spironolactone prescription (all P<0.001). At multivariable analysis, only age, NYHA status and increased diuretic prescription were associated with more frequent admission (P<0.001, R(2)=0.15). Despite carefully designed guidelines, the implementation of evidence-based therapies for CHF remains inadequate, even in a university hospital environment. This may reflect a lack of organisational developments to facilitate the increasingly complex management of patients with CHF.",

The COMPANION study, as previously reported, showed encouraging results for the use of cardiac resynchronisation and implantable defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure, but further evidence is awaited. The results of a study on tezosentan suggest that lower doses of this endothelin antagonist may be clinically more effective with fewer adverse effects compared with higher doses. The SHAPE survey of heart failure awareness in Europe identified a need for further heart failure education amongst the public, patients, their carers and primary care physicians.",

    "69": "This retrospective study is based on data sets of 28,065 patients recorded with a computerised anaesthesia record-keeping system from 23 February 1999 to 31 December 2000 at a tertiary care university hospital. Cases were defined as patients with intra-operative tachycardia; references were automatically selected according to matching variables (high-risk surgery, severe congestive heart failure, severe coronary artery disease, significant carotid artery stenosis and/or history of stroke, renal failure, diabetes mellitus and urgency of surgery) in a stepwise fashion. Main outcome measures were hospital mortality, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and prolonged hospital stay. Differences in outcome measures between the matched pairs were assessed by univariate analysis. Stepwise regression models were developed to predict the impact of intra-operative tachycardia on the different outcome measures.", 
    "70": "In our study 474 patients (1.7%) were found to have had intra-operative tachycardia. Matching was successful for 99.4% of the cases, leading to 471 cases and references. The crude mortality rates for the cases and matched references were 5.5% and 2.5%, respectively (P=0.020). Of all case patients, 22.3% were treated in an ICU, compared to 11.0% of the matched references (P=0.001). Hospital stay was prolonged in 25.1% of the patients with tachycardia compared to 15.1% of the matched references (P=0.001).", 
    "71": "In this study, patients with intra-operative tachycardia who were undergoing non-cardiac surgery had a greater peri-operative risk, leading to increased mortality, greater frequency of admission to an ICU and prolonged hospital stay.", 
    "72": "The ability of an antagonist to bind to a receptor is an innate property of that ligand-receptor chemical interaction. Provided no change in the antagonist or receptor chemical nature occurs, this affinity should remain constant for a given antagonist-receptor interaction, regardless of the agonists used. This fundamental assumption underpins the classification of receptors. Here, measurements of beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated cAMP accumulation and cAMP response-element (CRE)-mediated reporter-gene transcription revealed differences in antagonist affinity that depended upon agonist incubation time and the efficacy of the competing agonist. In cAMP accumulation studies (10-min agonist incubation), antagonist affinities were the same regardless of the agonist used. The CRE-reporter gene assay (5 h of incubation) antagonist affinities were 10-fold lower in the presence of isoprenaline and adrenaline than when salbutamol or terbutaline were present (e.g., log KD propranolol -8.65 +/- 0.08, n = 22, and -9.68 +/- 0.07, n = 17, for isoprenaline and salbutamol-induced responses, respectively). Isoprenaline and adrenaline were more efficacious in functional studies, and their ability to internalize GFP-tagged human beta2-adrenoceptors. Longer-term cAMP studies also showed significant differences in KD values moving toward that seen with gene transcription. Agonist-dependent differences in antagonist affinity were reduced for reporter-gene responses when a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of the beta2-adrenoceptor was used. This study suggests that high-efficacy agonists induce a chemical modification in beta2-adrenoceptors (via phosphorylation) that reduces antagonist affinities. Because reporter-gene assays are used for high-throughput screening in drug discovery, less efficacious or partial agonists may be more reliable than highly efficacious agonists when reporter-gene techniques are used to estimate antagonist affinity.", 
    "73": "Left atrial enlargement is a risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Large atrial size increases thromboembolic risk and reduces the success rate of cardioversion. The study aim was to evaluate if left atrial size reduction affects cardiac rhythm in patients with chronic AF undergoing mitral valve surgery.", 
    "74": "Twenty-seven patients were analyzed prospectively. The left atrial incision was extended to the left inferior pulmonary vein. Left atrial size reduction was achieved by closure of the left atrial appendage from inside with a double running suture. The same suture plicated the left lateral atrial wall to the roof of the left pulmonary vein inflow and the inferior atrial wall. The atrial septum was plicated by placing stitches of the closing suture line across the fossa ovalis. Rhythm, neurological complications, cardioversion, anticoagulation and anti-arrhythmic medication were evaluated at one year postoperatively and at recent follow up (mean 40 +/- 15 months).", 
    "75": "At discharge, five patients (19%) were in sinus rhythm (SR). At one year postoperatively, SR was restored in 17 patients (63%), but five (19%) reported episodes of arrhythmia and AF persisted in 10 (37%). At recent follow up, four patients had died and three were lost to follow up. Among 20 patients examined, 13 (65%) had SR but six reported episodes of arrhythmia and AF persisted in seven (35%). LA diameter was significantly reduced, from 60.2 +/- 9.8 mm preoperatively to 44.5 +/- 7.0 mm at one year after surgery.", 
    "76": "The addition of left atrial size reduction to mitral valve surgery is technically simple, and was effective in 63% of patients with chronic AF, restoring predominant SR.

Size reduction may also improve the outcome of other ablative approaches.", 
    "77": "In 2002, several studies were directed at new developments in the management of heart failure. In the COPERNICUS study, the previously reported benefits of the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker carvedilol regarding morbidity and mortality in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure were also found in patients with severe heart failure. Carvedilol not only improves survival but when given in addition to conventional therapy, ameliorates the severity of heart failure and reduces the risk of clinical deterioration, hospitalisation and other serious adverse events. The diagnostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients with congestive heart failure has been a topic of study for the past five years. Many questions still need to be answered but the results of a study by Maisel et al. show that BNP is not only of diagnostic value but is also important for prognosis and evaluation of therapy. A substudy of the Val-HeFT study focussed on the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker valsartan on BPN and noradrenaline levels. Valsartan significantly reduced the combined endpoint of mortality and morbidity and improved clinical signs and symptoms in patients with heart failure, if added to prescribed therapy. However, in a post-hoc observation an adverse effect on mortality and morbidity was seen in the subgroup receiving valsartan, an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocker, which raised concern about the potential safety of this specific combination. And finally, interesting work by Abraham et al. on cardiac resynchronisation through atrial-synchronised biventricular pacing clearly shows that this therapy can produce a significant clinical improvement in patients with moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure and intraventricular conduction delay.",

    "87": "Twenty-nine trials (approximately 2500 women) are included. Thirteen trials (1480 women) compared beta-blockers with placebo/no beta blocker. Oral beta-blockers decrease the risk of severe hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.53; 11 trials, N = 1128 women) and the need for additional antihypertensives (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 7 trials, N = 856 women). There are insufficient data for conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm birth. Beta-blockers seem to be associated with an increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 12 trials; N = 1346 women). Maternal hospital admission may be decreased, neonatal bradycardia increased and respiratory distress syndrome decreased, but these outcomes are reported in only a small proportion of trials. In 13 trials (854 women), beta-blockers were compared with methyldopa. Beta-blockers appear to be no more effective and probably equally as safe. Single small trials have compared beta-blockers with hydralazine, nicardipine or isradipine. It is unusual for women to change drugs due to side effects.",

The effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in SGA infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. Large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. If so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated.", 
    "89": "Acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a hormone produced by adipocytes and is of importance for the storage of energy as fat. We examined whether ASP might also have effects on islet function. In clonal INS-1 cells, ASP dose-dependently augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The lowest effective dose of ASP at 10 mmol/l glucose was 5 micro mol/l. The effect was glucose-dependent because ASP did not increase insulin secretion at 1 mmol/l glucose but had clear effect at 10 and 20 mmol/l glucose. Similarly, ASP augmented glyceraldehyde-induced insulin secretion but the hormone did not enhance insulin secretion in response to depolarization by 20 mmol/l of KCl. ASP-induced insulin secretion was completely abolished by competitive inhibition of glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase with 5-thio-glucose and was partially inhibited by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, and by the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203. Furthermore, thapsigargin, an inhibitor of Ca(2+)-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum, did not affect ASP-induced insulin secretion. ASP (>5 micro mol/l) also augmented glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islets isolated from C57BL/6J mice, and intravenous administration of ASP (50 nmol/kg) augmented the acute (1 and 5 min) insulin response to intravenous glucose (1 g/kg) in C57BL/6J mice. This was accompanied by an increased rate of glucose disposal. Minimal model analyses of data derived from the intravenous glucose tolerance test revealed that whereas ASP augmented insulin secretion, the hormone did not affect insulin sensitivity (S(I)) or glucose effectiveness (S(G)). We conclude that ASP augments glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through a direct action on the islet beta cells. The effect is dependent on glucose phosphorylation, calcium uptake and protein kinase C. Stimulation of insulin secretion by ASP in vivo results in augmented glucose disposal.", 
    "90": "Stress is usually correlated with an increased release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands. Within the hippocampus, a structure long known to be involved in spatial learning, two corticosterone-binding receptors are identified: the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Activation of these receptors impairs or facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), respectively. Stress elicited by behavioral manipulations may interfere with cognitive modulations of LTP during learning experiments. Here, we explore the influence of two stress-inducing procedures, handling and swimming, on the maintenance of dentate gyrus LTP in the rat induced by a weak tetanization of the perforant path. Manipulations started 15 min after tetanization. Handling alone resulted in a complete reversal of LTP. Handling followed by a 2 min swim in a water tank elicited prolonged protein synthesis but not beta-adrenergic-dependent LTP compared with either control or handled animals. Blockade of the GRs but not of the MRs prevented the reversal of LTP by handling. Inactivation of the MRs but not of the GRs hindered LTP prolongation by swimming. Because the activated receptor complexes act as transcription factors, MR- and GR-related proteins may play a role in the maintenance of LTP. The data suggest a complex interplay of corticosterone-binding receptors on modulations of hippocampal LTP and thus, of stress on learning and functional plasticity in general.",

The complexes were characterized by means of solubility measurements, release test at constant surface area, and water uptake measurements, and the results were related to their performance in controlled release formulations. For the more soluble complexes (involving metoprolol and tramadol) the occurrence of gelation after hydration was observed, while diltiazem complex apparently did not gellify; bupropion behavior was intermediate. A correspondence was found between the observed differences in complex solubility and hydration-gelation behavior and the drug release profiles. For all the drugs considered, the release was completed in about 10 to 12 hours, but different kinetics were observed depending on the solubility of the complexes. All the considered complexes seem suitable for controlled release purposes, although the data obtained show the relevance of the complex solubility to drug release profiles.",

At that, EPM response to the radiation coincides both with the direction and value of acting the beta-adrenoreceptor agonists depressing EPM. The EPM response to a combined action of beta-adrenoreceptors antagonist, propranolol (10 microM), and ionizing radiation is additive. The above listed is capable to evidence about the essential role of adrenoreceptors at formation of erythrocyte membrane surface charge under action of ionizing radiation in ultralow doses.",

Three-month-old (young group), 10-month-old (middle-age group), and 18-month-old (older group) F344/N male rats were used. The rats were fed either chow alone or chow in which 50% of the energy content was from substituted lard. Systolic BP (SBP) and body weights (BW) were determined weekly during each 7-week feeding period. A Steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) method was used to determine the insulin sensitivity. Bilateral testicular fat mass (epididymal fat; Epi-F) was removed in order to evaluate weight (Epi-FW). SBP began to increase at 2 weeks in the older lard-fed group, at 4 weeks in the middle-age lard-fed group, and at 5 weeks in the young lard-fed group after feeding was begun. There was no significant difference in the basal values of SBP among any ages-groups of the rats. After 4 weeks of lard feeding, increases in SBP, plasma insulin, leptin level, SSPG and Epi-FW/BW were observed in the older lard-fed group. In the younger rats, however, only hyperinsulinemia developed. At 7 weeks, increased BP in the younger rats was accompanied by increased plasma leptin level, SSPG and Epi-FW/BW. In summary, aging accelerates development of a dietary lard-induced increase in BP, which may be caused by the hyperleptinemia that may be the result of increased susceptibility to insulin resistance and/or visceral adiposity in older rats.",

This study sought to explore the effect of additional beta blockade on neurohumoral modulation in patients with severe heart failure (HF) who received ACE inhibitors. Forty-nine patients with chronic HF who received ACE inhibitors were given metoprolol 50 mg or carvedilol 25 mg twice daily after a 4-week dose titration period in addition to standard therapy in a prospective trial. Samples of plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, aminoterminal B-type natriuretic peptide (N-BNP), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were taken at baseline and at 4, 12, and 52 weeks after starting therapy. Treatment with either beta blocker significantly lowered PRA at 4 weeks compared with baseline (-2.0 +/- 0.6 nmol/L/hour, p = 0.006), but at 12 weeks, PRA had reduced to -1.1 +/- 0.6 nmol/L/hour (p = 0.08), but at 52 weeks, it was not significantly different from baseline (+1.05 +/- 0.6 nmol/L/hour, p = 0.13).

There was significant reduction in N-BNP and ANP together with an improvement in symptom and left ventricular systolic function at 1-year follow-up.

    "118": "Beta-blocking agents are a generally established therapy to achieve rate control in patients with AF. With the widely spread belief that rhythm control is the therapy of choice, their use is currently limited to patients that were considered not suitable for specific antiarrhythmic drug therapy. In contrast to that belief, recent studies show that beta-blockers do have some benefit in maintaining sinus rhythm or reducing the frequency of paroxysmal AF and that this benefit might be comparable to conventionally used antiarrhythmic drugs, with the exception of amiodarone. In addition, four prospectively randomized studies recently presented concluded that rate control may be an appropriate aim as a first line approach in patients with AF. Hence, an increased use of beta-blockers in the treatment of patients with AF is to be expected, given the proven prognostic benefit of these drugs in many cardiovascular disorders that are associated with AF. However, no prospective study has yet proven that beta-blockers do exert the same benefit in patients in AF, and one retrospective analysis suggests that there may be differences with regard to the potential benefits of beta-blocker therapy when patients are in AF compared to sinus rhythm.

    "119": "Local sequential conversion of estradiol to hydroxyestradiols and methoxyestradiols by CYP450 and catechol-O-methyltransferase, respectively, contributes to the antimitogenic effects of estradiol on glomerular mesangial cell growth via estrogen receptor-independent mechanisms. Catecholamines are also substrates for catechol-O-methyltransferase and therefore, might abrogate the renoprotective effects of estradiol by inhibiting formation of methoxyestradiols. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the antimitogenic effects of estradiol on human glomerular mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in the presence and absence of catecholamines. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol abrogated the inhibitory effects of estradiol on cell number, DNA synthesis, and collagen synthesis. For example, serum-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited from 100% to 62+/-1.9% by 0.1 micromol/L estradiol, and these inhibitory effects were reversed to 91+/-1.9% by 1 micromol/L epinephrine, 90.7+/-3.3% by 1 micromol/L isoproterenol, 87.5+/-2.8% by 10 micromol/L norepinephrine, and 92+/-1% by 10 micromol/L OR486 (catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor). The interaction of catecholamines with estradiol was not affected by phentolamine or propanolol, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively. Similar to estradiol, the antimitogenic effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol were abrogated by epinephrine, isoproterenol, and OR486. In contrast to estradiol and 2-hydroxyestradiol, the antimitogenic effects of 2-methoxyestradiol were not attenuated by epinephrine, isoproterenol, or OR486. Norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol inhibited the conversion of both estradiol and 2-hydroxyestradiol to 2-methoxyestradiol. Our findings suggest that catecholamines within the glomeruli might abrogate the antimitogenic effects of estradiol by blocking the conversion of 2-hydroxyestradiol to 2-methoxyestradiol.",

Common carotid artery IMT was determined with a high-definition echotracking system in 98 previously untreated hypertensive patients in a cross-sectional study.

Carotid IMT was higher in patients homozygous for the T allele than in MM patients. In the longitudinal study, the reduction in carotid IMT after antihypertensive treatment was significantly ( P <0.01) higher in patients carrying the TT genotype than in patients carrying the MM genotype, despite similar reductions in blood pressure and independently of drug type.

Compared to non-diabetic patients, diabetic patients were 5 years older, more often female, obese and hypertensive; they had more often a history of cardiovascular disease; they had a lower ejection fraction and worse Killip class. Reperfusion therapy was less frequent among diabetic patients (39% versus 51%; p=0.0001), as was the use of beta-blockers (61% versus 72%; p=0.0001), aspirin (83% versus 89%; p=0.0001) and statins (52% versus 60%; p=0.001) during hospitalization. Conversely, the use of ACE-inhibitors was more frequent (54% versus 44%; p=0.0001). 58% of diabetic patients received insulin during hospitalization.

    "140": "The monoamine noradrenaline (NA) can initiate and/or modulate locomotion in a variety of vertebrates. Here we report that exogenous NA application can facilitate two completely different fictive behaviours in embryos of the common frog Rana temporaria, depending on whether spinal networks are connected to supraspinal centres. When the nervous system is intact, NA elicits a non-rhythmic coiling motor response, reminiscent of a spontaneous behaviour appropriate to drive hatching movements, but has only minor effects on evoked swimming activity. After the spinal cord has been severed from the brain, spontaneous coiling is no longer observed, nor can NA elicit it, but the amine can 'release' swimming rhythm generation in response to electrical skin stimulation. The rhythm is similar, but relatively inflexible when compared to fictive swimming recorded from intact animals. Our pharmacological tests indicate that alpha 1-adrenoreceptors are involved in the permissive role of NA during spinalised rhythmic swimming and that the fictive coiling response to NA in intact animals involves descending inputs and the activation of beta 1-adrenoreceptors. Furthermore, the subtle effects of NA on evoked swimming in intact animals were mimicked by either alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoreceptor activation, reversibly decreasing motor burst durations and increasing their frequency. We discuss our results with reference to the known synergistic actions of NA with another aminergic neuromodulator, serotonin, and raise the possibility that these amines may actively regulate the release of one another during locomotion, in addition to their respective post-synaptic targets in the spinal cord.", 
    "141": "The regulation of cardiac function by catecholamines involves three populations of beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR). beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR stimulations produce an increase in contractility and beta(3)-AR stimulation mediates a negative inotropic effect in human ventricular muscle.

In basal conditions, TG beta(3) mice were characterized by an increase in heart rate and an acceleration of twitch parameters without modification of its amplitude. beta(3)-AR agonists (CL 316243, SR 58611A) decreased contractility at low concentrations (1-100 nM). At high concentrations, the negative inotropic effect was abolished. Pretreatment with nadolol, a beta(1)/beta(2)-AR blocker, blunted the rebound in peak tension elicited by beta(3)-AR agonists suggesting a non-specific action of these compounds on beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR. The involvement of beta(3)-AR in the negative inotropic effect was confirmed by the pretreatment with bupranolol, a non-selective beta-AR antagonist, which fully abolished the effects of SR 58611A.

Certain therapies were widely adopted in both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients (aspirin >94% of all patients; beta-blockers 85-95%) and changed only modestly over time. Significant increases in the use of low-molecular-weight heparins and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors occurred in STEMI and NSTEMI patients in advance of published practice guidelines (September/November 2000) with marked geographical differences. The highest use of LMWH was in Europe in NSTEMI (86.8%) and the lowest in the USA (24.0%). Contrasting geographical variations were seen in the use of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in NSTEMI: 39.5% USA, 34.6% Europe, 33.5% Argentina/Brazil, 25.0% Australia/New Zealand/Canada (July-December 2001).

Both solvent modifiers (TEA and SDS) prevent the interaction of the basic drugs with the alkyl-bonded phase. However, the protection mechanisms of silanols on the packing are different. Whereas TEA associates with the silanol sites (blocking ion-exchange processes or repelling the solutes), the long hydrophobic chain of SDS is inserted in the bonded organic layer with the sulfate group protruding outside, which makes the stationary phase negatively charged. The effects of TEA, acetonitrile, SDS, and propanol on the elution strength, efficiency, peak asymmetry, and resolution are examined under an experimental design basis that is assisted by computer simulation to reach more general conclusions. The combination of improved peak shapes, larger selectivity, and a smaller range in retention among compounds of extreme polarity leads to the observation that a greater number of beta-blockers can be resolved with a hybrid micellar system.",

    "157": "The possible interactions between inhibitory vagal control of the heart and circulating levels of catecholamines in dogfish (Squalus acanthias) were studied using an in situ preparation of the heart, which retained intact its innervation from centrally cut vagus nerves. The response to peripheral vagal stimulation typically consisted of an initial cardiac arrest, followed by an escape beat, leading to renewed beating at a mean heart rate lower than the prestimulation rate (partial recovery). Cessation of vagal stimulation led to a transient increase in heart rate, above the prestimulation rate. This whole response was completely abolished by 10(-4) M atropine (a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist). The degree of vagal inhibition was evaluated in terms of both the initial, maximal cardiac interval and the mean heart rate during partial recovery, both expressed as a percentage of the prestimulation heart rate. The mean prestimulation heart rate of this preparation (36+/-4 beats min(-1)) was not affected by noradrenaline but was significantly reduced by 10(-4) M nadolol (a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist), suggesting the existence of a resting adrenergic tone arising from endogenous catecholamines. The degree of vagal inhibition of heart rate varied with the rate of stimulation and was increased by the presence of 10(-8) M noradrenaline (the normal in vivo level in routinely active fish), while 10(-7) M noradrenaline (the in vivo level measured in disturbed or deeply hypoxic fish) reduced the cardiac response to vagal stimulation. In the presence of 10(-7) M noradrenaline, 10(-4) M nadolol further reduced the vagal response, while 10(-4) M nadolol + 10(-4) M phentolamine had no effect, indicating a complex interaction between adrenoreceptors, possibly involving presynaptic modulation of vagal inhibition.",

    "162": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an ATP-dependent integral plasma membrane efflux pump, expressed in abundance in brain capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes. P-gp contributes to the blood-brain barrier in limiting the influx and retention of a variety of lipophilic compounds, including unconjugated bilirubin. Several drugs block P-gp function and thereby enhance intracellular accumulation of P-gp substrates. In this study we proposed that pretreatment with drugs known to inhibit P-gp function in clinically relevant doses would alter the uptake of bilirubin in the brain of 32- to 36-d-old rats. In the first arm of the study, the animals received pretreatment with an i.v. infusion of either propanolol, erythromycin, verapamil, ceftriaxone, rifampin, or saline, 10 min before an i.v. bolus of 50 mg/kg bilirubin was given. Except for the erythromycin-treated rats, all treatment groups had significantly higher brain-to-serum bilirubin ratios than control animals (p < 0.05, Welch's t test). In the second arm of the study, treatment with either ceftriaxone or rifampin or saline i.v. preceded a 50 mg/kg i.v. bolus of radioactive bilirubin. Analysis of seven different brain regions by scintillation counting showed that the distribution patterns differed significantly between the study groups (p < 0.001, ANOVA), however, not in accordance with a kernicteric staining pattern. Because of limited knowledge of expression and function of P-gp and other membrane transport proteins in the newborn, the implications of this study remain to be seen. We speculate that drugs known to inhibit P-gp function may increase the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy in the hyperbilirubinemic infant.",

Patients with glaucoma may require long-term administration of intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering medications. These medications belong to several classes of molecules including beta-adrenergic blockers, cholinergic agents, alpha-adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and ocular hypotensive lipids. Most adverse effects associated with IOP-lowering medications are mild and ocular in nature; however, several of them are associated with systemic risks as well as serious ocular effects, especially following chronic use. The following review discusses the acute and long-term effects of commonly used IOP-lowering medications.", 
    "168": "Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has proven very useful in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) and progressive renal failure. More recently, agents that directly block the angiotensin II Type 1 (AT(1)) receptor--angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs)--have been developed. These agents are thought to have a more specific mechanism of action since they do not affect other hormone systems as do the ACE inhibitors. Whether such specificity results in a different efficacy profile is still being determined. However, these drugs are extremely well-tolerated and very safe. AIIRAs are effective in the reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and compare favourably to other classes of agents. Recent results indicate that at least one AIIRA has a favourable effect on stroke in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Additional studies with other members of the class will provide further information on similar outcomes. In CHF patients, ACE inhibitors remain the drug of choice and AIIRAs are best utilised in patients who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor or in those receiving an ACE inhibitor who cannot tolerate a beta-blocker and need additional therapy. AIIRAs are effective in slowing the progression of renal failure in patients with Type II diabetes and may be effective in other proteinuric conditions. Whether they are more or less effective than ACE inhibitors is unknown. Overall, AIIRAs represent an important addition to the armamentarium of cardiovascular therapies with an excellent safety record and an emerging profile of utility in multiple cardiovascular conditions.", 
    "169": "Carvedilol (Dilatrend) blocks beta(1)-, beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, and has antioxidant and antiproliferative effects. Carvedilol improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in numerous studies. Moreover, significantly greater increases from baseline in LVEF were seen with carvedilol than with metoprolol in a double-blind, randomised study and in a meta-analysis. Carvedilol also reversed or attenuated left ventricular remodelling in patients with CHF and in those with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Combined analysis of studies in the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trials Program (patients had varying severities of CHF; n = 1094) revealed that mortality was significantly lower in carvedilol than in placebo recipients. In addition, the risk of hospitalisation for any cardiovascular cause was significantly lower with carvedilol than with placebo. Mortality was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with mild to severe CHF in the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) [n = 3029]. The Carvedilol Prospective Randomised Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial (n = 2289) demonstrated that compared with placebo, carvedilol was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality and the combined endpoint of death or hospitalisation for any reason in severe CHF. All-cause mortality was reduced in patients who received carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy compared with those who received placebo plus conventional therapy in the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in LV Dysfunction (CAPRICORN) trial (enrolling 1959 patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute MI). Carvedilol was generally well tolerated in patients with CHF. Adverse events associated with the alpha- and beta-blocking effects of the drug occurred more commonly with carvedilol than with placebo, whereas placebo recipients were more likely to experience worsening heart failure. In conclusion, carvedilol blocks beta(1)-, beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and has a unique pharmacological profile. It is thought that additional properties of carvedilol (e.g. antioxidant and antiproliferative effects) contribute to its beneficial effects in CHF. Carvedilol improves ventricular function and reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with mild to severe CHF, and should be considered a standard treatment option in this setting. Administering carvedilol in addition to conventional therapy reduces mortality and attenuates myocardial remodelling in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following acute MI. Moreover, mortality was significantly lower with carvedilol than with metoprolol in patients with mild to severe CHF, suggesting that carvedilol may be the preferred beta-blocker.",

As hyperthermia is considered to be one of the most life-threatening acute physiological consequences of amphetamine-related intoxications, it was our aim to determine whether 4-MTA induces changes in body temperature in a mouse model. Accordingly, we measured the subcutaneous temperature after acute administration of 4-MTA in CD1 mice. Because hyperthermia seems to result from the central and peripheral actions of catecholamines and serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine or 5-HT), we also investigated the possible interactions of some catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor blockers and the inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) with this effect. 4-MTA induced hyperthermia in CD1 mice. Blockade of the 5-HT receptors with methysergide and MAO inhibition with pargyline resulted in the potentiation of the 4-MTA-induced hyperthermic effect. Blockade of the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors with prazosin completely reverted the 4-MTA-induced hyperthermia while with the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker dl-propranolol this reversal was not complete. Blockade of the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors with yohimbine had no effect on the hyperthermia induced by 4-MTA. These results suggest that 4-MTA-induced hyperthermia is highly influenced by the catecholaminergic and serotonergic receptor activation and the MAO activity."
