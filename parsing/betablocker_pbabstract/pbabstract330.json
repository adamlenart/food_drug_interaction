    "0": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are both common conditions associated with a high morbidity and mortality. When the two conditions occur together, as they do in 50% of diabetic individuals, the result is a 7.2-fold increase in mortality. If hypertension occurs in association with diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, mortality rises to 37-fold above that of a healthy population. Despite the increase in incidence of nephropathy, cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of death in diabetic individuals. Therapy should therefore take into consideration the results of large, placebo-controlled trials which have shown reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as a result of active treatment. Although studies with the newer antihypertensive agents such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are ongoing, only diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have been clearly shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Despite concerns regarding adverse metabolic effects and loss of hypoglycaemic awareness, beta-blockers and diuretics do have a role in the management of diabetic patients. While it is clear that ACE inhibitors reduce the progression of diabetic nephropathy, evidence suggests that diuretics may be just as effective. However, unlike diuretics or beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors have no proven benefit in the prevention of stroke of myocardial infarction. Despite the claims of metabolic neutrality made for many antihypertensive agents there appears to be no advantage in their use in the majority of hypertensive diabetic patients, except where there exist specific contraindications to established therapies.", 
    "1": "This study evaluates the hypothesis that in patients with syncope of unknown origin and heart anomalies, inducible ventricular arrhythmias are specific arrhythmias and therefore should be treated as such.", 
    "2": "Although syncope is a frequent clinical entity, the evaluation and treatment of patients with syncope without a clear etiology still remains undefined. Many patients with syncope of undetermined origin undergo invasive electrophysiologic evaluation. Abnormalities of the sinus node, prolongation of conduction times or inducible arrhythmias found during these evaluations are usually assumed to be the cause of syncope, and are consequently treated. However, whether tachyarrhythmias are truly the cause of syncope, and whether treatment of these tachyarrhythmias can prevent recurrent syncope and arrhythmic death, is unknown.", 
    "3": "An electrophysiological study was performed on 160 patients with structural heart disease and syncope of unknown origin. In 23 out of the 160 patients (16%), programmed electrical stimulation induced sustained ventricular arrhythmias. In 18 out of the 23 patients an automatic defibrillator was implanted and they form the study group.", 
    "4": "In these 18 patients, programmed ventricular stimulation induced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in 12, sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 2 and ventricular fibrillation in 4. During a mean follow-up of 14 months, 9 patients received 81 appropriate therapies from the device (53 because of ventricular tachycardia and 23 because of ventricular fibrillation). The probability of appropriate therapy was 100% at 1 year follow-up. There were no episodes of sudden death and 1 patient died of congestive heart failure.", 
    "5": "In patients with syncope of undetermined origin, heart disease and inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias treated with a implantable cardioverter defibrillator, there is a high incidence of appropriate therapies. Our results support the practice of using implantable cardioverter defibrillators in patients with syncope of unknown origin, heart disease and inducible ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "6": "The differential rate of growth of the left-ventricular free wall (LVFW) and the right-ventricular free wall (RVFW) of the newborn pig has been studied by measuring the rates of ribosome formation and protein synthesis in the isolated perfused heart. These measurements are limited by the heterogeneity of the cells and the stability of the preparation. The hypothesis of the present study was that isolated cultured myocytes would offer much less cellular heterogeneity and a more prolonged period to explore the actions of anabolic agents. The rate of [3H] phenylalanine incorporation into total protein during 24 h of culture was established as a monitor of the rate of protein synthesis in myocytes and was found to be 64 and 61% of the rates measured in the LVFW and RVFW, respectively, of the perfused heart. The relative rates of protein synthesis in LVFW and RVFW were the same in myocytes and perfused hearts. Myocytes from the LVFW had increased rates of protein synthesis after exposure to a combination of norepinephrine and propranolol or endothelin for 24 h. Exposure to endothelin for 3 days increased rates of protein synthesis to a greater extent in LVFW myocytes than in RVFW myocytes. In LVFW myocytes from enalapril-treated pigs or in LVFW myocytes exposed to 40 mM KCl, angiotensin II increased the rate of protein synthesis by 14% during the third day of incubation. These studies indicated that cultured myocytes reflected the rates of protein synthesis observed in LVFW and RVFW of the perfused piglet heart. Differential effects of an alpha-adrenergic agonist, endothelin and angiotensin II in LVFW as compared to RVFW myocytes was observed. In each case, the response to the agonist was decreased or absent in RVFW as compared to LVFW myocytes.", 
    "7": "Vasodilation by beta-adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle cells appears to be impaired early after the onset of hypercholesteremia. The aim of this study was to analyze the modulation of beta-adrenergic receptor density and adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of moderately elevated concentrations of LDL. The effects of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists on LDL-induced receptor changes were studied.", 
    "8": "Media explants of porcine coronary arteries were incubated with moderately elevated LDL concentrations (0.7-3.9 mmol/l). The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was determined in plasma membranes using the radioligand [125I]iodocyanopinodolol. LDL (3.9 mmol/l) resulted in a decrease of beta-adrenergic receptor density (control 137 +/- 5 vs. 89 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein, P < 0.01). After removal of LDL and cultivation for an additional 3 days beta-adrenergic receptors increased to 129 +/- 5 fmol/mg. In the presence of the beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists the LDL-mediated decrease was inhibited. Addition of metoprolol after 3 days of LDL incubation caused a restoration of receptor density. The basal, isoproterenol- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were increased after LDL incubation by 180, 110 or 80%, respectively.", 
    "9": "Moderately elevated LDL levels decreased beta-adrenergic receptor density while adenylyl cyclase activity was simultaneously increased. beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptor antagonists prevented this receptor decrease and might preserve the beta-adrenergic receptor density in the presence of moderately elevated LDL levels.", 
    "10": "Although heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is thought to produce hypertrophy in isolated cardiomyocytes via an autocrine mechanism, the pathophysiological role of HB-EGF, in myocardial hypertrophy in vivo, is not yet known. To investigate the involvement of HB-EGF in cardiac remodeling associated with hypertension in vivo, we assayed the expression of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in the left ventricle (LV) during the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", 
    "11": "Prior to sacrifice and assay of HB-EGF and EGF-receptor (EGF-R) mRNA, morphologic and hemodynamic variables were measured in SHR and in age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). At 5, 9 and 12 weeks of age, rats were killed, their hearts were removed, and the expression of HB-EGF and EGF-R mRNA and protein were measured. In addition, SHR and WKY were treated with enalapril, atenolol, or both for 4 weeks.", 
    "12": "In untreated SHR, double products (i.e. systolic blood pressure (sBP) multiplied by heart rate (HR), an index of mechanical load, peaked at 9 weeks. Expression of HB-EGF mRNA was also observed to peak in these animals at 9 weeks, while expression of EGF-R mRNA increased from 5 to 9 weeks, but remained constant thereafter. In untreated WKY, double products and EGF-R mRNA expression did not change over time, whereas the level of HB-EGF message increased gradually. Antibody to HB-EGF reacted primarily with myocyte membranes in SHR, whereas antibody to EGF-R reacted mainly with interstitial cells in these animals. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, markedly decreased sBP in SHR, whereas the beta 1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, atenolol, significantly decreased HR. While neither alone affected the expression of HB-EGF mRNA, their combination significantly reduced the expression of HB-EGF mRNA, as well as double products, in these rats, but had no effect on expression of EGF-R mRNA.", 
    "13": "The enhanced expression of HB-EGF mRNA and protein in LV of SHR suggest that this growth factor may play an important role during the early development of LV hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in SHR. The association between double products and HB-EGF expression suggest that the latter may be induced by increased mechanical load and may contribute, in turn, to cardiac remodeling.", 
    "14": "The aims of this study were to determine the relationships between oscillations in systolic blood pressure and heart period at different breathing frequencies and to investigate the role of sympathetic contribution to this relationship.", 
    "15": "Fourteen healthy volunteers underwent three randomized periods of controlled breathing at 6, 10 and 16 breaths/min. ECG (RR), respiratory signal (RESP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were continuously recorded. The component of RR and SBP oscillations related to respiration (RRResp and SBPResp) was defined by means of uni- and bivariate spectral analysis. The squared coherence (K2) and phase between RR and RESP, and RR and SBP (RR-SBP) were also assessed. When the K2 of RR-SBP in the respiratory band was > 0.5, we considered the phase and calculated the closed-loop gain between the two signals. Seven subjects were also studied after chronic metoprolol treatment.", 
    "16": "Although the mean values of RR and SBP did not differ between the three periods of breathing, the higher the respiratory rate, the smaller the RRResp and SBPResp. The phase was always negative (SBPResp changes preceded RRResp changes), thus suggesting a baroreflex link. The higher the respiratory rate, the lower the gain and phase. Pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor blockade increased the gain and shifted the phase, but the relationships found at baseline between the respiratory rate and both the gain and phase remained unchanged.", 
    "17": "The effect of breath rate on the relationship between heart rate and systolic pressure variabilities is a frequency-dependent phenomenon that is also independent of the sympathetic drive.", 
    "18": "Long-term administration of beta-adrenergic blockers to patients after myocardial infarction improves survival. However, physicians are reluctant to administer beta-blockers to many patients, such as older patients and those with chronic pulmonary disease, left ventricular dysfunction, or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.", 
    "19": "The medical records of 201,752 patients with myocardial infarction were abstracted by the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project, which was sponsored by the Health Care Financing Administration. Using a Cox proportional-hazards model that accounted for multiple factors that might influence survival, we compared mortality among patients treated with beta-blockers with mortality among untreated patients during the two years after myocardial infarction.", 
    "20": "A total of 34 percent of the patients received beta-blockers. The percentage was lower among the very elderly, blacks, and patients with the lowest ejection fractions, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, elevated serum creatinine concentrations, or type 1 diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, mortality was lower in every subgroup of patients treated with beta-blockade than in untreated patients. In patients with myocardial infarction and no other complications, treatment with beta-blockers was associated with a 40 percent reduction in mortality. Mortality was also reduced by 40 percent in patients with non-Q-wave infarction and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Blacks, patients 80 years old or older, and those with a left ventricular ejection fraction below 20 percent, serum creatinine concentration greater than 1.4 mg per deciliter (124 micromol per liter), or diabetes mellitus had a lower percentage reduction in mortality. Given, however, the higher mortality rates in these subgroups, the absolute reduction in mortality was similar to or greater than that among patients with no specific risk factors.", 
    "21": "After myocardial infarction, patients with conditions that are often considered contraindications to beta-blockade (such as heart failure, pulmonary disease, and older age) and those with nontransmural infarction benefit from beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "22": "Primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) complicating acute myocardial infarction (MI) predicts short-term mortality. The broad category of patients with primary VF might include subgroups with different outcomes. It is still not certain whether early-onset (< or =4 hours) primary VF is a risk predictor, and information on correlates of these early fibrillations is scarce. This study sought to prospectively analyze the incidence and prognosis of early, as opposed to late (time window >4 to 48 hours) primary VF and retrospectively identify predisposing factors for early-onset primary VF. We analyzed the incidence and recurrence rate of early and late primary VF in 9,720 patients with a first acute MI, treated with thrombolytics, enrolled in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI)-2 trial. The independent prognostic significance of early and late primary VF was assessed by logistic regression analysis. The incidence rates of early and late primary VF were 3.1% and 0.6%, respectively; recurrence rates were 11% and 15%, respectively. The 2 variables most closely related to early primary VF were hypokalemia and systolic blood pressure < 120 mm Hg on admission. Patients with early primary VF had a more complicated in-hospital course than matched controls. Both early (odds ratio [OR] 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48 to 4.13) and late primary VF (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.51 to 10.48) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Postdischarge to 6-month death rates were similar for both primary VF subgroups and controls. Primary VF, irrespective of its timing, was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Postdischarge to 6-month prognosis was unaffected by the occurrence of either early or late primary VF.",

    "26": "Although, there was little difference in baseline characteristics and hospital treatments between cohorts, MC patients were more likely to be discharged on guideline-recommended medications (aspirin and beta-adrenergic blocking agents). In addition, FFS patients were more likely to undergo cardiac catheterization (odds ratio = 1.25 95% confidence interval = 1.1 to 1.5), but not revascularization during the hospitalization. There was no difference in hospital mortality (0.9% versus 1.2% in MC versus FFS; p = 0.60).",

Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or =40% or evidence of congestive heart failure while in the hospital were discharged with ACE inhibitor treatment 42.6% of the time. Of patients experiencing an anterior wall myocardial infarction and no evidence of heart failure, 26.1% of patients were discharged with this treatment. Of the remaining patients, 15.6% received ACE inhibitors at discharge. ACE inhibitors were prescribed more often to elderly and diabetic patients as well as those requiring intraaortic balloon pump placement.

Several drugs infused immediately post-training inhibited STM without altering LTM: the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 (7.5 microgram) given into either CA1 or EC, the beta blocker timolol (0.3 microgram) given into EC, the 5HT1A receptor agonist 8-HO-DPAT (2.5 microgram) given into CA1, and the 5HT1A antagonist NAN-190 (2.5 microgram) given into EC. These findings indicate that STM is not a necessary step toward LTM. Intraentorhinal 8-HO-DPAT enhanced STM and depressed LTM. The D1 antagonist SCH23390 (0.5 microgram) enhanced STM without affecting LTM when given into CA1, and blocked LTM without affecting STM when given into EC. Intraentorhinal norepinephrine (0.3 microgram) enhanced both STM and LTM, and the same drug when given into CA1 enhanced LTM selectively. None of the drugs had any effect on retrieval of either STM or LTM when given prior to testing. The data indicate that STM and LTM are differentially modulated by D1, beta, and 5HT1A receptors in CA1 and EC.",

No stereoselective pharmacokinetic differences were observed between total (bound and unbound) and unbound (R)- and (S)-propranolol. The AUC(0-720) of (R)-propranolol was significantly higher when administered as a racemic mixture than when given as a pure enantiomer (p < 0.01), suggesting the disposition of (R)-propranolol may be influenced by (S)-propranolol.",

    "39": "In pentobarbital-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats, pial vessel diameters were measured with the use of a cranial window preparation. We studied the effects of (1) 60 puffs per minute of mainstream cigarette smoke from cigarettes having 2 nicotine levels (0.1 and 1 mg per cigarette), (2) administration of nicotine (0.05 mg per body IV), and (3) repeated smoking (four 1 mg nicotine-containing cigarettes at 30-minute intervals) (n=6 each).", 
    "40": "Inhalation of smoke from a 0.1 or 1 mg nicotine-containing cigarette for 1 minute caused pial arterioles to constrict at 30 seconds (7.2% and 7.3%, respectively) and then to dilate (peak at 5 to 10 minutes; 4.6% and 17.9%, respectively). Nicotine infusion caused pial vasodilation (35.7%) without an initial vasoconstriction. Repeated smoking suppressed the pial vasodilation but not the initial vasoconstriction. The vasodilation induced by a single cigarette was greatly inhibited by pretreatment with mecamylamine or glibenclamide and attenuated by propranolol or Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester; the initial vasoconstriction was inhibited by seratrodast, a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist (n=6 in each case).", 
    "41": "Single-cigarette smoking had a significant biphasic effect on cerebral arteriolar tone. The vasodilation was attenuated by repeated smoking. The vasodilation is most likely an effect of nicotine, at least in part mediated via sympathetic activation, NO production, and K+ channel activation. The vasoconstriction is partially due to thromboxane A2 induced by cigarette smoke.", 
    "42": "To evaluate the relationship between the distribution of hypertrophy and the electrocardiographic findings in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 54 HCM patients were studied using magnetic resonance imaging. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to hypertrophic patterns: (i) hypertrophy only at the apex (group I, n=12); (ii) hypertrophy in both the apex and base (group II, n=20); (iii) hypertrophy only at the base with asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) (group IIIa, n=17); and (iv) hypertrophy only at the base without ASH (group IIIb, n=5). Abnormal Q waves in leads II, III and aVF were found in 1/12, 3/20, 10/17 and 0/5, respectively, and in leads I and aVL they were found in 1/12, 8/20, 4/17 and 1/5, respectively. The largest negative T waves (mm) were found in group I (group I vs group II vs group IIIa vs group IIIb: 15.2+/-5.3, 8.2+/-6.1, 1.6+/-2.0, 0.8+/-1.3, respectively). The largest positive T waves (mm) were identified in group IIIb (3.8+/-3.0, 6.8+/-3.2, 5.8+/-3.6, 9.3+/-2.1, respectively). The presence of abnormal Q waves reflected regional hypertrophy in HCM patients but the configuration of T waves represented the difference in the localization of hypertrophy between the basal and apical segments.", 
    "43": "The first case report of gingival overgrowth induced by nifedipine (NIF), a calcium-beta blocker, was in 1984. However, the association between gingival alterations and the drug therapy of sodium diphenyl hydantoinate was initially described in 1939. The purpose of the experimental study was to examine the effect of NIF on gingival morphology in an animal model. Forty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Animals in each group daily received NIF in dimethyl sulfoxide by gastric feeding at a dosage of 0 (control), 30, or 50 mg/kg body weight for 9 weeks. Gingival gross morphology was assessed tri-weekly from stone models obtained from the mandibular incisal region. Animals were sacrificed at the end of study and tissue blocks were processed for histopathologic and histometric evaluation. Histometric analysis was performed at 5 selected tissue levels. Macro- and microscopic significantly increased gingival dimensions were demonstrated in NIF-treated animals compared to control. Although a fibrovascular tissue was observed in the tooth-gingiva interface for both NIF-treated and control animals, it was thicker and appeared earlier in NIF-treated animals. The results of the present study suggest that gingival overgrowth can be induced by NIF in rats and that the gingival overgrowth appears dose dependent.",

    "49": "1. The lungs of two groups of lambs aged 0-2 weeks and 6-12 weeks were artificially perfused in situ with warmed and oxygenated sheep blood. The airspaces of the lungs were filled with liquid containing an impermeant tracer to allow estimation of net liquid movement across the pulmonary epithelium at rest and after administration of certain drugs. 2. Dibutyryl cAMP (dB-cAMP, 10-4 M) stimulated the rate of lung liquid (LL) absorption in the lungs of four neonatal sheep aged 9-12 days, from -1.43 +/- 0.2 to -2.75 +/- 0.3 ml h-1 (kg body wt)-1 (P < 0.05, comparison of regression lines by Student's t test), but had no effect in four juvenile sheep aged 6-12 weeks (P > 0.10). 3. Theophylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor (5 x 10-4 M), increased LL absorption from a resting rate of -1.55 +/- 0.3 to -3.62 +/- 0.5 ml h-1 kg-1 in the lungs of four sheep aged 1-12 days and from -1.47 +/- 0.3 to -3.73 +/- 0.4 ml h-1 kg-1 in four sheep aged 6-12 weeks (P < 0.05, Student's paired t test). 4. The beta-adrenergic antagonist sotalol (10-4 M) reduced LL absorption rate from -1.47 +/- 0.1 to -1.22 +/- 0.1 ml h-1 kg-1 (P < 0.01) in the lungs of four sheep aged 4-13 days, while theophylline given after sotalol had no effect. In four sheep aged 6-12 weeks, sotalol had no effect on LL absorption rate, whereas theophylline given after sotalol increased LL absorption rate from -1.06 +/- 0.1 to -1.92 +/- 0.2 ml h-1 kg-1 (P < 0.05). 5. The A1/A2 purinergic receptor blocker 7-(beta-chloroethyl) theophylline (CET; given at 5 x 10-6 M and 10-4 M) had no effect on LL absorption rate in the lungs of four sheep aged 6-12 weeks, confirming that theophylline produced its effect of increasing LL absorption by inhibiting PDE hydrolytic activity. 6. The selective PDE IV (cAMP-specific) PDE inhibitor rolipram was given in the perfused lungs of seven sheep aged 6-12 weeks at doses between 10-8 and 10-4 M, increasing LL absorption rate at concentrations of 10-6 M and above; the half-maximal effective concentration was estimated to be 5.9 x 10-7 M. 7. Rolipram (10-5 M) increased LL absorption rate from -1.99 +/- 0.2 to -3.18 +/- 0.5 ml h-1 kg-1 in the perfused lungs of four sheep aged 6-11 days, and from -1.21 +/- 0.4 to -3.45 +/- 0.3 ml h-1 kg-1 in the perfused lungs of four sheep aged 6-12 weeks (P < 0.05). Sotalol (10-4 M) reduced LL absorption rate from -3.39 +/- 0.8 to -2. 18 +/- 0.4 ml h-1 kg-1 (P < 0.05) in four sheep aged 10-14 days, while rolipram given after sotalol had no effect. In four sheep aged 6-12 weeks, sotalol had no effect on resting LL absorption rate, whereas rolipram given after sotalol increased absorption rate from -1.27 +/- 0.1 to -2.02 +/- 0.6 ml h-1 kg-1 (P < 0.05). 8. We conclude that cAMP mediates a component of LL absorption postnatally, and that while beta-adrenergic stimulation was the sole source of endogenous cAMP in neonates, this was not the case in juveniles, in whom cAMP originated, at least in part, from other sources.", 
    "50": "1. We recently cloned a putative chloride channel (xClC-5) from the renal cell line A6, which induced the appearance of a Cl- conductance not found in control oocytes after homologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. With the aim of increasing the Xenopus oocyte xClC-5 expression, we constructed a new plasmid in which the native 5' and 3' non-coding regions of xClC-5 were replaced by the non-coding regions of the Xenopus beta-globin sequence and in which a Kozak consensus site was introduced before the initiator ATG. 2. We then compared the induced currents Inative (induced by injection of cRNA presenting the native non-coding regions of xClC-5) and Ibeta-globin (induced by injection of cRNA presenting the non-coding regions of the Xenopus beta-globin sequence) investigating anion selectivity and anion blocker sensitivity. Several differences were found: (1) expression yield and oocyte surviving rate were largely increased by injecting (beta) xClC-5 cRNA, (2) the Ibeta-globin outward rectification score was 2.6 times that of Inative, (3) the anion conductivity sequence was nitrate > bromide > chloride > iodide > gluconate for Ibeta-globin and iodide > bromide > nitrate > chloride > gluconate for Inative, (4) 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB), anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (9-AC), DIDS, lanthanum ions, cAMP and ionomycin-induced [Ca2+]i increase inhibited Inative but had no effect on Ibeta-globin, and (5) Inative showed considerable similarity to the previously reported endogenous current appearing after ClC-6 or pICln cRNA injection. 3. Comparison of Inative with the endogenous chloride current ICl,swell which develops under hyposmotic conditions demonstrated several similarities in their electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics but were nevertheless distinguishable. 4. In vitro translation assays demonstrated that protein synthesis was much greater using the (beta) xClC-5 construct than that of xClC-5. Furthermore, immunoreactivity of membrane preparations of Xenopus oocytes was only observed with the (beta) xClC-5 construct, its intensity being positively correlated with Ibeta-globin levels. 5. In addition, the current induced in (beta) xClC-5 cRNA-injected oocytes presented a very marked pH dependence (inhibition by acid external media) with a pKa value (negative log of the acid dissociation constant) of 5.67. 6. In conclusion, Ibeta-globin may be due to the presence of xClC-5 in the oocyte plasma membrane playing a role as an anion channel whereas Inative may represent an endogenous current induced by xClC-5 cRNA injection. The use of antibodies will facilitate the tissue and subcellular localization of xClC-5 and the identification of its physiological role.", 
    "51": "1. The effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation on the motility of the circular and longitudinal muscle of the large intestine were investigated in vitro, and the involvement of various adrenoceptor subtypes determined. A comparison between the sympathetic supply arising from the prevertebral and pelvic ganglia was also made. 2. In the longitudinal muscle of the distal colon, sympathetic nerve stimulation caused responses which were contractile (0.1-2 Hz), biphasic (5-10 Hz) or purely inhibitory (20-30 Hz). All contractile responses were removed with phentolamine (3 microM), whereas the inhibitory responses were significantly diminished by propranolol (0.1 microM) and completely abolished by alprenolol (3 microM) or nadolol (300 microM). 3. In the longitudinal muscle of the proximal colon, the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation were predominantly inhibitory. Some of this inhibition was removed by propranolol (0.1 microM), but was largely unaffected by alprenolol (3 microM). The remainder of the inhibitory response was probably non-noradrenergic as it was not removed by a combination of phentolamine (3 microM) and alprenolol (3 microM). 4. In the circular muscle of both the proximal and distal colon, sympathetic stimulation caused a strong contractile response which was completely removed by phentolamine (3 microM) to reveal an inhibitory response. This inhibitory response was unchanged by propranolol (0.1 microM) but was removed by alprenolol (3 microM), following which a weak non-noradrenergic contractile response was unmasked. 5. Stimulation of the hypogastric nerve to activate pelvic sympathetic pathways had no effect on the motility of the longitudinal muscle, but caused a contractile response in the circular muscle which was completely removed by phentolamine (3 microM). 6. We conclude that sympathetic nerves innervate adrenoceptors of different types in the various muscle layers and regions of the colon. They innervate a mixture of alpha-, and beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the longitudinal muscle of the proximal colon, alpha-, classical beta- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the distal colon, and primarily alpha-adrenoceptors with a few beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the circular muscle. In addition, the pelvic sympathetic innervation of the rectum differs from the prevertebral supply by innervating only excitatory alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "52": "1. We examined the relationship between calcineurin (protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) and voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCCs) in NG108-15 cells. PP2B expression in NG108-15 cells was altered by transfection with plasmid constructs containing a full length cDNA of human PP2B beta(3) in sense (CN-15) and antisense (CN-21) orientation. 2. Confocal immunocytochemical localization showed that in wild-type cells, PP2B immunoreactivity is uniformly distributed in undifferentiated cells and located at the inner surface of soma membrane and neurites in differentiated cells. 3. To test the Ca2+ dependence of the VOCC, we used high-frequency stimulation (HFS). The L- and N-type VOCCs decreased by 37 and 52%, respectively, whereas the T-type current was only marginally sensitive to this procedure. FK-506 (2 microM), a specific blocker of PP2B, reduced the inhibition of L- and N-type VOCCs induced by HFS by 30 and 33%, respectively. 4. In CN-15-transfected cells overexpressing PP2B, total high-voltage-activated (HVA) VOCCs were suppressed by about 60% at a test potential of +20 mV. Intracellular addition of EGTA or FK-506 into CN-15-transfected cells induced an up to 5-fold increase of HVA VOCCs. 5. These findings indicate that PP2B activity does not influence the expression of HVA Ca2+ channels, but modulates their function by Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation. Thus HVA VOCCs, in a phosphorylated state under control conditions, are downregulated by PP2B upon stimulation, with the major effect on N-type VOCCs.", 
    "53": "The medical treatment of portal hypertension has experienced marked progress in the past decade due to the production of effective portal hypertension therapy. This has been possible because of the better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to portal hypertension. A major step forward was the introduction of beta-blockers for the prevention of bleeding and rebleeding from gastroesophageal varices. Effective therapy requires the reduction of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) to 12 mm Hg or below, or at least by 20% of baseline values. Unfortunately, this is only achieved in 1/3-1/2 of patients. The combination therapy associated with isosorbide-5-mononitrate and propranolol or nadolol administration enhances the fall in portal pressure and increases the number of patients in whom HVPG decreases more than 20% and below 12 mm Hg. Randomized trials (RCTs) support the fact that combination therapy is more effective than propranolol or nadolol alone and better than sclerotherapy. In the treatment of acute variceal bleeding, pharmalogical therapy offers the unique advantage of permitting the provision of specific therapy immediately after arrival to hospital, or even during transferral to hospital by ambulance, since it does not require sophisticated personnel. Terlipressin has proved to be effective and to decrease mortality from bleeding. RCTs have shown that this drug is as effective and safer than emergency sclerotherapy. Therapy should be maintained for five days to prevent early rebleeding. Somatostatin is probably as effective as terlipressin.", 
    "54": "Phosphatidic acid (PA), lysophosphatidic acid, ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P), and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are lipid mediators generated by phospholipases, sphingomyelinases, and lipid kinases. The major pathway for degradation of these lipids is dephosphorylation catalyzed by members of two classes (types 1 and 2) of phosphohydrolase activities (PAPs). cDNAs encoding two type 2 PAPs, PAP-2a and -2b, have been expressed by transient transfection and shown to catalyze hydrolysis of PA, C1P, and S1P (Kai, M., Wada, I., Imai, S., Sakane, F. and Kanoh, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 24572-24578). We report the cloning and expression of a third type 2 PAP enzyme (288 amino acids, predicted molecular mass of 32.6 kDa), PAP-2c, which exhibits 54 and 43% sequence homology to PAPs 2a and 2b. Expression of HA epitope-tagged PAP-2a, -2b, and 2c in HEK293 cells produced immunoreactive proteins and increased membrane-associated PAP activity. Sf9 insect cells contain very low endogenous PAP activity. Recombinant expression of the three PAP enzymes using baculovirus vectors produces dramatic increases in membrane-associated Mg2+-independent, N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive PAP activity. Expression of PAP-2a but not PAP-2b or -2c resulted in high levels of cell surface PAP activity in intact insect cells. Kinetic analysis of PAP-2a, -2b, and -2c activity against PA, lysophosphatidic acid, C1P, and S1P presented in mixed micelles of Triton X-100 revealed differences in substrate specificity and susceptibility to inhibition by sphingosine, Zn2+, and propranol.", 
    "55": "The effects of the aqueous extract of Pavetta crassipes leaves were studied on gastrointestinal and uterine smooth muscle preparations isolated from rabbit jejunum, guinea pig ileum and rat uterus. The extract produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the spontaneous motility or elevated tone in these preparations. The inhibitory effects of the extract were not affected by pretreatment with propranolol or yohimbine, but were completely blocked by verapamil pretreatment. The results indicate the presence of biologically active substances whose action might be mediated through calcium channels. A preliminary phytochemical screening of the leaf extract of P. crassipes revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins and anthraquinones as possible candidates for such inhibitory substances.", 
    "56": "Hypertensive crisis is defined as a severe elevation in BP and is classified as either urgency or emergency. In hypertensive urgency there is no end-organ injury and no evidence that acute BP lowering is beneficial. Indeed, rapid uncontrolled pressure reduction may be harmful. Therefore, in hypertensive urgencies BP should be lowered gradually over 24 to 48 hours using oral antihypertensives. When the cause of transient BP elevations is easily identified, appropriate treatment should be given. When the cause is unknown, an oral antihypertensive should be given. The efficacy of available treatments appear similar; however, the underlying pathophysiological and clinical findings, mechanism of action and potential for adverse effects should guide choice. Captopril should be avoided in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or unilateral renal artery stenosis in patients with a solitary kidney. Nifedipine and other dihydropyridines increase heart rate whereas clonidine, beta-blockers and labetalol tend to decrease it. This is particularly important in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Labetalol and beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with bronchospasm and bradycardia or heart blocks. Clonidine should be avoided if mental acuity is desired. In hypertensive emergency there is an immediate threat to the integrity of the cardiovascular system. BP should be immediately reduced to avoid further end organ damage. Sodium nitroprusside is the most popular agent. Nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) is preferred when there is acute coronary insufficiency. A beta-blocker may be added in some patients. Loop diuretics, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside are effective in patients with concomitant pulmonary oedema. Enalaprilat is also theoretically helpful, especially when the renin system might be activated. Initial treatment of aortic dissection involves rapid, controlled titration of arterial pressure to normal levels using intravenous sodium nitroprusside and a beta-blocker. If beta-blockers are contraindicated, urapidil or trimetaphan camsilate are alternatives. Hydralazine is the drug of choice for patients with eclampsia. Labetalol, urapidil or calcium antagonists are possible alternatives if hydralazine fails or is contraindicated. For patients with catecholamine-induced crises, an alpha-blocker such as phentolamine should be given; labetalol or sodium nitroprusside with beta-blockers are alternatives. There are few, if any, comparative or randomised trials providing definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety of comparative agents. Some investigators recommend decreasing the diastolic BP to no less than 100 to 110 mm Hg. A reasonable approach for most patients with hypertensive emergencies is to lower the mean arterial pressure by 25% over the initial 2 to 4 hours with the most specific antihypertensive regimen.", 
    "57": "We studied the existence of beta 3-adrenoceptors in canine pulmonary artery smooth muscle under isometric conditions in vitro. A rank order potency of vascular relaxation was isoproterenol > salbutamol > selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonists, CL 316243 and BRL 37344. A marked desensitization to salbutamol occurred by pretreatment with salbutamol but not with CL 316243. When beta 1-adrenoceptors were blocked, the relaxant responses to salbutamol were competitively antagonized by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551, whereas the response to CL 316243 was not. Cyanopindolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, antagonized CL 316243-induced relaxation in a competitive manner with a pA2 of 6.10, and this value was lower than that when salbutamol was used as an agonist (6.69). Intracellular cAMP levels were increased by CL 316243, an effect that was not altered by ICI 118551. Therefore, beta 3-adrenoceptors may be present and functioning in canine pulmonary artery.", 
    "58": "1. Inotropic and electrophysiologic effects of veratrine, vesnarinone, d-sotalol and tetraethylammonium (TEA) were compared. Action-potential duration (APD) and contractility were measured in isolated canine Purkinje fiber and ventricular trabecular muscle preparations by using standard microelectrode techniques. Each drug significantly increased APD and force development in either tissue. 2. Drug-induced increases in force development were normalized to increases in APD. The order of efficacy was found to be vesnarinone>veratrine>TEA in ventricular myocardium, whereas it was veratrine>vesnarinone=d-sotalol=TEA in Purkinje fibers. 3. The force-APD relation was linear for all drugs in the concentrations used. 4. Simultaneous measurements of APD, force development and intracellular sodium ion activity (a(i)Na) in the presence of either veratrine or lidocaine indicated a linear relation between force development and changes in a(i)Na. 5. The relation between APD and force development was different in ventricular and Purkinje fiber preparations. Differences in the veratrine sensitivity of the force-APD relation observed between Purkinje and ventricular preparations suggest that a(i)Na-dependent changes in Na+/Ca2+ exchange may play a more important role in regulation of force generation in Purkinje fibers than in ventricular myocardium.",

Unconsciousness was induced with methohexital 1 mg/kg i.v.; succinylcholine 1.2 to 1.5 mg/kg i.v. was administered for muscle relaxation.

    "64": "Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) values were recorded at 1- to 5-minute intervals throughout the study period. When administered as a rapid infusion, nicardipine 5 mg i.v. produced a significant decrease in MAP; however, nicardipine dosages of 10 to 15 mg i.v. did not produce a significantly greater decrease in MAP than 5 mg. Bolus administration of nicardipine 1.25 to 5 mg produced a rapid onset of its hemodynamic effects without exacerbating the cardiovascular depressant effects of methohexital. However, the decrease in MAP was accompanied by an increase in HR after administration of the 5 mg i.v. bolus dose. The acute hyperdynamic response to ECT was most effectively controlled by nicardipine 2.5 to 5 mg i.v. bolus, in combination with labetalol 10 mg i.v.

    "66": "This study tested the hypothesis that the beta-adrenergic antagonists betaxolol and timolol, cause retinal arteriolar vasodilatation in addition to their ability to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), and compared their vasodilatory ability with that of a known Ca2+ channel entry blocker nimodipine in donor human and pig isolated perfused retinal arterioles. This study was performed using a microperfusion technique specifically established to allow investigations in arterioles as small as the first order human and pig retinal arterioles (approximately 100 microns diameter). The scarcity of viable human tissue was overcome by the successful development of controlled rate freezing and cryopreservation techniques which were able to preserve the vascular responsiveness of the retinal arterioles, thus enabling multiple experiments to be performed on segments of retinal arterioles from each individual donor eye. Furthermore, relaxation by acetylcholine in noradrenaline contracted pig retinal arterioles showed that endothelial cell function was well maintained after cryopreservation (n = 8). Baseline diameters of retinal arterioles used in the main studies were: cryopreserved human 92.3 +/- 3.4 microns (n = 44), fresh pig 94.7 +/- 2.2 microns (n = 42), and cryopreserved pig 94.3 +/- 2.3 microns (n = 30). Precontraction with extraluminal endothelin-1 (ET-1) 10(-9) M reduced the diameters to 74.3 +/- 0.9%, 71.6 +/- 1.6% and 72.5 +/- 0.9% respectively. Intraluminally applied nimodipine and betaxolol caused a significant dose dependent dilatation (P < 0.001) in human retinal arterioles with a threshold of 10(-12) M. Timolol did not produce a significant dilatation in human arterioles. Timolol produced a small but significant dilatation in fresh and cryopreserved pig arterioles but the dilatation with betaxolol and nimodipine was significantly larger. The nimodipine and betaxolol dose response curves were not significantly different in human arterioles, but nimodipine produced significantly greater dilatation than betaxolol (P < 0.001) in fresh and cryopreserved pig arterioles. Both nimodipine and betaxolol were significantly more effective vasodilators than timolol (P < 0.001) in human and pig retinal arterioles.", 
    "67": "Electrophysiologic properties of surviving Purkinje cardiomyocytes in the late postmyocardial-infarction phase are not well established. By using standard microelectrode techniques, we evaluated the effects of the class III agent d-sotalol on action potential parameters of single Purkinje cardiomyocytes isolated from normal canine hearts or those 10-14 days after infarction. Measurements were obtained at 2.5, 3.5, and 6 mM extracellular potassium concentrations. Action-potential parameters recorded at baseline did not differ significantly between normal and infarct-surviving Purkinje cardiomyocytes. At 3.5 and 6 mM extracellular potassium concentrations, surviving Purkinje cells appeared to be more sensitive to the effects of d-sotalol than normal Purkinje cells. In contrast, at 2.5 mM extracellular potassium concentration, the differential responses of normal and infarct-surviving Purkinje cells to d-sotalol was abolished. Reverse rate dependence was more prominent in normal than in postinfarction Purkinje cells, independent of the extracellular potassium concentration studied. The previously described enhanced sensitivity of subacutely infarcted tissue to class III agents seems to persist on a cellular level 10-14 days after myocardial infarction, even after full normalization of baseline action-potential parameters. Differential membrane-regulation mechanisms, dependent on the extracellular potassium concentrations, may account for the increased susceptibility to antiarrhythmia agents in the late postinfarction phase.", 
    "68": "Bilayered osmotically controlled Gastrointestinal Therapeutic System of atenolol has been obtained by using cellulose acetate pseudolatex prepared by polymer emulsification method. Various factors such as orifice size, coating thickness, amount and nature of polymeric excipients, and amount of osmotic agent influence the drug release from GITS. Therefore, in the present study a 7-factor, 12-run Plackett-Burman screening design was employed to evaluate the formulation variables for atenolol GITS coated with CA pseudolatex. The variables studied were orifice size, %coating weight gain, amounts of sodium chloride. Polyox N80 and 303, and Carbopol 934P and 974P on drug release. The screening design has revealed that orifice size, %coating weight gain and amount of Carbopol 934P have prominent influence on in-vitro atenolol release. The response variable was cumulative percent atenolol released (Y) in 24 h with constraints on percent release at 2, 6, 12 and 18 h. The polynomial equation obtained was Y24 = 149.82 - 0.13 X1 - 0.34X2 + 0.06X3 - 0.13X4 - 0.23X5 - 76.25X6 - 2.46X7.

    "69": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible advantages of floating and high-density dosage forms and their influence on pharmacokinetic parameters. Atenolol was chosen as a model drug because of its poor absorption in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Three formulations containing 25 mg atenolol, a floating multiple-unit capsule, a high-density multiple-unit capsule, and an immediate-release tablet were compared with respect to estimated pharmacokinetic parameters. The two multiple-unit dosage forms were composed of compressed minitablets and had sustained release properties. The bioavailability of the two gastroretentive preparations with sustained release characteristics was significantly decreased when compared to the immediate-release tablet. The floating minitablets seemed to be retained longer in the stomach than the high-density dosage form. The first atenolol concentration detectable in the plasma and the time to peak Tmax were delayed for the floating dosage form. For the parameters Cmax and AUC 0-infinity, the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval was outside the bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25). This study showed that it was not possible to increase the bioavailability of a poorly absorbed drug such as atenolol using gastroretentive formulations. Atenolol absorption was delayed and the maximum plasma concentration was diminished.", 
    "70": "The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in cerebral hemodynamics in young patients with uncomplicated hypertension before and after effective antihypertensive treatment with a beta-blocker drug. Changes in mean flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery from normal condition to hypercapnia were evaluated by means of a transcranial Doppler in 42 hypertensive patients and 21 healthy subjects comparable for age and sex distribution. We obtained hypercapnia with breath-holding and evaluated cerebrovascular reactivity with the breath-holding index (BHI). After a baseline evaluation (time 0), patients were randomly assigned to a placebo (group 1) or atenolol (group 2) therapy. The evaluation was repeated after 30 (time 1) and 60 (time 2) days of treatment. Before treatment, hypertensive patients had significantly lower BHI values (0.96 +/- 0.1 group 1 and 0.85 +/- 0.3 group 2) than controls (1.69 +/- 0.4) (P < 0.0001). During treatment, mean blood pressure significantly decreased in group 2 patients. In the same group, BHI values significantly increased with respect to the pre-treatment evaluation: 1.39 +/- 0.2 at time 1 and 1.44 +/- 0.2 at time 2 (P < 0.0001). On the contrary, mean blood pressure and BHI values remained unchanged in the placebo group. Furthermore, BHI values were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 patients at times 1 (P < 0.001) and 2 (P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that hypertension causes reduced capability of cerebral vessels to adapt to functional changes. This condition, which is reversible after treatment, could be implicated in the increased susceptibility to ischemic stroke in hypertension.", 
    "71": "It has been shown that short-term (hours) treatment with beta-adrenergic agonists can stimulate lung liquid clearance via augmented Na+ transport across alveolar epithelial cells. This increase in Na+ transport with short-term beta-agonist treatment has been explained by activation of the Na+ channel or Na+-K+-ATPase by cAMP. However, because the effect of sustained stimulation (days) with beta-adrenergic agonists on the Na+ transport mechanism is unknown, we examined this question in cultured rat alveolar type II cells. Na+-K+-ATPase activity was increased in these cells by 10(-4) M terbutaline in an exposure time-dependent manner over 7 days in culture. This increased activity was also associated with an elevation in transepithelial current that was inhibited by amiloride. The enzyme's activity was also augmented by continuous treatment with dibutyryl-cAMP (DBcAMP) for 5 days. This increase in Na+-K+-ATPase activity by 10(-4) M terbutaline was associated with an increased expression of alpha1-Na+-K+-ATPase mRNA and protein. beta-Adrenergic agonist treatment also enhanced the expression of the alpha-subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). These increases in gene expression were inhibited by propranolol. Amiloride also suppressed this long-term effect of terbutaline and DBcAMP on Na+-K+-ATPase activity. In conclusion, beta-adrenergic agonists enhance the gene expression of Na+-K+-ATPase, which results in an increased quantity and activity of the enzyme. This heightened expression is also associated with augmented ENaC expression. Although the cAMP system is involved, the inhibition of enhanced enzyme activity with amiloride suggests that increased Na+ entry at the apical surface plays a role in this process.", 
    "72": "We examined the effects of acute exposure to ozone on the permeability of the tracheal mucosa and the contribution of neural pathways to the effects of ozone using horseradish peroxidase (HRP; mol wt 40,000) as a marker of lumen-to-blood transfer of a macromolecule in guinea pigs in vivo. Each guinea pig was anesthetized and exposed for 30 min to either ozone [0.5 or 3 parts/million (ppm)] or air. Immediately after exposure, a tracheal segment was isolated between two polyethylene cannulas in vivo and filled with HRP solution (50 mg/ml). Blood samples were drawn before and 10, 20, 30, and 40 min after the intratracheal instillation of HRP. The plasma levels of HRP in guinea pigs exposed for 30 min to 3 ppm of ozone, but not to 0.5 ppm of ozone, were significantly greater than those in guinea pigs exposed to air. Although the increased plasma HRP levels after exposure to 3 ppm of ozone were unaffected by propranolol or atropine, they were completely inhibited by pretreatment with capsaicin (50 mg/kg sc, injected in two doses). These results suggest that endogenous neuropeptides mediate the ozone-induced increase in the permeability of the tracheal mucosa in guinea pigs in vivo, but neither an adrenergic nor a cholinergic pathway appears to be involved.", 
    "73": "An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture. After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.",

In the present study we assessed the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sublingual propranolol. Fourteen severely hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > or = 115 mmHg), aged 40 to 66 years, were randomly chosen to receive a single dose of 40 mg propranolol hydrochloride by sublingual or peroral administration. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures, heart rate (HR) for pharmacodynamics and blood samples for noncompartmental pharmacokinetics were obtained at baseline and at 10, 20, 30, 60 and 120 min after the single dose. Significant reductions in BP and HR were obtained, but differences in these parameters were not observed when sublingual and peroral administrations were compared as follows: SBP (17 vs 18%, P = NS), DBP (14 vs 8%, P = NS) and HR (22 vs 28%, P = NS), respectively. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after sublingual or peroral drug administration were: peak plasma concentration (CMAX): 147 +/- 72 vs 41 +/- 12 ng/ml, P < 0.05; time to reach CMAX (TMAX): 34 +/- 18 vs 52 +/- 11 min, P < 0.05; biological half-life (t1/2b): 0.91 +/- 0.54 vs 2.41 +/- 1.16 h, P < 0.05; area under the curve (AUCT): 245 +/- 134 vs 79 +/- 54 ng h-1 ml-1, P < 0.05; total body clearance (CLT/F): 44 +/- 23 vs 26 +/- 12 ml min-1 kg-1, P = NS. Systemic availability measured by the AUCT ratio indicates that extension of bioavailability was increased 3 times by the sublingual route. Mouth paresthesia was the main adverse effect observed after sublingual administration. Sublingual propranolol administration showed a better pharmacokinetic profile and this route of administration may be an alternative for intravenous or oral administration.",

Plasma ANP levels were significantly higher in the propranolol group than in the control group. Both receptor densities and mRNA levels of ANP(C) receptor were significantly decreased in the lung as the major site of ANP clearance from the circulation. In contrast, both central venous pressure and ANP mRNA levels in the heart were not significantly different between the two groups. Under both basal and ANP-stimulated conditions, the cGMP content in the aorta was significantly greater in the propranolol group than in the control group, whereas the basal and stimulated cGMP content of the kidney was similar in the two groups. Inhibition of endogenous ANP action by a specific ANP receptor antagonist, HS-142-1, produced a greater increase of blood pressure in the propranolol group than in the control group. These results suggest potentiation of natriuretic peptide activity as a new antihypertensive mechanism of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol.",

Patients who expressed a preference preferred dorzolamide over pilocarpine by a ratio of more than 10:1. Patients reported less interference with their daily life because of side effects and activity limitations while receiving dorzolamide than while receiving pilocarpine. Dorzolamide and pilocarpine were comparably effective in lowering IOP (16% to 17%). Also, significantly more patients reported adverse experiences and discontinued therapy as a result of adverse experiences while receiving pilocarpine than while receiving dorzolamide.",

AC activity in response to a submaximal isoproterenol concentration was potently inhibited by the beta2-AR-selective antagonist ICI118551, whereas the beta1-AR-selective antagonist CGP20712A was effective only in very high concentrations. (-)-[125I]-cyanopindolol ([125I]-CYP) saturation binding experiments indicated a single affinity component (dissociation constant (Kd) = 22 +/- 2 pM) for beta-AR sites (maximal beta -AR density (Bmax) = 14 +/- 2 fmol/ mg). Eadie-Hofstee analysis of [125I]-CYP displacement curves by beta1-, beta2- or beta3-AR-selective ligands allowed to characterise a homogeneous population of beta2-AR sites. Finally, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of beta-AR subtype mRNAs identified beta2-AR transcripts but no beta1- and beta3-AR mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that beta2-AR is the only beta-AR subtype expressed in the diaphragm.",

Previous works from our laboratory reproducing experimental Chagas' disease in mice, demonstrated that the affinity and density of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors were altered during the acute, indeterminate and chronic phase in Albino Swiss mice inoculated with Trypanosoma cruzi. Keeping in mind that Propranolol is a beta-blocking agent that binds in the same receptors' site, which we have described as altered along T. cruzi infection. The present study was performed to determine if a beta-blocker treatment could prevent cardiac beta-receptors' disorders provoked by T. cruzi infection. Two different doses of Propranolol (9 and 40 mg/kg/day) were injected in the mice during 3 days; then they were infected with 7 x 10(4) parasites/mouse and propranolol was continued daily for one week. The results showed that the concentrations of propranolol used did not protect the beta-receptors' sites by administration of each doses.", 
    "97": "Low doses of naturally occurring prostaglandins reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP) in many species. Species differences do occur both in terms of efficiency and mechanism of action, and also among the different prostaglandins. Among the prostaglandins mainly PGF2 alpha has been tested in human eyes. Although it is an effective ocular hypotensive drug it is not clinically useful due to pronounced ocular side-effects, mainly conjunctival hyperemia and irritation, at doses that produce a maximal effect on IOP. Modification of the drug has resulted in two analogues that are now in clinical use, latanoprost and unoprostone. In long-term studies latanoprost, when applied as a once-daily dose of a 0.005% concentration, reduces IOP at least as effectively as adrenergic beta-receptor blockers. The reduction of IOP is due to increased outflow. This takes place mainly, or exclusively, through the uveoscleral routes, thus introducing a new pharmacological principle for the treatment of glaucoma. The drug reaches systemic concentrations that are below the level expected to stimulate FP-receptors outside the eye and it is rapidly eliminated with a half-life in plasma of 17 minutes, which explains why the clinical trials have not revealed any systemic side-effects with latanoprost. The most frequent side-effect observed with latanoprost is an increased pigmentation of the iris mainly in eyes with irides that are already partly brown. This effect is seen with several naturally occurring prostaglandins and is due to stimulation of melanin production in the melanocytes of the iridial stroma. No structural changes of the melanocytes have been observed in studies performed both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism of action for unoprostone is the same as for latanoprost. No effect on iris colour has been reported for unoprostone but so far there is limited experience with the drug in eyes with a mixed iris colour.",

This prompted us to investigate the glucose uptake in response to an alpha-1 adrenergic stimulation. We measured the adrenergic regulation of glucose uptake by adipocytes isolated from epididymal white adipose tissue using agonists (norepinephrine, phenylephrine and isoproterenol) and antagonists (prazosin and propranolol) of alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptor subtypes. Our results show that the maximal glucose uptake obtained in the presence of 10(-8) M norepinephrine is partially inhibited by prazosin (10(-6) M, 57%) or propranolol (10(-6) M, 52%) suggesting that glucose uptake is subjected to both alpha-1 and beta regulation. Indeed, our findings show that glucose uptake is dose-dependently increased by phenylephrine. This stimulation is totally inhibited by prazosin (10(-6) M). Isoproterenol stimulated glucose uptake. The stimulation of glucose uptake by isoproterenol is totally inhibited in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M) in the incubation medium. Our results demonstrate for the first time that alpha-1 adrenergic subtype is involved in the regulation of glucose uptake by white adipocytes.", 
    "103": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the ultrastructure of the local nerve supply of ovine gallbladders as well as the functional characteristics of inhibitory nerves. We used electron microscopy of thin sections of ovine gallbladders and in vitro isometric tension recording using gallbladder strips. Specifically, we measured contractile and inhibitory responses induced by transmural electrical field stimulation (EFS). We found a ganglionated plexus with intramural nerve cells and interconnecting axons. Clear and large dense-core vesicles colocalized in axons close to smooth muscle cells. EFS elicited gallbladder contractions which were converted to relaxation after atropine. EFS-induced relaxation was reduced by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, L-NOARG and blocked by propranolol and/or tetrodotoxin. In conclusion, enteric ganglia and neurones with synaptic vesicles (clear and dense core) were detected close to smooth muscle bundles. Neural inhibition of gallbladder contraction was mediated by beta-adrenoceptors coupled to NO generation.", 
    "104": "The present study was undertaken to investigate thoroughly the preclinical psychopharmacological profile of venlafaxine, testing a wide range of doses in animal models indicative of antidepressant-like effects. Venlafaxine was found to be active in mouse forced swimming test (at 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg/kg) and to increase spontaneous locomotor activity (at 16, 32 and 64 mg/kg). Venlafaxine antagonised apomorphine-induced (16 mg/kg) hypothermia (at 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg/kg). Pretreatment with PCPA significantly attenuated the anti-immobility effects of venlafaxine (8 and 16mg/kg; P< 0.01) in the mouse forced swimming test. Venlafaxine at a dose of 32 mg/kg remained active, despite PCPA pretreatment. DSP-4 significantly attenuated the anti-immobility effects of venlafaxine (16 mg/kg; P < 0.05), whereas venlafaxine at 32 mg/kg remained active, despite DSP-4 pretreatment. Venlafaxine was active in the forced swimming test when administered at sub-effective doses in combination with (+/-) pindolol (venlafaxine: 1 and 2 mg/kg), RU 24969 (venlafaxine: 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (venlafaxine: 4 mg/kg), clonidine (venlafaxine: 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg), lithium (venlafaxine: 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) and quinine (venlafaxine: 1 and 2 mg/kg). Prior administration with NAN-190 antagonised the anti-immobility effects of venlafaxine (8, 16 and 32 mg/kg). Interaction studies did not induce changes in locomotor activity. The results of the present study indicated that, at low doses, venlafaxine inhibited serotonin reuptake, while at higher doses it inhibited both serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake.", 
    "105": "The hypothesis that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate initiation of lasting behavioral changes induced by the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, was supported in this study. Behavioral changes normally induced by FG-7142 were blocked when the competitive NMDA receptor blocker, 7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid, was given prior to administration of FG-7142. When cats were subsequently given FG-7142 alone, the drug produced lasting behavioral changes like those reported previously. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reversed an increase in defensiveness produced by FG-7142 alone, replicating previous findings. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation in limbic pathways subserving defensive response to threat mediates lasting increases in defensiveness produced by FG-7142.", 
    "106": "The anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142, produces intense anxiety in humans and anxiety-like behavior in animals. FG-7142 also mimics the effects of exogenous stressors. In cats, FG-7142 lastingly changes defensive and aggressive behavior. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of neural transmission between limbic structures known to modulate feline defensive response to threat accompany behavioral changes. A series of three reports describes experiments designed to test the hypothesis that behavioral changes depend upon an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-based LTP of efferent transmission from the amygdala. This first study characterizes the dose and time effects of injection of the NMDA receptor blocker 7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7) on efferent transmission from the cat amygdala to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Effects of doses of 0.5-10mg/kg (i.v.) of AP7 on potentials evoked in the VMH by single pulse stimulation of the basal amygdala were examined. In order to localize the action of the drug, concurrent measurements were taken of potentials evoked in the VMH by stimulation of the efferent fibers from the amygdala to the VMH (ventral amygdalofugal pathway, VAF). There was a dose-dependent reduction in the amygdalo-VMH evoked potential. The greatest reduction occurred at 5 mg/kg. Effects peaked at 10 min, and persisted for at least 1 h after injection. In contrast, AP7 increased the VAF-VMH-evoked potential at 10 min after injection, with a maximal increase at 5mg/kg. The data suggest that NMDA receptors intrinsic to the amygdala modulate excitatory efferent transmission from amygdala to VMH in the cat. It is speculated that a glutamatergic projection to gamma-aminobutyric acid tonic inhibitory systems in the VMH accounts for the VAF-VMH results.", 
    "107": "It is demonstrated that the apparent permeability (P(app)) coefficients of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist drugs can easily be determined for Caco-2 cell culture intestinal models utilizing liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The LC/MS method with electrospray ionization in the single ion monitoring mode showed an increased sensitivity of 1000-fold compared with LC/UV detection and enhanced selectivity with respect to both LC/UV and radioactivity assays. The P(app) coefficients of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists determined by LC/MS have the same ranking order as those determined by LC/UV and radioactivity assays. However, the P(app) coefficients determined in this study showed significant discrepancies from those determined in other laboratories. There are several experimental factors that directly affect the absolute value of the P(app) coefficients, including pH gradients, additional diffusion barriers (i.e. unstirred water layer and type of filter support), analyte concentration, detection method and possibly cell culture variations. These parameters should be controlled when generating Caco-2 P(app) coefficients for different compounds.", 
    "108": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to map alterations in binding to alpha1-, alpha2-, beta1- and beta2-adrenergic receptors throughout the brain of rats deprived of rapid eye movement sleep for 96 h. Binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha1 sites, while not significantly different in any of 46 brain regions examined, showed a clear overall tendency towards decreased values after sleep deprivation. [3H]UK-14,314-labeled alpha2 binding sites were not significantly affected by sleep deprivation in any of 91 brain regions analysed, despite a trend towards increased values. In contrast, beta-adrenergic binding was significantly reduced throughout the brain. Binding to beta1 sites labeled by [125I]iodopindolol in the presence of ICI-11855 was significantly reduced in 13 of 69 brain areas examined; binding to beta2 sites labeled by [125I]iodopindolol in the presence of CGP-20712A was likewise reduced throughout the brain and significantly so in 25 of the 72 brain areas analysed. Rank ordering of the binding changes indicated that reductions in beta1 vs beta2 binding were maximal in different brain areas. This pattern of results may reflect a particular configuration of effects specifically associated with sleep loss stress. The results are consistent with evidence of persisting noradrenergic cell activity during sleep deprivation. The observed heterogeneity of effects suggests that not all norepinephrine receptors are equally affected by rapid eye movement sleep deprivation.",

We have attempted to clarify the importance of the NANC system in the circadian variation in airway calibre in mild asthmatics and nocturnal asthmatics. NANC function in the human airway was studied at 0400 and 1600 hours in 12 nocturnal asthmatics and 12 mild asthmatics by measuring oscillatory resistance (Ros) following capsaicin inhalation. Measurements were made after combined beta- and atropinic blockade in the mild asthmatics but after atropinic blockade alone in the nocturnal asthmatics, in whom beta-blockade is contraindicated. To determine whether beta-blockade influences NANC bronchodilatation, we also studied 12 normal subjects with and without beta-blockade at 1600 hours only. The mild asthmatics showed differing (P = 0.007) resistance changes 1-3 min after capsaicin at 1600 hours (fall in Ros + 1%, CI -2% to 3%) from that at 0400 hours (-4%, CI -8% to -1%) but the nocturnal asthmatics showed no significant difference in response to capsaicin at the two times (fall in Ros: 1600 hours -9%, CI -15% to -3%; 0400 hours -3%, -7% to 1%). The normal subjects showed greater (P = 0.0001) bronchodilatation 1-3 min after capsaicin following atropine plus propranolol (-7%, -11% to -3%) than after atropine alone (-2%, -6% to 2%), supporting interaction between the beta-sympathetic and NANC systems in the human airway, NANC bronchodilatation being inhibited by beta-sympathetic activity.

    "122": "Glaucoma describes a group of ocular conditions which involve progressive optic nerve damage associated with loss of visual function and, frequently, with elevated intraocular pressure. Recent estimates of worldwide prevalence predict that 67 million people will suffer from glaucoma by the year 2000. Although the clinical features of glaucoma are reasonably well described, the pathogenesis of optic nerve damage remains unclear. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is accepted as an important risk factor; however, it is clear that other factors play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, and such factors may interact with IOP to greatly enhance its harmful effects. Many of the new therapeutic approaches to the stabilisation and potential cure of glaucoma attempt to address these non-IOP factors.

Concanavalin A, an inhibitor of ecto-5'-nucleotidase, did not affect the presynaptic action of exogenously applied ATP. 4. The presynaptic action of adenosine was prevented by theophylline (1 mM), a blocker of adenosine receptors, while the effect of ATP was not changed under these conditions. The selective blocker of A1 adenosine receptors, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3,dipropylxanthine (DPCPX; 0.1 microM), abolished the presynaptic action of adenosine but did not prevent the depressant effect of ATP. 5. The effects of ATP and adenosine (at nearly saturating concentration) were additive suggesting that these purines activated not only distinct receptors but also different intracellular signalling mechanisms. 6. In contrast to the hypothesis that at the neuromuscular junction ATP reduces transmitter release via enzymatic degradation to presynaptically active adenosine, our data suggest that ATP (through its own presynaptic receptors) directly inhibits ACh release. Thus, ATP and adenosine might be almost equipotent as endogenous prejunctional neuromodulators at the neuromuscular junction.", 
    "135": "1. Levels of beta3-adrenoceptor (AR) mRNA were compared using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) in white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT), ileum and colon from genetically obese (ob/ob) and lean (+/+) C57BL/6J mice. Functional responses to the beta3-AR agonist CL 316243 were also characterized in ileal longitudinal smooth muscle from obese and lean mice. 2. Beta3-AR mRNA levels were significantly higher in WAT (100+/-16%) and BAT (100+/-13%) from lean compared to WAT (21.0+/-0.9%; n=4; P<0.005) and BAT (14.1+/-2.2%; n=5; P<0.01) from obese mice. In contrast, beta3-mRNA levels were not significantly different in ileum (100+/-15%) and colon (100+/-22%) from lean mice, compared to ileum (78+/-13%; n=4; P= 0.31) or colon (82+/-15%; n =4; P=0.52) from obese mice. 3. Concentration-response curves to CL 316243 did not differ significantly in slope or position in ileal longitudinal smooth muscle from obese or lean mice. pEC50 (+/-s.e.mean) values were not significantly different (P= 0.59) between obese (7.90+/-0.13, n = 7) and lean (7.77+/-0.20, n = 7) mice. 4. pKB values for the beta1-AR and beta2-AR selective antagonist propranolol or the beta3-AR selective antagonist SR 58894 against relaxations to CL 316243 were similar in ileum of genetically obese (propranolol 6.31+/-0.22 and 6.13+/-0.12; SR 58894 8.22+/-0.06) and lean mice (propranolol 6.40+/-0.08 and 6.60+/-0.13; SR 58894 8.27+/-0.12) and were consistent with values previously found at beta3-AR. 5. Treatment of lean C57BL/6J mice with dexamethasone (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.) significantly reduced beta3-AR mRNA levels after 4 h in WAT (100+/-6.1 to 41.4+/-4.3; n= 16 18; P<0.0001) and BAT (100+/-8.0 to 35.1+/-5.8; n= 17; P<0.0001), but caused no change in ileum (100+/-6.1 to 101+/-17; n= 10-11; P=0.95) or colon (100+/-11 to 101+/-11; n= 11; P= 0.94). Beta3-mRNA levels in ileum and colon also did not change significantly when examined over 24 h or after the administration of a higher dose of dexamethasone (5 mg kg(-1)). 6. In summary, beta3-AR mRNA levels were considerably lower in WAT and BAT of obese compared to lean mice whereas the levels in ileum and colon were not significantly different. The similar beta3-mRNA levels in ileum of obese and lean mice were associated with indistinguishable responses of carbachol-contracted ileum to a beta3-agonist and similar affinity for beta-antagonists. Administration of glucocorticoids to lean mice reduced beta3-AR mRNA levels in WAT and BAT but not in ileum or colon. These studies show that in mice, beta3-ARs are differentially regulated in ileum and colon compared to adipose tissues.", 
    "136": "1. The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline and salbutamol on IgE-mediated histamine release from human lung mast cells (HLMC) were evaluated. Both agonists (10(-10)-10(-5) M) inhibited histamine release in a dose-dependent manner and isoprenaline (pD2, 8.3+/-0.1, mean+/-s.e.mean) was more potent than salbutamol (7.3+/-0.1). Moreover, the mean data indicated that salbutamol was a partial agonist when compared with isoprenaline. However, there was a large degree of interexperimental variability because, in 11 of 32 experiments, salbutamol was a full agonist and, in 21 of 32 experiments, a partial agonist relative to isoprenaline. These data suggest that different HLMC preparations possess variable receptor reserves. 2. The effect of the irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, bromoacetylalprenolol menthane (BAAM), on the inhibition of IgE-mediated histamine release by both isoprenaline and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was assessed. Whereas BAAM (100 nM) antagonized the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release from activated HLMC, BAAM had no effect on the PGE2 inhibition. Pretreatment of HLMC with the beta2-selective competitive antagonist, ICI 118551 (100 nM), protected against the loss in responsiveness to isoprenaline following treatment with BAAM. 3. Concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 nM of BAAM caused dose-dependent rightward shifts in the dose-response curve for the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release. Furthermore, there was a dose-dependent reduction in the maximal inhibitory response obtained with isoprenaline following treatments with increasing concentrations of BAAM. Although the rightward shifts in the isoprenaline dose-response curves, with a given concentration of BAAM, were similar in all experiments, there was some variability in the depression of the maximal response in individual experiments. Thus, in 6 of 16 experiments, BAAM (1 nM) did not depress the maximal response to isoprenaline, whereas in 10 of 16 experiments there was a depression (7 to 49% reduction) in the maximal response. These data suggest that different HLMC preparations possess variable receptor reserves. 4. Isoprenaline was more potent as an inhibitor in those HLMC preparations in which there was a larger receptor reserve (i.e. preparations in which the maximal inhibitory response to isoprenaline was unaffected by pretreatment with 1 nM BAAM). 5. The influence of receptor reserve on the inhibition by salbutamol of histamine release from HLMC was evaluated. There was a good correlation (r=0.77) between receptor reserve and the maximal response (relative to isoprenaline) obtained with salbutamol. Thus, HLMC preparations with larger receptor reserves were more responsive to salbutamol. 6. Receptor reserve influenced the desensitization of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses in HLMC. Cells were incubated (24 h) with isoprenaline (1 microM), washed and then the ability of a second isoprenaline (10(-10)-10(-5) M) exposure to inhibit histamine release was assessed. The pretreatment caused a reduction in the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release although the extent of desensitization was highly variable, ranging from essentially negligible levels in some preparations to substantial reductions (93% desensitization) in the ability of isoprenaline to inhibit histamine release. There was a reasonable correlation (r=0.59) between receptor reserve and desensitization. Preparations that possessed a larger receptor reserve were more resistant to desensitization. 7. Collectively, these data suggest that a receptor reserve exists for the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of histamine release from HLMC but that the size of this reserve varies between HLMC preparations. Moreover, the size of this receptor reserve may influence the sensitivity of HLMC to beta-adrenoceptor agonists and the susceptibility of individual HLMC preparations to desensitization.", 
    "137": "The metabolic affects of anapriline, captopril, and clophelin were studied in the blood and liver homogenates ex vivo and in vitro in experiments on intact rats and rats with alloxan diabetes. Anapriline lowered the blood lactate content in rats with diabetes and intact rats, reduced the level of glycemia in animals with marked hyperglycemia. Captopril increased the blood insulin and lactate content in rats with diabetes and the content of pyruvate in vivo. The results of the study show that the use of clophelin and anaprilin in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus is most rational.", 
    "138": "Hypertension affects a large proportion of the adult population. Subsequently any change in treatment strategy may have a drastic impact on health expenditure especially when one decides to decrease the limits of arterial pressure beyond which a treatment is started. Results of pharmaco-economic studies are often controversial because they are mainly based on an evaluation of short-term absolute risks, maybe underestimating the benefit of a treatment in younger population with mild to moderate hypertension. All groups of antihypertensive drugs are able to reduce the blood pressure and most of them can induce a light improvement of patient quality of life. Diuretics and beta-blockers have a lower cost/effectiveness ratio. ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists may be preferred when other drugs are badly tolerated or when some other morbidities affect the patient.", 
    "139": "The expression of T-type Ca2+ current (ICa,T) has been reported to change during postnatal heart development and myocardial hypertrophy, which are characterized respectively by the arrest of the cell cycle soon after birth and a switching on of DNA synthesis in the terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes. The hypothesis that there are cell cycle-related changes in cardiac Ca2+ channel expression was tested by performing whole-cell voltage-clamp recording and BromodeoxyUridine (BrdU) immunolabeling to determine the S phase of the cell cycle in the same single cultured newborn rat ventricular cells. Myocytes were isolated from 1-day-old Wistar rats and cultured for 15 days. ICa,T was detected in 27% of the 5-day cultured myocytes. The progressive loss of ICa,T during the period of 15-day incubation, which resembles the developmental changes in vivo, paralleled the decrease in the percentage of cells showing BrdU labeling. At day 5 of cell culture, the fraction of myocytes expressing ICa,T was significantly higher in the BrdU-labeled population (95%) as compared with the non-labeled cells (19%). In addition, a 72-h treatment with 20 microM nickel, an ICa,T blocker, revealed no effect on the percentage of BrdU-positive cells. L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) was constantly expressed throughout the 15-day cell culture. The frequency of ICa,L expression was identical between the BrdU-labeled and the non-labeled myocytes, although the latter cell population demonstrated a relatively greater current density. No differences in the inactivating kinetics of ICa,L and their reaction to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation were observed between the two groups. These findings provide convincing evidence for the cell cycle-related expression of cardiac Ca2+ channel. Cardiomyocytes at the S phase of the cell cycle predominantly express ICa,T, while the major properties of ICa,L' are unchanged during the cell cycle. Such a cell cycle-related channel expression may play a critical role in regulating the cardiac electrophysiological properties during heart development and myocardial remodeling.", 
    "140": "Recently, details of a noninvasive balloon manometry technique for endoscopic measurement of variceal pressure (VP) have been published. However, to date, only few data exist on its feasibility and virtually none on its relation to endoscopic or clinical variables of portal hypertension.", 
    "141": "We investigated a total of 64 patients with esophageal varices using a scaled transparent balloon and a calibrated pressure manometer. Averaged from both fivefold balloon insufflation (variceal collapse) or desufflation (variceal appearance), we took measurements of the VP (mmHg) using the two techniques. These measurements were correlated between two investigators as well as to both clinical and endoscopic signs of portal hypertension. Furthermore, pressures were assessed prospectively before and during propranolol application.", 
    "142": "Measurements were successful in > 95% of all sessions without side effects. The intraobserver variance was 11.0 +/- 13.1%. Measurements correlated significantly between two observers (r = 0.80, insufflation technique, p < 0.01/r = 0.81, desufflation technique, p < 0.01). Pressures correlated positively to variceal sizes (p < 0.05). The presence of fundic varices was strongly associated with higher pressures (p < 0.02). In patients without medical decompressive therapy we found a significant relationship between VP and the presence of red colour signs or previous bleeding episodes. Clinical parameters did not correlate with VP (p > 0.05). As assessed by this technique, 8/11 patients receiving propranolol showed a decrease in VP (18.6 +/- 19.5% after 1.5 months and 33.3 +/- 11.9% after 3 months).", 
    "143": "This noninvasive balloon technique is a safe and practical method for estimating VP in patients with portal hypertension. As found by invasive methods, patients with large varices and concomitant fundic varices have higher VP. A drop in intravariceal pressure after propranolol therapy appears to be assessable.", 
    "144": "In the rat cortical collecting duct (CCD), epinephrine inhibits vasopressin (AVP)-dependent water permeability and Na+ reabsorption. Although inhibition is reversed by the alpha2-adrenoceptor (AR) antagonist yohimbine, suggesting the epinephrine effect is primarily mediated by an alpha2-AR [C. T. Hawk, L. H. Kudo, A. J. Rouch, and J. A. Schafer. Am. J. Physiol. 265 (Renal Fluid Electrolyte Physiol. 34): F449-F460, 1993], there are also suggestions of an effect at an additional receptor, perhaps an alpha1-AR. For the present experiments, we used RT-PCR of total RNA extracted from 1 to 5 mm of microdissected CCDs from rat kidney to identify the alpha-AR isoforms expressed. Specific primers for the alpha2-ARs amplifying from the 6th transmembrane (TM) to the 3'-untranslated regions, revealed the presence of alpha2A and alpha2B. Western blot analysis also indicated the presence of alpha2B-AR at the protein level. Degenerate alpha1-AR primers that amplify from conserved regions of TM-1 to TM-5, as well as specific primers that amplify either the same region (alpha1B), the carboxy terminus (alpha1A), or within the third cytoplasmic loop (alpha1D), indicated the presence of all three alpha1-ARs. Measurement of transepithelial voltage in isolated perfused renal tubules indicated a small inhibitory effect mediated by alpha1-ARs. Although the functional effects of epinephrine on AVP-dependent transport processes appear to be mediated predominantly by an alpha2-AR, a small contribution to the overall alpha-AR effect may be due to simultaneous activation of an alpha1-AR.", 
    "145": "Renal sympathetic nerves play a central role in the regulation of tubular Na+ reabsorption. Norepinephrine (NE) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are colocalized in renal sympathetic nerve endings. The purpose of this study is to examine the integrated effects of these neurotransmitters on the regulation of Na+-K+-ATPase, the enzyme responsible for active Na+ reabsorption in renal tubular cells. Studies were performed on proximal tubular segments, which express adrenergic alpha- and beta-receptors, as well as NPY-Y2 receptors. It was found that alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists had opposing effects on Na+-K+-ATPase activity. beta-Adrenergic agonists induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the Na+-K+-ATPase activity, whereas alpha-adrenergic agonists stimulated the enzyme. NPY abolished beta-agonist-induced deactivation of Na+-K+-ATPase and enhanced alpha-agonist-induced activation of Na+-K+-ATPase. The beta-adrenergic agonist appeared to inhibit Na+-K+-ATPase activity via a cAMP pathway. NPY antagonized beta-agonist-induced accumulation of cAMP. In our preparation, NE alone had no net effect but stimulated the Na+-K+-ATPase activity in the presence of beta-adrenergic antagonists, as well as in the presence of NPY. The results indicate that, in renal tissue, NPY determines the net effect of its colocalized transmitter, NE, by its ability to attenuate the beta- and enhance the alpha-adrenergic effect.", 
    "146": "Frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) has been proposed as a semiquantitative method for assessing activities in the autonomic nervous system. We examined whether absolute powers, normalized powers, and the low frequency-to-high frequency ratio (LF/HF) derived from the HRV power spectrum could detect shifts in autonomic balance in a setting with low sympathetic nervous tone. Healthy subjects were examined for 3 h in the supine position during 1) control conditions (n = 12), 2) acute beta-blockade (n = 11), and 3) chronic beta-blockade (n = 10). Heart rate fell during the first 40 min of the control session (72 +/- 2 to 64 +/- 2 beats/min; P < 0. 005) and was even lower during acute and chronic beta-blockade (56 +/- 2 beats/min; P < 0.005). The powers of all spectral areas rose during the first 60 min in all three settings, more so with beta-blockade (P < 0.05). LF/HF was found to contain the same information as powers expressed in normalized units. LF/HF detected the shift in autonomic balance induced by beta-blockade but not the change induced by supine position. In conclusion, none of the investigated measures derived from power spectral analysis comprehensively and consistently described the changes in autonomic balance.", 
    "147": "cAREL is a cAMP-responsive endothelial cell line carrying a luciferase reporter gene introduced by stable transfection of a luciferase enhancer trap into rabbit aortic endothelial cells. Luciferase gene expression in cAREL was stimulated 233-fold by 8-BrcAMP. Treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol induced a 7.0-fold increase in luciferase expression, which was partially blocked by either beta1- or beta2-adrenoceptor antagonists and totally blocked by propranolol and by a combination of beta1- plus beta2-adrenoceptor antagonists. Receptor stimulation was mimicked by cholera toxin, forskolin, 8-BrcAMP, and isobutylmethylxanthine but not by 8BrcGMP, dexamethasone, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Stimulation by isoproterenol was completely blocked by H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor. cAREL was also stimulated by A-23187, and this effect was abrogated by EGTA and H-89. cAREL is the first cAMP-sensitive endothelial cell line described, and it can be useful as a positive control, as a model for cAMP regulation, as a background to genetic introduction of receptors, as an indicator of intracellular pathway activation, and as a tool to investigate cAMP effects on other signaling pathways.", 
    "148": "The present study was designed to clarify the role of beta2-adrenoceptors in modulating the level of TNF and IL-6 gene transcription and their respective mRNA accumulations. Astrocytes were transfected with the 5'-flanking region of the TNF and IL-6 genes linked to a luciferase coding sequence as a reporter. The addition of isoproterenol had an inhibitory effect on the TNF and IL-6 promoter activity induced by LPS. The inhibitory effect was blocked in the presence of a beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist but not in the presence of a beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist. TNF and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels in the astrocytes were depressed by beta2-adrenoceptor activation which corresponded to changes in TNF and IL-6 promoter activity. These studies demonstrated that isoproterenol, via beta2-adrenoceptors, suppressed LPS-induced TNF and IL-6 promoter activities, mRNA accumulations, and protein levels in the astrocytes. Beta2-adrenoceptor activation may be an important mechanism for regulating TNF and IL-6 expression in brain diseases.", 
    "149": "Scatter and spatial resolution effects degrade the accuracy of radioactivity concentration estimates obtained from positron emission tomography (PET) data. We present and evaluate a methodology for region quantification which accounts for these degradations. The method is based on analysis of sinogram data and does not require dynamic data sequences to be reconstructed. Moreover, estimates of region variance are also produced which may be used to define weights for model analyses that use weighted least squares minimization in order to obtain unbiased parameter estimates. We evaluate the method using both simulation and measured data and find that, with an appropriate model of scatter and spatial resolution effects, it is unbiased and capable of quantifying myocardial concentration with no more than a 5% error in accuracy for myocardium as thin as 10 mm.", 
    "150": "Using a telemetry system with implantable transmitters, we recorded heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature, and locomotor activity continuously in awake, freely moving mice deficient in the thyroid hormone receptor-alpha1 (TRalpha1). We have previously reported that the TRalpha1-deficient mice have a 20% lower mean heart rate and a 0.5 degrees C lower body temperature compared with wild-type control animals. In this study we found that when 3,5, 3'-triiodothyronine (T3) was given once a day, there was a parallel increase in heart rate (occurring 1 day later in the TRalpha1-deficient mice than in controls) and body temperature. Analysis of single-lead ECG revealed a prolonged QRS and Q-Tend time in the TRalpha1-deficient mice, which was shortened after T3 treatment. Monophasic action potential durations, measured in hearts from anesthetized mice at 90% of repolarization, were significantly prolonged in TRalpha1-deficient mice. Air-jet stress and a single injection of an anticholinergic agent induced a parallel increase, and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker induced a decrease in heart rate in both groups. There was no difference in beta-adrenergic receptor density. The results indicate that the TRalpha1-deficient mice have a specific defect in intrinsic heart rate regulation.", 
    "151": "In dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, hilar venous pressure (Phv) and secretion were measured from the submandibular gland receiving spontaneous blood flow or vascular perfusion at the normal resting flow rate. Parasympathetic nerve stimulation and ACh-induced secretion increased Phv and its pulse pressure; Phv also showed an obvious arterial (or perfusion pressure)-like waveform. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) exerted similar effects on Phv but produced negligible secretion. Sympathetic nerve stimulation, phenylephrine, and clonidine did not induce secretion and had no significant action on Phv, whereas isoproterenol provoked secretion and changed Phv as with parasympathetic stimulation. Background or superimposed sympathetic nerve stimulation reduced the parasympathetic nerve-induced responses; the sympathetic inhibition was abolished by phentolamine and yohimbine but not by prazosin and propranolol. The results suggest a direct relationship between Phv and secretion during parasympathetic salivation: the elevation in Phv was primarily independent of the concurrent blood flow response, mediated via muscarinic and peptidergic mechanisms, and related to an opening of arteriovenous anastomoses. Sympathetic inhibition of parasympathetic salivation may be related to prevention of an increased Phv exerted primarily via the alpha2-adrenergic mechanism.",

Capsinolol (1.0-30.0 microM) in a cumulating manner decreased the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax), the action potential amplitude and twitch tension in isolated guinea-pig atria and papillary muscle, rabbit papillary muscle, dog Purkinje fibers and human ventricle tissues. 2. In the isolated guinea-pig atrium, perfusing with capsinolol at 3 microM for 3 min temporarily increased the twitch force and decreased spontaneous cycle length; however, the results were reversed after longer exposure of the tissue. 3. Capsinolol prolonged the duration of action potential in the guinea-pig atrium and rabbit papillary muscles. The maximum diastolic potential was shifted to a less-negative level in dog Purkinje fibers and human ventricular muscles.",

The effects of noradrenaline and isoprenaline on the Ca2+i-insensitive, voltage-activated K+ current in smooth muscle cells from the circular muscle layer of the guinea pig proximal colon were investigated by using standard whole-cell patch-clamp techniques at room temperature (22-24 degrees C). 2. The Ca2+-activated K+ current was eliminated by bathing cells in tetraethylammonium (TEA;2-5 mM) and a Ca2+-entry blocker (Cd2+, 0.1 mM) or nifedipine, 2-10 microM) and by internally perfusing cells with 3 mM EGTA. 3. Two Ca2+i-insensitive, voltage-activated K+ currents were recorded at potentials positive to -50 mV: (a) a transient K+ current (IKto) that was blocked by 4-aminopyridine (5 mM) and (b) a delayed rectifier-type K+ current (IKdel) that was blocked by TEA (>10 mM). 4. Both noradrenaline (10-50 microM) and isoprenaline (5-50 microM) reduced the amplitudes of IKto and IKdel irreversibly after a slow onset (2-5 min). This reduction was mimicked by forskolin (50-100 microM) and by 8 bromo-c-AMP (500 microM). 5. The voltage of half-maximal availability (V0.5) of IKto (-74.6+/-2.3 mV) was unaffected by isoprenaline (10 microM) (-76.7+/-3.6 mV, n=4), but the background \"leak\" current (Ileak) was increased from -48+/-9 to -70+/-20 pA. 6.

In all 9 patients, ventricular tachyarrhythmia could not be induced after dl-sotalol treatment. Isoproterenol was administered as a loading dosage of 0.025 microgram/kg for 5 min with a maintenance dosage of 0.0025 microgram/kg/min. The VERP and the QRS duration were determined at paced cycle lengths of 600, 400 and 300 msec. DL-sotalol and dl-sotalol + isoproterenol had no effect on ventricular conduction at the three cycle lengths. The VERP was significantly prolonged after dl-sotalol treatment at paced cycle lengths of 600 (241 +/- 16 to 302 +/- 28 msec, p < 0.001), 400 (223 +/- 21 to 280 +/- 23 msec, p < 0.001) and 300 msec (202 +/- 16 to 256 +/- 24 msec, p < 0.005), but there was a parallel shift of the VERP, suggesting the absence of use-dependent effects on the VERP.

The shortening of the VERP was greater at longer basic cycle lengths (600 and 400 msec) than at the shorter paced cycle length (300 msec, p < .05), but the percentage increase of the VERP was similar at the three basic cycle lengths of 600 (16%), 400 (15%) and 300 (20%) msec, indicating the lack of reverse use-dependency. The absence of reverse use-dependency of dl-sotalol on the VERP, even after isoproterenol administration, may be beneficial in the therapy of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and may account in part for the high efficacy of this drug.", 
    "167": "In vivo microdialysis was used to investigate nicotinic receptor-mediated acetylcholine release in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum of freely moving rats. Intraperitoneal administration of (-)-nicotine increased the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and frontal cortex but not in the striatum. (-)-Nicotine exhibited a bell-shaped dose-response relationship, and showed attenuation of response at the highest dose (5.0 mg/kg i.p.) in both the hippocampus and frontal cortex. In the hippocampus, (-)-nicotine (1.0 mg/kg i.p.)-induced increase of acetylcholine release was blocked by pretreatment with the centrally acting nicotinic receptor channel blocker, mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg i.p.), but not by hexamethonium (5.0 mg/kg i.p.), suggesting that the effects of (-)-nicotine were mediated by the central nicotinic receptor. (S)-3-methyl-5-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)isoxazole (ABT-418, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p.), reported to be a selective agonist for alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subunits, also enhanced the release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus, while 3-(2,4-dimethoxybenzlidene)-anabaseine (GTS-21, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p.), which has high affinity for the alpha7 nicotinic receptor subunit, was without effect. The natural alkaloids isolated from plants, (-)-cytisine and (-)-lobeline, had little effect on acetylcholine release from the hippocampus. A competitive antagonist for alpha4beta2 subunits of the nicotinic receptor, dihydro-beta-erythroidine, and a partial agonist for the beta2 subunit-containing nicotinic receptor, (-)-cytisine, inhibited (-)-nicotine-induced increase of acetylcholine release from the hippocampus, whereas a selective antagonist for the alpha7 subunit, methyllycaconitine, and a partial agonist for the alpha3 subunit-containing nicotinic receptor, (-)-lobeline, did not. These results indicate that there are certain differences among brain regions in the response of nicotinic receptor-mediated acetylcholine release and that (-)-nicotine-induced acetylcholine release in the rat hippocampus may be attributed to activation of the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor subunits.", 
    "168": "We hypothesized that selective control of ventricular contractility might be mediated by postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the cranial medial ventricular (CMV) ganglion plexus located in a fat pad at the base of the aorta. Sinus rate, atrioventricular (AV) conduction (ventricular rate during atrial pacing), and left ventricular contractile force (LV dP/dt during right ventricular pacing) were measured in eight chloralose-anesthetized dogs both before and during bilateral cervical vagus stimulation (20-30 V, 0.5 ms pulses, 15-20 Hz). Seven of these dogs were tested under beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 0.8 mg kg(-1) i.v.). Control responses included sinus node bradycardia or arrest during spontaneous rhythm, high grade AV block or complete heart block, and a 30% decrease in contractility from 2118 +/- 186 to 1526 +/- 187 mm Hg s(-1) (P < 0.05). Next, the ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (0.3-1.0 ml of a 50 microg ml(-1) solution) was injected into the CMV fat pad. Then vagal stimulation was repeated, which now produced a relatively small 5% (N.S., P > 0.05) decrease in contractility but still elicited the same degree of sinus bradycardia and AV block (N = 8, P < 0.05). Five dogs were re-tested 3 h after trimethaphan fat pad injection, at which time blockade of vagally-induced negative inotropy was partially reversed, as vagal stimulation decreased LV dP/dt by 19%. The same dose of trimethaphan given either locally into other fat pads (PVFP or IVC-ILA) or systemically (i.v.) had no effect on vagally-induced negative inotropy. Thus, parasympathetic ganglia located in the CMV fat pad mediated a decrease in ventricular contractility during vagal stimulation. Blockade of the CMV fat pad had no effect on vagally-mediated slowing of sinus rate or AV conduction.", 
    "169": "Fifty-two patients (48 women, 4 men, ages varying between 13 and 71 years) that fulfilled the criteria by Silberstein et al. (1994) for chronic daily headache (CDH) were studied. The main clinical characteristics allowed three diagnostic types of CDH: transformed migraine (n = 39; 75%); chronic tension-type headache (n = 11; 21.1%); and new daily persistent headache (n = 2; 3.9%). Thirty-four patient used to take symptomatic medication in excess and were considered as having drug-induced headache. The treatment included increasing doses of amitriptyline alone or associated with propranolol besides the interruption of the symptomatic medication. This scheme was effective to lower the frequency of headache in most CDH patients and its beneficial effects had lasted even six months after the beginning of the follow-up. In the few patients in which the treatment was unsuccessful, the persistence of abusive use of symptomatic drugs was statistically significant.", 
    "170": "Thermosensitive polymer networks were synthesized from poly(ethylene glycol), hexamethylene diisocyanate and 1,2,6-hexanetriol in stoichiometric proportions. By varying the amount of 1,2,6-hexanetriol and the molar mass of the poly(ethylene glycol), a wide range of networks with different crosslinking densities was prepared. The networks obtained were characterized by the temperature dependence of their degree of equilibrium swelling in water and by their Young's moduli. For each network, the molecular weight between crosslinks was estimated. The structure of the hydrogels was analysed with respect to scaling laws, and it was found that the results obtained with PEG 1500 and PEG 6000 hydrogels are in agreement with theoretical predictions, whereas those obtained with PEG 400 hydrogels are in disagreement. The release properties of PEG hydrogels were studied by the determination of the diffusion coefficient for acebutolol chlorhydrate and by an analysis of the effect of temperature on these coefficients. Finally, these release properties were correlated with the swelling and structural properties of the hydrogels.", 
    "171": "This research study was designed to develop model extended-release (ER) matrix tablet formulations for metoprolol tartrate (100 mg) sufficiently sensitive to manufacturing variable and to serve as the scientific basis for regulatory policy development on scale-up and post approval changes for modified-release dosage forms (SUPAC-MR). Several grades and levels of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (Methocel K4M, K15M, K100M and K100LV), fillers and binders and studied. Three granulation processes were evaluated; direct compression, fluid-bed or high-shear granulation. Lubrication was performed in a V-blender and tablets were compressed on an instrumented rotary tablet press. Direct compression formulations exhibited poor flow, picking and sticking problems during tableting. High-shear granulation resulted in the formation of hard granules that were difficult to mill but yielded good tablets. Fluid-bed granulations were made using various binders and appeared to be satisfactory in terms of flow and tableting performance. In vitro drug release testing was performed in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer using USP apparatus 2 (paddle) at 50 rpm. At a fixed polymer level, drug release from the higher viscosity grades (K100M) was slower as compared to the lower viscosity grades (K100LV). In addition, release from K100LV was found to be more sensitive to polymer level changes. Increased in polymer level from 10 to 40% and/or filler change from lactose to dicalcium phosphate resulted in about 25-30% decrease in the amount of metoprolol release after 12 h. The results of this study led to the choice of Methocel K100LV as the hydrophilic matrix polymer and fluid-bed granulation as the process of choice for further evaluation of critical and non-critical formulation and processing variables."
