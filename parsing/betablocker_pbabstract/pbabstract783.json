    "0": "Intravenous infusion of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor stimulatory agent, increased serum gastrin concentration significantly more in patients with a duodenal ulcer than in healthy subjects. The rise in pulse rate, blood glucose concentration and in serum insulin was the same in both groups of subjects. Gastrin secretion was also increased significantly more in the patients than in the control subjects after a beef-meal. Basal serum gastrin concentrations were higher in the patients than in the control subjects and correlated to the rise in serum gastrin during both tests in the patients with a duodenal ulcer. Isoproterenol and meal stimulated gastrin secretion, expressed as percent of the basal value, were twice as higher in the patients as in the control subjects. The combined administration of isoproterenol and the meal had an additive effect on the rise in serum gastrin. Isoproterenol stimulated gastrin secretion was completely suppressed by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, which had no effect on meal stimulated gastrin secretion. It is concluded that the mechanism of the hypersecretion of gastrin in patients with a duodenal ulcer did not involve a specific abnormality of the beta-adrenergic receptor or the receptor which recognized proteins and their digested products. There is no established role of beta-adrenergic receptor activity in the hypersecretion of gastrin in patients with duodenal ulcers. It is suggested that the beta-adrenergic receptor may have some yet unknown function unrelated to the acute secretory response of gastrin.", 
    "1": "The effects of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine on the levels of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and the activity of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells were studied. Cyclic AMP was very slightly (5 to 13%) increased in cells incubated with phenylephrine at a concentration (10(-5) M) which was maximally effective on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. However, the increase was significant only at 5 min. Cyclic AMP levels with 10(-5) M phenylephrine measured at this time were reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, but were unaffected by the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine, indicating that the elevation was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. When doses of glucagon, epinephrine, and phenylephrine which produced the same stimulation of glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis were added to the same batches of cells, there were marked rises in cAMP with glucagon, minimal increases with epinephrine, and little or no changes with phenylephrine, indicating that the two catecholamine stimulated these processes largely by mechanisms not involving cAMP accumulation. DEAE-cellulose chromatography of homogenates of liver cells revealed two major peaks of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These eluted at similar salt concentrations as the type I and II isozymes from rat heart. Optimal conditions for preservation of hormone effects on the activity of the enzyme in the cells were determined. High concentrations of phenylephrine (10(-5) M and 10(-4) M) produced a small increase (10 tp 16%) in the activity ratio (-cAMP/+cAMP) of the enzyme. This was abolished by propranolol, but not by phenoxybenzamine, indicating that it was due to weak beta activity of the agonist. The increase in the activity ratio of the kinase with 10(-5) M phenylephrine was much smaller than that produced by a glycogenolytically equivalent dose of glucagon. The changes in protein kinase induced by phenylephrine and the blockers and by glucagon were thus consistent with those in cAMP. Theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, which inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, potentiated the effects of phenylephrine on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The potentiations were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, but not by propranolol. Methylisobutylxanthine increased the levels of cAMP and enhanced the activation of protein kinase in cells incubated with phenylephrine. These effects were diminished or abolished by propanolol, but were unaffected by phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded from these data that alpha-adrenergic activation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells occurs by mechanisms not involving an increase in total cellular cAMP or activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results also show that phosphodiesterase inhibitors potentiate alpha-adrenergic actions in hepatocytes mainly by a mechanism(s) not involving a rise in cAMP.", 
    "2": "Epinephrine and the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine activated phosphorylase, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis from lactate in a dose-dependent manner in isolated rat liver parenchymal cells. The half-maximally active dose of epinephrine was 10-7 M and of phenylephrine was 10(-6) M. These effects were blocked by alpha-adrenergic antagonists including phenoxybenzamine, but were largely unaffected by beta-adrenergic antagonists including propranolol. Epinephrine caused a transient 2-fold elevation of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) which was abolished by propranolol and other beta blockers, but was unaffected by phenoxybenzamine and other alpha blockers. Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol were shown to be specific for their respective adrenergic receptors and to not affect the actions of glucagon or exogenous cAMP. Neither epinephrine (10-7 M), phenylephrine (10-5 M), nor glucagon (10-7 M) inactivated glycogen synthase in liver cells from fed rats. When the glycogen synthase activity ratio (-glucose 6-phosphate/+ glucose 6-phosphate) was increased from 0.09 to 0.66 by preincubation of such cells with 40 mM glucose, these agents substantially inactivated the enzyme. Incubation of hepatocytes from fed rats resulted in glycogen depletion which was correlated with an increase in the glycogen synthase activity ratio and a decrease in phosphorylase alpha activity. In hepatocytes from fasted animals, the glycogen synthase activity ratio was 0.32 +/- 0.03, and epinephrine, glucagon, and phenylephrine were able to lower this significantly. The effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine on the enzyme were blocked by phenoxybenzamine, but were largely unaffected by propranolol. Maximal phosphorylase activation in hepatocytes from fasted rats incubated with 10(-5) M phenylephrine preceded the maximal inactivation of glycogen synthase. Addition of glucose rapidly reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, both basal and phenylephrine-elevated phosphorylase alpha activity in hepatocytes prepared from fasted rats. Glucose also increased the glycogen synthase activity ratio, but this effect lagged behind the change in phosphorylase. Phenylephrine (10-5 M) and glucagon (5 x 10(-10) M) decreased by one-half the fall in phosphoryalse alpha activity seen with 10 mM glucose and markedly suppressed the elevation of glycogen synthase activity. The following conclusions are drawn from these findings. (a) The effects of epinephrine and phenylephrine on carbohydrate metabolism in rat liver parenchymal cells are mediated predominantly by alpha-adrenergic receptors. (b) Stimulation of these receptors by epinephrine or phenylephrine results in activation of phosphorylase and gluconeogenesis and inactivation of glycogen synthase by mechanisms not involving an increase in cellular cAMP. (c) Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine leads to the accumulation of cAMP, but this is associated with minimal activation of phosphorylase or inactivation of glycogen synthase...", 
    "3": "We studied the effects of cigarette smoking, sham smoking and smoking during adrenergic blockade in 10 subjects to determine whether smoking released the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine, as well as the adrenomedullary hormone epinephrine, and whether smoking-associated hemodynamic and metabolic changes were mediated through adrenergic mechanisms. Smoking-associated increments in mean (+/- S.E.M.) plasma norepinephrine (227 +/- 23 to 324 +/- 39 pg per milliliter, P less than 0.01) and epinephrine (44 +/- to 113 +/- 27 pg per milliliter, P less than 0.05) were demonstrated. Smoking-associated increments in pulse rate, blood pressure, blood glycerol and blood lactate/pyruvate ratio were prevented by adrenergic blockade; increments in plasma growth hormone and cortisol were not. Since significant smoking-associated increments, in pulse rate, blood pressure and blood lactate/pyruvate ratio, preceded measurable increments in plasma catecholamine concentrations, but were adrenergically mediated, these changes should be attributed to norepinephrine released locally from adrenergic axon terminals within the tissues rather than to increments in circulating catecholamines.", 
    "4": "Sodium bicarbonate has modified or reversed arrhythmias due to tricyclic antidepressants in 11 children. It has proved to be the most clinically effective method of treatment of these arrhythmias in children, and reference is made to experimental studies which support this view.", 
    "5": "Human plasma contains renin, which is enzymatically active at neutral pH (active renin), and a non-dialysable factor, which has renin-like activity after treatment at low pH (inactive renin). In vitro activated plasma-renin and purified human renal renin showed identical enzyme-kinetic properties. Quantitative estimations of inactive renin in renal venous plasma from 5 patients with renal-artery stenosis demonstrated its release by the kidney. Acute stimulation of renin release by isoprenaline, tilting, or diazoxide in 13 normotensive individuals and in 9 patients with essential hypertension increased active plasma-renin and reduced inactive plasma-renin. Inactive plasma-renin was increased and active plasma-renin decreased during suppression of renin release by propranolol in 12 patients with essential hypertension. In 55 patients with various disorders, inactive and active plasma-renin were directly correlated. However, the concentration of inactive renin, for a given value of active renin, varied widely from patient to patient. These results indicate that so-called inactive renin is indeed physiologically related to active renin. They also suggest that inactive renin can be activated not only in vitro, but also in vivo. Different renin assays measure different relative amounts of active and inactive renin. This may call for reinterpretation of results obtained by various methods, especially in situations where changes in plasma concentrations of the two forms of renin are in opposite directions.", 
    "6": "The beta-receptor blocker Timolol was investigated for 28 weeks in a double blind trial and then for up to 100 weeks in an open trial in patients with angina pectoris. In both phases of the investigation. Timolol caused a quite marked regression in the frequency of attacks and in the pulse rate at rest. The evaluation of therapeutic success by doctor and patient was positive for Timolol.", 
    "7": "Experimental myocardial infarction (EMI) was reproduced in 35 of 40 rabbits operated upon. Ampouled obsidan was slowly introduced to 12 rabbits with EMI directly after ligation of the coronary arteries and once during each subsequent two days into the marginal otic vein. The results of the antiarrhythmic action of the drug were judged about from the data of a dynamic ECG-observation in 3 standard leads. From the information thus obtained it followed that a single administration of obsidan to rabbits in the acute period of EMI (the first 3 days of the experiment) prevented the development of complex disturbances of the rhythm and reduced the lethality rate among the animals. In repeated injections of the drug it is necessary to take account of the preceding arrhythmias. Reintroduction of obsidan to rabbits with EMI complicated by sinus bradycardia and ventricular extrasystole is prognostically dangerous (ventricular extrasystole relapses and its transformation into ventricular tachycardia is possible). At later stages of EMI these animals succumbod due to complex disturbances of the rhythm and conduction.", 
    "8": "The relationship between heart rate deceleration (HRD) and the contingent negative variation (CNV) was evaluated in 12 healthy, elderly men during performance of a signaled reaction time task. While amplitude of the CNV and HRD did parallel RT, CNV alone was found to be predictive of individual differences in speed of response indicating that phasic concordance of these physiological responses is probably not an important factor in age changes in RT. The results indicate the probable importance of central physiological indices such as the CNV over peripheral events such as HRD in the evaluation of RT performance in elderly individuals.", 
    "9": "A 25 year old male with features typical of Bartter's syndrome is described. Studies were performed to evaluate the pathogenesis of this disorder. In response to oral water loading the subject excreted free water normally. Normal renal sodium conservation was documented. Autonomy of the reninangiotensin-aldosterone system was excluded by demonstrating appropriate directional changes in plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion in response to alterations in sodium and potassium intake. During aminoglutethimide inhibition of aldosterone synthesis the subject was able to maintain potassium balance at a normal serum potassium concentration on a potassium intake of 130 mEq/day which suggests that aldosterone is the major cause of the potassium wasting. Decreased vascular responses to intra-arterial infusions of angiotensin II and norepinephrine were documented in the absence of extracellular volume depletion. These findings argue against tachyphylaxis as the explanation for the vascular insensitivity and implicate a defect at some step in the sequence between agonist-receptor interaction and the contractile response. It is proposed that the vascular defect plays a primary role in the pathogenesis of the hyperreninemia by interrupting pressure-mediated inhibition of renin secretion and/or impairing direct feedback inhibition of renin secretion by angiotensin II. A unique finding in our case was the lack of a postural influence on plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone. An accentuated plasma aldosterone circadian rhythm was observed independent of plasma renin activity and plasma potassium concentration. Dexamethasone suppression of ACTH reduced but did not abolish the circadian rhythm. Thus some factor in addition to plasma renin activity, potassium and ACTH appears to influence aldosterone secretion in this patient.", 
    "10": "The mechanism by which beta adrenergic agonist stimulate glycogenolysis in intact skeletal muscle was investigated in mice with the phosphorylase kinase deficiency mutation (I strain). Although extracts of I strain diaphragm muscle had only 3.7% of the phosphorylase kinase activity found in extracts of the control strain (C57BL), incubation of I strain hemidiaphragms in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with either isoproterenol or epinephrine resulted in a stimulation of the rate of glycogenolysis. In C57BL diaphragms, the EC50 values for isoproterenol and epinephrine were 2 and 14 nM, respectively. With I strain diaphragms, dl-isoproterenol or l-epinephrine stimulated glycogenolysis as a linear function of the log of the drug concentration with no apparent plateau of response up to concentrations of 30 to 40 mugM. For each 10-fold increase in drug concentration, isoproterenol and epinephrine stimulated glycogenolysis in I strain muscles an additional 0.37 to 0.42 mg/g/hr, a slope in the concentration-response relationship of 0.17 and 0.37, respectively, of that measured in C57BL diaphragms at concentrations around the EC50. The highest glycogenolytic response measured in I strain hemidiaphragms (at 40 mugM isoproterenol) was 80% of the maximal catecholamine-stimulated glycogenolysis in C57BL diaphragms. Both 4 nM and 4 mugM isoproterenol, in a concentration-dependent manner, stimulated phosphorylase b to a conversion in I and C57BL diaphragms and increased cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentrations. The glycogenolytic response to 10.1 nM dl-isoproterenol in both I and C57BL diaphragms was blocked by 34 nM l-propranolol but not by 34 nM d-propranolol. The response to 4 mugM isoproterenol was enhanced by the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitors papaverine (27 mugM) or dl-4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 20-1724, 3 mugM). From the results of these studies, we conclude: 1) Catecholamines stimulate glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle of I mice, as in C57BL mice, by interacting with the beta adrenergic receptor, thereby increasing tissue cyclic AMP concentrations and stimulating phosphorylase b to a conversion. 2) alternative hypotheses for the mechanism of the catecholamine-stimulated decrease in glycogen concentration in I skeletal muscle-inhibition of glycogen synthesis, hyposia and 5'-AMP stimulation of phosphorylase b activity-have been ruled out. 3) the activity of the mutant phosphorylase kinase, although it is only 3.7% of that in extracts of C57BL muscle, is sufficient to produce phosphorylase b to a conversion and thereby account for the glycogenolytic response of I strain muscle to catecholamines.", 
    "11": "The behavioral and electrographic effects of DL-amphetamine, disulfiram, FLA-63, and propranolol on the photically induced epilepsy of the Senegalese baboon were evaluated. Amphetamine produced somatic hypokinesia with enhancement of eye movements, diminution of spontaneous paroxysmal activity, and little change in photosensitivity. The acute effects of disulfiram and FLA-63 were poor, but the latter was lethal in the days following administration. Propranolol showed no consistent effects. Participation of catecholamine processes in this type of experimental reflex epilepsy are discussed.", 
    "12": "1. Circulating catecholamines and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) have been studied in a child with bilateral phaeochromocytoma. 2. Venous catheterization showed a great increase in catecholamine efflux from the left adrenal vein while DbetaH activity in the latter was only slightly elevated. 3. Circulating catecholamines fluctated greatly while DbetaH activity decreased gradually during the removal of the tumours. 4. Post-operatively, circulating catecholamines declined to normal values while DbetaH activity returned to pre-operative levels. 5. It is concluded that these tumours released circulating catecholamines independent of an exocytotic secretion of DbetaH and that the circulating DbetaH reflected the activity of the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "13": "1. The effects of single oral doses of propranolol, practolol and a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, metoprolol, on exercise-induced tachycardia in relation to plasma levels were studied in six normal volunteers. 2. Exercise undertaken on treadmill was submaximal which, under control conditions, increased the heart rate from 74-3 (s.e.m. = 6-8) to 153-8 (s.e.m. = 9.8) beats/min. 3. Plasma concentrations of propranolol and practolol were assayed fluorometrically and of metoprolol by electron-capture gas liquid chromatography, the details of which are described. 4. Between 1-5 and 2 h after drug ingestion 80 mg of propranolol associated with plasma level of 50-60 ng/ml (half-life 2-75 h), reduced the exercise-induced tachycardia by 27%, 250 mg of practolol with plasma levels of 1050-1100 ng/ml reduced it by 28% and 100 mg of metoprolol with plasma concentrations of 140-150 ng/ml (half-life 1-7 h), reduced it by 30%. 5. The resting heart rates were reduced significantly by propranolol and metoprolol but not by practolol. 6. Metoprolol is a potent short-acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist; its advantages as a cardioselective agent over practolol in therapeutic use are discussed.", 
    "14": "1 Effects of dopamine and noradrenaline were compared in helically-cut strips of canine cerebral arteries. 2 Dopamine caused a greater maximal contraction than noradrenaline, although the ED50 for noradrenaline was appreciably less. The contraction induced by these amines was reversed to a relaxation by treatment with phenoxybenzamine. 3 Relaxation induced by dopamine in phenoxybenzamine-treated and prostaglandin-contracted cerebral arteries was not influenced by 1 muM propranolol, while relaxation induced by noradrenaline at low concentrations (2 muM and 10 muM) was significantly attenuated. Neither aminophylline nor atropine affected the relaxant effect of dopamine. 4 A mechanism other than beta-adrenergic, cholinergic or adenosine-related appears to be involved in the relaxation elicited by dopamine in cerebral arterial strips.", 
    "15": "Adrenergic receptors mediating depolarization in in vitro neonatal rat brown adipose tissue (BAT) have been characterized by use of adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Releasable endogenous catecholamine was present in BAT as demonstrated by tyramine- and 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide- (DMPP) induced depolarization in BAT from normal rats and its absence when BAT from reserpinized rats was used. In BAT from reserpinized rats l-norepinephrine, l-phenylephrine, and l-isoproterenol all similarly depolarized the bronw adipocytes over the concentration range of 10(-8) to 10(-6) M with a maximal depolarization of about 25 mV. Dopamine and d-norepinephrine were more than 100 times less potent. The beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol competitively inhibited isoproterenol-induced depolarization, whereas the alpha-adrenergic blackers, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine, inhibited the phenylephrine-induced depolarization with much smaller inhibitory effects on the isoproterenol-induced depolarization. Both phenylephrine and isoproterenol elicited transient depolarizations when briefly added to the bathing medium while continuously recording from the same cell. Both the agonist and antagonist studies are interpreted as indicating the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors on BAT cells which mediate catecholamine-induced depolarization.", 
    "16": "An acetyl-homologue-metabolite, present in concentrations of up to ten times those of the unchanged drug, in the plasma of patients receiving oral doses of acebutolol, is reported. Combined gas chromatography--mass spectrometry has been utilized to determine the structure of the acetyl-metabolite. This acetyl-metabolite has been measured as acebutolol by previously published non-specific methods for the determination of acebutolol in biological fluids. A specific and sensitive gas chromatographic method is described for the separate quantitation of acebutolol and its acetyl-metabolite in plasma and urine. Using our method, preliminary data on the disposition kinetics of acebutolol are presented. The difficulties in interpreting previously published pharmacokinetic data for acebutolol, based on a non-specific method of analysis, are emphasized.", 
    "17": "Carotid baroreceptors were stimulated with graded neck suction in supine and standing volunteers, before and after autonomic blockade, to determine the influence of posture on baroreflex responsiveness. Propranolol significantly augmented baroreflex pulse interval prolongation in the supine position. Upright posture did not modify baroreflex pulse interval responses prior to propranolol, but significantly augmented responses after propranolol. The results suggest that standing enhances baroreflex sensitivity, but that under normal circumstances, this effect is masked by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Augmentation of baroreflex pulse interval prolongation in the supine and standing positions by propranolol may contribute to the effectiveness of this drug in angina pectoris and labile hypertension.", 
    "18": "The action of amiodarone (1.5 X 10(-5) M) on sinus node activity of spontaneously beating isolated right atria of rabbit at 30 degrees C was investigated using a microelectrode technique. The drug significantly increased the action potential duration and decreased the slope of diastolic depolarization, both effects leading to a reduction of the sinus rate. In contrast to beta-blocking agents, amiodarone reduced but did not completely abolish the adrenergic effects on the sinus node activity. It is concluded that the amiodarone-induced bradycarida observed in clinical trials might be due to a direct effect of the drug on the sinus node.", 
    "19": "Experiments were performed in isolated guinea pig hearts, perfused at constant volume. Left ventricular pressure, left ventricular dp/dtmax, coronary vascular pressure and coronary venous pO2 were measured continuously. Indomethacin (1.4 X 10(-6) M) increased coronary vascular resistance by 15% over control (p less than 0.01) without altering the myocardial contractile force. When PGE2 (1.4 X10(-8) M) was subsequently added, it abolished the indomethacin action and lowered the coronary vascular resistance below the pre-indomethacin control value. This increase in coronary vascular resistance caused by indomethacin was also seen when the animals were pretreated with reserpine and/or the adrenoceptor blocking agents phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, but was prevented completely by previous addition of PGE2 (1.4 X 10(-7) M). The results provide evidence for possible involvement of endogenous prostaglandin-like substances in the maintenance of coronary vascular resistance in the isolated guinea pig heart.", 
    "20": "Water-immersion stress for 7, 14, or 20 hr consistently induced linear or punctate stress ulcers (mucosal erosions) in the corpus of the stomach in intact rats. When the pylorus of the stomach had been ligated prior to stressing, the stress ulcers changed their morphological feature (mainly punctate and in one place elongated) and location (both in corpus and antrum). Histologically, the stress ulcer developed in the proximal antrum of pylorus ligated rats and penetrated into the muscularis mucosa. Sodium bicarbonate, chlorpromazine, hexamethonium, atropine, metiamide, and bilateral vagotomy markedly inhibited the stress ulcers which developed in the pylorus-ligated rats. Phentolamine and propranolol hardly affected the development of stress ulcers. Amylopectine evoked a new type of stress ulcer in the corpus when it was given to the pylorus-ligated rats.", 
    "21": "The effect of several agents active on autonomic nervous system functions was tested on brain oxygen autoregulation parameters. It was found that atropine, propranolol and isoproterenol had no influence in abolishing the measured parameters. Phenoxybenzamine, tolazoline and dibenamine all suppress autoregulation. In an additional experimental series, a phenoxybenzamine infusion was given during O2 breathing. The infusion induced, in most cases, an additional rise in TpO2 (tissue pressure of oxygen, which refers to the partial pressure [in mm Hg] of this gas at the measuring tip of the electrode). It is concluded that an alpha-adrenergic mechanism is part of the autoregulation process. Also, the increase in brain TpO2 induced by 59% O2-5% Co2 breathing seems to be blocked or reversed by alpha-adrenolytic drugs, thus supporting the thinking that the effect of CO2 on cerebral blood flow is at least in part mediated through an alpha-adrenergic response.", 
    "22": "Total loss of the autonomic regulation of heart rate is described in a 28-year-old diabetic with extensive autonomic neuropathy. The patient had an almost fixed heart rate that barely responded to any of the tests that stimulate or inhibit the autonomic nerves. Its behavior was similar to that of the transplanted heart.", 
    "23": "This study was intended to examine the role of hypothalamic norepinephrine (HNE) and dopamine (HDA) in episodic luteinizing hormone (LH) release in adult ovariectomized rats. Unrestrained, unanesthetized rats with indwelling right atrial cannulae were bled continuously (30, 50, or 100 mul of whole blood/4-6 min for 3-4 hours), and the blood samples were analyzed for LH by radio-immunoassay. In other individual rats, changes in the hypothalamic levels of norepinephrine and dopamine after drug administration were determined by a radioisotopic-enzymatic catechol-O-methyl transferase assay. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine significantly decreased HNE and HDA concentrations but failed to alter episodic LH release. Two dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitors (U-14,624 and FLA-63) caused marked reductions in HNE, small but not statistically significant increases in HDA, and an inhibition of episodic LH secretion. Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor stimulator, caused a transient (50-60 min) but marked inhibition of episodic LH release. Saline injection had no effect. Pimozide, a blocker of dopamine receptors, prevented the inhibitory effects seen following apomorphine. Although not studied in detail, pimozide alone did not appear to alter episodic LH secretion. These data suggest that in adult ovariectomized rats norepinephrine may be an excitatory neurotransmitter in the modulation of episodic LH release. The activation of dopamine receptors may be capable of inhibiting this release process. However, the apparent inability of pimozide alone to alter episodic LH discharge suggests that under physiological conditions dopamine may not play a role in the modulation of episodic LH secretion.", 
    "24": "Stimulation of the midbrain during acute combined arterial hypoxia and hypercapnea produces serious cardiac dysrhythmias which are not evoked when stimulation is elicited either with normal arterial blood gas tensions or with isolated mild hypercapnea. The cardiac dysrhythmias are mediated by both enhanced sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent discharge. The results support the concept that increased autonomic activity in combination with acute arterial hypoxia and hypercapnea contribute significantly to the exhibition of serious cardiac rhythm disturbances. Acute hypoxia appears to be the major determinant of such dysrhythmias.", 
    "25": "The electrophysiologic effects of intravenously administered propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) on three parameters of sinus node function were examined in ten symptomatic patients with sinus node dysfunction. The patients ranged in age from 26 to 79 years. Symptoms ranged from fatigue to frank syncope. Sinoatrial (SA) block and sinus pauses were observed in one patient; sinus pauses alone were observed in three patients. Five (5/10) patients had intraatrial block; three (3/10) patients had atrioventricular block; four (4/10) patients had an intraventricular conduction disturbance. At the time of electrophysiologic study, two patients had a control spontaneous sinus cycle length that exceeded 1000 msec. Following propranolol, the mean spontaneous cycle length increased by 17.4% (924 to 1085 msec, P less than 0.005) and spontaneous second degree SA block reappeared in the one patient. The maximum escape cycle ranged from 116% to 229% of the prepacing spontaneous cycle length and was considered to be prolonged in two of ten patients. Propranolol had no significant effect on the maximum escape cycle/prepacing cycle length X 100 (%). The estimated sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was determined in seven patients and ranged in value from 120 to 238 mes. Propranolol increased the mean value of the estimated SACT from 179 to 213 msec, P less than 0.025. Propranolol may cause marked bradyarrhythmias in some patients with sinus node dysfunction, and should be used with caution in these patients.", 
    "26": "In four experiments, immature Athens Randombred (ARB) chickens were maintained at a moderate temperature, (24 degrees C., 45% R.H.). In Exps. 1 and 2 reserpine was given intramuscularly (0.75 mg./kg.) 12 hours before the heating episode was begun; in Exp. 3, propranolol was given intravenously (4 mg./kg.) 2 hours before heating; and in Exp. 4, dihydroergotamine was given intramuscularly (4 mg./kg.) 6 hours before heating. Rserpine and propranolol elevated plasma corticosterone before the heating episode began, but dihydorergotamine did not. Reserpine also raised plasma glucose levels before heating, but propranolol and dihdroergotamine did not. During the heating episodes, plasma glucose and plasma corticosterone increased in non-drug-treated birds; the increases were then followed by significant declines. In birds treated with reserpine, propranolol, and dihydroergotamine, however, elevated plasma corticosterone was maintained throughout the period of heating. Propranolol and dihydroergotamine also stabilized plasma glucose at higher levels during heating, but reserpine permitted the late period decline similar to that of non-drug-treated birds. These results indicate an adrenal cortical insufficiency during heat stroke and death in young chickens.", 
    "27": "On the basis of 150 results on patients who underwent an ECG at submaximal exercise, selective coronary arteriography and cine-arteriography, this study has established that: -- certain elecerographic criteria of coronary insufficiency which have a high predictive value in males (a \"near ischeamic\" appearance, an J depression at or above 4 mm) are not applicable to the female; -- where an ECG tracing which is abnormal at rest becomes normal on exercise, then in both males and females there is a healthy coronary tree; -- the incidence of false-positives is 22.9%, which is 4 times that found in males; -- propranolol (60 mg orally) returns these pseudo-ischaemic changes in the resting and exercise ECG to normal and affords a simple method of identifying the false positives.", 
    "28": "Behavior of squirrel monkeys was maintained under comparable 30-response fixed-ratio schedules of cocaine injection or fooc presentation. Every 30th key press in the presence of a green light produced an intravenous injection of 25 mug/kg of cocaine in one group of monkeys or delivery of a food pellet in a second group of monkeys. Each cocaine injection or food presentation was followed by a 1-minute timeout period, during which the green light was absent and responses had no programmed consequences. Responding at a mean rate of more than 1/sec was maintained in the presence of the green light during each daily session. Propranolol doses from 0.3 to 3.0 mg/kg i.m. had no effect on food-maintained responding but decreased cocaine-maintained responding by approximately 30%. The selective disruption of cocaine-maintained responding by propranolol appeared to depend on the cumulative cocaine dose. Decreases in cocaine-maintained responding after propranolol became increasingly pronounced as the session progressed. Similar progressive decreases in cocaine-maintained responding were produced by increasing the dose of cocaine per injection.", 
    "29": "1. The distribution of intrarenal blood flow has been measured using the 133Xe-washout technique in thirteen baboons 2 weeks after ligation of the common bile duct. 2. In comparison with eight sham-operated baboons, there was a signifigant decrease in the percentage distribution of blood to the cortex, although the rate of flow was unchanged. These changes were accompanied by a significantly increased flow rate and percentage distribution of flow through the juxtameduallary circulation. 3. In a further five baboons treated in the same way, various doses of noradrenaline were infused into the renal artery. In these animals there was an enhanced pressor response to noradrenaline, and this effect was completely abolished by an alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent (phenoxybenzamine). The beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug (propranolol) had no such effect. 4. This enhanced response was not seen when noradrenaline was infused into three sham-operated baboons. 5. These observations suggest that the alterations in renal perfusion in obstructive jaundice may be due to an increase renovascular sensitivity to circulating catecholamines and an enhanced alpha-adrenoceptor activity.", 
    "30": "Sudden coronary death from ventricular fibrillation is the biggest and possibly the most remediable of the major public health problems at the moment. Most of those liable to sudden death can be identified and it is possible that by the use of beta-adrenergic blocking or other antiarrhythmic drugs, by reducing the consumption of cigarettes and perhaps, by different therapies for hypertension, a substantial proportion of coronary deaths might be prevented or, at least, postponed.", 
    "31": "Unstable angina is a syndrome which comprises a spectrum of symptomatic manifestations of coronary artery disease which lies between stable angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction. Patients fall into three groups: angina of recent onset (4 weeks), angina of changing pattern, and angina occurring at rest (longer than 15 minutes). The syndrome may presage acute myocardial infarction or sudden death, or may itself be the manifestation of a myocardial infarction. The pathophysiology may involve primary cardiac events or extracardiac precipitating factors, and does not appear to be the consequence of a particular anatomic pattern of coronary artery disease. Pain may occur as a result of regional reduction of coronary flow to pressure-dependent areas of myocardium during states of increased myocardial oxygen demand. Persisting ischemia leads to infarction via a series of events which may include myocardial edema formation, increased beta-sympathetic tone, and others which have been experimentally modified by interventions designed to limit infarct size. Although the incidence of acute myocardial infarction and death was high in early studies, in recent reports acute infarction occurs in under 15.5 per cent and death in under 2 per cent. Patients at high risk are those pain persists with bed rest, and those with preceding stable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Prognostic differences among Groups 1, 2, and 3 may exist but cannot be assessed from available studies. Studies of the management of unstable angina have generally been uncontrolled. Hospitalization, bed rest, and short- and long-acting nitrates are generally employed in Groups 2 and 3 patients and the marked reduction in myocardial infarction rates from early to recent studies tends to support these approaches. Anticoagulants are less used now than formerly. Propranolol can produce a significant reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption and may redirect coronary flow to ischemic areas. The drug has effectively controlled pain in several studies and is now widely used to manage unstable angina. Aortocoronary bypass surgery has been extensively employed but there is only one preliminary report of a controlled study available. The role of surgery is not yet defined. The optimal approach to therapy may eventually involve the use of medical therapy, including beta-blockade to stabilize patients, with delayed semielective coronary angiography and surgery in those who respond. Emergency angiography and surgery might then be reserved for the high-risk group of patients whose pain persists during optimal medical therapy.", 
    "32": "The thyrocalcitonin (TCT) effect under influence of some factors affecting the activity of membrane adenylcyclase (AC) of the ventricle myocardial cells in cold-blooded animals, was studied. The TCT positive inotropic effect is intensified by decrease in the potassium concentration in the medium, by blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors with phentolamine, and inhibited by increase in the potassium concentration and blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors. The TCT action is preserved in presence of adrenaline.", 
    "33": "The responses of type A atrial receptors to graded infusions of saline and large doses of propranolol were examined in anesthetized cats. Infusion of saline raised the mean atrial pressure, but usually the amplitude of the atrial a wave was reduced. In general the receptor discharge was unaffected. Propranolol reduced the discharge from the control level when it was injected in doses no less than 4 mg/kg. Infusions of saline after propranolol resulted in an increase in the discharge and the increase was related to the amplitude and/or initial pressure of the a wave. In one case the discharge after propranolol was less than that when the atrium was widely slit open. It is concluded that at least part of the effect of the drug is due to a direct depression of the receptor rendering it less sensitive to the stretch provided by atrial contraction. The demonstration of a stimulus-response relationship between the a wave and the receptor discharge at low levels of activity suggests that under normal conditiions the receptor operates on a plateau of maximum activity, thus making a response to small changes in stimulus strength obscure.", 
    "34": "There is some evidence in the literature that catecholamines relax uterine and other types of smooth muscle by increasing tissue levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP). In the present study, isoproterenol completely relaxed uterine strips obtained from estrogen-primed rats and also increased tissue levels of cyclic AMP and phosphorylase a. In uterine strips depolarized and put into contracture for 15 minutes by 127 mM K+, isoproterenol did not increase phosphorylase a or cyclic AMP but was still capable of producing relaxation. When uterine strips were exposed to the methoxy derivative of verapamil, D-600, a compound known to prevent the influx of calcium, the uterus relaxed completely without an increase in cyclic AMP. The addition of isoproterenol at this stage resulted in an increase in cyclic AMP similar to that noted in nondepolarized uterine strips. The addition of 127 mM K+ also resulted in time-dependent biochemical changes as well as contracture. Cyclic AMP was increased 3-fold after 2 minutes of K+ depolarization and phosphorylase a was increased as well. The increase in cyclic AMP was prevented by propranolol but propranolol did not affect the contracture response to K+. D-600 prevented contracture but did not affect the K+-induced increase in cyclic AMP. The data suggest that an increase in whole tissue levels of cyclic AMP are not necessary in order for isoproterenol to relax depolarized rat uterine strips. The data also suggest that intracellular calcium levels can affect the level of cyclic AMP in the rat uterus.", 
    "35": "The effects of exogenous nucleotides on the histamine hypersensitivity of pharmacologically beta-blocked mice were investigated. Female HLA-SW (ICR) mice, 27-29 gm, were injected intraperitoneally with 20 to 100 mug of propranolol 45 min before intraperitoneal challenge with 1 mg histamine. These animals had a mortality which averaged approximately 80%. At various time intervals before histamine, doses of from 0.5 to 12 mumoles of nucleotides were administered intravenously. Noncyclic nucleotides, adenosine, adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), and guanosine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) showed clear, dose-response protection against histamine death of propranolol-treated mice when they were given 45 to 90 min before histamine. Cyclic AMP showed significant protection only when it was given at a dose of 8 mumoles 45 to 90 min before histamine, and lower or higher doses gave equivocal or no protection. Cyclic GMP WAS Not protective at any dose tested. Propranolol treatment also produced enhanced sensitivity to passive systemic anaphylaxis. Mice were passively sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of mouse anti-egg albumin antibody 6 hr before intravenous challenge with 0.5 mg egg albumin. The mortality from anaphylaxis in the group treated with 20 mug propranolol 45 min before antigen challenge increased to 83%, while that of the group not given propranolol was only 10%. Nucleotides were given intravenously 45 min before antigen challenge. The nucleotides that protected mice from death due to histamine challenge also protected them from death due to systemic anaphylaxis. These protective nucleotides were the same nucleotides that had been reported previously to be protective against Bordetella pertussis-induced hypersensitivity to histamine and anaphylaxis.", 
    "36": "The locus and mechanism of interaction of clonidine with catecholamine-elicited accumulations of cyclic AMP has been investigated in brain slices from control and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats of the F-344 and Sprague-Daeley strains. The inhibitory effects of clonidine on the norepinephrine-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP and the potentiative effects of clonidine on the isoproterenol-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP are present to the same extent in cerebral cortical slices from control and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated Sprague-Dawley rats. Clonidine, at concentrations between 0.0001 and 100 muM has no intrinsic stimulatory activity on cortical cyclic AMP-generating systems from either control or 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats. In F-344 rats phenoxybenzamine (100 muM) elicits a significant accumulation of cyclic AMP in cerebral cortical slices which can be abolished by pretreatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine, or by incubation of tissue slices with either clonidine or sotalol. The hyperresponsiveness to catecholamines usually observed following central administration of 6-hydroxydopamine failed to develop in the F-344 rat. Concentrations of phenoxybenzamine which have no significant stimulatory effects on cyclic AMP accumulation are capable of abolishing the potentiative effects of clonidine on the isoproterenol-stimulated formation of cyclic AMP. The beta-antagonist, sotalol, is a less effective antagonist of isoproterenol-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP in the presence of clonidine. Clonidine has no significant effect on the accumulation of cyclic AMP elicited by submaximal concentrations of isoproterenol in cerebellar slices. In toto, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that both the inhibitory effects on norepinephrine-stimulated accumulation of cyclic AMP and the stimulatory effects of clonidine on isoproterenol-elicited accumulation of cyclic AMP are exerted at postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. No evidence was found for a presynaptic generation of cyclic AMP, although clonidine does reverse the stimulatory effects of phenoxybenzamine on cyclic AMP accumulation, presumably by interaction with a presynaptic site controlling norepinephrine release.", 
    "37": "Several derivatives of tetrahydroisoquinoline were injected bilaterally into the nucleus accumbens of rat 2 h after a nialamide pretreatment and activity recorded in cages fitted with photocells. 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinoline, 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6,7-dihydroxy-1-(3,4-dihydroxybenzyl)-isoquinoline (tetrahydropapaveroline) and 6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline caused virtually no change in locomotor activity and 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and 2-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline caused only modest hyperactivity responses. However, 3-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and 3-methyl-6,7-methylenedioxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline were both shown to markedly increase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Of these two compounds, the 3-methyl-6,7-methylenedioxyderivatives was most active and equalled the effectiveness of dopamine. The responses to dopamine and to 3-methyl-6,7-methylenedioxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline were both threshold at 3.125 mug and maximum at 50 mug. Both effects developed within 1-2 h and persisted for at least 6 h. The hyperactivity induced by dopamine was antagonised in a dose-dependent manner by haloperidol: propranolol and aceperone were without effect. Similar results were obtained for these blocking agents against the responses to 3-methyl-6,7-methylenedioxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and 2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline but aceperone and propranolol, in addition to haloperidol, were shown to inhibit the hyperactivity induced by 3-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline.", 
    "38": "The chronotropic effects of midodrine, glycine (10(-8) to 3.10(-3) M), ST1059 and methoxamine (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) were investigated in the spontaneously beating guinea-pig right atrial preparation. Midodrine and glycine produced a slight, but significant rise in atrial rate over a wide concentration range. The midodrine-induced rise in atrial rate was not influenced by the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug propranolol (10(-6) M). The histamine (H2)-receptor blocking drug metiamide (3.10(-5) M) abolished the positive chronotropic actions of both midodrine and glycine. No positive chronotropic effect was seen after the administration of ST 1059 or methoxamine. A decrease in atrial rate was elicited by high concentrations (above 10(-4) to 10(-3) M) of the sympathomimetic agents midodrine, ST 1059, and methoxamine, but not by the amino acid glycine.", 
    "39": "It has been demonstrated that intravenous propranolol produces a 34-60% decrease in normal physiological tremor. The decrease, in response to small doses of the drug (less than 12 mug/kg), was linearly proportional to the baseline tremor size and occurred only following a 10 min delay. It is possible that the effect on tremor is due to the formation of a highly specific centrally acting metabolite of propranolol.", 
    "40": "Hemodynamics and myocardial contractility were evaluated in five unanesthetized calves during acute hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia and during acute hypocapnic hypoxia with beta-adrenergic blockade. Both hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia, with mean PaO2 levels of 33.1 and 39.1 mm Hg respectively, produced a decline in stroke volume and index, while cardiac output and index were maintained at normoxic control levels by an increase in heart rate. Evaluation of myocardial contractility indices suggested an augmentation of left ventricular contractility during both hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia. Beta-adrenergic blockade effectively eliminated the increase in left ventricular contractility during hypocapnic hypoxia, suggesting an important role of the adrenergic nervous system in the genesis of the cardiovascular response of the calf to acute hypoxia. Right ventricular contractility indices failed to demonstrate a clear-cut augmentation of contractility during hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia when the concurrent increase in afterload was considered. Mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure rose significantly during hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia. The pulmonary pressor response to hypocapnic hypoxia was significantly augmented by beta blockade, indicating that the autonomic nervous system is capable of modifying the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in this species.", 
    "41": "We showed in previous studies that pro pranolol produced a pressor action in the rat, and that this action was also observed in the spinal rat infused with adrenaline, noradrenaline and a mixture of isoproterenol and vasopressin, but not with vasopression alone. The action was also observed in the guinea pig infused with adrenergic beta-stimulants. In the present work, conditions in the peripheral vessels in which propranolol observed in the spinal rat infused with a mixture of various doses of isoproterenol and vasopressin. The effect of propranolol on the blood pressure in guinea pigs and rabbits with a reduced vasoconstrictive tone in the peripheral vascular beds with alpha-blockade was studied. Propranolol produced a pressor action in the spinal rat infused with a mixture of isoproterenol and vasopressin, and the magnitude of the rise depended on the mixing rate of the doses of these two drugs. The drug also produced a sustained rise in blood pressure in guinea pigs and rabbits treated with alpha-blockers. Thus, it is concluded that propranolol produces a marked pressor action when peripheral vessels are maintained in conditions with an appropriate constrictive and beta-adrenoceptive vasodilator tone.", 
    "42": "1. A study of the influence of single oral doses of the adrenergic-beta-receptor anatagonists alprenolol (100 mg) and propranolol (50 mg) on the accommodation of the lens was made in six healthy male subjects. 2. There was no significant influence of either drug on lens accommodation.", 
    "43": "1 Adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline (5 mug/ml) did not affect the resting tone of the isolated urinary bladder of the guinea-pig. 2 The catecholamines (1-2 mug/ml) inhibited neuronally evoked contractions at various stimulation frequencies; the inhibition was maximum at 2 Hz and minimum at 50 Hz. Isoprenaline produced maximum inhibition. 3 Propranolol (0.5 mug/ml) completely blocked the catecholamine-induced inhibition at all the frequencies employed. The concentration-response curves of isoprenaline at 2, 10 and 50 Hz were characteristically shifted by propranolol (50 ng/ml). Phenoxybenzamine (0.2 mug/ml) was totally ineffective. 4 In some experiments adrenaline significantly raised the tone of the bladder exposed to propranolol; this effect could be blocked by phenoxybenzamine. 5 Acetylcholine-induced bladder contractions were inhibited by adrenaline (2 mug/ml); the inhibition was completely blocked by propranolol (0.5 mug/ml). 6 The results indicate the presence of an inhibitory beta-adrenoceptor and suggest the possibility of an excitatory alpha-adrenoceptor in guinea-pig urinary bladder.", 
    "44": "The effects of prostaglandin E1, E2, F2alpha (PGE2 PGF2alpha), isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, salbutamol, practolol, atropine, aminophylline, and corticosterone on the hypersensitivity to anaphylaxis, histamine, and serotonin in Bordetella pertussis-treated mice and propranolol-treated mice were investigated. Female HLA-SW (ICR) mice, 27-29 gm, were injected with pertussis vaccine intravenously 4 days before challenge with antigen, histamine, or serotonin. Alternatively, instead of pertussis vaccine, propranolol was injected intraperitoneally 45 min before histamine challenge. Test drugs were administered intraperitoneally 15 min before challenge. PGE1 and PGE2 at a narrow range of between 10 and 100 mug and epinephrine at 100 mug protected both pertussis- and propranolol-treated mice. Isoproterenol (25 mug) and aminophilline (800 mug) protected beta-blocked mice, but did not protect pertussis-treated mice even with very high doses (1,000 and 3,2000 mug, respectively), although salbutamol (500 mug) did. PGF2alpha, norepinephrine, and atropine were not protective at all. Practolol, a beta 1-blocker, given intraperitoneally 30 min before histamine neither sensitized normal mice nor changed the effect of isoproterenol or salbutamol in pertussis-treated mice. Corticosterone 10 mg/kg reduced the number of deaths from histamine in beta-blocked mice, but not in pertussis-treated mice. The protective effect is discussed in connection with probable effects of the drugs on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels.", 
    "45": "The effects of the establishment of an adrenergic blockade on suxamethonium-induced porcine malignant hyperthermia (MH) were investigated in Pietrain pigs. Six animals were fed reserpine 10 mg daily for 7 days and then challenged with suxamethonium. Three survived but the remainder developed fatal MH. In a further study of 10 pigs, either phentolamine 40 mug/kg/min or propranolol 50 mug/kg/min were administered for 30 min before suxamethonium stimulation and continued for the duration of the experiment. The five year beta-blocked pigs all became hyperthermic and died whereas the phentolamine-treated group survived. However, both alpha adrenergic blockade and successful reserpinization failed to prevent the abnormal muscle response to the first dose of suxamethonium.", 
    "46": "The cardiovascular effects of halothane-nitrous oxide anesthesia, and beta-receptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol, were studied in 15 dogs in which severe myocardial infarction had been induced ten days earlier. The hemodynamic responses to blood loss amounting to 25 per cent of estimated blood volume, and its subsequent replacement, were studied before and after induction of beta-receptor blockade. In terms of cardiac output and aortic blood flow acceleration, cardiac performance in the absence of beta-blockade was markedly impaired during steady-state anesthesia, compared with corresponding values in normal dogs. Practolol (2.0 mg/kg) administered during anesthesia induced no significant circulatory change other than a 14 per cent decrease in heart rate and a 25 per cent increase in strode volum. Propranolol (0.3 mg/kg) caused a comparable reduction of heart rate, but significantly reduced cardiac output (-27 per cent), aortic blood flow acceleration (-26 per cent), and peak LV power (-19 per cent), and increased systemic vascular resistance (+49 per cent). The two drugs caused comparable shifts of the isoproterenol dose-response curve during anesthesia. Graduated blood loss during anesthesia, to a total of 25 per cent of blood volume, caused consistent circulatory changes (decreased mean arterial pressure cardiac output, peak LV power, LV minute work) that were essentially similar before and after beta-receptor blockade with either propranolol or practolol. The positive inotropic effect of calcium gluconate during halothane anesthesia was significantly reduced following either propranolol or practolol, but the hemodynamic responses to changes of systemic vascular resistance induced with acetylcholine or phenylephrine were not modified by beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "47": "The changes in the electrical activity of the antrum muscle fibers of the guinea pig stomach caused by ATP and its related compounds were compared with those caused by catecholamines. The antrum preparation exhibited spontaneous electrical activity and this was suppressed or inhibited by treatment with catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline). The inhibitory actions of catecholamines were observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin or alpha-blockers (phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine) while the effects were antagonized by beta-blockers (propranolol or DCI). At higher concentrations than that of catecholamines, ATP or related nucleotides also produced the inhibitory effect on the spike activity and the generation of slow waves. The inhibitory actions of ATP and related substances were still observed in the presence of alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockers. Furthermore, the inhibition was present after treatment with tetrodotoxin. From these results, it is concluded that the inhibitory action of ATP and related compounds is due to a direct action on the antrum muscle and is not mediated via alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "The hypothesis that a neural depressive action is related to the antihypertensive effects of beta blockers has been evaluated in 14 essential hypertensive male patients through the circulatory response to noxious stimuli. The pressor reaction to mental arithmetic was primarily mediated by cardiac stimulation (beta receptors activation), that to cold by vasoconstriction (alpha receptors activation). Arithmetic and cold were tested to separate the effects of peripheral beta blackade from possible neural and other influences. After propanolol (320 mg per day for 3 wk): (1) The baseline pressure was reduced; (2) appearance, peak, and disappearance time of the circulatory reaction to either stimulus was not altered; (3) the pressor effect of arithmetic was decreased in an extent proportional to the reduced rise of cardiac output; and (4) pressure during cold reached the pretreatment levels through an augmented increase of vascular resistance. Our findings indicate that propranolol depresses only the circulatory reactions mediated through beta receptors activation and provide no evidence of effects other than beta blockade.", 
    "49": "Selective coronary arteriography performed on a 41-year-old woman with angina pectoris demonstrated proximal stenosis of the right and left main coronary arteries that was unaffected by nitrate therapy. To exclude coronary artery spasm, the study was repeated, and a striking increase in the narrowing of the right coronary artery was observed. This 90% stenosis was virtually abolished by pretreatment with intravenously given phentolamine hydrochloride. Prolonged alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride improved the patient's exercise tolerance and postexercise electrocardiographic abnormalities when compared to therapy in matched controls given placebo. These observations suggest that alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated coronary artery spasm may mimic organic lesions at coronary arteriography and may be a factor in the pathogenesis of angina pectoris in some patients.", 
    "50": "Cardiac catheterisation with pressure measurements, left-ventricular cine-angiography and selective coronary angiography confirmed the diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in 20 patients. After a mean observation period of 20 months during which most of them were treated with beta-blockers, verapamil, 480 mg by mouth, was given for an average of 12 months. There was an impressive improvement in symptoms, compared with the state under beta-blocker treatment. There was a significant reduction in the ECG signs of left-ventricular hypertrophy and of the radiologically measured heart volume. Treatment of this condition with verapamil appeared to be superior to that with beta-blockers.", 
    "51": "The effect of oxprenolol (100 mg/kg p.o.) on the development of hyperthermia in a shock enclosure and on exploratory and grooming responses in an exploration box, was investigated in rats subjected to inescapable shocks once daily for 5 days. The hyperthermic response of shocked rats was found to be significantly reduced by oxprenolol treatment. Exploratory behavior, which was suppressed by previous exposure to shocks, was not influenced by oxprenolol. However, under oxprenolol treatment grooming diminished from the first day of the trial onward, both in duration and frequency, as though habituation had occurred. The results are interpreted as evidence of partial effectiveness of oxprenolol in suppressing fear-induced somatic and behavioral manifestations.", 
    "52": "Progress in coronary surgery has led to new aspects in the treatment of angina pectoris. According to the coronar-angiographic findings, which make an exact identification of the coronary heart disease possible, and according to the ventricular function a therapeutic strategy can be determined today with adequate safety for each individual case. The most important criterium for a decision for surgical or conservative treatment is not only the improvement of the subjective symptoms, in special forms of coronary heart disease the bypass-operation not only results in improved quality of life but also in a considerably increased survival time.", 
    "53": "Patients with moderate to severe hypertension were studied during a 12-week period, during which they were given a slow release formulation of oxprenolol once daily, in a dosage equal to their previous total daily dose of oxprenolol given in divided doses. There were no systematic differences between blood pressures at the beginning and end of the 12-week period. The once-daily dosage was well tolerated and was preferred by the patients. This regime offers advantages in terms of patient compliance with lifelong therapy in what is usually a symptomless condition.", 
    "54": "(-)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol, a potent competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist, has been previously documented to bind to the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptor sites in mammalian and non-mammalian tissues. Steady state binding of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to sites in frog erythrocyte membranes, a model system for adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors, displays characteristics consistent with negative cooperativity among the beta-adrenergic receptors: Scatchard plots are curvilinear with upward concavity and slopes of Hill plots are consistently less than 1.0. The existence of site-site interactions of the negatively cooperative type were demonstrated directly by the ability of unlabeled (-)-alprenolol to accelerate the dissociation of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol under conditions were no rebinding of radioligand occurred. The dissociation rate of (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol alone is directly related to temperature and increases with increases in temperature from 4-37 degrees. (-)-[3H]Dihydroalprenolol dissociation is enhanced by unlabeled (-)-alprenolol at all temperatures studied; however, at 4 degrees, the time required to observe an enhancement of radioligand dissociated is greater than the time required for unlabeled (-)-alprenolol to occupy the empty receptor sites, suggesting that increased rigidity of the biomembrane at 4 degrees may be responsible for the absence of readily observable site-site interactions. The ability of a number of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists to induce negative cooperativity among the beta-adrenergic receptors was directly related to their affinity for the receptor sites rather than their intrinsic activity in the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic system. The ability to induce site-site interactions among the beta-adrenergic receptors occurs at physiological concentrations of beta-adrenergic agents, since occupancy of less than 10% of the receptor sites is sufficient to reduce receptor affinity. Changes in pH from 6.5 to 9.0 did not significantly alter the negatively cooperative site-site interactions among the receptor sites. The negatively cooperative phenomenon was also independent of Mg2+, Ca2+, and NaF concentrations in the buffer medium. The presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, a nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog which enhances adenylate cyclase stimulation (Vmax) by beta-adrenergic agonists and decreases the concentration of agonist required to half-maximally stimulate adenylate cyclase, did not alter the ability of either agonists or antagonists to induce negatively cooperative site-site interactions among the beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "55": "The effect of DL-propranolol on 3',5'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced experimental porphyria was studied. DL-Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent with non-specific membrane effects, partially inhibited 3',5'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine-induced delta-aminolevulinate synthetase activity both in rats and in chick embryo liver cells in culture. In rats, DL-propranolol decreased urinary delta-aminolevulinate and porphobilinogen but no change occurred in the 24-h urinary excretion of total porphyrins and in the concentration of porphyrins in the liver. In cultured chick embryo liver cells treated with 3',5'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine, DL-propranolol decreased accumulation of porphyrins in the medium. D-Propranolol, oxprenolol and quinidine acted like DL-propranolol in chick embryo liver cells in culture treated with 3',5'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine. Pindolol, practolol and lidocaine had no effect. Phenobarbitone had a synergistic effect on the induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthetase by 3',5'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine in cultures of chick embryo liver cells. This induction was partially inhibited by propranolol. However, the increased accumulation of porphyrins in the medium caused by 3',5'-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine was inhibited by the addition of phenobarbitone. This inhibited induction was further decreased by propranolol. Most of our results indicate that the drugs tested act mainly by their effects on membranes.", 
    "56": "The effects on ventilatory and cardiac function of atenolol, a new cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were compared with those of practolol in a double-blind trial in 12 patients with asthma. Both drugs impaired ventilatory function--atenolol insignificantly and practolol significantly. Atenolol was if anything more cardioselective than practolol. Neither drug interfered significantly with the bronchodilator response to inhaled isoprenaline. Atenolol is suitable for use in patients for whom practolol would formerly have been chosen because of its cardioselectivity.", 
    "57": "Metoprolol and acebutolol, two supposedly cardio-selective beta-adrenergic recptor blocking agents, were tested in healthy volunteers against propranolol, a non-selective drug, for their effect on blood glucose levels during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. There was not significant difference between propranolol and metoprolol, which both potentiated the initial hypoglycaemic action of the insulin and delayed the return to normoglycaemia. Acebutolol, even though potentiating the initial hypoglycaemia, did not possess a significant delaying effect. A similar trial should be undertaken in diabetics to determine with certainty the safety of such drugs in diabetes mellitus.", 
    "58": "It is known that Prostaglandins(PGs) have many interesting physiological effects on various tissues, but the reducing effect on circulating eosinophils was still obscure, except for our report in 1975. Our previous report revealed that the effect had not act through beta-adrenergic receptors, because a beta-adrenergic blocker did not inhibit this effect. The present report was carried out to study whether the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenocortical axis would be concerned or not on this effect. PGs(10 mug/kg) were administered intraperitoneally under thiopental sodium anesthesia and blood was drawn from the tail vein of the splenectomized rats. Both PGE1, E2, F2alpha did not decrease the number of peripheral eosinophils on the group of the adrenalectomized rats. Both PGE1, F2alpha did not decrease the number of peripheral eosinophils, but PGE2 had a significant reducing effect on the number of them 2 and 3 hours after administration in the group of the rats with hypothalamic lesions. Both PGE1, E2, F2alpha had a significant reducing effect at the group of the rats with man-made hypothalamic lesions. This effect was almost the same as for the control group just splenectomized. It could be concluded that the eosinopenic effect of PGE1 and PGF2alpha was conducted through the hypothalamus and adrenal glands, but that of PGE2 might be effected through the hypophysis or directly through the adrenal glands.", 
    "59": "The effects on the heart rate and ECG of anaesthetised guines-pigs of amitriptyline, doxepin, imipramine and nortiptyline infused at 1.0 mg/kg/min until death were observed. In addition an in vitro study on guinea-pig atria was performed on the chronotropic and inotropic effects of these drugs and of desmethylimipramine and protriptyline at a concentration of 10(-5) M. The effect of sodium bicarbonate (3 mEq/kg i.v.) and propranolol (0.01--0.2 mg/kg i.v.) on amitriptyline and doxepin induced ECG changes was also assessed. A difference in the cardiac effects of the in vivo and in vitro model was observed. Guinea-pigs infused with doxepin survived significantly longer than those infused with amitriptyline, imipramine or nortriptyline. No statistically significant difference was found between the tricyclic drugs with respect to onset of widening of the QRS complex, increased PR and QT intervals. In the spontaneously beating atrial preparation doxepin was the most potent cardio-depressant. Sodium bicarbonate had no effect on arrhythmias induced by tricyclics, while propranolol, apart from the bradycardia induced, was without beneficial effect on the ECG. The guinea-pig provides a good model for studying the arrhythmogenic actions of tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "60": "Norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) receptor blockade differentially affected amphetamine self-administration. DA blockade (pimozide, 0.0625 to 0.5 mg/kg, or (+)-butaclamol, 0.0125 to 0.1 mg/kg) caused periods of increased rate of responding for amphetamine which were followed, in the case of higher doses, by response cessation. The response cessation produced by 0.5 mg/kg pimozide was not reversed by non-contingent amphetamine injections until well after the peak effect of the pimozide was over. When access to amphetamine injections was delayed until 4 h after animals received 0.5 mg/kg pimozide, rate of responding was elevated. Thus DA seems to be critically involved in mediation of the reinforcing effects of amphetamine. Alpha-NE blockade with phentolamine (2.5-10 mg/kg) produced dose-related decreases in responding; blockade with phenoxybenzamine (1.25-10 mg/kg) had no effect. Beta-NE blockade with l-propranolol (2.5-10 mg/kg) decreased responding, although probably not through a beta-blocking action. The effects of phentolamine and propranolol do not appear to result from attenuation of the reinforcing effects of amphetamine.", 
    "61": "The effect of acute (intravenous) beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol or pindolol on arterial pressure (BP), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma concentration of aldosterone (PA) was evaluated in 20 essential hypertensive men. BP, PRA and PA were determined during continuous recumbency over-night (8 p.m. to 6 a.m.) every 30 min. Two groups of patients were observed. Patients of group 1 exhibited a characteristic day-night rhythm of PRA with low values before midnight and large increases early in the morning. Conversely, no rhythm and very low PRA values were observed in patients of group II. BP was higher in group II than in group I. In group I following intravenous propranolol or pindolol, BP fell within minutes and levels as well as rhythms of PRA were converted to those of group II without treatment. In group II day-night profiles of PRA and BP remained unchanged. Rhythm and concentration of PA in the two groups were not influenced by either drug. In 4 patients of group I infusion of angiotensin II inhibitor did not lower BP. The observations suggest that in the two groups dissimilarities in rhythms of PRA as well as in BP responses to beta-blockade may reflect differences in neuro-adrenergic tone."
