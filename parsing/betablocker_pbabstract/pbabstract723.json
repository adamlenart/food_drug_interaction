    "0": "Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) synthesize prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha), PGI(2) (measured as 6-keto-PGE(1alpha)), PGE(2), PGD(2), and thromboxane A(2) (measured as thromboxane B(2)). When incubated in the presence of norepinephrine (6 muM), the syntheses of these arachidonic acid metabolites are stimulated 3-fold. Norepinephrine's effect can be antagonized by the addition of alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agents (phenoxybenzamine>phentolamine>yohimbine>dibenamine>tolazoline) but not by the beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol. Norepinephrine's stimulation is also inhibited by low concentrations of dihydroergotamine, bromocryptine, ergocryptine, and ergotamine. The stimulation of PG synthesis by norepinephrine is reversible, continues during the 24 hr of incubation, and requires the presence of norepinephrine at the receptor site but it is not blocked by the addition of colchicine, cytochalasin B, or cycloheximide. Neither phenoxybenzamine nor ergotamine at concentrations that block norepinephrine's stimulation of PG biosynthesis suppresses the increase in PG synthesis induced by exogenous arachidonic acid, suggesting that the alpha-adrenergic regulation is not occurring primarily at the cyclooxygenase step in the metabolism of arachidonic acid. In mouse lymphoma cells (WEHI-5), low concentrations of isoproterenol or norepinephrine stimulate the synthesis of thromboxane, an effect that can be blocked by the addition of propranolol but not by relatively high concentrations of phenoxybenzamine or ergotamine. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation promotes the deacylation of phospholipids by MDCK cells whereas beta-adrenergic mechanisms lead to activation of similar pathways in WEHI-5 cells.", 
    "1": "The aminobenzyl analog of propranolol, 1- (p-amino-alpha,alpha-dimethylphenethylamino)-3-(1-naphthoxy)-2- propanol, was synthesized and found to be a potent beta-adrenergic blocking agent. The beta-adrenergic receptors of cultured rat C6 glioma cells (2B clone) as assessed by [(125)I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding were decreased 50 and >95% after pretreatment with 8 nM and 1 muM aminobenzylpropranolol, respectively. Unlike propranolol, aminobenzylpropranolol displayed a prolonged blockade of receptors that was maintained during several hours of washing. [(125)I]Iodohydroxybenzylpindolol saturation binding experiments in cells exposed to aminobenzylpropranolol and subsequently washed indicated that the compound effectively diminished receptor number with no change in the affinity of the remaining receptors for iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. Aminobenzylpropranolol inhibited catecholamine-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation; with increasing blockade, isoproterenol dose-response curves became progressively shifted to the right but the maximal response was unaltered. Aminobenzylpropranolol inhibited the beta-adrenergic contractile response in atria isolated from rats and guinea pigs. Treatment with 0.1 and 10 muM aminobenzylpropranolol produced decreases of 0.5 and 2 orders of magnitude in the contractile potency of isoproterenol. As in glioma cells, aminobenzylpropranolol failed to decrease the maximal response to isoproterenol. The effects of aminobenzylpropranolol persisted during extensive washing of atria (up to 17 hr). Repeated exposures to isoproterenol at concentrations sufficient to produce maximal tension development also failed to alleviate the blockade. The inotropic potency of histamine in guinea pig atria was not affected by aminobenzylpropranolol. These data suggest that catecholamines are capable of eliciting full biological responses in glioma cells and isolated atria even though the great majority of beta-adrenergic receptors are persistently blocked.", 
    "2": "The role of digoxin and the new beta adrenergic blocking agent, timolol, in controlling heart rate at rest and during exercise was investigated in 28 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. Digoxin failed to prevent excessively rapid heart rates during mild to moderate exercise. Increasing digoxin blood levels from a mean of 0.6 to 1.8 ng/ml had no effect on heart rate either at rest or during exercise. The addition of timolol, 20 to 30 mg/day, resulted in a satisfactory and significant attenuation of the rapid heart rates both at rest and during exercise. Heart rates at rest were 91 and 98 beats/min in the patients with low and high digoxin dosage and rose to 135 and 139 beats/min, respectively, during exercise. Timolol reduced the heart rate to 67 at rest and to 92 beats/min during exercise. The effect of beta adrenergic blockade at rest was less pronounced in patients whose initial heart rates were below 90 beats/min. Digoxin alone may not suffice to control excessive heart rate in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The additional beta adrenergic blockade actually normalizes the heart rate response in these patients.", 
    "3": "The systemic bioavailability, elimination half-life (t1/2), and plasma concentration--response relationships of pamatolol, a relatively cardioselective beta adrenoceptor blocker, have been measured in healthy subjects. Pamatolol is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral dosing. Elimination t1/2 ranged from 2.9 to 4.6 hr after oral doses and from 2.2 to 5.6 hr after intravenous doses. There was a clear relationship between log plasma pamatolol concentration and sympathetic blockade assessed by reduction of exercise heart rate. Concentration-response curves were essentially identical after oral and intravenous doses. There is no evidence of a first-pass effect, nor is there any evidence of metabolite activity.", 
    "4": "The levels of cyclic AMP in slices of cerebral cortex and cerebellum from newborn rats were significantly, but transiently, increased by exposure to the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. Isobutylmethyxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, enhanced this effect and permitted its detection in cerebral cortex obtained from the prenatal rat. These results are consistent with the possibilities that functional noradrenergic synapses are formed early in the ontogeny of the CNS, and that norepinephrine may exert cyclic AMP-mediated influences on brain development.", 
    "5": "Ventricular fibrillation is a major mechanism of sudden death. The cellular link between catecholamine activity and the development of serious ventricular arrhythmias may be in the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Cyclic AMP and agents promoting cAMP accumulation allow development of slow responses which, especially in the presence of regional ischaemia, could develop into ventricular fibrillation. The role of beta-antagonist agents in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction is analysed in relation to the hypothesis linking cAMP and ventricular fibrillation. Reasons for the limited effectiveness of anti-arrhythmic therapy with beta-antagonist agents are given.", 
    "6": "Three agents with known or suspected antidepressant activity, imipramine, salbutamol and dexamphetamine, were active in animal tests predictive of an antidepressant effect in man: antagonism of the hypothermia induced by reserpine, by oxotremorine or by a high dose of apomorphine, and the potentiation of the yohimbine-induced toxicity. These effects were antagonized by d,1-propranolol, suggesting that the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors could be a common mechanism underlying their effects. These results agree with the noradrenergic hypothesis of the pathophysiology of affective disorders.", 
    "7": "Sotalol is a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug without membrane stabilizing activity, without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and with a low cardio-depressive effect. This beta-blocking agent has an half-life much longer than the other beta-blockers (T 1/2 from 10 to 13 hours). The antihypertensive effect and tolerance of 160 mg tablets of sotalol were studied in 35 hypertensive patients aged 18 to 60 years. The drug was administred once daily in the morning. Sotalol prescribed as the only antihypertensive drug lowered the blood pressure to normal values in 21 cases with a single daily of 1 to 3 tablets. In 8 patients a partial response was obtained (25 % reduction of the initial systolic and diatolic pressure). Six patients did not respond. The clinical and biological tolerances were good; Sotalol was only discontinued in three cases. Sotalol appears to be an effective and well tolerated antihypertensive agent, specially for the treatment of moderate and recent essential hypertension in young patients.", 
    "8": "In this study the anti-arrhythmic effectiveness of pindolol has been tested on ventricular effort arrhythmias in a group of 22 cardiopathic patients. The drug, administered for a week at the dose of 5 mg three times a day, obtained positive results due to its beta-blocking action and its intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "9": "The effects of l-propranolol, d-propranolol and clonidine on homovanillic acid (HVA) concentrations in the corpus striatum and nucleus accumbens of rats were studied under normal conditions and after treatment with oxotremorine or haloperidol. Thile propranolol and clonidine given alone had no significant effect on HVA levels in either area, l-propranolol (1--10 mg/kg) and clonidine (0.1 mg/kg), both significantly inhibited the elevation of striatal HVA, found 60 min after oxotremorine administration. Both l- and d-propranolol (2.5 mg/kg), reduced the effect of oxotremorine in the nucleus accumbens. Neither l-propranolol no clonidine affected the rise in HVA in either brain area seen after haloperidol. Our results suggest that propranolol may reduce cholinergic activation of dopaminergic pathways by two different mechanisms. One is stereospecific for the l-isomer and operates in the striatum and another, which is shared by both isomers, occurs in the nucleus accumbens.", 
    "10": "Neurotransmitter receptor binding of 5 ligands was examined in the striatum, substantia nigra (SN) and frontal cortex of rats which had received either unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway (NSP) or unilateral kainic acid lesions of the striatum. 6-OHDA lesions of the NSP significantly reduced [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) and [3H]naloxone ([3H]Nal) binding by 31% and 28% respectively, in the denervated striatum compared to the contralateral side. Scatchard analysis revealed that the alteration in [3H]DHA binding was not due to a change in the affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptor for [3H]DHA. In marked contrast to these changes in the striatum, destruction of the NSP resulted in a significant increase in [3H]DHA and [3H]Nal binding by 44% and 26%, respectively, in the frontal cortex of the lesioned compared to the control side. 6-OHDA lesions in the NSP did not alter striatal receptor binding for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB), [3H]muscimol ([3H]Mus) or [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]Flu). Similarily, intrastriatal kainic acid injections did not alter striatal receptor binding for [3H]Nal, [3H]Flu or [3H]Mus. Of the various receptor densities measured in the SN after the above lesions the only alteration observed was a 43% increase in [3H]Flu binding following 6-OHDA lesions of the NSP. Scatchard analysis indicated no change in the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for [3H]Flu. 6-OHDA lesions of the NSP did not alter [13H]QNB or [3H]Nal binding in the SN. Striatal kainic acid lesions did not alter nigral [3H]QNB or [3H]Flu binding. The results are discussed in terms of neurotransmitter localization and plasticity within the striatum, SN and frontal cortex.", 
    "11": "Adrenergic modification of membrane protein phosphorylation was studied in intact human erythrocytes. Micromolar norepinephrine increased 32P incorporation into Band 2 by 70%, and into Band 3 by 40%. Phosphorylation levels observed with a series of specific agonists and antagonists suggest that an alpha-adrenergic receptor is involved in this effect. The mechanism of linkage between this receptor and protein phosphorylation does not appear to involve modulation of intracellular concentrations of ATP, cyclic AMP, or cyclic GMP.", 
    "12": "Lisuride hydrogen maleate is identified as a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist using a hormone-sensitive adenylate cyclase system and [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding in cell free homogenates of rabbit cerebellum. Lisuride and two other ergolines, lergotrile and bromocriptine, and the phenothiazine, fluphenazine, all interact with spiroperidol binding sites (dopamine receptors) in the anterior pituitary; however, among these compounds lisuride is unique in its ability to antagonize the beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "13": "In vitro incubation of rat cerebral cortex slices with antidepressant drugs reduced beta-adrenergic receptor binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol by 30%. The decrease was maximum after 60 min, and was reversible after 120 min. (-)-Isoproterenol incubation caused a rapid and reversible loss (60%) of beta-receptor binding. Both effects were due to a decrease in beta-receptor sites. In vitro beta-receptor subsensitivity due to desipramine and isoproterenol was non-additive. The observed reversible loss of beta-receptor sites may be an initial phase of the beta-receptor down-regulation by antidepressants seen in vivo.", 
    "14": "Development of cardiac hypertrophy is associated with depletion of endogenous catecholamine stores and increased inotropic response to exogenous catecholamines. A biochemical basis for these changes is provided by the observation that the number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors - as reflected in specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding - is increased in hypertrophy without a change in the affinity of dihydroalprenolol for the binding sites or in the capacity of isoproterenol to displace dihydroalprenolol. This change in beta-receptor numbers may be an important adaptive mechanism for preserving the contractile performance of the hypertrophied myocardium.", 
    "15": "The plasma immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) response to hypoxia was studied in puppies. Three groups of paired experiments were performed. In group I, 8% O2:92% N2 ventilation (PaO2 20--30 torr) produced a rise in plasma IRG and glucose as well as hypotension and bradycardia. However, when group I was air ventilated (PaO2 greater than 70 torr) and given glucose infusions producing hyperglycemia of similar degree, plasma IRG was unchanged. Group II received alpha-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine). When made hypoxic, group II developed no significant IRG rise and less hyperglycemia than with hypoxia alone. Hypotension was more severe with hypoxia plus alpha-blockade. Phenoxybenzamine itself did not change plasma IRG or glucose during air breathing. Group III receivi developed hyperglucagonemia and hyperglycemia not significantly different from that with hypoxia alone. However, hypoxia-caused hypotension and bradycardia was more pronounced with beta-blockade. No change in plasma IRG or glucose occurred in group III animals breathing air. These data suggest that a) glucagon release is caused by acute oxygen deficiency, and b) the hypoxic response is largely adrenergically mediated with the major role played by the alpha-receptor.", 
    "16": "The clinical and haemodynamic features of obstructive cardiomyopathy with hypertrophic subaortic stenosis in a 12-yr-old boy are examined. A cardiac souffle had been present for 10 yr and precordial pain, cardiopalmus and effort dyspnoea for 5-6 yr. Familial association, ischaemic and pseudonecrotic ECG changes, and signs of left ventricle hypertrophy were noted. Left catheterisation and ventriculography showed obstructive hypertrophy of the muscle, two chambers with filling at 160/10 and ejection at 120/10, and slight regurgitation into the left trium. Treatment with 0.2-0.5 mg/kg/day propranolol.", 
    "17": "Diazoxide, clonidine and labetalol, administered intravenously in fixed doses, were used to treat 30 episodes of severe hypertension in 27 patients. Labetalol in a fixed dose of 100 mg proved ineffective treatment. Diazoxide 300 mg and clonidine 300 micrograms were comparable in effectiveness. Drowsiness was a common side effect with administration of clonidine (in six of 10 patients) and severe hypotension occurred in one patient who was given diazoxide.", 
    "18": "Angiotensin I is known to have direct agonist activity at some target tissues, independent of its conversion to angiotensin II. Aspects of its possible direct role as a pressor agent were investigated in conscious rabbits. Phentolamine (3 mg/kg i.v.), a dose which did not affect baseline blood pressure, reduced the pressor response to angiotensin II by 17% (P less than 0.05) but did not alter the sensitivity to angiotensin I. Noradrenaline activity was reduced by 56%. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.), a dose which did not affect baseline blood pressure but which substantially reduced the depressor response to isoprenaline, had no effect on the pressor activity of either angiotensin I or II. Noradrenaline potency was reduced by 32%. Hexamethonium (20 mg/kg i.v.), caused a potentiation of the response to angiotensin I and II and noradrenaline. This was probably a non-specific action associated with the decrease in baseline blood pressure. No differential effect of ganglion blockade on the two angiotensins was noted. The dissociation of the effects of phentolamine on angiotensins I and II provides further evidence that pressor actions of these two compounds act through partially different mechanisms.", 
    "19": "In 22 open-angle glaucoma patients a total of 39 eyes were treated with Timolol 0.25% twice daily for an average period of 12.6 months. The relative intraocular pressure decrease at the beginning of the study was 47% of the untreated pressure level. This initial response declined to a 23% pressure decrease at the end of the study. In 8 eyes treatment had to be discontinued because of insufficient pressure control and in one patient because of subjective intolerance. In two patients (4 eyes) a complete loss of response of Timolol therapy was observed. The phenomenon of slowly diminishing drug effectiveness was not related to the untreated pressure levels in the patients covered by this study. In 5 eyes there was evidence of a rebound effect after discontinuation of Timolol therapy.", 
    "20": "The effect of the beta-adrenoblocker propranolol on adrenaline-stimulated lipolysis was studied in the adipose tissue of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control rats. The lipolytic activity was estimated from the increase in glycerol concentration in the incubation medium in vitro. The adipose tissue of SHR responded to adrenaline similarly to that of control rats, but the concentration of adrenaline inducing the half-maximum response (KA) was 2 times less for SHR than KA for normotensive controls. Under propranolol effect this parameter was increased more significantly in SHR than in controls. These data indicate higher sensitivity of SHR adipose tissue to propranolol that may well be relative to alteration of the properties of beta-adrenergic receptors of adipose tissue in this form of hypertension.", 
    "21": "Hypotension was induced with halothane and labetalol, an alpha and beta adrenergic blocking agent, in nine children undergoing operation for postductal coarctation of the aorta. The mean arterial pressure decreased by an average of 30% following labetalol, and in six patients the initial halothane concentration (1%) had to be reduced during this period. The heart rate decreased by an average of 8% after labetalol. Profound beta-blockade did not occur, and operating conditions were considered satisfactory. The usefulness of labetalol in the postoperative period is suggested.", 
    "22": "Incubating birds regulate the egg temperature by varying their posture and the distance between eggs and brood patch. In the present study, we show that this homeostatic process is further assisted by varying the brood patch blood flow according to the temperature of the eggs. When female ptarmigan resume incubation of cooled eggs (e.g. after a period of foraging), they immediately develop pronounced tachycardia (4 times noraml in wild, 2-3 times in captive birds). Tachycardia is maintained, although at decreasing intensity, until the eggs have obtained normal temperature. The eggs are heated 30 to 50% slower in females where tachycardia is inhibited by a beta-receptor blocking agent.", 
    "23": "Forty-three patients suffering from hypertension of different origin (chronic renal failure, gout, or idiopathic) were treated with propranolol (121 +/- 12 mg q.d.) plus hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg q.d.) for 75 +/- 9 days. Blood pressure did not return to normal limits in 15 patients, who were continued on the same protocol plus 10 to 50 mg oxdralazine q.d. After an average of 68 +/- 35 days blood pressure fell from 180/110 mm Hg to 145/90 mm Hg without orthostatism, significant side effects, or changes in GFR. This combination seems particularly successful since propranolol will prevent the undesired rise in cardiac output due to oxdralazine as well as the activation of the renin-angiotensin axis due to diuretics. Thus, the antihypertensive properties of each agent will be enhanced by a reduction in side effects by the associated drug, resulting in optimal blood pressure control.", 
    "24": "The antiarrhythmic activity of propranolol analogues, the inotropic activity of propranolol analogues, the anti-inflammatory activity of anthranilic acids, the hypnotic activity of barbiturates, and the inhibition of cell division by barbiturates were correlated with either octanol--water partition coefficients or with high-pressure liquid chromatographic retention indices. The retention index, which was a scale based on the relative retention of the drug and a series of C3--C23 2-ketoalkanes, was found to give higher correlations with biological activity than was found between octanol--water partition coefficients and biological activity. Only in the case of the anthranilic acids was the retention index found to give the lower correlation.", 
    "25": "Porcine relaxin (250 guinea-pig units/mg) infused intravenously into anaesthetized rats at 20 micrograms/h reversibly abolished spontaneous intra-uterine pressure cycles yet left the myometrium responsive to oxytocin in doses of 4--8 mu. The inhibition was found to be primarily of the frequency, rather than of the amplitude, of pressure cycles. Relaxin (5 or 10 micrograms) was capable of completely suppressing uterine activity driven by prostaglandin F2 alpha infusion in oestrogen-treated ovariectomized rats. Whereas the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, had no effect on relaxin-induced inhibition, phentolamine, an alpha-blocker, significantly delayed the relaxin effect. It is unlikely, however, that relaxin operates through an alpha-inhibitory receptor. The results show that relaxin acts primarily as a frequency modulator and is capable of antagonizing an exogenous myometrial stimulant.", 
    "26": "The influence of food intake on the bioavailability of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol was assessed by measurement of its single-dose kinetics in ten healthy volunteers, who took 100 mg both in the fasting state and together with a standardized breakfast. Food intake significantly shortened the time to reach peak concentration (2.7 h vs 1.5 h), but caused a significant reduction in AUC values, the mean decrease being 20%. The elimination half-life was unaffected. Atenolol, which is relatively hydrophilic, is incompletely absorbed in the fasting state, and escapes first-pass metabolism. The present findings indicate that food intake causes further impairment of its absorption, even though the absorption rate may initially be enhanced. This contrasts with previous observations on the more lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers propranolol and metoprolol.", 
    "27": "Arterial blood pressure and plasma catecholamines, renin activity and aldosterone concentration in 12 patients with severe essential hypertension were studied before and after combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blockage induced by oral labetalol treatment for 2 months. Furosemide in a fixed dose was employed as a basic antihypertensive agent throughout the study. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in only 6 patients. Mean body weight increased by 1.8 kg and there was a rise in body weight which was inversely correlated with the fall in standing mean blood pressure. The mean plasma noradrenaline concentration decreased from 0.30 to 0.20 ng/ml, whereas plasma adrenaline did not change significantly. Plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration varied greatly, but the mean values did not change significantly. Change in body weight was correlated inversely with changes in plasma noradrenaline and renin. The results suggest that labetalol, through its combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocking action, induces a rise in body weight, probably due to sodium and fluid retention, which partly counterbalances the antihypertensive effect of labetalol, and partly modifies both renin and sympathetic nervous activity.", 
    "28": "The influence of intravenous labetalol and propranolol on the blood pressure response to isometric and dynamic exercise was examined in a double blind study in eight, young, normotensive volunteers. Effects were recorded after propranolol 7.5, 15 and 30 mg i. v., and after labetalol 30, 60 and 120 mg i. v. In control experiments saline was administered. Mean blood pressure rose with successive handgrip tests following saline and propranolol, but not after labetalol, and the difference was significant. The total dose of each drug produced the same reduction in heart rate during sub-maximal bicycle exercise. The exercise-induced systolic blood pressure response did not differ between the drugs.", 
    "29": "1. The effect of a single oral dose of propranolol on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia has been studied in five healthy subjects. 2. Propranolol produced a small but significant reduction in the slope of the ventilation/end-tidal PCO2 regression line. 3. Propranolol did not significantly change vital capacity or forced expiratory volume in 1 s.", 
    "30": "The effects of inotropic stimulation and increases in end-diastolic diameter, aortic pressure, left ventricular end diameter size, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate on maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax) and diameter (dD/dtmax) were studied in eight dogs. Responses were studied in the normal conscious state, during myocardial depression due to high doses of pentobarbital or propranolol, and after bilateral cardiac sympathectomy. In all states studied, both dP/dtmax and dD/dtmax were substantially augmented by inotropic stimulation with isoprenaline and were less influenced by changes in end-diastolic diameter, mean arterial pressure and heart rate. It is concluded that both indices are highly sensitive to the contractile state of the left ventricle and relatively insensitive to haemodynamic alterations in both normal and depressed hearts.", 
    "31": "A 4-year-old boy with the Ullrich-Noonan syndrome is described. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy was diagnosed by echocardiography and confirmed at cardiac catheterisation. The aortic subvalvar gradient was reduced from 56 mmHg to 10 mmHg with intravenous propranolol. Relatives of patients with the syndrome should be screened by echocardiography in the hope that the early detection of asymmetric septal hypertrophy and its treatment with propranolol may reduce the likelihood of sudden death.", 
    "32": "The varied effects of intradermal injection of isoproterenol and propranolol on the immediate skin reaction were studied in relation to the metabolic responses to the intravenous injection of epinephrine. In asthmatic patients whose skin reaction was not suppressed with 10(-7) M isoproterenol, the hyperglycemic response after the injection of epinephrine was significantly reduced.", 
    "33": "The relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics was studied in dogs using sotalol as a model. The t 1/2 of this drug (4.30 +/- 0.40 hr) in dogs was longer than that of other beta adrenergic blockers. The renal clearance of the drug (4.21 +/- 0.31 ml/min/kg) was approximately 90% of total plasma clearance together with an extensive fraction excreted unchanged (72 +/- 12% of dose) in urine. Significant beta blockade, assessed by the response to isoproterenol tachycardia, was observed without change in blood pressure during the experiments. The log plasma sotalol concentration correlated significantly with the beta blockade (P less than .001). In an attempt to obtain insight into drug concentration-effect-time data, we applied a theory for correlating the observed kinetic data with the pharmacological effects using the elimination rate constant (beta) and the slope of log concentration-effect relationship (m). The rate of decline of drug effects (Rd) derived from this application agreed well with that actually observed in the effect-time interrelations.", 
    "34": "The effects of imipramine on sinoatrial rate and chronotropic responses to transmural stimulation (TS) were studied in the isolated guinea-pig right atrial preparation. The negative chronotropic response (cholinergically mediated rate decrease) to TS was progressively inhibited by imipramine (5 x 10(-6) M). This inhibition can be attributed directly to an \"atropine-like\" effect of this drug. The positive chronotropic response (adrenergically mediated rate increase) to TS was markedly potentiated by imipramine at similar therapeutic doses; higher doses (5 x 10(-5) M) substantially depressed this rate response. This depression of the adrenergic response to TS does not appear to be the result of a blockade of beta adrenergic receptors since imipramine still potentiated the rate increase in response to exogenous norepinephrine at doses where no TS response remained. Basal spontaneous rate was also depressed by imipramine at high doses (5 x 10(-5) M), both in the absence and presence of autonomic blockers.", 
    "35": "Muscle biopsies from the vastus muscle were taken at rest and immediately after upright bicycle exercise at 50% of the individual VO2max, before and during 6 wk of alprenolol treatment (200 to 400 mg twice daily) in 6 untrained patients with essential hypertension. Resting muscle concentrations (mmole - kg-1 - wet weight) of glycogen, glucose, lactate, and high-energy phosphates [adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP)] were not affected by alprenolol treatment, but after 10 min after exercise the glycogenolysis increased and depletion of ATP and CP was enhanced. The relationship between blood and muscle lactate was altered by alprenolol, indicating that alprenolol prevents lactate translocation from the muscle to the blood. The results show that during moderate exercise, leg muscle metabolism is influenced by long-term antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "36": "Eleven patients with essential hypertension were treated with the beta adrenergic blocker, acebutolol. Clinical, systemic, and regional hemodynamic and biochemical studies were performed before and after 4 wk of acebutolol therapy (average doses, 1,200 mg/day.) In 4 patients there was a reduction in mean arterial pressure greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg; there was none in the remainder. Regardless of the blood pressure response, the renin secretory index did not change. Although cardiac output did not change, renal blood flow fell (p less than 0.005) without relation to response of arterial pressure. Supine heart rate decreased (p less than 0.05), so also the responses to upright tilt (p less than 0.01) and isometric exercise (p less than 0.02). These results demonstrate that in those patients with a hypotensive response to acebutolol, the clinical effect was not related to reduced cardiac output or plasma renin activity, further adding to confusion on the mechanism of the lowering of elevated blood pressure by beta adrenergic blockade.", 
    "37": "Twenty patients with mild to moderate hypertension whose blood pressures were not adequately controlled by a thiazide diuretic were treated for 4 wk with metropolol. Normotension (diastolic pressure less than 90 mm Hg) or reduction in diastolic pressure of at least 10 mm Hg was achieved in 12 of the patients 1 wk after metoprolol (200 mg/day) was added to the hydrochlorothiazide (100 mg/day) regimen. In the other 8 patients, pressure reduction was attained with larger doses (300 to 400 mg/day) of metoprolol. After 1 wk of combined therapy, heart rate decreased by 11% (p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (PRA) decreased 48% (p less than 0.001). The individual changes in mean blood pressure did not correlate with either the premetoprolol PRA level (r = 0.14) or the changes in PRA after metoprolol (r = 0.03) but did correlate with steady-state metoprolol plasma levels (r = 0.61, p less than 0.01). Pressure and heart rate reductions were sustained during the last 3 wk of combined therapy but the PRA decrease did not persist; levels gradually rose to near control by the fourth week. Urinary sodium excretion was not consistently changed on metoprolol therapy.", 
    "38": "Seven patients had chronic, unexplained, nonparoxysmal sinus tachycardia. The clinical, electrocardiographic, and electrophysiologic characteristics of these cases are described. In each case electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic observations suggested that tachycardia was nonparoxysmal and due to increased automaticity of the sinus node (or of an automatic atrial focus located very near the sinus node). The mechanisms of increased sinus node automaticity in these patients were explored using drugs affecting the autonomic nervous system. In each patient these studies suggested a defect in either sympathetic or vagal nerve control of resting heart rate, with or without an abnormality of intrinsic heart rate. Data are also presented on baroreceptor reflex arc function in these patients.", 
    "39": "The hemodynamic effects of the cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol, at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight administered intravenously, were studied in 10 patients undergoing routine cardiac catheterization. The beta adrenergic blocking effect of the drug was confirmed by a highly significant reduction (53 percent, P less than 0.001) in the mean heart rate response to a challenge with isoproterenol, and by a mean heart rate rssponse to a challenge with isoproterenol, and by a highly significant reduction (73 percent, P less than 0.001) in the isoproterenol-induced increase in the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt). An intrinsic negative inotropic effect was shown by a 43 percent reduction (P less than 0.05) in the response of mean left ventricular dP/dt when the heart rate was fixed by atrial pacing alone. With the combination of atrial pacing and isoproterenol, metoprolol produced a 48 percent reduction (P less than 0.01) in the response of mean left ventricular dP/dt, resulting from both the intrinsic depressor effect and the beta adrenergic blocking effect on the rate-independent beta agonist activity of isoproterenol. There was no significant change in right atrial, femoral arterial or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure; analysis of left ventricular angiograms performed during atrial pacing before and after metoprolol revealed no significant effect on angiographic ejection fraction, pressure-volume loops or diastolic compliance. In two patients improvement in segmental wall motion was noted, and no deterioration was seen in any patient. Metoprolol is an effective cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent that, under these conditions, reduces catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate and left ventricular dP/dt without significant alteration in ejection fraction, preload or afterload.", 
    "40": "Hemodynamic response to exercise before and 10 minutes after propranolol (5 mg intravenously) was studied in 10 young patients with pure mitral stenosis who had normal sinus rhythm and no cardiac failure. After propranolol the mean heart rate and cardiac index at rest were lower than during the control state (respectively, 95 +/- 4 versus 82 +/- 3 beats/min, P less than 0.005; 3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 2.8 +/- 0.1 liters/min per m2, P less than 0.025). As a result, the mean pulmonary wedge pressure and mean mitral valve gradient at rest were lower (respectively, 22 +/- 2 versus 18 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.005; 24 +/- 2 versus 17 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). During exercise after propranolol the values of pulmonary wedge pressure and mitral valve gradient were lower than control values during exercise (respectively, 39 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.005; 44 +/- 3 versus 32 +/- 3 mm Hg, P less than 0.005), again because of the lower heart rate and cardiac index (130 +/- 6 versus 104 +/- 6 beats/min, P less than 0.001; 4.6 +/- 3 versus 3.7 +/- 2 liters/min per m2, P less than 0.01). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and stroke index showed no significant changes. Thus, propranolol may benefit patients with pure mitral stenosis with sinus rhythm and no cardiac failure whose symptoms occur during those reversible conditions characterized by an increase in heart rate or cardiac output, or both.", 
    "41": "The effects of the beta-adernergic blocking drug acebutolol were studied in 23 patients with angina pectoris and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Patients were evaluated clinically, by graded treadmill testing and by 24-hour Holter monitoring in the control state, after 2 weeks treatment with placebo, and after 2 weeks treatment with 600 mg. and then 1,200 mg. of acebutolol. Acebutolol (in a daily dose of 600 mg.) was an effective antianginal drug: the number of clinical attacks of angina pectoris (p less than 0.001) and the consumption of sublingual nitrate decreased (p less than 0.01), there was a significant increase in the treadmill effort tolerance as measured by the time to appearance of ischemic ECG changes (p less than 0.001) and the total work performed (p less than 0.001), and there was also a significant decrease in ischemic ST segment depression on 24-hour Holter monitoring. Treatment with 1,200 mg. acebutolol was associated with a further decrease in heart rate and a further improvement in effort tolerance on treadmill testing (p less than 0.05). On the large dose of the drug, however, there was no further clinical improvement, and no further improvement on 24-hour ECG monitoring; several patients complained of weakness and fatigue. Graded treadmill testing was an excellent objective method for assessing physical effort tolerance and its improvement after treatment with the beta-blocking drug. Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring was a useful and complementary test, especially in patients who stopped exercising on the treadmill because of fatigue or weakness, and especially for assessing the efficacy of beta-blockade in controlling emotionally induced tachycardia and ischemia in the patient's own daily environment.", 
    "42": "Disopyramide resembles quinidine electrophysiologically, but its effect on left ventricular function has not been clarified. Twelve awake dogs were instrumented for measurement of cardiac output, left ventricular pressure and its maximal first derivative (dP/dt max), and left atrial and aortic pressures. Disopyramide or quinidine at identical, clinically relevant doses (1 and 5 mg/kg i.v.) was infused over 5 minutes at each level. Peak changes after disopyramide 1 mg/kg included increases in heart rate (34%), mean aortic pressure (24%) and systemic vascular resistance (33%), and decreases in stroke volume (16%) and dP/dt max (19%). With disopyramide at 5 mg/kg these changes were of greater magnitude (e.g., dP/dt -- 36%). Quinidine at both doses caused no changes except a 13% decrease in vascular resistance at 5 mg/kg. Heart rate with disopyramide increased after propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.), was unchanged after atropine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), and slowed after propranolol and atropine. Phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg i.v.) did not prevent the rise in systemic vascular resistance produced by disopyramide. Thus, disopyramide in clinical dosages exerts opposing direct and indirect effects on cardiac pacemakers and, unlike quinidine, is a potent myocardial depressant and vasoconstrictor in the conscious dog.", 
    "43": "In a study lasting 16 months, Timolol was tested on 57 eyes of a group of selected patients with open-angle glaucoma. Patients whose IOP could not be stabilized with the 0.25% solution were treated with 0.5% drops twice a day. In five separate cases, where regulation was inadequate, pilocarpine 2% twice a day was prescribed in addition. At the end of 16 months' treatment pressure had been lowered to a statistically highly significant degree in 66% of the patients. While the degree of regulation in the remainder was not statistically sifnificant, most of them were adequately stabilized. Further, following stabilization with Timolol, 42% of the patients were subjected to tolerance tests under constant conditions (darkness test, water test, coffee and tea tolerance) and their 6.00 a.m.values were measured. While good pressure levels were recorded in the tolerance tests, the early-morning IOP rose to critical threshold levels in some patients. However, during the entire period of observation visual fields and optic disk findings remained unaltered in all cases. Only a few cases were subjective and/or objective side-effects seen. Ten percent of those patients who had been treated previously required new glasses (+0,5 to +1 D over the previous correction).", 
    "44": "103 patients with arterial hypertension were treated with timolol + placebo for 7 weeks in a multicentre trial, and with timolol + hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride for a further 7-week period. The decrease in blood pressure (BP) produced by timolol alone was influenced neither by the dose of timolol, initial heart rate, magnitude of pretreatment BP nor by age. 64% of the patients less than 40 years of ages, and 48% of the older patients, were well regulated on beta-blocker monotherapy. When the diuretic was given in addition, the BP response in the older age group improved, whereas younger patients showed no change. A significant correlation was found between age or magnitude of untreated BP and the decrease in BP caused by the diuretic. The cardiothoracic ratio increased significantly on timolol alone, whereas no change was found on the combined therapy. Weight changes in the two different treatment periods showed a significant correlation, but they were not related to the observed reduction in BP. The results suggest that in younger patients, beta-blocker therapy is just as effective as a combined treatment with a diuretic, whereas in older patients considerably better regulation is achieved by combined therapy.", 
    "45": "In 60 patients with mitral valve prolapse syndrome a randomized controlled interindividual double-blind study of propranolol (p) was performed. Patients received p 80 mg (A), 160 mg (B) and placebo (C) orally for 4 weeks. Prior to and after treatment, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (RR) as well as systolic time intervals (STI) were measured and corrected for heart rate--electromechanical systole (QS2I), left ventricular ejection time (LVETI), and preejection period (PEPI). The ratio PEP/LVET was calculated. Plasma levels were measured by an optimized fluorimetric method. 1. STI lay in the upper part of the normal range, indicating that some patients had a hyperkinetic cardiac function. 2. P had no influence on QS2I and LVETI in A and B. PEPI was prolonged (A: +13.2 ms, B: +14.2 ms) and PEP/LVET was increased (A: +0.040, B: +0.050). 3. As indicated by the changes in HR, RR, PEPI, and PEP/LVET p showed in B compared to A only minor additional effects. 4. Plasma levels of p were in B three times higher than in A (A: 89.2 +/- 10.0 nmol/l B: 246.7 +/- 30.5 nmol/l). With a dose of 80 mg propranolol a point close to the plateau of maximum efficacy was reached, where a higher dose resulted only in small additional negative inotropic effects.", 
    "46": "The effects of 9-aminoacridine and tetraethylammonium on insulin release and rubidium efflux from perifused rat islets were investigated and correlated with their effects on the electrical properties of mouse B cells studied with microelectrode techniques. 9-Aminoacridine (0.05--1 mmol/l) and tetraethylammonium (2--40 mmol/l) produced a dose-dependent, reversible potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin release. This effect was rapid, affected both phases of secretion and was maximum in the presence of 6 mmol/l glucose, but no longer significant at 20 mmol/l glucose. It was unaltered by atropine or propanolol, and abolished by mannoheptulose or omission of extracellular calcium. 9-Aminoacridine, but not tetraethylammonium, also induced insulin release in the absence of glucose stimulation. Neither drug modified glucose metabolism in islet cells and only 9-aminoacridine increased 45Ca2+ uptake. In the presence of 0, 3 or 6 mmol/l glucose, but no longer at 20 mmol/l glucose, 9-aminoacridine and tetraethylammonium reduced the rate of 86Rb+ efflux from the islets. Both drugs also slightly reduced 86Rb+ uptake by islet cells. In the presence of 11 mmol/l glucose, 9-aminoacridine reduced the amplitude and the duration of the polarization phases between the bursts of electrical activity; concomitantly these periods of spike activity were markedly prolonged. At lower glucose concentrations (3 or 7 mmol/l), 9-aminoacridine progressively depolarized B cells and induced electrical activity in otherwise silent cells. Tetraethylammonium also suppressed the repolarization phases between the bursts of spikes in the presence of a stimulating concentration of glucose. At low glucose, tetraethylammonium produced only a limited and not maintained depolarization. These results show that a reduction of the potassium permeability in pancreatic B cells potentiates the insulin-releasing effect of glucose and may even stimulate secretion. They also suggest that the initial depolarizing effect of glucose is due to a reduction of the potassium permeability, whereas the repolarization at the end of each burst of electrical activity is mediated, at least in part, by an increase in the potassium permeability of B cells.", 
    "47": "Lithium inhibits in vitro as well as in vivo several hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclases. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which lithium inhibits adenylate cyclase in vitro. It was found that lithium inhibited both the norepinephrine- and the glucagon-induced cAMP accumulation in rat fat cells at lithium concentrations above 10 mM. The basal cAMP content was unaffected even at 40 mM of lithium. The inhibitory action was time-dependent and reversible, indicating an intracellular site of action. Lithium inhibited both norepinephrine- and glucagon-stimulated cAMP accumulation in a mainly non-competitive way, but the inhibitory effect decreased with increasing hormone concentrations. In accordance, lithium and propranolol had a supraadditive effect on norepinephrine-induced cAMP accumulation. It is suggested that lithium affects both the hormone-receptor binding as well as the transfer of the hormonal stimulus by an intracellular site of action."
