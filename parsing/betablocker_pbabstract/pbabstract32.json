Aimed to better understand the molecular mechanisms of its interactions with cell membranes, human erythrocyte and molecular models of the red cell membrane were utilized. The latter consisted of bilayers of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), representative of phospholipid classes located in the outer and inner monolayers of the human erythrocyte membrane, respectively. The capacity of propranolol to perturb the multibilayer structures of DMPC and DMPE was evaluated by X-ray diffraction. Moreover, we took advantage of the capability of differential scanning calorimetry to detect the changes in the thermotropic phase behavior of lipid bilayers resulting from propranolol interaction with DMPC and DMPE multilamellar vesicles. In an attempt to further elucidate their effects on cell membranes, the present work also examined their influence on the morphology of intact human erythrocytes by means of defocusing and scanning electron microscopy. Results indicated that propranolol induced morphological changes to human erythrocytes and interacted in a concentration-dependent manner with phospholipid bilayer.", 
    "1": "A five-state model of myofilament contraction was integrated into a well-established rabbit ventricular myocyte model of ion channels, Ca(2+) transporters and kinase signaling to analyze the relative contribution of different phosphorylation targets to the overall mechanical response driven by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation (\u03b2-AS). \u03b2-AS effect on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) handling, Ca(2+), K(+) and Cl(-) currents, and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase properties was included based on experimental data. The inotropic effect on the myofilaments was represented as reduced myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (XBCa) and titin stiffness, and increased cross-bridge (XB) cycling rate (XBcy). Assuming independent roles of XBCa and XBcy, the model reproduced experimental \u03b2-AS responses on action potentials and Ca(2+) transient amplitude and kinetics. It also replicated the behavior of force-Ca(2+), release-restretch, length-step, stiffness-frequency and force-velocity relationships, and increased force and shortening in isometric and isotonic twitch contractions. The \u03b2-AS effect was then switched off from individual targets to analyze their relative impact on contractility. Preventing \u03b2-AS effects on L-type Ca(2+) channels or phospholamban limited Ca(2+) transients and contractile responses in parallel, while blocking phospholemman and K(+) channel (IKs) effects enhanced Ca(2+) and inotropy. Removal of \u03b2-AS effects from XBCa enhanced contractile force while decreasing peak Ca(2+) (due to greater Ca(2+) buffering), but had less effect on shortening. Conversely, preventing \u03b2-AS effects on XBcy preserved Ca(2+) transient effects, but blunted inotropy (both isometric force and especially shortening). Removal of titin effects had little impact on contraction. Finally, exclusion of \u03b2-AS from XBCa and XBcy while preserving effects on other targets resulted in preserved peak isometric force response (with slower kinetics) but nearly abolished enhanced shortening. \u03b2-AS effects on XBCa and XBcy have greater impact on isometric and isotonic contraction, respectively.",

Serum and urine levels of amitriptyline dosages are not correlated with severity of toxicity; therefore, it increases the importance of electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities. The prolongation of QTc can be a predictive marker for cardiotoxicity. Hence, in this study, it is aimed to evaluate possible effects of metoprolol and diltiazem in amitriptyline toxicity.", 
    "3": "The rats were separated into four groups. First one was control group, the second was the amitriptyline + saline group, third one was the amitriptyline + metoprolol group, and forth one was the amitriptyline + diltiazem group. ECG were recorded on rats under anesthesia.",

Myocardial infarction, diabetes and beta-blocker therapy were more frequent in positive TaVR patients. Patients with upright TaVR were older, had higher left ventricular mass index, lower ejection fraction, higher calcium \u00d7 phosphate product, higher troponin T level, higher prevalence of ST-T abnormalities, and increased width of QRS complex and QT interval, compared with patients with negative TaVR. A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative incidences of CV mortality as well as SCD were higher in patients with positive TaVR compared with those with negative TaVR (log-rank, p < 0.001 in both cases). A multivariate analysis selected age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.71, p < 0.001], heart rate (HR 1.42, p = 0.016), and positive TaVR (HR 2.21, p = 0.001) as well as age (HR 1.88, p < 0.001), and positive TaVR (HR 1.53, p = 0.014) as independent predictors of CV mortality and SCD, respectively.",

Our analysis studied patients enrolled in the Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry, who underwent coronary revascularization using PCI or CABG in the 12 months before their most recent outpatient visit in 2011. We compared the attainment of CAD performance measures and statin use in eligible patients with PCI and CABG using hierarchical logistic regression models. Our study cohort consisted of 112,969 patients (80,753 with PCI and 32,216 with CABG). After adjustment for site and patient characteristics, performance measure compliance for tobacco use query (odds ratio [OR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.86), antiplatelet therapy (OR 0.9; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.94) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.84 to 0.94) was lower in CABG compared with patients with PCI. Patients who underwent recent CABG had higher rates of \u03b2-blocker (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.33) and statin treatment (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.43) compared with patients with PCI. Of the 79 practice sites, 15 (19%) had \u226575% of their patients with CAD (CABG or PCI) meeting 75% to 100% of all eligible CAD performance measures. In conclusion, gaps persist in compliance with specific CAD performance measures in patients with recent PCI or CABG, and 1 in 5 practices had \u226575% compliance of eligible CAD performance measures in the most of their patients.",

Our aim was to assess propranolol efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients older than 1 year. A retrospective study of patients older than 1 year diagnosed with IH and treated in our vascular anomalies clinic between 2009 and 2013 was performed. Eighteen patients older than 1 year with a diagnosis of IH (15 girls, 3 boys) were identified. The mean age at the time of initiation of treatment was 25.7 months (range 13-72 mos). Single lesions were observed in 13 patients and multiple lesions in 5. Fifteen patients had focal lesions and three had segmental. The median duration of treatment with oral propranolol was 11.8 months (range 2-33 mos). Complete response was observed in 72.2% of the patients and partial response in 27.8%. Recurrence was observed in three patients 4.7 months after completion of therapy (range 0.3-8 mos). These patients required further therapy with propranolol for 6 more months. Bradycardia was documented in two patients and night terrors in one patient, which led to discontinuation of treatment. In our experience, propranolol may be useful in the treatment of IHs beyond the proliferation phase (>1 year old), but more studies are needed to support this observation.",

The mass spectrometer was operated in Full MS/dd-MS(2) (data-dependent MS(2)) mode, under which a Full MS scan was followed by a dd-MS(2) scan with a fragmentation energy. The quantification was achieved using matrix-matched standard calibration curves with salbutamol-d3 and clenbuterol-d9 as the internal standards. The method validation included assessment of selectivity, sensitivity, calibration curve, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and stability. The results show an exceptional linear relationship with the concentrations of the analytes over wide concentration ranges (e.g., 0.01-50 \u03bcg/kg for clenbuterol) as all the fitting coefficients of determination r(2) are >0.9986. The detection limits (LODs) were in the range of 0.0033-0.01 \u03bcg/kg, which was much lower than the current reported methods. The recoveries were able to reach 73.0-88.7%, while the matrix effects ranged from 83.7% to 92.8%. Analysis of 400 pork, beef, mutton and chicken samples reveal that only 4.25% samples were positive for \u03b22-agonists. The detected \u03b22-agonists involved salbutamol, clenbuterol, ractopamine and clorprenaline. Overall, the novel Q-Orbitrap technique was demonstrated to have great performance for the screening, identification and quantification of ultra-trace \u03b22-agonists used in food animal muscles, which helps to ensure food safety and public health.",

Patients routinely prescribed beta-blockers underwent a first CPET on medication. Beta-blockers were stopped for one week before a second CPET. Patients not routinely taking beta-blockers underwent the first CPET off treatment, then performed a second CPET after commencement of bisoprolol for at least 48 h. Oxygen uptake (.VO2) at estimated lactate threshold and .VO2 at peak were primary outcome variables.

    "24": "Severe aortic regurgitation was induced by retrograde puncture of the aortic valve leaflets under sonographic guidance in 12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Four weeks after regurgitation, the mice were treated with carvedilol (30 mg/kg/d) or not treated (control). Before and 4 weeks after carvedilol treatment, the coronary flow reserve and LV structure and function were evaluated by echocardiography. Cardiomyocytes and fibrosis were validated by histologic analysis.", 
    "25": "Four-week aortic regurgitation caused a decreased LV ejection fraction and an increased LV end-systolic volume index. Regurgitation also impaired the coronary flow reserve due to an increase in the basal coronary peak diastolic velocity and velocity-time integral combined with the absence of substantial changes in the hyperemic coronary peak diastolic velocity and velocity-time integral. Four more weeks of regurgitation further deteriorated LV remodeling and coronary perfusion in the control group. In contrast, the carvedilol-treated group showed attenuated LV remodeling and a higher coronary flow reserve by decreasing the basal peak diastolic velocity and velocity-time integral without substantial changes in the hyperemic peak diastolic velocity and velocity-time integral. The coronary flow reserve and its pretreatment versus posttreatment difference were positively correlated with the pretreatment versus posttreatment LV ejection fraction and end-systolic volume index differences. In the carvedilol-treated group, subendocardial fibrosis was significantly reduced (P < .05), and the cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area tended to be smaller.",

He had an extensive past medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2 and chronic kidney disease stage III. Prior to admission, the patient was taking carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily with no abnormality in his serum potassium. During hospitalization, his carvedilol was increased to 6.25 mg twice daily. The patient's serum potassium then rose from 4.8 to 6.7 mEq/L, with no improvement following administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Nephrology concluded the carvedilol could be contributing to the hyperkalemia. The dose was decreased back to 3.125 mg twice daily, leading to the potassium normalizing to 4.4 mEq/L. The reported incidence of beta-blocker-induced hyperkalemia is less than 5%. A literature search revealed several cases of beta-blocker-induced hyperkalemia, but to the authors' knowledge, this is the first case describing carvedilol specifically. Utilization of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible probability that the carvediol was the cause.",

    "32": "One quarter of deaths associated with Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, are sudden and unexpected. RTT is associated with prolonged QTc interval (LQT), and LQT-associated cardiac arrhythmias are a potential cause of unexpected death. The standard of care for LQT in RTT is treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists; however, recent work indicates that acute treatment of mice with RTT with a \u03b2-antagonist, propranolol, does not prevent lethal arrhythmias. In contrast, acute treatment with the Na(+) channel blocker phenytoin prevented arrhythmias. Chronic dosing of propranolol may be required for efficacy; therefore, we tested the efficacy of chronic treatment with either propranolol or phenytoin on RTT mice. Phenytoin completely abolished arrhythmias, whereas propranolol showed no benefit. Surprisingly, phenytoin also normalized weight and activity, but worsened breathing patterns. To explore the role of Na(+) channel blockers on QT in people with RTT, we performed a retrospective analysis of QT status before and after Na(+) channel blocker antiepileptic therapies. Individuals with RTT and LQT significantly improved their QT interval status after being started on Na(+) channel blocker antiepileptic therapies. Thus, Na(+) channel blockers should be considered for the clinical management of LQT in individuals with RTT.",

In this article, we report a case of an infant who was admitted to the Pediatrics and Neonatology Unit of the Moscati Hospital (Aversa, Italy) about 24 hours after birth. The reason for hospitalization was persistent severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose = 30 mg/dL) and jaundice (total bilirubin = 12.5 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 11.75 mg/dL). He was born by spontaneous delivery after a normal term pregnancy. Birth weight was 3040 g and the Apgar score was 6-9.

The cohort study included 6771 patients who received long-term carvedilol treatment between 2000 and 2010 (carvedilol cohort) and 6771 matched controls (noncarvedilol cohort). A Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the risk of cancer in the patients treated with carvedilol.", 
    "55": "With the mean follow-up period of 5.17 years and 4.93 years in the carvedilol and noncarvedilol cohorts, respectively, the patients in the carvedilol cohort had a 26% reduction of cancer risk compared with those in the noncarvedilol cohort (hazard ratio [HR]=0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.63-0.87; p<.001). The sex-specific carvedilol to noncarvedilol relative risk was lower for both women (HR=0.73; 95% CI=0.56-0.94) and men (HR=0.75; 95% CI=0.61-0.92). Moreover, stratified by cancer site, treatment with carvedilol in the carvedilol cohort resulted in significantly lower incidence of stomach and lung cancers than in the noncarvedilol cohort.",

    "57": "Infantile hemangiomas are a common vascular birthmark with heterogeneous presentations and unique growth characteristics with early rapid growth and eventual self-involution. Hemangiomas that develop around the eye have the potential for inducing amblyopia by several mechanisms and may eventually result in permanent visual impairment in otherwise healthy infants. Segmental periocular hemangiomas carry the additional risk of associated structural anomalies and PHACE syndrome. In recent years, the treatment of periocular hemangiomas has been revolutionized by the serendipitous discovery of the effectiveness of beta-blockers (systemic and topical), with most experts viewing these as first-line therapies. The management of periocular hemangiomas should involve a close partnership between an ophthalmologist and dermatologist or other relevant specialists familiar with the unique clinical features, differential diagnosis, treatment approaches, and potential complications.", 
    "58": "Right heart failure may develop from pulmonary arterial hypertension or various forms of congenital heart disease. Right ventricular adaptation to the increased afterload is the most important prognostic factor in pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart disease, which share important pathophysiological mechanisms, despite having different aetiologies. There is substantial evidence of increased sympathetic nervous system activation in right heart failure related to both pulmonary hypertension and congenital heart disease. It is unknown to which degree this activation is an adaptive response, a maladaptive response, or if it mainly reflects disease progression. Several experimental studies and clinical trials have been conducted to answer these questions. Here, we review the existing knowledge on sympathetic nervous system activation and the effects of \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade in experimental and clinical right heart failure. This review identifies important gaps in our understanding of the right ventricle and discusses the potential of \u03b2-blockers in the treatment of right heart failure.", 
    "59": "Recent large epidemiological studies have confirmed that an elevated resting heart rate is an independent predictor of cardiovascular and overall mortality in the general population as well as in patients with hypertension, coronary heart disease and chronic heart failure. Pathophysiological studies indicate that a higher heart rate has detrimental effects that favor myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmias, as well as an increase in vascular oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis progression. Benefits of heart rate lowering drugs, such as beta-blockers and ivabradine, in reducing overall and cardiovascular-related mortality, have been demonstrated particularly in patients with coronary heart disease and heart failure. However, despite these evidences, resting heart rate is still an overlooked cardiovascular risk factor.", 
    "60": "G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is a relatively recently identified non-nuclear estrogen receptor, expressed in several tissues, including brain and blood vessels. The mechanisms elicited by GPER activation in brain microvascular endothelial cells are incompletely understood. The purpose of this work was to assess the effects of GPER activation on cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration, [Ca(2+)](i), nitric oxide production, membrane potential and cell nanomechanics in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVEC). Extracellular but not intracellular administration of G-1, a selective GPER agonist, or extracellular administration of 17-\u03b2-estradiol and tamoxifen, increased [Ca(2+)](i) in RBMVEC. The effect of G-1 on [Ca(2+)](i) was abolished in Ca(2+) -free saline or in the presence of a L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker. G-1 increased nitric oxide production in RBMVEC; the effect was prevented by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. G-1 elicited membrane hyperpolarization that was abolished by the antagonists of small and intermediate-conductance Ca(2+) -activated K(+) channels, apamin, and charibdotoxin. GPER-mediated responses were sensitive to G-36, a GPER antagonist. In addition, atomic force microscopy studies revealed that G-1 increased the modulus of elasticity, indicative of cytoskeletal changes and increase in RBMVEC stiffness. Our results unravel the mechanisms underlying GPER-mediated effects in RBMVEC with implications for the effect of estrogen on cerebral microvasculature. Activation of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMVEC) increases [Ca(2+)](i) by promoting Ca(2+) influx. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) leads to membrane hyperpolarization, nitric oxide (NO) production, and to cytoskeletal changes and increased cell stiffness. Our results unravel the mechanisms underlying GPER-mediated effects in RBMVEC with implications for the effect of estrogen on cerebral microvasculature.", 
    "61": "L-Carnosine is synthesized in mammalian muscles and brain and affects autonomic neurotransmission and physiological phenomena. To clarify the role of l-carnosine, the effects of intraduodenal administration of l-carnosine on muscle sympathetic nerve activity (muscle-SNA) and blood flow (BF) were examined. The changes in muscle-SNA and BF were examined using electrophysiological and Doppler flowmeter in urethane-anesthetized rats. The effect of propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist, on the increase in muscle BF due to l-carnosine was also examined. Low dose (1\u03bcg/300g body weight [bw]) of l-carnosine increased both muscle-SNA and muscle BF, while high dese (100mg/300g bw) of l-carnosine decreased both muscle-SNA and muscle BF. Furthermore, propranolol eliminated the increase in muscle BF caused by a low dose of l-carnosine. These results suggest that l-carnosine has dose-dependent effects on muscle BF via changes in muscle-SNA, and the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor is implicated in the increase in muscle BF due to l-carnosine.",

The inhibition of rDPSC differentiation via LTCC blocker nimodipine and Cav1.2 knockdown through short hairpin RNA was evaluated by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence staining.", 
    "64": "Nimodipine treatment and Cav1.2 knockdown generated similar results. The number of positive calcium nodules and the protein and mRNA levels of dentin sialophosphoprotein were significantly reduced during odontogenic differentiation. The levels of microtubule-associated protein-2 and \u03b2-III-tubulin were reduced in neural differentiation. The expression of DCT decreased after odontogenic differentiation but significantly increased after neural differentiation (P < .05, n = 9).", 
    "65": "Our data showed that LTCC blocker nimodipine inhibits the odontogenic and neural differentiation of rDPSCs, and Cav1.2 is responsible for the activity of LTCC. The expression of DCT of Cav1.2 significantly changes during both odontogenic and neural differentiation. Thus, Cav1.2 of LTCC plays an essential role in differentiation of DPSCs, which might be mediated through the regulation of DCT levels in DPSCs.", 
    "66": "(R,R')-4'-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol [(R,R')-MNF] is a highly-selective \u03b22 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR) agonist. Incubation of a panel of human-derived melanoma cell lines with (R,R')-MNF resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of motility as assessed by in vitro wound healing and xCELLigence migration and invasion assays. Activity of (R,R')-MNF positively correlated with the \u03b22-AR expression levels across tested cell lines. The anti-motility activity of (R,R')-MNF was inhibited by the \u03b22-AR antagonist ICI-118,551 and the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor Ro 20-1724 mimicked the ability of (R,R')-MNF to inhibit migration of melanoma cell lines in culture, highlighting the importance of cAMP for this phenomenon. (R,R')-MNF caused significant inhibition of cell growth in \u03b22-AR-expressing cells as monitored by radiolabeled thymidine incorporation and xCELLigence system. The MEK/ERK cascade functions in cellular proliferation, and constitutive phosphorylation of MEK and ERK at their active sites was significantly reduced upon \u03b22-AR activation with (R,R')-MNF. Protein synthesis was inhibited concomitantly both with increased eEF2 phosphorylation and lower expression of tumor cell regulators, EGF receptors, cyclin A and MMP-9. Taken together, these results identified \u03b22-AR as a novel potential target for melanoma management, and (R,R')-MNF as an efficient trigger of anti-tumorigenic cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling in \u03b22-AR-expressing lesions.",

The tertiary dentinogenesis beneath the prepared cavity was significantly higher in the rats receiving 2-week systemic administration of propranolol than in those without the propranolol treatment. The higher-dose treatment of propranolol (P < .001) presented more effective up-regulation of tertiary dentinogenesis than the lower-dose treatment (P < .01).",

The study involved 100 patients with hypertension 1-3 first degree and CHD, which previous antihypertensive therapy was ineffective or irregular. Inclusion in the treatment regimen of amlodipine was associated with significant decrease in blood pressure (BP) with the achievement of the target level of systolic blood pressure of 90%, diastolic blood pressure--in 97% of cases after 4 weeks treatment. Analysis of the dynamics of the heart rate during the visits to the doctor and the patient diary data revealed a significant slowing on the background of the therapy, which is important for patients with coronary artery disease. In carrying out daily monitoring of ECG Holter dynamics observed a decrease in the average duration of episodes of depression segment ST on 50.5% (p < 0.05) and the number of ischemic episodes at 54.8% (p < 0.05).

    "72": "The effect of the dinucleotide P(1), P(4)-Di (adenosine-5') tetraphosphate (Ap4A) in improving adrenergic anti-glaucomatous delivery by modifying the tight junction proteins of the corneal epithelium was evaluated. Stratified human corneal epithelial cells (HCLE) were treated with Ap4A (100\u00a0\u03bcM) for 5\u00a0min and TJ protein levels and barrier function were analysed by western blotting and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), respectively. Western blot experiments showed a significant\u00a0reduction at 2\u00a0h (45% reduction of ZO-1 and 65% reduction of occludin protein levels) as compared to non-treated (control) cells. Two hours after Ap4A treatment, TEER values were significantly reduced (65% as compared to control levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001)), indicating an increase in corneal barrier permeability. Topical application of Ap4A in New Zealand white rabbits two hours before the instillation of the hypotensor compounds (the \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, brimonidine and the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, timolol), improved the delivery of these compounds to the anterior chamber as well as their hypotensive action on the intraocular pressure. The results obtained showed that, when Ap4A was topically applied two hours before the adrenergic compounds, the concentration of brimonidine in the aqueous humour increased from 64.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0nM to 240.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6\u00a0nM and from 58.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2\u00a0nM to 183.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8\u00a0nM in the case of timolol, which also produces a more profound effect on IOP. Therefore, Ap4A treatment results in a better entrance of adrenergic anti-glaucomatous compounds within the eye and consequently improved therapeutic efficiency by increasing corneal epithelial barrier permeability.", 
    "73": "Statins are inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, thereby inhibiting cell synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids. Moreover, several studies have been evaluating pleiotropic effects of statins, mainly because they present neuroprotective effects in various pathological conditions. However, knowledge about behavioral effects of statins per se is relatively scarce. Considering these facts, we aimed to analyze behavioral responses of atorvastatin or simvastatin-treated mice in the open field test, elevated plus maze and object location test. Atorvastatin treatment for 7 consecutive days at 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (v.o.) or simvastatin 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg enhanced cognitive performance in object location test when compared to control group (saline-treated mice). Simvastatin effects on mice performance in the object location test was abolished by post-training infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Atorvastatin and simvastatin did not change the behavioral response in open field and elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests in any of the used doses. These data demonstrate the positive effects of both statins in cognitive processes in mice, without any alteration in locomotor parameters in the open field test or anxiolytic-like behavior in EPM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that atorvastatin and simvastatin per se improve the cognitive performance in a rodent model of spatial memory and this effect is related to beta-adrenergic receptors modulation.",

Recent research suggests that heart failure is a heterogeneous syndrome and that many patients have stimulating auto-antibodies directed against the second extracellular loop of the \u03b21 adrenergic receptor (\u03b21EC2). In a human-analogous rat model such antibodies cause myocyte damage and heart failure. Here we used this model to test a novel antibody-directed strategy aiming to prevent and/or treat antibody-induced cardiomyopathy. To generate heart failure, we immunised n = 76/114 rats with a fusion protein containing the human \u03b21EC2 (amino-acids 195-225) every 4 weeks; n = 38/114 rats were control-injected with 0.9% NaCl. Intravenous application of a novel cyclic peptide mimicking \u03b21EC2 (\u03b21EC2-CP, 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks) or administration of the \u03b21-blocker bisoprolol (15 mg/kg/day orally) was initiated either 6 weeks (cardiac function still normal, prevention-study, n = 24 (16 treated vs. 8 untreated)) or 8.5 months after the 1st immunisation (onset of cardiomyopathy, therapy-study, n = 52 (40 treated vs. 12 untreated)); n = 8/52 rats from the therapy-study received \u03b21EC2-CP/bisoprolol co-treatment. We found that \u03b21EC2-CP prevented and (alone or as add-on drug) treated antibody-induced cardiac damage in the rat, and that its efficacy was superior to mono-treatment with bisoprolol, a standard drug in heart failure. While bisoprolol mono-therapy was able to stop disease-progression, \u03b21EC2-CP mono-therapy -or as an add-on to bisoprolol- almost fully reversed antibody-induced cardiac damage. The cyclo\u00acpeptide acted both by scavenging free anti-\u03b21EC2-antibodies and by targeting \u03b21EC2-specific memory B-cells involved in antibody-production. Our model provides the basis for the clinical translation of a novel double-acting therapeutic strategy that scavenges harmful anti-\u03b21EC2-antibodies and also selectively depletes memory B-cells involved in the production of such antibodies. Treatment with immuno-modulating cyclopeptides alone or as an add-on to \u03b21-blockade represents a promising new therapeutic option in immune-mediated heart failure.",

(rhamnoside) and its impact on carbohydrate metabolic key enzymes in control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg). Oral administration of rhamnoside for 21 days significantly reduced food intake, calorie intake, blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and improved plasma insulin levels. Administration of rhamnoside showed significant increase in the body weight, body composition (Lean body weight (LBW) and retro body fat), glycolytic hexokinase, glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase levels where as significant decrease was observed in the levels of glucose-6-phosphatase fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase in diabetic treated rats. Further, administration of rhamnoside significantly improved the glycogen content, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, suggesting the antihyperglycemic potential of rhamnoside in diabetic rats. The results obtained were compared with glibenclamide a standard hypoglycaemic drug. Immunohistopathological study of pancreas revealed increased number of \u03b2-cells and insulin granules in diabetes-induced rats after treatment with rhamnoside for 21 days. Furthermore, Co-administration of rhamnoside (50 mg/kg) with nifedipine (13.6 mg/kg), a Ca(2+)ion channel blocker, or nicorandil (6.8 mg/kg), an ATP-sensitive K(+) ion channel opener, reveals the insulin secretion property of rhamnoside via a K(+)-ATP channels dependent pathway in diabetic rats. In conclusion, rhamnoside normalized blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, key hepatic enzymes and glycogen content by increasing insulin secretion via K(+)-ATP channels dependent signaling pathway. The results suggest that the rhamnoside from H. alpina could be used as a therapeutic agent to treat diabetes mellitus.",

Diagnosed with streptococcal pharyngitis, she received antibiotics and dexamethasone, and was discharged. Within 24\u2005h she returned to the ED with signs and symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome; she was thus given \u03b2-blockers. Her coronary angiogram was normal. She developed cardiogenic shock with an ejection fraction (EF) of 10% and apical ballooning on echocardiography. Her condition improved with optimal medical therapy. Subsequent testing weeks later confirmed the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Following prazosin and an adrenalectomy, all her antihypertensive medications were weaned and her EF normalised. We believe the high-dose exogenous corticosteroids triggered a pheochromocytoma crisis. The concomitant use of \u03b2-blockers without preceding \u03b1 blockade resulted in cardiovascular collapse. Pheochromocytoma crisis must be included in the differential diagnosis of any dramatic haemodynamic collapse after administration of exogenous corticosteroid or \u03b2-blockers.",

The present study evaluated the permeation of \u03b2-blockers propranolol, betaxolol, and timolol across human epidermal membrane (HEM) from a topical gel in Franz diffusion cells in vitro under various dosing conditions. The effects of occlusion and dosing volume on percutaneous absorption of \u03b2-blockers from the gel were studied. The permeation data were compared with those of finite dose diffusion theory. The results showed that skin permeation of \u03b2-blockers generally could be enhanced two to three times by skin occlusion. The cumulative amounts of \u03b2-blockers permeated across HEM increased with increasing dosing volume. An adequate fit was obtained between the theoretical curve and experimental permeation data, indicating that the experimental results of the gel are consistent with finite dose diffusion theory. In conclusion, the findings suggest the feasibility of using topical gels of \u03b2-blockers for infantile hemangioma treatment and topical application with skin occlusion is preferred.",

The photodegradation mechanism was verified by reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching method, and the photoproducts security was evaluated by luminescent bacteria toxicity test. The results showed that the rate of photolysis (k) of PRO decreased with increasing initial concentration, and showed a significant negative correlation (r2 > 0.95). The increasing k value was also accompanied with higher pH of the solution, and the k values were 0.0953-0.267 min(-1) under pH 5-9. ROS quenching experiments showed that the PRO UV photolysis process included a triplet PRO (3PRO*) direct photolysis participation, and self-sensitized photolysis participation caused by hydroxyl radical (\u00b7OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2). Direct photolysis rate was greater than the rate of self-sensitized photolysis. The result of 1O2 steady concentration measured by FFA as the probe was consistent with the quenching method. The toxicity evaluation illustrated the formation of some intermediate photoproducts, which were more toxic than PRO.",

Kv7 channels were examined at the molecular level and by functional studies using RT-qPCR and myography, respectively. We found mRNA expression of KCNQ1, KCNQ3-KCNQ5 and KCNE1-5 in the human urinary bladder from patients with normal bladder function (n = 7) and in patients with bladder outflow obstruction (n = 3). Interestingly, a 3.4-fold up-regulation of KCNQ1 was observed in the latter. The Kv7 channel subtype selective modulators, ML277 (activator of Kv7.1 channels, 10 \u03bcM) and ML213 (activator of Kv7.2, Kv7.4, Kv7.4/7.5 and Kv7.5 channels, 10 \u03bcM), reduced the tone of 1 \u03bcM carbachol pre-constricted bladder strips. XE991 (blocker of Kv7.1-7.5 channels, 10 \u03bcM) had opposing effects as it increased contractions achieved with 20 mM KPSS. Furthermore, we investigated if there is interplay between Kv7 channels and \u03b2-adrenoceptors. Using cumulative additions of isoprenaline (\u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist) and forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator) in combination with the Kv7 channel activator and blocker, retigabine and XE991, we did not find interplay between Kv7 channels and \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the human urinary bladder.

To determine free energies maps of functional groups of these LBPs, a Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo/Molecular Dynamics (GCMC/MD) strategy is combined with the Site Identification by Ligand Competitive Saturation (SILCS) methodology. SILCS-GCMC/MD is shown to map functional group affinity patterns that recapitulate locations of functional groups across diverse classes of ligands in the LBPs of the androgen (AR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) NRs and the metabotropic glutamate (mGluR) and \u03b22-adreneric (\u03b22AR) GPCRs. Inclusion of protein flexibility identifies regions of the binding pockets not accessible in crystal conformations and allows for better quantitative estimates of relative ligand binding affinities in all the proteins tested. Differences in functional group requirements of the active and inactive states of the \u03b22AR LBP were used in virtual screening to identify high efficacy agonists targeting \u03b22AR in Airway Smooth Muscle (ASM) cells.

We reported that associative learning, as opposed to perceptual learning, was not affected by labetalol infusions in the olfactory bulb.

CYP2D44 is highly homologous to human CYP2D6 that is known to be polymorphic with a large inter-individual variation in metabolic activities, however, genetic polymorphisms have not been investigated in macaque CYP2D44. In the present study, screening of 78 cynomolgus and 40 rhesus macaques found a total of 67 variants, including 64 non-synonymous variants, 1 nonsense mutation, and 2 frameshift mutations, and 1 gene conversion, of which 14, 19, and 15 variants were unique to Indochinese cynomolgus macaques, Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, and Chinese rhesus macaques, respectively. Eleven of the 64 non-synonymous variants were located in substrate recognition sites, the regions important for protein function.

The developed HPLC method was found to be linear in the range of 0.2-20 \u03bcg ml(-1) for AT, 0.2-20 \u03bcg ml(-1) for ST, 0.1-15 \u03bcg ml(-1) for MT, 0.1-15 \u03bcg ml(-1) for BS, 0.1-13 \u03bcg ml(-1) for PR, 0.1-13 \u03bcg ml(-1) for CV and 0.4-20 \u03bcg ml(-1) for NB. No significant difference between the results of the proposed GA-PLS and HPLC methods with respect to accuracy and precision. The proposed analytical methods did not show any interference of the excipients when applied to pharmaceutical products.", 
    "139": "Unlike traditional beta receptor antagonists, nebivolol activates nitric oxide. We hypothesized that therapy with nebivolol compared with metoprolol would improve arterial stiffness, increase levels of circulating progenitor cells (PC), and decrease oxidative stress (OS). In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, 30 hypertensive subjects received either once daily nebivolol or metoprolol succinate for 3 months each. Pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were measured using tonometry. Flow cytometry was used to measure circulating PC. OS was measured as plasma aminothiols. Measurements were performed at baseline, and repeated at 3 and 6 months. No significant differences were present between the levels of OS, arterial stiffness, and PC numbers during treatment with metoprolol compared with nebivolol. In subgroup analyses of beta-blocker na\u00efve subjects (n = 19), nebivolol reduced pulse wave velocity significantly compared with metoprolol (-1.4 \u00b1 1.9 vs. -0.1 \u00b1 2.2; P = .005).

    "151": "The histamine system is involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system. We used gene-targeted mice to investigate the role of histamine receptors in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed histamine H1, H2, and H3 receptor expression in the superior cervical ganglion, which contains sympathetic nerve cell bodies. We measured the heart rate variability (HRV), the changes in the beat-to-beat heart rate, which is widely used to assess autonomic activity in the heart. H1 blockade attenuated the baroreflex-mediated changes in heart rate in wild-type (WT) mice, whereas the heart rate response to H2- and H3-specific blockers was unaffected. l-Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) expression in the superior cervical ganglion of H1R-null mice was higher than that in WT controls, whereas the enzyme levels in H2R- and H3R-null mice were not significantly different from those in the WT. All mutant mice (H1R-, H2R-, and H3R-null mice) showed normal electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns with little modification in ECG parameters and the expected response to the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Similar to our findings in WT mice, H1 blockade attenuated the baroreflex-mediated heart rate change in H1R-null mice, whereas the heart rate response was unaffected in H2R- and H3R-null mice. The HRV analysis revealed relatively unstable RR intervals, an increased standard deviation of the interbeat interval (SDNN), and low-frequency (LF) component in H1R-null mice compared with the other groups, suggesting that sympathetic nerve activity was altered in H1R-null mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that H1 receptors play a major role in the regulation of sympathetic nerve activity.",

Based on this regulation, there is a demand for dynamic analytical procedures for analyzing these compounds quickly and without manual sample preparation. Therefore, the use of a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) in a multidimensional liquid chromatographic system coupled to a mass spectrometer provides a good alternative for improving the selectivity and practicality of the beta-blocker analyses, as described in this paper. A water-compatible MIP for oxprenolol was synthesized by the precipitation method, using methacrylic acid as a functional monomer and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and glycerol dimethacrylate as hydrophilic monomers. A column filled with MIP was coupled to an LC-MS/MS instrument under the multidimensional configuration, with 10.0 mmol L(-1) ammonium formate buffer (pH 5.0) as the loading and reconditioning mobile phase and a 0.01% formic acid aqueous solution-methanol (30\u2009:\u200970 v\u2009:\u2009v) as the elution mobile phase.

We confirmed that PAH P-EC proliferate more than control cells and stimulate more PA smooth muscle cell mitosis, a growth abnormality that was normalized by nebivolol but not by metoprolol. Nebivolol but not metoprolol induced endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide-dependent relaxation of PA. Nebivolol was more potent than metoprolol in improving cardiac function, pulmonary vascular remodeling, and inflammation of rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension.",

    "165": "Glaucoma is a group of chronic and evolutive optic neuropathies. It is caracterised by a progressive loss of optic nerve cells with specific modifications of the optic nerve head and of the visual field. A high intraocular pressure is one of the main risk factors. Thereby, the aim of glaucoma treatment is to reduce the intraocular pressure by medical, physical and/or surgical means. Eyedrops are used as initial treatment. As the most effective drops, prostaglandin analogs are the first-line therapy and have only few systemic side effects. Beta-blockers, local carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and alpha-agonists are the other most employed glaucoma drugs. Pilocarpine, acetazolamide and hyperosmotic agents are used in specific cases. Fixed combinations improve the compliance and the quality of life of patients who need several eyedrops. Preservative-free drops reduce ocular toxicity and improve the compliance of the patients. Trabeculoplasty or trabeculectomy are usefull in case of non response on ocular drops, or if the target pressure is not reached, or when dealing with toxicity or compliance matters. Nevertheless, the first procedure has a time-limited efficiency and the second-one exposes the patient to common surgery-related complications.

    "167": "The crosstalk between the immune and the autonomic nervous system may impact the cardiovascular function. Toll-like receptors are components of the innate immune system and play developmental and physiological roles. Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension and heart failure. Since such diseases are commonly accompanied by autonomic imbalance and lower baroreflex sensitivity, we hypothesized that TLR9 modulates cardiac autonomic and baroreflex control of arterial pressure (AP). Toll-like receptor 9 knockout (TLR9 KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were implanted with catheters into carotid artery and jugular vein and allowed to recover for 3 days. After basal recording of AP, mice received methyl-atropine or propranolol. AP and pulse interval (PI) variability were evaluated in the time and frequency domain (spectral analysis), as well as by multiscale entropy. Spontaneous baroreflex was studied by sequence technique. Behavioral and cardiovascular responses to fear-conditioning stress were also evaluated. AP was similar between groups, but TLR9 KO mice exhibited lower basal heart rate (HR). AP variability was not different, but PI variability was increased in TLR9 KO mice. The total entropy was higher in TLR9 KO mice. Moreover, baroreflex function was found higher in TLR9 KO mice. Atropine-induced tachycardia was increased in TLR9 KO mice, whereas the propranolol-induced bradycardia was similar to WT mice. TLR9 KO mice exhibit increased behavioral and decreased tachycardia responses to fear-conditioning stress. In conclusion, our findings suggest that TLR9 may negatively modulate cardiac vagal tone and baroreflex in mice.", 
    "168": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common complication of an ICU admission. Rarely is there a continuation of care, which is aimed at screening for and treating this debilitating disease. Current treatment options for PTSD are held back by inconsistent efficacy, poor evidence, and a lack of understanding of its psychopathology. Without 'gold standard' assessment techniques to diagnose PTSD after an ICU admission, the development of care pathways is hindered. This paper advocates for two interwoven advances in psychiatric care (specifically for PTSD) after ICU: (1) incorporate the monitoring and treating of psychiatric co-morbidities during extended patient follow-up, and (2) rapidly adopting the latest research to maximize its benefit. The discovery that memories were not fixed, but malleable to change, set off a sequence of experiments that have revolutionized the approach to treating PTSD. It is hoped that the phenomenon of reconsolidation can be exploited therapeutically. In the act of remembering and re-storing traumatic memories, propranolol can act to dissociate the state of sympathetic arousal from their recollection. Often, ICU patients have multiple physical co-morbidities that may be exacerbated, or their treatment disrupted, by such a pervasive psychological condition. The rapid uptake of new techniques, aimed at reducing PTSD after ICU admission, is necessary to maximize the quality of care given to patients. Increasingly, the realization that the role of intensive care specialists may extend beyond the ICU is changing clinical practice. As this field advances, intensivists and psychiatrists alike must collaborate by using the latest psychopharmacology to treat their patients and combat the psychological consequences of experiencing the extremes of physiological existence.",

    "170": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common inflammatory and oxidant disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreases oxidative stress, intracellular free calcium ion [Ca(2+)]i, and apoptosis levels in human neutrophil. We aimed to investigate the effects of NAC on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and Ca(2+) entry through transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and TRP melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channels in neutrophils from patients with PCOS. Neutrophils isolated from PCOS group were investigated in three settings: (1) after incubation with TRPV1 channel blocker capsazepine or TRPM2 channel blocker 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB), (2) after supplementation with NAC (for 6 weeks), and (3) with combination (capsazepine + 2-APB + NAC) exposure. The neutrophils in TRPM2 and TRPV1 experiments were stimulated by N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP; 1 \u03bcM) and capsaicin (10 \u03bcM) as concentration agonists, respectively. Neutrophil lipid peroxidation and capsaicin-induced increase in [Ca(2+)]i concentrations were reduced by capsazepine and NAC treatments. However, the [Ca(2+)]i concentration did not change by fMLP stimulation. Neutrophil lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-9, cytosolic reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization values were decreased by NAC treatment although neutrophil glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione levels were increased by the NAC treatment. Serum lipid peroxidation, luteinizing hormone, testosterone, insulin, interleukin-1 beta, and homocysteine levels were decreased by NAC treatment although serum vitamin A, beta-carotene, vitamin E, and total antioxidant status were increased by the NAC treatment. In conclusion, NAC reduced oxidative stress, apoptosis, cytokine levels, and Ca(2+) entry through TRPV1 channel, which provide supportive evidence that oxidative stress and TRPV1 channel plays a key role in etiology of PCOS.",

Infantile hemangiomas have variable clinical features: superficial, deep or mixed. They can be localized or segmental involving a large skin area. Localized infantile hemangiomas are usually benign, unless they are located near a noble structure (airway orbit...), while segmental infantile hemangioma may be associated with complex underlying birth defects (PHACES and SACRAL syndromes). Clinical follow-up of infants with infantile hemangioma must be particularly careful in the first weeks of life since 80% of all infantile hemangiomas have reached their final size at age 5 months. A majority of infantile hemangiomas are mild and do not required any treatment. Main indications for treatment are: vital risk (heart failure, respiratory distress), functional risk (amblyopia, swallowing disorders...), painful ulceration and disfigurement (face involvement of nose, lips...). Propranolol, has been quickly adopted as the first line medical treatment for complicated infantile hemangioma; and it is the only treatment to have a marketing authorization in this indication. It is recommended to begin the treatment as early as possible before three months of age to minimize the risk of complications and sequelae.", 
    "172": "Fibrotic lung disease afflicts millions of people; the central problem is progressive lung destruction and remodeling. We have shown that external growth factors regulate fibroblast function not only through canonical signaling pathways but also through propagation of periodic oscillations in Ca(2+). In this study, we characterized the pharmacological sensitivity of the Ca(2+)oscillations and determined whether a blocker of those oscillations can prevent the progression of fibrosis in vivo. We found Ca(2+) oscillations evoked by exogenously applied transforming growth factor \u03b2 in normal human fibroblasts were substantially reduced by 1 \u03bcM nifedipine or 1 \u03bcM verapamil (both L-type blockers), by 2.7 \u03bcM mibefradil (a mixed L-/T-type blocker), by 40 \u03bcM NiCl2 (selective at this concentration against T-type current), by 30 mM KCl (which partially depolarizes the membrane and thereby fully inactivates T-type current but leaves L-type current intact), or by 1 mM NiCl2 (blocks both L- and T-type currents). In our in vivo study in mice, nifedipine prevented bleomycin-induced fibrotic changes (increased lung stiffness, overexpression of smooth muscle actin, increased extracellular matrix deposition, and increased soluble collagen and hydroxyproline content). Nifedipine had little or no effect on lung inflammation, suggesting its protective effect on lung fibrosis was not due to an antiinflammatory effect but rather was due to altering the profibrotic response to bleomycin. Collectively, these data show that nifedipine disrupts Ca(2+) oscillations in fibroblasts and prevents the impairment of lung function in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis. Our results provide compelling proof-of-principle that interfering with Ca(2+) signaling may be beneficial against pulmonary fibrosis.", 
    "173": "To achieve the synchronous skin permeation of indapamide (IND) and bisoprolol (BSP) in their compound patch, the techniques of ion-pair complexation and chemical enhancers were combined to dual-directionally regulate drug permeating amounts. Ion-pair complexes of BSP and various organic acids were formed by the technique of ion-pair complexation. Among the complexes formed, bisoprolol tartrate (BSP.T) down-regulated the permeating amount of BSP to the same extent as that of IND. Then, to simultaneously up-regulate the amounts of the two drugs, an enhancer combination of 15.8% Span80 (SP), 6.0% Azone (AZ) and 2.2% N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) was obtained by central composite design and exhibited an outstanding and simultaneous enhancement on IND and BSP with enhancing ratio (ER) of 4.52 and 3.49, respectively. The effect of the dual-directional regulation was evaluated by in vitro permeation experiments and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. For IND and BSP, their observed permeation profiles were comparable and their MAT (mean absorption time) showed no significant difference, which both demonstrated these two drugs achieved the synchronous skin permeation in their compound patch by the dual-directional regulation strategy of combining the technique of ion-pair complexation with chemical enhancers.",

In patients with chronic HF, prevalence of DM is 24% compared with 40% in those hospitalized with worsening HF. Patients with concomitant HF and DM have diverse pathophysiologic, metabolic, and neurohormonal abnormalities that potentially contribute to worse outcomes than those without comorbid DM. In addition, although stable HF outpatients with DM show responses that are similar to those of patients without DM undergoing evidence-based therapies, it is unclear whether hospitalized HF patients with DM will respond similarly to novel investigational therapies. These data support the need to re-evaluate the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy of HF patients with concomitant DM. This paper discusses the role of DM in HF patients and underscores the potential need for the development of targeted therapies.",

For estimating the \u03b2-AR subtypes involved, subtype-selective receptor blockers were used, that is, CGP 20712A (\u03b21-ARs), ICI 118,551 (\u03b22-ARs), and L748,337 (\u03b23-ARs).", 
    "185": "Unlike in KCl-pre-contracted muscle, the mucosa did not affect the sensitivity of the relaxation response to (-)-isoprenaline in CCh-pre-contracted murine detrusor strips. Increasing concentrations of (-)-isoprenaline produced a biphasic concentration-relaxation response without any difference both during the presence and absence of mucosa. The relaxation fraction produced by low (-)-isoprenaline concentrations was mediated by \u03b22-AR as evidenced by a shift of the concentration-response curve to higher concentrations with ICI 118,551, but not with CGP 20712A and L748,337, and by the absence of this fraction in \u03b22-AR-KO mice. The relaxation response with low sensitivity to (-)-isoprenaline was not affected by any of the \u03b2-AR subtype-selective blockers and was the only response detected in detrusor strips from \u03b22-AR-KO mice.", 
    "186": "In CCh-pre-contracted mouse detrusor, \u03b22-ARs are responsible for the relaxation component with high sensitivity to (-)-isoprenaline as indicated by the conversion of a biphasic into a monophasic CRC with ICI 118,551 or by its absence in \u03b22-AR KO mice. The mucosa does not impair relaxation under these conditions.",

    "188": "Consecutive case series with chart review of isolated subglottic hemangiomas without cutaneous lesions.", 
    "189": "Two patients with isolated subglottic hemangiomas without cutaneous lesions were identified. Both patients presented with stridor and were initially treated with systemic corticosteroids, racemic epinephrine, and supportive medical therapy for a presumed infectious etiology. After failure to clinically improve over an expected period of time, endoscopy was performed. Propranolol was initiated immediately after the diagnosis was made. Clinical response was noted in the first 24 hours after administration. Both children were able to be safely titrated up to the therapeutic dose (2mg/kg/day). No complications or re-admissions were encountered.", 
    "190": "Clinical suspicion for a subglottic hemangioma in an infant with stridor may be high in cases where there is a synchronous cutaneous lesion. In infants without cutaneous involvement, diagnosis may be delayed and more challenging, given the possibility of an infectious etiology. These infants without a synchronous cutaneous lesion tend to present at an older age than infants with cutaneous lesions and may be managed successfully with propranolol.", 
    "191": "Reduced catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity resulting from genetic variation or pharmacological depletion results in enhanced pain perception in humans and nociceptive behaviors in animals. Using phasic mechanical and thermal reflex tests (e.g. von Frey, Hargreaves), recent studies show that acute COMT-dependent pain in rats is mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs). In order to more closely mimic the characteristics of human chronic pain conditions associated with prolonged reductions in COMT, the present study sought to determine volitional pain-related and anxiety-like behavioral responses following sustained as well as acute COMT inhibition using an operant 10-45\u00b0C thermal place preference task and a light/dark preference test. In addition, we sought to evaluate the effects of sustained COMT inhibition on generalized body pain by measuring tactile sensory thresholds of the abdominal region. Results demonstrated that acute and sustained administration of the COMT inhibitor OR486 increased pain behavior in response to thermal heat. Further, sustained administration of OR486 increased anxiety behavior in response to bright light, as well as abdominal mechanosensation. Finally, all pain-related behaviors were blocked by the non-selective \u03b2AR antagonist propranolol. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that stimulation of \u03b2ARs following acute or chronic COMT inhibition drives cognitive-affective behaviors associated with heightened pain that affects multiple body sites."
