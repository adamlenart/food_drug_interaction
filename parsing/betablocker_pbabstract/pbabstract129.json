This analysis aims at evaluating, whether there are gender disparities in antihypertensive drug usage and blood pressure (BP) control. We included 18 017 patients with arterial hypertension from the International Survey Evaluating Microalbuminuria Routinely by Cardiologists in patients with Hypertension (I-SEARCH). The study was conducted between September 2005 and March 2006 in 26 countries, and data on patient demographics, cardiovascular disease and risk factors, BP, and cardiovascular drug treatment were collected. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 2.1 mm Hg higher in women (150.6+/-0.35 mm Hg, n=8357/18 017) than in men (148.5+/-0.35 mm Hg; P<0.0001, n=9526/18 017), whereas no difference in diastolic BP was seen (88.2+/-0.20 vs 88+/-0.20 mm Hg; P=0.198). Gender differences in SBP were more pronounced in diabetic as compared with non-diabetic patients (3.5 vs 1.7 mm Hg, n=4272 vs n=13 611; P<0.0001) and became evident at an age 55 years old. Overall BP-control rate was 33.6% in men and 30.6% in women (P<0.0001) and was lower in diabetic as compared with non-diabetic patients. In all, 30% of patients used one, 40% used two and 30% used > or = 3 drugs without gender differences. Response rates to different drug regimens appeared to be similar. However, women received more frequently thiazides and beta-blockers, and less frequently ACE-inhibitors as monotherapy. Major efforts are required to improve BP-management, especially in women.", 
    "1": "The direct effects of famotidine, a selective histamine H(2) receptor antagonist, on the cardiac repolarization process were assessed using two in vitro test systems. Neither famotidine (0.1 and 1 microM), nor its solvent, dimethylsulfoxide (0.1%), affected any of the action potential parameters of guinea-pig papillary muscles, whereas the positive control, dl-sotalol (30 microM), significantly prolonged the action potential duration. Moreover, neither famotidine (0.1, 1 and 10 microM) nor dimethylsulfoxide affected the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) K(+) current expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells, whereas the positive control, E-4031 (0.1 microM), significantly decreased the current. These results indicate famotidine does not directly affect the cardiac repolarization process.", 
    "2": "To investigate quantitatively the effect of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) on the microvasculature of the optic nerve with and without topical treatment with two hypotensive drugs, timolol and latanoprost.", 
    "3": "Three groups of rats underwent cauterization of three episcleral veins to produce elevated IOP in the right eye. Two of these groups were treated with timolol or latanoprost for 3 months. Eyeballs were incubated with anti-GLUT-1 polyclonal antibody. GLUT-1-positive capillaries of the optic nerve head (ONH) and optic nerve exit (ON) were examined and analyzed for their number per square millimeter, volume fraction, length per unit volume, surface area per unit volume, and mean diameter.", 
    "4": "An increase in IOP resulted in a significant decrease in microvessel density in the laminar region (LR) and postlaminar region (PR) and ON compared with the control group. The other parameters fell significantly in all regions of the optic nerve. Topical treatment with timolol or latanoprost did not modify the density of the capillaries, although the other parameters increased significantly compared with the untreated experimental group. Additionally, the mean diameter of the capillaries in the LR and the PR recovered after treatment.", 
    "5": "The results indicate that the capillaries of the LR and the PR of the ONH are the most susceptible to IOP elevation. The authors suggest that timolol and latanoprost have a certain vascular action by increasing the available blood volume, surface area per unit volume, length per unit volume, and diameter of the capillaries of the ONH in these two regions.", 
    "6": "Subglottic haemangioma is a rare but potentially life threatening condition which requires intervention. Many different treatments have been described with varying degrees of success and complications. Recently, successful treatment with propranolol has been reported in 11 cases of cutaneous haemangiomas and then in two cases of subglottic haemangiomas with extensive cutaneous lesions in conjunction with other treatment modalities. We describe the successful treatment with propranolol, of a stridulous four-month-old child with a 95% obstructing subglottic haemangioma. This was achieved without the need for tracheostomy or any other surgical intervention, and with no reported side effects. We now believe the new discovery of a dramatic response to propranolol allows treatment in the acute setting and following further study may render surgical treatment of subglottic haemangioma obsolete.", 
    "7": "Activation of bradykinin-mediated B2 receptor has been shown to play an important role in the onset of angioedema associated with C1 inhibitor deficiency. This finding has led to the development of novel therapeutic drugs such as the B2 receptor antagonist icatibant. However, it is unclear whether other receptors expressed on endothelial cells contribute to the release of kinins and vascular leakage in these patients. The recognition of their role may have obvious therapeutic implications.", 
    "8": "Our aim was to investigate the involvement of B1 and gC1q receptors in in vitro and in vivo models of vascular leakage induced by plasma samples obtained from patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency.", 
    "9": "The vascular leakage was evaluated in vitro on endothelial cells by a transwell model system and in vivo on rat mesentery microvessels by intravital microscopy.", 
    "10": "We observed that the attack phase plasma from C1 inhibitor-deficient patients caused a delayed fluorescein-labeled albumin leakage as opposed to the rapid effect of bradykinin, whereas remission plasma elicited a modest effect compared with control plasma. The plasma permeabilizing effect was prevented by blocking the gC1q receptor-high-molecular-weight kininogen interaction, was partially inhibited by B2 receptor or B1 receptor antagonists, and was totally prevented by the mixture of the 2 antagonists. Involvement of B1 receptor was supported by the finding that albumin leakage caused by attack phase plasma was enhanced by IL-1beta and was markedly reduced by brefeldin A.", 
    "11": "Our data suggest that both B1 receptor and gC1q receptor are involved in the vascular leakage induced by hereditary and acquired angioedema plasma.",

    "13": "Four hundred twenty-one consecutive patients (ischemic and nonischemic) undergoing primary prevention ICD implantation were studied. Patients were grouped based on the presence/absence of appropriate ICD therapy. Summary data and stored electrograms from ICDs were reviewed to determine appropriateness of therapy. Predictors of therapy were assessed by both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis.", 
    "14": "Of 421 primary prevention patients undergoing ICD implantation, 79 (19%) had received appropriate ICD therapies. By univariate comparison, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), male sex, left ventricle diastolic diameter (LVDD), and hypertension were all significant predictors for ICD therapy over a mean follow-up time of 751 +/- 493 days (P <or= 0.05). The use of beta-blockers was found to be a negative predictor. In the ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) population, 55 (17%) patients received ICD therapy and this was predicted by NSVT, hypertension, LVDD, and left atrial diameter.beta-blockers were protective. In the nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM) population, 24 (23%) received appropriate therapies, which were predicted by NSVT, male sex, dual chamber device, lack of biventricular device, and lack of beta-blockers. By multivariate analysis, NSVT, hypertension, and lack of beta-blockers were significant for ICM, while NSVT and absence of beta-blockers were predictive for NIDCM. Ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, and QRS width were not significantly different between therapy and no-therapy groups in any population.", 
    "15": "ICD-delivered therapy occurred in 19% of primary prevention patients with both ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy and was predicted by NSVT and a lack of beta-blocker use.", 
    "16": "Exposure to novel contexts produce heightened states of arousal and biochemical changes in the brain to consolidate memory. However, processes permitting simple exposure to unfamiliar contexts to elevate sympathetic output and to improve memory are poorly understood. This shortcoming was addressed by examining how novelty-induced changes in peripheral and/or central arousal modulates memory for Pavlovian fear conditioning. Male rats were either exposed to the conditioning chamber for 5-min or given no exposure 24 h before conditioning with five tone-shock (0.35 mA) pairings. Retention was assessed 48 h later in a different context. Non-pre-exposed animals exhibited significantly greater freezing during conditioned stimulus (CS) presentations than did pre-exposed animals (P < 0.05). The improvement in retention produced by novelty was attenuated by pretraining a blockade of peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors with sotalol (6 mg/kg, i.p.). Study 2 revealed that novelty-induced increases in peripheral autonomic output are conveyed to the brain by visceral afferents that synapse upon brainstem neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Blocking AMPA receptor activity in the NTS with CNQX (1.0 microg) significantly reduced freezing to the CS in non-pre-exposed animals (P < 0.01). Study 3 showed that elevating epinephrine levels in habituated animals influences learning through mechanisms similar to those produced by novelty-induced arousal. Pre-exposed animals given epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg) froze significantly more than saline controls (P < 0.01), and this effect was attenuated by intra-NTS infusion of CNQX. The findings demonstrate that novelty-induced arousal or increasing sympathetic activity with epinephrine in pre-exposed animals enhances memory through adrenergic mechanisms initiated in the periphery and transmitted centrally via the vagus/NTS complex.",

    "18": "We evaluated 139 194 patients with NSTE-ACS in the CRUSADE quality improvement initiative. The presenting HR was summarized as 10 beat increments. Patients with systolic BP < 90 mm Hg (4030 patients) were excluded to avoid the confounding effect of cardiogenic shock. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) was calculated using a reference OR = 1 for HR of 60-69 b.p.m. after controlling for baseline variables. Primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital events all-cause mortality, non-fatal re-infarction, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were each of these considered separately. From the cohort of 135 164 patients, 8819 (6.52%) patients had a primary outcome (death/re-infarction or stroke) of which 5271 (3.90%) patients died, 3578 (2.65%) patients had re-infarction, and 1038 (0.77%) patients had a stroke during hospitalization. The relationship between presenting HR and primary outcome, all-cause mortality, and stroke followed a 'J-shaped' curve with an increased event rate at very low and high HR even after controlling for baseline variables. However, there was no relationship between presenting HR and risk of re-infarction.", 
    "19": "In contrast to patients with stable CAD, in the acute setting, the relationship between presenting HR and in-hospital cardiovascular outcomes has a 'J-shaped' curve (higher event rates at very low and high HRs). These associations should be considered in ACS prognostic models.",

    "21": "Before and after intervention study. The study was conducted in two primary care centers in Barcelona, Spain. Consecutive samples of patients with systolic heart failure who had not received previous beta-blocker treatment were recruited between April 2004 and April 2006. Treatment was started with the lowest dose of bisoprolol or carvedilol and the dose was doubled every two weeks in the absence of contraindications. Patients were followed up for 6 months.", 
    "22": "The study included 88 patients (76.1% male, 23,9% female, mean age 64.88 years). Of these, 57.1% were treated with bisoprolol and 42.9% with carvedilol. Overall, 75.0% reached the target dose, 21.7% tolerated a dose lower than the target dose, and 3.3% had the beta-blocker withdrawn (due to bradycardia in 1.1%, syncope in 1.1%, and stroke in 1.1%). Adverse events were experienced by 70.4%, the majority of which (57.95%) were resolved without changing treatment. The most common were nausea (42.04%), asthenia (35.22%), and increased dyspnea (17.04%). There were significant improvements in functional class and ejection fraction.", 
    "23": "The majority of adverse events were mild. Treatment was withdrawn in only a few patients and most reached the recommended target dose. Appropriately trained primary care physicians can uptitrate beta-blockers in heart failure patients without undue concern.", 
    "24": "A female infant presented with bradycardia and an electrocardiogram demonstrating 2:1 atrioventricular depolarization, a prolonged QT interval, and T wave alternans. After propranolol therapy was initiated, a lidocaine challenge was performed with progressive shortening of the QT interval. This positive lidocaine challenge prompted clinical suspicion of long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) and early initiation of mexiletine therapy. Subsequent genetic testing confirmed the infant's diagnosis of LQT3.", 
    "25": "The present review focuses on the effects of beta-blockers on lung function in HF patients. Indeed, historically, beta-blockers have been considered not indicated in the presence of impaired lung function but recently this concept has been challenged. Lung function abnormalities are part of the chronic HF syndrome, as both lung mechanics and gas exchange are impaired. The regulation of ventilation and gas exchange is under sympathetic control and, therefore, a possible target of beta-blockers. beta-Blocker compounds differ in terms of pharmacological action blocking either both beta1 and beta2 receptors (carvedilol), or selectively the beta1 receptors (nebivolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol). This difference is likely to explain a different action on lung function. Indeed, 90% of beta-receptors in the lung are located on the alveoli and are mainly beta2, whereas 10% are on the airways (mainly beta1-receptors). Expiratory gases and ventilation kinetic analysis during exercise on top of standard spirometry and resting lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO) provide an integrate evaluation of the respiratory function in HF patients. Carvedilol reduces hyperventilation in HF patients during the entire exercise and proportionally increases patients quality of life. However, carvedilol has a negative action at altitude when, to counterbalance hypoxia, hyperventilation is needed. Indeed, when exercise is performed at a simulated altitude of 2,000 m, PO(2) is 69 +/- 3 mmHg and 64 +/- 4, in placebo and carvedilol, respectively. Mechanical pulmonary function in HF patients at rest and during exercise is only slightly influenced by beta-blockers. beta-Blockers affect DLCO differently in chronic HF. Specifically, carvedilol reduces DLCO from 88 +/- 15% to 74 +/- 13% due to reduction of membrane diffusion, whereas bisoprolol does not influence DLCO, likely due to the absence of action by bisoprolol on alveolar beta2-receptors, which preserve active Na(+) transport processes across the alveolar-capillary membrane. In conclusion, it is possible to use beta-blockers in HF patients even in the presence of lung function impairment, but their use should be guided by a combination of lung function evaluation and knowledge of the pharmacological properties of each molecule.", 
    "26": "The aim of this study was to investigate weather beta blockers are associated with an increased mortality in sepsis.", 
    "27": "Data on 83 patients with sepsis treated in ICU were analyzed from the retrospective chart review. The association between treatment with Beta blockers and mortality was analyzed by logistic regression in univariate model and after adjusting for the APACHE morbidity/ mortality scores.", 
    "28": "Among 83 patients (mean age 56.2+/-17.3 years, female 51%, the mean APACHE score 74.8+/-23.3), 29 were treated with BB. Those treated with BB had APACHE score of 79.93+/-23.47 and those not treated with BB had APACHE score of 73.67+/-23.21. No significant difference between the traditional cardiovascular risk factors was found in both groups except for HTN. Treatment with BB was not significantly associated with mortality in the univariate (OR=1.83, 95% CI 0.59-5.69) nor multivariate model (OR=1.843, 95% CI 0.56-6.10). The APACHE score was a strong predictor of mortality (OR=1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p=0.02). This association was independent of BB use, and no significant interaction (p=0.72) between BB and APACHE score was observed.", 
    "29": "We did not show a significant association between beta blockers and increased mortality in patients with sepsis. Sicker patients had an increase risk of death, and possibility that beta blocker use may have contributed to this risk cannot be completely ruled out. Our study was limited by a small sample size and retrospective design. Further investigations of potential benefits and side effect of beta blockers in patients with sepsis are warranted.",

    "31": "In this multicentred, double-blind, 14-week study, patients were randomized to receive valsartan (V) 80 mg or placebo (P) once daily on top of background medications. The dose of valsartan was force-titrated up to 320 mg. A total of 152 patients were randomized (V = 70, P = 82). Most patients had well-controlled hypertension (V = 91.2%, P = 89.0%) (mean baseline systolic BP approximately 130 mmHg) and >50% were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and/or beta-blocker (V = 57.4%, P = 54.9%). The mean ejection fraction at baseline was 70.48% in the placebo group (n = 64) and 71.52% in the valsartan group (n = 79). Valsartan had no significant effect on exercise time (primary variable), gas exchange variables, 6 min walk test distance, exertion-related symptoms, brain natriuretic peptide levels, echocardiographic parameters, or quality-of-life scores. Valsartan significantly lowered peak exercise systolic BP (-13.1 mmHg vs. placebo; P < 0.001) and improved ratings of perceived exertion (Borg score) (-0.69 vs. placebo; P = 0.008).", 
    "32": "In this population, which predominantly included patients with well-controlled hypertension and symptomatic HFPEF, addition of valsartan did not increase exercise time within 14 weeks. However, valsartan 320 mg reduced blood pressure and improved symptoms of perceived exertion (Borg score) during exercise and was generally well-tolerated.", 
    "33": "Recently there has been speculation regarding prescription drug interactions with fruit beverages through inhibition of drug uptake transport by organic anion transporter polypeptides (OATPs). A review of clinical trials indicates that grapefruit juice (GFJ), orange juice (OJ), and apple juice can reduce oral bioavailability of fexofenadine, potentially reducing pharmacodynamic effects of fexofenadine. However, the clinical importance of the interaction is not clearly established. The effect is diminished by temporal separation of fruit juice and fexofenadine administration. GFJ and OJ substantially reduce oral bioavailability of celiprolol, a beta-blocker not available in the United States. Beyond these two examples, other meaningful drug interactions with fruit beverages via OATP inhibition are not established at the present time.",

Three of these studies were retrospective reviews, while one was a post hoc subgroup analysis from the OPTIME-CHF study. Concomitant therapy with milrinone and a beta-blocker was well tolerated, with no significant increase in adverse events or deterioration in clinical status in any study. Tolerability rates for combination therapy ranged from 88% to 92%. In 2 of the studies, roughly 50% of the patients in the combination arm were able to be weaned off milrinone. One study suggested a mortality reduction in favor of combination therapy over milrinone alone, while another study suggested no difference in mortality with combination therapy versus milrinone monotherapy. One study suggested a potential increase in mortality when beta-blocker therapy was withdrawn in patients who were started on milrinone. None of the studies demonstrated any significant differences in hospitalization rates. All of the studies were limited by their retrospective nature and small sample size.",

Hemangiomas are usually sporadic; their etiology is unknown. A premature female infant, born at 28 weeks of gestation, presented with a large hemangioma of the right thoracic wall. Within the first few weeks, the hemangioma showed rapid horizontal and vertical growth as well as ulceration, which led us to initiate systemic therapy. The effectiveness of propranolol (non-selective ss-blocker) in the management of severe cases of hemangioma has been shown in a recent series of cases. We began oral propranolol treatment, in close interdisciplinary cooperation. After a few days of therapy, the tumor had stopped expanding. After 18 weeks, there has been marked regression but the therapy is still being continued. We propose that propranolol may be an effective and relatively well tolerable alternative in the management of selected cases of severe hemangiomas in infancy, providing interdisciplinary cooperation between dermatologists and pediatricians is available.",

In order to achieve a good enantioseparation, the effect of dibutyl l-tartrate and sodium tetraborate concentration, surfactant identity and concentration, cosurfactant, buffer pH and composition, organic modifiers, as well as applied voltage and capillary length were investigated. Ten pairs of enantiomers that could not be separated with only dibutyl l-tartrate, obtained good chiral separation using the complex chiral selector; among them, seven pairs could be baseline resolved under optimized experimental conditions. The fixation of chiral centers by the formation of five-membered rings, and being oppositely charged with basic analytes were thought to be the key factors giving the complex chiral selector a superior chiral recognition capability.

Cholinergic and adrenergic drugs can be applied topically to evaluate the effects on the pupil and accommodative system without input from the EW nucleus. This study is directed at characterizing how topical low dose echothiophate, an anti-cholinesterase inhibitor (i.e., an indirect cholinergic agonist), epinephrine, an adrenergic agonist, and timolol maleate, a beta adrenergic antagonist, affect pupil diameter, resting refraction and accommodative amplitude and dynamics in rhesus monkeys. The effects of 0.015% echothiophate, 2% epinephrine, 0.5% timolol maleate and saline on pupil diameter and resting refraction were measured in one eye each of four normal rhesus monkeys for 60-90 min following topical instillation. Pupil diameter was measured with infrared videography and refraction was measured with a Hartinger coincidence refractometer. Effects on static and dynamic EW stimulated accommodation were studied in three iridectomized monkeys (ages 5, 6 and 12 years) with permanent indwelling stimulating electrodes in the EW nucleus. Dynamic accommodative responses were measured with infrared photorefraction for increasing current amplitudes before and during the course of action of the pharmacological agents. Echothiophate caused a significant decrease in pupil diameter of 3.07 +/- 0.65 mm (mean +/- SEM, p < 0.01), and a myopic shift in resting refraction of 1.30 +/- 0.39 D (p < 0.05) 90 min after instillation. Epinephrine caused a 2.76 +/- 0.38 mm (p < 0.01) increase in pupil diameter with no change in resting refraction 60 min after instillation. Timolol maleate resulted in no significant change in either pupil diameter or resting refraction 60 min after instillation. There was no significant change in maximum EW stimulated accommodative amplitude after any agent tested. The amplitude vs. peak velocity relationship for accommodation was significantly different after echothiophate and timolol maleate, and for disaccommodation after echothiophate, epinephrine and timolol maleate. In conclusion, when tested objectively in anesthetized monkeys, epinephrine and timolol maleate did not alter resting refraction or accommodative amplitude, but did have small, significant affects on accommodative dynamics. This suggests that there is an adrenergic component to the accommodative system. Low dose echothiophate had significant effects on pupil diameter and resting refraction, with only small effects on the dynamics of the accommodative response.",

    "92": "Bioavailability of talinolol, a beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, was enhanced by coadministration with grapefruit juice (GFJ) in rats, whereas GFJ ingestion markedly reduced the absorption of talinolol in humans. Because our recent study indicated that the inhibitory effect of GFJ on organic anion-transporting polypeptide (Oatp)- and P-gp-mediated talinolol absorption depends on the concentration of naringin in ingested GFJ, the apparent inconsistent findings may be explained by the species difference in the affinity of naringin for OATP/Oatp and P-gp multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1/Mdr1) between humans and rats. Although human MDR1-mediated talinolol transport was not inhibited by 2000 microM naringin, naringin inhibited human OATP1A2-, rat Oatp1a5-, and rat Mdr1a-mediated talinolol transport with IC(50) values of 343, 12.7, and 604 microM, respectively, in LLC-PK1 cell and Xenopus laevis oocyte systems. Because the naringin concentration in commercially prepared GFJ was found to be approximately 1200 microM, these results suggested that GFJ would reduce the intestinal absorption of talinolol through inhibition of OATP1A2-mediated talinolol uptake in humans, whereas an increase of talinolol absorption is mainly through inhibition of Mdr1a-mediated efflux in rats. The rat intestinal permeability of talinolol measured by the in situ closed loop method was indeed significantly increased in the presence of GFJ, whereas a significant decrease was observed with 6-fold diluted GFJ, in which the naringin concentration was approximately 200 microM. The present study indicated that the species difference in the effect of GFJ on intestinal absorption of talinolol between humans and rats may be due to differences in the affinity of naringin for OATP/Oatp and MDR1/Mdr1 transporters between the two species.",

Eight beta-blockers were enantiomerically resolved on the AGP column whereas only four beta-blockers were resolved on the HSA column. Moreover, interactions between beta-blockers and AGP were much stronger than those with HSA. Retention values on both HSA and AGP for less retained enantiomers related well with various lipophilicity parameters, with the best relationships found with log k(w)(IAM) values obtained on HPLC stationary phases supporting phospholipids, i.e. the so-called Immobilized Artificial Membrane (IAM). Differently from n-octanol lipophilicity values, these values encode both lipophilic. Electrostatic intermolecular recognition forces which may be involved in the interaction between ionized analytes, such as beta-blockers, and proteins. However, their effectiveness to describe non-specific interactions with serum-proteins for other classes of drugs needs further investigations. Analyses performed on AGP with eluent containing dimethyloctylamine (DMOA) as the displacer demonstrated that enantioselective sites bind to both (-)-forms and (+)-forms, but the binding to (-)-forms is stronger. The enantiomer competition to bind to a same site may be relevant from a pharmacokinetic point of view when racemic mixtures are administered. Finally, in contrast to previously reported data in the literature, we found that AGP can bind enantioselectively not only the more lipophilic congeners but also the less lipophilic ones.",

She had received atenolol for hypertension for 3 years prior to surgery and it was reintroduced at a dose of 100 mg/day because of recurrence of hypertension. One month later, she presented with acute hepatitis. The first post-LT liver biopsy was performed. Histologic examination disclosed a combination of portal and centrilobular inflammatory lesions. The diagnosis of acute rejection was accepted and 3 bolus doses of prednisone 500 mg/day were administered. Evolution was not favorable and a second liver biopsy was obtained. Histologic examination showed the complete disappearance of portal inflammatory lesions but an increase of centrilobular lesions. Toxic hepatitis was suspected and atenolol was stopped. No other therapeutic modification was done and resolution of the toxicity was good. An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probable.",

Moreover, the patient had been treated with atenolol for 3 years before LT: in the absence of any other etiology, the possibility that she had drug-induced cirrhosis may therefore be considered.

The methodology is based on the integration of Taylor dispersion analysis and capillary electrophoresis and is here demonstrated using commercially available capillary electrophoresis instrumentation modified with a pixel sensor UV area imager, allowing two detection points along the capillary. Analytes are the human serum proteins alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein and albumin interacting with the drug propranolol in a frontal analysis mode. Upon introduction of the propranolol-protein sample, voltage is initially applied to facilitate electrophoretically mediated separation of ligand and protein and frontal analysis. Then a pressure mobilization step is used whereby Taylor dispersion can be characterized online based on the signal from the UV area imager. Estimates of ligand binding and values for hydrodynamic radii agree with values obtained by independent methods.",

In women, an increasing number of unfavorable alleles (i.e., alleles conferring higher LDL and lower HDL) of score LDL+HDL (P = 0.037) and of score LDL (P = 0.023) was associated with less pronounced fluvastatin-induced LDL reduction. Furthermore, in women, both score LDL+HDL (P = 0.001) and score HDL (P = 0.022) were directly correlated with more pronounced fluvastatin-induced HDL increase, explaining 5.9-11.6% of the variance in treatment response in women. There were no such associations in men. This suggests that a gene score based on variation in nine different LDL- and HDL-associated genes is of importance for the magnitude of fluvastatin HDL increase in women with asymptomatic plaque in the carotid artery.",

We investigated the protective effect of carvedilol, an antihypertensive with strong antioxidant properties, against the nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin in rats. Carvedilol was able to counteract the renal damage by preventing the mitochondrial dysfunction induced by cisplatin. The mitochondrial eletrochemical potential, calcium uptake, respiration and the phosphorylative capacity were preserved by the co-administration of carvedilol. The mechanism of protection probably does not involve alterations in the cellular and sub-cellular distribution of cisplatin. The study suggests that carvedilol is a potential drug for the adjuvant nephroprotective therapy during cisplatin chemotherapy.",

Perioperative beta-blocker administration is the standard of care at many centers. Although prophylactic administration of magnesium sulfate (MgSO(4)) has been recommended, review of all previously published trials of MgSO(4) reveals conflicting results. This study was designed to address methodological shortcomings from previous studies and is the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous (IV) MgSO(4) for the prevention of AA after coronary artery bypass grafting or cardiac valvular surgery.", 
    "109": "A total of 927 nonemergent cardiac surgery patients were stratified into 2 groups: isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (n=694), or valve surgery with or without coronary artery bypass grafting (n=233), and randomized to receive either 5g IV MgSO(4) or placebo on removal of the cross-clamp, followed by daily 4-hour infusions, from postoperative day 1 until postoperative day 4. All patients were treated according to an established oral beta-blocker protocol. Postoperative serum Mg levels were checked and standard of care was to administer IV MgSO(4) for low serum levels. The primary end point was AA lasting > or =30 minutes or requiring treatment for hemodynamic compromise. There were no differences in the incidence of AA between patients who received IV MgSO(4) or placebo (26.4% versus 24.3%, respectively). The results were similar when broken down according to stratified groups.",

    "111": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the long term use of L-DOPA results in major adverse effects including dyskinesia or abnormal involuntary movements. The present study focuses on the effect of the selective alpha(1) adrenoceptor antagonist HEAT (2-[[beta-(-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]aminomethyl]-1-tetralone) in the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. We demonstrate that the selective alpha(1) adrenoceptor antagonist HEAT (1 and 2 mg kg(-1)), the alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (9 mg kg(-1)), and the nonselective beta(1)/beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (20 mg kg(-1)) alleviate dyskinetic movements induced by L-DOPA. Furthermore, the adrenoceptor antagonists at the doses used did not influence exploratory behavior in the open field system indicating that the antidyskinetic effect is not due to a reduction in general motor activity. Intrastriatal administration of the selective alpha(1) adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline via reverse in vivo microdialysis did not induce dyskinesia. Additionally, we measured plasma, brain, and CSF levels of HEAT. HEAT is a CNS active compound with a brain/plasma and CSF/plasma ratio of 4.29 and 0.15, respectively, which is appropriate for the investigation of alpha(1)-mediated mechanisms in CNS disorders. In conclusion, these results demonstrated for the first time that a alpha(1) adrenoceptor antagonist reduced L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in a rat model. Further studies assessing the risk benefit in comparison to existing therapies are needed before considering alpha(1) adrenoceptor antagonists as a target for the development of new antidyskinetic compounds.", 
    "112": "Blood pressure-lowering therapy reduces left ventricular mass, but the question of whether differences exist among drug classes has not been fully resolved. Our aim was to compare the effects of diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers on left ventricular mass regression in patients with hypertension on the basis of prospective, randomized comparative studies. We performed meta-analyses, involving pooled pairwise comparisons of the drug classes and of each class versus other classes statistically combined, and meta-regression analyses to identify the determinants of the regression. The 75 relevant publications involved 84 pairwise comparisons and 6001 patients. Regression of left ventricular mass was significantly less (P=0.01) with beta-blockers (9.8%) than with angiotensin receptor blockers (12.5%), but none of the other analyzable pairwise comparisons between drug classes revealed significant differences (P>0.10). In addition, beta-blockers showed less regression than the other 4 classes statistically combined (P<0.01), and regression was more pronounced with angiotensin receptor blockers versus the others (P<0.01). In multivariable meta-regression analysis on all of the treatment arms, beta-blocker treatment was a significant and negative predictor of the regression (-3.6%; P<0.01), but this was not the case for the other drug classes, including angiotensin receptor blockers. In conclusion, beta-blockers show less regression of left ventricular mass, whereas angiotensin receptor blockers may induce larger regression. The inferiority of beta-blockers appears to be more convincing than the superiority of angiotensin receptor blockers.", 
    "113": "Emerging new research suggests that the functions of the angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor are regulated in a complex manner. AT(1) receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) has been reported to reduce AT(1) receptor signaling with enhancement of AT(1) receptor internalization and to regulate the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. We examined the possibility that ATRAP could attenuate AT(1) receptor-mediated vascular senescence via inactivation with the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. Ang II stimulation significantly increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal)-stained cells, oxidative stress, and expression of p53 and p21 in wild-type (WT) vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Moreover, in WT VSMC, Ang II stimulation enhanced NFAT transcriptional activity, which was prevented by CAML-siRNA treatment. NFAT-siRNA treatment attenuated Ang-II-increased SA-beta-gal activity and p53 and p21 expression. Treatment with a calcineurin activity inhibitor, cyclosporin A, reduced Ang-II-induced NFAT transcriptional activity and senescent VSMC. In contrast, VSMC prepared from ATRAP transgenic (ATRAP-Tg) mice exhibited attenuation of Ang-II-induced SA-beta-gal activity, oxidative stress, NFAT transcriptional activity, and expression of p53 and p21. Moreover, ATRAP-Tg VSMC showed a more reduction of Ang-II-induced NFAT transcriptional activity by CAML-siRNA treatment than WT VSMC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in ATRAP-Tg VSMC, NFAT activity and senescent cells induced by ultraviolet irradiation were decreased compared with those in WT VSMC. Treatment with an AT(1) receptor blocker, valsartan, blocked these senescent cells but did not change NFAT activity in both cells. These results suggest that ATRAP negatively regulates VSMC senescence by reducing AT(1) receptor signaling, and that ATRAP-mediated inactivation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway could be at least partly involved in prevention of VSMC senescence, irrespective of AT(1) receptor blockade in some conditions.", 
    "114": "1. Abnormalities of cardiac autonomic regulation are a potential mechanism for morbidity despite blood pressure (BP) lowering in hypertension. Analysis of short-term (5 min) heart rate variability (HRV) provides a non-invasive probe of autonomic regulation of sino-atrial (SA) node automaticity. 2. We hypothesized that antihypertensive drug therapy would be associated with an increase in 5 min overall HRV, along with a decrease in blood pressure (BP), at 8 weeks follow up in subjects with newly diagnosed, never-treated essential hypertension. 3. One hundred and fifty patients (84 men and 66 women; mean (+/-SD) age 48 +/- 10 years) with newly diagnosed essential hypertension were divided to five groups of 30 patients each to receive one of the following antihypertensive drugs (or drug combinations): 5 mg/day amlodipine; 50 mg/day atenolol; 5 mg/day enalapril; 25 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide; or a combination of 5 mg/day amlodipine and 50 mg/day atenolol. 4. The only significant change in HRV indices was an increase in total variability of RR intervals and an increase in high-frequency (HF) RR interval spectral power in the amlodipine + atenolol-treated group (P < 0.05). 5. The results indicate that there is a dissociation between changes in short-term HRV and mean RR interval and BP lowering in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension. 6. We interpret the increase in HF RR interval spectral power in the amlodipine + atenolol-treated group as being due to an increase in vagal modulation of RR intervals and/or diminution in sympathetic restraint of respiratory sinus arrhythmia.",

Earlier it was empirically clear that in disease cases involving a high pressure, drug therapy will slow down the advancement of the disease. During the last ten years scientific evidence has accumulated indicating that a disease with normal pressure is also worth treating. Drug therapy can also postpone the onset of glaucoma at a time when intraocular pressure is high, yet without structural or functional damage.",

But, only such a fit is not the cause of the insomnia because it complains about the insomnia even if heart failure is slight. An obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the risk of the heart failure. A heart failure patient often complicates a central sleep apnea (CSA) and a Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR), and has much sleep fragmentation and difficulty maintaining sleep. And sleep disorders are sometimes started by the medications such as the cardiovascular system agent thing; beta blocker and the statins. Sleep disorders represent a major challenge in terms of differential diagnosis in heart failure patients. This is particularly relevant to insomnia and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) such as OSA, CSA and CSR. Thus, expending the knowledge on both insomnia and SDB may contribute to improve medical quality among physician.",

The increases in myogenic tone after iberiotoxin treatment were demonstrated as a decrease in microvessel internal diameter. No significant differences in BK(Ca) protein levels were noted comparing pre- and post-CPB conditions judged by immunoblot and by immunofluorescence staining of skeletal muscle microvessels.

The electrophoretic separation is achieved in less than 10 min and is based on the use of CEofix kit, for the dynamic capillary coating. The effects of accelerator buffer pH and separation voltage were investigated. The optimum buffer pH was found to be 2.5 for beta2-agonists and 6.2 for beta-blockers and phenoalkylamines with a separation voltage of 15 kV. Urine samples spiked with the compounds here studied were treated according to the standard procedure (SPE and evaporation to dryness) and analyzed by CE interfaced with an UV diode-array, set at 195 and 210 nm. The quantitative validation results, obtained analyzing samples at three different concentrations, show a good precision of peak areas that do not exceed 5% for intra-day assays and 10% for inter-day assays. Good linearity (r(2) > 0.995) was obtained within the 50-500 ng/mL concentration range. The qualitative validation data show a relative migration times (MTs) variation lower than 1%.

    "130": "4-aminopyridine (4-AP) is commonly used to block the transient outward potassium current, I(to), in cardiac and noncardiac tissues. In the present work, we found that 4-AP inhibited the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, I(Kr), in rabbit-isolated sinoatrial node myocytes by 25% (1 mM) and 51% (5 mM) and inhibited the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, I(Ks), in cat- isolated sinoatrial node myocytes by 39% (1 mM) and 62% (5 mM). In cat- and rabbit-isolated sinoatrial node myocytes, 4-AP activated muscarinic receptors in a voltage-dependent manner to increase the acetylcholine-activated potassium current, I(KACh). In multicellular preparations of the central region of the sinoatrial node from nonreserpinized rabbits, 4-AP produced an increase in action potential overshoot, frequency, and rate of diastolic depolarization. In the presence of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, 4-AP produced a marked increase in duration and a marked decrease in maximum diastolic potential and eventually, cessation of the spontaneous activity in preparations from the sinoatrial central region. In multicellular preparations from reserpinized rabbits, 4-AP produced similar effects to those observed in the presence of propranolol. We conclude that 4-AP inhibits multiple cardiac K(+) currents, including I(to), I(Kr), and I(Ks), and that these activities mask I(KACh) activation. In addition, in multicellular preparations, 4-AP produces neurotransmitter release from the autonomic nerve terminals. These multiple effects need to be considered when using 4-AP as a \"specific\" I(to) blocker.",

Although diabetic nephropathy may occur both in type 1 and in type 2 diabetes, some differences can be observed in the clinical picture according to the type of diabetes. In the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, the pathomechanism of hypertension can be explained by the concept of the metabolic syndrome. In order to avoid or decrease target organ damage, the goal of antihypertensive treatment in diabetes mellitus is to be set at <130/80 mmHg. The initial antihypertensive therapy is usually based on the evaluation of the global cardiovascular risk. Apart from modifying nutrition and lifestyle, pharmacological treatment with combination of antihypertensive drugs is generally required in order to achieve treatment goal. Diabetic or antidiabetic properties of antihypertensive drugs and antihypertensive characteristics of some antidiabetic drugs should be considered in the everyday clinical practice.",

They were formerly known as strawberry hemangiomas in reason of its typical appearance although uncommon morphologic variations can be found. Usually hemangiomas are harmless growths that are the result of proliferation of endothelial cells during early childhood. Involution of the lesion occurs at 12-18 months and can last up to 7 years. Occasionally, infantile hemangiomas suffer dramatic overgrowth causing esthetical damages, as well compromises to vital structures that requires prompt intervention. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that was invented by Sir James Black in 1960s, appears to be an effective treatment for infantile hemangiomas and should now be used as a first-line treatment in hemangiomas when intervention is required. Keloids (that resembles crab claws) and hypertrophic scars are fibrous tissue outgrowths that result from a derailment in the normal wound-healing process. Systemic or intralesional propranolol may play a role in the amelioration of keloids and hypertrophic scars due to their potential to induce vasoconstriction of over proliferating tissues, triggering apoptosis of endothelial cells and also to their effect as modulator of inflammatory process during wound healing. In adding the propranolol to the melting pot of abnormal (or supra-normal) wound healing, we hypothesized that we can battle keloids with propranolol.",

PPN-MAS dispersions at different pHs were prepared and characterized. The physicochemical properties and in vitro drug release of the complexes were also examined. Incorporation of PPN into MAS dispersions at various pHs caused the formation of PPN-MAS flocculates with a different particle size, zeta potential and amount of PPN adsorbed. The PPN-MAS complexes prepared at various pHs were formed via cation exchange, hydrogen bonding and water bridging mechanisms, which were revealed by FTIR and solid-state (29)Si NMR spectroscopy. This led to the intercalation of PPN molecules into the silicate layers of MAS. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated that the kinetic release of PPN can be described using the particle diffusion controlled mechanism, suggesting that drug release was controlled by diffusion of the drug in aqueous channels in the particle matrix of the complexes. The PPN-MAS complexes provided a sustained-release of PPN after an initial burst release in acidic medium and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer when compared with the physical mixture and pure PPN powder. This was due to a slow diffusion of drug that was intercalated in the inside of the particle matrix. The preparation pH of the complexes did not influence the release of PPN; the important factors affecting drug release were particle size, percentage of drug loaded in the complexes and the type of release medium. This finding suggests that the PPN-MAS complexes obtained in this study are strong candidates for use as drug carriers in oral modified-release dosage forms.",

Lipid enriched non-calcified lesions are considered more instable and rupture prone than calcified lesions. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular matrix degrading enzymes with plaque destabilisating characteristics which have been implicated in atherogenesis. We therefore hypothesised MMP-1 and MMP-9 serum levels to be associated with non-calcified lesions as determined by CT-angiography in patients with coronary artery disease.",

Other beta-blockers have been found to be inferior (metoprolol tartrate) or have not been studied (atenolol). The authors compared all-cause mortality following treatment with either atenolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol tartrate for 974 patients with left ventricular function < or =40%. The unadjusted mortality at 6 months was lower with atenolol (3.2%) and carvedilol (4.2%) when compared with metoprolol tartrate (7.5%, P< or =.039). However, patients with atenolol were older but had less prior heart failure. After adjustment for the propensity to be treated with atenolol, patients actually treated with atenolol had a significantly lower risk of death compared with treatment with metoprolol tartrate and comparable outcome to those treated with carvedilol. These results suggest that atenolol may be useful for patients with heart failure treatment and highlight the need for a randomized trial comparing atenolol with established beta-blockers.",

    "169": "Stretch induces modifications in myocardial electrical and mechanical activity. Besides the effects of substances that block the stretch-activated channels, other substances could modulate the effects of stretch through different mechanisms that affect Ca(2+) handling by myocytes. Thirty-six Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were used to analyze the effects of the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger blocker KB-R7943, propranolol, and the adenosine A(2) receptor antagonist SCH-58261 on the acceleration of ventricular fibrillation (VF) produced by acute myocardial stretching. VF recordings were obtained with two epicardial multiple electrodes before, during, and after local stretching in four experimental series: control (n = 9), KB-R7943 (1 microM, n = 9), propranolol (1 microM, n = 9), and SCH-58261 (1 microM, n = 9). Both the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger blocker KB-R7943 and propranolol induced a significant reduction (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05, respectively) in the dominant frequency increments produced by stretching with respect to the control and SCH-58261 series (control = 49.9%, SCH-58261 = 52.1%, KB-R7943 = 9.5%, and propranolol = 12.5%). The median of the activation intervals, the functional refractory period, and the wavelength of the activation process during VF decreased significantly under stretch in the control and SCH-58261 series, whereas no significant variations were observed in the propranolol and KB-R7943 series, with the exception of a slight but significant decrease in the median of the fibrillation intervals in the KB-R7943 series. KB-R7943 and propranolol induced a significant reduction in the activation maps complexity increment produced by stretch with respect to the control and SCH-58261 series. In conclusion, the electrophysiological effects responsible for stretch-induced VF acceleration in the rabbit heart are reduced by the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger blocker KB-R7943 and by propranolol but not by the adenosine A(2) receptor antagonist SCH-58261.", 
    "170": "The aim of this study was to better understand the importance of the \"microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume\" ratio during in vitro drug release measurements from PLGA microparticles. Initially porous/non-porous, ibuprofen/lidocaine/propranolol HCl-loaded systems were exposed to phosphate buffer pH 7.4 in agitated test tubes, varying the microparticle concentration from 5:1 to 20:1mg:mL. Interestingly, drug release was virtually unaffected by the \"microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume\" ratio in the case of initially porous, ibuprofen-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete drug release within about 1 week. Optical microscopy, SEM, DSC and pH measurements of the bulk fluid revealed no major impact of the microparticle concentration on the systems' properties within the first couple of days. However, a more rapid and pronounced decrease in the pH of the release medium occurred after 10-14 d at elevated \"microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume\" ratios. This resulted in an accelerated: (i) decrease in the glass transition temperature, (ii) microparticle agglomeration, and (iii) increase in the internal and external microparticle porosity. Importantly, this phenomenon did not significantly affect drug release from initially porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles, exhibiting complete release within about 18 d. In contrast, drug release became significantly faster at higher \"microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume\" ratios in the case of initially non-porous, lidocaine-loaded microparticles and initially porous, propranolol HCl-loaded systems, exhibiting complete release after 1 and 2 months, respectively. Thus, depending on the type of system, the \"microparticle mass:bulk fluid volume\" ratio may or may not affect the observed release kinetics in vitro. This should be carefully taken into account when defining the experimental conditions for drug release measurements from this type of advanced drug delivery systems.", 
    "171": "The study objective was to evaluate levels of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 and of leptin, and then to determine the relationship between these levels and clinical responses in children with migraine after prophylactic therapy with one of four drugs. In all, 77 children who needed prophylactic drugs were treated with cyproheptadine, amitriptyline, propranolol, or flunarizine. Serum levels of the cytokines and leptin were measured before and 4 months after the treatment. Results were compared by drug for headache frequency, severity, and duration, the PedMIDAS score, and levels of each cytokine and of leptin. Each of the four drugs not only decreased the frequency and duration but also the severity of headache, and the PedMIDAS score. None of the drugs was found to be superior to others in terms of reduction in cytokine levels (P > 0.05). Both cyproheptadine and flunarizine (but not amitriptyline and propranolol) caused an increase in leptin levels (P < 0.05). These data suggest that cytokine levels are related to clinical responses, and might help in objective evaluation of clinical response in migraine. To our knowledge, the present study is the first trial to compare the effects of prophylactic drugs, cytokine levels, and leptin levels in children with migraine.",

The two most harmful consequences of AEs were irreversible physical damage (n=3) and early death (n=8). Sixty percent (n=9) of systemic AEs were heart-related.

Significant correlations between prescription of beta-blockers and antiplatelet agents and prevention of AEs were observed. A persistent focus on the prevention of systemic AEs in order to ameliorate the outcome after LEAR for limb salvage remains of utmost importance. Therefore, we advise the implementation of an optimized care protocol by discussing patients in a strict manner according to a predetermined protocol, to optimize and standardize the preoperative work-up as well as intra- and postoperative patient surveillance.", 
    "176": "An isoindolin-1-one derivate, JM-1232(-), was recently developed as a sedative and hypnotic agent with a strong affinity for the central benzodiazepine binding site of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of JM-1232(-) on the cardiovascular and sympathetic functions of conscious rats. We investigated the effect of JM-1232(-) on the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), baroreflex activity, and plasma catecholamine levels in conscious rats. The intravenous (i.v.) administration of JM-1232(-) (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg/min) for 20 min decreased MAP and increased HR in intact rats. In sinoaortic denervated (SAD) rats, JM-1232(-) decreased MAP and HR. A decrease in MAP induced by JM-1232(-) was prevented by pre-treatment with hexamethonium and enhanced by SAD. An increase in HR induced by JM-1232(-) was prevented by pre-treatment with atropine, propranolol, or hexamethonium. A decrease in MAP and an increase in HR induced by JM-1232(-) were antagonized by co-administration of flumazenil. A high dose of JM-1232(-) decreased the plasma norepinephrine concentration, and a subdepressor dose of JM-1232(-) did not affect the baroreceptor reflex. These results show that the i.v. administration of JM-1232(-) decreased MAP mediated by benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "177": "Carvedilol is widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation. T-type Ca(2+) channels have been recognized recently in the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmias. However, it is unclear whether carvedilol may affect the T-type Ca(2+) channel. The present study evaluated the pharmacological effects of carvedilol on T-type calcium current (I(Ca,T)) in the murine HL-1 cell line. I(Ca)(,T) was recorded by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Calcium transient was monitored by the fluorescent dye Fluo-4/AM and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Carvedilol reversibly inhibited I(Ca)(,T) in a concentration-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 2.1 microM. 3 microM carvedilol was found to decrease the peak I(Ca)(,T) amplitude at -20 mV from 20.1+/-1.8pA/pF to 10.9+/-2.1pA/pF. Carvedilol significantly shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ca)(,T) towards more negative potential by 12.8 mV, while the activation curve was not significantly altered. Carvedilol delayed recovery from inactivation of I(Ca)(,T), time constant (tau) was 112.4+/-3.5 ms in control and 270.1+/-4.7 ms in carvedilol. Carvedilol-induced inhibition rate in I(Ca)(,T) was enhanced with the increase in stimuli frequency, the inhibitory rate was 23.2+/-4.1% at 0.2 Hz and 47.2+/-0.6% at 2 Hz. Carvedilol still produced the significant decrease in the amplitude of I(Ca)(,T) in the presence of H-89, PKA inhibitor. Carvedilol significantly inhibited the amplitude of the calcium transient in a concentration-dependent manner. These findings indicate that carvedilol inhibits I(Ca)(,T) in atrial cells by mechanisms involving preferential interaction with the inactivated state of T-type Ca(2+) channel.", 
    "178": "Regression adjustment for the propensity score is a statistical method that reduces confounding from measured variables in observational data. A Bayesian propensity score analysis extends this idea by using simultaneous estimation of the propensity scores and the treatment effect. In this article, we conduct an empirical investigation of the performance of Bayesian propensity scores in the context of an observational study of the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure patients. We study the balancing properties of the estimated propensity scores. Traditional Frequentist propensity scores focus attention on balancing covariates that are strongly associated with treatment. In contrast, we demonstrate that Bayesian propensity scores can be used to balance the association between covariates and the outcome. This balancing property has the effect of reducing confounding bias because it reduces the degree to which covariates are outcome risk factors.",
