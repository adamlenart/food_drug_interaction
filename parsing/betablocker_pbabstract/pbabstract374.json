    "0": "Isolated equine digital veins (EDVs) were used to study beta-adrenoceptor mediated vasodilation and to examine isoxsuprine's vasodilatory mechanism of action. When the blood vessel wall tension was raised with potassium chloride solution (KCl; 59 mmol/l), the order of vasodilator potency of beta-agonists was: isoprenaline > fenoterol > noradrenaline > dobutamine > isoxsuprine. The beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 (1 nmol/l) caused a 6.74 and 6.65-fold parallel shift to the right in the dose response curves to fenoterol and noradrenaline respectively. Propranolol (10 nmol/l) inhibited the vasodilatory action of isoprenaline in a competitive manner (19.6 +/- 6.4-fold parallel shift to the right) but was much less effective as an inhibitor of isoxsuprine's vasodilatory action. Isoprenaline and fenoterol were just as effective as vasodilators when blood vessel wall tension was raised with KCl, the thromboxanemimetic U44069 (9, 11-dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-epoxymethano-prostaglandin F2 alpha; 30 nmol/l) or the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (0.3 mumol/l). In addition, fenoterol's relaxation of U44069-induced tone was competitively inhibited by the beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (8.4 +/- 0.9-fold parallel shift to the right). By contrast, isoxsuprine was 81.9 times more potent as a vasorelaxant of phenylephrine-induced tone when compared with KCl-induced tone and proved completely ineffective as a vasodilator of U44069-induced tone. When dose response curves to alpha-adrenoceptor vasoconstrictor agonists were obtained in the presence of isoxsuprine (0.1 mumol/l), competitive antagonism occurred with methoxamine and noncompetitive antagonism with BHT-920. These data suggest EDVs possess beta 2-adrenoceptors mediating vasodilation. Isoxsuprine is an alpha 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist but has very low potency and efficacy as a beta-adrenoceptor agonist in this functional bioassay. Indeed, much of the vasodilatory action of isoxsuprine may be due to a mechanism which does not involve beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "1": "The effects of the serotonin1A(5-HT1A) receptor agonist buspirone on hypoglycemia elicited by tolbutamide were investigated in rats. Buspirone, at doses not affecting plasma glucose levels, inhibited the hypoglycemic effects of tolbutamide. The inhibitory effects of buspirone on tolbutamide-induced hypoglycemia were antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist pindolol. As tolbutamide is known to induce hypoglycemia by facilitating insulin release, the effects of buspirone on a tolbutamide-induced increase in serum insulin levels were also studied. However, buspirone did not affect tolbutamide-induced insulin release. Adrenodemedullation inhibited the effects of buspirone. These results suggest that buspirone inhibits tolbutamide-induced hypoglycemia mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, and adrenaline release may be involved in the effects of buspirone.", 
    "2": "The effects of exercise training on the pharmacokinetics of orally administered propranolol were studied in young and elderly healthy volunteers. Twenty-three young (30 +/- 5 years of age) and 20 elderly (67 +/- 5 years of age) adults were randomly assigned to endurance training (N = 12 young subjects, 10 elderly subjects) or nonexercising control (N = 11 young subjects, 10 elderly subjects) groups. Training consisted of treadmill walking, stair climbing, or both three times per week for 40 minutes at 70-85% of maximal heart rate reserve for 16 weeks. Resting plasma propranolol concentrations after a single dose of 80 mg of oral propranolol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, and estimated hepatic blood flow measured was measured using indocyanine green during supine test. Aerobic training increased maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) by 13% and 14% in the exercising young and elderly groups, respectively. There was no change in VO2 max in either control group. Adjusted mean estimated hepatic blood flow after exercise corrected for body weight for the young subjects who did not exercise (15.6 mL/min/Kg) and those who did (18.2 mL/min/Kg) groups were of borderline significance. No statistical differences were detected in the experimental propranolol pharmacokinetic parameters (maximal concentration, time of maximal concentration, terminal half-life, area under the curve, and protein binding) or derived pharmacokinetic parameters (intrinsic clearance, bioavailability, clearance, and volume of distribution). These results provide evidence that changes in aerobic fitness do not produce corresponding changes in propranolol pharmacokinetics in young or elderly adults.", 
    "3": "We examined whether norepinephrine at pharmacologically relevant doses induces increased expression of c-fos mRNA in rat aortic rings. c-fos mRNA was expressed at norepinephrine concentrations known to cause minimum and maximum contraction of rat aorta in vitro. At the concentration known to cause maximum contraction, norepinephrine produced a marked and sustained increase of c-fos mRNA expression. Induction of c-fos was blocked completely by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin, partially by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, and not at all by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. A prazosin inhibition curve showed that 1 nmol/L prazosin inhibited 10 micromol/L norepinephrine induced c-fos expression by 40%. At the pharmacologic dose known to cause maximum contraction, norepinephrine induces c-fos mRNA expression through the alpha-adrenoceptor in rat aortic rings.", 
    "4": "The study was performed to examine the responses to catecholamines in vas deferens isolated from rats submitted to acute swimming-induced stress. It was demonstrated that acute stress induces a significant subsensitivity of rat vas deferens to norepinephrine. This subsensitivity was inhibited when the experiment was carried out in the presence of either cocaine (10-5 M) or timolol (10-5 M). On the other hand, the rat vas deferens sensitivity to methoxamine was significantly increased by acute swimming-induced stress. Thus, despite acute swimming stress inducing a reduction in response to norepinephrine, the alpha1-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile response was increased. Additionally there were increases in neuronal uptake and beta2-adrenoceptor activity that opposes the alpha1-adrenoceptor activity. Integrated, these phenomena are responsible for the rat vas deferens subsensitivity to norepinephrine which may be involved in body homeostasis in stressogenic situations.", 
    "5": "A prospective double blind cross over study compared the anti-ischemic effect of 20 mg of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN), 60 mg of diltiazem and 100 mg of metoprolol by performing serial treadmill tests (TMTs) following oral administration of single dose of each drug in 28 patients of ischemic heart disease with positive exercise TMT. The anti-ischemic effect of IS-5-MN, diltiazem and metoprolol was evaluated by assessing the time to onset of ischemia (400.8 +/- 41.1 vs 394.1 +/- 36.0 vs 412.7 +/- 36.6 secs respectively, all p > or = 0.05), duration of ischemia (390.9 +/- 58.5 vs 447.6 +/- 65.9 vs 419.4 +/- 58.7 secs respectively, all p > or = 0.05), duration of exercise 464.0 +/- 32.9 vs 476.8 +/- 32.5 vs 502.6 +/- 31.3 secs respectively, all p > or = 0.05) and severity of ischemia by scoring system (10.0 +/- 1.5 vs 10.7 +/- 1.4 vs 9.8 +/- 1.5 respectively, all p > or = 0.05). Thus, the present study suggests that there is no significant difference in the anti-ischemic effect of IS-5-MN, diltiazem and metoprolol and also suggests that the anti-ischemic effect of metoprolol is primarily by decreasing the heart rate while IS-5-MN and diltiazem exert anti-ischemic effect probably by decreasing oxygen demand and improving coronary blood flow.",

    "11": "A stereoselective method, involving a single liquid-liquid extraction step, was developed and validated for the analysis of nadolol in human plasma. The assay involved extraction of nadolol and desmethyl-nadolol (as internal standard (IS)) from alkalinized plasma into dichloromethane. The organic solvent was separated and evaporated under nitrogen at 40 degrees C. A chiral derivatization scheme with (R)-(-)-napthylethylisocyanate (50 microL of 0.1% solution in dichloromethane for 60 min) was employed to convert the enantiomers of nadolol into the corresponding diastereomeric derivatives. The residue was reconstituted in the mobile phase and injected onto a C-18 column. The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol:tetrahydrofuran:water (52:7:41 by vol) containing about 0.001% v/v of both phosphoric acid and tetramethylethylenediamine. Fluorimetric detection was performed at excitation 230 and emission 330 nm. The assay was specific for the enantiomers of nadolol and the lower limit of quantitation was 2 ng/mL for each of the enantiomers. Analysis of quality control samples resulted in precision estimates of 7% RSD for inter-assay and 10.1% RSD for intra-assay and the predicted concentrations deviated less than 9.4% of the nominal values for the four enantiomers. The extraction recoveries of the individual enantiomer was about 70%. Stability of nadolol enantiomers were established for four freeze/thaw cycle periods and in the autosampler at 5 degrees C for at least 116 h.",

There was a small reduction in the sensitivity to isoprenaline and a marked reduction in the maximum attenuation of hypertension caused by isoprenaline. The sensitivity and efficacy of sodium nitroprusside and verapamil were not altered by hypertension. BAAM and ICI 147798 inhibited the isoprenaline responses and reduced the maximum attenuation to isoprenaline. In the WKY rat portal vein the dissociation constant (KA) values for isoprenaline were independent of BAAM concentration, and was 1.78 +/- 0.32 x 10(-7) mol/l. Similar isoprenaline KA values were obtained from the ICI 147798 data and in the SHR portal vein. In the WKY rat portal vein, from the BAAM data, it was calculated that isoprenaline produced 50, 95 and 100% maximum responses by occupying 6 +/- 1, 20 +/- 3 and 43 +/- 5% (n = 21) of the available beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively. Similar occupancy-response relationships were obtained in the WKY rat portal vein from the ICI 147798 data. At each level of isoprenaline response the receptor reserve was significantly smaller in the SHR than it was in the WKY rat portal vein. Thus, from the BAAM data, isoprenaline produced 50, 95 and 100% maximum responses by occupying 14 +/- 3, 33 +/- 6 and 58 +/- 7% (n = 15) of the available SHR portal vein beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively.",

The beta-receptor antagonist propranolol and Ca2+ channel blocker ispotin could reverse the effects of BR on single Ca2+ channel, suggesting that (1) BR works as a Ca2+ channel agonist; (2) the regulating effects of BR on single Ca2+ channel is depending upon the phosphorylation process induced by beta-receptor activity.", 
    "22": "Venom isolated from the stonefish Synanceia verrucosa was assayed in concentrations of 0.07 and 5.7 micrograms/ml on frog atrial fibres and myocytes. Venom, less than 2.9 micrograms/ml, dose-dependently increased the amplitude and the duration of the stimulated peak tension, lengthened the time constant of the relaxation phase and shortened the duration of the action potential (AP). The concentration of venom 5.7 micrograms/ml decreased the amplitude of the peak tension, induced a contracture, reduced the amplitude of the plateau and shortened its duration as well as the repolarizing phase of the AP. The positive inotropic effect induced by the venom (2.9 micrograms/ml) on the contraction was inhibited dose-dependently by propranolol but was unchanged by the alpha-adrenergic antagonists urapidil and yohimbine, the adenyl cyclase activity remaining sensitive to forskolin. Venom, adrenalin and propranolol competed for a common site. Venom (2.9 micrograms/ml) increased both the Ca and the delayed outward K currents of enzymatically isolated atrial myocytes. The data suggest that the venom activates adrenoceptors, essentially beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "23": "Elementary K+ currents through cardiac 66 pS outwardly-rectifying K+ channels isolated from cultured neonatal rat cardiocytes were recorded in the inside-out patch configuration. By analyzing the influence of inhibitory sulfonamide derivatives, the block phenomenology evoked by these class III antiarrhythmic drugs was studied. After isolation from their cellular environment, K+(outw.-rect.) channels became usually upregulated so that open probability increased with time to reach, within 3 min or longer, a several-fold enhanced steady state level. Nevertheless, the novel sulfonamide derivative HE93 (10-100 mumol/l) depressed NPo significantly within some hundred milliseconds on cytosolic administration with a calculated IC50 value of 38 mumol/l. Drug-induced channel blockade mainly emerged from an increased life time of the prolonged C2-state; tau closed (2) rose (at 100 mumol/l) to 269 +/- 20%. A C1-C2 reaction scheme can adequately describe closed time kinetics in the presence of HE93 but the occurrence of a specific, drug-evoked ultralong (< or = 60 ms) C-state and mainly underlying the NPo depression cannot be excluded. Sotalol (100 mumol/l) caused the same block phenomenology although a 2.6-fold larger IC50 value (half maximal inhibitory concentration) suggests a smaller potency to depress channel activity. Despite a close structural relationship with the both compounds HE93 and sotalol, glibenclamide (100 mumol/l) exerted no significant inhibitory influence (IC50 = 530 mumol/l) on K+ channel activity. Instead, this sulfonylurea interfered with open K+ channels with an association rate constant of 8.2 +/- 3.8 x 10(6) mol-1 s-1 to shorten their 0-state, as a sign of open channel blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The inhibitory effect of BIMT 17 on the firing rate of neurons in the frontal cortex was antagonized by the 5-HT1A antagonists tertatolol and WAY 100135, and was still present after destruction of serotonin (5-HT) containing neuronal endings by the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 150 micrograms/rat, given intraventricularly), which reduced the cortical 5-HT content by 85%. This destruction of 5-HT neurons, while suppressing the ability of 8-OH-DPAT to inhibit the firing rate at high doses, did not change the excitatory action of this compound at low doses. The addition of ritanserin, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, potentiated both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT on neuronal electrical activity. Direct microiontophoretic application (100 nA/20 s) of 5-HT and BIMT 17, but not that of 8-OH-DPAT, onto medial prefronto-cortical neurons, decreased the firing rate of these neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The present study deals with the identification of 5-HT1D receptors inhibiting cyclic AMP accumulation in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. 5-HT (1 nM-10 microM) induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the cyclic AMP accumulation stimulated by prostaglandin E1 (1 microM) in MDCK cells. The maximal effect of 5-HT averaged 50% inhibition and was abolished after a pre-treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin.

Rats were anesthetized, artificially ventilated, and the thorax opened by a left thoracotomy. Ischemia was induced by left coronary artery ligation, and reperfusion was achieved (after a 5-min period of ischemia) in a separate group of rats by removing the ligature. Agents were given intravenously 5 min before occlusion or orally 4 h before study. During a 20-min period of ischemia, SR 33589 reduced significantly the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) from 80 to 30% (p < 0.05) at 3 mg/kg i.v. and eliminated VF and mortality at 10 mg/kg i.v. In contrast, amiodarone at 10 mg/kg i.v. reduced significantly only the incidence of mortality during ischemia (from 60 to 0%, p < 0.01), while having no significant effect on 3 mg/kg i.v.

Tilisolol and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextrans (average molecular weights 4400 and 9400 Da; FD-4 and FD-10, respectively) were used as model penetrants of ophthalmic beta-blockers and peptide drugs. Preservatives significantly enhanced the corneal penetration of not only tilisolol but also FITC-dextrans. Especially, benzalkonium chloride increased the corneal permeability of FD-4 and FD-10 by 28.8 and 37.1 times, respectively. These results indicate the usefulness of ophthalmic preservatives as absorption promoters for the ocular delivery of beta-blockers and hydrophilic macromolecules. Preservatives also enhanced the conjunctival permeability of tilisolol, FD-4 and FD-10. The promoting effect of preservatives on the conjunctival drug penetration was smaller than that on the corneal one. Preservative increased the ratio of corneal to conjunctival permeability of tilisolol, FD-4 and FD-10. The different responses of corneal and conjunctival drug penetrations to ophthalmic preservatives may be useful to control the extent and pathway for the ocular and systemic absorptions of instilled drugs.",

    "50": "Repetitive oral administration of imipramine (100 mg/kg/day for 5 days) caused a decrease in rat liver microsomal debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase activity, a characteristic reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D1. Other CYP2D-dependent reactions (such as bunitrolol 4-hydroxylation, lidocaine 3-hydroxylation, and propranolol 4-, 5- and 7-hydroxylations) were also impaired by the treatment, but not those catalyzed by other CYP isozymes. Imipramine pretreatment did not change the immunochemically determined content of the CYP2D protein, suggesting that CYP2D is inactivated. Imipramine pretreatment also resulted in an increase in total CYP content and in formation of a ferrous CYP metabolic intermediate (MI)-complex absorbing at 454 nm. Although the total CYP content was increased by the treatment of these microsomes with ferricyanide to dissociate the MI-complex, the CYP2D-dependent activities were not restored, suggesting that the MI-complex was not the primary cause of CYP2D inhibition. This pretreatment regimen caused marked increases in immunochemically determined levels of CYP2A1, CYP2B1, CYP2B2, CYP2C6, and CYP3A2, and in the activities of 2 alpha-, 2 beta-, 6 beta-, 7 alpha-, 16 alpha-, and 16 beta-hydroxylation and 17-oxidation of testosterone. These results indicate that imipramine has two actions on the liver CYP system (i.e. as an inhibitor of the CYP2D enzyme and as a phenobarbital-type inducer).",

The relative proportions of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were determined by radioligand binding studies in three different rat myocardial preparations: membranes prepared from rat ventricle (ventricular membranes), membranes prepared from rat isolated ventricular myocytes (myocyte membranes), and myocytes isolated from rat ventricle (myocytes). 2. Competition experiments using CGP 20712A or ICI 118,551 with [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-ICYP) revealed high- and low-affinity binding sites in ventricular membranes. The concentration at which each beta-antagonist occupied 100% of its high-affinity binding sites was 300 nM for CGP 20712A (beta 1-adrenoceptor) and 50 nM for ICI 118,551 (beta 2-adrenoceptor). 3. The density of high-affinity (beta 1-adrenoceptor) and low-affinity (beta 2-adrenoceptor) binding sites for CGP 20712A was measured by a saturation experiment using [125I]-ICYP in the presence and absence of 300 nM CGP 20712A. In ventricular membranes, the proportions of high-affinity and low-affinity binding sites for CGP 20712A were 73% and 27%, respectively, whereas in myocyte membranes, the corresponding figures were 90% and 10%, respectively. The density of low-affinity binding sites for CGP 20712A in ventricular membranes, defined as [125I]-ICYP-specific binding in the presence of 300 nM CGP 20712A, was decreased by addition of 50 nM ICI 118,551, whereas that in myocyte membranes was not affected. 4. In myocytes, specific binding of [125I]-ICYP and [3H]-CGP 12177 was not detected by saturation experiments performed in the presence of 300 nM CGP 20712A. 5 In myocytes, the activation of adenylate cyclase caused by beta2-adrenoceptors was not detected in the presence of 10 nM, 100 nM or 1000 nM CGP 20712A, which selectively antagonized beta1-adrenoceptors.Furthermore, the concentration-response curve for isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation was not shifted by 10 nm or 100 nM ICI 118,551, which selectively antagonized beta2-adrenoceptors, but was shifted to the right by 1000 nM ICI 118,551.6 These results indicate that beta2-adrenoceptors are not present on rat ventricular myocytes and that beta2-adrenoceptor stimulation does not cause any detectable production of cyclic AMP. We conclude that only beta1-adrenoceptors exist on rat ventricular myocytes.",

The effects of formoterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on plasma protein exudation and microvascular permeability induced by topical, i.e. applied onto the tracheal mucosal surface, bradykinin (10 nmol; 20 microM, 5 min, 0.1 ml min-1) were studied in a perfused segment of trachea prepared in situ in anaesthetized rats. 2. Bradykinin increased the amount of plasma (fluorimetric assay for protein) in the perfusate (response; 10.98 +/- 0.357 microliters, n = 69; total increase in plasma over basal during 45 min after start of bradykinin application) and 2 responses at a 90 min interval were reproducible. Carbon labelling was seen in tracheal sections from animals that received i.v. colloidal carbon, indicating that bradykinin caused tracheal microvessels to leak (increase in microvascular permeability). 3. Five minutes after topical formoterol, 5 or 30 nmol (10 or 60 microM perfused for 5 min), the bradykinin response was significantly reduced. The effects of formoterol were not dose-related, i.e. were maximal at 5 nmol. The bradykinin response was at control levels 30 min after 5 nmol formoterol. After 30 nmol formoterol, the response was still reduced 120 min later. The bradykinin response was significantly reduced 60 min after systemic formoterol (i.p., 0.029 to 870 nmol kg-1) and, for 290 nmol kg-1 i.p. formoterol, this reduction was shown to last at least 150 min. 4 The bradykinin response was not prevented by supramaximal doses of topical (30 nmol) or i.p.(870 nmol kg-1) formoterol and carbon-labelled microvessels were seen in tracheal sections from all animals that received formoterol, although these were less in number and less densely labelled than in the absence of formoterol. There was a correlation between the plasma exudation response (ul) and the number of carbon-labelled vessels (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.415, P<0.001).5 In animals pretreated with propranolol (3 pmol kg-1, i.v.), 29 nmol kg-1 formoterol, i.p., did not reduce the bradykinin response. However, propranolol itself markedly potentiated the bradykinin response which confounded the interpretation of its effects on formoterol.6 The study has shown, in a preparation of rat trachea in situ, that supramaximal doses of the beta2-adrenoceptor agonist, formoterol (a) produced a sustained, but incomplete, inhibition of plasma exudation (induced by topical bradykinin), and (b) did not prevent bradykinin-induced leaky microvessels. The data support the view that, at least in rodent airways, beta2-adrenoceptor agonists attenuate, but do not abolish, the microvascular permeability effects of bradykinin, a putative asthma mediator.", 
    "53": "Bilateral striatectomy disorganized the rhythmical structure of forced swimming and circadian motility of rats. Destruction of dorsal but not ventral striatum eliminated the effect of beta-adrenoblocker propranolol on temporal organization of behaviour. The results suggest that just the dorsal striatum is mainly subjected to adrenergic control.", 
    "54": "The host response to infection is frequently accompanied by changes in lipid metabolism. Previous studies have shown that endotoxin (LPS), a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, increases serum lipid levels. In this study, we demonstrate that lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of the cell membrane of gram-positive bacteria, also increases serum lipid levels in rats in a dose-dependent manner (0.1-300 micrograms/200 g body weight). Serum triglyceride levels increased within 2 h after LTA administration with peak values at 4 h (2-fold increase). Serum cholesterol levels also increased but the effect was delayed occurring at 16 h and was relatively small (1.2-fold increase). LTA (10 micrograms/200 g BW) did not decrease adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity or the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Rather, the LTA-induced hypertriglyceridemia is due to an increase in hepatic triglyceride secretion. LTA stimulates both hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis and lipolysis. The increased delivery of free fatty acids to the liver plays a major role in the LTA-induced hypertriglyceridemia. Pretreatment with phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or phentolamine alone significantly suppressed the hypertriglyceridemia induced by LTA. These adrenergic inhibitors had no significant effect on the increase in lipolysis. These results indicate that catecholamines are involved in mediating the LTA-induced increase in hepatic triglyceride secretion via alpha-adrenergic receptors. These changes in lipid metabolism may play an important role in the organism's response to gram-positive infection.",

Groups were classified by HLA match, type of immunosuppression, prior cardiovascular history, type of antihypertensives (36 on calcium channel blockers, 32 on beta blockers, 8 ACE inhibitors). Events were defined as myocardial infarction, CVA, graft loss with return to dialysis, life-threatening sepsis, or death.",

Survivals were better when calcium channel blockers were used (mean 71.7 vs 38.6 months, p < 0.05; 4-year survival 84 vs 58%). When both beta and calcium channel blockers were used (n = 20), patients mean survival was 72.5 months vs 36.8 months for 21 patients who were not treated with blockers (p < 0.005). There was a lower incidence of graft loss when beta blockers and calcium channel blockers were used: at mean patient survival of 36.8 months, the no-blockers group had a mean graft survival of 19.3 months vs 72.5 months for blocker-treated patients (p < 0.002). Reinstitution of dialysis occurred less often with calcium channel blockers (17 vs 42%) or beta blockers (19 vs 38%) used either individually or together (5 vs 42%), all p < 0.05.

    "60": "Using microelectrode techniques, we investigated the electrophysiologic effects of cocaine on endocardial canine Purkinje fibers that survived 1 day of myocardial infarction. In quiescent infarcted preparations, stimulated trains were followed by subthreshold delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), in the presence of propranolol (1 microM). Cocaine (10 microM) decreased the amplitude of DADs from 6.1 +/- 1.8 mV to 3.0 +/- 1.3 mV (P < 0.05, n = 6). When stimulated preparations (n = 23) showing no triggered activity during control (+propranolol) were superfused with a low concentration of caffeine (1 mM) or high extracellular Ca2+ (8.1 mM), triggered activity was induced. Subsequent cocaine (10 microM) superfusion prevented the induction of caffeine- and high Ca(2+)-induced triggered activity. Cocaine's effects were reversible upon washout. In preparations that showed triggered activity during control conditions (+propranolol), the mean cycle length of triggered activity was 755 +/- 45 msec. Cocaine (10 microM) superfusion lengthened the cycle length to 1030 +/- 141 msec and terminated triggered activity with a subthreshold DAD (n = 12). In addition, cocaine and ryanodine (10 microM) suppressed triggered activity in a similar manner when tested in the same preparations (n = 4). During control conditions, cocaine did not cause any significant change on the rate of rise of action potential upstroke (from 55.6 +/- 24.3 to 54.5 +/- 28.6 V/sec, n = 8) and maximum diastolic potential (from -58.4 +/- 4.3 to -56.6 +/- 6.5 mV, n = 8). In the absence of propranolol, 50 microM but not 10 microM cocaine induced early afterdepolarizations in 62% of the preparations exhibiting triggered activity during control conditions.", 
    "61": "The results suggest that cocaine modulates DADs and triggered activity in infarcted endocardial fibers via direct inhibition of cyclic release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) independently from a local anesthetic or sympathomimetic effect. This SR inhibition could account for the myocardial depressant effect of cocaine. However, while cocaine suppressed DADs, its induction of EADs can precipitate malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of cocaine overdose and infarction.",

Therefore, the changes of haemostasis parameters in 22 patients with essential hypertension under long-term celiprolol therapy (> 2 months) were of interest. In the placebo group of 15 essentially hypertensive patients there were no significant changes in platelet activity. On the other hand, the therapeutic dose of celiprolol was shown to reduce total platelet aggregation, without any harmful effects on fibrinolytic activity and coagulation inhibitors such as protein C and antithrombin III. The metabolic neutrality of celiprolol accompanied by the proven platelet-inhibitory tendency is desirable in the new approach to hypertension treatment. Potentially anti-thrombotic or at least neutral prothrombotic properties of celiprolol may be important in terms of the favourable role of anti-hypertensive drugs in cardiovascular morbidity.",

However, the pharmacological mechanisms implicated in this effect remain unclear. 2. In this study, the possible participation of noradrenergic, serotonergic and benzodiazepine receptors on flunitrazepam-modified morphine withdrawal syndrome was investigated in mice. Flunitrazepam was associated to the noradrenergic antagonists prazosin (1 mg/kg) and propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), the serotonergic agents ritanserine (1 mg/kg) and p-chloro phenylalanine (600 mg/kg), the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg), and the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (5 mg/kg). 3. The decrease in jumping behavior-induced by flunitrazepam was potentiated by prazosin, while ritanserine, flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 blocked this effect. 4. Flunitrazepam-induced increase on wet dog shake frequency was partially reduced by flumazenil, and strongly antagonized by ritanserine and Ro 15-4513. 5. Noradrenergic and serotonergic systems seem to be primarily implicated in the changes induced on jumping and wet dog shakes respectively. These modifications are induced through the activation of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "68": "Application of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) induces a pulsed decrease in osteoclast intracellular pH (pHi), as measured with seminaphthofluorescein (SNAFL)-calcein on a laser scanning confocal microscope. Adenosine diphosphate also produces a pHi decrease, but adenosine monophosphate, uridine triphosphate, 2-methylthio-ATP, and beta, gamma-methylene-ATP have little effect on pHi. The ATP-induced pHi decrease is largely inhibited by suramin, a P2 purinergic receptor blocker. Clamping intracellular free [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) with BAPTA/AM does not affect the ATP-induced pHi change, showing that this pHi decrease is not caused by the increased intracellular [Ca2+]i that is produced by activation of osteoclast purinergic receptors. We show that an increase in [Ca2+]i by itself will produce a pHi increase. The ATP effect is not blocked by inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by either Na(+)-free bathing medium or amiloride. Two inhibitors of the osteoclast cell membrane proton pump, N-ethylmaleimide and vanadate, produce partial inhibition of the ATP-induced pHi decrease. Two other proton pump inhibitors, bafilomycin and N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, have no influence on the ATP effect. None of the proton pump inhibitors but vanadate has a direct effect on pHi. Vanadate produces a transient pHi increase upon application to the bathing medium, possibly as a result of its known effect of stimulating the Na+/H+ exchanger. Inhibition of Cl-/HCO3- exchange by decreasing extracellular Cl- gives a pronounced long-term pHi increase, supporting the hypothesis that this exchange has an important role in osteoclast pHi homeostasis. In Cl(-)-free extracellular medium, there is a greatly reduced effect of extracellular ATP on pHi.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The effects on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR), at rest and during bicycle exercise, of the vascular selective calcium antagonist felodipine, the cardio-selective beta-blocker metoprolol, and of the two drugs in combination, were assessed in a double-blind, three-way cross-over study comprising 23 patients with essential, mild to moderate hypertension. All three treatment regimens were given to each patient in randomised order for 4 weeks after a 4 week placebo run-in period. Felodipine 10-20 mg daily, metoprolol 100-200 mg daily and the combination of felodipine 10-20 mg plus metoprolol 100 mg daily were all effective antihypertensive treatments both at rest and during exercise. The two drugs seemed to have additive effects and the effect on BP of the combination was greater than that of either drug given as monotherapy. The mean sitting BP was 148/103 mmHg at randomisation, after 4 weeks of placebo treatment, and 134/88, 134/94 and 121/84 mmHg, respectively, after 4 weeks' treatment with felodipine, metoprolol and the combination. Maximal exercise capacity was similar irrespective of treatment regimen, and the normal response to exercise BP and HR was maintained during all active treatments. Changes observed in volume regulatory hormones (PRA, aldosterone and ANP) were consistent with a direct tubular natriuretic-diuretic effect of felodipine and of beta-blocker attenuated release of renin. All treatment regimens were well tolerated and adverse events reported were usually mild and transient.", 
    "70": "The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists pindolol and cyanopindolol, which bind to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1A receptors showed an anticonflict effect by increasing the number of punished licks in the Vogel conflict test in rats, when administered directly into the CA, region of the dorsal hippocampus (i.hp.). The maximum effect was observed after intrusion of 1 microgram of pindolol and 3 microgram of cyanopindolol. However, the selective beta 1-and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI 118,551, respectively, which have a negligible affinity for 5-HT receptors, did not affect the punished responding, when administered i.hp. in doses up to 10 micrograms. The anticonflict effect of pindolol (1 microgram) was significantly reduced by (S)-WAY 100135, a selective 5-HT1A-receptor antagonist, administered i.hp (0.1 microgram) or s.c. (10 mg/kg). Furthermore, (S)-WAY 100135 injected i.hp (0.3 micrograms) significantly antagonized the anticonflict effect of pindolol injected i.p. (8 mg/kg). (S)-WAY 100135 given alone i.hp. (0.03-3 micrograms) or s.c. (5-10 mg/kg) did not affect the punished responding in rats. These results indicate that the anticonflict effect of the beta-blockers which were tested, or at least pindolol, depends on their agonist action on postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors located in the hippocampus.", 
    "71": "Arachidonylethanolamide (AEA) was the first anandamide to be identified as an endogenous ligand for the cannabinoid receptor of porcine brain. Since cannabinoids have shown some value in the reduction of ocular hypertension, the title compound was evaluated in normotensive rabbits as a possible topically applied agent for reducing intraocular pressure. AEA was dissolved in an aqueous solution of 2-hydroxy-propyl-beta-cyclodextrin. Single eyedrops (25 microliters) containing 3.13, 6.25, 31.25, 62.5 or 125.0 micrograms of AEA were instilled unilaterally into eyes of normotensive albino and pigmented rabbits. The intraocular pressures (IOPs) of these rabbits were then measured at fixed time intervals. The effect of AEA on IOP in treated and untreated (contralateral) eyes was similar in both types of rabbits. Administration of 31.25 micrograms of AEA caused an immediate IOP reduction in the treated eyes. AEA doses of 62.5 micrograms caused an initial increase and subsequent decrease of IOP in the treated eyes. In the untreated eyes, a marginal ocular hypotensive response of limited duration occurred immediately after administration of AEA at doses 31.25 or 62.5 micrograms. A significant increase (without subsequent decrease below baseline) in IOP occurred in treated eyes after a dose of 125.0 micrograms. The lowest dose (3.13 micrograms) did not have an effect on IOP. This study constitutes the first published demonstration that topical, unilateral administration of AEA significantly decreases IOP in normotensive albino and pigmented rabbits. Although the mechanism of action by which this compound produces its hypotensive effect in the eye is not known, the results suggest that AEA may prove useful in the investigation of glaucoma therapy.",

The alteplase concentration and percentage of the single-chain molecule in each mixture were analyzed by using size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Alteplase bioactivity was determined by a clot-lysis assay. Drug concentrations were assayed by HPLC, pH values of the mixtures were determined, and the mixtures were visually inspected. Instability was defined as a > 10% decrease in concentration; inactivity was defined as a > 10% decrease in activity; incompatibility was defined as detection of a precipitate, opalescence, or color change. Alteplase was not stable in the presence of heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, or dobutamine and was not active in the presence of dopamine hydrochloride.

We used electrophysiological and binding techniques to assess the presence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors (beta 1AR and beta 2AR) in rat cardiac myocytes and to determine their ratio during aging. Experiments were performed in left ventricular myocytes enzymatically dissociated from the heart of 3-(young) or 22-month-old (old) Wistar Kyoto rats. 2. In patch-clamp experiments, myocytes from old rats showed a prolonged action potential duration (at -20 mV: 41.7 +/- 3.6 vs 26.2 +/- 3.1 ms; at -60 mV: 154.4 +/- 17.7 vs 87.1 +/- 6.9 ms, P < 0.05) and an augmented membrane capacitance (an index of cell size) (271.7 +/- 20.2 vs 164.3 +/- 14.6 pF, P < 0.05) compared to young rats. beta 2AR stimulation, achieved by superfusing myocytes with the selective beta 2AR agonist, zinterol (10 microM) or with (-)-isoprenaline (1 microM) in the presence of the selective beta 1AR antagonist, CGP 20712A (0.1 microM), significantly increased L-type calcium current (ICa,L) in rat ventricular myocytes. The percentage increase was similar in both young and old rats, either with zinterol (26.9 +/- 3.6% and 24.2 +/- 2.8%, respectively) or isoprenaline plus CGP 20712A (30.4 +/- 3.7% and 22.4 +/- 4.1%, respectively). Isoprenaline alone (beta 1AR and beta 2AR stimulation) caused a much smaller increase in ICa,L in old rats (58.4 +/- 12.1%) than in younger ones (95.3 +/- 8.1%) (P = 0.067). 3 The number of ,BAR mg-' protein, measured with saturation binding assays of the non selective ,betaAR antagonist [3H]-CGP 12177 was 1989.4+/-189.5 for 3- and of 1580.7 +/-161.5 for 22-month-old rats.Competition for [3H]-CGP 12177 binding by CGP 20712A gave biphasic curves which demonstrated two classes of binding sites. Densities (as percentages of total PAR density), and affinities for the two binding sites were: 80.4 +/- 2.2% (Ki = 6.6 +/- 1.3 nM) betaAR and 19.6 +/- 2.2% (Ki = 6.9 +/- 2.2 microM) beta2AR in young rats and 66.1 +/- 1.2% (Ki=8.3+/- 1.1 nM) beta1 AR and 33.9+/- 1.2% (Ki=5.2+/-0.6 PM) P2AR in old rats. Thebeta1AR/beta2AR ratio was significantly (P<0.01) reduced in old rats with respect to the younger ones.4 By combining electrophysiological and binding measurements, we calculated beta1AR and beta2ARdensities as number of receptors per microM2 of cell surface. In old rats, beta1 density was significantly decreased compared to young rats (8.4+/-2.0 vs 15.4+/-3.7 receptors microM-2, P<0.05), while beta2AR density remained unchanged at both 3 and 22 months (3.8 +/- 0.7 and 4.2+/-1.1 receptors microM-2, respectively).5 Our results demonstrate that both beta1AR and beta2AR are functionally present in rat ventricular myocytes of young and old rats. The decreased responsiveness to betaAR stimulation during aging appears to be associated with a selective reduction in the density of beta1AR.",

Each patient was prescribed an average of 3.9 drugs.

These results, though an improvement compared with those of an enquiry carried out 3 years ago, suggest that much prescription in the post-infarction period is not consistent with our present knowledge.",

Benzodiazepines, including the long-acting chlordiazepoxide (33%) and diazepam (16%), and less frequently the short-acting oxazepam (7%) and lorazepam (4%), were the most commonly used agents. Barbiturates (11%), phenytoin (10%), clonidine (7%), beta-blockers (3%), carbamazepine (1%), and antipsychotics (1%) were less frequently given.

    "81": "Fixed dose antihypertensive combinations are being used increasingly in the management of hypertension. There are advantages and disadvantages of this form of therapy. The key aims are to: (i) achieve increased efficacy by using drugs that complement each other's actions; (ii) use low doses to minimise adverse effects; and (iii) provide a simple once daily regimen. Fixed dose combinations containing metoprolol have the advantage that beta-blockers are drugs for which there is most evidence that they are cardioprotective; metoprolol is the best documented beta-blocker in this context. The early combination of conventional release metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide was inadequately investigated by modern standards, but proved well tolerated and effective in clinical practice. The introduction of the long acting metoprolol CR/ZOK (controlled release/zero order kinetics) produced a very satisfactory once daily preparation with no major pharmacokinetic interactions. The fixed dose combination of felodipine and metoprolol CR/ZOK has been well investigated. The two agents complement each other's actions and together provide very effective blood pressure control, cardioprotection and very good tolerability. A case can be made that this preparation more closely meets the requirements of an ideal antihypertensive than a single agent given alone.", 
    "82": "The existence and relative importance of beta 3-adrenoceptors in man is still controversial. The aim of the present study was 1) to find further evidence for the existence of functional beta 3-adrenoceptors in human fat, and 2) to investigate factors that may influence this beta 3-adrenoceptor function. Fifty individuals were examined. Lipolysis mediated by the selective beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist CGP 12177 in omental fat cells correlated with the response in subcutaneous fat cells. However, lipolysis was more pronounced in omental as compared to subcutaneous adipocytes, the intrinsic activity for CGP 12177 was 41% and 33%, respectively, while dobutamine, terbutaline and norepinephrine were full agonists. Both the lipolytic response and the sensitivity to CGP 12177 correlated with the effects of norepinephrine in the omental fat cells (r2 = 0.68 and 0.50, respectively, p = 0.0001). The beta 3-adrenoceptor mediated lipolytic response did also correlate with the responses induced by beta 1- and beta 2-agonists and by postreceptor acting agents. The antagonistic properties (pA2) of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were also investigated. The pA2 for the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists versus CGP 12177-induced lipolysis were 2 to 3 log units lower than those for the beta 1-antagonist versus dobutamine or for the beta 2-antagonist versus terbutaline. Furthermore, bupranolol had a significantly better antagonistic effect (pA2 7.17, p < 0.001) on the CGP 12177-induced lipolysis than had the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists (pA2 6.26 and 6.05, respectively). These data clearly support the existence of a third human beta-adrenoceptor. Several factors may contribute to the contradictory beta 3-adrenoceptor results in man. The sensitivity of the different lipolytic systems vary considerably. Omental fat cells are preferable to subcutaneous cells for beta 3-adrenoceptor studies in man. The beta 3-responses are more attenuated in isolated fat cell preparations than in tissue fragments. Furthermore, as the beta 3-adrenoceptor activity correlates to the norepinephrine activity, more pronounced effects will be expected in catecholamine sensitive subjects. At present, the number of tools available for beta 3-adrenoceptor studies are limited, and the receptor is hard to study, why it is essential to perform beta 3-adrenoceptor studies under optimal conditions in order to obtain conclusive effects.", 
    "83": "Recent work has demonstrated that stimulation of cAMP production via A2-adenosine receptors is reduced in cultured retinal pigment epithelial cells from the RCS rat. Cultured rat RPE cells are also shown to possess beta 2-adrenergic receptors positively coupled to cAMP production. Isoproterenol and salbutamol both stimulate cAMP levels with half maximal (EC50) values of 0.5 and 0.2 microM, respectively. Isoproterenol action is attenuated most effectively by the beta 2-antagonist, ICI 118551, while the beta 1-antagonist, CGP 20712A, is only partially effective. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production is markedly reduced in the RCS rat RPE when compared to control cultures. In passaged RCS rat RPE cells cAMP stimulation by 10 microM isoproterenol was 6.4% of that by control cultures and in primary cultures it was around 75% of controls. The observed EC50 values were 0.4 and 1.3 microM for passaged control and RCS rat RPE cells, respectively. Melatonin negatively influences cAMP production in the RPE via Gi-proteins. Melatonin attenuated the action of forskolin by 51.1% in control rat RPE but only by 18.6% in the RCS rat RPE. The dose-response curve for melatonin shows an approximate 1000-fold shift in potency in the RCS rat. bFGF also has an inhibitory effect on rat RPE cells. bFGF (50ng/ml) attenuated forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels by 61.9% in control rat RPE but had not effect on the action of forskolin in RCS rat RPE. Serotonin (100 microM) potentiates the forskolin-induced stimulation of cAMP by 140.1%. However, unlike isoproterenol, melatonin and bFGF, the action of serotonin on adenylate cyclase appears normal in the RCS rat RPE. We conclude that the defect in the RCS rat RPE is likely to be due to impaired coupling of the components of the adenylate cyclase system and that this is most probably an abnormal interaction of adenylate cyclase with G-protein alpha-subunits.", 
    "84": "CAD continues to be the principal cause of mortality in the United States, and the largest group of patients with CAD are those with stable angina. Among this group of patients, the most common manifestation of CAD is presence of transient episodes of myocardial ischemia. The presence of transient ischemia and not the severity of angina has been found to be associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with stable CAD. As part of a global treatment strategy for patients with stable CAD, changes in lifestyle and modification of coronary risk factors should be emphasized as an integral part of treatment. Conventional antianginal therapy is quite effective in controlling anginal attacks. Currently, several drugs and therapeutic strategies are available for the treatment of patients with angina (see Table 5). Nitrates are highly effective antianginal drugs with complex beneficial actions in patients with CAD, but their usefulness is limited by development of tolerance during long-term use. When clinically indicated, the use of nitrates should be supplemented with another longer-acting antianginal drug, such as a beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker. Based on the available data, beta-blockers, when tolerated, seem to be the most effective antianginal drugs for most patients with stable CAD. Beta-blockers are also the most effective anti-ischemic drugs that reduce the magnitude of myocardial ischemia detected during routine daily activities. Calcium channel blockers are also effective vasodilators and good antianginal drugs. The clinician should become familiar with the different actions that this heterogeneous group of drugs has on the heart and vessels. This knowledge allows the clinician to choose the appropriate combination of different antianginal drugs for patients on an individualized basis. It is also critical to develop the treatment strategy by carefully taking into account other associated medical conditions that are frequently encountered in patients with CAD.",

No significant variation in s-urea or s-creatinine was observed in either group, Three patients in the nadolol group and two in the NAD plus I5M developed ascites at 6 months (P = .70), and a need to increase diuretic regimen was observed in four and three patients, respectively (P = .76). Decrease in heart rate and in mean arterial pressure was similar in the two groups. There was a significant correlation between increases in s-creatinine and decrease in mean arterial pressure in the whole series (P = .015). Only in patients treated with the association was there a significant larger proportion of patients ascitic who became anascitic, than of patients anascitic who became ascitic (P = .03). In patients treated with the association, there was a significantly larger decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient (P = .05).

    "94": "Previous studies on beta-adrenergic agonist regulation of ion transport in distal airways yielded discordant results. The present study was performed to further investigate this process in isolated bronchiolar epithelial cells and resolve the discrepancies. Epithelial enriched in rabbit nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells responded to isoproterenol with a biphasic increase in transepithelial short circuit current (Isc) and decrease in transepithelial resistance (Rt). The first phase of the Isc response consisted of a transient, 11 microA/cm2 increase in current that was inhibited by HCO3(-)-free bathing solutions, but was not inhibited by amiloride, bumetanide, or Cl(-)-free bathing solutions. The ED50 for isoproterenol stimulation of the initial peak was 81 pM. The second phase was a prolonged, 27 microA/cm2 elevation in Isc. Amiloride in the apical bath inhibited basal Isc and the prolonged change in Isc induced by isoproterenol. Bumetanide in the basolateral bath and bilateral Cl(-)-free bathing solutions likewise inhibited the plateau phase of the isoproterenol response, and the inhibition was accentuated in the presence of amiloride. HCO3(-)-free bathing solutions did not inhibit the plateau phase. The ED50 for isoproterenol stimulation of the plateau phase was 6.3 nM. The bioelectric response to isoproterenol was mimicked by isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and, to a lesser degree, by dibutyryl-cAMP. Culturing the cells in medium containing cholera toxin completely inhibited the bioelectric response, yet the preparations continued to respond to isoproterenol with an increase in cAMP production.

    "96": "Neuropeptide Y has been shown to inhibit contractility in the rat heart. Although the reasons for this effect are not known, it is possible that postsynaptic adrenergic mechanisms involving neuropeptide Y may be responsible. To ascertain whether this neuromodulatory effect is possible for decreasing contractility, we investigated the effect of neuropeptide Y on agonist-stimulated contractility of the isolated rat myocardium. Receptor binding studies of purified cardiac membranes showed that incubating membrane in the presence of neuropeptide Y (10(-7) mol/L) decreased the number of alpha-/beta-adrenoceptor binding sites without affecting the affinity of these receptors. Isolated hearts perfused with phenylephrine (10(-5) to 10(-10) mol/L) or isoproterenol (10(-5) to 10(-10) mol/L) in a nonrecirculating Langendorff setup demonstrated a significant increase in contractility over control values, whereas no change in contractility was observed when the hearts were perfused with neuropeptide Y (10(-7) mol/L). However, in the presence of both agonist and neuropeptide Y the increase in contractility previously seen with agonist alone was not evident. Comparisons made with hearts taken from aortic banded rats yielded similar results. Although neuropeptide Y itself was ineffective in decreasing contractility, it prevented the agonists from stimulating contractility when perfused together. We conclude that neuropeptide Y does not directly decrease contractility but prevents agonist-stimulated increases in contractility through alpha-/beta-adrenoceptor pathways. This neuromodulatory effect of neuropeptide Y is unchanged in situations of increased sympathetic activity, such as hypertension.",

However, there is evidence that the benefits associated with a patent IRA are out of proportion to the observed improvement in ventricular function and may result not only from salvage of ischemic myocardium but also from the opening of the IRA beyond a narrow postinfarct time window. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the effect of IRA patency on outcome of patients after acute MI with left ventricular dysfunction while controlling for differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and the extent of coronary disease and (2) to determine the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy on patients with patent as well as occluded infarct arteries.",

While adrenalectomy did not prevent the effect of CH-38083, the block of the sympathetic transmission by chlorisondamine fully abolished the inhibitory effect of CH-38083 on LPS-induced TNF-alpha production, suggesting that the effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking agent is corticosteroid-independent, but it requires intact sympathetic activity. Since the selective block of alpha 2-adrenoceptors results in an increased sympathetic activity and an increase of the release of noradrenaline (NA) in both the central and the peripheral nervous systems, and in our experiments propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and atenolol, a selective antagonist of beta 1-adrenoceptors, prevented the effect of alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade by CH-38083 of the TNF-alpha response induced by LPS, it seems likely that the excessive stimulation by NA of beta 1-adrenoceptors is responsible for this action. The role of beta-adrenoceptors and endogenous catecholamines is further substantiated by the finding that pretreatment of animals with propranolol alone resulted in a dose-dependent increase of the TNF-alpha response induced by LPS, and that isoproterenol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, decreased it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "118": "Effective migraine treatment is clearly the most cost-effective in terms of both direct and indirect costs. Patient education, behavior changes, and prudent medication selection can minimize costs. Low-dose aspirin may reduce headache frequency. Among the antidepressant medications used, amitriptyine 25 mg, 3 qhs ($4.16/month) and doxepin 25 mg, 3 qhs ($10.50/month) remain the standard. Imipramine (25 mg, 3 qhs ($3.75/month) is very inexpensive and should replace nortriptyline 25 mg, 3 qhs ($64.29/month) as a second-line agent. The specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors are expensive and have no proven effect for migraine prevention. Propranolol 80 mg bid ($7.80/month) is inexpensive and frequently a good choice among beta-blockers. Atenolol 100 mg qd ($27.50/month) is less expensive than long-acting propranolol 160 mg ($35.56/month) and nadolol 120 mg qd ($43.68/month) with equivalent effectiveness. It is thus recommended as the long-acting beta-blocker of choice. Sustained-release preparations of verapamil 240 mg qd ($31.98/month) are twice the cost and less well-absorbed than the standard preparation of 120 mg bid ($17.62/month). Better information is needed concerning effectiveness and optimal dosing of some older low-cost medications in the preventive treatment of migraine.", 
    "119": "Little is known about the pathophysiological factors that determine the clinical severity of acute pancreatitis. Because impairment of pancreatic circulation and oxygenation is associated with greater disease severity and morphological damage in experimental pancreatitis it has been suggested that various vasoactive mediators might participate in the progression from the oedematous to the necrotising variety of the disease. This study used an animal model of acute pancreatitis induced by intravenous caeruleint (10 micrograms/kg/h for up to six hours), which does not entail either haemorrhage or significant necrosis of the pancreas. This study considered whether the administration or the inhibition of either nitric oxide, bradykinin, or adrenergic mediators can convert this mild variety into haemorrhagic and necrotising pancreatitis. Neither nitric oxide nor catecholamines were involved in the progression from oedematous to haemorrhagic pancreatitis. Their substitution, activation, and inhibition all failed to change the severity of the disease process. Bradykinin alone seemed to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic haemorrhage and necrosis. However, the inhibition of bradykinin and not its activation or substitution increased the severity of the disease.", 
    "120": "The physiatrist can now be instrumental in prolonging the survival of individuals with neuromuscular disease by using respiratory muscle aids. As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to increase for patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 yr (range, 5-41) satisfied criteria for having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEFs < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 yr. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "121": "Cardiac output (CO), dorsal aortic blood flow (BFDA) and blood pressure (PDA), and heart rate (HR) were recorded simultaneously in conscious freshwater eels. Physiological doses of [Asn1,Val5]angiotensin II (ANG II; 25-150 ng/kg iv) were used to investigate its effects on the blood flow [CO, BFDA, and estimated branchial shunting (BS)] and systemic vascular resistance (RSys) components of the pressor response and possible mechanism(s) of action. CO was increased mainly by an elevated stroke volume (SV) due to positive inotropy and/or Frank-Starling principle in a dose-related manner. An intact baroreceptor reflex attenuated the blood flow increase by 25% via the inhibitory cardiac vagal innervation. The elevation in estimated BS was a passive response to the increased CO, since the proportion of CO perfusing the pathway remained constant. PDA showed a similar dose-dependent increase in response to ANG II but the peak PDA preceded the peak CO responses at all doses; RSys was only transiently elevated at peak PDA. The increase in blood flow was an important contributor to the vasopressor responses. Alpha-Adrenergic blockade partially inhibited the pressor effect of ANG II (100 ng/kg) primarily by attenuating the increase in blood flow (50-70%). The data provide evidence for an ANG II-mediated cardiovascular control in teleosts directly and indirectly via catecholamine release.", 
    "122": "After cardiac denervation, a small-amplitude respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) has been described in animals and humans. Its mechanical and chemical determinants were investigated in 19 urethan-anesthetized, vagotomized, and mechanically ventilated rabbits. We measured the influence on RSA of arterial blood gases, beta-adrenergic blockade, and phasic and steady changes in right atrial pressure (RAP) induced by changes in tidal volume (VT, 20, 40, 60 ml), respiratory frequency (RF, 10, 20, 30 cycles/min), and dextran-induced RAP increases. Phasic changes in RAP during each recording were quantified as standard deviation of the first derivative of the RAP signal (dRAP) as a measure of magnitude of variations of the rate of change due to respiration. RSA was assessed by combined autoregressive power spectral analysis of R-R interval and respiration on sequences of 256 heart-beats. Despite vagotomy, RSA was present in all recordings in all animals. During room air breathing, RSA changes were dependent on RF and VT (P < 0.025 and P < 0.001, respectively) and correlated with dRAP (P < 0.001) and arterial PO2 (P < 0.001). beta-Adrenergic blockade did not change the amplitude of this residual RSA or its dependence on ventilatory mechanics. Dextran-induced increase in mean RAP from 2.9 to 11.9 mmHg did not modify RSA or dRAP. During 100% O2 inhalation, RSA changes were no longer significantly linked to RF and VT, and also the correlation of RSA with dRAP was reduced (P < 0.05). Changing the arterial PCO2 from 28 to 79 mmHg (induced by increasing dead space at fixed ventilation) did not modify RSA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "123": "The role of glucagon in the regulation of blood glucose in fed and fasted anesthetized rats was studied by injecting intravenously 4 ml/kg of a high-capacity (40 nmol/ml) high-affinity (0.6 x 10(11) mol/l) monoclonal glucagon antibody. Blood glucose was lowered by the antibody by 2 mmol/l in fed rats but remained unchanged in 10- and 48-h-fasted rats. Antibody injection significantly reduced plasma insulin in both fed and 10-h-fasted rats. In 10-h-fasted rats, propranolol injection decreased blood glucose by 0.6 mmol/l, and combined with antibody administration, a decrease by 1.1 mmol/l was observed. Blood glucose was never < 3.3 mmol/l. Thus glucagon is partly responsible for maintenance of euglycemia in fed rats, whereas during fasting it plays a limited role. However, immunoneutralization of glucagon reduces insulin secretion irrespective of blood glucose. Additional mechanisms seem to be responsible for the maintenance of blood glucose in the fasting state when glucagon and the sympathoadrenergic system are blocked.",

    "128": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) induce the proliferation of glioma cells in vitro. Trapidil and suramin inhibit this growth factor-stimulated glioma cell growth, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. The effects of trapidil and suramin on PDGF- and EGF-induced early biochemical events in T98G cells were studied. PDGF induced a rapid increase of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in fura-2/acetoxymethyl ester-loaded single glioma (T98G) cells. This increase was completely inhibited by removal of extracellular Ca2+ with ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid but not by an L-type calcium channel blocker (nicardipine), suggesting that PDGF may cause calcium influx through voltage-independent calcium channels in T98G cells. Trapidil and suramin blocked the PDGF-induced calcium response and inhibited the PDGF-initiated tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor as detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific for phosphotyrosine. Trapidil and suramin also inhibited EGF-initiated calcium response in T98G cells, but only partially inhibited EGF-initiated tyrosine phosphorylation at the same concentrations. Our results suggest that trapidil and suramin inhibit PDGF- and EGF-initiated early biochemical events, and thus suppress growth factor-induced cell proliferation.",

    "130": "The beta 3-adrenergic receptor (beta 3AR) is a member of the super-family of G protein-coupled receptors that are characterized by seven putative transmembrane helices connected by hydrophilic loops. The mechanism by which the activated beta ARs transmit the signals across the plasma membrane involves the stimulation of Gs, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase, yielding the second messenger cAMP. In the present study, we created a series of mutant beta 3ARs to explore the structural basis for the subtype-specific binding of BRL 37344, a beta 3-selective agonist, and for the coupling of the receptor to Gs. To study the mechanism of subtype-specific binding of BRL 37344, chimeric beta 2/beta 3ARs were constructed and expressed in Raji cells. Binding studies suggest that the transmembrane segment 5 region of the beta 3AR contains critical determinants for observed high affinity for BRL 37344. Previous studies of beta 2ARs have demonstrated a role for the third intracellular loop in activating Gs. To investigate the role of this region in the beta 3AR, we constructed mutant beta 3ARs lacking a small segment of the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domain of the third intracellular loop. Expression of these mutant receptors in mouse L cells and Raji cells reveals that although both mutants are capable of binding the antagonist [125l]iodocyanopindolol, the agonist-stimulated cAMP production mediated by these mutant receptors is markedly attenuated or abolished. In addition, both mutant beta 3ARs exhibit an approximately 10-fold increase in affinity for agonist binding, whereas the affinity for antagonists is not affected. This increased agonist affinity is not altered by treatment with 100 microM 5' quanylyl-imidodiphosphate, suggesting that these mutant receptors are uncoupled from G proteins. The results of the present study demonstrate that these regions of the third intracellular loop of beta 3AR are critical for coupling to G proteins and suggest a role for these regions in maintaining the resting state of the unliganded receptor.", 
    "131": "Nebivolol, a beta 1 selective adrenergic receptor antagonist with additional properties, is a racemic mixture of (S,R,R,R)- and (R,S,S,S)-enantiomers. We investigated its effects on human forearm vasculature. Blood flow was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography during brachial artery infusion of drugs. Interaction between nebivolol and the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway was investigated via comparison with carbachol (an endothelium-dependent agonist) and nitroprusside, and by coinfusion of a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, NG-monomethyl L-arginine (LNMMA) +/- L-arginine. Nebivolol (354 micrograms/min) increased blood flow by 91 +/- 18% (mean +/- SEM, n = 8, P < .01) whereas an equimolar dose of atenolol had no significant effect. L-NMMA (1 mg/min) inhibited vasodilation to nebivolol (by 65 +/- 10%) and carbachol (by 49 +/- 8%) to a significantly greater extent than it reduced responses to nitroprusside. Inhibition of nebivolol response by L-NMMA was abolished by L-arginine (62 +/- 11% inhibition by L-NMMA, 15 +/- 17% inhibition by L-NMMA with L-arginine, 10 mg/min, n = 8). Vasodilation caused by the (S,R,R,R)- and (R,S,S,S)-enantiomers was similar. We conclude that nebivolol vasodilates human forearm vasculature via the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway.",

It is difficult to objectively demonstrate ischaemia in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The first line treatment for chest pain considered to be ischaemic in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the use of either a beta blocker or calcium blocker. Septal myectomy can be effective in patients with symptoms refractory to conventional treatment but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Recently dual chamber pacing has been advocated in such patients. In some cases dual chamber pacing alleviates chest pain in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by an anti-ischaemic action, presumably by reducing the left ventricular outflow tract gradient and perhaps by causing an associated decrease in left ventricular outflow tract gradient and perhaps by causing an associated decrease in left ventricular end diastolic pressure.",

Pretreatment with HOE 140 or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester abolished the cardioprotective effect of ramiprilat. Neither stimulation nor antagonism of angiotensin II receptors altered infarct size from the saline control level. Also, when isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation, ramiprilat (100 mumol/L) and bradykinin (10 nmol/L) improved cell viability (approximately 60%), and the protective effect of both agents was reversed by administration of HOE 140 (10 mumol/L).",

Function of rings denuded of ECs was assessed by observing S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP)-induced vasorelaxation following submaximal contraction by U-46619. Carvedilol exerted a significant protective effect against pyrogallol-induced vasoconstriction (17.1 +/- 4.8 vs. 31.9 +/- 5.4% for vehicle, p < 0.05).

    "144": "1. Dopaminergic transmission was investigated in the central nervous system (CNS) of the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. 2. The giant pedal neuron, designated as right pedal dorsal one (RPeD1), makes chemical, monosynaptic connections with a number of identified follower cells in the CNS. Previous work has shown that RPeD1 is an interneuron and a important component of the Lymnaea respiratory central pattern generator. In this study, the hypothesis that RPeD1 uses dopamine as its neurotransmitter was tested by chromatographic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological methods. Characterization of RPeD1's transmitter pharmacology is essential to clearly understand its role in Lymnaea. 3. Earlier studies demonstrated that the soma of RPeD1 contains dopamine. This was quantitated in the present study by high-performance liquid chromatography (with electrochemical detection) of isolated RPeD1 somata and growth cones, which yielded 0.8 +/- 0.3 and 0.10 +/- 0.08 pmol of dopamine per soma and growth cone, respectively. 4. Bath or pressure application of dopamine to follower cells of RPeD1, in situ, mimicked the effects of RPeD1 stimulation. Dose-response curves were constructed for the excitatory effect of dopamine on follower cells, visceral dorsal two and three (VD2/3) (ED50 = 39 microM; Hill coefficient = 1.03), and the inhibitory effect of dopamine on follower cell, visceral dorsal four (ED50 = 33 microM; Hill coefficient = 0.92). 5. The following dopamine agonists (100 microM) were tested by bath application: 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (ADTN), apopmorphine, 2-bromo-alpha-ergocryptine, deoxyepinephrine (DE), mesulergine, (-) quinpirole, SKF 38393, and tyramine. Only the general dopamine agonists, ADTN and DE, mimicked RPeD1's effects on its follower cells. 6. When VD2/3 was isolated and plated in vitro, it maintained a depolarizing response to dopamine. This response was reduced by intracellular injection of the G-protein blocker, GDP-beta-S (2 mM in electrode). Similarly, incubation of VD2/3, in vitro for approximately 18 h, with pertussis toxin (PTX; 5 micrograms/ml), the G-protein inactivating exotoxin, also reduced the dopamine response. Injecting GDP or incubating in heat-inactivated PTX did not effect the response. 7. Several dopamine antagonists were used in an attempt to block RPeD1's synapses: chlorpromazine, ergonovine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, 6-hydroxydopamine, SCH 23390, (+/-) sulpiride, and tubocurarine. Only the D-2 dopamine receptor antagonist, (+/-) sulpiride, reversibly blocked synaptic transmission from RPeD1 to its follower cells. Both the (+) and the (-) enantiomer of sulpiride also antagonized synaptic transmission. A dose-inhibition curve for (+/-) sulpiride was constructed (IC50 = 47 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "145": "Estimates of variance in pharmacological assays are usually made by repeating the experiment with different tissues. Biological factors, such as the inability to wash a drug from tissue, may preclude the type of replication that is appropriate for the statistics of interest. For example, in Schild regressions, replication is usually done at each concentration of antagonist. In some test systems, replication of dose-response curves is not possible. For example, some persistent agonists cannot be removed from tissues after exposure, while in other systems, rapid desensitization severely alters tissue sensitivity to repeated challenge with agonist. In this paper, we demonstrate how a statistical resampling method, bootstrapping, can be used to derive estimates of the confidence intervals for pA2, pKB, and slope from Schild plots. This method utilizes the speed of the computer to estimate variance by repeatedly resampling the data. The advantage to this method is that it can be used for many different experimental designs. For a data set obtained from a Schild regression of atenolol antagonism of isoproterenol in the guinea pig left atrium, bootstrap estimates of confidence limits were calculated for cases where dose ratios were derived from the same tissue and randomly paired tissues. These estimates showed good agreement with estimates obtained using conventional analytical methods, thus suggesting that this method may be useful in practice.", 
    "146": "Previous reports based on studies with serotonin (5-HT) precursors or direct acting agonists have suggested that postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptors may stimulate cortisol and prolactin (PRL) secretion in man. To further clarify the role of these receptors in the regulation of cortisol and PRL secretion in man, the effects of 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl) pirazine (MK-212), a centrally acting direct 5-HT2A/5-HT2C agonist, on the above hormones were studied in 11 normal men with and without pretreatment with pindolol, a 5-HT1A partial agonist. MK-212 induced a significant increase in plasma concentrations of cortisol and PRL. The MK-212-induced response in plasma cortisol was not diminished by pindolol pretreatment, whereas the MK-212-induced PRL response was significantly inhibited by pindolol pretreatment. These data suggest that the MK-212-induced cortisol response may be mediated by 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptor activation, or both, despite 5-HT1A inhibition; however, PRL secretion by MK-212 requires 5-HT1A receptor availability as well as 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor activation, since blockade of the former appears to blunt the PRL responses to MK-212. These findings may be explained by postulating a cooperativity between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptors with regard to the 5-HT-dependent stimulation of PRL secretion.", 
    "147": "Hypertrophy of the overloaded heart, characterized by an increased number of sarcomeres, provides an adaptive, short-term response. However, when cardiac overload is long-standing, the hypertrophic response appears to cause shortened myocyte survival. The mechanisms responsible for the deleterious effects of chronic myocardial hypertrophy may include a maladaptive growth response of the mature heart. Because terminally differentiated adult cardiac myocytes have little or no capacity to divide, stimuli that promote growth in the overloaded adult heart cannot lead to normal cell division. Instead, overload initiates an unnatural growth response that appears to shorten cardiac myocyte survival, possibly because the same growth factors that mediate the hypertrophic response of the adult heart can also induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). The converting enzyme inhibitors and nitrates, which have growth-inhibitory as well as vasodilator effects, may improve prognosis in heart failure by inhibiting the production of transcription factors. These transcription factors stimulate both the unnatural growth response to overload and stimuli that lead to apoptosis. Since both beta-adrenergic agonists and cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, can stimulate production of similar transcription factors, evidence suggests that beta blockers and vesnarinone improve the prognosis in patients with heart failure possibly because of their ability to inhibit maladaptive growth.", 
    "148": "The end-stage heart failure phenotype is characterized by marked dyspnea on exertion, edema, and overwhelming fatigue, and by a high incidence of sudden death. Patients who display the end-stage phenotype have transitioned from a normal phenotype with myocardial damage at a cellular level. This transition appears to be mediated by events at both the cellular and molecular levels. Until recently, it was generally believed that this transition was irreversible. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the phenotype can be changed with pharmacologic agents. These agents have been demonstrated to improve exercise capability, increase ventricular function, and improve symptoms. Important recent studies have shown that pharmacologic agents can substantially alter the high mortality rates associated with the end-stage heart failure phenotype. As we learn more about the molecular and cellular events that initiate and support the transition from cardiac compensation to decompensation, we will be able to improve our pharmacologic targeting and, we hope, be able to delay the development of the end-stage heart failure phenotype to an even greater degree.",

    "150": "In 100 eyes, the intraocular pressure was measured before as well as 2-4, 5-7, and 22-24 hours after phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens implantation. Each of 25 patients received either 1% topical apraclonidine, 0.5% topical levobunolol, 500 mg oral acetazolamide, or placebo. Forty four eyes were operated with sclerocorneal sutureless tunnel and 56 eyes with corneoscleral incision and suture. Sixty three operations were performed by experienced surgeons (more than 300 intraocular operations) and 37 by inexperienced surgeons (less than 200 intraocular operations).", 
    "151": "The pressure increase from baseline to the maximum 5-7 hours after surgery did not differ significantly (p = 0.8499) for apraclonidine (9.5 mm Hg), levobunolol (7.2 mm Hg), acetazolamide (7.8 mm Hg), and placebo (8.6 mm Hg). The increase was significantly (p = 0.0095) lower in eyes with corneoscleral tunnel (5.5 mm Hg) than in eyes with corneoscleral suture (10.5 mm Hg) and significantly (p = 0.0156) lower for experienced (6.6 mm Hg) than for inexperienced surgeons (11.2 mm Hg).", 
    "152": "The intraocular pressure rise after phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens implantation depends strongly on the technique of wound closure and the surgeon's experience. Compared with these two factors, the effect of prophylactic medication can be neglected.", 
    "153": "A method is described for the analytical determination of the neuroleptics azaperone (plus its metabolite azaperol), acetylpromazine, propionylpromazine, chlorpromazine and the beta-blocking agent carazolol in pork kidneys. These compounds may be used illegally to calm pigs during their transport to the abattoir. The kidney samples (plus atosil as an internal standard) are incubated with NaOH (90 degrees C, 60 min); the rather fluid samples are extracted with diethylether. The separation of interfering compounds in the extracts is achieved on a silica gel column. The remaining interfering compounds are removed with ether after acidification of the eluted material. After alkalization of the aqueous solution, the drugs are extracted with either and applied to a Symmetry RP18 column (mobile phase: acetate buffer solution pH 4.5/acetonitrile/tetrahydrofurane, 65/30/10 by volume by HPLC. Recovery in spiked samples of pork kidneys (recovery of 50 micrograms/kg, carazolol 5 micrograms/kg) was between 71.5% (for propionylpromazine) and 88% (for azaperol). The method was verified on samples of treated pigs.", 
    "154": "All available beta-blockers are effective in the treatment of high blood pressure. Differences in the pharmacokinetics are important as they can have an impact on their clinical use. Betaxolol, a beta-1-selective blocker has a long biological half-life which can control the blood pressure and pulse rate for 24 hours. The authors investigated 20 patients with mild and medium severe hypertension by out-patient monitoring of the blood pressure. Treatment was focused on influencing the morning rise of blood pressure and pulse rate. The results confirm the effectiveness of betaxolol (Lokren) in the administered dose of 10-20 mg once per day. A favourable response was obtained in 75% when checked by a sphygmomanometer. The morning readings of blood pressure at 5, 6 and 7 o'clock following treatment did not exceed 90 mmHg diastolic pressure. It was also found that there is a statistically significant difference in the effect exerted on pressure and pulse rate in daytime, while the difference at nighttime is not significant. This mild reduction on blood pressure and pulse rate during the night is an advantage in particular in elderly patients. Lokren treatment did not have any serious side-effects it did not affect laboratory values or ECG with the exception of the pulse rate.", 
    "155": "Greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has led to more aggressive management and lower mortality, both in-hospital and long term. AMI results mainly from thrombotic occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery. The ensuing necrosis evolves over a 6-12 h period providing a time window for interventions designed to reduce eventual infarct size. The most appropriate interventions are those which restore coronary artery patency and hence myocardial blood flow as soon as possible. Occasionally, disruption of the occluding thrombus and compression of the underlying atheromatous lesion is best achieved by direct percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. For the vast majority however, revascularisation by drug therapy is more appropriate. As soon as possible, all patients without contraindications should be offered oral aspirin and intravenous thrombolysis, usually with streptokinase but occasionally with tissue plasminogen activator. Patients in whom these agents are contraindicated should be considered for intravenous beta-blockade using atenolol or metoprolol to reduce myocardial demand and hence infarct size. Patients with large infarcts, impaired ventricular function, left ventricular failure or hypertension should be considered for early angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Other agents may be valuable symptomatically, but have no proven role in reducing infarct size or mortality. After the first 24 h, the main aims of management are to assess the likelihood of later ischaemic events or death (risk stratification) and hence to choose appropriate long term secondary prophylaxis.", 
    "156": "Chronic beta-blocker therapy improves hemodynamics and cardiac function in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the change in myocardial uptake of I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) before and after treatment has not been determined. Myocardial imaging with 123I-MIBG was performed before and 2 or 3 months after beta-blocker (bisoprolol) therapy in 11 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The following parameters were compared before and after the treatment: 1) New York Heart Association functional class, 2) X-ray cardiothoracic ratio, 3) heart rate and blood pressure, 4) echocardiographic data (left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, and left ventricular ejection fraction), 5) plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine and human atrial natriuretic peptide (HANP), and 6) exercise tolerance time by treadmill. The heart-to-mediastinum ratio of 123I-MIBG activities obtained 3 hours after intravenous injection (late H/M) and washout rate improved significantly after beta-blocker therapy. Cardiothoracic ratio, heart rate, echocardiographic parameters, HANP and exercise tolerance also improved significantly. Late H/M had no significant relationship with any of the clinical parameters, but washout rate was significantly related to left ventricular ejection fraction. These findings suggest that washout rate may be useful to assess the effect of short-term beta-blocker therapy in dilated cardiomyopathy patients.", 
    "157": "To measure changes in haemodynamics and myocardial blood flow after acute intravenous (i.v.) and intracoronary (i.c.) injection of bisoprolol in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "158": "A prospective, randomized controlled study of 14 patients (12 men, 2 women; mean age 65 [50-73] years) with angio-graphically proven coronary artery stenosis (reduced in lumen of at least 70%) in one or more major vessels. Seven patients received, before balloon angioplasty, either 0.01 mg/kg body weight directly into the coronaries (group 1, infusion through the guiding catheter) or 2.5 mg (group 2, via the sheath). Heart rate and blood pressure were measured before and after bisoprolol injection. Coronary blood flow was measured by the thermodilution method via two indwelling catheters in the coronary sinus.", 
    "159": "After bisoprolol there was a reduction in heart rate (group 1: from 83/min to 75/min; group 2: from 77/min to 72/min) and blood pressure (group 1: from 137/80 mm Hg to 125/70 mm Hg; group 2: from 135/86 mm Hg to 126/80 mm Hg). Coronary blood flow was lower after i.c. bisoprolol injection than before (group 1: 383 ml/min vs 352 ml/min, but higher after i.v. injection (group 2: 353 ml/min vs 384 ml/min). These differences were statistically not significant.", 
    "160": "While after-load was clearly reduced and myocardial blood flow remained unchanged, bisoprolol improved myocardial oxygen balance. No different effects could be detected after intracoronary vs intravenous application of bisoprolol.", 
    "161": "Adrenoceptors mediating contraction in ring segments of human umbilical arteries from normal term pregnancies were investigated in vitro. Contraction was elicited by (order of potency indicated): noradrenaline = the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist oxymetazoline > the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin antagonized the contraction elicited by noradrenaline and phenylephrine. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine antagonized the contraction elicited by noradrenaline and oxymetazoline. Oxymetazoline had an efficacy 5 times higher than that of noradrenaline and the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist methysergide antagonized the contraction elicited by oxymetazoline. It is suggested that the contractile adrenoceptors in the human umbilical artery consist of both alpha 1 and alpha 2 subtypes. Furthermore, the contractile effect of oxymetazoline seems to be mediated via both alpha 2-adrenoceptors and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.", 
    "162": "The major objective of the Trimetazidine European Multicenter Study (TEMS) was to compare in a double-blind trial the anti-ischemic effects of trimetazidine (20 mg 3 times daily) with those of propranolol (40 mg 3 times daily). The inclusion criteria were based on an abnormal response to a multistage exercise test. After 3 months of treatment the improvements noted in all exercise testing data were similar in the trimetazidine and propranolol groups; similar data were obtained for the grades and severity of anginal attacks during daily life (from patient diaries). A 24-hour Holter monitoring was performed at entry and at the end of the study, but an abnormal Holter monitoring (1-mm ST-segment depression during at least 1 minute) was not an inclusion criterion. This explains why at entry only 50% of the patients in both groups had an abnormal Holter recording. After 3 months of treatment, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups, but we observed a trend toward a decrease in ambulatory ischemia in the trimetazidine group and a trend toward an increase in ambulatory ischemia in the propranolol group. These data in the propranolol group are in total disagreement with the available literature on beta blockers, which was due to a totally erratic behavior pattern in 2 patients in the propranolol group. When we excluded these 2 erratic cases from the propranolol group and extended our analysis to all available paired comparisons (day -14 to day 30 and day 0 to day 90), we were able to compare 44 and 60 observations, both off therapy and on either propranolol or trimetazidine, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "165": "Cases were hypertensive patients who sustained a first fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction from 1986 through 1993 among women and from 1989 through 1993 among men. Controls were a stratified random sample of hypertensive GHC enrollees, frequency matched to the cases on age, sex, and calendar year. All 623 cases and 2032 controls had pharmacologically treated hypertension. Data collection included a review of the ambulatory medical record a brief telephone interview of consenting survivors. Antihypertensive therapy was assessed using the GHC's computerized pharmacy database.", 
    "166": "The first analysis included only the 335 cases and 1395 controls initially free of cardiovascular disease. Compared with users of diuretics alone, the adjusted risk ratio of myocardial infarction was increased by about 60% among users of calcium channel blockers with or without diuretic (risk ratio = 1.62%; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.11 to 2.34; P = .01). The second analysis was restricted to 384 cases and 1108 controls who were taking either a calcium channel blocker or a beta-blocker. Among these subjects, the use of calcium channel blockers compared with beta-blockers was associated with about a 60% increase in the adjusted risk of myocardial infarction (risk ratio = 1.57; 95% Cl, 1.21 to 2.04; P < .001). While high doses of beta-blockers were associated with a decreased risk of myocardial infarction (trend P = .04), high doses of calcium channel blockers were associated with an increased risk (trend P < .01).", 
    "167": "In this study of hypertensive patients, the use of short-acting calcium channel blockers, especially in high doses, was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Ongoing large-scale clinical trials will assess the effect of various antihypertensive therapies, including calcium channel blockers, on several important cardiovascular end points. Until these results are available, the findings of this study support the current guidelines from the Joint National Committee on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure that recommend diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line agents unless contraindicated, unacceptable, or not tolerated.", 
    "168": "The solution structure of omega-conotoxin MVIIA (SNX-111), a peptide toxin from the fish hunting cone snail Conus magus and a high-affinity blocker of N-type calcium channels, was determined by 2D NMR spectroscopy. The backbones of the best 44 structures match with an average pairwise RMSD of 0.59 angstroms. The structures contain a short segment of triple-stranded beta-sheet involving residues 6-8, 20-21, and 24-25. The structure of this toxin is very similar to that of omega-conotoxin GVIA with which is has only 40% sequence homology, but very similar calcium channel binding affinity and selectivity.", 
    "169": "The three-dimensional solution structure of omega-conotoxin MVIIA, a 25-mer peptide antagonist of N-type calcium channels, was determined by two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy with simulated annealing calculations. A total of 13 converged structures of omega-conotoxin MVIIA were obtained on the basis of 273 experimental constraints, including 232 distance constraints obtained from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities, 22 torsion angle (phi, chi 1) constraints, and 19 constraints associated with hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds. The atomic root mean square difference about the averaged coordinate positions is 0.47 +/- 0.08 A for the backbone atoms (N, C alpha, C) and 1.27 +/- 0.14 A for all heavy atoms of the entire peptide. The molecular structure of omega-conotoxin MVIIA is composed of a short triple-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. The overall beta-sheet topology is +2x, -1, which is the same as that reported for omega-conotoxin GVIA, another N-type calcium channel blocker. The orientation of beta-stranded structure is similar to each other, suggesting that the conserved disulfide bond combination is essential for the molecular folding. We have recently determined by using alanine substitution analyses that Tyr 13 is essential for the activity of both toxins. On the basis of functional and structural analysis, it is shown that both omega-conotoxin MVIIA and GVIA retain a similar conformation to locate Tyr 13 in the appropriate position to allow binding to N-type calcium channels. These results provide a molecular basis for understanding the mechanism of calcium channel modulation through the toxin-channel interaction and insight into the discrimination of different subtypes of calcium channels.",

    "171": "Peripheral adenocarcinoma (PAC) of the lung has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and is today the leading histological type of lung cancer in smokers and nonsmokers in industrialized countries. There is no apparent explanation for the steep rise in the number of individuals developing this cancer type. Using assays for the assessment of cell proliferation, receptor binding, and production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), we have identified a beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated mitogenic pathway, which activates cAMP down-stream, in cell lines derived from human peripheral adenocarcinomas that express features of Clara cells. Agonists of beta-adrenergic receptors strongly stimulated cell proliferation, whereas antagonists of this receptor and its associated second messenger, cAMP, were potent inhibitors of this effect. Agonists of beta-adrenergic receptors are the active ingredients of many decongestants and bronchodilators, and such medications are, therefore, likely to stimulate this pathway in vivo. Patients suffering from chronic upper and lower respiratory tract diseases and treated with such medications over many years may, therefore, be at a higher risk than the average population to develop PAC, particularly when simultaneously exposed to carcinogenic environmental factors such as smoking. Because the incidence of chronic respiratory tract diseases has risen in industrialized countries during the same time frame as PAC, a potential etiological link between the therapy of such nonneoplastic diseases with beta-adrenergic agonists and the risk for PAC should be investigated."
