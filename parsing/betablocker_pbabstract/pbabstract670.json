    "0": "The effect on intraocular pressure (IOP) of topical timolol was studied in 30 patients with arterial hypertension treated with oral alprenolol, metoprolol or timolol. No patient had any known eye disorder. Topical administration of timolol induced a significant reduction of IOP regardless if the patients had systemic beta-blockade or not. Treatment with topical timolol alone was equally effective in reducing IOP as combined topical and oral therapy. Patient compliance was checked with plasma concentrations of the different beta-blockers.", 
    "1": "The hormonal and cardiovascular responses to intravenous (i.v.) insulin were studied in 16 insulin-dependent normotensive diabetic patients after acute injection of selective beta-1-adrenoceptor blocking agents. The lowest blood glucose levels were not affected by beta-1-adrenoceptor blockade while the time for reaching nadir was significantly reduced. Plasma adrenaline levels increased significantly during selective beta-1-adrenoceptor blockade. Plasma noradrenaline, glucagon and human growth hormone levels, however, remained unaffected. The insulin-induced tachycardia was not prevented by the beta-1-blockade, and the mean arterial blood pressure was unchanged. The ability to recognize the symptoms of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia persisted in all patients, although less pronounced in nine of them. We suggest that selective beta-1-adrenergic blocking agents may be employed without risk in the treatment of hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients.", 
    "2": "Dichloroisoproterenol (DCI) and propranolol were found to inhibit sickling in vivo when they were added to red-cell suspensions prior to deoxygenation. The effectiveness was maximal between PO2's of 30 and 40 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa). When cells were sickled at a low oxygen tension (PO2 = 32 mmHg), and then DCI was added later, the drug decreased the degree of sickling while the suspension was maintained at the same oxygen tension. The antisickling effect of these drugs was not antagonized by isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic stimulator, by the addition of cAMP or increase of the intracellular calcium concentration. Other beta-blockers, such as MJ1999 (sotalol) and timolol, did not show antisickling activity. It was also found that DCI, propranolol, and timolol had some effect on the delay time of gelation of sickle-cell hemoglobin (Hb S), as well as on the oxygen affinity of sickle cells.", 
    "3": "Binding of pindolol and 8 related compounds was studied in vitro by equilibrium dialysis. The overall binding in serum was compared with the binding to the main, isolated, serum proteins. Most substances show both saturable and non-saturable binding in serum. The saturable and main binding is to alpha 1-AGP, the low non-saturable binding corresponds to albumin and lipoprotein binding. The binding to alpha 1-AGP is characterized by approximately one binding site and association constants K ranging from 10(4) to 10(6) M-1. The binding of pindolol to alpha 1-AGP is strongly inhibited by propranolol, lidocaine, erythromycin, imipramine and TBEP. Significant correlations were found between log NK and log partition coefficient octanol-phosphate buffer suggesting that the protein binding of the 9 adrenergic beta-receptor antagonists to all serum proteins, including alpha 1-AGP, is predominantly hydrophobic in nature.", 
    "4": "The psychiatric side effects of the major antihypertensive drugs other than reserpine are reviewed, including centrally acting drugs such as methyldopa and clonidine, peripheral adrenergic drugs such as guanethidine, beta-adrenoceptor blockers such as propranolol, and diuretics. Problems with differential diagnosis and with the interpretation of case reports make assessment of psychiatric side effects difficult. Sedation and sleep disturbances are the most common side effects, occurring with methyldopa, clonidine, and propranolol. Only methyldopa is clearly associated with depression. Other reported effects are toxic confusional states and psychotic reactions. These are rare, however, and no clear patterns of development have been recognized.", 
    "5": "There is a discrepancy between the effect of beta-blockade on exercise heart rate and the effect on exercise capacity. Thus, it was of interest to study the dose-response relationship between an unselective (propranolol) and a beta 1-selective (atenolol) blocker and endurance exercise performance. Nine habitually active males ran their own jogging route 10 times and the distances of the routes ranged between 4000 and 10000 m. Placebo (twice), 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg of atenolol and 40, 80, 120, and 160 mg of propranolol were administered orally with a double-blind, crossover procedure. After each experiment, running time and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) were registered. Small drug doses markedly affected exercise heart rates yet such doses minimally affected running performance when on the beta 1 selective blocker. With 160 mg propranolol, a greater exercise impairment occurred than with 100 mg atenolol (P less than 0.05). RPE data suggested that drug treatment induced an increased subjective feeling of fatigue in addition to the impaired performance, and these changes were positively related (r = 0.66, P less than 0.05). Impairment of exercise performance during acute beta-blockade is evidently not related solely to the effect on heart rate. The nature of other drug effects is presently unclear although there is evidence that the metabolic profile of the muscle is implicated.", 
    "6": "In 18 patients with essential hypertension serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly (P less than 0.001) increased following short-term chlorthalidone therapy, but not during combination therapy with chlorthalidone and a betablocker. This tendency was similar in two subgroups which were studied with an inverse sequence of drug administration. In Group I (11 men), a 22% increase (P less than 0.01) in LDL-C during chlorthalidone monotherapy was restored to normal 6 weeks after addition to a betablocker to the diuretic; in Group II (5 men, 2 postmenopausal women) LDL-C levels were increased by 41% (P less than 0.05) 6 weeks after withdrawal of the betablocker from the combination therapy. No significant changes occurred during either the treatment phase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol or apoprotein B levels. It is concluded that combination therapy with a betablocker may prevent or reverse an increase in serum LDL-C associated with short-term chlorthalidone monotherapy.", 
    "7": "The cardiostimulatory effects of prenalterol, a beta-1-adrenoceptor partial agonist, were studied in vivo and in vitro and compared to those evoked by isoprenaline, a full agonist, and to those of other partial agonists. In the anaesthetized rat, prenalterol and terbutaline were found not to elevate the myocardial cyclic AMP content; this was in sharp contrast to isoprenaline. Both partial agonists did, however, produce significant effects on heart rate. In the anaesthetized cat, prenalterol exhibited chronotropic and inotropic intrinsic activities of 88 and 76% respectively in relation to isoprenaline. No statistically significant increase in myocardial cyclic AMP content could however be detected. Prenalterol did not stimulate adenylate cyclase significantly in the cat myocardial homogenate. This was also true of the beta-2-adrenoceptor selective partial agonist procaterol. In this preparation, isoprenaline, noradrenaline and adrenaline acted as full agonists. Furthermore, prenalterol produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of isoprenaline-activated adenylate cyclase. Our data indicate that maximal cardiac stimulation occurs at a low level of adenylate cyclase activation and low myocardial cyclic AMP concentration when provoked by a full beta-adrenoceptor agonist. The maximal physiological effects of a partial agonist such as prenalterol may consequently be achieved at a marginal activation of the adenylate cyclase. The present data may thus support the hypothesis of a large beta-adrenoceptor reserve for full agonists in the heart.", 
    "8": "The pharmacokinetics of a single dose (75 mg) of dl-moprolol and l-moprolol, a new beta -blocking agent, were appraised over 3 days in two groups of ten volunteers. The peak plasma level (GLC method) (598 +/- 99 ng/ml), the area under the curve (3.054 +/- 578 ng.ml/h), and 24-h urinary excretion (34.83 +/- 6.33 mg) after 1-moprolol intake were more elevated than after dl-moprolol intake. However, the plasma elimination half-life was not statistically different, 2.3 +/- 0.26 h after 1-moprolol versus 2.11 +/- 0.3 h after dl-moprolol. The double product (systolic blood pressure x heart rate) was significantly decreased only in volunteers after receiving 1-moprolol but not after dl-moprolol. The mean pharmacodynamic half-life estimated from exercise heart rate after dl-moprolol was 11.6 h.", 
    "9": "Propranolol and nadolol were used in two groups of patients having ventricular arrhythmias. The two groups were characterised by differences in sympathetic drive. The 10 non-adrenergic patients had idiopathic, monomorphic extrasystoles (isolated with fixed coupling or in pairs or salvoes) arising from the right ventricle or the septum. These extrasystoles were chronic and benign, with a slightly increased daytime frequency (day:night = 1.6). They disappeared on exercise. The nine adrenergic patients had less frequent but more complex polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles, and rapid and irregular tachycardias which were resistant. They occurred predominantly during the day and were associated particularly with stress and exercise. They were either idiopathic, or coexisted with mitral valve prolapse (three cases) or hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (one case) in young patients (mean age, 32 years) who did not have coronary heart disease. Nadolol was more effective than propranolol in controlling the arrhythmia, heart rate, and variations in sinus rhythm in the adrenergic group, while the arrhythmia was not controlled in the non-adrenergic group. Using clinical variables, comparison of the frequency of extrasystoles by day and night, and assessment of the antiarrhythmic effect of beta-blockers, the role of the sympathetic tone in non-ischaemic ventricular arrhythmias may be elucidated.", 
    "10": "The incidence and possible mechanism of early spontaneous termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was studied in 20 consecutive patients. Episodes of induced tachycardia that terminated spontaneously within the 1st minute after initiation were included. Tachycardias ending spontaneously were associated with a reproducible course of hypotension at the onset followed by blood pressure recovery above control levels and termination. Spontaneous termination of tachycardias occurred within the A-V node 18 to 45 seconds (mean +/- standard error of the mean 27.9 +/- 5.3) after their onset. In the supine position (0 degrees) 9 (45 percent) of 20 patients showed spontaneous termination in 36 (16 percent) of 219 episodes of tachycardia. In the head-dependent position (-20 degrees) only 1 (8 percent) of 13 patients manifested spontaneous termination in 2 (4 percent) of 54 episodes. In the head up position (+60 degrees) only 1 (6 percent) of 18 patients exhibited termination in 2 (2 percent) of 102 episodes. After partial cholinergic blockade with intravenous hyoscine butylbromide, 20 mg, or atropine, 0.6 mg, none of five patients showed spontaneous termination in 25 episodes. After beta adrenergic blockade with 10 mg of propranolol intravenously, none of 16 patients showed spontaneous termination in 87 episodes of tachycardia. We conclude that the initial hypotension during tachycardia evokes a sympathetic response that increases blood pressure and this increase in turn causes a rise in vagal tone that breaks the tachycardia.", 
    "11": "Medical management of pheochromocytoma involves the use of many therapeutic agents. Phenoxybenzamine HCl (Dibenzyline), an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, at 40 to 80 mg per day can control the disease in most patients. Use of this drug up to the time of operation is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol is indicated only after adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade in patients with tachycardia and catecholamine-induced arrhythmias. Alpha-methylparatyrosine (Metyrosine), which decreases catecholamine synthesis, is a new drug recently released for the treatment of pheochromocytoma when surgery is contraindicated or in cases of malignant pheochromocytoma. The use of a combination of anesthetic agents, such as nitrous oxide, thiopental, narcotics, and enflurane, ensures smooth induction of anesthesia in most cases. Careful and prompt control of hypertensive crises with sodium nitroprusside and of arrhythmias with propranolol and lidocaine are critical to the success of surgery.", 
    "12": "Renal (cortex and medulla) and splanchnic (duodenum, liver, pancreas and spleen) blood flows were measured with 25-mu radioactive microspheres in anesthetized, open-chest dogs. The effects of nicotine (36 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) before and after selective alpha adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine, 1 mg/kg i.v.) and before and after combined alpha and beta adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine, 1 mg/kg i.v. and propranolol, 1 mg/kg i.v.) were evaluated. Before adrenergic blockade, nicotine increased arterial pressure (+82%) but had heterogeneous directional effects on regional blood flows: pancreas (-64%), duodenum (-33%), kidney cortex (-31%), kidney medulla (-17%), liver (+5%) and spleen (+71%). Vascular conductance was reduced in kidney cortex (-61%), kidney medulla (-57%), duodenum (-59%), liver (-46%) and pancreas (-79%) and was not altered in spleen. Selective alpha adrenergic blockade prevented the hypertensive response to nicotine, but heterogeneous changes in regional flows persisted: pancreas (-40%), spleen (-40%), kidney medulla (-35%), kidney cortex (-31%), liver (+50%) and duodenum (+74%). After combined alpha and beta adrenergic blockade, nicotine increased systemic arterial pressure (+75%) and decreased vascular conductance in all tissues. Results indicate: 1) a heterogeneous influence of nicotine in renal and splanchnic circulations associated with regional differences in activities of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors and 2) a potent nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor response in these circulations to nicotine after blockade of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "13": "The interaction of a bromoacetylated derivative of alprenolol (Alm-CO-CH2Br) with cardiac and lung beta adrenoreceptors was partially characterized. After a short incubation period, the concentration of Alm-CO-CH2Br that inhibited specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding by 50% in cardiac and lung membranes was 0.5 and 0.11 microM, respectively. The blockade was time-dependent and Scatchard analysis showed no change in the KD value for specific (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol binding but a loss of beta adrenoreceptor content after membrane pretreatment with Alm-CO-CH2Br. The blockade was not reversed by extensive membrane washing, although concurrent treatment with alprenolol fully protected whereas phentolamine had no protective effect. Alm-CO-CH2Br produced a dose-dependent blockade of heart and lung beta adrenoreceptors in vivo and the compound had little or no effect on the growth rate of the rat. Four hours after a single i.p. injection of Alm-CO-CH2Br at 35 mg/kg, the heart and lung beta adrenoreceptor content was decreased by 88 and 90%, respectively. The time required for complete recovery from irreversible beta adrenoreceptor blockade was about 200 hr in the heart and 650 hr in the lung. These results suggest that Alm-CO-CH2Br may be a useful probe for the beta adrenoreceptor both in vitro and for recovery studies in vivo.", 
    "14": "To investigate the nature of the variable response to inhaled histamine in monkeys, we performed dose-response curves in a group of 10 anesthetized Macaca mulatta monkeys before and after administration of propranolol and atropine in inhaled doses sufficient to produce significant beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade of airway smooth muscle. Animals were studied in a volume-displacement body plethysmograph and changes in pulmonary resistance (RL), dynamic compliance (Cdyn), frequency (f) and tidal volume (VT) were plotted against inhaled histamine concentration (0.016 to 64 mg/ml). Sensitivity to histamine was assessed by the concentrations producing a 50% increase in RL and a 50% decrease in Cdyn. A wide range of sensitivity (0.44 to 3.3 mg/ml for RL, 0.47 to 11.3 mg/ml for Cdyn) was found in this small group of animals, and this was not influenced by prior inhalation of propranolol. Atropine inhalation resulted in a marked decrease in sensitivity in all animals but did not reduce the variability of response.", 
    "15": "Neither stroke volume nor external cardiac work (the integral of pressure times flow during ejection) has been considered an important correlate of myocardial oxygen consumption. An initial set of experiments re-examined this question of independently varying heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and stroke volume in seven closed-chest, anesthetized dogs. This was achieved by cardiac pacing, a pressure control reservoir, phenylephrine infusion, and adjustment of arteriovenous shunts. Propranolol was used to minimize changes in contractility which might affect myocardial oxygen consumption. Stroke volume in the form of external work had a significant effect on oxygen consumption. From these results, a new pressure-work index of myocardial oxygen consumption was devised, and fitting parameters for the following indexes were determined: systolic pressure-rate product, estimated wall tension, external left ventricular work, triple product, mean pressure-rate product, Et (Bretschneider), and tension-time index. These indexes were prospectively applied to a second set of experiments in 11 closed-chest, anesthetized dogs given norepinephrine, isoproterenol, dobutamine, Nembutal, and propranolol to alter myocardial contractility. Inotropic oxygen wasting was observed with the tension-time, mean pressure-rate, triple product, and estimated wall tension indexes, but not with the pressure-work or systolic pressure-rate indexes. It is concluded that stroke work is an important correlate of myocardial oxygen consumption, and that the pressure-work of systolic pressure-rate indexes can account for catecholamine-induced, changes in myocardial oxygen consumption without postulating an oxygen-wasting effect.", 
    "16": "Primary reaggregate cultures from 17-day embryonic mouse brains were prepared and tested for beta -adrenergic response. Isoproterenol stimulated the production of cAMP 3- to 4-fold over basal levels after 10 days in culture. The response to isoproterenol was rapid, reaching a maximum 1-2 min after stimulation, and was blocked by propranolol. The beta-adrenergic receptor was characterized in membranes prepared from reaggregates by measurement of specific binding of [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (IHYP). The Kd for IHYP was 100-300 pM and did not change as a function of time in culture. A maximum receptor density of approximately 80-110 fmol/mg membrane protein was found. Both beta-adrenergic receptors and response appeared at times in culture, which were approximately equivalent to birth.", 
    "17": "The role of coronary artery spasm in the production of angina at rest is emphasized. Three case reports of variant angina are presented to illustrate the spectrum of presentation and to stress the principles underlying the therapy of coronary artery spasm. This entity should be suspected and diagnosed more frequently in order that patients may derive the benefit of relatively specific therapy which consists of calcium antagonists and long-acting nitrates.", 
    "18": "Electrical stimulation of the nucleus parabrachialis (NPB) and surrounding areas of the dorsolateral pons in anesthetized immobilized cats elicits a rise of arterial pressure (AP) and tachycardia: the parabrachial pressor response (PBPR). The most excitable sites were concentrated within the intermediate one-third of the NPB in its medial and lateral subdivisions. The magnitude of pressor responses and their stimulus sensitivity were substantially greater in NPB than in adjacent areas of the dorsal pons including nucleus locus coeruleus and brachium conjunctivum, suggesting that cardiovascular responses heretofore attributed to locus coeruleus may have been due to excitation of the NPB. The PBPR persisted after chronic cerebellectomy, acute transection of the brain stem at the lower midbrain, or acute bilateral lesions of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), the latter abolishing baroreceptor reflexes. Thus the PBPR cannot be attributed to antidromic or orthodromic stimulation or from NTS. Change in blood flow and regional vascular resistances during the PBPR were measured by electromagnetic flow meters placed on the thoracic aorta, superior mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries. When elicited with stimuli 5 times threshold, the PBPR was associated with an 80% increase in AP, 14+ increase in heart rate, 25% increase in cardiac output, and a 42% increase in total peripheral resistance. There was a differentiated vasoconstriction in the order of superior mesenteric greater than renal greater than femoral arteries. The baroreflex elicited by electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve was reduced during stimulation of the NPB. The tachycardia was abolished by bilateral vagotomy, combined with beta-adrenergic blockade. Such treatment attenuated but did not abolish the hypertension which was only eliminated by subsequent alpha-adrenergic blockade. Thus the hypertension caused by stimulation of NPB is a result both of an increase of total peripheral resistance and of cardiac output. The cardiovascular pattern of the PBPR differ from other responses elicited from the dorsal pons, including the defense response, and the response to cerebral ischemia. We conclude that a powerful cardiovascular response pattern is organized within intrinsic neurons of the NPB. This nucleus may play an important role in organization of cardiovascular control by brain.", 
    "19": "This study attempted to quantify the incidence of drug interactions in general practice prescribing in Victoria. We used a computer program to search 428 prescriptions and associated medication records for possible interactions. We made 2445 drug/drug comparisons; the computer program generated 37 possible interaction alerts, none of which warranted a change in therapy. This type of computer program, unless extremely sophisticated, can only serve as a primary alert; a health professional should then check the validity of interactions it identifies.", 
    "20": "We studied the efficacy and tolerability of metoprolol, administered alone or in combination therapy, in 703 hypertensive patients. We observed a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients treated with metoprolol alone or with metoprolol and a diuretic. Of these, 60% to 85% achieved a diastolic blood pressure of 12 kPa (90 mmHg) or lower during the 12-week trial. The maximum effect occurred after approximately three weeks. In the majority of patients, 100 mg twice a day controlled mild to moderate hypertension. Side effects (mainly gastrointestinal disturbances and dizziness) occurred in 15% of patients receiving metoprolol alone and led to treatment withdrawal in 6.7%. For the total patients population, these frequencies were 13.5% and 6.7% respectively, and decreased with time. Asthmatics and diabetics tolerated metoprolol extremely well, indicating the clinical importance of metoprolol's cardioselectivity.", 
    "21": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist, timolol, was previously shown to exert a protective effect in cats subjected to 5 h of myocardial ischemia. The present study was designed to determine the effect of timolol on infarct size in cats 24 h after coronary occlusion. Timolol (25 microgram/kg) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was administered 0.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 h after acute ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. There was no significant difference in arterial blood pressure or heart rate in MI cats receiving timolol or vehicle. Timolol markedly decreased S-T segment elevation at 2-12 h (P less than 0.05). Left ventricular weights in MI + vehicle cats (8.5 +/- 0.7 g, n = 6) were similar to timolol-treated MI cats (8.9 +/- 0.4 g, n = 7). However, the percent of the left ventricular myocardium infarcted, determined by nitroblue tetrazolium staining, was significantly less (P less than 0.001) in timolol MI cats compared to saline-treated cats, 9.8 +/- 1.2% (n = 7) vs. 18.9 +/- 1.8% (n = 6), respectively. Hemodynamic or cytoprotective actions of timolol do not appear to explain these results. Rather, the mechanism of infarct size reduction by timolol is probably explained by antagonism of beta-receptor-mediated metabolic effects.", 
    "22": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist, [3H]dihydroalprenolol, was used to label binding sites in crude rat myocardial plasma membranes. The specificity of binding was dependent on the temperature of the assay. Specific binding at 22 and 37 degree C and at concentrations of radioligand less than 5 nM was consistent with binding to the myocardial beta-receptor. Binding sites labeled at 4 degree C possessed quite different properties. Binding was non-stereoselective and of lower affinity. Agonist compounds were much less effective at competing for the labeled myocardial sites at 4 degree C than at 22 degree C. Those beta-antagonists which additionally possess pharmacological \"quinidine-like' activity (e.g. propranolol, alprenolol) were potent competitors at 4 degree C, but competition was non-stereoselective. In contrast atenolol, a beta-antagonist devoid of \"quinidine-like' activity was ineffective at 4 degree C. Furthermore, procaine, and quinidine itself were potent competitors of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding at 4 degree C. Thus the specificity of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to rat heart membranes at 4 degree C appears to be directed non-stereoselectively at that portion of the competing molecule which recognized \"quinidine-like' as opposed to adrenergic activity.", 
    "23": "Experiments were performed to determine the effects of yohimbine, piperoxan, and mianserin on the flash-evoked afterdischarge (FEAD) in rat. All three drugs are alpha-adrenergic antagonists, which block the inhibition of norepinephrine-release mediated by presynaptic (alpha 2) receptors. It was predicted that these drugs would exert dose-dependent biphasic effects on FEAD: at low doses, which act presynaptically, the FEAD would be suppressed; while at higher doses, which also block postsynaptic (alpha 1) receptors, the FEAD would be disinhibited. The dose response curves for yohimbine and piperoxan were, in fact, biphasic with low doses decreasing the amount of FEAD, while higher doses returned the amount of FEAD to baseline. No biphasic effect was seen with mianserin. These observations are consistent with the fact that yohimbine and piperoxan are more potent antagonists at alpha 2- than at alpha 1-receptors, whereas the affinities of mianserin for the two receptor types is comparable. The results of these experiments support the hypothesis that norepinephrine modulates FEAD.", 
    "24": "A prospective, randomised, double-blind study was performed to compare the effects of propranolol and placebo on sudden cardiac death in a high-risk group of patients who survived acute myocardial infarction. Altogether 4929 patients with definite acute myocardial infarction were screened for inclusion: 574 (11.6%) died before randomisation, and 3795 (77%) were excluded. Five hundred and sixty patients aged 35 to 70 years were stratified into two risk groups and randomly assigned treatment with propranolol 40 mg four times a day or placebo. Treatment started four to six days after the infarction. By one year there had been 11 sudden deaths in the propranolol group and 23 in the placebo group (p less than 0.038, two-tailed test analysed according to the \"intention-to-treat\" principle). Altogether there were 25 deaths in the propranolol group and 37 in the placebo group (P less than 0.12), with 16 and 21 non-fatal reinfarctions respectively. A quarter of the patients were withdrawn from each group. Withdrawal because of heart failure during the first two weeks of treatment was significantly more common among propranolol-treated patients than among the controls, but thereafter the withdrawal rate was the same. The significant reduction in sudden death was comparable with that after alprenolol, practolol, and timolol, which suggests that the mechanism of prevention is beta-blockade rather than any other pharmacological property of the individual drugs.", 
    "25": "The acute neurological crisis is the most significant complication of variegate and acute intermittent porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. If it is managed correctly, the mortality rate should be negligible. An outline is given of the major symptoms and signs encountered in the acute attack, and the therapy which should be used for their relief is discussed. Mention is made of forms of treatment which may decrease the activity of the haem biosynthetic pathway and thus specifically influence the clinical problems.", 
    "26": "14 males at the age of 49 +/- 6.4 years with condition after myocardial infarction were loaded on the bicycle ergometer according to the criteria of the WHO. After injection of a beta-receptor blocker at the submaximal functional level the product of the pressure frequency decreased by 25% and the watt-pulse increased by 17%. The oxygen pulse and the respiratory quotient remained constant. An additional injection of glycosides did not significantly change these parameters. At the same time no falsely positive evidence concerning the behaviour of the ST-distance as criterium of withdrawal was provoked. The results of the submaximal and symptom-limited function were not falsified in the therapy with beta-receptor-blockers and glycosides, when the criteria of withdrawal recommended by the WHO are used unchangedly.", 
    "27": "Myocardial infarction in rats was produced by ligation of the left coronary artery. To ensure exact comparison of drug effect, the extent of the myocardial zone excluded from the coronary circulation was determined in each animal, and the experimental data were related to it. For this purpose, the hearts were perfused with Evans blue, and after the photometric determination of the dye content of the hearts the percentage of ischemic myocardium was calculated. With metoprolol, propranolol, and verapamil a significant increase of the survival times was obtained (min/% of non-ischemic myocardium). Metoprolol and propranolol also significantly increased the survival rates. None of the beta-blockers exerted an antiarrhythmic effect. The arrhythmias were prevented by higher doses of the calcium antagonist verapamil which, however, decreased the survival times. All beta-blocking agents delayed the typical elevation of the ST-segment in the electrocardiogram, and reduced the increase of the activity of the serum creatine kinase. Propranolol and metoprolol antagonized the blood pH decrease obtained after coronary occlusion. Results concerning heart rate, and arterial and central venous pressures are also reported. - The findings with metoprolol, especially, indicate that the essential mechanism in the therapeutic action of beta-blockers is their ability to block the cardiac beta 1-receptors.", 
    "28": "10 patients with systemic essential arterial hypertension have been treated with 200 mg/die of Metoprolol. The systolic times have been valued before and after the treatment. It has been observed a reduction of the pre-ejection period simultaneously and proportionally to the reduction of the arterial pressure and the cardiac frequence. These last parameters and the indices of consumption of oxygen and heart frequence have undergone a significant decrease since the first week of therapy. The bloodless indices which express the myocardic contractility demonstrated instead not to be particularly influenced.", 
    "29": "In eleven subjects with normal blood-pressure, but with reactive blood-hypertension revealed by bicycle ergometer testing, oral acebutolol in single daily dose of 400 mg was administered. The controls performed after thirty days of treatment have pointed out a significant improvement of the anomaly and a good compliance of the subjects at the therapy.", 
    "30": "A series of 184 pregnancies in 161 hypertensive women was classified according to the regimen of antihypertensive treatment used during pregnancy. In 72 pregnancies management was with bed rest alone, attaining a mean gestation of 37.8 +/- 0.4 weeks, a mean birthweight of 2941 +/- 97 g with 38 percent of infants below the 25th percentile. Late deterioration of hypertension with development of proteinuria occurred in 16.6 percent with fetal mortality of 6.9 percent. Antihypertensive therapy involved methyldopa, thiazide diuretics, sympathetic ganglion blockers, hydralazine, beta-adrenergic blockers and the combination of oxprenolol and prazosin. Fetal growth was compared in pregnancies that reached term on the various regimens. Significantly better growth was achieved where debrisoquine plus a thiazide were used (3617 +/- 113 g in six subjects) and oxprenolol/prazosin (3411 +/- 72 g in 14 subjects) compared to 11 comparably hypertensive patients on bed rest alone (2975 +/-87 g). Therapy with the ganglion blocker plus thiazide was complicated by the deterioration of hypertension with proteinuria in 37.2 percent of women; this did not occur in patients receiving oxprenolol/prazosin. Maternal age had no effect on fetal growth, but smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day caused significant growth retardation.", 
    "31": "Liver plasma membrane adenylate cyclase was stimulated paradoxically by an alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism under conditions of low metal ion and low GTP concentrations. In untreated membranes, epinephrine stimulation was GTP-dependent and was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors since it was completely blocked by propranolol, but unaffected by dihydroergocryptine. Pre-treatment of membranes to remove or reduce divalent cations and guanine nucleotides changed epinephrine stimulation to a form that was mediated by alpha 2-receptors since it was completely blocked by dihydroergocryptine, phenoxybenzamine and yohimbine, but not by propranolol or prazosin. The pre-treatment did not alter enzyme activation by isoproterenol or glucagon, alpha 2-Adrenergic stimulation of adenylate cyclase in depleted membranes required the presence in the assay of 1-2 mM Mg2+ and small amounts of exogenous GTP (less than or equal to 50 nM). Increasing the Mg2+ or GTP concentration in the assay produced a progressive reversal of epinephrine-stimulated activity from an alpha 2-adrenergic form to a predominantly beta-adrenergic form. Readdition of Ca2+ or Mg2+, but not Mn2+, into depleted membranes by incubation in the presence of metal reestablished the pattern of enzyme sensitivity to epinephrine to that seen with untreated membranes i.e., it changed from alpha 2- to beta-receptor mediation. Alterations in membrane and assay content of metal ions and GTP did not result in the activation of the enzyme by vasopressin or angiotensin II. These findings demonstrate the ability of Ca2+, Mg2+ and GTP to control the coupling of beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors with liver adenylate cyclase. It is hypothesized that the cations act by regulating the interaction of the receptors with adrenergic agonists and/or the guanine nucleotide binding protein(s) which is postulated to be involved in control of the enzyme.", 
    "32": "The binding characteristics of the alpha 1-selective adrenergic ligand [3H]-prazosin were determined in particulate membranes of rat lung from day 18 of gestation to adulthood. Specific binding was present at all ages studied, was reversible and inhibition of specific binding by agonists followed the order of potency: (-)-epinephrine = (-)-norepinephrine much greater than (-)-isoproterenol greater than (+)-norepinephrine. Inhibition by antagonists followed the order of potency: prazosin greater than WB4101, much greater than yohimbine. Binding capacity increased during the neonatal period from 52 +/- 9 fmoles x mg-1 protein in lung preparations on day 18 of a 21 day gestation increasing to 105 +/- 4 fmoles x mg-1 protein (mean +/- SE) by postnatal day 15. Binding activity decreased thereafter, reaching adult levels by 28 days of postnatal age, 62 +/- 3 fmoles x mg-1 protein. This pattern of alpha 1-adrenergic receptor density was distinct from that of beta-adrenergic receptors identified in rat lung membrane with the beta- adrenergic antagonist, (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol ((-)-[3H]DHA). (-)-[3H]DHA binding increased dramatically during this same time period, from 46 +/- 4 fmoles x mg-1 protein on day 18 of gestation to 496 +/- 44 fmoles x mg-1 protein in the adult lung. Affinity for [3H]-prazosin and (-)-[3H]DHA did not change with age. Pulmonary alpha 1-adrenergic receptors are present as early as 18 days of gestation in the rat and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor density is maximal by 15 days of postnatal age. The timing of the changes in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors correlates with the timing of increased sympathetic innervation of the developing rat lung and is distinct from that of beta-adrenergic receptor sites.", 
    "33": "The optimal daily dose and dose regimen of a new drug combination (Pertenso), consisting of 10 mg bemetizide, 20 mg triamterene, 20 mg dihydralazine and 20 mg bupranolol were tested in 14 hypertensive outpatients (WHO I to III) in a single blind crossover trial. The mean blood pressure before treatment was 183/107 +/- 5/2 mm Hg (+/-SEM) and was lowered to a mean blood pressure of 147/89 +/- 4/4 mm Hg (+/- SEM; p less than 0,005) during a multiple dose regimen and to 141/84 +/- 3/3 mm Hg (+/- SEM; p less than 0,005) during a single dose regimen. The results indicate that even in hypertension which requires a combination of diuretics, vasodilators and beta-adrenergic blocking agents for treatment, a fixed combination of these substances could be given for effective blood pressure control. The data suggest the possibility of a single dose regimen of the fixed drug combination.", 
    "34": "The role of dopamine (DA) in diet-induced thermogenesis was examined. DA was found in, and released from the sympathetic nerves supplying brown adipose tissue. However, the release of DA was only approximately 10% of that of noradrenaline. No significant re-uptake of DA was observed. Hyperphagic, cafeteria-fed rats exhibited higher rates of resting oxygen consumption (VO2) and increased DA release and turnover in brown adipose tissue relative to control animals. Pimozide completely abolished the difference in VO2 between the two groups and DA (0.5 mg . kg-1 s.c.) stimulated VO2 in control and cafeteria animals.", 
    "35": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the determination of (R)- and (S)-alprenolol and (R)- and (S)-metoprolol in human plasma. Separation of the enantiomers was accomplished after preparation of diastereomeric derivatives with symmetrical anhydrides of tert.-butoxycarbonyl-L-leucine followed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid at 0 degree C to remove the tert.-butoxycarbonyl group. The separations of the diastereomeric derivatives were performed using a reversed-phase system with muBondapak C18 as support and phosphate buffer pH 3.0 with the addition of acetonitrile as the mobile phase. High stability of the chromatographic system was achieved. The reproducibilities in the determination of (R)- and (S)-alprenolol and (R)- and (S)-metoprolol in human plasma were 9.4 and 9.8% (relative standard deviation) for alprenolol and metoprolol, respectively, at drug levels of 0.5 ng/ml. In two subjects who received single oral doses of alprenolol (100-mg tablet) and metoprolol (50-mg tablet) the plasma levels of the (R)-isomers were lower than for the (S)-isomers.", 
    "36": "An analysis of Hofstee plots of specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding in the presence of various concentrations of practolol showed that KD and Bmax in beta 1-subtype adrenoceptors were 19.2-fold lower and 2.76-fold higher than those in beta 2-subtype in adult rat hearts, respectively. Neonatal treatment with 6-hydroxydopa produced a significant increase only in Bmax in beta 1-adrenoceptors without changing Bmax and KD in beta 2-receptors. \"Up' regulation in the density of beta 2-type of adrenoceptors seems to be caused by the 6-hydroxydopa-induced sympathetic lesion.", 
    "37": "The inhibition of spontaneous contractile activity in isolated cat colon strips by isoprenaline, prenalterol and terbutaline was studied. Isoprenaline produced a concentration-dependent complete inhibition with an EC50 of 6.18 nM. Prenalterol and terbutaline produced a concentration-dependent partial inhibition of 68 and 75% respectively, with EC50 of 0.52 and 0.43 microM respectively. The inhibitory effects of the three agonists were blocked by metoprolol and IPS 339 in such a way as to suggest that the prenalterol effect was mediated by beta 1-adrenoceptors and the terbutaline effect was mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas the effect of isoprenaline appeared to be mediated by both types of receptors. Thus, the results indicate that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the adrenergic inhibition of spontaneous contractile activity in the cat colon strip. Qualitative effects of prenalterol and terbutaline on the spontaneous contractile activity in the cat colon strip indicated that the beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects may be related to inhibition of the activity in cholinergic neurons, whereas the beta 2-adrenoceptors may be acting on the smooth muscle cells per se.", 
    "38": "The pharmacokinetics after oral administration of the beta-blocker metipranolol (Disorat) were investigated in 20 patients with liver cirrhosis, 8 of them with portocaval shunt. Twenty healthy persons were used as controls. Kinetic data in patients were not notably different from the normal group, in particular there was no significant difference in the mean serum concentration over 24 hours. In patients with advanced disease the only noteworthy difference was an increase of the linear rate of increase of serum concentrations. Maximal serum concentrations were found with a median of only 0,37 and 0,59 hours after intake, and in controls 0,76 hours after intake. It appears that metipranolol has no hepatic first-pass-effect and that its total clearance remains largely uninfluenced even in severe liver damage. A reduction of dosage in these diseases is thus not required from the pharmacological point of view.", 
    "39": "Twenty patients (mean age 49 +/- 4 (SEM) yr) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were studied during placebo conditions, following 6 weeks of chlorthalidone monotherapy and 6 to 28 weeks of combined beta-blocker-chlorthalidone treatment, or vice versa. Compared to chlorthalidone therapy alone, addition of a beta-blocker to this diuretic caused a further blood pressure reduction in 11 patients (Responders); in 9 patients addition of a beta-blocking agent failed to further reduce blood pressure (Non-responders). Supine and upright plasma renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine and epinephrine levels and catecholamine excretion rates were always comparable between Responders and Non-responders. In both groups plasma and urinary norepinephrine or epinephrine values were not significantly altered following addition of a beta-blocker; heart rate and plasma renin activity were decreased in both groups to a similar extent. It is concluded that the antihypertensive mechanism of beta-blockers given to diuretic treated patients with essential hypertension is independant of renin and not associated with changes in plasma or urinary catecholamines.", 
    "40": "When adult Richardson's ground squirrels, born in the wild, are kept in the laboratory under light:dark cycles of 14:10 (lights out at 2000 h), pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin levels begin to rise shortly after lights out; both reach peak levels by 4 h into the dark phase. The rise in pineal NAT activity is partially blocked by phentolamine, an alpha-receptor blocker, and totally blocked by propranolol, a beta-receptor blocker. Phentolamine had no inhibitory influence on the nocturnal rise in pineal melatonin while propranolol partially prevented the increase in melatonin. Isoproterenol, a beta-receptor agonist, seemed to stimulate both NAT activity and the melatonin content in the pineal gland of the Richardson's ground squirrel. In the final study adult squirrels were kept in either 10 h of darkness at night or they were exposed to light (intensity = 370-400 ftc) during the normal period of darkness. Groups of squirrels were killed at 2000, 2400, 0200, 0400 and 0800 h. Darkness was associated with a marked rise in both pineal NAT activity and melatonin content. However, even when the squirrels were kept in light during the normal dark period, the activity of the acetylating enzyme and melatonin levels rose greatly and reached peak values at 0400 h.", 
    "41": "The effects of an antianginal agent, N,N-diethyl-5-methyl[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-7-amine (trapidil, Rocornal) (5-10 mg/kg), on regional myocardial function were studied in 17 open-chest dogs. The animals were instrumented with a micromanometer for measurement of left ventricular pressure, an electromagnetic flow probe around the left circumflex coronary artery, and 3 pairs of ultrasonic crystals in control, marginal and ischemia-induced segments. In cases of an intact coronary artery, trapidil increased peak dP/dt by 48%, heart rate by 19%, and coronary blood flow by 40%. End-diastolic segment length decreased by 7% with an increase of 17% in shortening. Coronary occlusion increased end-diastolic length of all three segments. In the ischemic segment, active shortening was rapidly replaced by systolic expansion. In the marginal segment, percent shortening decreased by 58%, while in the control segment, shortening was augmented by 11%. Trapidil administered during coronary occlusion significantly improved the shortening of control and marginal segments, as associated with a reduction in end-diastolic length. There was no significant change in function of the ischemic segment. These effects of tripidil during coronary occlusion were not blocked by propranolol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg). These data suggest that trapidil may be an effective treatment for left ventricular failure due to myocardial ischemia by virtue of its potent positive inotropic effects associated with substantial increases in myocardial blood supply sufficient to counteract the increase in oxygen consumption.", 
    "42": "The single and combined effects of acute phencyclidine (PCP) and propranolol, each given intraperitoneally, were studied on rat behavior. PCP (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) produced dose-related stereotypy and increases in (photocell) hyperactivity over 4 h observation. Propranolol (10 and 25 mg/kg) neither caused any stereotypy nor had any effect on activity relative to vehicle control. Additionally, propranolol (10 and 25 mg/kg), given 30 min after PCP (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg), reduced or completely blocked the stereotypy and hyperactivity caused by PCP. These data provide the first experimental verification of a clinical observation that propranolol may be an effective antagonist of the behavioral toxicity produced by PCP.", 
    "43": "Glycerol dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.6] (pI 5.9) from Geotrichum candidium is effectively adsorbed in the presence of 20 mM acute buffer (pH 6.0) on either octyl-Sepharose or 10-carboxydecyl-Sepharose, among ten different kinds of n-alkyl-Sepharose derivatives tested, some of which have an amino or a carboxyl group as a terminal residue. The enzyme adsorbed on 10-carboxydecyl-Sepharose is 95% eluted with 0.26 M NaCl. n-Propanol (10% and 15%, but not 5%), and various nucleotides such as NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, AMP, ADP, and ATP (1 mM) are also effective for elution. The elution with nucleotides is facilitated by 5% n-propanol. On the other hand, the enzyme adsorbed on octyl-Sepharose is not eluted under the conditions described above. These results suggest that the adsorption-elution of the enzyme on 10-carboxydecyl-Sepharose is due to a combination of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion between a specific locus of the enzyme surface and the 10-carboxydecyl residue. Experimental conditions are described under which the enzyme can be purified 266-fold with a yield of 79% by a single chromatography of the cell extract on a 10-carboxydecyl-Sepharose column.", 
    "44": "An experimental animal model was used to compare the effect of the two drug interventions on myocardial ischemia. Elevation of the ST segment on epicardial electrocardiogram in response to temporary occlusion of the coronary artery was used as an index of ischemia. For multiple sites distal to the left-anterior descending coronary artery (LADCA), ST segments were obtained, measured, and totaled (sigma ST). The effects of halothane (1.1% end-tidal concentration) were compared with those of a combination of nitroprusside and propranolol. The combination was given in a dosage that produced values for systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and maximal positive left-ventricular dP/dt (LV dP/dt) that were similar to those produced by halothane. Control measurements were obtained during chloralose-urethrane anesthesia. Both drug interventions reduced systemic blood pressure, heart rate, and left-ventricular dP/dt similarly. Occlusion of the left-anterior descending coronary artery alone did not change any of these hemodynamic variables. Although both drug interventions reduced sigma ST, the reduction was statistically significantly greater with halothane than with nitroprusside-propranolol.", 
    "45": "Intraamnial administration of isoproterenol (IPRO) to chick embryo induces different types of pathological changes of the myocardial and liver tissue: their character depends upon the developmental period during which the drug was administered. Analysis of the embryotoxic effect of IPRO has revealed that the time-course of in vivo uptake of [3H]IPRO by the developing heart appears to present the same pattern as the embryonic liver tissue; both peak values (10 min and 6 h after injection) were, however, significantly higher in the liver as compared with the myocardium. IPRO is rapidly metabolized to 3-o-methyl-IPRO; the proportion of this fraction in both organs represents approximately 40% of total radioactivity as early as 5 min after administration. Intraamnial administration of IPRO significantly increases the cAMP content in the myocardium; dibutyryl cAMP-induced myocardial lesions occurred, however, only occasionally and in comparison with IPRO they were significantly less pronounced. The cardiotoxic effect of IPRO can be significantly reduced by beta-blockade; calcium antagonist, verapamil, was found to have no protective effect. Our results suggest that the following factors may participate in the IPRO-induced embryotoxicity: (1) IPRO, (2) its toxic metabolites, (3) cAMP.", 
    "46": "Recent studies indicate that propranolol suppresses the normal murine lymphocyte mitogen dose-response(1) and that propranolol has a high affinity for the beta-adrenergic binding site on the murine lymphocyte(2). Since concentrations which suppress the lymphocyte mitogen dose-response are much greater than the Kd for the binding site, it may be suggested that the suppression of the mitogen dose-response is a result of nonspecific effects of propranolol. Three fluorescent probes (1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), fluorescein conjugated concanavalin A (F-Con A), and 3,3'-dithio-diisopropyl-oxacarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-(5)) were used to investigate possible mechanisms of the nonspecific effects of propranolol on the murine splenic lymphocyte. This report presents data which suggests a possible relationship between propranolol concentrations that alter lipid membrane dynamics, as monitored by the fluorescence polarization of DPH, and suppression of the mitogen dose-response in short term cell cultures as effected by propranolol. Also reported are effects of propranolol on the relative mobility of surface membrane lectin receptors as monitored by the fluorescence polarization of F-Con A, effects of propranolol on the transmembrane potential as monitored by fluorescence emission of diS-C3-(5), and the propranolol effect on fluorescence polarization temperature-dependence of DPH and F-Con A. Studies of the effects of sotalol, alprenolol, and metoprolol are included and used for the comparison of different drug effects.", 
    "47": "Introduction of L-timolol maleate into the clinics for glaucoma treatment has been a great success as it produces relatively few side effects, such as miosis, ciliary spasm and headache, which are associated with the use of pilocarpine. Recent reports indicated, however, that L-timolol produces asthmatic attacks, cardiovascular suppression and central depression. D-Timolol was found to be as effective as L-timolol in lowering the intraocular pressure and aqueous humor production. However it was much less potent than L-timolol in inhibiting cardiac contractility and heart rate stimulated by isoproterenol and was less active in blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in tracheal muscle. It is suggested that the D-isomer of timolol could be used to treat glaucoma instead of L-isomer without producing untoward side effects in cardiovascular and bronchial tissues.", 
    "48": "In the present study, myocardial infarction was induced experimentally in rats by isoprenaline injection. Circulating GOT, LDH, CPK, cAMP, Cortisol, pyruvate, lactate glucose and cardiac cAMP adenyl cyclase levels were gradually increased and serum and cardiac cAMP-PDE levels were gradually decreased from 1 hour to 120 hours after the first injection of isoprenaline. In the rats pretreated with ciplar (beta blocker) or Pushkarmula (indigenous drug) these changes were less when compared to untreated infarcted rats. Similar type of results were also observed in the infarcted rats post treated with Pushkarmula. The pretreatment with Pushkarmula was found to be more effective than post treatment which gives a preventive and curative bearing of the drug in myocardial infarction.", 
    "49": "One hundred and fifty-seven hypertensive patients (1st and 2nd degree of the WHO classification) studied in 15 hospitals were treated with labetalol at a dosage of 300-600 mg a day for 3 months. Nineteen patients did not complete the study because of the appearance of side effects, because of failure of the treatment to decrease the blood pressure, or for other reasons. Of the remaining 138 patients, 77 were treated with labetalol only, while in 61 a diuretic was added. The mean value of the systolic pressure decreased from 173 to 145 mmHg in the recumbent position and from 170 to 140 mmHg in the upright position. The diastolic pressure decreased from 111 to 92 mmHg in the recumbent position and from 113 to 92 mmHg in the upright position. All these differences are statistically significant (p less than 0,001). Heart rate was significantly reduced from 77 to 70 beats per minute in recumbent position and from 82 to 75 in the upright position, according to the action of the drug on the alpha and beta-receptors. Side-effects were mild and prompted the interruption of treatment in 3.2% of the patients. In conclusion this polycentric research confirms that labetalol has a good antihypertensive effect in patients with mild or moderate hypertension and that this effect can be achieved with a dosage equal or inferior to 600 mg a day. If with this dosage a satisfactory blood pressure level is not obtained, it is advisable to add a diuretic. With this combined treatment more than two thirds of cases (71%) have been satisfactorily controlled. The drug was well tolerated and postural hypotension was nearly always absent.", 
    "50": "The sympathetic and parasympathetic neurological cardiac effects were blocked with atropine and propranolol. The intrinsic heart rate (IHR) was determined and rapid atrial pacing (RAP) was carried out before and after administration of the drugs. The primary and secondary postpacing parameters were examined in both circumstances. Normal (n = 31) and pathological (n = 20) cases were differentiated on the basis of the IHR. In the secondary phase (PPC 2-10) after autonomic blockade returned to the basic frequency was of exponential character in the great majority of normal IHR cases. Anomalies may appear in both the primary and secondary phases. They are of different types: one of them concerns the recovery time; another electrophysiological anomaly occurs when there is no return to the predrive normal cycle length after pharmacological neurotomy. In the secondary phase there may appear sinoauricular blocks. They may depend on or appear independently of the effect of the vegetative nervous system. The new test allows a physiopathological classification of normal and pathological sinus node function.", 
    "51": "Healthy subjects aged 70-90 and 20-40 years were investigated for the level of reverse triiodothyronine (rT3). The mean level in 57 old subjects was higher and the triiodothyronine (T3) level lower than in 30 young persons. No negative correlation was observed. A serum T3 elevation caused by liothyronine administration (5-15 micrograms/day for two weeks) was not followed by a change of the mean rT3 level in 12 old subjects. After a single intramuscular thyrotropin (TSH) injection, the rT3 elevation lasted 24h longer in 19 old persons than in the 9 control ones, though the early rT3 response was similar in both groups. Propranolol administration (40 mg t.i.d. for a week) caused a similar rT3 elevation in old persons (n = 18) as in 12 young ones. From the indirect data it is concluded that the serum rT3 elevation in old age is a result of faster peripheral generation and not of increased production in the thyroid gland. The data do not indicate any change of rT3 metabolism. T4-T3 and T4-rT3 conversion are provoked by different enzymes. The elevation of rT3 might be a cause of the observed decrease in peripheral T3 generation in old subjects, acting by an inhibition of the T4-T3 conversion."
