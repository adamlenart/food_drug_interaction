The relaxation occurred in three cases: 1) when the elevated [K+]O was moderate (up to 40 mmol/l); 2) at the beginning of high [K+]O action (60-160 mmol/l); 3) when the [K+]O was elevated (up to 160 mmol/l) under the conditions of a calcium current blockade. In each case the relaxation was connected with slow depolarization of the smooth muscle cells membrane and depressed by beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol (10(-5) mol/l). The relaxant action of the high-potassium solution on the coronary smooth muscle is actualized via the noradrenaline release from intramural nerve endings.", 
    "1": "1. The role of adrenal medullary catecholamines in the regulation of cardiac function becomes more important when adrenergic neural influences in the heart are decreased. Since adrenergic nervous input to the heart decreases with age, it would be expected that catecholamine influence on cardiac neuroeffector junction would increase. 2. Fischer-344 rats of 6-, 12- and 24-months were adrenal demedullated or sham-operated and the animals were killed at the end of two weeks. beta-Adrenoceptors were studied in the membrane preparations from the ventricles of rat hearts. [125I]-iodopindolol was used as the radioligand. The density of beta-receptors (Bmax), dissociation constant (KD) and the ratio of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were studied. The relative percentages of beta-receptor subtypes were determined by use of ICI 89,406 (beta 1-selective antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective antagonist). 3. In 24-month-old animals which were adrenal demedullated, hydrocortisone replacement was employed for one week; the animals were killed one week later. 4. The data indicate that there was a diminution of the Bmax following adrenal demedullation at all ages but that the ratios of beta 1: beta 2-adrenoceptors remain the same as in the controls (67:33). The effect of adrenal medullary catecholamines on cardiac beta-receptor binding characteristics did not seem to be influenced by age.", 
    "2": "1. The effects of the beta 1-selective partial agonist xamoterol and the full agonist isoprenaline on rat cardiac beta-adrenoceptors were compared in functional studies of heart rate response in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the ability of both agents to cause receptor down-regulation in the rat heart following chronic (6 days) subcutaneous infusions was assessed by radioligand binding with [125I]-pindolol. 2. In the functional studies, xamoterol produced a maximal effect equivalent to approximately 65% of that of isoprenaline and was overall less potent than the full agonist. 3. Compared to saline control, the density of beta-adrenoceptors was reduced approximately 39% in ventricular membranes prepared from animals after 6 days of isoprenaline infusion but was unaffected by xamoterol. The relative proportions of the beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were unchanged by either active treatment. 4. Plasma xamoterol level at the end of the infusion period was equivalent to that associated with maximum tachycardia in vivo and to the concentration producing maximal stimulation of the rat isolated atrium in vitro. Thus suggesting 100% beta-adrenoceptor occupancy during the period of xamoterol infusion. 5. These results indicate that in this animal model xamoterol does not induce cardiac beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation during chronic treatment, with doses that produce a maximal functional response both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "3": "1. The relaxant effects to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline, adrenaline, noradrenaline, RO363, procaterol and fenoterol were investigated in carbachol-contracted mouse isolated tracheal preparations. 2. The order of potencies for those beta-adrenoceptor agonists that induced full relaxation of carbachol-contracted mouse tracheal preparations was isoprenaline greater than RO363 greater than noradrenaline = adrenaline greater than fenoterol. The EC50 value of isoprenaline for relaxation was 46 nM. The beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, RO363 was ten times more potent than the beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, fenoterol. The highly beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist procaterol was a partial relaxant and induced only 28 +/- 4% relaxation. 3. Relaxations induced by noradrenaline and isoprenaline were not significantly affected by the neuronal uptake inhibitor, cocaine (10 microM) or by the extraneuronal uptake inhibitor, deoxycorticosterone acetate (25 microM) respectively. The alpha-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine induced no observable elevation of mouse tracheal smooth muscle tone. 4. Schild plots for the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, atenolol and betaxolol (beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective) and ICI 118,551 (beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective) were linear, with slope values approaching unity. Mean pA2 values derived for atenolol, betaxolol and ICI 118,551 for antagonism of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation were 7.1, 8.4 and 7.2, respectively. These data were independent of the use of isoprenaline or noradrenaline as the agonist. 5. These findings indicate that beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations of mouse isolated trachea occur predominantly through activation of beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "4": "We investigated the effects of the physiological neurotransmitter norepinephrine on the contractile properties and Ca2+ dynamics of isolated cardiac myocytes, with particular emphasis on possible interactions between alpha- and beta-adrenergic effects. Individual rat ventricular myocytes were electrically stimulated at a frequency of 1 Hz. Norepinephrine (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) increased extent and velocity of shortening and decreased the contraction duration. beta-Adrenergic activation gave a greater enhancement of extent and velocity of shortening than did norepinephrine alone (i.e. alpha plus beta). Neither alpha 1 nor alpha 2 adrenergic activation individually produced a significant impact upon contraction. Using suspensions of myocytes loaded with Quin-2, we also studied resting levels of cytosolic Ca2+ ([ Ca2+]c), the increase of [Ca2+]c due to caffeine-addition (as an index of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content) and the subsequent increase in [Ca2+]c due to depolarization with 30 mM K+ (as an index of sarcolemmal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel activity). Norepinephrine decreased resting [Ca2+]c, increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content and increased Ca2+ channel activity. beta-Adrenergic activation produced the same effect on resting [Ca2+]c and sarcoplasmic reticulum content, but gave significantly greater activation of sarcolemmal Ca2+ channel activity, than did norepinephrine (alpha plus beta). By contrast, alpha-adrenergic stimulation had no effect on resting [Ca2+]c or sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content. We conclude that beta-mediated effects predominate in the action of the physiological agonist norepinephrine on cardiac myocytes. However, alpha (specifically alpha 1)-adrenergic effects are significant in diminishing the potentiation of the extent and velocity of shortening, and of depolarization-induced entry of Ca2+ into the cell, which is seen on beta-stimulation alone. Thus, there may be an intrinsic feedback effect in the actions of norepinephrine on the cardiac myocyte.", 
    "5": "In the present study beta-adrenergic receptors were identified and localized by autoradiographic methods using [125I]cyanopindolol in human eyes, as well as in the eyes of marmosets and albino rabbits. Quantification revealed that the highest binding-site densities are in the ciliary body and the corneal epithelium and endothelium. Moreover, the iris and conjunctiva showed significant amounts of specific [125I]cyanopindolol binding. In pigmented human and marmoset eyes, binding to the ciliary epithelium and iris was not inhibited by 10 microM propranolol, thus representing nonspecific binding sites. In nonpigmented rabbit eyes, binding to all parts of the eye was reduced to the level of background by 10 microM propranolol and 100 nM ICI 118-551, which is a highly selective beta 2-adrenergic ligand. Being selective for serotonin1B receptors, 100 nM ICI 89-406 which blocks more than 95% of the beta 1-adrenergic receptors, and RU 24,969 have no effect on [125I]cyanopindolol binding, which suggests that there is binding to beta 2-adrenergic receptors. The anatomical location and quantification of beta 2-receptors in the mammalian eye may contribute to better understanding of beta 2-adrenoceptor function and the action of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in glaucoma therapy.", 
    "6": "The pattern of changes in kinetic properties of beta-adrenoreceptor (Cd, c+ and c-) relative to anapriline adrenoblocker under conditions of muscle perfusion by catecholamines has been estimated on papillary cardiac muscles of the rat as based on the isometric voltage. A priority increase of the receptors' affinity to the blocker is determined, that may be a result of changes in microviscosity of the lipid sarcolemma bilayer.", 
    "7": "The possible occurrence and role of protein kinase C at the lateral olfactory tract (LOT)-pyramidal cell synapse of the rat olfactory cortex slice has been investigated by determining the effects of both activators (4-beta-phorbol-12,13,diacetate [PDAc] and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol) and inhibitors (5-isoquinolinylsulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine [H-7], sangivamycin and polymyxin B) of the enzyme on the surface field potential known as the N-wave. PDAc (0.3 to 20 mumol/l) and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (25 to 250 mumol/l) increased the area and amplitude of the potential. In control slices in which a population spike was recorded, PDAc also triggered the appearance of multiple spikes. In a series of input-output experiments, PDAc (2.5 or 5 mumol/l) increased the area and amplitude of the N-wave relative to that of the action potential but did not significantly affect pyramidal cell excitability. The effects of PDAc on the N-wave were antagonised by all three protein kinase C inhibitors but not by the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium and were greater in slices perfused with solution containing 10 rather than 1 mmol/l Mg2+ or 1.25 rather than 5 mmol/l Ca2+. The effect of PDAc on the amplitude but not area of the N-wave was blocked by the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (10 mmol/l) but not by 4-aminopyridine (0.25 mmol/l). In a series of conditioning experiments, PDAc (1 to 5 mumol/l) reduced the amplitude of the N-wave evoked by a second stimulus compared to that evoked by the first conditioning pulse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Several studies suggest that behavioral techniques such as meditation and relaxation may be associated with reduced end organ adrenergic receptor sensitivity. Thus far the evidence supporting this hypothesis has been indirect. We present preliminary findings showing reduced beta-adrenergic receptor sensitivity in a group of subjects practicing Transcendental Meditation. The meditation group (N = 10), compared to controls (N = 10), had a lower percentage of functional lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptors (p = 0.009), but showed no difference in total receptor number or plasma catecholamines. There were no differences between the groups in Type A behavior, the Type A components, exercise, or family history of hypertension. The results provide some support for studies postulating that meditation is associated with reduced sympathetic adrenergic receptor sensitivity, and provide encouragement for the efficacy of receptor measurement in psychophysiology research.", 
    "9": "The effect of electrical field stimulation (EFS) on smooth muscle strips from the chicken crop was investigated. The EFS (5 Hz, 2 ms, 400 mA; 10 Hz, 2 ms, 400 mA; 5 Hz, 2 ms, 500 mA; 10 Hz, 2 ms, 500 mA) produced contractions in all preparations. Atropine (10(-5) mol l-1) diminished muscle contraction in response to EFS. Tetrodotoxin (5 X 10(-6) mol l-1) fully suppressed the contractile responses to EFS. A serotonin antagonist (methysergide, 10(-4) mol l-1) did not alter contractions elicited by EFS. Propranolol (10(-5) mol l-1) led to an increase of contractions induced by EFS. Noradrenaline (10(-6)-10(-4) mol l-1) reduced acetylcholine-induced (1.1 X 10(-6) mol l-1) contraction of the crop smooth muscle strips. Propranolol (10(-5) mol l-1) abolished noradrenaline-induced relaxation almost fully. Tetrodotoxin (5 X 10(-6) mol l-1) did not change the relaxing effect of noradrenaline. These results suggested that the responses of crop smooth muscle to EFS involve excitatory cholinergic and non-cholinergic (probably peptidergic) as well as inhibitory adrenergic nerves.", 
    "10": "Characteristics of beta-adrenoceptor in the tracheal smooth muscle of Suncus murinus (suncus) were studied in comparison with those of rats and guinea pigs. Isoproterenol induced concentration-dependent relaxation of suncus trachea. However, the maximal relaxation was very small, and about 1000 times higher concentration was necessary compared to the case of the guinea pig. The order of the sensitivity to isoproterenol and the maximal relaxation was guinea pig much greater than rat greater than suncus. Tracheae from younger suncus were more sensitive to isoproterenol, but the maximal relaxation was not significantly different from the results using adult animals. Forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, relaxed tracheae to similar extents in the three species. Though the affinity of specific [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding was not significantly different, the maximal number of binding sites was in the order of rat greater than guinea pig greater than suncus. However, the differences in density of the binding among the three species were not as great as differences in isoproterenol-induced relaxation. These results suggest that 1) beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of tracheal smooth muscle is not well-developed in the suncus and 2) the deficient relaxation is probably caused by insufficient coupling between adrenoceptors and adenylate cyclase.", 
    "11": "The role of the autonomic nervous system in the modulation of the immune response to emotional stimuli, was established in rats subjected to the passive avoidance test. An increase in splenic primary antibody response directed against SRBC was found after exposure of rats to the passive avoidance apparatus (novelty). Both local surgical denervation of the spleen and beta-receptor blockade (timolol, 1 mg/kg i.p. 1 h prior to testing) prevented the increase in primary antibody response.", 
    "12": "beta-Adrenergic receptor binding characteristics and adenylate cyclase activity were examined in rat skeletal muscle membranes to determine if acute exercise or endurance training altered beta-receptors or adenylate cyclase activity in different muscle fiber types. Binding characteristics and adenylate cyclase activity were examined in type IIA [red fast-twitch, red vastus (RV)], type IIB [white fast-twitch, white vastus (WV)], and type I [red slow-twitch, soleus (S)] muscles. Acute exercise involved a 20-min run on a treadmill at 20 m/min and did not alter beta-receptor density or adenylate cyclase activity in any of the fiber types examined. Endurance training consisted of a progressive treadmill protocol that involved increasing intensity and duration of exercise for 18 wk. beta-Adrenergic receptor density increased in skeletal muscle fiber types primarily recruited during submaximal training (types I and IIA), whereas nonreceptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activity was altered in the three fiber types. Endurance training significantly increased beta-receptor density in RV by 25% and in S by 19% (P less than 0.05), whereas in WV beta-receptor density was not altered. Basal adenylate cyclase activity in RV was increased approximately 2.5 fold by endurance training. Nonreceptor-mediated adenylate cyclase activity, stimulated by NaF and forskolin, increased by approximately twofold in both RV and WV as a result of endurance training. The data support and extend previous observations to show greater effects of endurance training in types I and IIA fibers with respect to alterations in beta-receptor density and alterations in adenylate cyclase activity in each fiber type. Acute exercise did not alter these parameters either in trained or untrained rats.", 
    "13": "We investigated the mechanisms underlying the increase in mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) beta 2-adrenergic receptor (AR) number and responsiveness after acute infusion of catecholamines. Infusion of isoproterenol and epinephrine, but not of norepinephrine, acutely increased MNL beta-AR density, and this was blocked by the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 but not by the beta 1-selective antagonist bisoprolol, suggesting a beta 2-AR-mediated effect. Infusion of isoproterenol but not of norepinephrine also induced a lymphocytosis, with an increase in the number of circulating suppressor/cytolytic T (Ts/c)- and natural killer (NK)-cells but a decrease in helper T (Th)-cells, leading to a decreased Th-Ts/c-cell ratio. beta-AR density was higher in Ts/c-cells than in Th-cells. After isoproterenol infusion, beta-AR density was elevated in all lymphocyte subsets but not in monocytes or platelets, suggesting a lymphocyte-specific phenomenon. Infusion of isoproterenol in splenectomized patients did not alter lymphocyte subset composition and only slightly increased beta 2-AR density. In healthy subjects lymphocyte proliferation in response to various mitogens was attenuated after infusion of isoproterenol but not of norepinephrine; this effect was abolished in splenectomized patients. We conclude that the elevated MNL beta-AR density after acute exposure to beta-adrenergic agonists is caused by a release of lymphocyte subsets from the spleen into the circulation and/or by an exchange of lymphocyte subsets between the spleen and the circulation, whereby freshly released splenic lymphocytes appear to carry more beta-AR than those found in the circulation. This appears to impair immune responsiveness in a dual manner, by decreasing the Th-/Ts/c-cell ratio and by rendering lymphocytes more sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of catecholamines via a higher beta-AR density.", 
    "14": "Pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptors, which mediate the actions of endogenous catecholamines, increase before birth, an important step in pulmonary maturation. This increase, which occurs primarily in the alveoli, may be hastened by corticosteroids. However, because the lung is composed of more than 40 cell types, we asked whether the normal distribution of beta-adrenergic receptors changes with gestational age in a way that seems physiologically relevant. We compared lungs from fetal rabbits at 26 and 31 days' gestation with lungs from adult rabbits by autoradiography with 125iodocyanopindolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist. While the total silver grain concentration increased during gestation, the greatest proportional increase occurred in the alveoli. We conclude that pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptor concentration increases during gestation and that this increase is most dramatic for alveoli. This pattern is consistent with that previously observed after treatment of fetal rabbits in utero with corticosteroids.", 
    "15": "The age changes of neural control over the function of the thyroid, adrenal cortex and testicles were examined in adult (6 months) and old (28 months) male rats. In old age, there was a weakening of adrenergic control of thyroidogenesis, alpha-adrenergic and M-cholinergic control of glucocorticoid function of the adrenal cortex and reduction of adrenergic and M-cholinergic influences in the regulation of steroidogenic function of the testicles.", 
    "16": "In an effort to define the mechanisms regulating pulmonary vasodilatation and explain the greater in vitro response to iso-proterenol in the pulmonary artery (PA) vs. aorta (AO), we compared beta adrenergic receptor binding characteristics and coupling to adenylate cyclase in PA and AO obtained from adult male rats. Beta adrenergic receptor binding characteristics and affinity for agonists were determined with [125I]-iodocyanopindolol. Agonist displacement studies were characteristic of a beta-2 adrenergic receptor subtype. Receptor density (44.7 +/- 7.3 vs. 39.6 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg of protein means +/- S.E.M., PA vs. AO) and the dissociation constant for the radioligand (10.3 +/- 2.6 vs. 13.4 +/- 3.5 pM) were similar in the two arteries. However, affinity for l-isoproterenol was greater (the inhibition constant was lower) in PA compared to AO (0.08 +/- 0.03 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.18 microM, P less than .05), as was affinity for l-epinephrine (0.89 +/- 0.20 vs. 3.87 +/- 0.62 microM, P less than .05). Affinity was similar for l-norepinephrine (18.93 +/- 3.63 vs. 13.49 +/- 3.12 microM). Base-line cyclic AMP (cAMP) content, basal adenylate cyclase activity and adenylate cyclase activity stimulated by GTP, isoproterenol plus GTP and forskolin were measured by radioimmunoassay for cAMP. Base-line cAMP content was greater in PA than in AO (513.5 +/- 46.9 vs. 125.5 +/- 19.1 pmol of cAMP per mg of protein, P less than .001), as was basal adenylate cyclase activity (10.8 +/- 1.2 vs. 5.7 +/- 1.3 pmol of cAMP per mg of protein per min, P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "During lung development, beta adrenergic receptors undergo transient coupling to enzymes and physiological processes which govern respiratory function and trophic responses to neural stimulation. To determine the role of endogenous catecholamines in mediating these processes, we examined the gestational and postnatal effects of chronic propranolol infusion (10 mg/kg/day) throughout fetal development. The effectiveness of receptor blockade in dam and fetus were confirmed through measurements of heart rate and enzymatic stimulatory responses to acute challenge with beta agonists (terbutaline to isoproterenol). Propranolol antagonized the ability of terbutaline to stimulate fetal lung fluid resorption and phosphatidic acid phosphatase, a key enzyme in surfactant synthesis. After birth, basal lung compliance and the compliance response to beta adrenergic stimulation were compromised in the neonates that had been exposed to propranolol before birth, despite the fact that direct receptor antagonism had disappeared by that time. After weaning, animals exposed to prenatal propranolol showed interference with basal activity of ornithine decarboxylase (an enzyme involved in transduction of neuronal and hormonal trophic stimuli) and its response to acute beta adrenergic challenge. These results suggest that endogenous fetal catecholamines participate in perinatal respiratory adaptation to air-breathing and help to program future cellular responsiveness to neuronal input.", 
    "18": "1. One and four hours after acute or chronic (8 days) intraperitoneal injection of propranolol to rat at doses up to 25 mg/kg, a beta-adrenergic receptor blockage occurred in brain homogenates, as monitored by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding. 2. A dose-dependent increased methylation of chloroform extractable products was observed (acute treatment: 18% increase, chronic treatment: 136% increase for the dose of 25 mg/kg). 3. The implication of beta-adrenergic receptors in this effect was studied and this revealed that: (a) acute intraperitoneal injection of the less active propranolol stereoisomer (+) did not produce any effect; (b) the chronic intraperitoneal injection of salbutamol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, induced a decreased methylation of chloroform extractable products (62% decrease for the dose of 2.5 mg/kg). 4. It is concluded that injection of beta-adrenergic antagonist to the rat increases basal methyltransferase activity in the brain. This induces a decreased sensitivity of the enzyme activity to noradrenaline.", 
    "19": "1. The binding of [3H] dihydroalprenolol ((3H]DHA) to beta-adrenoceptors in cerebral cortex membranes (fraction P2) was studied after 13-day oral treatment of male Wistar rats with the Ca2(+)-antagonists nifedipine (20 mg/kg), verapamil (50 mg/kg), flunarizine (10 mg/kg) and with the calmodulin (CaM)-antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) (3 mg/kg). 2. A significant reduction in the number (Bmax) of binding sites for [3H]DHA was established after the 3 Ca2(+)-antagonists as well as after TFP. 3. No changes in the affinity values (Kd) [3H]DHA binding were found in all treated groups. 4. The fluidity characteristics of the cerebral cortex membranes in nifedipine- and flunarizine-treated rats did not differ from those in controls. 5. Based on these results, we concluded that long-term treatment with Ca2(+)- and calmodulin-antagonists might induce changes in the central adrenergic mechanisms.",

Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) were recorded simultaneously from the endocardium and the epicardium in open-chested dogs (n = 16) during bolus intravenous injections of potassium chloride at 0.1 mmol/kg and 0.2 mmol/kg. MAP duration was measured at 90% repolarization. Local conduction was measured as the delay between the pacing artefact and upstroke of the MAP. 2. The animals were anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose and urethane. Heart block was created by atrioventricular nodal ablation with 0.1% (v/v) formalin. Infra-nodal pacing was established. 3. Bolus injections of potassium chloride at 0.1 mmol/kg shortened MAP duration. The effect was maximal at 15 s after the injection [epicardium: 171.5 +/- 3.0 (control) and 148.9 +/- 5.2 ms at 15 s (P less than 0.001); endocardium: 178.7 +/- 4.4 (control) and 165.6 +/- 5.3 ms (P less than 0.001)].

    "21": "Interactions between different noradrenaline (NA)-active drugs and the benzodiazepine alprazolam (APZ) were examined in a modified Vogel's drinking conflict test in the rat. In a dose (0.5 mg/kg) which did not alter the behavior by itself, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine consistently was found to enhance the anticonflict effect of APZ (0.5 mg/kg). The yohimbine induced potentiation of the APZ effect was counteracted both by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.25 mg/kg) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0 mg/kg), but not by the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (2.0 mg/kg). Similar potentiating phenomena were obtained after co-administration of APZ (0.5 mg/kg) with the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist ST 587 (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) as well as with the suggested beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol (1.0 mg/kg). The results indicate that the potentiative effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists on BDZ induced anticonflict action may be due to increased stimulation of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptors, via enhanced NA release. The findings are discussed in relation to the signal-to-noise hypothesis of NA function, and in relation to the suggested NA involvement in anxiety-related behavior.", 
    "22": "Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) express the complete renin-angiotensin system and secrete angiotensins. In this study, we examined the adrenergic influence on the secretion of angiotensins from BAECs. Angiotensins were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. At basal state, BAECs contain angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III at concentrations of 2.5 +/- 1.3, 4.8 +/- 2.3, and 3.4 +/- 1.5 pg/10(6) cells, respectively. Angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin III concentrations in the culture medium were 8.3 +/- 4.4, 9.4 +/- 3.5, and 9.9 +/- 3.3 pg/10(6) cells, respectively. Isoproterenol (0.1-10 microM) increases secretion of angiotensins I, II, and III in a dose-dependent manner. Increase in angiotensin secretion induced by isoproterenol (10 microM) can be inhibited by beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (1 microM), but not by beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (1 microM). Forskolin (1-1,000 microM) mimics the isoproterenol-induced response. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (1-100 microM) inhibits the secretion. Pretreatment of BAECs with captopril (1 microM) inhibits the accumulation of angiotensin II and angiotensin III in the culture medium, but not angiotensin I. These findings suggest that BAEC production and/or secretion of angiotensins is regulated by adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "23": "The in vivo phosphorylation stoichiometries of 4 serines on the glycogen-binding (G)-subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) have been determined. In fed rabbits injected with propranolol stoichiometries (mol/mol) were: site 1 (0.67 +/- 0.09), site 2 (0.20 +/- 0.07), site 3a (0.23 +/- 0.01) and site 3b (0). After injection with adrenalin they became: site 1 (0.90 +/- 0.02), site 2 (0.72 +/- 0.01), site 3a (0.23 +/- 0.02) and site 3b (0). These results, together with other data, establish that site 2 phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase triggers dissociation of PP1 from the G-subunit in vivo. They also demonstrate that a residue phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (site 3a) is phosphorylated in vivo.", 
    "24": "To gain further knowledge on the role of ovarian hormones in the regulation of mammary beta-adrenergic receptors, virgin animals were killed during the various phases of the estrous cycle as well as after ovariectomy and treatment with sex steroid. beta-Adrenergic receptor levels fluctuate in the rat mammary gland during the estrous cycle, with higher receptor numbers during the proestrous and estrous phases of the cycle. Ovariectomy caused an almost 50% loss of beta-adrenergic receptor concentration in the mammary gland of virgin rats. Treatment of ovariectomized animals with 17 beta-estradiol or progesterone alone or in combination for 3 weeks induced a marked increase in beta-adrenergic receptor concentration, while administration of the androgen dihydrotestosterone did not modify mammary beta-adrenergic binding sites. While levels of beta-adrenergic receptors in control lactating animals (10 days of lactation) were elevated, chronic treatment with the dopaminergic-mimetic agent 2 alpha-bromoergocryptine (CB-154; for 7 days) reduced beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. Castration of lactating animals decreased beta-adrenergic receptor number to approximately 30% of the value in intact controls, while combined withdrawal of circulating ovarian hormones and inhibition of plasma PRL levels caused an almost complete inhibition of beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that the observed alterations in beta-adrenergic receptors resulted from changes in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites, with no change in binding affinities. The present findings indicate that the beta-adrenergic receptor population of the rat mammary gland is under the control of ovarian hormones and PRL and suggest that circulating or locally released catecholamines could interact with sex steroids and PRL in the regulation of mammary gland growth, differentiation, and activity.", 
    "25": "To investigate a possible role of catecholamines in mammary gland growth and differentiation, we have studied the characteristics of a specific beta-adrenergic receptor population during the different reproductive phases of the rat mammary gland, namely pregnancy and lactation. The functional response to mammary beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation was assessed by measurement of adenylate cyclase activity during the same physiological states of the gland [125I]Cyanopindolol (CYP) binds specifically to membranes prepared from lactating mammary glands. Scatchard analysis of the binding data shows the presence of a single class of high affinity sites, with an apparent Kd value of 25.0 +/- 0.4 pM and a binding capacity of 32.5 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein in lactating mammary glands at random stages of lactation. The order of potency of a series of agonists to compete for [125I]CYP binding is consistent with the interactions with a beta 2-subtype receptor. The binding of [125I]CYP to mammary glands also shows a marked stereoselectivity; the (-)isomers of isoproterenol and propranolol are more potent than their respective enantiomers. The radioautographic localization of [125I]CYP reveals the presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptors in the epithelial cells, alveoles, ducts, as well as adipocytes. [125I]CYP binding shows a 2- to 3-fold increase during pregnancy. Such a result correlates with parallel increases in stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, the cytosolic progesterone receptor concentration, as well as plasma 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone levels. At parturition, a sharp decline in beta-adrenergic receptor concentration is observed, a finding concomitant with a drop in progesterone receptor levels as well as plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations. During midlactation, beta-adrenergic receptors reach their maximal levels. The presence of specific beta-adrenergic receptors functionally coupled to the adenylate cyclase system and the marked changes in receptor capacity and distribution measured during the different physiological states of the mammary gland suggest that the mammary beta-adrenergic receptors are highly sensitive to changes in the hormonal milieu and provide a mechanism for a direct catecholaminergic influence on mammary gland growth and differentiation.", 
    "26": "Changes in left ventricular mass (LVM) were measured by echocardiography in 104 mild and moderate essential hypertensives treated with only one drug for at least 12 months. They were classified into 4 groups. G1: 40 patients (p) treated with atenolol (73.6 +/- 31.8 mg daily), G2: 32 p treated with enalapril maleate (17.7 +/- 8.7 mg daily), G3: 22 p treated with nifedipine (44.0 +/- 10.8 mg daily), G4: control group, 10 mild hypertensives without medication. At the end of the treatment blood pressure (BP) fell significantly in the first 3 groups (G1: 155 +/- 19/.98 +/- 11 vs. 136 +/- 11/86 +/- 15 mm Hg, G2: 163 +/- 19/104 +/- 10 vs. 139 +/- 12/90 +/- 8 mm Hg, G3: 166 +/- 17/103 +/- 7 vs. 142 +/- 7/85 +/- 7 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), but remained unchanged in G4. Heart rate was reduced significantly only in G1. Body weight did not change (71 +/- 7 vs. 67 +/- 7, p greater than .05). Patients were subclassified according to wether they had normal (N, LVM less than 120 g/m2 in females, LVm less than 135 g/m2 in males) or increased (H) LVM. There was a significant reduction in LVM in all H subgroups (G1 163 +/- 37 vs. 131 +/- 27 g/m2, G2: 155 +/- 19 vs. 126 +/- 21 g/m2, G3: 158 +/- 2 vs. 138 +/- 38 g/m2, p less than .005). The LVM/left ventricular end-diastolic volume ratio (M/V) fell in all H subgroups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The efficacy of three antihypertensive treatments given for 3 weeks each, 2.5 mg cilazapril, a new potent long-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, 120 mg propranolol, and the combination of both, were compared in 17 patients suffering from essential hypertension. Blood pressure control (i.e. sitting diastolic blood pressure at rest less than or equal to 90 mm Hg) was achieved in about 40% of the patients by the monocomponents, the combination therapy increased the rate to 80%. An additional blood pressure-lowering effect of the combination was also observed during isometric exercise (handgrip) but not during isotonic exercise (bicycle). At rest and during isometric exercise on cilazapril alone cardiac output rose, total peripheral resistance fell, on propranolol the inverse reactions occurred. On the combination cardiac output and total peripheral resistance decreased. During isotonic exercise propranolol slightly decreased (VO2max fell, lactate concentration went up), cilazapril slightly increased aerobic capacity (VO2max went up and lactate concentration fell) and exercise tolerance. These effects were partially attenuated by the combination. The additional blood pressure-lowering effect of the combination was assumed to be due to the suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (the ACE inhibitor and the betablocker act in a synergistic way), a peripheral vasodilation, and the reduction of sympathetic tone expressed as heart rate reduction and hence a decrease in cardiac output. It is concluded that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and a betablocker seems to exert a good antihypertensive activity not only at rest but also during exercise.", 
    "28": "A randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted to compare the ability of verapamil and atenolol to induce regression of left ventricular mass in elderly hypertensive patients and the effects of regression on left ventricular filling, ejection fraction, and cardiac volumes. Forty-two individuals over 60 years of age were enrolled in the protocol. Eight of 21 patients assigned to atenolol and 18 to 21 assigned to verapamil achieved blood pressure control with single-agent therapy (p less than 0.05). The addition of chlorthalidone resulted in blood pressure control in the three remaining assigned to verapamil and in ten of the remaining patients assigned to atenolol. In the verapamil group left ventricular mass index decreased from 104 +/- 5 to 85 +/- 5 g/M2, while it was unchanged in the atenolol patients (109 +/- 9 to 112 +/- 10 g/M2). In the patients in whom the left ventricular mass regressed, the peak filling rate increased from 2.42 +/- 0.2 to 3.31 +/- 0.4 EDV/s, while it did not change in the patients who did not experience regression. Furthermore, ejection fraction and cardiac output were maintained in patients who had regression, both at rest and during mild upright bicycle exercise.", 
    "29": "Doxazosin (mean dose 11 mg) given once daily in combination with 100 mg atenolol (n = 44) was compared with placebo and atenolol (n = 43) in a double-blind, multicenter study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In the atenolol/doxazosin-treated group, standing blood pressure significantly decreased by 17.0/12.3 mm Hg compared to 6.2/6.7 mm Hg in the atenolol/placebo group whereas supine blood pressure decreased by 13.2/9.8 mm Hg and 9.2/6.0 mm Hg, respectively in the two groups. Serum lipids did not change significantly in either group. The majority of side-effects reported were mild and transient. This study confirms that doxazosin may be safely combined with a beta-blocker. Doxazosin proved to be well tolerated and effective in patients with blood pressure refractory to atenolol alone.", 
    "30": "Wistar rats were trained in step-down inhibitory avoidance and tested 24 h later. One h prior to testing they were exposed to an open field or to an open field with flashing light (OFL) for 2 min. The OFL-exposed group showed retrieval enhancement for the avoidance task. This effect was mimicked by an injection of beta-endorphin (2.0 micrograms/kg) 1 h prior to testing, and both effects were blocked by the concomitant administration of naloxone (0.8 mg/kg, ip). Propranolol (2.0 mg/kg, ip) and atropine (0.5 mg/kg, ip) injected 6 min before the test completely blocked the retrieval-enhancing effect of both beta-endorphin and OFL. These results suggest that: 1) in rats, novel experiences may induce retrieval enhancement provided they are alerting; 2) the retrieval-enhancing effect of pre-testing exposure to OFL is probably due to activation of the brain beta-endorphin system which triggers late beta-noradrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms acting at the moment of retrieval.", 
    "31": "The haemodynamic response achieved by isradipine (Lomir) is balanced; there is a marked decrease in total peripheral resistance with no clinically significant tachycardia or cardiodepressant effect, no fluid retention (a natriuretic/diuretic effect is seen) or orthostatic reactions, whereas the blood flow to vital organs is preserved. Isradipine is highly efficacious in monotherapy and has shown greater or equal efficacy compared to other first line antihypertensive drugs, without an increase in adverse effects. Combination therapy with a beta-blocker or an ACE-inhibitor is safe and offers a useful additional reduction in blood pressure. Isradipine's antiatherogenic properties, cardioprotection, and capacity to reduce cerebral infarct size require further evaluation in clinical studies but add an interesting aspect to the drug. Against this background, isradipine appears to be a useful contribution to our therapeutic arsenal and has the potential to become the drug of choice in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "32": "Results of a three-year antihypertensive combined treatment of 24 male patients with essential hypertension aged 35-55 years are presented. In all patients the blood serum kynurenine level after tryptophan load was determined before treatment and after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd years of therapy. It was found that in a part of patients the long-term administration of antihypertensive drugs led to an increased accumulation of kynurenine as a manifestation of pyridoxal-5-phosphate deficiency. The development and preservation of an increased blood kynurenine level interferes with the positive effects of antihypertensive therapy as regards both blood pressure and left ventricular myocardial mass reduction.", 
    "33": "Behavioral syndromes mediated by serotonergic mechanisms may reflect interactions between distinct effects initiated by specific 5-HT receptors, such as the 5-HT1A and the 5-HT2 receptor. This hypothesis was tested by examining the effect of various 5-HT1A agonists on the 5-HT2 receptor-mediated quipazine-induced head shake response in rats. Subcutaneous administration of 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, gepirone, and ipsapirone produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the ketanserin-sensitive quipazine-induced head shake response. These effects were produced by doses of agonists which did not induce reciprocal forepaw treading. Furthermore, pretreatment with a partial 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)pindolol blocked the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT to the level of inhibition produced by (+/-)pindolol itself. These results suggest that stimulation of central 5-HT1A receptors can modulate the expression of a central 5-HT2 receptor-mediated behavior.", 
    "34": "Direct injection of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) into the dorsal raph\u00e9 nucleus (DRN) dose dependently increased food intake in free feeding rats. The hypothesis that this effect is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors was tested by investigating the abilities of the putative 5-HT1A antagonists metergoline, propranolol and spiperone to prevent 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating. Metergoline failed to affect 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating when injected either peripherally or into the DRN. Peripherally injected propranolol and spiperone prevented 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating, but these drugs were ineffective when injected into the DRN. These results indicate that 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating may not involve 5-HT1A receptors within the DRN. The ability of peripherally injected spiperone to prevent the eating response to 8-OH-DPAT reflects its dopamine blocking activity since haloperidol was an effective antagonist of 8-OH-DPAT-eating. This result may indicate that 8-OH-DPAT produces a general behavioural activation by reducing the inhibitory influence which 5-HT normally exerts over the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway, and that this behavioural activation is expressed as eating when food is the most salient goal object present.", 
    "35": "To determine the neurosecretory activity of hypothalamic beta-endorphin (beta EP)-containing neurons, rat fetal hypothalamic cells were mechanically dispersed and maintained in primary cultures for periods up to 24 days; their electrophysiological properties and regulation by depolarization, calcium and sodium channel-active agents were studied. Under culture conditions, the majority of the cells were immunopositive to neurofilament antibody, and a significant number (7-10%) were reactive to beta EP antibody. Cultured cells were often electrically excitable and possessed voltage-activated ionic conductances. In culture, there was a progressive increase in immunoreactive beta EP (IR-beta EP) in both cells and media, reaching maximum values at 12-16 days. The majority of IR-beta EP in both cells and media corresponded to [125I]beta EP on gel chromatography and was similar to the form previously found in the hypothalamus. These findings suggest viability of the beta EP neurons and continuing synthesis of IR-beta EP during the culture period. To evaluate the influence of membrane depolarization on IR-beta EP release, the cells were challenged with 56 mM potassium. This treatment induced a significant increase in medium IR-beta EP. The depolarization-induced IR-beta EP release was dependent upon calcium, since a calcium channel blocker, verapamil (0.1 microM), prevented the release; also a calcium ionophore, A23187 (1 microM), stimulated IR-beta EP release in the cultures. Activation of the sodium channel by veratridine (100 microM) also increased the medium content of IR-beta EP, and this effect was blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). These results suggest that the beta EP neurons in primary culture respond to the well defined physiological challenges and that the culture system can be used in determining the regulation of hypothalamic beta EP activity.", 
    "36": "To evaluate the relative influence of the two branches of the autonomic nervous system on the 4-s exercise test which measures heart rate acceleration at the onset of exercise, 6 healthy male subjects performed the 4-s test under sympathetic blockade with propranolol, parasympathetic blockade with atropine and dual blockade. The magnitude of the 4-s test results (means +/- SD) was significantly different only between the conditions with and without atropine (1.04 +/- 0.03 vs 1.53 +/- 0.33, respectively), with no differences between the control (1.60 +/- 0.25) and the test under sympathetic blockade (1.51 +/- 0.33). These results support the conclusion that the 4-s exercise test is a specific method for the evaluation of parasympathetic activity.", 
    "37": "Eighty patients (randomly assigned in 51 cases) with diverse diagnoses, were prescribed propranolol or carbamazepine for temper outbursts. Results suggested that both medications were beneficial. The diagnosis of attention deficit disorder predicted preferential response to propranolol, and a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder predicted preferential response to carbamazepine. Results, however, were not entirely consistent and require confirmation.", 
    "38": "The myocardial effects of a daily oral dose of atenolol were studied by radionuclide multi-triggered ventriculogram in 10 patients (7 men and 3 women) with mild to moderate essential hypertension, aged 29 to 53 years (mean 43) at rest and during exercise. Before and after two months of treatment with 100 mg/day orally of atenolol, the following variables were recorded: systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), ejection fraction (EF), peak filling rate (PFR) and peak ejection rate (PER). Beta-blockade treatment caused a significant drop in SBP and DBP, both at rest and during exercise; HR slowed down at rest and during exercise. PFR diminished at rest and during exercise. PER was reduced at rest and during exercise (p less than 0.001). No significant changes in EF were observed after treatment with atenolol. In conclusion, atenolol impaired left ventricular relaxation in spite of the drop in blood pressure.", 
    "39": "The effect of nifedipine (NIF) was studied in intact conscious dogs with and without autonomic blockade. Maximal decrease of systolic arterial pressure (delta P, in mmHg), maximal increase of heart rate (delta F, in beats/min), the ratio delta F/delta P, and the time elapsed between delta F and delta P (delta t) were measured after the acute administration of the drug. Two intravenous doses of NIF (50 and 150 micrograms/kg) were administered either alone or after sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade. Group Ia: 50 micrograms/kg of NIF alone. The delta F/delta P and delta T were 3.8 +/- 0.4 and 11.3 +/- 2.2 sec respectively. Group Ib: 150 micrograms/kg of NIF alone. The delta F/delta P and delta T were 2.4 +/- 0.2 and 15 +/- 3 sec respectively. Group IIa: 2 mg/kg of propranolol + 150 micrograms/kg of NIF. The delta F/delta P and delta T were 0.84 +/- 0.4 and 16 +/- 5 sec respectively. Group IIIa: 0.2 mg/kg of atropine + 2 mg/kg of propranolol + 50 micrograms/kg of NIF. In this group left systolic ventricular pressure decreased about 14 mmHg, but the heart rate (HR) was not modified. Group IIIb: 0.2 mg/kg of atropine + 2 mg/kg of propranolol + 150 micrograms/kg of NIF. In this group, left systolic ventricular pressure decreased about 18 mmHg but the HR was not modified. We conclude that acute administration of NIF decreases systolic ventricular pressure and increases HR. The reflex tachycardia is partially abolished by 2 mg/kg of propranolol, and completely abolished by sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "The TIMI Trials consist of three primary studies plus numerous ancillary observations. TIMI I was the direct reperfusion comparison between streptokinase and TPA. The central observations were: Higher reperfusion rates with TPA; Equivalent frequencies of bleeding complications; No differences in clinical outcome parameters; Only early reperfusion produced LV function improvement. TIMI IIA compared routine post-IV lytic therapy (TPA) immediate PTCA with a delayed interventional approach at 18-48 hours post lysis. The study demonstrated: Equivalent outcome LV function; Equivalent mortality rates; More emergency CABG in the \"immediate\" group; More hemorrhagic complications in the immediate group. TIMI IIB compared delayed but routine interventional post-lytic care (PTCA) with a more conservative strategy. Additionally patients were secondarily randomized to acute administration of IV beta blocker (metoprolol) or delayed administration of beta blocker, starting on Day 6. The primary results of this investigation include: A very low early (2 week) mortality rate with either strategy (about 5%); preserved low mortality at the one year follow up for both groups; no difference (routine intervention versus conservative strategy) in outcome LV function; no difference in comparative mortality rates; less recurrent ischemia in the routine PTCA group; 13% need for PTCA in the conservative group; no difference in LV function based upon beta blockade assignment but some decrease in mortality in acute beta blockade subgroups.", 
    "41": "Beta-adrenergic blockers have been reported to depress central ventilatory drive. The authors investigated this possibility in a double-blind, randomized fashion in 12 healthy volunteers who received 0.1 mg.kg-1 of propranolol and normal saline intravenously at two separate study sessions. A modified Read rebreathing technique was used. Both ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to CO2 were measured to help separate peripheral (airway) from central mechanisms. Significant beta blockade was demonstrated by statistically lower heart rate responses to CO2 rebreathing after propranolol, but not normal saline. Nevertheless, propranolol exerted no significant effect on resting end-tidal CO2 or the ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to CO2. Although health subjects appear to have minimal alterations in their ventilatory response to CO2 after beta-adrenergic blockade, patients with airway disease may still experience significant changes in ventilation. In addition, drug interaction studies may give further insight into the presence or absence of any respiratory effects of propranolol.", 
    "42": "The clinical response to felodipine, in addition to a beta-blocker, was evaluated and compared with placebo in this double-blind cross-over study. Twenty patients with exertional angina pectoris completed the study. Felodipine reduced the number of angina attacks and the Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN) consumption. The median exercise capacity was increased 33% after 4 weeks' felodipine treatment compared with placebo. At maximal exercise, systolic blood pressure and rate pressure product were reduced by felodipine while no change was seen in heart rate or ST-depression. Felodipine reduced both supine and erect blood pressure. The mean supine blood pressure at rest was 138/82 mm Hg after four weeks' placebo treatment compared with 114/71 mmHg after felodipine 5-10 mg b.i.d. Felodipine has overall a modest but significant anti-anginal benefit when combined with a beta-blocker.", 
    "43": "The mechanisms by which imipramine and dihydroergosine stimulate the 5-HT syndrome in rats and inhibit the head-twitch response in rats and mice were studied. Imipramine- and dihydroergosine-induced stimulation of the 5-HT syndrome was inhibited stereoselectively by propranolol, a high affinity ligand for 5-HT1 receptor sites, but not by ritanserin, a specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. (-)-Propranolol potentiated the inhibitory effect of imipramine, but not of dihydroergosine on the head-twitch response, while ritanserin was without effect. Neither imipramine nor dihydroergosine were able to stimulate the 5-HT syndrome in the animals pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine. As expected, 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, stimulated, and 5-HT1B agonists CGS 12066B and 1-(trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) failed to stimulate the 5-HT syndrome induced in rats by pargyline and 5-HTP administration. A higher dose of ritanserin inhibited the syndrome. While 8-OH-DPAT alone produced all behavioral components of the 5-HT syndrome, dihydroergosine or imipramine alone even at very high doses never produced tremor or a more intensive forepaw padding as seen when these drugs were given in combination with pargyline and 5-HTP. A single administration of (-)-propranolol also inhibited the head-twitch response. This effect lasted in mice longer than after ritanserin administration. In in vitro experiments dihydroergosine expressed approximately twenty-fold higher affinity for 3H-ketanserin binding sites than imipramine. The results suggest that imipramine and dihydroergosine possess two components--one stimulating the 5-HT syndrome in rats by a presynaptic, presumably 5-HT1A-mediated mechanism, and the other inhibiting 5-HT2 binding sites.", 
    "44": "Pharmacologic therapy designed to block adrenergic activity or alter hormonal milieu may modulate energy and protein metabolism in stress. The metabolic effects of propranolol (beta adrenergic receptor blocker) in sepsis was investigated in 22 well-nourished rats that underwent superior vena caval cannulation, cecal ligation, and puncture. Animals were randomly assigned to receive either a continuous infusion of 0.7 mg/day of propranolol combined with parenteral nutrition (n = 11) or parenteral nutrition alone (n = 11). Both groups received isocaloric, isonitrogenous, isovolemic, parenteral nutrition post-operatively for 24 hr. Nitrogen balance was better for the propranolol group than for the control group (+743 +/- 84 mg/kg/day versus +300 +/- 63 mg/kg/day, respectively, P less than 0.05). A significant difference between the pharmacologic therapy and control groups was noted for urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion versus control (0.99 +/- 0.08 micrograms/kg/day versus 7.5 +/- 0.37 micrograms/kg/day, respectively, P less than 0.01). Measured energy expenditure was similar for both pharmacologic therapy and control groups (149 +/- 20 kcal/kg/day versus 134 +/- 11 kcal/kg/day, respectively, P = N.S.). No statistically significant difference was demonstrated for 24-hr survival between propranolol and control groups (73 and 64%, respectively). Continuous, low-dose propranolol promotes nitrogen retention and decreases 3-methylhistidine excretion without altering energy expenditure in parenterally fed septic rats.", 
    "45": "The effect of the selective beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent atenolol (50 or 100 mg, orally) on spontaneous and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-stimulated GH release was evaluated in six GH-deficient children during long term therapy with GHRH. Nocturnal GH concentrations were determined every 20 min for 12 h under the following four conditions: 1) control, 2) atenolol administration only, 3) sc GHRH administration only, and 4) combined GHRH and atenolol administration. The mean 12-h nocturnal GH concentrations after administration of atenolol alone [2.4 +/- 0.6 microgram/L (mean +/- SEM)] or GHRH alone (2.7 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L) were indistinguishable from baseline values (2.0 +/- 0.5 microgram/L; P greater than 0.05). In contrast, the addition of atenolol to ongoing GHRH therapy caused a clear augmentation of 12-h overnight GH release compared to that during all other study periods (5.0 +/- 1.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). In a subset of three subjects for whom GH pulse characteristics were determined, the primary mode of the enhanced GH release was through an increase in the amplitude of serum GH pulses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic blocking compounds enhance the responsivity of the pituitary gland to agents that permit GH release by inhibiting hypothalamic somatostatin secretion or action. They suggest that atenolol may have potential as an adjunctive therapy in some children with abnormalities of GH secretion when GHRH is the primary therapeutic agent.", 
    "46": "Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are not only immunoregulatory polypeptides, but may have endocrine functions. We have studied the direct effects of recombinant and purified TNF and IL-1 on renin secretion using both static incubations and perifusions of rat renal cortical slices. Ultrapure human IL-1 (hIL-1) at concentrations as low as 5 U/ml (3 X 10(-12) M) significantly stimulated renin secretion (control, 98 +/- 4%; hIL-1, 153 +/- 13%; P less than 0.01). TNF similarly induced renin release [control, 97 +/- 6%; TNF (10 U/ml), 151 +/- 13%; P less than 0.005]. TNF and recombinant human IL-1 beta (rhIL-i beta) also blocked the inhibitory actions of angiotensin-II (AII) on renin release [control, 100 +/- 3%; AII (2 X 10(-7) M), 80 +/- 5%; AII plus TNF (20 U/ml), 102 +/- 7%; AII plus rhIL beta (10 U/ml), 106 +/- 6%; both P less than 0.02 vs. AII]. A cyclooxygenase (CO) blocker, meclofenamate (M), which does not significantly alter basal renin release, attenuated the TNF- and rhIL-1 beta-induced renin secretion [TNF (20 U/ml), 132 +/- 11%; TNF plus M (5 X 10(-5) M), 100 +/- 3% (P less than 0.01); rhIL-1 beta (10 U/ml), 135 +/- 9%; rhIL-1 beta plus M, 105 +/- 10% (P less than 0.05)]. The stimulatory effects of TNF and IL-1 on renin were reversible. These results suggest that IL-1 and TNF are renin secretagogues and can also block the inhibitory actions of AII on renin. Since the effect of TNF and IL-1 on renin can be blocked by a (CO) inhibitor, the studies indicate a role of prostaglandins in their action. Therefore, locally produced TNF and IL-1 may play an important paracrine role in regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "47": "Second-order derivative UV spectroscopy was used to measure the transfer of befunolol-HCl across full-thickness rabbit skin in vitro. The effect of penetration enhancers, azone-PG and PEG-400, on permeation course of befunolol-HCl was studied. A type of horizontal diffusion cell was employed. Permeability coefficients were measured in normal saline and in solutions containing the enhancing agents. The results indicated that befunolol-HCl may be an interesting candidate for transdermal administration and azone-PG highly and significantly increases the skin permeation of the drug in the solvent system tested.", 
    "48": "The corneal endothelium was examined in ten patients suffering from ocular hypertension before, during and after four months of topical levobunolol treatment. The untreated fellow eye served as a control. The number of endothelial cells, determined with a McIntyre eyepiece and an Eisner's contact lens, was not affected by levobunolol therapy. In addition, the morphology of the cell did not appear to be affected by the drug.", 
    "49": "Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol are capable of inducing catalepsy in rodents. Non-selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonists such as methysergide reduce the cataleptic effect of haloperidol. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of 5-HT-1A receptors in chlorpromazine-induced catalepsy in mice. Pindolol and buspirone, two putative 5-HT-1A receptor ligands, were used. Pretreatment with these drugs reduced the cataleptic effect of chlorpromazine. Clomipramine, a 5-HT neuronal uptake blocker, reversed the inhibitory effect of buspirone. Pretreatment with clomipramine alone caused a potentiation of neuroleptic-induced catalepsy. These results suggest that central 5-HT-1A receptors play an important role in neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in mice.", 
    "50": "In a previous study we have shown that microinjection of d,1-propranolol into the dorsal midbrain central gray of the rat causes an anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze model which is likely to be mediated by endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine. In the present experiment, the effects of 1- and d,1-propranolol were compared under the same experimental conditions. Both the 1-isomer and the racemic mixture increased the percentage of open arm entries without affecting the total number of entries into either open or enclosed arms of the maze, thus reproducing the selective anxiolytic effect previously described. The doses of 5 nmol 1-propranolol and 10 nmol d,1-propranolol caused anxiolytic effects of comparable magnitude, while the doses of 2.5 nmol of the former and 5 nmol of the latter were ineffective. Therefore, the 1-isomer was nearly twice as potent as the racemic mixture, thus being responsible for the pharmacological activity observed. These results are compatible with the proposal that propranol blocks stereospecific autoreceptors in serotonergic nerve endings that inhibit neurotransmitter release.", 
    "51": "Sixty-three rats with previous training in a T-maze, bilaterally implanted with cannulae directed toward the dorsal hippocampus, were used in this study. All rats received bilateral 1-microliter injections 20 min before testing for locomotor activity (day 1) and one-way active avoidance (day 3). The following drugs were injected into groups of 4 to 8 animals: scopolamine (9 or 18 micrograms/microliters), propranolol (5 or 10 micrograms/microliters), cimetidine (0.75 or 1.5 micrograms/microliters), sulpiride (5 or 10 micrograms/microliters), or vehicle (Krebs-Ringer). Locomotor activity was not changed by injection of any drug. However, intrahippocampal injections of scopolamine (9 micrograms/microliters) and sulpiride (10 micrograms/microliters) impaired avoidance behavior, particularly during the last five trials of the task. We conclude that muscarinic-cholinergic and D2-dopaminergic, but not beta-adrenergic or H2-histaminergic, mechanisms in the hippocampus are involved in the performance of one-way active avoidance behavior.", 
    "52": "Comparison of the decrease in intraocular tension in a group of 25 patients show that the collyria of oxprenolol, 0.25%, led to an average decrease of 6.36 mmHg, whereas that of thymolol maleate, 0.25%, to a decrease of 8.76 mmHg. Both decreases were statistically significant versus the initial intraocular tension.", 
    "53": "It has been established that penbutolol reacts with iron(III) chloride in the presence of ammonium thiocyanate to form a pink complex (2:1) that is soluble in chloroform with a maximum absorbance at 478 nm. By application of the methods of Sommer and Job involving non-equimolar solutions, the conditional stability constant (log k') of the complex at the optimum pH of 1.5 +/- 0.02 and an ionic strength of (mu) 0.14 M, was found to be 5.769. The molar absorptivity at 478 nm was 136 1 mol-1 cm-1 at pH 1.5 +/- 0.02. The validity of Beer's law has been tested in the concentration range 3-18 x 10(-4) M; the relative standard deviation (n = 8) was 1.52-3.21%. The proposed method was found to be suitable for the accurate, simple and rapid analysis of penbutolol in the bulk drug and in tablets.", 
    "54": "Safety deals with the surveillance and detection of possible threats that can arise against a patient. It might not be an obvious one, like an anaphylactic shock, but a bizarre syndrome of late onset preceded by vague signs or symptoms. To be able to conclude about a possible causal relationship between a drug and such a state with as short a delay in time as possible, the collection and analysis of adverse events during the total clinical trial program of a drug is mandatory. To ask investigators for adverse drug reactions instead is to produce an effective filter, which may help in keeping the incidence figures down in the international data sheet but which also may prove to be hazardous for the pharmaceutical industry in the long run.", 
    "55": "A review of the literature concerning quality of life aspects on ACE-inhibitors in hypertensive patients is given. In the first part of the eighties two prospective multi-center randomised trials were conducted to determine the effect of captopril in comparison to methyldopa or an unselective beta-blocker on the quality of life in patients with mild to moderate hypertension (Hill et al. and Croog et al.). Both studies revealed slight but significant positive effects on indices of quality of life in captopril treated patients compared to those who had methyldopa or an unselective beta-blocker. Later, another ACE-inhibitor, enalapril, has been compared with a selective beta-blocker (Edmonds et al. and Herrick et al.) with respect to side-effects and the quality of life. The measurements of the quality of life tended to favour enalapril, but the differences were small and the over-all tolerability of the two drugs was similar. In conclusion, comparisons with more long standing forms of antihypertensive therapy suggest a slightly more favourable effect of ACE-inhibitors on the quality of life.", 
    "56": "Diuretic drugs seem to be well tolerated during long-term antihypertensive treatment. Although they induce severe side effects necessitating withdrawal more often than placebo, the frequency of such withdrawals seem to be equal to that induced by beta-blocker treatment. The subjective tolerability as judged by questionnaires for symptoms and well being scores seems to indicate an over-all small improvement in patient well being. The effects in this respect seem to be similar to those exerted by a selective beta-blocker.",

The solution is heated at 90 degrees C and the absorbance is measured at 750 nm at a fixed time of 30 min. The concentration (c) of sotalol is calculated from the absorbance (A) by the equation: A = 0.04 + 0.0015625 c.", 
    "58": "A clinical study of the lens transparency conditions was made on 118 patients with regard for an applicable treatment, the use of hyperbaric oxygenation and a type of lesion. It showed, that sutures of the lens were wider in patients with uveitis and in diabetic patients as compared with the control-group patients who had no other pathologies. Glaucomatous patients had very narrow sutures. Initial opacifications of the lens were perceived in patients with uveitis and in diabetic patients as stars oriented along sutures beneath the posterior capsule in the area of the nucleus. Following hyperbaric oxygenation and equally the corticosteroid therapy, there was a decrease in the thickness of the sutures, and the degree of transparency of the lenticular nucleus changed as well mainly in the zone bordering on the posterior cortex strata. The study underlines the importance of examination of the condition of the lens sutures in determining the toxic impact produced by different factors on the lens.",

    "60": "The effects of a single 20 mg oral dose of timolol, a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist which is subject to hydroxylation in the liver, on intraocular pressure and heart rate were compared in four poor and five extensive debrisoquine metabolizers, using non-contact tonometry and bicycle ergometry. The beta blockade of timolol on exercise heart rate was significantly higher in poor than in extensive metabolisers with no significant difference on resting heart rate or intraocular pressure.", 
    "61": "The osmotic stress to rats of replacing drinking water with 2% NaCl for four days (salt loading) led to dramatic ultrastructural morphological changes in the neural lobe of the pituitary, including a decrease in the ratio of glial to neurosecretory terminal coverage of the pericapillary basal lamina. The decrease in the proportion of the basal lamina covered by pituicytes, the specialized astrocytic glial cells of the neural lobe, was due to a decrease in the number of pituicyte processes reaching the pericapillary spaces. The concomitant increase in the proportion of neuronal coverage was due to the combination of an increase in the length of individual nerve terminals and a change in the number of terminals. Similar structural changes to those seen in vivo were produced by incubation of the isolated neural lobe with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoprenaline. A decrease in the ratio of glial to neuronal coverage of the basal lamina was achieved within 1 h and could be blocked by inclusion of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol. It is proposed that the morphological plasticity is explained by the active movement of pituicyte cytoplasm.", 
    "62": "Residual glaucoma after an iridectomy in primary angle-closure glaucoma, or so called post-iridectomy glaucoma, is rather well recognized recently. It is also realized that probably different mechanisms in addition to the pupillary block mechanism co-exist in the same glaucoma eye. The efficacy of medical treatment for such glaucoma was evaluated by dark prone provocative test after timolol or pilocarpine topical instillation to compare with non-medication as control in 72 iridectomized eyes. The results revealed pilocarpine medication has only six eyes positive (8.3%) and significantly prevents IOP elevation in the test while timolol has no significant effect (23 eyes positive, 31.9%) when both were compared with the control study (31 eyes positive, 43.1%). The results may also suggest additional different mechanisms involved in this glaucoma.", 
    "63": "40 patients with MVP (mean age 36 years--group I) and 20 controls without any heart disease (mean age 40 years--group II) after thorough clinical examination (including Holter monitoring) were subjected to electrophysiological study for sinoatrial node function assessment. The following parameters were studied (before and after \"pharmacological denervation\"):, SNRT, CSNRT, SP and SACT (using direct method and Strauss and Narul's method). SN dysfunction was found in 19 patients with MVP (37.5%) and in 3 controls (15%) in 24-hour Holter ecg. In the electrophysiological study SN dysfunction was diagnosed in 13 patients (32.5%) of group I. 10 of them displayed also electrocardiographic symptoms of SN dysfunction. \"Pharmacological denervation\" of the heart (propranolol 0.1 mg/kg, atropine 0.02 mg/kg) revealed 4 cases of concealed SN dysfunction defining the functional background of abnormalities in 7 out of 13 patients. Our data show that SN dysfunction is common in patients with MVP. Electrophysiological study performed with \"pharmacological denervation\" may disclose cases of concealed SN dysfunction and define them as functional or organic.", 
    "64": "This study was performed to assess the effect of a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) and beta-blockade (atenolol) on left ventricular early diastolic function and filling in essential hypertension (WHO stage I, II; HT). Twenty-two untreated patients were randomly divided as nifedipine (11 patients) and atenolol (11 patients) treatment groups and both the groups had complete echocardiographic and Doppler studies. Twenty normotensive cases served as controls. Clinical and echo-Doppler data obtained at baseline and four weeks after initiation of each therapy showed no difference between the two HT groups as to mean blood pressure (before therapy, 119 +/- 3 vs 117 +/- 11 mmHg; after therapy, 106 +/- 3 vs 110 +/- 3 mmHg), left ventricular dimension, left atrial dimension, and wall thickness. To evaluate early diastolic function, the interval from the aortic closure sound (IIA, phonocardiography) to the opening of the mitral valve (MVO, echocardiography) and that from MVO to the O point of the apexcardiogram were measured. The IIA-O interval was also calculated. The peak velocities in the rapid filling (R) and atrial contraction phases (A) were measured using pulsed Doppler echocardiography at the center of the mitral orifice. The MVO-O/IIA-MVO and A/R ratios were also calculated. Compared with the controls, the IIA-O interval (143.9 +/- 6.8 msec) and the IIA-MVO interval (81.5 +/- 4.9 msec) were significantly prolonged in HT (p less than 0.01). There was no significant difference between the MVO-O interval and R. Velocity A (54.2 +/- 2.7 cm/sec) and the A/R ratio (1.01 +/- 0.11) increased significantly in HT (p less than 0.05). The IIA-O interval (before therapy, 153.3 +/- 7.6 vs after therapy, 134.3 +/- 6.2 msec) and IIA-MVO interval (87.3 +/- 6.3 vs 77.8 +/- 5.9 msec) decreased and R (43.7 +/- 3.8 vs 49.1 +/- 3.0 cm/sec) increased significantly with nifedipine. The IIA-O interval (135.7 +/- 11.3 vs 150.4 +/- 7.6 msec) and the MVO-O (58.4 +/- 3.9 vs 66.5 +/- 4.7 msec) interval were significantly prolonged with atenolol, however the IIA-MVO interval, R, and A/R did not change. A (57.5 +/- 4.0 vs 50.2 +/- 2.9 cm/sec) was also significantly decreased with atenolol. There was a significant correlation between reduction in velocity A and prolongation in the MVO-O interval (r = -0.62, p less than 0.05) with atenolol. These results suggested that the prolongation of the diastolic closure rate of the mitral valve by atenolol was related to increased ventricular filling and decreased atrial contraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Two cases of dilated cardiomyopathy with incessant supraventricular tachycardia were treated with beta-blockade. Propranolol at a dose of 30 mg per day in combination with diuretics and digitalis decreased atrial rate of tachycardia and the cardiac size in both cases. The careful administration of beta-blockade seems to be one of the choices for the treatment for atrial tachycardia associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "66": "To investigate the mechanism of lidocaine's effect to cause vasorelaxation, swine epicardial mid-right coronary arterial rings were placed under constant (5 g) tension in a muscle bath, precontracted with 35 mmol/l KCl and exposed to increasing concentrations of lidocaine (3-2,000 micrograms/ml). At a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, mild vasoconstriction occurred, increasing tension 1.9 +/- 0.1% above baseline. Vasodilation began to occur at 30 micrograms/ml and was maximal at 2,000 micrograms/ml, reducing tension 97.5 +/- 0.2% below baseline. Vasodilation was not altered significantly by removal of endothelium or by pretreatment with propranolol or indometacin.", 
    "67": "The effect of obsidan (propranolol) on the physical load tolerance was examined in 65 hypertensive patients up to 55 years of age treated for one year in outpatient conditions. The patients were classified into two groups: basic group of 45 patients with hypertension in initial II stage and a control group of 22 hypertensive patients. The basic group patients were treated in the course of one year with obsidan in doses of 80 up to 160 mg daily. The control group patients were treated irregularly with other hypotensive drugs. The dynamic indices were examined in rest and after physical load before and after treatment. The long-term treatment with obsidan led to an improvement of the general condition, effective lowering of the arterial pressure in rest and after physical load, increased tolerance to physical load, decreased double product.", 
    "68": "The influence of beta-blockers in short- and long-term application on the epithelium of the cornea was studied in rabbits with intact tear film, concentrating not on the completeness of the drug group but on general differences. The new unpreserved beta-blocker timolol was compared on an exemplary level with the following beta-blocker formulas: (1) beta-blocker eye drops with 0.01% of the preservative benzalkonium chloride; (2) beta-blocker eye drops with 0.005% of the preservative benzalkonium chloride, and (3) beta-blocker eye drops with 0.004% of the preservative benzalkonium chloride and the tear substitute polyvinyl alcohol. Exposure time in the short-term test was 30 min, in long-term tests the time was 24 weeks. Any cell damages observed were of only minor importance and rarely of clinical relevance; however, it could be shown that micromorphological cell reactions differed as a function of the preservative concentration. Complete absence of preservatives causes no difference in micromorphologically relevant changes in comparison with the control group. Drugs without preservatives are thus a meaningful alternative for patients with allergies, sensitive eyes or existing impairment of the precorneal film.", 
    "69": "The multiplicity of theories regarding the aetiology of myopia has led to numerous and partly contradictory methods of therapy. Interest has been focused on accommodation because of the established association between myopia and close work. In studies of drug treatment of myopia, the treatment is often reported to be effective but the lack of randomization and high drop-out rates make the results questionable. In the Soviet Union, scleral reinforcement is said to be highly successful. Bifocal spectacle lenses reduce the accommodative demand, but studies on the effect of bifocal lenses have shown widely varying results. Whether contact lenses are effective in the control of myopia is still uncertain. In a Danish prospective study on the effect of treatment with bifocal lenses and beta-blocker eye drops a lower rate of progression was found among children wearing bifocal lenses but the difference from the control group was too small to warrant the use of such lenses in every myopic child. The progression rate in the group treated with the beta-blocker timolol maleate was not different from that in the control group. There thus seems to be no simple way of stopping or reducing the progression of myopia. Epidemiological data indicate that the maximum incidences of myopia are associated with educational systems in which the demands on the ability of the child to learn are stringent. One might introduce the term 'ocular stress' but this is clearly difficult to define and even more difficult to measure.", 
    "70": "The effects of a single dose and of prolonged administration of glucocorticoids and of a single dose of salbutamol, theophylline or propranolol on the rate of ethanol elimination and blood acetate concentration were examined in healthy male students. Mean ethanol elimination rate and mean blood acetate concentration were increased significantly after acute intake of glucocorticoids. After chronic administration of glucocorticoids, the rate of ethanol elimination was significantly increased, whereas blood acetate concentration showed a tendency to increase, but did not reach statistical significance. Changes were found neither in ethanol elimination rates nor in blood acetate levels after single doses of salbutamol, theophylline and propranolol.", 
    "71": "There is circumstantial evidence that increases in prolactin secretion evoked by L-tryptophan infusion involve 5-HT1 receptors, whereas growth hormone responses do not. Propranolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist that also possesses antagonist properties at 5-HT1 receptors. Propranolol (80 mg, PO) failed to attenuate the prolactin response to L-tryptophan infusion (100 mg/kg, IV) in seven volunteers; the role of 5-HT1 receptors in this response remains uncertain. The growth hormone response to tryptophan was enhanced by propranolol, consistent with previous reports of an inhibitory beta-adrenoceptor influence on GH secretion. Excessive beta-adrenoceptor function might explain the blunted growth hormone response to tryptophan in depression.",

Clinical features, laboratory investigations are reported. Ten patients had a surgical treatment:subtotal thyroidectomy. A review of literature in Africa was made. Whereas thyrotoxicosis was rare among Africans before 1970, there has been an increase of frequency for twenty years. Many hypotheses are proposed, among them the possibility of the role of Epstein-Barr's virus, frequent in Africa.", 
    "73": "Impedance plethysmography was used to examine 38 patients (27 men and 11 women) with stage II essential hypertension according to the WHO classification. The patients' age ranged from 31 to 60 years (6.3 +/- 1.08 on the average), with the disease lasting from 1 to 16 years. It has been established that administration of propranolol at the daily dose of 120 to 160 mg for 10 to 12 days produces a varying effect on the cardiac output (CO) and peripheral blood supply depending on their initial magnitudes. In the majority of patients with the hyper- and eukinetic versions, the CO and peripheral blood supply decrease in all the areas examined (in the abdominal cavity, leg, finger and head) whereas in patients with the hypokinetic version, they rise. The relatively normal regional blood supply drops whereas in the majority of patients it increases provided it was at a lower level before. Blood redistribution ameliorates the blood supply to the areas marked by a low initial level but makes it worse in the areas with a relatively normal magnitude. The peripheral blood supply gets deteriorated in the majority of patients. In contract to the arterial blood supply, the specific blood volume that primarily characterizes the amount of the venous blood in the given area undergoes redistribution in the peripheral areas in the majority of propranolol-treated patients with all the types of hemodynamics. The pattern of its alterations in the chest and, in the majority of patients, in the abdominal cavity is always related to the initial level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "A total of 56 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), angina pectoris of effort, functional classes II-III, were placed under observation. All the patients received 20 mg foridon (F), 20 mg corinfar (C), 80 mg anapriline (A). 24 patients were subjected to the continuous treatment with F (20 mg 4 times a day). The antianginal action of the drug was compared to the blood concentration on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 43 and 57 of the treatment with F. In 14 patients with angina pectoris and in 18 patients with essential hypertension, the efficacy of F and C was cross correlated. It has been demonstrated that F can be successfully used for the treatment of patients with CHD, angina pectoris of effort and (or) essential hypertension. The increase of the single dose of foridon from 20 to 40 mg does not result in the potentiation of its hypotensive effect. F and C provoke the highest rise of exercise tolerance with combined angina pectoris. Continuous concomitant administration of F and C with A leads to the potentiation of the antianginal action.", 
    "75": "1H nuclear magnetic resonance at 360 MHz shows that SK&F 96365 (1-(beta-[3-(p-methoxyphenyl)-propyloxy]-p-methoxyphenethyl)-1H- imidazole hydrochloride), an antagonist of mammalian receptor-operated calcium channels, interacts with the calcium-binding regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM). This may be inferred by a number of chemical shift changes in the spectrum of the calcium-saturated protein induced by addition of the compound. Moreover, two well-resolved singlets corresponding to the 2-proton of the SK&F 96365 imidazolium moiety are observed in the spectrum over a wide range of protein:compound ratios. Separation of rac SK&F 96365 into its two enantiomers by high-performance liquid chromatography on a cellulose tris (4-methylbenzoate) column enabled us to show that the doubling of this NMR signal in the presence of CaM is due to a propensity of the protein to distinguish between the two optical isomers of the compound.", 
    "76": "Retroperitoneal fibrosis occurred in a 62-year-old man who had been treated during 4 years eye-drops containing timolol. The disease was diagnosed after a sudden episode of nephritic colic. The recovery was progressive and uneventful. No corticosteroid therapy was used. Six months later the patient remained free of symptoms. Although an idiopathic origin could not be excluded, the causal relationship with timolol treatment is likely due to the chronology of events and the lack of other causes.", 
    "77": "The effects of the novel antihypertensive agent, carvedilol, on renal hemodynamics and excretory function have been investigated and compared with the effects of labetalol in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats. Sustained intravenous infusion of carvedilol or labetalol at a rate of 10 micrograms/kg/min resulted in a significant decrease in blood pressure which was equivalent in magnitude for both drugs. Carvedilol had no effect on renal hemodynamic parameters; glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow, and filtration fraction were unchanged. In contrast, labetalol decreased the glomerular filtration rate by 13% (p less than 0.01) and the filtration fraction was reduced from 28 to 24%. Inasmuch as renal blood flow was unchanged and perfusion pressure was reduced, both compounds decreased renal vascular resistance. Urine flow decreased and osmolality increased with both carvedilol and labetalol. However, excretion of electrolytes was affected differently with the two compounds. While sodium and potassium excretion were significantly decreased with labetalol, sodium and potassium excretion remained stable during carvedilol infusion, which represents an important beneficial effect for a potent systemic vasodilator. We conclude, therefore, that carvedilol does not compromise the renal autoregulatory integrity in hypertensive rats, and that the antihypertensive activity of the compound is associated with an apparent 'renal sparing' effect, in that the decrease in blood pressure does not compromise the urinary excretion of sodium.", 
    "78": "Responsiveness to inhaled histamine and DL propranolol hydrochloride was measured in 31 adult asthmatics and compared with bronchoconstriction provoked by acute oral propranolol dosing (max 160 mg). Twelve asthmatics developed greater than or equal to 15% reduction in the forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1), 2 h after less than or equal to 100 mg oral propranolol; cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was confirmed by cycle exercise tests in the 19 without airway response. The provocative inhaled dose of each aerosol causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20) was lower, histamine 0.43 mg.ml-1, propranolol 3.12 mg.ml-1, in the 12 with a positive oral test compared with the 19 with a negative test, PC20 histamine 1.65 mg.ml-1, PC20 propranolol 16.2 mg.ml-1 (P less than 0.001 for both aerosols). A correlation was demonstrated between the PC20 values for asthmatics with a negative oral test (r = 0.72, P less than 0.001, n = 19) but not for the remainder (r = 0.14, P greater than 0.05, n = 12). Plasma propranolol concentrations (CL, ng.ml-1) after the final oral dose did not correlate with the % delta FEV1 (26.3) (r = -0.28) when an airway response was provoked or with the reduction in exercise tachycardia (25.9%) (r = 0.31) when no bronchoconstriction occurred. CL exceeded the limit of detection after the final inhaled propranolol dose (7.5 ng.ml-1) and was weakly related to the PC20 propranolol value (r = 0.53, P = 0.01, n = 27).

    "79": "A double-blind, parallel-group multicentre study has been done to compare the antihypertensive properties, effects on serum lipoproteins and adverse effect profiles of diltiazem and metoprolol given as monotherapy to primary hypertensive patients. 128 patients were included from 10 participating centers. Following a placebo wash-out period of 5 weeks, patients were randomized either to diltiazem or metoprolol treatment according to a forced titration regimen. Each dose was given for a 4-week period in a stepwise regimen. A total of 119 patients, 59 and 60 in the two groups, completed the study. Supine and standing BPs were reduced in a similar, dose-dependent fashion by diltiazem and metoprolol. In the former supine BP fell from 161/101 to 151/91 mmHg at the highest dose level. In the latter patients, supine BP at the highest dose level was reduced from 161/102 to 155/94 mmHg. Target pressures (DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or DBP reduction of greater than or equal to 10%) were reached in 63% and 48% of the patients, respectively. HDL-cholesterol was increased in diltiazem-treated patients and decreased in those on metoprolol. Otherwise, serum lipoproteins did not differ significantly between treatments. The incidence and severity of dose-dependent adverse effects did not differ significantly between treatments, although moderate to distressing side effects were reported more commonly by metoprolol-treated patients. Ankle oedema and breathlessness tended to be more common on diltiazem therapy, while tiredness, increased sweating and sleep disturbances appeared to be experienced more frequently by metoprolol-treated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "The effect of submaximal exercise on the pharmacokinetics of low dose intravenous propranolol was studied in 15 healthy human subjects. There was a wide individual variation in the results for each subject and a large difference in the degree of changes with exercise. The effect of exercise on the pharmacokinetics of propranolol, a flow limited drug, is marked but variable. This phenomenon may have profound effects on patients taking the drug regularly who exercise intermittently and drug doses may have to be adjusted.", 
    "81": "The pharmacokinetics of atenolol and the effect of the drug on the clinical and laboratory features of hyperthyroidism were studied in 23 patients with hyperthyroidism. In the hyperthyroid state, the time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax) occurred significantly earlier, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the areas under the curve were also significantly less compared to the euthyroid state, but there was no significant difference in peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) between these states. Administration of atenolol once daily resulted in marked clinical improvement in 2 to 4 weeks. The clinical index of thyrotoxic symptoms and signs decreased from 23.2 +/- 10.8 to 8.4 +/- 5.3 (p less than 0.005). Pulse similarly decreased significantly from 93.9 +/- 15.7 to 77.8 +/- 10.5. In contrast to the marked clinical improvement, there was no change in any of the serum concentrations of thyroid hormones T4, free T4, T3 and free T3 at the time of maximal clinical effect compared to pretreatment values. These data show that the beneficial effect of atenolol in hyperthyroidism is not due to changes in thyroid hormone metabolism.",

    "83": "Studies were undertaken to characterize the participation of specific alpha-1,alpha-2 and beta adrenoceptors of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) in the urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. Alpha-1 and alpha-2 LHA receptors were shown to participate in the regulation of renal sodium and potassium excretion. The effects of noradrenaline microinjection (30 nmol in 1 microliter) into the LHA on urinary sodium excretion (UNaV) are blocked by previous injection of the alpha-1 antagonist prazosin (4 nmol in 1 microliter) from 3.22 +/- 0.25 to 0.59 +/- 0.04 microEq min-1 100 g body weight-1. Pre-injection of yohimbine, an alpha-2 antagonist (4 nmol in 1 microliter), synergistically potentiated the action of noradrenaline on UNaV (3.22 +/- 0.25 to 4.02 +/- 0.27 microEq min-1 100 g body weight-1) and on urinary potassium excretion (UKV) (0.70 +/- 0.08 to 1.15 +/- 0.12 microEq min-1 100 g body weight-1). The beta-adrenergic blockers metoprolol (100 nmol in 1 microliter) and propranolol (100 nmol in 1 microliter) had no synergistic or antagonistic action on the sodium excretion fraction, suggesting that neither of these receptors is present in LHA. Our results indicate that natriuresis occurs even in the absence of changes in glomerular filtration rate and demonstrate an inhibitory natriuretic effect of an alpha-1 blocker (prazosin) injected into the LHA before adrenaline, while an alpha-2 antagonist (yohimbine) yielded a potentiating effect.",

The main subjective side effects are somnolence, dizziness and dryness of the mouth. No serious metabolic side effects have been observed. Ketanserin can lead to a prolongation of the QTc interval and therefore should not be given to patients with preexisting QTc prolongation, atrioventricular or sinoauricular block of higher degree or with severe bradycardia (less than 50/min). If a diuretic is to be prescribed simultaneously, it must contain a potassium-sparing component. Since its antihypertensive effect is more pronounced in older age, ketanserin should preferentially be given to patients over 60 years of age.", 
    "86": "A total of 61 hypertensive patients treated during more than six months with antihypertensive drugs and showing a satisfactory evolution and normal basal arterial pressure values were studied. Patients were subjected to a psychological stress test in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the pharmacological treatment during and after an emotional situation. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) were measured in three instances: before (I), during (II) and after the test (III). Patients were divided in two groups: a) moderate hypertensive subjects (N = 38) treated with thiazides and beta-blockers and b) severe hypertensive subjects (N = 23) treated with the same drugs plus clonidine. A group of 26 normotensive subjects was used as control. Reactivity was determined comparing SAP and DAP values in instances I and II, whereas the recovery phase was evaluated by comparing instances I and III. SAP and DAP reactivity were highest in severe hypertensive patients and lowest in normal subjects. SAP and DAP recovery was partial in severe hypertensive subjects and complete in the other two groups. All reactivity and recovery differences were statistically significant. These results suggest that antihypertensives treatment that normalized basal arterial pressure values in these patients was not sufficiently effective to protect them during a psychological stress situation.", 
    "87": "To determine the differential release of gonadotropins in acutely orchidectomized rats, a single injection of the beta-adrenergic blocker Bornaprolol (FM 24) was administered to the animals and plasma FSH and LH levels were determined. FM 24 produced low plasma FSH levels only when injected 16 h before starting the blood collection and had no effect on FSH levels at 0, 30 and 46 h after its administration. However, it produced low LH plasma levels at 0, 16 and 30 h after administration. These findings confirm that pituitary beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in plasma LH release and suggest that they could also be involved in the differential release of FSH/LH.", 
    "88": "The acid-base equilibria of a series of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in acetonitrile have been studied, and pKHB+ values determined. The theory of such titrations is discussed and simple potentiometric and visual methods in acetonitrile media are proposed for the assay of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs.", 
    "89": "beta-receptor antagonists have for many years been considered appropriate alternatives in the primary management of mild to moderate hypertension. Generally, they have been shown to be safe with a low frequency of serious side-effects. Among the predictable and usually doserelated side-effects are bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension, muscle fatigue and cold extremities. Examples of unexpected side-effects are gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and disturbed intestinal motility, skin reactions, sexual dysfunction, as well as effects related to the central nervous system (CNS) such as emotional disturbances. The CNS-related side-effects, the mechanisms of which are unclear, consist of subtle effects on general well-being, decreased initiative, a depressed frame of mind and disturbed sleep. Generally, however, beta-blockers in therapeutic dosages do not affect the qualitative functions of the brain. Thus, all beta-blockers on the market seem to have high benefit-risk ratio, but independent of their physiochemical properties and pharmacodynamic profile, they seem to cause side-effects to about the same extent. The results so far available have been obtained by primarily using objective methods. Further comparison has now been initiated using documented subjective methods to investigate whether the objectively documented differences are of any clinical relevance to the patient's quality of life. Although it cannot be claimed with certainty, nonselective beta-blockers seem to cause CNS-related side-effects to a greater extent than beta 1-selective blockers. Differences in the degree of hydrophilicity of the beta-blocker are apparently of no clinical relevance in this respect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "Minor Symptoms Evaluation Profile (MSE-profile) is an instrument for the assessment of subjective CNS-related symptoms and has recently been documented. This self-applied questionnaire includes 24 items and uses a visual analogue scale to record perceived symptoms. Based on a subjective grouping followed by a principal component analysis of the results of 374 individuals to confirm the grouping, 15 out of the 24 items were formed into three dimensions: Contentment (7 items), Vitality (5 items) and Sleep (3 items). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient used to evaluate the internal consistency of these dimensions was 0.81, 0.81 and 0.77, respectively. Compared with the equivalent dimensions of other questionnaires for measurement of health-related quality of life, the dimensions of the MSE-profile were found to be relevant. Furthermore, the MSE-profile showed good discriminative ability to distinguish symptom profiles of patients with other diseases/complaints than hypertension. It can be concluded that the MSE-profile is practically useful, reliable and sensitive enough for the assessment of subjective CNS-related symptoms that might affect the patient's well-being/quality of life.", 
    "91": "In a placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective, parallel, double-masked trail we study corneal sensitivity before and after application of 2% carteolol (20 eyes) and 0.6% metipranolol (20 eyes). 2% carteolol does not decrease corneal sensitivity (no significant difference to the placebo group). 0.6% metipranolol leads to a decrease of corneal sensitivity up to 14 mg/S (median), lasting up to 15 minutes. The local anesthetic effect is an important parameter for the subjective compatibility.", 
    "92": "Beagles were treated with bisoprolol, a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, for 30 days with the following daily doses: oral: 30 mg/kg; conjunctival: 0.5% solution (approx. 0.04 mg/kg) and 5% solution (approx. 0.4 mg/kg). Drug concentrations were determined in plasma and various eye tissues on days 1, 16, and 30, and on day 59, i.e. on day 29 of the follow-up period. Bisoprolol concentrations in plasma and most eye tissues were considerably higher after oral than after conjunctival treatment. The highest tissue concentrations were observed in the iris (+ciliary body) and retina (+choroid) with tissue/plasma concentration ratios between 100 and 150 after oral and 1000 to 3000 after conjunctival instillation (5% solution). In plasma no accumulation of the drug was observed which is in accordance with its plasma half-life of 4 to 5 h. In contrast to this, concentrations in the iris and retina increased from day 1 to day 16 and 30 by 3 to 8 times and the half-life of bisoprolol in these tissues was estimated to be between 3 to 5 days."
