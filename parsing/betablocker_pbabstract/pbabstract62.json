Polymorphisms associated with blood pressure response at P<10(-5) were tested for replication of the associations in independent samples of hydrochlorothiazide-treated European hypertensives. The rs16960228 polymorphism in protein kinase C, \u03b1 replicated for same-direction association with diastolic blood pressure response in the Nordic Diltiazem study (n=420) and the Genetics of Drug Responsiveness in Essential Hypertension study (n=206), and the combined 4-study meta-analysis P value achieved genome-wide significance (P=3.3 \u00d7 10(-8)). Systolic or diastolic blood pressure responses were consistently greater in carriers of the rs16960228 A allele than in GG homozygotes (>4/4 mm Hg) across study samples. The rs2273359 polymorphism in the GNAS-EDN3 region also replicated for same-direction association with systolic blood pressure response in the Nordic Diltiazem study, and the combined 3-study meta-analysis P value approached genome-wide significance (P=5.5 \u00d7 10(-8)). The findings document clinically important effects of genetic variation at novel loci on blood pressure response to a thiazide diuretic, which may be a basis for individualization of antihypertensive drug therapy and identification of new drug targets.", 
    "1": "The objective of this work was to develop and evaluate a floating-pulsatile drug delivery of atenolol. The floating-pulsatile concept was applied to increase the gastric residence of the dosage form by having lag phase followed by a burst release. The system was generated which consisted of three different parts: a core tablet, containing the active ingredient; an erodible outer shell; and a top cover buoyant layer. The dry, coated tablet consists in a drug-containing core, coated by a hydrophilic erodible polymer responsible for a lag phase in the onset of pulsatile release. The buoyant layer, prepared with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) K100 M, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate, provides buoyancy to increase the retention of the oral dosage form in the stomach. The effect of the hydrophilic erodible polymer characteristics on the lag time and drug release was investigated. Developed formulations were evaluated for their physical properties in vitro release as well as in vivo behavior. The results showed that K3 (180 mg of HPMC K4 M) and K6 (290 mg of HPMC E15 LV) with a buoyant layer were the best formulation, with lag times of 5.2 \u00b1 0.1 h and 4.1 \u00b1 0.2 h, respectively. Floating time was controlled by the quantity and composition of the buoyant layer. In-vitro results point out the capability of the system with its prolonged residence of the tablets in the stomach and release of drug after a programmed lag time. This was confirmed by in vivo x-ray technique.",

The system consist of three different parts: a core tablet, containing the active ingredient; a bottom layer that erodes; and a top cover floating layer. Atenolol, a \u03b2-blocker, is prescribed widely in diverse cardiovascular diseases, for example, hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.

    "3": "A case-case-control study was conducted to identify independent risk factors for recovery of Escherichia coli strains producing CTX-M-type extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (CTX-M E. coli) within a large Southeastern Michigan medical center. Unique cases with isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli from February 2010 through July 2011 were analyzed by PCR for blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV genes. Patients with CTX-M E. coli were compared to patients with E. coli strains not producing CTX-M-type ESBLs (non-CTX-M E. coli) and uninfected controls. Of 575 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli, 491 (85.4%) isolates contained a CTX-M ESBL gene. A total of 319 (84.6%) patients with CTX-M E. coli (282 [74.8%] CTX-M-15 type) were compared to 58 (15.4%) non-CTX-M E. coli patients and to uninfected controls. Independent risk factors for CTX-M E. coli isolation compared to non-CTX-M E. coli included male gender, impaired consciousness, H2 blocker use, immunosuppression, and exposure to penicillins and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Compared to uninfected controls, independent risk factors for isolation of CTX-M E. coli included presence of a urinary catheter, previous urinary tract infection, exposure to oxyimino-cephalosporins, dependent functional status, non-home residence, and multiple comorbid conditions. Within 48 h of admission, community-acquired CTX-M E. coli (n = 51 [16%]) and non-CTX-M E coli (n = 11 [19%]) strains were isolated from patients with no recent health care contacts. CTX-M E. coli strains were more resistant to multiple antibiotics than non-CTX-M E. coli strains. CTX-M-encoding genes, especially bla(CTX-M-15) type, represented the most common ESBL determinants from ESBL-producing E. coli, the majority of which were present upon admission. Septic patients with risk factors for isolation of CTX-M E. coli should be empirically treated with appropriate agents. Regional infection control efforts and judicious antibiotic use are needed to control the spread of these organisms.",

Distinguishing a cardiogenic seizure from a neurogenic one is of the utmost importance. Herein, we present the case of a 12-year-old boy with recurrent episodes of syncope and seizures. Despite absence of QT prolongation on electrocardiogram, absence of documented arrhythmias, a negative LQTS genetic test, and recurrent episodes while on nadolol beta-blocker therapy, he was diagnosed with LQTS and implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). When syncope and seizure occurred with normal sinus rhythm documented on the ICD, he was referred to neurology, and an electroencephalogram was positive for numerous bursts of bilaterally synchronous generalized discharges. He was started on antiepileptic treatment after which his seizures resolved. His LQTS diagnosis was removed, beta-blocker therapy discontinued, and his ICD was explanted. He has been seizure-free for over 2 years.",

Group III had a significant decrease of urinary levels of total protein, N-acetyl-\u03b2-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and \u03b3-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT) and urinary 8-isoprostanes than those of group II. Telmisartan decreased the systolic blood pressure significantly than those of group II. Histopathological examination revealed that cadmium-induced renal tissue damage was ameliorated by telmisartan treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that telmisartan significantly decreased the cadmium-induced overexpression of parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1) in renal tissue.

Different mixtures of materials (microcrystalline cellulose [MCC], hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC], lactose [LAC], dicalcium phosphate [DCP], coumarin [COU], propranolol hydrochloride [PRO], water [W]) were prepared prior to laminar extrusion. Mono, bi and tri layer extrudates were manufactured and evaluated for extrudability, drying, water uptake and swelling ability and in vitro characterization of the drug release. Good quality extrudates were manufactured with higher HPMC molecular weight and fraction in formulation at an extrusion rate of 400 mm/min and slow drying (forced air stream), otherwise surface roughness, thickness in-homogeneity, bending and shark skin were present in the extrudates. Swelling of extrudates was dependent on HPMC fraction and molecular weight (60% up to 90% weight gain for low and high polymer chains, respectively) and the presence of either MCC or DCP. The release of drug was dependent on its solubility (PRO>COU), the fraction of HPMC (low>high fractions), the type of diluent (DCP>MCC) and number of layers (1>2>3 layers).

In this study we addressed the relationships between increased cAMP and \u03b2-catenin. In cholangiocytes isolated and cultured from Pkhd1(del4/del4) mice, stimulation of cAMP/PKA signaling (forskolin 10 \u03bcM) stimulated Ser(675) -phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin, its nuclear localization, and its transcriptional activity (western blot and TOP flash assay, respectively) along with a down-regulation of E-cadherin expression (immunocytochemistry and western blot); these changes were inhibited by the PKA blocker, PKI (1 \u03bcM). The Rho-GTPase, Rac-1, was also significantly activated by cAMP in Pkhd1(del4/del4) cholangiocytes.

The aim of this work was to define the physicochemical boundaries of compounds within this technology and their relation to in vivo release using a series of model compounds with high permeability but varying solubility. In vitro data demonstrated a good correlation between solubility and initial release rates from the gels. In vivo studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats to compare the exposure profile of compounds dosed in gel relative to a standard formulation.

    "58": "Heart failure is accompanied with tissue (circulatory) hypoxia, and the metabolism of several drugs has been reported to be reduced in heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of another type of respiratory hypoxia, hypoxic hypoxia (FiO2 15 % for 24 h followed by FiO2 10 % for 9 days) on the metabolism of carvedilol enantiomers in rats. Oxidation of carvedilol in rat liver microsomes was evaluated in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, whereas glucuronidation was evaluated in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid. Both oxidation and glucuronidation activities for two carvedilol enantiomers in hypoxic rat liver microsomes were similar to those in control rat liver microsomes. We also performed pharmacokinetic analysis of carvedilol enantiomers following intraportal infusion in control and hypoxic rats. The mean (\u00b1S.E.) portal clearance value of R- and S-carvedilol in control rats was 72 \u00b1 16 and 156 \u00b1 31 ml/min/kg, respectively, whereas that of the R- and S-enantiomers in hypoxic rats was 68 \u00b1 8 and 113 \u00b1 14 ml/min/kg, respectively. These findings indicated that the metabolism of carvedilol enantiomers was not significantly diminished in rats with chronic hypoxic hypoxia, and that other factor(s) besides hypoxia may be responsible for the reduced drug metabolism in heart failure.", 
    "59": "The hippocampus is a limbic structure that is involved in the expression of defensive reactions and autonomic changes in rats. The injection of L-glutamate (L-glu) into the ventral hippocampus (VH) decreases blood pressure and heart rate in anesthetized rats. Activation of NMDA receptors in the VH increases the production of nitric oxide (NO), leading to guanylate cyclase activation. The hypothesis of the present study was that a local NMDA receptor-NO-guanylate cyclase interaction mediates the cardiovascular effects of microinjection of L-glu into the VH. Microinjection of increasing doses of L-glu (30, 60 and 200 nmol/200 nL) into the VH of conscious rats caused dose-related pressor and tachycardiac responses. The cardiovascular effects of L-glu were abolished by local pretreatment with: the glutamate receptor antagonist AP-7 (0.4 nmol); the selective neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inhibitor N(\u03c9)-Propyl-L-arginine (0.04 nmol); the NO scavenger C-PTIO (2 nmol) or the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolol [4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (2 nmol). Moreover, these cardiovascular responses were blocked by intravenous pretreatment with: the ganglionic blocker mecamylamine (2mg/Kg); the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2mg/Kg); the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist atenolol (1mg/kg). However, pretreatment with the selective \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin (0,5mg/kg) caused only a small reduction in the pressor response, without affecting the L-glu evoked tachycardia. In conclusion, our results suggest that cardiovascular responses caused by L-glu microinjection into the VH are mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors and involve local nNOS and guanylate cyclase activation. Moreover, these cardiovascular responses are mainly mediated by cardiac sympathetic nervous system activation, with a small involvement of the vascular sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "60": "This study aimed to investigate how stimulation of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the anteroventral third ventricular region (AV3V; a pivotal forebrain area for autonomic functions) and other brain regions affects heart rate (HR) in conscious rats. Topical injections of the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (Isop) into the AV3V caused dose-related and reversible increases in HR. Only its highest dose utilized significantly affected blood pressure (BP), inducing a decrease. The tachycardia due to AV3V Isop lasted significantly longer than that elicited by hypotension, and was inhibited by AV3V administration of the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or systemic infusion of a ganglion blocker hexamethonium. Plasma noradrenaline indicative of sympathetic nerve activity increased in parallel with rises in HR after the AV3V application of Isop. When Isop was locally injected into various brain regions other than the AV3V, region-related effectiveness in provoking tachycardia was observed that tended to be large in limbic structures and the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. No region responded to Isop applications with decreases in HR. These results suggest that \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the AV3V and other brain regions may be able to produce tachycardia by enhancing, at least in part, the efferent sympathetic nerve activity controlling cardiac function.",

Intensive studies have demonstrated its antimicrobial and chemotactic activities in vitro. In this study, ELISA analysis showed that HBD2 was significantly downregulated in sera of patients with hypertension. It relaxed vessel smooth muscle by acting on the major regulatory pathways, contributing to vessel smooth muscle contraction. Electrophysiology analysis indicated that HBD2 acted as an opener of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated potassium (BKCa)-mSlo+h\u03b21 channels and increased BKCa currents. Mutation analysis revealed that HBD2 activated BKCa-mSlo+h\u03b21 channels via interacting with Leu41 and Gln43 of \u03b21-loop. In vivo experiments suggested that HBD2 at 4 \u00d7 to 6 \u00d7 of physiological concentration exerted hypotensive effect in monkeys significantly, whereas the selective blocker of BKCa channels, Paxilline, inhibited the effect. HBD2 is the first peptide opener of BKCa-mSlo+h\u03b21 channels. It may be a novel regulator of blood pressure and provides a new therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension.

Abdominal obesity, characterized by ectopic fat deposition in skeletal muscle and liver tissue, has been associated with insulin resistance and increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 (AT-1) receptor blocker telmisartan can reduce intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and hepatic fat storage, thereby improving insulin sensitivity among individuals with abdominal obesity. METHODS. Ninety-five adults with abdominal obesity (body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m(2) and waist circumference > 102 cm in men and > 88 cm in women) were randomized to double-blind treatment with telmisartan or placebo for 24 weeks. Following 4 weeks of 80 mg telmisartan per day, the dose was increased to 160 mg telmisartan for the duration of the study. Soleus muscle IMCL and liver fat content were assessed by (1)H-magnetic resonance imaging ((1)H-MRI) spectroscopy. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition, plasma lipids, glucose profiles, insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function and total adiponectin levels. RESULTS. There was no significant effect of telmisartan in abdominally obese individuals consuming either a low or high glycemic diet, on IMCL content (5.73 \u00b1 1.11 vs 6.11 \u00b1 1.11; p = 0.13) or liver fat (0.08 \u00b1 0.05 vs 0.09 \u00b1 0.05; p = 0.60). Body composition, lipid and glucose profiles, insulin sensitivity and adiponectin were likewise unaffected. Beta-cell function, as determined by the insulinogenic index (IGI), improved significantly (19.3 \u00b1 13.7 vs 22.5 \u00b1 17.6; p = 0.03; 16.5% increase from baseline in the telmisartan group). CONCLUSIONS. Telmisartan increased beta-cell function but did not decrease IMCL or liver fat content or other metabolic parameters among individuals with abdominal obesity.", 
    "77": "Obesity is an epidemic, calling for innovative and reliable pharmacological strategies. Here, we show that ShK-186, a selective and potent blocker of the voltage-gated Kv1.3 channel, counteracts the negative effects of increased caloric intake in mice fed a diet rich in fat and fructose. ShK-186 reduced weight gain, adiposity, and fatty liver; decreased blood levels of cholesterol, sugar, HbA1c, insulin, and leptin; and enhanced peripheral insulin sensitivity. These changes mimic the effects of Kv1.3 gene deletion. ShK-186 did not alter weight gain in mice on a chow diet, suggesting that the obesity-inducing diet enhances sensitivity to Kv1.3 blockade. Several mechanisms may contribute to the therapeutic benefits of ShK-186. ShK-186 therapy activated brown adipose tissue as evidenced by a doubling of glucose uptake, and increased \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids, glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and uncoupling protein 1 expression. Activation of brown adipose tissue manifested as augmented oxygen consumption and energy expenditure, with no change in caloric intake, locomotor activity, or thyroid hormone levels. The obesity diet induced Kv1.3 expression in the liver, and ShK-186 caused profound alterations in energy and lipid metabolism in the liver. This action on the liver may underlie the differential effectiveness of ShK-186 in mice fed a chow vs. an obesity diet.

Treatment for families with ARVD/C is directed toward prevention of sudden cardiac death, prevention or delay of disease progression, and adjustment to life with a lifelong chronic genetic disease. As there have been no randomized trials of ARVD/C treatments or screening regimens, treatment decisions are based on clinical expertise, results of retrospective registry-based studies, and understanding of pathologic mechanisms of disease. The first step for treatment is securing an accurate diagnosis through careful application of the diagnostic Task Force criteria. Following diagnosis in an index case, family members are screened. We advise affected individuals and gene carriers to dramatically reduce exercise and strongly recommend that ARVD/C patients discontinue competitive athletics. We generally recommend implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement in all probands who meet Task Force criteria, especially if they have a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), arrhythmogenic syncope, or frequent ventricular ectopy and/or nonsustained VT. We are more circumspect about recommending implantation of an ICD in a family member who has been diagnosed with ARVD/C through family screening, as these individuals are now being identified at a much earlier stage in their disease than was possible previously. Anti-arrhythmic medications and catheter ablation are used to decrease the frequency of ventricular tachycardia and associated implantable cardioverter defibrillator therapies.

Human normal lower urinary tract tissue was obtained for the evaluation of endogenous H2S productivity using a sulphide-sensitive electrode and for the analysis of the expression levels of all three synthases of endogenous H2S, cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS), cystathionine \u03b3 lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulphur transferase (MPST, as known as 3-MST) by Western blot assay. CBS, CSE and MPST were located in human sample slides by immunohistochemistry. Human and male adult SD rat bladder strips were tested for H2S function with a transducer and recorded. All experiments were repeated six times. The endogenous H2S productivity and the H2S synthases had various distributions in the human and rat lower urinary tract tissues and were located in both epithelial and stromal sections. L-cysteine (L-Cys, a substrate of CBS, CSE and MPST) elicited relaxation in a dose-dependent manner on human bladder strips pre-contracted by acetylcholine chloride. This effect could be diminished by the ATP-sensitive potassium ion (KATP) channel blocker glibenclamide (GLB), the CSE inhibitor DL-propargylglycine (PPG) and the CBS inhibitor hydroxylamine (HA). H2S and its three synthases were present in the human and rat lower urinary tract tissues and relaxed human and rat bladder strips, which implied that endogenous H2S might play a role in physiological function and pathological disorders of the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or overactive bladder (OAB).",

We created MI by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in male mice, and these mice were orally administered saline (0.2 mL) in the control group (Group C), 0.1 mg/kg/d of azilsartan in the low dose group (Group L), and 1.0 mg/kg/d in the high dose group (Group H) everyday. Blood pressure was decreased in Group H, but not in Group L, compared to Group C. At 2 weeks after MI creation, infarct size and fibrotic change at the site remote to the myocardial infarcted area were attenuated in Group L and Group H compared to Group C. Echocardiography revealed that cardiac remodeling was suppressed in Group L and Group H compared to Group C.

However, the relationship between MC and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) is still ambiguous. The purpose of this study was to establish an evaluation method of CBF as an index of mucociliary function and examine the relationship between MC and CBF. A sequence of images of ciliary beating of an excised rat nasal septum was captured using a high-speed digital video camera. CBF (beats per second, Hz) was determined from periodic changes in the contrast value of a specific location in a sequence of images. CBF under control conditions was 8.49\u00b10.38 Hz, which is similar to values reported for cultured human nasal epithelial cells and rat tracheal cells. \u03b2-Adrenergic and cholinergic antagonists decreased CBF, while \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and acetylcholine increased CBF.

The purpose of this hypothesis-generating study was to test whether moxonidine, a centrally acting sympathoinhibitory agent, on top of optimal antihypertensive treatment, can lead to a decrease in AF burden in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF. This was a prospective, double-blind, 1-group, crossover study. Hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF sequentially received treatment with placebo and moxonidine for two 6-week periods, respectively. The change in AF burden (measured as minutes of AF per day in three 48-hour Holter recordings) between the 2 treatment periods was the primary outcome measure. Fifty-six patients (median age 63.5 years, 35 men) were included. During moxonidine treatment, AF burden was reduced from 28.0 min/day (interquartile range [IQR] 15.0 to 57.8) to 16.5 min/day (IQR 4.0 to 36.3; p <0.01). European Heart Rhythm Association symptom severity class decreased from a median of 2.0 (IQR 1.0 to 2.0) to 1.0 (IQR 1.0 to 2.0; p = 0.01). Systolic blood pressure levels were similar in the 2 treatment periods, whereas diastolic blood pressure was lower (p <0.01) during moxonidine treatment. The most frequent complaint was dry mouth (28.6%). No serious adverse events were recorded.

Ten pellets from each batch were mapped individually to evaluate the coating thickness and drug layer thickness between batches, between pellets within each batch, and across individual pellets (uniformity). From the terahertz waveform the terahertz electric field peak strength (TEFPS) was used to define a circular area (approximately 0.13 mm(2)) in the TPI maps, where no signal distortion was found due to pellet curvature in the measurement set-up used. The average coating thicknesses were 46 \u03bcm, 71 \u03bcm and 114 \u03bcm, for batches I, II and III respectively, whilst no drug layer thickness difference between batches was observed. No statistically significant differences in the average coating thickness and drug layer thickness within batches (between pellets) but high thickness variability across individual pellets was observed. These results were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The coating thickness results correlated with the subsequent drug release behaviour. The fastest drug release was obtained from batch I with the lowest coating thickness and the slowest from batch III with the highest coating thickness.

Five separate clinical trials studying the effects of \u03b2-blockade therapy in patients with Marfan syndrome are analyzed, in addition to four other clinical trials studying the effects of \u03b2-blockade therapy in patients without Marfan syndrome.

The aim of the present study was to examine the variability of bioavailability (F) of bisoprolol in routinely treated Japanese patients and intestinal absorption characteristics of the drug. We first analyzed the plasma concentration data of bisoprolol in 52 Japanese patients using a nonlinear mixed effects model. We also investigated the cellular uptake of bisoprolol using human intestinal epithelial LS180 cells. The oral clearance (CL/F) of bisoprolol in Japanese patients was positively correlated with the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), implying variable F. The uptake of bisoprolol in LS180 cells was temperature-dependent and saturable, and was significantly decreased in the presence of quinidine and diphenhydramine. In addition, the cellular uptake of bisoprolol dissolved in an acidic buffer was markedly less than that dissolved in a neutral buffer.

However, there is little information on the impact of cocaine self-administration on D1-NMDA receptor interactions in this brain region. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we assessed whether cocaine self-administration alters the effects of D1DR stimulation on synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In slices from cocaine-naive rats, pretreatment with a D1DR agonist decreased synaptic NMDAR-mediated currents and increased the contribution of extrasynaptic NMDARs. In contrast, neither cocaine self-administration alone nor cocaine experience followed by D1DR stimulation had an effect on synaptic or extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling. Activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs relies on the availability of extracellular glutamate, which is regulated primarily by glutamate transporters. In cocaine-experienced animals, relative to cocaine-naive rats, administration of a glutamate reuptake blocker, DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartic acid, revealed increased extrasynaptic NMDAR activity and stronger baseline activity of glutamate uptake transporters. In cocaine-naive rats, the D1DR-mediated increase in extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling was independent of the activity of glutamate reuptake transporters. Together, these results indicate that cocaine experience blunts the influence of D1DRs on synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling. Additionally, prior cocaine self-administration limits activation of the extrasynaptic NMDAR pool by increasing glutamate reuptake. These findings outline a pattern of adaptive interactions between D1DRs and NMDARs in the nucleus accumbens shell and demonstrate upregulation of extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling as a novel consequence of cocaine self-administration.",

    "141": "A fascinating yet perhaps overlooked trait of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) is its ability to bind ligands with no obvious neurotrophic function. Using cultured basal forebrain (BF) neurons, this study demonstrates selective internalization of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) 1-42 in conjunction with p75(NTR) (labelled with IgG192-Cy3) by cholinergic cells. Active under resting conditions, this process was enhanced by high K(+) stimulation and was insensitive to inhibitors of regulated synaptic activity-tetrodotoxin or botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT type/A and/B). Blockade of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) Ca(2+) ATPase with thapsigargin and CPA or chelation of Ca(2+) with EGTA-AM strongly suppressed the endocytosis of p75(NTR), implicating the role of ER released Ca(2+). The uptake of IgG192-Cy3 was also reduced by T-type Ca(2+) channel blocker mibefradil but not Cd(2+), an indiscriminate blocker of high voltage-activated Ca(2+) currents. A strong co-localization of IgG192-Cy3 with late endosome (Rab7) or lysosome (Lamp1) qualifier proteins suggest these compartments as the primary destination for internalized IgG192 and A\u03b2. Selective uptake and labeling of BF cholinergic cells with IgG192-Cy3 injected into the prefrontal cortex was verified also in vivo. The significance of these findings in relation to A\u03b2 clearance in the cerebral cortex and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is discussed.",

Possible pathogenetic mechanisms include severe hypotension due to hypovolaemic shock and coronary spasm with subsequent thrombosis of coronary vessels developed after the release of vasoactive, inflammatory and thrombogenic substances contained in the scorpion venom. All of the previously reported cases had normal coronary angiogram. We report a case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with severe scorpion sting and was treated with prazosin. But a few hours later, she developed acute anterior wall MI. Coronary angiogram revealed the presence of significant stenosis in coronary arteries. As acute MI owing to significant coronary artery disease can be evident after severe scorpion envenomation, so every case of acute coronary syndrome following scorpion sting needs early diagnosis, thorough cardiovascular evaluation and appropriate treatment.",

Sixty eyes of thirty patients with glaucoma due to use of topical steroids for >1 year. IOP range was 22-30 mm of Hg, visual field with (MD) mean deviation >6 to 12 dB and (MS) mean sensitivity >12-21dB, C:D ratio 0.7-0.8 and visual acuity 6/9 to 6/6 were included in this study. At first, topical steroid was stopped. Sample was collected in lottery method. Patients were divided into two groups. In Group I, 30 eyes were treated with Timolol maleate 0.5%. In Group II, 30 eyes were treated surgically by Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin-C. Follow-up were done on 1st POD, after 7 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Successful IOP control (<15mm of Hg) were achieved in 23 eyes (77%) in Group I and 30 eyes (100%) in Group II and were highly significant (p<0.001). Visual acuity and mean sensitivity also improved more in Group II than the Group I. It was also highly significant (p<0.001). So, Trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C is effective procedure in comparison to medical treatment for steroid induced glaucoma.",

The sensitivity and specificity of QTcF (cutoff value 450 ms) to discriminate between the LQTS patients and the HV were 51.5% and 98.9%, and for deltaT50 (cutoff value 3 ms) 93.9% and 88.6%, respectively. The combination of both variables improved the diagnosis of the LQTS patients even further. Subgroups of LQTS patients at higher risk of cardiac events (with LQTS3, JLN, QTc > 500 ms or symptoms) had higher deltaT50 than subgroups at lower risk (with LQTS1, QTc < 450 ms or without symptoms). The variation in deltaT50 between day and night was concordant with the risk of symptoms; patients with LQTS1 had higher deltaT50 in the daytime and patients with LQTS3 had higher deltaT50 during the night.", 
    "147": "DeltaT50 more accurately distinguished between LQTS patients and HV than QTcF and was higher in LQTS patients with a higher risk of cardiac events.

Typically during the landing phase of flight, she would feel dizzy and note that she had difficulty with speech and leg weakness. After the flight the leg weakness persisted for several days. The symptoms were mitigated when she took a combined alpha-beta blocker (labetalol) prior to the flight.", 
    "149": "To determine if these symptoms were related to atmospheric pressure change, she was referred for testing in a hyperbaric chamber. She was exposed to elevated atmospheric pressure (maximum 1.2 ATA) while her heart rate and blood pressure were monitored. Within 1 min she developed tachycardia and hypertension. She also quickly developed slurred speech, left arm and leg weakness, and sensory changes in her left leg. She was returned to sea level pressure and her symptoms gradually improved. A full neurological workup has revealed no explanation for these findings. She has no air collections, cysts, or other anatomic findings that could be sensitive to atmospheric pressure change.",

    "151": "We elucidated the autonomic mechanisms whereby heart rate (HR) is regulated by the muscle metaboreflex. Eight male participants (22 \u00b1 3 years) performed three exercise protocols: (1) enhanced metaboreflex activation with partial flow restriction (bi-lateral thigh cuff inflation) during leg cycling exercise, (2) isolated muscle metaboreflex activation (post-exercise ischaemia; PEI) following leg cycling exercise, (3) isometric handgrip followed by PEI. Trials were undertaken under control (no drug), \u03b21-adrenergic blockade (metoprolol) and parasympathetic blockade (glycopyrrolate) conditions. HR increased with partial flow restriction during leg cycling in the control condition (11 \u00b1 2 beats min(-1); P < 0.05). The magnitude of this increase in HR was similar with parasympathetic blockade (11 \u00b1 2 beats min(-1)), but attenuated with \u03b2-adrenergic blockade (4 \u00b1 1 beats min(-1); P < 0.05 vs. control and parasympathetic blockade). During PEI following leg cycling exercise, HR remained similarly elevated above rest under all conditions (11 \u00b1 2, 13 \u00b1 3 and 9 \u00b1 4 beats min(-1), for control, \u03b2-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade; P > 0.05 between conditions). During PEI following handgrip, HR was similarly elevated from rest under control and parasympathetic blockade (4 \u00b1 1 vs. 4 \u00b1 2 beats min(-1); P > 0.05 between conditions) conditions, but attenuated with \u03b2-adrenergic blockade (0.2 \u00b1 1 beats min(-1); P > 0.05 vs. rest). Thus muscle metaboreflex activation-mediated increases in HR are principally attributable to increased cardiac sympathetic activity, and only following exercise with a large muscle mass (PEI following leg cycling) is there a contribution from the partial withdrawal of cardiac parasympathetic tone.",

    "156": "Esmolol has a beneficial effect on the T helper 1/T helper 2 balance in patients with heart failure. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunomodulatory role of esmolol during and after surgery. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy due to gastric cancer were enrolled. Patients in the esmolol group (n = 15) received esmolol during surgery, and a saline-treated group (n = 14) served as a control. Cytokines were quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassays before, during and after surgery. The esmolol group was associated with higher ratios of interferon-\u03b3/interleukin-4 (T helper 1/T helper 2 signature cytokines) than the saline group during (2.36 vs 0.57, respectively, p = 0.041) and after (5.79 vs 0.69, respectively, p = 0.033) surgery. The postoperative increase in interleukin-6 was attenuated in the esmolol group, and the C-reactive protein level on postoperative day 1 was significantly lower in the esmolol group than in the saline group (mean (SD) 26.2 (18.3) mmol.l(-1) vs 56.8 (44.3) mmol.l(-1), p = 0.021).

    "157": "Alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells play a crucial role in the repair and remodeling of the lung following injury. ATII cells have the capability to proliferate and differentiate into alveolar type I (ATI) cells in vivo and into an ATI-like phenotype in vitro. While previous reports indicate that the differentiation of ATII cells into ATI cells is a complex biological process, the underlying mechanism responsible for differentiation is not fully understood. To investigate factors involved in this differentiation in culture, we used a PCR array and identified several genes that were either up- or downregulated in ATI-like cells (day 6 in culture) compared with day 2 ATII cells. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA was increased nearly eightfold. We found that IGF-I was increased in the culture media of ATI-like cells and demonstrated a significant role in the differentiation process. Treatment of ATII cells with recombinant IGF-I accelerated the differentiation process, and this effect was abrogated by the IGF-I receptor blocker PQ401. We found that Wnt5a, a member of the Wnt-Frizzled pathway, was activated during IGF-I-mediated differentiation. Both protein kinase C and \u03b2-catenin were transiently activated during transdifferentiation. Knocking down Wnt5a using small-interfering RNA abrogated the differentiation process as indicated by changes in the expression of an ATII cell marker (prosurfactant protein-C). Treatment of wounded cells with either IGF-I or Wnt5a stimulated wound closure. These results suggest that IGF-I promotes differentiation of ATII to ATI cells through the activation of a noncanonical Wnt pathway.", 
    "158": "The efficacy of pharmacological interventions to prevent sudden arrhythmic death in patients with chronic heart failure remains limited. Evidence now suggests increased ventricular expression of hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels in hypertrophied and failing hearts contributes to their arrythmicity.

Ivabradine (7 mg/kg per day orally) significantly reduced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and improved survival among dnNRSF-Tg mice while having no significant effect on heart rate or cardiac structure or function. Ivabradine most likely prevented the increase in automaticity otherwise seen in dnNRSF-Tg ventricular myocytes. Moreover, cardiac-specific overexpression of HCN2 in mice (HCN2-Tg) made hearts highly susceptible to arrhythmias induced by chronic \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Indeed, ventricular myocytes isolated from HCN2-Tg mice were highly susceptible to \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation-induced abnormal automaticity, which was inhibited by ivabradine.",

DIMETRIS (dimethyl(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silyldiethylamine) is a new and interesting proposition in this field. This agent possesses strong nucleophilic properties and reacts selectively with hydroxyl groups. The derivatization reaction takes place in the absence of any catalysts. The derivatives possess good chromatographic properties and are easily detected by mass spectrometry. By introducing fluorine atoms into the structure of the derivatives, we were able to use an electron-capture detector for their GC determination. No degradation of new derivatives was observed after seven days of storage in a refrigerator or during the GC analyses. Unlike a number of acylation agents, DIMETRIS does not corrode the analytical equipment. In this work \u03b2-blockers and \u03b2-agonists were used for testing the derivatizing properties of DIMETRIS. Derivatization of these drugs was optimal at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min.

The Valsartan Heart Failure Trial study randomized patients with congestive heart failure to the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan versus placebo, in addition to baseline angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) therapy. Overall, valsartan was found to significantly reduce the combined morbidity and mortality end point compared with placebo, mainly due to a reduction in heart failure admissions. However, a subgroup analysis showed that patients receiving triple therapy with valsartan, an ACE-I and a \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker, appeared to do worse. These findings led to speculation that \"triple therapy\" with ARB, ACE-I, and nonselective \u03b2-blocker might be harmful, possibly due to excessive neurohormonal inhibition. In contrast, in the Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity-added study, the \"triple therapy\" combination of ARB, ACE-I, and \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocker was proven safe and beneficial.

    "177": "It has been shown in rodents and newborn babies that brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays an important role in the generation of heat for maintenance of core body temperature. BAT is responsible for the process of adaptive thermogenesis, which involves heat generation in response to a drop in the environment's temperature or to high energy intake from diet. In rodents, the process of BAT thermogenesis is controlled by activation of the \u03b23-adrenergic receptor (\u03b23-AR), which has a protective effect against development of obesity. Previously, it was generally thought that in humans, BAT dissipated after childhood and adopted an insignificant role in human physiology. However, over the past few years, it has been discovered that adult humans still possess fully functional BAT. Through imaging with F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans, it has been determined that not only does human BAT exist, but also it is still responsive to stimuli, such as a drop in the environment's temperature. Although some evidence exists for \u03b23-AR control of BAT thermogenesis in humans, this fact remains unclear due to a lack of highly selective \u03b23-AR agonists and antagonists which have an effect on the human body. With further investigation on thermogenesis receptor control and effect of BAT metabolism on whole body energy expenditure, BAT may serve as a potential target for the treatment and prevention of obesity and other metabolic conditions in humans.",

    "179": "Cardiotoxicity is a well-recognised complication of chemotherapy with anthracycline and/or trastuzumab, and its prevention remains an important challenge in cancer survivorship. Several successful preventative strategies have been identified in animal trials. We sought to assemble the clinical evidence that prophylactic pharmacological interventions could prevent left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure in patients undergoing chemotherapy.", 
    "180": "We undertook a systemic review of the evidence from randomised trials and observational studies where a prophylactic intervention was compared with a control arm in patients with a normal ejection fraction and no past history of heart failure. The primary outcome was development of heart failure (HF), a drop in ejection fraction (EF) or both. A random-effects model was used to combine relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and a meta-regression was undertaken to assess the impact of potential covariates.", 
    "181": "Data were collated from 14 published articles (n=2015 paediatric and adult patients) comprising 12 randomised controlled trials and two observational studies. The most studied chemotherapeutic agents were anthracyclines, and prophylactic agents included dexrazoxane, statins, beta-blocker and angiotensin antagonists. There were 304 cardiac events in the control arm compared to 83 in the prophylaxis arm (RR=0.31 [95% CI: 0.25-0.39], p<0.00001). Cardiac events were reduced with dexrazoxane (RR=0.35 [95% CI 0.27-0.45], p<0.00001), beta-blockade (RR=0.31 [95% CI 0.16-0.63], p=0.001), statin (RR=0.31 [95% CI 0.13-0.77], p=0.01) and angiotensin antagonists (RR=0.11 [95% CI 0.04-0.29], p<0.0001).",

Myocardial deformation magnitude increased (circumferential strain, -19.6 \u00b1 1.9% vs -21.2 \u00b1 2.5%; radial strain, 19.2 \u00b1 3.7% vs 22.6 \u00b1 4.1%, P < .05; longitudinal and circumferential strain rate, -0.88 \u00b1 0.11 vs -0.99 \u00b1 0.15 sec(-1) and -1.03 \u00b1 0.16 vs -1.18 \u00b1 0.18 sec(-1), respectively, P < .05 for both; peak twist, 8.98 \u00b1 3.2\u00b0 vs 11.1 \u00b1 2.9\u00b0, P < .05).

    "192": "The concept of chronotropic incompetence may have to be fine-tuned in an era of proven benefit of heart rate reducing therapy. It is illustrated in three patients with heart failure referred for heart transplantation evaluation. In patients one and two, symptoms of heart failure and exercise capacity improved by reducing the dose of the beta-blocking agent (case 1 and 2) and, in patient three, by additionally lowering the dose of amiodarone. Patient three showed reduced exercise tolerance, particularly during cycling albeit not during walking. Exercise tolerance during cycling improved after adaptation of the rate response parameters of his pacemaker. In conclusion, the three cases illustrate that chronotropic incompetence is a clinical reality, while a correct history taking and specific measures can solve the problem, reduce the complaints and even avoid more aggressive therapeutic options such as orthotopic transplantation.",

Disopyramide was added in 221 (74%) patients and pharmacological control of symptoms was achieved in 141 (64%) patients. Overall, 138 (46%) patients had surgical relief of obstruction (91% myectomy) and 6 (2%) alcohol septal ablation. At follow-up, resting gradients in the 299 patients had decreased from 61 \u00b1 44 to 10 \u00b1 25 mm\u2009Hg (P<0.0001); New York Heart Association class decreased from 2.7 \u00b1 0.7 to 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 (P<0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival at 10 years in the 299 advanced-care patients was 88% and did not differ from nonobstructed patients (P=0.28). Only 1 patient had sudden death, a low annual rate of 0.06%/y.

    "197": "Increased production of vasoconstrictive prostanoids, such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2 ), contributes to endothelial dysfunction and increased hepatic vascular tone in cirrhosis. TXA2 induces vasoconstriction by way of activation of the thromboxane-A2 /prostaglandin-endoperoxide (TP) receptor. This study investigated whether terutroban, a specific TP receptor blocker, decreases hepatic vascular tone and portal pressure in rats with cirrhosis due to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) or bile duct ligation (BDL). Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, endothelial dysfunction, liver fibrosis, hepatic Rho-kinase activity (a marker of hepatic stellate cell contraction), and the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway were measured in CCl4 and BDL cirrhotic rats treated with terutroban (30 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle for 2 weeks. Terutroban reduced portal pressure in both models without producing significant changes in portal blood flow, suggesting a reduction in hepatic vascular resistance. Terutroban did not significantly change arterial pressure in CCl4 -cirrhotic rats but decreased it significantly in BDL-cirrhotic rats. In livers from CCl4 and BDL-cirrhotic terutroban-treated rats, endothelial dysfunction was improved and Rho-kinase activity was significantly reduced. In CCl4 -cirrhotic rats, terutroban reduced liver fibrosis and decreased alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression without significant changes in the eNOS pathway. In contrast, no change in liver fibrosis was observed in BDL-cirrhotic rats but an increase in the eNOS pathway.", 
    "198": "Our data indicate that TP-receptor blockade with terutroban decreases portal pressure in cirrhosis. This effect is due to decreased hepatic resistance, which in CCl4 -cirrhotic rats was linked to decreased hepatic fibrosis, but not in BDL rats, in which the main mediator appeared to be an enhanced eNOS-dependent vasodilatation, which was not liver-selective, as it was associated with decreased arterial pressure. The potential use of terutroban for portal hypertension requires further investigation.", 
    "199": "This review will assess whether the 25-year-old evidence base to support routine prescribing of \u03b2-blockers after myocardial infarction (MI) is relevant to modern management.", 
    "200": "The evidence base to support the recommendation for the widespread use of \u03b2-blockers after MI was near-finalized in the mid-1980s. Whereas the use of intravenous \u03b2-blockers is waning, the routine use of oral \u03b2-blockers after MI is still regarded as evidence based. In the past 25 years, the introduction of coronary reperfusion and of effective nonreperfusion therapies has changed the natural history of MI and there have been substantial changes in the definition of MI. The relevance of old clinical trial data collected in patients who bear little resemblance to today's MI patients is questioned. Recent analyses have shown that there is no convincing evidence for the use of \u03b2-blockers as first-line therapy in hypertension or in patients with stable coronary heart disease. In contrast, the evidence base for the use of \u03b2-blockers in heart failure is strong and contemporary.", 
    "201": "A rational recommendation for the modern treatment of MI would be to limit the use of \u03b2-blockers in the post-MI patient to higher-risk patients with evidence of ongoing ischemia, heart failure, or left ventricular dysfunction. There is no evidence to support the routine use of oral \u03b2-blockers in low-risk MI patients."
