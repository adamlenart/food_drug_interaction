    "1": "Syncope is a common clinical problem and has many etiologies. Autonomic testing and, in particular, the tilt/orthostatic test have helped to positively diagnose neurocardiogenic syncope in a high proportion of such patients.", 
    "2": "Patient case notes and autonomic test charts were reviewed in 162 children aged 1 to 20 years (mean age 12.8 years) with syncope. The autonomic test consisted of orthostatic maneuver, carotid sinus massage, diving reflex, Valsalva maneuver and dose response to intravenous boluses of isoproterenol and phenylephrine. Serum levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine were drawn during the orthostatic test. After confirmation of neurocardiogenic syncope, treatment was begun with fludrocortisone and salt, and beta-adrenergic blocking agents were used as a second line of therapy when indicated.", 
    "3": "The orthostatic test was positive for neurocardiogenic syncope in 100 patients (62%) and negative in 62 (38%). Patients in the former group were older, were more often female and had a diminished response to carotid sinus massage, a higher Valsalva ratio and a higher supine epinephrine level. Both groups showed an increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine levels at 5 min of standing. In the orthostatic positive group at the time of syncope, norepinephrine levels decreased, whereas epinephrine levels increased. Patients in this group were also more sensitive to the vasodilating effect of isoproterenol but not to its chronotropic effects. Eleven patients had cardioinhibitory syncope (asystole > or = 3 s). Of these, three had pacemaker implantation. Fludrocortisone and salt used in 84 patients in the orthostatic positive group produced resolution of symptoms in 55 patients (65%) and improvement in 14 (17%). Ten patients received beta-blockers, with resolution in four and improvement in four.",

    "5": "Chronic exposure to mild unpredictable stress (CMS) has previously been found to cause an antidepressant-reversible decrease in the consumption of palatable sweet solutions. In the present study, in addition to confirming these behavioural observations, the binding properties of cortical beta-adrenergic and 5HT2 receptors, and hippocampal 5HT1A receptors were studied (using the ligands [3H]-dihydroalprenolol, [3H]-ketanserin and [3H]-8-OH-DPAT, respectively), following 7 weeks of CMS and 4 weeks of imipramine treatment (10 mg/kg per day). CMS increased Bmax for all three receptor systems. Imipramine decreased Bmax, reversing the effect of CMS, for beta-adrenergic and 5HT2 receptor binding, but increased Bmax for 5HT1A receptor binding. KDs were unaffected by either treatment. The beta-receptor and 5HT2 receptor binding data are consistent with accounts of antidepressant action derived from studies in normal animals, but the 5HT1A receptor binding data are more difficult to reconcile. In no case was there a good correlation between receptor binding and behavioural data.", 
    "6": "The effect of (R,S)-(3,4-dihydro 6,7-dimethoxy-isoquinoline-1-yl)-2-phenyl- N,N-di-[2-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-acetamide (LOE 908), a cation channel blocker in HL-60 promyeloblasts, was studied in the A7r5 smooth muscle cell line from rat thoracic aorta, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. At a holding potential of -60 mV, application of vasopressin induced a nonselective cation conductance in voltage-clamped A7r5 cells. The current-voltage relation was linear, and currents reversed close to 0 mV regardless of the chloride gradient. The activation of the nonselective cation conductance by vasopressin was not affected by dialysing cells with Ca(2+)-free internal solution. LOE 908 blocked this current in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 560 nM, whereas dihydropyridine-sensitive Ba2+ current through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels was blocked with an IC50 of 28 microM. Another organic blocker of receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry, 1-beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365), blocked both, the vasopressin-induced nonselective conductance and the voltage-activated Ba2+ current with similar IC50 values of 13 microM and 8 microM, respectively. The rank order of potency of inorganic blockers on the vasopressin-induced inward current was Gd3+ > La3+ > Cd2+. Vasopressin-induced non-selective cation current was also observed in pertussis toxin-pretreated A7r5 cells but was completely abolished after infusion of the GDP analogue, guanosine 5'-O-[3-thio]diphosphate, from the patch pipette. Furthermore, vasopressin induced a transient outward current, suggesting a Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-current, which overlapped with the nonselective cation conductance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "GP-2-128 is a novel catecholamine designed for transdermal iontophoretic delivery in patients with limited mobility to prevent deconditioning and muscular wasting. We characterized the interactions of this agent with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in vitro. In electrically stimulated rat left atria, GP-2-128 produced a concentration-dependent increase in contractile force. pD2 values for GP-2-128, isoproterenol (ISO), and dobutamine (DOB) were 10.6 +/- 0.12, 8.55 +/- 0.02, and 7.0 +/- 0.20, respectively. Metoprolol caused a shift in the concentration-effect curves for the three agonists. In spontaneously beating rat right atria, pD2 values of GP-2-128, ISO, and DOB are 10.4 +/- 0.24, 8.82 +/- 0.18, and 6.92 +/- 0.18, respectively. The affinity constant (KA) of GP-2-128, ISO, and DOB for cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors was determined by competition binding assays to be 8.09, 6.04 and 4.49, respectively. In guinea pig trachea precontracted with histamine, GP-2-128 and ISO produced a concentration-dependent relaxation. pD2 values were 10.0 +/- 0.1 and 8.2 +/- 0.1, respectively. DOB was more potent than GP-2-128 in contracting isolated rat aortic rings (alpha 1 effect) and in displacing [3H]rauwolscine (alpha 2 effect). We also studied the interactions of GP-2-128 and ISO with the atypical beta-adrenoceptors (beta 3) in guinea pig ilea and rat and hamster adipocytes. Both agents inhibited twitches produced by transmural nerve stimulation in the presence of 10(-5) M nadolol. The EC30 for GP-2-128 and ISO at this atypical receptor site were 4.25 x 10(-10) and 5.05 x 10(-8) M, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Systematic modification in the chemical structure of dobutamine resulted in production of a long-acting, highly potent catecholamine, GP-2-128 [(1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-[3-(4-carbamyl phenyl)-1-methylpropylamino] ethanol)]. The cardiovascular actions of GP-2-128 were compared with those of isoproterenol (ISO) and dobutamine (DOB) in anesthetized dogs. GP-2-128 significantly increased left ventricular pressure (LVdP/dtmax), cardiac output (CO), and heart rate (HR). It also reduced total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR). For a given increase in contractility, changes in HR were greater after ISO than after GP-2-128 administration. DOB did not change HR significantly. Both GP-2-128 and DOB reduced TPVR, but ISO was more effective than GP-2-128 and DOB in reducing TPVR. GP-2-128 was 18,000 and 52 times more potent than DOB and ISO, respectively, in increasing LVdP/dtmax. For a given increase in contractility, the cardiovascular actions of GP-2-128 lasted significantly longer than those of DOB or ISO. A 50% mixture of the RR and RS distereoisomer forms of GP-2-128 (GP-2-114) have the same pharmacologic profile as the pure RR distereoisomer. Both GP-2-128 and GP-2-114 produced current-dependent cardiovascular actions when administered by transdermal iontophoresis. The inotropic and chronotropic effects of GP-2-128 are both largely due to stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors, as shown by receptor blockade with propranolol. GP-2-128 is a very potent, long-acting catecholamine that can be administered by other than intravenous (i.v.) route.", 
    "9": "The Electrophysiological Study Versus Electrocardiographic Monitoring (ESVEM) trial randomized 486 patients with spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF) or unmonitored syncope, who manifested reproducibly inducible sustained ventricular arrhythmias by provocative stimulation and 10 or more premature ventricular contractions per hour on Holter monitoring, to two groups treated with pharmacotherapy guided by suppression of stimulation-inducible VT/VF or suppression of spontaneous or exercise induced ventricular arrhythmias. There was no difference over four years of follow-up in the rates of recurrence of arrhythmias, arrhythmic mortality, cardiac mortality, or mortality from any cause between the two groups of patients but more patients (77%) received pharmacotherapy in the group treated on the basis of suppression of spontaneous arrhythmias than the group treated on the basis of electrophysiological study. In this trial, rates of recurrence of arrhythmias were higher (37% at one year and 66% at four years) than generally reported, but cardiac and arrhythmia mortality were comparable or lower than generally reported. Of the seven agents tested, six were sodium channel blockers (imipramine, mexiletine, procainamide, propafenone, pirmenol, and quinidine) and the other was sotalol. Sotalol had a significantly higher rate of efficacy predictions by EPS (35%) than the others (15%) and a comparable rate by Holter monitor. Sotalol was significantly more efficacious in preventing recurrences, arrhythmic mortality, cardiac mortality, and total mortality than the other agents and it was better tolerated. Probability of successful long term therapy with a sodium channel blocker tested by electrophysiological study was low (5% at one year).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The only class of drugs with significant effects on ventricular fibrillation and sudden death in humans is that of beta-blockers. The exact mechanisms for these prophylactic effects are not known but may be related to both antiischemic or antiarrhythmic influences. It seems reasonable to suggest that one should use a beta-blocker with proven effect on total mortality and sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction as prophylaxis. Therefore, propranolol, timolol, or metoprolol, should be instituted in order to improve prognosis when there are no contraindications. In addition to possible effects on survival one would also expect to reduce the risk for new ischemic events with angina or reinfarction. In contrast, class I antiarrhythmic agents are useful for symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias but there is no proof for any effect on ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.", 
    "11": "We examined the mechanisms of bradykinin-induced airway microvascular leakage in guinea pig airways by measuring extravasation of Evans blue dye. Animals were pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg, intravenous) and atropine (1 mg/kg, intravenous) to block the beta-adrenergic and muscarinic responses, respectively. Bradykinin (250 nmol) instillation into airways significantly increased the leakage of dye in the trachea, main bronchi, and intrapulmonary airways to the same degree. The bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist HOE140 (500 nmol/kg, intravenous) did not alter basal leakage but almost completely inhibited bradykinin-mediated leakage. By contrast, the neurokinin NK1 antagonist FK888 (10 mg/kg, intravenous) partially inhibited bradykinin-induced leakage in trachea (p < 0.01) and main bronchi (p < 0.01), but had no significant effect on intrapulmonary airways. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, intravenous) had no effect on the plasma leakage after instilled bradykinin. We concluded that the airway inflammatory response to bradykinin administered directly into the airways is mediated by bradykinin B2 receptors and partially mediated by tachykinin release from sensory nerve terminals, whereas cyclooxygenase products have no important role in the response. In the central airways, the contribution of sensory neuropeptides to the bradykinin response is greater than that caused by direct stimulation of the B2 receptor on the endothelium at the postcapillary venule of the bronchial circulation. In contrast, in the peripheral airways, the contribution of direct B2-receptor stimulation on the airway vasculature is greater than that involving sensory neuropeptides.", 
    "12": "Advances in the treatment of the acute phase of myocardial infarction have lead to the need for adequate secondary treatment. beta-blockers have been largely demonstrated to be effective antianginal agents, acting on three determining factors: heart rate, systemic blood pressure and myocardial contractility. Used in secondary prevent treatment, beta-blockers lead to significant improvement in global post-myocardial infarction mortality, reduced from 9.4 to 7.6% and in reinfarction rates, reduced from 7.5 to 5.6%. Prescription of beta-blockers beyond the acute phase is an essential part of secondary prevention. For calcium antagonists however, there is no evidence of improved prognosis after myocardial infarction. There is no improvement in mortality or reinfarction rates. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs are not indicated as systematic treatment after myocardial infarction. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce long-term mortality and late occurrence of congestive heart failure, particularly in patients with moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction. Among the anti-thrombotic drugs, oral anticoagulants seem to offer no clear advantage over aspirin. Large trials of anti-arrhythmic agents have failed to demonstrate any clinical benefit in asymptomatic patients with ventricular ectopic beats, and the results of secondary prevention trials using amiodarone are still awaited. Myocardial revascularization using coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty should be proposed mainly in symptomatic patients or in subsets of patients with multi-vessel disease and altered left ventricular function. Finally, rehabilitation measures should be aimed at correcting cardiovascular risk factors and improving physical fitness.", 
    "13": "The authentic subunit compositions of neuronal K+ channels purified from bovine brain were analyzed using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 5), reactive exclusively with the Kv1.2 subunit of the latter and polyclonal antibodies specific for fusion proteins containing C-terminal regions of four mammalian Kv proteins. Western blotting of the K+ channels isolated from several brain regions, employing the selective blocker alpha-dendrotoxin (alpha-DTX), revealed the presence in each of four different Kvs. Variable amounts of Kv1.1 and 1.4 subunits were observed in the K+ channels purified from cerebellum, corpus striatum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and brain stem; on the other hand, contents of Kv1.6 and 1.2 subunits appeared uniform throughout. Each Kv-specific antibody precipitated a different proportion (anti-Kv1.2 > 1.1 > 1.6 > 1.4) of the channels detectable with radioiodinated alpha-DTX in every brain region, consistent with a widespread distribution of these oligomeric subtypes. Such heterooligomeric combinations were further documented by the lack of additivity upon their precipitation with a mixture of antibodies to Kv1.1 and Kv1.2; moreover, cross-blotting of the multimers precipitated by mAb 5 showed that they contain all four Kv proteins. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that subtypes of alpha-DTX-susceptible K+ channels are prevalent throughout mammalian brain which are composed of different Kv proteins assembled in complexes, shown previously to also contain auxiliary beta-subunits [Parcej, D. N., Scott, V. E. S., & Dolly, J.O. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 11084-11088].", 
    "14": "Labour was induced with propranolol and oxytocin in 60 female patients with prolonged pregnancy. An outcome was favourable in 88%. No effect of propranolol on fetal pulse rate and general maternal state was seen. Propranolol shortened I phase of labour by approximately 30% in primigravidae.", 
    "15": "The antiemetic effects of flesinoxan were evaluated following s.c. administration in cats. Flesinoxan produced a dose-dependent suppression of motion sickness and also reduced xylazine-induced emesis at higher doses. Flesinoxan had a short latency to onset and may have a brief duration of action. It was slightly more potent that 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), in contrast to their relative potencies on most other in vivo measures. High doses of both agonists produced defensive behavior as a result of 5-HT1A receptor stimulation. (-)-Propranolol, which previously reduced 8-OH-DPAT suppression of feline motion sickness, failed to reduce the antiemetic effect of flesinoxan. The dose of 3 mg/kg of NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine) produced a slight decrease in motion sickness and added to the suppression of motion sickness by low doses of flesinoxan via an uncertain mechanism. It also reduced the antiemetic effect of higher doses of flesinoxan. In contrast, NAN-190 produced additive antiemetic effects when combined with 8-OH-DPAT and little if any reduction. NAN-190 reduced the defensiveness produced by both flesinoxan and 8-OH-DPAT. Phentolamine and sulpiride reduced neither the antiemetic effect nor the defensive behavior produced by flesinoxan, thus ruling out a role for alpha-adrenoceptors and dopamine D2 receptors. Flesinoxan exerted a broad spectrum antiemetic effect by an action at 5-HT1A receptors as does 8-OH-DPAT, but differed in its response to putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonists.", 
    "16": "We reviewed the medical records of 11 consecutive patients who underwent trabeculectomy with anterior chamber washout and peripheral iridectomy as the primary surgical treatment for traumatic hyphema that was unresponsive to medical management. The mean intraocular pressure before surgery was 48 mm Hg. In ten of the patients the intraocular pressure was lowered to 21 mm Hg or lower after surgery and remained below that level up to the most recent follow-up visit, which ranged from eight to 97 months. One patient required a topical beta-blocker and oral acetazolamide to lower pressure to this level after surgery. Eight patients had visual acuity of 20/60 or better at last follow-up. Corneal blood staining occurred in eight patients. Compared with other techniques for surgical management of traumatic hyphema, trabeculectomy provides a means to keep intraocular pressure lowered while the remaining blood is clearing from the anterior chamber. Trabeculectomy with anterior chamber washout and peripheral iridectomy appears to be a safe and reliable procedure in the management of traumatic hyphemas in which medical management fails to control intraocular pressure.", 
    "17": "Long-term medical therapy and laser trabeculoplasty have been implicated as risk factors in the outcome of glaucoma filtration surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed of patients undergoing primary trabeculectomy during three key periods: before use of beta-blockers and laser trabeculoplasty (1975 and 1976), after introduction of beta-blocker therapy but before use of the laser (1980), and after common use of beta-blockers and laser (1985 and 1986). A total of 150 patients were included in the analysis. Eyes treated with laser trabeculoplasty at some time before filtration surgery had a decreased probability of successful filtration surgery (intraocular pressure less than 21 mm Hg, 75% vs 91% at one year, P = .05; 50% vs 86% at five years, P = .01). It is unknown whether laser was detrimental to subsequent filtration surgery or merely acted as a selection factor in identifying patients who would have less successful surgical outcomes. Preoperative use of topical medication did not influence the outcome of surgery. Patients having bilateral filtration surgery had similar outcomes between fellow eyes despite the longer use of therapy in the second eye (mean of 1.8 years between operations). In the subgroup of eyes with low preoperative intraocular pressures (less than 21 mm Hg), surgery was successful in reducing pressure to a lower level in 70% of eyes at one year (preoperative pressure, 17.8 mm; one-year postoperative pressure, 13.3 mm, P = .007).", 
    "18": "The stability of atenolol in an oral liquid stored for 40 days under various conditions was studied. A liquid preparation of atenolol 2 mg/mL was prepared by triturating 50-mg atenolol tablets with a commercially available oral diluent. Twelve 30-mL portions in vials were prepared. Three vials were refrigerated (5 degrees C) and shaken immediately before analysis, three were stored at room temperature (25 degrees C) and shaken, three were refrigerated and not shaken, and three were stored at room temperature and not shaken. One sample from each vial was assayed in duplicate on days 0, 15, 30, and 40 by stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of atenolol remained above 90% of the original concentration in each vial under each of the four sets of conditions. Microbial growth occurred in a few cultured samples, and pH changed minimally. Atenolol 2 mg/mL in an oral liquid was stable for up to 40 days when stored at 5 or 25 degrees C and shaken or at 5 or 25 degrees C and not shaken.", 
    "19": "It was analyzed whether the response to sotalol can predict the response to amiodarone as evaluated by programmed ventricular stimulation in 30 patients with coronary artery disease and documented recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed using 1 or 2 extrastimuli during sinus rhythm and 4 drive cycle lengths at 2 right ventricular sites. If no ventricular tachyarrhythmia was induced, a third extrastimulus was introduced during a paced cycle length of 500 ms. During the control study, VT (mean cycle length 305 +/- 63 ms) was induced in all patients, and the right ventricular effective refractory period (during S1-S1 = 500 ms) was 223 +/- 12 ms. After sotalol, sustained and nonsustained VT were inducible in 22 (73%) and 7 (23%) patients, respectively. One patient did not undergo stimulation on sotalol, because of side effects. After amiodarone, sustained and nonsustained VT were inducible in 23 (77%) and 7 (23%) patients, respectively. The mean cycle length of the induced VT was prolonged after both drugs by 17% (p < 0.001). The effective refractory period was prolonged by 15% (p < 0.001) after sotalol and by 13% (p < 0.001 compared with baseline study; p = NS between both drugs) after amiodarone. Thus, concordant results (effective or ineffective drug) between sotalol and amiodarone were found in 26 patients (87%).",

    "21": "Little is known about the ontogeny of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1B (5-HT1B) receptor, a putative terminal autoreceptor in the CNS. To learn more about the regional development of 5-HT1B sites and how early these sites may become functional, we studied [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP)-labelled central 5-HT1B sites in developing postnatal rat brain and spinal cord. Significant ontogenic changes in Bmax were found in neocortex, hippocampus, striatum and brainstem. Maximum binding-site density was reached by 21 days in hippocampus and cortex, but not until 28 days in striatum. The rank order of binding site density changed with rat age, but Bmax was consistently high in brainstem and low in cerebellum. The percent increases in Bmax also varied with brain region, ranging from a 2-fold increase in brainstem up to 8-fold increases in cortex and striatum. In competition studies, the Ki for 5-HT and for RU 24969 was the same in 5-day-old and adult rat brain. These data indicate regional differences in the ontogeny of 5-HT1B-binding sites and suggest that 5-HT1B receptors are functional early in the postnatal period.", 
    "22": "To study the effect of beta-receptor-blocking agents in an animal model of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, we measured LV performance in vivo and in vitro in 69 rats with or without metoprolol (M) treatment 3 wk after left coronary arterial ligation or sham operation. Rats were divided into six groups including control (C) and M noninfarct (C-N and M-N), C and M small infarct (C-S and M-S), and C and M large infarct (C-L and M-L). LV function was measured as slope of change in systolic vs. diastolic pressure (pressure-function curve) during pressor response after administration of a bolus of phenylephrine (5 micrograms/kg i.v.). Reduction of LV function was noted in C-L compared with C-N and C-S (slope of pressure-function curve 3.3 +/- 0.3 vs. 11.0 +/- 1.9 and 11.9 +/- 2.3, respectively) and in M-L compared with M-N and M-S rats (slope of 5.5 +/- 1.4 vs. 11.3 +/- 2.0 and 12.1 +/- 1.4, respectively). There was no significant difference between C and M rats, although there was a trend toward partial correction of the pressure-function curves in M-L compared with C-L rats. In muscle bath preparations the uninfarcted LV posterior papillary muscle from shams and rats with small infarcts showed a dose-related increase in peak rate of tension development with isoproterenol stimulation, but this response was lacking in both C-L and M-L.

    "23": "We investigated neurohumoral profiles and transmitter and neuroenzyme markers of cardiac autonomic innervation in control (unpaced) dogs and three groups of dogs with pacing-induced heart failure (paced, paced + beta-adrenergic blockade, and paced + cardiac denervation). Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased significantly and to a comparable extent in all paced groups. Pacing increased plasma norepinephrine (NE); increases in NE were not attenuated but instead tended to be exaggerated by treatment with propranolol or cardiac denervation. Atrial hypertrophy occurred in all paced groups compared with the control group. However, atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy were not as pronounced in the paced plus cardiac denervation group as in the paced and paced plus propranolol groups. Pacing also depleted neuropeptide Y and NE from all heart chambers; propranolol treatment did not modify these local tissue changes. Pacing caused selective depletion of neuroenzymes predominantly in the left ventricle; again, propranolol did little to modify these changes. In this study of paced animals with experimentally maintained cardiac dysfunction, failure to modify noradrenergic responses with intrapericardial cardiac denervation suggests that noncardiac sources contribute predominantly to high plasma NE. Failure to modify neurohumoral, neuropeptide, and neuroenzyme responses with beta-antagonist suggests this treatment has little practical direct influence on sympathetic vasomotor activity or neuronal function in heart failure.", 
    "24": "The effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on heart rate and on the chronotropic response induced by angiotensin II were evaluated. The action of angiotensin II, injected into the sinus node artery, on heart rate was determined in anaesthetized and vagotomized dogs pretreated with beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (n = 9), before and after the infusion of physiological and pharmacological doses (10 and 50 ng/kg per min) of ANP. ANP plasma concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Compared to the baseline concentration values (117 +/- 3 pg/ml), a slight increase was produced by the lower dose (293 +/- 45 pg/ml), whereas a significant augmentation was noted with the higher dose of ANP (1024 +/- 255 pg/ml). The basal heart rate and mean systemic arterial pressure were decreased (26.3 and 13.5%) during the intravenous infusion of the physiological dose of the peptide and were significantly reduced (32.5 and 29.2%, P < 0.05) by the administration of the pharmacological dose of ANP. Angiotensin II had a positive chronotropic effect (29 +/- 3 beats/min) that was significantly inhibited by the pharmacological dose of ANP. Our results suggest that ANP might have a role in the control of heart rate.", 
    "25": "A switch from treatment with diuretics and beta-blockers to treatment with the more expensive ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists has been noted in the hypertension field. The aim of this paper was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of this switch towards more expensive antihypertensive drugs in Sweden. The upper limit of the cost-effectiveness of ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists compared with diuretics and beta-blockers was estimated by assuming that ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists achieve the epidemiologically expected risk reduction for coronary heart disease. The incremental cost per life-year gained varies between approximately SEK 50,000 and approximately SEK 6,000,000 ($1 = SEK 6) in the different patient groups analysed. It is concluded that ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists may be potentially cost-effective in some patient groups at a high risk of coronary heart disease. Since an improved risk reduction has not been demonstrated in clinical trials, however, ACE-inhibitors and calcium-antagonists cannot at present be recommended for hypertension treatment in any patient groups unless treatment with diuretics and beta-blockers is contraindicated.",

    "27": "Drugs were determined by direct injection of plasma samples into a biocompatible extraction column. The column is based on particles with a biocompatible external surface and a hydrophobic internal surface. The pores of the particles are small enough to exclude the protein molecules; the drug molecules can penetrate the porous particle and are retained on the hydrophobic internal surface. Biocompatibility of the particles was obtained by reaction of the external surface with the human plasma protein alpha1-acid glycoprotein. The surface within the pores of the particles contains hydrophobic C8 or C18 groups. The biocompatible extraction column was used in a fully automated system for the determination of ibuprofen, naproxen, propranolol, carbamazepine and phenytoin in plasma. No pressure increase was observed during the analysis of several hundred plasma samples. Plasma concentrations of propranolol in the range 4.5-125 ng/ml were determined with a precision (R.S.D.) of 0.75-1.8%. Linear calibration graphs were observed for the five drugs, and correlation coefficients of 1.0000 were obtained for four of the five model compounds.", 
    "28": "In this study, we investigated the participation of adrenergic neurotransmission in angiotensin II- (ANGII)-induced water intake and urinary electrolyte excretion by means of injection of the alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and ANGII into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) in rats. Prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist) antagonized the water ingestion, Na+, K+ and urine excretion induced by ANGII, whereas yohimbine (an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist) enhanced the Na+, K+ and urine excretion induced by ANGII. Propranolol (a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker) antagonized the water ingestion and enhanced the Na+, and urine excretion induced by ANGII. Previous treatment with prazosin reduced the pressor responses to ANGII, whereas yohimbine had opposite effects. Previous injection of propranolol produced no effects in the pressor responses to ANGII.

Mucosal damage was assessed 30 min after intraluminal instillation of 40% (w/v) ethanol (EtOH). EtOH treatment resulted in an increase in mucosal damage when compared to saline treated control animals. Administration of each growth factor either by tail vein (i.v.; 0.2-1 nmol/kg) or via the left gastric artery (i.a.; 0.05-0.2 nmol/kg) resulted in a significant reduction in the extent of mucosal damage. The growth factors reduced EtOH-mediated damage in an equipotent manner. The reduction in the area hemorrhagic damage ranged from -25 to -35% from EtOH alone when the factors were administered i.a. and from -75 to -85% when delivered i.v. Gastric mucosal blood flow as assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was increased in a dose-dependent and equipotent manner by EGF and TGF alpha administered either by the i.v. or i.a. route. LDF changes were greater when EGF or TGF alpha were delivered via the i.a. route. NGF did not significantly increase blood flow regardless of the dose or route of delivery. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (0.75 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the increase in LDF in response to EGF or TGF alpha but did not affect the ability of these growth factors to reduce EtOH-mediated damage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We prepared the racemic 11C analogue by methylation with [11C]CH3I of the corresponding desmethyl compound using a microwave oven to accelerate the reaction. Several radioactive by-products (about 70% of the non-volatile radioactive products) were formed. After HPLC purification [11C]CGP 20712A with a specific activity of 35 TBq/mmol was dissolved in a propylene glycol-ethanol-saline mixture to prepare it for injection. The total preparation time was 35 min. The radiochemical yield was 5% (calculated from [11C]CH3I, not corrected for decay). The identity of [11C]CGP 20712A was proved by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Tissue distribution studies in male Wistar rats have been performed. At 20 min after injection of the radioligand (0.1 nmol) the DAR [differential absorption ratio = (counts per minute recovered/g tissue)/(counts per min injected/g body weight)] in heart tissue decreased significantly (P < 0.005) from 1.84 +/- 0.11 to 1.21 +/- 0.12 after blocking of beta-adrenoceptors with 500 micrograms (R,S)-propranolol.

If ambulatory ischemia is primarily due to physical activity, then alterations in the schedule of physical activity should be reflected in a corresponding alteration in the occurrence of ischemia. This study was designed to examine the relation between activity patterns and the frequency of ambulatory ischemic episodes and the effect of nadolol on these relations.", 
    "32": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of nadolol versus placebo was performed in 20 patients with stable coronary artery disease. At the end of each 2-week treatment phase, patients were hospitalized for 48 hours. In the hospital, there was a regular activity day (awaken and assume normal activities at 8:00 AM) and a delayed activity day (awaken at 8:00 AM, arise at 10:00 AM, and begin normal activity at noon). Ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed throughout the hospitalization. On the regular activity day, there was a morning increase in heart rate and in the number of ischemic episodes during therapy with placebo that began at 8:00 AM. In contrast, on the delayed activity day, there was a 4-hour phase shift of the increases in heart rate and the increase in ischemic episodes (ie, at noon) corresponding to the onset of physical activities. Therapy with nadolol caused a 50% reduction in the total number of ischemic episodes (129 versus 65, placebo versus nadolol; P < .02). During nadolol therapy, there was no discernible circadian peak in the number of ischemic episodes on either activity day. During placebo treatment, 87% of ischemic episodes were preceded by an increase in heart rate > or = 5 beats per minute. Although nadolol caused a significant reduction in the total number of episodes preceded by a heart rate increase compared with placebo (99 versus 38 episodes, P < .04), this therapy was associated with a significant increase in the number of episodes not associated with a heart rate increase (15 versus 21 episodes, P < .002).", 
    "33": "The morning increase in ambulatory ischemic episodes is due to physical activity patterns. The majority of ischemic episodes are preceded by a heart rate increase, and it is these episodes that are primarily responsible for the morning increase in ischemia. Therapy with nadolol caused a reduction in the total number of ischemic episodes solely by reducing those episodes preceded by a heart rate increase. In contrast, nadolol caused a significant increase in the number of ischemic episodes not associated with a heart rate increase, perhaps in part because it potentiated coronary vasoconstriction.", 
    "34": "Calcicludine (CaC) is a 60-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps. It is structurally homologous to the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor, to dendrotoxins, which block K+ channels, and to the protease inhibitor domain of the amyloid beta protein that accumulates in Alzheimer disease. Voltage-clamp experiments on a variety of excitable cells have shown that CaC specifically blocks most of the high-threshold Ca2+ channels (L-, N-, or P-type) in the 10-100 nM range. Particularly high densities of specific 125I-labeled CaC binding sites were found in the olfactory bulb, in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum oriens of CA3 field in the hippocampal formation, and in the granular layer of the cerebellum. 125I-labeled CaC binds with a high affinity (Kd = 15 pM) to a single class of noninteracting sites in rat olfactory bulb microsomes. The distribution of CaC binding sites in cerebella of three mutant mice (Weaver, Reeler, and Purkinje cell degeneration) clearly shows that the specific high-affinity labeling is associated with granule cells. Electrophysiological experiments on rat cerebellar granule neurons in primary culture have shown that CaC potently blocks the L-type component of the Ca2+ current (K0.5 = 0.2 nM). Then CaC, in the nanomolar range, appears to be a highly potent blocker of an L-subtype of neuronal Ca2+ channels.",

The median increases in the time to onset of moderate angina at the final exercise tolerance test (end point) compared with baseline were 1.08 and 0.53 minutes for betaxolol and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.002, betaxolol and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0.002, betaxolol vs placebo). The time to onset of 1 mm ST-segment depression increased significantly (p < 0.05) with betaxolol compared with placebo at all but 1 treatment time point (median increase [p = 0.001] 1.77 and 0.37 minutes, respectively, at end point). Duration of exercise also was increased significantly (p < 0.05) after the third week of treatment and at end point (median 0.62 and 0.50 minutes, respectively; p = 0.03). Generally comparable results were found within the diltiazem (n = 128) and nifedipine (n = 25) subgroups, although the nifedipine group was too small to detect statistically significant differences between betaxolol and placebo treatment. Resting systolic blood pressure, heart rate and the rate-pressure product, measured both when angina occurred and at the end of exercise, also were influenced significantly (p < 0.05) by the betaxolol addition. The only serious adverse effect associated with betaxolol treatment was syncope, seen in 2 patients.", 
    "36": "Epinephrine increases coronary blood flow but may not improve the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The objective of this study was to determine whether this balance can be improved by administering a relatively pure alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor, alone or in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocker. We measured coronary perfusion pressures during CPR and myocardial adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and lactate concentrations in biopsies obtained immediately after 10 minutes of CPR in six control dogs and in three groups of six dogs each given large doses of epinephrine, phenylephrine, or phenylephrine plus propranolol during CPR. Coronary perfusion pressure during CPR was higher in the three treated groups than in the control group, although differences were limited to the early portion of CPR in dogs given epinephrine or phenylephrine alone. Postresuscitation myocardial ATP concentration was significantly higher (29.5 +/- 3.0 vs 22.6 +/- 1.8 nmol/mg of protein, p < 0.05) and myocardial lactate concentration tended to be lower (52.8 +/- 13.6 vs 78.5 +/- 15.2 nmol/mg of protein) than in the control group in dogs given both phenylephrine and propranolol. In contrast, myocardial ATP concentration tended to be lower than in the control group in epinephrine-treated dogs, and myocardial lactate concentrations were higher than in the control group in dogs treated with either epinephrine (p < 0.05) or phenylephrine alone (p = 0.052). We conclude that the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during CPR can be improved by administering a combination of phenylephrine and propranolol, but not by administering large doses of epinephrine or phenylephrine alone.",

All exercise tests were positive except in one patient taking diltiazem. The exercise time to 0.1 mV ST change was 4.2 +/- 1.7 minutes with no therapy, 5.1 +/- 1.6 minutes with nitrates, 6.6 +/- 0.8 minutes with diltiazem, and 6.5 +/- 2.1 minutes with atenolol. The rate-pressure product at 0.1 mV ST change was 20.9 +/- 4.6 with no therapy and 21.2 +/- 5.7 and 22 +/- 4.6 with nitrates and diltiazem, respectively, but fell to 15 +/- 3.9 beats.min.-1 mm Hg 10(-3) after atenolol (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the number of anginal attacks or in nitroglycerin consumption per week. The heart rate at the onset of ST-segment change during the exercise test and during ambulatory ECG monitoring was significantly lower during atenolol than during diltiazem treatment. Both atenolol and diltiazem were of similar efficacy in increasing nonischemic exercise duration in patients with variable-threshold angina and acted primarily by slowing the resting heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, the slope of end-systolic wall stress-velocity of fiber shortening relation was much greater (251% of baseline) during dobutamine infusion, which also significantly decreased wall stress, and was much less (27% of baseline) after propranolol injection, which increased wall stress.", 
    "42": "The velocity of fiber shortening corrected for heart rate did change predictably with changes in contractility and as such can be used noninvasively in the temporal evaluation of individual patients undergoing therapeutic interventions or to define the natural history of a disease process. However, the relation on which it is based is not defined by parallel straight lines across contractile states, so that abnormal single point measurements may reflect only the nonlinearity of the relation rather than abnormalities in contractility. Thus, we recommend that the end-systolic wall stress-velocity of fiber shortening relation should not be used as a single-beat index of contractility.",

    "48": "We studied the degranulation reaction of electropermeabilized human neutrophils induced by 1,2-didecanoyl-3-sn-phosphatidic acid (PA10). PA10 dose-dependently induced the release of beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme of azurophil granules, but did not induce the release of lactoferrin, a protein of specific granules. The enzyme release by PA10 absolutely required Ca2+, ATP, and Mg2+ and the concentrations for the half-maximal response were 2.5 microM, 60 microM, and 0.25 mM, respectively. Although Ca2+ alone at concentrations higher than 10 microM induced the release of both beta-glucuronidase and lactoferrin, the extents of the release were far less than that of the beta-glucuronidase release by PA10. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol induced the release of lactoferrin alone at concentrations of Ca2+ below 0.5 microM while they induced the release of both beta-glucuronidase and lactoferrin at higher Ca2+ concentrations, indicating that the degranulation induced by PA10 is not mediated by diacylglycerol which might be formed from PA. The degranulation reactions induced by PA10 and PMA were dose-dependently inhibited by staurosporine and calphostin C, protein kinase C inhibitors, although no direct activation of protein kinase C by PA10 was observed. The extent of the beta-glucuronidase release by PA10 was not enhanced by the addition of PMA. Propranolol, which inhibits protein kinase C as well as phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, strongly inhibited the degranulation reactions induced by PA10 and PMA. Ethanol, a metabolic modulator of phospholipase D, and cyclic AMP did not affect the degranulation reactions by PMA and PA10.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Six trained men were studied to examine the relative increases in hepatic glucose output and peripheral glucose uptake during 40 min of exercise at 75% VO2max.

Plasma glucose increased (P < 0.05) from 4.8 +/- 0.2 mmol l-1 at rest to 6.2 +/- 0.5 mmol l-1 after 40 min of exercise. Both Ra and Rd increased (P < 0.05) during exercise, however, during the early phase of exercise, Ra exceeded Rd (P < 0.05). Ra peaked at 42.0 +/- 3.2 mumol kg-1 min-1 after approximately 15 min of exercise. In contrast, the highest Rd of 33.9 +/- 4.3 mumol kg-1 min-1 was measured at the end of exercise. In additional experiments, five men were studied during 40 min of exercise at 70-75% VO2max, 2 h after ingestion of the non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol or a placebo capsule.

RBF was also monitored during 30 min intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusions of Ang II at 2 pmol kg-1 min-1. The i.c. infusions of Ang II induced about 50 mmHg rise in cBP. A steep decline occurred during 5 min post-infusion, followed by a much slower reduction with the cBP remaining above control level at 40 min post-infusion. The pressure elevation induced by i.v. Ang II was less pronounced but exhibited a similar pattern. Labetalol significantly reduced the pressor response to i.c. as well as i.v. Ang II. The i.c. and i.v. infusions of Ang II conspicuously reduced the RBF regardless of whether the ewes were labetalol-treated or not. At 5 min after the infusions RBF had returned to control level. The ICV infusions did not influence the RBF. Ang II i.c. elicited thirst in 50% of the ewes with the urge to drink remaining at 40 min post-infusion. The dipsogenic response was not reduced by labetalol pretreatment. The results imply that no cerebral component contributes to the reduction in RBF induced by systemic Ang II. However, a centrally mediated action seems to be the cause of the long-lasting post-infusion cBP elevation and dipsogenic response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "It has been shown that stress or disease-induced increases in plasma corticosterone result in diminished testosterone secretion from the testes. This article reviews investigations from our laboratories that explore the role of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-OHSD) in this process. It is proposed that the level of 11 beta-OHSD in Leydig cells dictates the level of intracellular glucocorticoid available to the glucocorticoid receptor and thus the potency of corticosteroid as an inhibitor of testosterone secretion. Stressed and unstressed rats were housed under simulated natural conditions in a Visible Burrow System. Stressed animals showed elevated plasma corticosteroid, lowered plasma testosterone, and diminished testicular 11 beta-OHSD, Immunocytochemical analysis showed that only Leydig cells of the rat testis contain 11 beta-OHSD and glucocorticoid receptors. Half-maximal inhibition of testosterone by Leydig cells required 1.5 nM dexamethasone or 0.4 microM corticosterone. Glycyrrhetinic acid, an inhibitor of 11 beta-OHSD, increased the potency of corticosterone, but did not affect dexamethasone based inhibition. The glucocorticoid receptor blocker, RU 486, prevented inhibition by both corticosterone and dexamethasone. Other classes of steroid were not inhibitors of testosterone biosynthesis. Thus, 11 beta-OHSD oxidizes corticosterone to the inactive metabolite 11-dehydrocorticosterone, relieving steroid-dependent inhibition of Leydig cell function. Lowered enzyme activity increases glucocorticoid dependent inhibition of testosterone production. We conclude that the evidence supports a role of 11 beta-OHSD in testosterone secretion by the testes.", 
    "52": "Radioreceptor binding studies were designed to localize and determine the number of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the mammary gland of lactating cows. 3H-prazosin, 3H-rauwolscine and 3H-dihydroalprenolol were used for the regional characterization of alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors by competitive inhibition of binding of 3H-ligands with unlabelled adrenergic agonists and antagonists. The alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes could thus be demonstrated in the regions of the teats, large mammary ducts and parenchyma. Tissues of the teat wall, of the large mammary ducts above the gland cistern and of the mammary parenchyma were prepared to determine the density of alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-receptors by saturation binding assays using 3H-prazosin, 3H-rauwolscine and 3H-dihydroalprenolol respectively. Binding to high affinity sites was reversible within minutes and saturable. Equilibrium was reached within minutes. The number of alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors decreased from the teat to the mammary ducts to the parenchyma. Most of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors were found in the teat wall, whereas in the parenchyma alpha-adrenergic receptors were absent or barely detectable. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors was similar in the teat wall and the large mammary ducts, but much lower in the parenchyma. Thus, alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic receptors were found mainly in the milk purging system and hardly at all in mammary parenchyma. Inhibition of milk removal by alpha-adrenergic stimulation is possibly due to constriction of teat wall and to constriction of the mammary ducts, whereas enhanced milk flow after beta-adrenergic stimulation is possibly due to relaxation not only of the teat sphincter and teat wall, but probably also of the large mammary ducts.", 
    "53": "A new model using isolated rabbit hearts perfused at constant flow in the Langendorff mode with the sinus node destroyed and under constant (2 Hz) pacing is described. Ventricular ischemia (24 min) was induced by ligation of the left ventricular branch of the coronary artery (LVB), followed by reperfusion (15 min). The programmed electrical stimulation (PES) technique was used to induce arrhythmias in the ischemic zone (IZ). Three agents with different mechanisms of action were tested to validate this model: dl-sotalol (10(-6) and 10(-5) M), oxfenicine (10(-6) M), and lidocaine (10(-5) M). These compounds were administered 15 min before the ligature and maintained until the end of the experiment. Ventricular effective refractory period (VERP), PES-induced ventricular fibrillation (VF), and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) were monitored. PES-induced VF was only observed in ischemic tissue. Sotalol slightly reduced VF incidence only during reperfusion. Oxfenicine prevented PES-induced VF during the ischemia, but not during reperfusion, while lidocaine prevented VF during ischemia and throughout the reperfusion period. In conclusion, the rabbit heart model where PES is applied to normal and ischemic myocardium, appears useful to discern different mechanisms involved in ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, this model is considerably cheaper than equivalent dog models.",

    "59": "Rectal temperature and oxygen consumption (Vo2) were monitored in female rats acclimated either to cold or to thermoneutrality and with and without chronic administration of oestradiol. The hormone is known to inactivate brown adipose tissue (BAT) and to reduce its response to noradrenaline (NA). The role of sympathetic control was studied by administering NA or the adrenergic blocker propranolol. Oestradiol treatment did not affect rectal temperature in the states of acclimation to thermoneutrality and to cold, nor did it change the hypothermic response of cold-exposed rats to temporary food deprivation. In the cold-acclimated rats, both controls and oestradiol-treated animals exhibited similar degrees of metabolic reduction after propranolol administration in the cold and similar degrees of metabolic activation by NA at thermoneutrality. Rats acclimated to thermoneutrality showed a larger metabolic response to NA when treated with oestradiol. The results suggest that oestradiol, while inactivating the BAT response to NA, activates the NA responsiveness of other metabolically active tissues in cold-induced thermogenesis. The observation of a greater oxidative capacity in the kidney and the rectus abdominis muscle of oestradiol-treated, cold-acclimated rats would be in line with this proposal.",

After a 4-week placebo period, 240 white patients with a mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure of > or = 90 mm Hg were randomized to receive either placebo, nebivolol (1, 5, or 10 mg), hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 or 25 mg), or one of the six possible combinations of nebivolol and hydrochlorothiazide for 12 weeks. A dose-related reduction in clinic and ambulatory blood pressure was demonstrated for each drug as monotherapy and for the two drugs in combination. Nebivolol, 5- and 10-mg doses, showed a larger effect than hydrochlorothiazide doses on clinic blood pressure and over the 24-h interval. Moreover, the combination doses had substantial antihypertensive effects that were sustained over the entire 24-h profile with a greater effect observed with the higher dose combinations. The reduction in ambulatory blood pressure was further substantiated by the reduction of blood pressure loads (% of BP > 140/90 mm Hg awake and > 120/80 mm Hg asleep) to as low as 11.5% with 10 mg of nebivolol combined with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Nebivolol and hydrochlorothiazide were well tolerated. We provided evidence that nebivolol, given as monotherapy or in combination with low dose of hydrochlorothiazide, is effective in reducing clinic and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure in patients with ambulatory hypertension. The results provided further evidence for the use of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and factorial designs when investigating new antihypertensive agents.", 
    "62": "The goals of this study were 1) to examine changes in lung liquid formation and composition during spontaneous labor in fetal lambs and 2) to determine the importance of beta-adrenergic stimulation and transepithelial Na+ flux in removing liquid from the lung lumen near birth. We measured net production of lung liquid (Jv), lung liquid composition, and transpulmonary electrical potential difference (PD) before and during labor in fetal sheep with chronically implanted tracheal and vascular catheters. We determined Jv by measuring rate of change in lung liquid concentration of 125I-albumin, an impermeant tracer that was mixed in lung liquid at the start of each study. In 17 paired experiments, Jv decreased from 11 +/- 2 ml/h (Jv > 0 = secretion) before labor to -1 +/- 2 ml/h (Jv < 0 = absorption) during labor; in 5 paired experiments, PD changed from -7 +/- 1 mV (lumen negative) before labor to -12 +/- 1 mV during labor. To determine whether absorption of lung liquid during labor is the result of beta-adrenergic stimulation, we studied the effect of propranolol on Jv during labor. When propranolol (40 microM) was added to lung liquid during active labor, Jv decreased from -2 +/- 2 to -8 +/- 3 ml/h (n = 9). Thus, propranolol did not inhibit lung liquid absorption during labor. To determine whether transepithelial Na+ movement provides the driving force for lung liquid clearance during labor, we tested the effects of amiloride, an Na+ transport inhibitor, on Jv and PD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Osteopetrosis is commonly associated with short stature. To identify the cause, 8 children with osteopetrosis and short stature were studied. One showed evidence of renal tubular acidosis, none showed evidence of anaemia, and all were clinically and biochemically euthyroid. Growth hormone profile was assessed using night sampling (8 patients), growth hormone provocative testing using insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (6 patients), and L-dopa-propranolol (8 patients). The mean nocturnal growth hormone values taken at 60 and 90 min after onset of sleep and at 4 a.m. were 5.5, 12.8, and 11.5 mu/L respectively. The peak stimulated growth hormone mean values with the insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (glucose 1.6-3.0 mmol/L, mean = 2.2) was 14 mu/L (range 7.3-24.5 mu/L) and with the L-dopa-propranolol was 25.6 mu/L (range 12.3-49 mu/L). IGF1 levels taken at 0 and 120 min of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (0 min for L-dopa-propranolol), and at 120 min of L-dopa-propranolol, showed normal values for age. We conclude that: (1) growth hormone profiles in these children are normal; (2) tissue unresponsiveness to growth hormone and/or IGF1 is not likely to be the cause of short stature in children with osteopetrosis; and (3) osteopetrosis per se is not an indication for assessment of growth hormone status.", 
    "64": "Some physiological functions of the heart are modulated through cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. In acute myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias occur frequently and class I antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine are often administered continuously over long period. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term treatment with lidocaine on cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. Ventricular cardiocytes from 2-day-old Wistar rat were cultured in the presence or absence of lidocaine, and beta-adrenoceptors of the membrane fraction of the cells were measured with a binding assay using [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) as a radioligand. When the cells were cultured in the presence of lidocaine at clinical or toxic concentrations, the binding of [125I]CYP to the cells increased in a concentration (10(-5) mol/l-10(-3) mol/l)--and time (12-72 h)--dependent manner. The effect was due to an increase in maximum binding and was not due to a change in the dissociation constant for the ligand. The stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in the cell membrane by 1 mumol/l isoproterenol increased in lidocaine-treated cells. The increased number of receptors returned to the control level when the cells were cultured without lidocaine for a further 24 h. These results indicate that lidocaine up-regulates cardiac beta-adrenoceptors at both clinical or toxic doses during the period of treatment. Other antiarrhythmic drugs such as disopyramide (Ia), mexiletine (Ib) and flecainide (Ic) also increased the number of beta-receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A nondegradable matrix formulation of sotalol made with polyurethane was studied by use of short-term treatment model with dogs, and the electrophysiologic effects were compared with those resulting from an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight. Epicardial sotalol-polyurethane matrices were also used in 7-day canine implant studies. A sotalol-silicone rubber matrix was used in 60-day epicardial canine implant studies. A biodegradable poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microsphere formulation of sotalol was also studied as a pericardial injection in another series involving 30-day dog experiments. The short-term treatment electrophysiologic effects observed with the epicardial (left ventricular) implantation of a sotalol-polyurethane matrix formulation were comparable to those observed with intravenous sotalol. However, the total dose delivered by the matrix over a 2-h experimental period was 25 times smaller than the intravenous dose (0.077 versus 2 mg/kg). Furthermore, coronary venous sotalol levels after sotalol-polyurethane matrix implantation were in the therapeutic range (1812.4 +/- 415.1 ng/mL), whereas simultaneous peripheral venous levels were more than 1 order of magnitude lower (149.8 +/- 14.1 ng/mL). An intravenous bolus administration of sotalol (2 mg/kg) resulted in coronary venous levels (1537.1 +/- 44.6 ng/mL) that were very close to simultaneous peripheral venous levels (1428.6 +/- 63.9 ng/mL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

However, LV volumes derived from summated serial short axis slices require long imaging times and make it difficult to record LV volumes in response to acute alterations in load. In this study, geometry-based LV end-systolic volume estimates calculated from a single long-axis image (Area-Length formula) and from a long-axis and short-axis image (Bullet formula) were compared to those derived from summated short-axis images of the left ventricle (Simpson's rule) during altered loading conditions in six anesthetized, intact dogs.",

Group I consisted of eight neonates in whom VIP was administered after bilateral vagotomy and beta-blockade with propranolol. Group II consisted of five neonates studied after vagotomy and propranolol, plus total chemical sympathectomy (6-hydroxydopamine). In both groups, VIP resulted in a significant shortening of sinus cycle length. AV nodal conduction time, measured as the AH interval (the time from the onset of the atrial electrogram to the onset of the His bundle electrogram in the His electrode catheter) during atrial pacing, also shortened after VIP. His-Purkinje conduction time and atrial effective refractory periods were unchanged by VIP. In other experiments, the direct chronotropic effect of VIP was evaluated in five isolated neonatal canine hearts using a modified Langendorff technique. In these hearts, the spontaneous cycle length decreased from 403 +/- 88 to 293 +/- 69 ms, or -28 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD), after exposure to 0.1-0.5 nmol of VIP (p < 0.001). In nine other newborns (aged 4-16 days), the effect of selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blockade on the positive chronotropic effect of VIP was evaluated. The effect of VIP on sinus cycle length was not altered by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker prazosin or by the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor blocker yohimbine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "We have evaluated putative predictors of the progression in diabetic nephropathy during long-term antihypertensive treatment. Twenty hypertensive insulin-dependent diabetic patients with nephropathy were followed for three (2 to 5) years before, and for three years during antihypertensive treatment with metoprolol and furosemide. Fall rate in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 9.5 +/- 3.8 ml/min/year (mean +/- SD) before and 3.6 +/- 3.6 during antihypertensive treatment. Albuminuria was 1442 (150 to 7564) micrograms/min (median range) in the last year before and 880 (96 to 3310) micrograms/min in the first year during treatment. Relative change in adjusted albumin excretion (ratio of values obtained during first year of treatment/and last year before) was significantly correlated to fall rate in GFR during the three years of treatment (r = 0.46, P < 0.05) and to relative change in fall rate in GFR (fall rate during and before treatment were compared) (r = 0.47, P < 0.05). No significant correlations were found between fall rate in GFR during the three years of treatment and arterial blood pressure, albuminuria or GFR measured the last year before, the first year during treatment or the relative changes in these three variables (after-before). In conclusion, a decrease in fractional albumin excretion during conventional antihypertensive treatment predicts an attenuated fall rate in GFR in diabetic nephropathy. The finding suggests a clinical application in monitoring the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in diabetic nephropathy.",

The etiology of this behavior is hypothesized as secondary to a state of overarousal. beta blockers are believed to be uniquely useful medications in having an effect on self-injurious behaviors through their ability to reduce arousal in the face of stimulation and demands. The case presented describes a multiply handicapped adolescent with severe self-injury who responded to 300 mg of propranolol with a gradual but steady reduction in self-injury over 12 months.

    "73": "The acute hemodynamic effects of nisoldipine (Bay K552) in patients with essential hypertension were studied using nuclear ventriculography. In a cohort of 16 essential hypertension patients, an oral dose of 15 mg nisoldipine significantly lowered blood pressure within 20 min. The effect lasted at least 3 h. Blood pressure that was 160.5 +/- 20.3/108.0 +/- 10.1 mm Hg initially was reduced to 137.0 +/- 14.9/93.8 +/- 9.4 mm Hg at 3 h (P < 0.001). Cardiac output rose, total peripheral resistance fell and ejection fraction rose significantly. End systolic and end diastolic volumes did not change significantly with this dose of nisoldipine. The acute hemodynamic effects of 15 mg nisoldipine administered orally, measured by repeat nuclear ventriculography, were maintained during therapy for the 8 weeks of observation. Thus, nisoldipine is a powerful antihypertensive agent, significantly decreasing BP as well as total peripheral resistance and increasing cardiac index. This effect was prominent after 3 h and wore off about 12 h after each dose. Five of the patients had an initially high heart rate. To these patients propranolol was added in small doses (20-40 mg/day, mean 25 +/- 26 mg/day). This addition did not change the results when the patients were analyzed separately.",

Whereas ACh depresses cardiac function, recent data indicate that VIP may have a cardiostimulatory effect. Exogenously administered VIP appears to enhance left ventricular (LV) contractile function; however, whether endogenously released VIP alters LV performance is not known. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of exogenous VIP and endogenously released VIP during vagal stimulation after muscarinic and beta-adrenergic blockade (VS-B) on LV performance using pressure-volume analysis. Eight anesthetized open-chest dogs instrumented to measure LV pressure and volume (conductance catheter) were pretreated with atropine (0.1 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg). The cervical vagi were transected. Hemodynamic data were obtained at steady state and during transient vena caval occlusion. Exogenous intravenous VIP (0.05 microgram/kg-1 x min-1) increased HR minimally [2.1 +/- 0.9% increase; P = not significant (NS)] but significantly increased maximum first time derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dtmax; 29.4 +/- 19.9% increase; P < 0.05) and the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (Ees; 3.1 +/- 1.3 to 8.9 +/- 4.2 mmHg/ml; P < 0.05).

Decreasing [Na+]e from 150 to 120 mM in the vein increased MT by 24%, and raising [Na+]e to 165 mM attenuated it by 30%. In pressurized posterior cerebral arteries, decreasing [Na+]e to 120 mM reduced the intraluminal diameter by 12%, whereas increasing [Na+]e to 165 mM increased it by 17%. MT was inhibited by amiloride [50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 17 +/- 6 microM], an inhibitor of Na(+)-H+ exchange. Diisothiocyanatostilbene sulfonic acid, a Na(+)-Cl(-)-HCO3- cotransporter blocker, inhibited MT with an IC50 of 4.4 +/- 0.65 microM. Ouabain increased MT [50% effective concentration (EC50) = 0.10 +/- 0.04 microM] as did the reintroduction of HCO3- (EC50 5.0 +/- 1.5 mM). Our study suggests that MT in the rabbit posterior cerebral artery and rabbit facial vein is modulated by changes in [Na+]e. This effect is independent of the method used to register changes in wall force. The sensitivity of the tone to changes in [Na+]e and the independence of vessel diameter at different pressures at various [Na+]e may reflect changes in the sensitivity of smooth muscle stretch or mechanoreceptors to [Na+]e.",

Blockade of alpha-adrenergic receptors with phentolamine abolished the pressor effect of TRH in control rats (+2.1 +/- 1.9 mmHg) but did not attenuate the blood pressure response of medullectomized rats (+21.5 +/- 4.7 mmHg). In contrast, beta-blockade with propranolol blunted the blood pressure responsiveness of rats subjected to adrenal medullectomy (+12.4 +/- 2.6 mmHg) but did not modify the effect of TRH in sham-operated controls (+10.9 +/- 2.9 mmHg). 4. The direct in vitro effect of TRH on isolated mesenteric rat arteries was also evaluated. TRH did not induce contractions of isolated arteries. 5. These results suggest that in rats with intact adrenals, the pressor effect of intravenous TRH is mediated primarily by a stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. Adrenal medullectomy appears to enhance the blood pressure response to intravenous TRH. Activation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors seems to contribute to the blood pressure increasing effect of intravenous TRH in medullectomized animals.",

Single-pulse stimulation of the LC and the VLM, respectively, inhibited 50% and 54% of 30 sleep-active neurons and excited 47% and 67% of 34 waking-active neurons. The remaining neurons were mostly unaffected. Seventy-three neurons that were not related to a sleep-wake state were mostly (i.e., 73-80%) unresponsive to stimulation. The high incidence of responses by sleep-related neurons suggests that neural inputs from the LC and VLM regulate the hypnogenic mechanisms in the POA. Stimulation of the LC antidromically activated 15% of sleep-active neurons and 11% of waking-active neurons. Thus, some of the sleep-related neurons in the POA may regulate LC neurons. In a later stage of the experiment, we used isoflurane-anesthetized rats that had been used for recording sleep-related neurons. Antagonists for adrenoceptors at a concentration of 10 microM were applied to neurons through a multibarrel micropipette to examine the involvement of noradrenaline in the responses as a neurotransmitter. Application of the alpha 2-blocker, yohimbine, attenuated the inhibitory responses in all 7 neurons tested. The beta-blocker, timolol, and the alpha 1-blocker, prazosin, did not alter any of the inhibitory responses. On the other hand, timolol attenuated the excitatory responses in 4 of 7 neurons, and prazosin attenuated the excitatory responses in 5 of 12 neurons. Yohimbine did not affect the excitatory responses. Thus, the LC and the VLM probably inhibit sleep-active neurons through alpha 2-adrenoceptors and excite waking-active neurons through either beta- or alpha 1-adrenoceptors.",

The linearity of the calibration curves was satisfactory (r = 0.9998) and the precision (RSD%) better than 1.89. Detection limits were 0.50 and 0.44 micrograms ml-1 for pindolol and clopamide, respectively. No spectral interferences from tablet excipients were found. Applications are given for the assay of commercial tablets and content uniformity test. The procedures proved to be suitable for rapid and reliable quality control.", 
    "101": "The therapeutic approach to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) still remains nonspecific and symptomatic, since no specific etiology is identified. Nevertheless, the recent introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers greatly improved the treatment of DCM. The poor prognosis of patients with DCM encourages maximal aggressive attempts to prevent progression of ventricular dysfunction rather than to wait for treatable symptoms. To achieve this goal, vasodilators, particularly ACE inhibitors, now appear to be essential for the treatment of DCM. Digitalis is added unless contraindicated by adverse effects. Diuretics should be used only to relieve congestive symptoms. In the presence of sinus tachycardia or ventricular arrhythmias, beta-blockers are the next choice in our practice. When congestive symptoms or low output state are not controlled with vasodilators, diuretics, and digitalis, inotropic agents are indicated, with or without mechanical assist devices. For severely ill patients unresponsive to maximal medical management, heart transplantation is needed.", 
    "102": "ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors are revolutionizing the management of heart failure and are now earning themselves a place in the early treatment of post myocardial infarction (MI) patients who have evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or, more modestly, evidence of infarct expansion. The aims of ACE inhibitor therapy are to control symptoms, if any, and to improve prognosis. For these indications, they are impressive. Nonetheless, they are not a panacea. Post MI patients face a variety of threats, not least from progression of their underlying ischemic disease, and they should not be denied prognostically advantageous interventions, such as beta-blockers and aspirin. Moreover, ACE inhibitor monotherapy may not be the best management for heart failure itself. The role of other additive agents should not be dismissed.",

Behavioral symptoms frequently present the greatest challenge for caregivers and are often the determining factor in institutional placement. Determining the need for pharmacologic treatment of an agitated patient requires considering the full range of biopsychosocial variables and ultimately involves assessing the risks and benefits of the medications selected for the patient. In this article, the phenomenology of agitation is reviewed along with the pharmacologic treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, including the use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, serotonergic agents, carbamazepine, and lithium.",

The spectroscopic characteristics and electrophoresis migration parameters of diuretics, narcotics-analgesics and beta-blockers were established. Analytical figures of merit including parameters on the precision of migration and limits of detection are discussed. Results for the separation of drugs of different doping families are discussed. An analysis of urine from a patient receiving daily doses of atenolol is presented.", 
    "105": "The effects of various beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, with different pharmacological properties, on systemic and portal vein blood pressure and on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage were examined in surgically-induced portal hypertensive rats. Propranolol (5, 10 or 20 mg kg-1), nadolol (5 or 10 mg kg-1), metoprolol (10 or 20 mg kg-1), labetalol (20 or 40 mg kg-1) and pindolol (3 or 6 mg kg-1) reduced systemic blood pressure to a similar degree in both portal vein-ligated and sham-operated rats. All beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, except for pindolol, significantly reduced portal venous pressure and ethanol-induced macroscopic gastric mucosal damage in portal hypertensive animals. Sham-operated rats had lower portal venous pressure and less gastric damage compared with portal hypertensive rats, but both were unaffected by beta-adrenoceptor antagonist pretreatment. We conclude that: propranolol, nadolol, metoprolol and labetalol are effective in reducing the portal venous pressure and ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in portal hypertensive rats, but not in portal normotensive animals; there was no direct relationship between the reduction of portal vein and systemic blood pressure; and local anaesthetic action is probably important in reducing the portal vein pressure and ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions, while the intrinsic sympathomimetic effect can counteract the actions of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on portal venous pressure and gastric mucosa.", 
    "106": "1 beta 2-Adrenoceptor agonists may exacerbate asthma by reducing the release of the anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory molecule, heparin from mast cells in the airway. In this study, the direct effects of the clinically used bronchodilator, salbutamol, on the proliferation of airway smooth muscle cells grown in culture and stimulated with a range of mitogens have been examined. 2 In mitogen-stimulated cells, salbutamol (0.1-100 nM) inhibited [3H]-thymidine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner. Salbutamol (100 nM) pretreatment reduced the mitogenic responses to thrombin (0.3 u ml-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (300 pM) and U46619 (100 nM) by 61.7 +/- 6.1%, 46.9 +/- 13.9% and 57.6 +/- 12.7%, respectively. However, salbutamol pretreatment did not appear to reduce the small mitogenic response to endothelin-1. 3 Increases in [3H]-leucine incorporation in thrombin (0.3 u ml-1)-stimulated cells were reduced by salbutamol (100 nM) by 27.7 +/- 2.8%. Similarly, thrombin (0.3 u ml-1)-stimulated increases in cell number were also inhibited by salbutamol (100 nM) pretreatment. Thus, the effect of salbutamol in decreasing thrombin-induced [3H]-leucine incorporation may, at least in part, be explained by inhibition of cell proliferation. 4 The inhibition of cell proliferation by salbutamol was prevented by pretreatment with either the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (0.3 microM) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 (50 nM). 5. These results indicate that salbutamol, through activation of a beta 2-adrenoceptor, has a direct inhibitory effect on proliferation elicited by the mitogens thrombin, EGF, and U46619. Thus, it seems likely that this direct inhibitory action of Beta2-adrenoceptor agonists would override any indirect action to accelerate airway smooth muscle proliferation. These observations lead us to suggest that Beta2-adrenoceptor agonists exacerbate asthma by mechanisms unrelated to airway smooth muscle proliferation.", 
    "107": "1. Regional haemodynamic responses to the homologous peptides, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (1-27) (PACAP27) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were assessed by giving 20 min infusions (1.5-15 nmol kg-1 h-1) in conscious, chronically-instrumented, Long Evans rats. 2. PACAP27 caused dose-dependent depressor and tachycardic effects associated with renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilatations, although only in the latter vascular bed was there a sustained increase in flow. 3. VIP caused dose-dependent depressor and tachycardic effects that were not significantly different from those caused by equimolar doses of PACAP27. However, the hindquarters vasodilator effects of VIP (at 7.5 and 15 nmol kg-1 h-1) were greater than those of PACAP27 (at the same doses), and accompanied by reductions in renal and mesenteric flows and conductances. 4. In the presence of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 11 mumol kg-1 h-1), there was significant inhibition of the hindquarters vasodilator effects of PACAP27 and VIP (at 7.5 and 15 nmol kg-1 h-1). Under these circumstances the renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of VIP were abolished. 5. The beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 (670 nmol kg-1 bolus, 335 nmol kg-1 h-1 infusion), reduced the matched hindquarters vasodilator responses to PACAP27 (15 nmol kg-1 h-1) and VIP (7.5 nmol kg-1 h-1), and also abolished the renal vasoconstrictor effects of VIP. 6. The AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan potassium (20 mumol kg-1), had no significant effect on the haemodynamic response to PACAP27 (15 nmol kg-1 h-1), but augmented the hypotensive action of VIP (7.5 nmol kg-1 h-1). This influence of losartan was associated with conversion of the renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictor effect of VIP to vasodilatation. 7. Our findings show that similar changes in mean systemic arterial blood pressure in response to PACAP27 and VIP conceal substantial differences in their regional haemodynamic actions. Although the hindquarters vasodilator effects of both peptides involve NO- and Beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms,it appears that activation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes significantly to the haemodynamic effects of VIP, but not to those of PACAP27.", 
    "108": "1. Inflammatory diseases of the pancreas or diseases which cause obstruction within the biliary or within the biliary or pancreatic duct system are associated with severe pain. Although neuropeptides such as substance P are present in the biliary tree, only few capsaicin-sensitive, substance P-positive nerve fibres have been found in the ducts. In order to obtain functional evidence whether capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurones transmit nociceptive information arising from the biliopancreatic duct, blood pressure reflexes following electrical stimulation of the duct or increases in intraductal pressure were determined in barbiturate-anaesthetized rats. 2. Electrical stimulation of neurones in the biliopancreatic duct was carried out at 30 V, 3 ms, 50 Hz for 20s. In untreated animals the electrical stimulation resulted in rises in blood pressure by up to 25 mmHg, but in about a quarter of all animals tested this response was absent. Following the administration of phentolamine (7 mumol kg-1, i.p.) the blood pressure responses were changed to pronounced and reproducible depressor reflexes of -5 to -30 mmHg. Retrograde injections into the biliopancreatic duct of 300 microliters of a 154 mM sodium chloride solution produced increases in intraductal pressure of approximately 10 mmHg. This elicited shortlasting falls in blood pressure of 3-15 mmHg. Phentolamine significantly augmented the fall in blood pressure to 8-30 mmHg. 3. The depressor reflexes observed in both models after the administration of phentolamine were abolished by morphine (1 mumol kg-1, i.v.). The inhibition by morphine was reversed by naloxone (3 mumol kg-1, i.v.). Naloxone given before morphine did not affect the depressor reflex but prevented the inhibitory action of subsequently injected morphine.4. Acute s.c. injection of capsaicin (30 mg kg-1) abolished the depressor reflexes in response to both types of nociceptive stimulation in phentolamine-treated rats. The initial pressor effects of electrical stimulation were only partly inhibited by capsaicin whereas the basal depressor reflexes in response to elevation of intraductal pressure were abolished. In rats which had received capsaicin on the day before the experiment or had been treated with capsaicin as neonates, only minor rises in blood pressure were induced by electrical stimulation at the beginning of the experiment and no changes in blood pressure occurred after the administration of phentolamine. After adult or neonatal pretreatment with capsaicin the depressor reflexes in response to increased intraductal pressure were only small and were unchanged by phentolamine.5. The depressor reflexes following either electrical stimulation or increases in intraductal pressure were abolished by the unselective Beta-blocker, (-)-propranolol (3 micromol kg-1, i.p.), and greatly reduced by the Beta 1-blocker, metoprolol (6 micromol kg- 1, i.p.). The Beta2-preferring adrenoceptor antagonist, butoxamine(3 micromol kg-1, i.p.), had no effect on the depressor responses. The reflex falls in blood pressure were also abolished by hexamethonium (10 micromol kg-1, i.p.) but not by atropine (3 micromol kg-1, i.p.).6. Both models of stimulation of nociceptive afferents caused identical patterns of blood pressure responses following adrenalectomy or chemical sympathectomy. In adrenalectomized rats, the initial responses consisted of depressor reflexes which were not augmented but significantly reduced by phentolamine and further inhibited by metoprolol. In rats that had been pretreated with 6-hydroxydopamine(total dose 0.6 mmol kg-1) to accomplish chemical sympathectomy, nociceptive stimulation caused rises in blood pressure. Phentolamine treatment abolished these pressor effects but revealed only minor, if any, depressor responses that were unaffected by metoprolol.7. In summary, the hypotensive effects in both models constitute nociceptive reflexes since they are abolished by morphine and restored by naloxone. The afferent part of the reflex is mediated by nerve fibres sensitive to capsaicin. Both experimental procedures seem to elicit two, presumably separate, reflex mechanisms. Firstly, catecholamines released from the adrenal medulla elevate blood pressure or limit hypotensive responses via activation of vascular alpha receptors. Secondly, the reflex inhibition of the sympathetic nerve activity in the heart and the vasculature causes the nociceptive depressor reflexes.", 
    "109": "1. We have studied the alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes mediating inotropic effects of adrenaline in rat right ventricle and the Ca2+ sources used to elicit these effects. alpha 1A-Adrenoceptor-mediated contractile effects in rat vas deferens were studied for comparison in some cases. 2. Treatment with chloroethylclonidine did not affect the maximal beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic effects in rat right ventricle or the maximal alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile effects in rat vas deferens; it did not alter the potency of isoprenaline in the ventricle and reduced the potency of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists in vas deferens only slightly. Treatment of right ventricular strips with CdCl2 markedly reduced resting tension and enhanced maximal inotropic effects of isoprenaline but did not affect its potency. 3. Inactivation of cardiac alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by treatment with chloroethylclonidine slightly enhanced the maximal inotropic effects of the full agonist, adrenaline and of several partial agonists. 4. Schild analysis of inhibition experiments with the alpha 1A-adrenoceptor-selective antagonists, 5-methyl-urapidil and (+/-)-tamsulosin, demonstrated that adrenaline causes its inotropic effects mainly via the alpha 1B-adrenoceptor subtype. Schild analysis of 5-methyl-urapidil inhibition experiments in chloroethylclonidine-treated ventricles indicated that only alpha 1A-adrenoceptors mediate the inotropic effects of adrenaline following inactivation of the alpha 1B-adrenoceptors. 5. In control ventricles the organic Ca2+ entry blocker, nitrendipine and treatment with the inorganic Ca2+ entry blocker, CdCl2 did not reduce inotropic effects of adrenaline whereas ryanodine treatment inhibited them. In contrast, nitrendipine and CdCl2 treatment had major inhibitory effects in chloroethylclonidine-treated but lacked inhibitory effects in phenoxybenzamine-treated ventricular strips. 6. We conclude that inotropic effects of adrenaline in rat heart are mediated mainly by alpha 1B-adrenoceptors via release of Ca2+ from an intracellular pool. Following inactivation of alpha 1B-adrenoceptors by chloroethylclonidine treatment, alpha lA-adrenoceptors can fully compensate and mediate inotropic effects by promoting influx of extracellular Ca2+ at least partly via voltage-operated channels.Therefore, we speculate that alpha 1B-adrenoceptors exert a tonic inhibitory effect on alpha 1A-adrenoceptors.", 
    "110": "1. Vascular hyporesponsiveness in portal hypertension has been demonstrated to various vasoconstrictors including noradrenaline (NA). The present study aimed to determine whether the attenuated vascular responsiveness to NA is due to a change in the affinity or the number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. 2. Partial portal vein ligation (PVL) was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats to produce portal hypertension. Vascular responsiveness to NA was assayed in portal vein, mesenteric artery or tail artery. The affinity and number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors were determined by specific binding of [125I]-HEAT (2-beta-4-hydroxy-3-iodophenyethyl-aminomethyltetralone). 3. In the presence of yohimbine (10(-7) M, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (10(-6) M, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), and two catecholamine uptake inhibitors, desipramine (10(-7) M) and normetanephrine (10(-6) M), the maximum responses to NA were decreased in all three blood vessels of PVL rats: 45% decrease in portal vein, 25% in mesenteric artery and 18% in tail artery. 4. The EC50 values of NA and the pA2 values of prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, in all three blood vessels were not significantly different between sham-operated and PVL rats. 5. The KD and Bmax values for specific binding of [125I]-HEAT or the Ki values for NA in the crude membrane preparations of either mesenteric artery or tail artery were also not significantly different between the two groups. 6. It is concluded that the vascular hyporesponsiveness to NA in the mesenteric artery or tail artery of PVL rats is not due to changes in the affinity or number of alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "111": "Various beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have different effects on myocardial function. A clinical study was performed in 30 patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension to compare the effects of single intravenous doses of 0.15 mg/kg celiprolol (n = 16) (third generation beta-blocking agent) and metoprolol (n = 14) (second generation) on left ventricular diastolic function. Parameters derived from pressure, volume, flow, time intervals and their combination were used to characterise diastolic function. After celiprolol administration, parameters of diastolic myocardial function improve (dp/dtip-; relaxation time constant T1, peak filling rate PFR; first-third filling rate FF1/3 or diastolic wall stress-time integral Sigdiasc) or remain unchanged. In contrast, after metoprolol administration parameters of diastolic function seem to be deteriorated (dp/dtip-, T1; Sigdiasc). This indicates an improvement in myocardial relaxation and filling under the influence of celiprolol but not under metoprolol. The left shift of the pressure-volume loops after celiprolol (n = 13), in contrast to metoprolol, supports this interpretation. Celiprolol did not show any deterioration of diastolic function in patients with coronary heart disease and arterial hypertension under these acute conditions.",

Scatchard analysis of [125I]PIN binding in temporal cortex confirmed the lack of differences in binding density and no changes in KD between these two subject groups. These findings do not support alterations in the density or affinity of beta-adrenoceptor binding in cerebral cortex in BD.",

These agents are slowly gaining acceptance as a novel treatment modality for patients who have congestive heart failure.", 
    "114": "The aim of this study was to assess life survival, and arterial and cardiac structural changes following chronic selective beta-blockade in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Twenty-two SHR aged 3 months and 20 SHR aged 18 months were treated with the beta 1-blocking agent bisoprolol (10 mg/kg/day) or placebo for a period of 2 months. At the end of this period left and right ventricular weight and morphometric parameters of five different arterial segments (thoracic and abdominal aorta, renal, mesenteric, and carotid arteries) were evaluated. In younger SHR, systolic blood pressure (tail-cuff method) was significantly lower in drug-treated animals (225 +/- 15 v 185 +/- 10 mm Hg in placebo-treated animals; P < .001); left ventricular weight was significantly lower in drug-treated rats (0.845 +/- 0.02 v 0.932 +/- 0.03 g; P < .05); medial thickness was significantly lower in the bisoprolol-treated rats at the site of the thoracic (-22%) and abdominal (-17%) aorta, and mesenteric artery (-29%); in the renal and carotid arteries, no change in medial thickness was observed. In older SHR, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were significantly higher (P < .01) in the placebo group. In bisoprolol-treated animals, systolic blood pressure did not change and was even significantly higher than in controls. Heart weight and medial thickness of the thoracic aorta and the renal arteries were significantly lower in the Bisoprolol group. These results provide evidence that 2 months of selective beta-blockade in adult SHR has an important antihypertrophic cardiac and vascular effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The aim of this study was to compare the safety and antihypertensive efficacy of 25 to 50 mg carvedilol once daily with 50 to 100 mg atenolol once daily in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. This was a multicenter study conducted in Europe. After a single-blind placebo run-in phase, 325 eligible patients with stable hypertension were randomized to receive 25 mg carvedilol once daily (161 patients) or 50 mg atenolol (164 patients) in a double-blind 8-week treatment phase. After 4 weeks, the dosage was doubled if there was inadequate response. The primary index of efficacy (response) was the reduction of mean sitting diastolic blood pressure to 90 mg Hg or less (normalized) or by at least 10 mm Hg from baseline. At each of three to six run-in phase visits and after 2, 4, and 8 weeks of treatment, sitting blood pressure and heart rate at trough were measured in triplicate, and body weight, adverse experiences, compliance, and use of concomitant medications were assessed. Laboratory tests, including fasting serum lipids, and electrocardiograms were also monitored during the trial. After 8 weeks of treatment, response rates in the carvedilol and atenolol treatment groups were 75% and 82%, respectively. Compared to baseline, the mean sitting blood pressure was significantly (P < .05) reduced by carvedilol from 165/104 mm Hg to 147/89 mm Hg.

Eleven male sea level residents were divided into a control group (n = 5) receiving a placebo or a drug group (n = 6) receiving 240 mg/day of propranolol. All subjects were studied at rest and during 45 min of submaximal exercise (approximately 50% of sea level maximal O2 uptake) at sea level (SL) and within 4 h of exposure to and after 3 wk residence at 4,300 m (summit of Pikes Peak). Blood samples were collected from the femoral artery for epinephrine and lactate concentration. Exercising blood lactate concentration was significantly different across all altitude conditions such that AC > CH > SL (P < 0.05). For a given arterial O2 saturation, mean exercising blood lactates were lower for the beta-blocked group compared with controls; however, both groups demonstrated similar patterns across all conditions. Epinephrine levels during exercise followed a similar pattern to that of lactate, averaging 0.67, 0.43, and 0.29 ng/ml for AC, CH, and SL, respectively. The correlation between lactate and epinephrine was 0.93 and 0.84 for control and beta-blocked subjects, respectively. Whereas during exercise epinephrine was consistently higher for the beta-blocked group than controls, this difference was only significant during CH exposure. The epinephrine response was related to the extent of hypoxia in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "117": "To investigate the functional innervation pattern in smooth muscle of bovine ophthalmic artery, we studied the effect of electrical stimulation and various drugs on the mechanical responses of this muscle using isometric tension recording methods. Electrical stimulation evoked phasic contractions which were abolished by guanethidine and tetrodotoxin (TTX), suggesting that the responses were neurogenic in origin. Phentolamine (10(-5) M) and 10(-5) M timolol did not affect this contractions, but 10(-5) M phentolamine and 10(-6) M prazosin markedly reduced the amplitude of contraction evoked by exogenously applied phenylephrine (10(-5) M). Electrical stimulation applied during sustained contraction evoked by 5-hydroxytryptamine in the presence of guanethidine and atropine evoked relaxation which was markedly suppressed by TTX. These results indicate that bovine ophthalmic artery is innervated by adrenergic nerve fibers, and an unidentified neurotransmitter, other than noradrenaline, may play an important role in the excitatory neuroeffector transmission, and that the tissue is also innervated by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerve fibers.",

The discounting, applied to each individual in a trial, utilizes a method proposed by Chuang-Stein and co-authors to consolidate the safety data collected in the trial. The collating of the safety information allows one to estimate quantitatively the risk experienced by each individual, and therefore enables the construction of a risk-adjusted benefit measure for the same individual. We discuss the rationale for the adjusting method and examine its impact on the inference. When the discounting process reflects an individual's choice, the results should be interpreted at the individual level. An example is given to illustrate the approach.",

    "121": "A cytosolic peptide-GTP complex that stimulates l-isoproterenol-responsive adenylate cyclase activity was identified in the rat liver. The peptide component was purified and characterized with regard to its interaction with GTP. The peptide was isolated as a complex form with GTP on a Sephadex G-25 column in 1 mM NaHCO3, and was purified as a dissociated form, with relative molecular weight (M(r)) approximately 3,000 and GTP-binding ability, in 200 mM ammonium acetate. The purified peptide alone displayed little stimulatory effect on adenylate cyclase activity, but its reassociated form with GTP clearly enhanced the effect of GTP on the enzyme activity. The isoproterenol competition curve using l-[3H]dihydroalprenolol as an antagonist ligand shifted to lower affinity by the addition of the peptide reassociated with GTP (16.5-fold shift), whereas the same concentration of GTP (1 microM) or the peptide alone had little or no effect (1.5- or 0.9-fold shift, respectively). Furthermore, the peptide enhanced the GTP effect in response to l-isoproterenol but not to glucagon, prostaglandin E1, or fluoride. These results suggest that the cytosolic peptide potentiates the effect of GTP on the agonist-beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase ternary complex."
