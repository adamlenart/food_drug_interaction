    "1": "In a child with aniridia and glaucoma, a beta-receptor blocking drug was used in combination with Latanoprost. This was done because other combinations of antiglaucoma eyedrops had an insufficient pressure-reducing effect. It was very effective in reducing the pressure. However, there was a side effect: heavy sweat secretion over the entire body occurred 1-2 h after the application of Latanoprost drops. This side effect has not been described previously, and it indicates a systemic side effect of Latanoprost eyedrops. The systemic side effects of this substance are stronger then heretofore assumed, even in the case of proper local application. Therefore, one should be particularly careful in utilizing this substance, especially in children.",

Out of 616 eyes with YAG iridotomy between 1983 and 1987, 146 eyes/patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria: observation time of minimum 3 months after iridotomy, preoperative examination without signs of preexisting synechiae, postoperative examination at discharge and a later control examination in mydriasis to exclude posterior synechiae.",

Eyes with postoperative long-term therapy with miotics or beta-blockers showed posterior synechiae significantly more often than eyes without post-operative miotic or beta-blocker therapy. Eyes that received DPE in the early post-operative period developed posterior synechiae significantly less often. The number of laser pulses and the mean total energy used were significantly higher in eyes which later developed posterior synechiae. In the group of patients with glaucomatous attack women outnumbered men by four to one, but there was no significant difference in refraction between women and men.",

    "5": "The natriuretic peptide (NP) system is one of the most important systems regulating blood pressure and body-fluid homeostasis. The biological activities of the system are determined by the NPs and the receptors, which are comprised of three subtypes: NP-AR and NP-BR related to biological activities and NP-CR related to the clearance of NP. We focused our studies on the receptor subtypes. In hypertensive rats (SHR-SP/Izm, DOCA/salt), NP-AR was upregulated and NP-CR was downregulated. The ACE inhibitor derapril, but not the Ca2+ blocker manidipine, normalized the upregulated NP-AR, but the effect was completely abolished by the bradykinin beta 2-receptor antagonist, suggesting that bradykinin regulates the vascular NP-AR. The AT1 antagonist TCV-116, but not manidipine, reversed the downregulated NP-CR. Ang II decreased NP-CR in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells. These results suggest that upregulation of NP-AR and downregulation of NP-CR with the increased plasma NPs counteract hypertension by enhancing the action of NP. A beta-blocker (carvedilol) potentiated the hypotensive action of NPs by increasing plasma NPs and enhancing the vascular response to NPs via downregulation of the vascular and lung NP-CR. The newly found mode of actions could be related to its anti-heart failure effect. In genetically hyperglycemic Wistar fatty rats, vascular NP-BR and NP-AR were upregulated. Since plasma ANP and vascular CNP were significantly increased, the local CNP/NP-BR system as well as the systemic ANP/NP-AR system may play an important role in counteracting vascular remodeling in diabetes mellitus. All these observations provide in vivo evidence for the pathophysiological significance of the receptor subtype of the NPs.",

    "15": "A simple method for the measurement of pindolol enantiomers by HPLC is presented. Alkalinized serum or urine is extracted with ethyl acetate and the residue remaining after evaporation of the organic layer is then derivatised with (S)-(-)-alpha-methylbenzyl isocyanate. The diastereoisomers of derivatised pindolol and metoprolol (internal standard) are separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 silica column and detected using fluorescence (excitation gamma: 215 nm, emission gamma: 320 nm). The assay displays reproducible linearity for pindolol enantiomers with a correlation coefficient of r2> or =0.998 over the concentration range 8-100 ng ml(-1) for plasma and 0.1-2.5 microg ml(-1) for urine. The coefficient of variation for accuracy and precision of the quality control samples for both plasma and urine are consistently <10%. Assay parameters are similar to those of previously published assays for pindolol enantiomers, however this assay is significantly easier and cheaper to run. Clinically relevant concentrations of each pindolol enantiomer can readily be measured.", 
    "16": "1. The histamine H2 receptor agonists, dimaprit, impromidine, amthamine, and several dimaprit- and impromidine-analogues were investigated for their spasmolytic activity on the guinea pig duodenum, precontracted with acetylcholine or KCl. 2. Almost all the H2 receptor agonists exerted a histamine H2 receptor-independent muscle relaxation, which was more evident on acetylcholine- than on KCl-precontracted preparations. 3. The relaxing activity of these compounds was independent of inhibitory receptors, like beta-adrenergic, GABA-ergic, serotoninergic, etc. Similarly, modifications of cyclic nucleotide metabolism and nitric oxide production did not appear to be involved. 4. The behavior of histamine H2-receptor agonists was shared only by the Na+-blocker procaine, the intracellular Ca2+-antagonist ruthenium red and, at least in terms of efficacy, by the protein kinase C inhibitor, chelerithrine. 5. This spasmolytic effect is probably due to an impairment of receptor-mediated depolarization at the plasma membrane level and/or an inhibitory activity on the protein kinase C-dependent activation of the contractile machinery. 6. Finally, our findings suggest that the histamine H2 receptor-independent muscle relaxation is a general feature shown by H2 receptor agonists endowed with different chemical structure and the putative spasmolytic \"receptor\" prefers a (substituted) thiazole over a (substituted) imidazole.", 
    "17": "Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only decrease the production of angiotensin II but also decrease the degradation of bradykinin.

Icatibant did not alter the renal hemodynamic response to captopril, but it significantly altered the change in plasma renin activity in response to ACE inhibition (-0.4+/-0.4 ng of angiotensin I per milliliter per hour, as compared with 2.0+/-0.7 ng per milliliter per hour for captopril alone; P=0.007).

    "21": "To examine the significance of brown adipose tissue for the thermogenic response to glucagon, we injected glucagon intraperitoneally into rats (that have glucagon-sensitive brown fat cells) and into hamsters (that have glucagon-insensitive brown fat cells). Although a thermogenic response to glucagon injection was apparently observed in rats, this response was not augmented by cold acclimation and was not dose dependent. Similar observations were made in hamsters. The thermogenic response could be fully blocked by prior injection of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. Thus no direct thermogenic response to injected glucagon could be demonstrated, and the thermogenic response observed was fully due to vehicle injection. However, glucagon injection was able to unmask mitochondrial [3H]GDP binding. As expected, isolated brown fat cells from rats and mice responded thermogenically to glucagon but brown fat cells from hamsters were unresponsive. The EC50 of the rat brown fat cells was high (5 nM); these cells also responded to secretin, with an EC50 of 22 nM. It was concluded that, in contrast to earlier observations, no thermogenic response to injected glucagon could be observed; this may be related to differences in glucagon preparations. Brown fat cells from certain species are, however, glucagon sensitive. It is uncertain whether glucagon is the endogenous agonist for these receptors, but the presence of the glucagon-responsive receptor indicates alternative means to norepinephrine for stimulation of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and, probably, of recruitment.", 
    "22": "Gallbladder motility is modulated by intrinsic nerves, the identities of which are not well established. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nicotinic receptor stimulation of intrinsic nerves on gallbladder muscle contractility. Guinea pig gallbladder muscle strips were studied in vitro. Histamine 1 microM was used to increase baseline tone. The nicotinic receptor agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP), produced a biphasic response characterized by an initial transient contraction followed by a sustained relaxation. The initial contraction was inhibited by the neural blocker tetrodotoxin, the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium, and the muscarinic antagonist atropine, but not by a substance P receptor antagonist or a bombesin receptor antagonist. The relaxation response to DMPP was not affected by tetrodotoxin, but was reduced by hexamethonium and omega-conotoxin GVIA, an inhibitor of neurotransmitter release. The relaxation response was reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME, but not by a vasoactive intestinal peptide antagonist or propranolol. DMPP produces a biphasic response in the guinea pig gallbladder. The initial contractile response is mediated by nicotinic receptors on the cell body or axon of cholinergic nerves. The relaxation response appears to result, in part, from activation of nicotinic receptors on nerve terminals of nitric oxide-releasing nerves. These results suggest nicotinic receptors have heterogeneity in location depending on excitatory or inhibitory neuronal function.",

The electrophoretic separation is performed using a 78-cm x 75-micron-i.d. (70-cm effective length) fused-silica capillary. A borate buffer (pH 9) is used as running electrolyte. The sample is hydrostatically introduced for 20 s, and the running voltage is 25 kV at the injector end of the capillary. The analysis of urine samples requires the optimization of solid-phase extraction methods, achieving recoveries > or = 61% for all the drugs and good separation from the urine matrix. The method is successfully applied to the determination of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations and in urine samples collected after the intake of Neatenol Diu (100 mg atenolol-5 mg bendroflumethiazide) and Kalten (50 mg atenolol-25 mg hydrochlorothiazide-2.5 mg amiloride).

    "28": "Hypertension is a very common vascular disease. It is seen in adolescents, obese persons, postmenopausal women, and the elderly. A nonpharmacologic approach to treatment is a critical first step in management. The modalities include a diet low in salt and saturated fat, exercise, less than 2 ounces of alcohol daily, and abstinence from smoking. Dynamic (aerobic) exercise is effective in lowering blood pressure (BP) only if performed regularly. Weight reduction by diet must be combined with exercise if there is to be a reduction in BP. Strength training is not to be considered as an alternative to aerobic training for reducing BP. Antihypertensive mediation can be added to nonpharmacologic interventions for additional BP reduction. Beta-blockade is not a contraindication to exercise training.", 
    "29": "The aim of this study was to examine the influence of simulated ischaemia on the contractility and responsiveness to phenylephrine of rat isolated papillary muscle in standard diet fed (SD) and hyperlipidemic diet fed (HLD) rats. The following parameters were measured: force of contraction (Fc), rate of rise (+dF/dt) and rate of fall (-dF/dt) of force of contraction, time to peak contraction (ttp) and relaxation time at 10% of total amplitude of contraction (tt10). The baseline values of Fc and +dF/dt, but, not -dF/dt, were significantly lower in HLD group than in SD group. Tissues from HLD rats were more sensitive to ischaemia regarding Fc, +dF/dt and -dF/dt. Moreover, reprefusion completely reversed the effects of ischaemia only in SD rats, but not in HLD rats, regarding Fc and +dF/dt. In contrast, a recovery of -dF/dt during reperfusion occurred only in the HLD group. In SD rats, phenylephrine (10 and 30 microM) had no effect on the contractility or induced megative inotropic effects (100 and 300 microM). Propranolol (1 microM), a non-selective blocker of beta-adrenoceptors, had no effects on this action. Chloroethylclonidine (CEC) (1 microM), a selectivw blocker of alpha 1b-adrenoceptor subtype, but not WB-4101(2-((2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)amino-methyl-1,4-benzodioxane), a selective blocker of alpha 1a adrenoceptor subtype, abolishes the negative inotropic action of phenylephrine. In HLD rats, phenylephrine had positive inotropic action (10 and 30 microM). The results indicate that hyperlipidemic diet in rats leads to the suppression of force of contraction and velocity of contraction, but not velocity of relaxation of isolated heart muscle. Under such a condition, heart muscle is more sensitive to ischaemia, but has better responsiveness to phenylephrine after ischeamia-reperfusion period.", 
    "30": "To evaluate the extent to which the protective effect of metoprolol was accompanied by changes in myocardial oxygen consumption and metabolism, thrombotic occlusion of coronary artery followed by infusion of metoprolol or placebo was performed in twenty four German Shepherds. To restore a coronary blood flow rt-PA was administered. Plasma levels of oxygen, glucose, lactic acid, non esterified fatty acids, triacylglyceride and adenosine breakdown products were measured before and at the end of the occlusion and in the early and late reperfusion periods. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by means of radioactive tracer microspheres. Infarct size was estimated after perfusion and staining of excised hearts with Evans blue. Plasma levels of metoprolol were determinated before the end of occlusion and during reperfusion and therapeutic concentrations were confirmed. The infarct size was smaller in dogs receiving metoprolol (21.6 +/- 20.7 vs 43.0 +/- 17.3% p. < 0.02). Coronary collateral blood flow was greater in metoprolol than in placebo dogs (18.68 +/- 7.58 vs 11.05 +/- 6.10 ml/min/100g, p. < 0.01). As a consequence of myocardial ischemia a shift toward carbohydrate utilization, the myocardial lactate release and the accompanying symptoms of diminished myocardial lipid uptake were observed. A washout of adenosine degradation products during early reperfusion was also noticed. In beta 1 blocked animals the reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption and preserved myocardial uptake of lactate and non esterified fatty acids were documented.", 
    "31": "The pharmacologic management of migraine has traditionally focused on two approaches: symptomatic treatment and prophylactic therapy. The objective of symptomatic treatment is to reduce the intensity and duration of pain with its attendant symptoms and to optimize the patient's ability to function normally. The efficacy of most abortive antimigrainous drugs in probably related to their inhibitory effects on neurogenic inflammation mediated through serotoninergic control mechanisms. A variety of treatment strategies provide effective treatment for most attacks of moderate to severe migraine when utilizing one or a combination of the following classes of drugs: simple analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiemetics, narcotic analgesics, ergot derivatives, and serotonin1-agonists. The choice of medication for an acute attack depends on factors such as the severity of the attack, the presence or absence of vomiting, time from onset of pain to peak pain level, rate of bioavailability of the drug, comorbid medical conditions, and the side effect profile of the drug. The major objective of prophylactic therapy is the reduction of frequency, duration, and intensity of attacks. Beta-blocking drugs without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (such as propranolol), amitriptyline, flunarizine, serotonin antagonists (such as methysergide) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as naproxen) are the five main classes of drugs or agents that may be used as prophylactics.", 
    "32": "Even today, heart failure due to doxorubicin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy seems to have a poor prognosis, as it is often irreversible and relatively unresponsive to standard medical treatment. This paper describes the first case of a patient complaining of severe symptoms of congestive heart failure due to doxorubicin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy unresponsive to standard medical treatment (digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), who showed complete clinical recovery and significant improvement of left ventricular dysfunction after carvedilol treatment. It also illustrates the possibility that carvedilol may be a first-choice drug for the treatment of this disease.", 
    "33": "Impaired myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR) signaling, including desensitization and functional uncoupling, is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. A contributing mechanism for this impairment may involve enhanced myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (betaARK1) activity because levels of this betaAR-desensitizing G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) are increased in heart failure. An hypothesis has emerged that increased sympathetic nervous system activity associated with heart failure might be the initial stimulus for betaAR signaling alterations, including desensitization. We have chronically treated mice with drugs that either activate or antagonize betaARs to study the dynamic relationship between betaAR activation and myocardial levels of betaARK1.", 
    "34": "Long-term in vivo stimulation of betaARs results in the impairment of cardiac +betaAR signaling and increases the level of expression (mRNA and protein) and activity of +betaARK1 but not that of GRK5, a second GRK abundantly expressed in the myocardium. Long-term beta-blocker treatment, including the use of carvedilol, improves myocardial betaAR signaling and reduces betaARK1 levels in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Identical results were obtained in vitro in cultured cells, demonstrating that the regulation of GRK expression is directly linked to betaAR signaling.", 
    "35": "This report demonstrates, for the first time, that betaAR stimulation can significantly increase the expression of betaARK1 , whereas beta-blockade decreases expression. This reciprocal regulation of betaARK1 documents a novel mechanism of ligand-induced betaAR regulation and provides important insights into the potential mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of beta-blockers, such as carvedilol, in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "36": "A recent, prospective randomized trial has suggested that long-term use of prophylactic beta-adrenergic blocking agents may slow the rate of aortic dilation in those patients with Marfan's syndrome exhibiting evidence of existing dilation. Accordingly, administration of such medication from the midtrimester onward has been advocated in these patients. Acute oral administration of propranolol (80 mg) has been shown to depress fetal heart rate response to vibroacoustic stimulation. We present a case in which chronic administration of propranolol 150 mg/day to a patient with Marfan's syndrome with existing aortic root dilation was associated with repeated abnormal intrapartum fetal heart rate responses to vibroacoustic stimulation. Subsequent delivery of a nonhypoxic, nonacidotic infant suggests that maternal administration of beta-blockers should be considered in the interpretation of results of fetal vibroacoustic stimulation. This case also supports that in similar clinical presentations, ultrasonographic confirmation of the fetal startle response, or alternatively observation of the resulting fetal recoil may be utilized rather than the fetal heart rate, which may be modulated by maternal medications.", 
    "37": "1. We have studied the effects of muscarinic cholinoceptor agonists and subtype-preferring antagonists on the isometric contraction of smooth muscle strips from dog prostate. 2. Acetylcholine and carbachol induced contraction of prostate strips from the peripheral zone, ('the capsule'). Bethanechol contracted the tissue but not at lower doses. McN-A-343 and oxotremorine-M showed the same effects. 3. Blocking alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors with phentolamine and propranolol, respectively, did not modify carbachol-induced contractions. 4. The nicotinic receptor blocker, hexamethonium (10(-6)-10(-4) M) did not affect the contractile response evoked by a single dose of carbachol (10(-5) M), whilst the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (10(-11)-10(-9) M), inhibited it in a competitive manner. 5. The muscarinic M1 (pirenzepine), M2 [AF-DX 116, himbacine (M2/M4) and methoctramine], M3 (HHSID and f-F-HHSID), and putative M4 (tropicamide) antagonists reduced significantly the carbachol-induced contractions. The pIC50 values were: atropine (10.01) > himbacine (8.3) > methoctramine (7.85) > AF-DX 116 (7.60) > HHSID (7.21) > p-F-HHSID (7.10) > pirenzepine (7.30) > tropicamide (7.00). 6.

    "38": "The functional properties of the isolated porcine and bovine central adrenomedullary veins were compared, with emphasis on the active tension responses to high K+, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). In the porcine vein, the contraction evoked by ET-1 was 4--5-fold higher than with high K+, as in the bovine vein. The potencies for ET-1 were similar in ring and strip preparations of the porcine vein, with EC50 values 5--7-fold higher than in the bovine vein. In preparations previously exposed to ET-1 the contractions evoked by high K+ and NPY were potentiated and facilitated, respectively,. However, only in the porcine vein was the ET-1 contraction sustained. This contraction was effectively relaxed by milrinone, indicating a role for cGMP inhibited cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in the sustained contraction. Caffeine and forskolin were also effective relaxants of contractions evoked by ET-1 in both veins, suggesting relaxation by elevated levels of cAMP. The K(+)-contracted porcine, but not bovine, vein was relaxed by acetylcholine (ACh) and vasointestinal polypeptide in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating species differences with respect to signal transduction leading to increases in cyclic nucleotides. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that ET-1 is the main constrictor of the porcine central adrenomedullary vein, with significant species differences in mode of contraction and relaxation. These findings suggest roles for the endogeneously released ET-1 and NPY in regulation of venous contractility within the adrenal gland of mammals.",

    "66": "Human nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subtypes alpha3 beta2, alpha3 beta2 alpha5, alpha3 beta4, and alpha3 beta4 alpha5 were stably expressed in cells derived from the human embryonic kidney cell line 293. alpha3 beta4 AChRs were found in prominent 2-micrometer patches on the cell surface, whereas most alpha3 beta2 AChRs were more diffusely distributed. The functional properties of the alpha3 AChRs in tsA201 cells were characterized by whole cell patch clamp using both acetylcholine and nicotine as agonists. Nicotine was a partial agonist on alpha3 beta4 AChRs and nearly a full agonist on alpha3 beta2 alpha5 AChRs. Chronic exposure of cells expressing alpha3 beta2 AChRs or alpha3 beta2 alpha5 AChRs to nicotine or carbamylcholine increased their amount up to 24-fold but had no effect on the amount of alpha3beta4 or alpha3 beta4 alpha5 AChRs, i.e. the up-regulation of alpha3 AChRs depended on the presence of beta2 but not beta4 subunits in the AChRs. This was also found to be true of alpha3 AChRs in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y. In the absence of nicotine, alpha3 beta2 AChRs were expressed at much lower levels than alpha3 beta4 AChRs, but in the presence of nicotine, the amount of alpha3 beta2 AChRs exceeded that of alpha3 beta4 AChRs. Up-regulation was seen for both total AChRs and surface AChRs. Up-regulated alpha3beta2 AChRs were functional. The nicotinic antagonists curare and dihydro-beta-erythroidine also up-regulated alpha3 beta2 AChRs, but only by 3-5-fold. The channel blocker mecamylamine did not cause up-regulation of alpha3 beta2 AChRs and inhibited up-regulation by nicotine. Our data suggest that up-regulation of alpha3 beta2 AChRs in these lines by nicotine results from both increased subunit assembly and decreased AChR turnover.", 
    "67": "We studied ultradian and circadian variations in blood pressure (BP) in patients with essential hypertension who were receiving antihypertensive agents. No patient had previously received antihypertensive agents before this study began. After a 2-wk control period, we performed ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in 86 patients with essential hypertension (WHO stages I or II). The patients were then given a long-acting angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) (captopril or imidapril), a beta-receptor blocker (arotinolol or bisoprolol), or a calcium channel blocker (nisoldipine or benidipine) twice daily to control BP. We evaluated the patients' BP once every 2 wk to ensure optimal control. After 12 wk, ultradian and circadian variations in BP were analyzed by the maximum entropy method (MEM). All antihypertensive agents decreased office systolic BP (SBP), office diastolic BP (DBP), 24-h SBP, and 24-h DBP. ACEI did not change office, 24-h, daytime, or nighttime pulse rate (PR). Arotinolol and bisoprolol decreased 24-h PR. All antihypertensive agents decreased 24-h, daytime, and nighttime pressure rate product. MEM showed that no antihypertensive agent affected the circadian variation in the 1st peak (24-h periodicity) of SBP, DBP, or PR. However, calcium channel blockers shortened the periodicity of circadian variations in the 2nd peak (12-h periodicity) of SBP and the 3rd peak (8 to 6 h periodicity) of SBP. Therefore, ultradian variations in BP should be carefully monitored in hypertensive patients treated with calcium channel blockers.", 
    "68": "1. It has been shown that bradykinin (BK) causes sensitization of airway sensory neurons and an enhancement of the cough reflex in guinea-pigs. In the present study, the guinea-pig isolated perfused lung was used to investigate the possible enhancement by BK of histamine-evoked neuropeptide release from peripheral terminals of primary afferent neurons, and to determine the contribution of cyclooxygenase products of arachidonate metabolism to this effect. 2. The lung was perfused with oxygenated physiological salt solution containing peptidase inhibitors (thiorphan, bestatin and captopril, 1 microM each). BK and histamine were added to the perfusate for 10 and 5 min, respectively. 3. BK alone (0.1 microM) evoked the release of 10.35+/-2.4 fmol immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), histamine alone (100 microM) evoked the release of 12.7+/-1.6 fmol CGRP. Stimulation with 100 microM histamine in the presence of 0.1 microM BK (added 5 min before histamine and present during histamine) evoked the release of 67.1+/-5.3 fmol CGRP. 4. Prostaglandin (PG) release was stimulated by BK (418+/-71 pmol 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF2alpha and 345+/-59 pmol 6-keto-PGF1alpha), and, to a lesser extent, by histamine (36.1+/-7.4 pmol 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF2alpha, and 24.6+/-3.9 pmol 6-keto-PGF1alpha). Prostaglandin release induced by histamine in the presence of BK was not significantly higher than with BK alone. 5. Indomethacin (5 microM) as well as the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist HOE140 (icatibant, 1 microM) inhibited prostaglandin release following stimulation with histamine in combination with BK. CGRP release evoked by histamine in combination with BK was attenuated by indomethacin and HOE140 to 22.1+/-7.8 fmol and 16.4+/-3.8 fmol, respectively, significantly less than the value obtained in control experiments (67.1+/-5.3 fmol). 6. The results suggest that BK-induced stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis results in facilitation of histamine-evoked release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides from afferent neurons, a mechanism that probably becomes relevant during inflammation, and that can be blocked by a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist.", 
    "69": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are now commonly used in the treatment of major depression. In all patients starting treatment, the intent-to-treat response rate is about 50%. The other 50% will require some change in treatment, either augmentation or switch to a different agent. In this report, augmentation strategies are reviewed, with special attention to those strategies that have been used with the SSRIs. The data for switching antidepressants also are reviewed. Although there are no direct comparison studies of augmentation strategies versus switching that address the question of relative efficacy, the tactical issues that pertain to augmentation or switching are discussed.", 
    "70": "Catestatin (bovine chromogranin A(344-364); RSMRLSFRARGYGFRGPGLQL), reduces catecholamine secretion from chromaffin cells in vitro. We investigated the effects of this peptide on catecholamine release and blood pressure in vivo. Intravenous catestatin reduced pressor responses to activation of sympathetic outflow by electrical stimulation in rats, and the catestatin effect persisted even after adrenergic (alpha plus beta) blockade. Catestatin did not alter plasma norepinephrine levels, but increased plasma epinephrine 11-fold. Catestatin also blunted pressor responses to exogenous neuropeptide Y agonists. A control peptide (chromogranin A(141-160)) did not alter pressor or catecholamine responses to electrical stimulation. Pretreatment with a histamine H1 receptor antagonist blocked both the vasodepressor response to catestatin and the elevation in plasma epinephrine. Catestatin elevated endogenous circulating histamine 21-fold, and exogenous histamine mimicked both the epinephrine elevation and the vasodepressor actions of catestatin. We conclude that catestatin is a potent vasodilator in vivo whose actions appear to be mediated, at least in part, by histamine release and action at H1 receptors.", 
    "71": "Administration of non-selective beta-blocker propranolol prevented the stress-activated action whereas the alpha-agonist isoprenaline enhanced the effect of immobilisation stress on the rat mast cells. beta-antagonists or agonists exerted no effect on the heparine secretion by the mast cells. ACTH activated the secretion in the absence of stress.", 
    "72": "Beta-blocker-induced benefit in heart failure is under intense evaluation. Several large-scale mortality trials are currently being performed, with CIBIS II evaluating bisoprolol. The economic impact of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure has not been previously determined. The present study is a cost-effectiveness evaluation of bisoprolol treatment based on CIBIS I data. It considers direct costs, that is, the bisoprolol medication cost and the cost of hospitalization related to heart failure and its complications. Hospitalization costs were calculated from the French system of classification (PMSI), which provides costs according to homogeneous groups of patients (GHM). The cost difference between bisoprolol and placebo in the entire CIBIS population and the trial duration result from an increase in cost caused by bisoprolol treatment (+ 2018 Frs/patient) and a decrease in cost related to reduced hospitalization (6349 Frs/patient). A total savings per patient of about 4330 Frs was produced by bisoprolol. Cost reduction is still more pronounced in patients not having a history of myocardial infarction. We conclude that heart failure therapy with bisoprolol lowers medical healthcare costs, mainly due to the reduced rate of hospital admissions for heart failure.", 
    "73": "We have previously found that heterochiral fucodipeptides, L-Ser-D-Glu (3a) and D-Ser-L-Glu (3b), exhibited up to 20-100 times more potency than a sialyl Lewis X (sLeX, 1) and a 3'-sulfated Lewis X analogue (2) toward E-selectin binding and have also proposed, from molecular dynamics calculation, that their strong activities would depend on a possible formation of the type II and/or type II' beta-turn of compounds 3a,b (Tsukida, T.; Hiramatsu, Y.; Tsujishita, H.; Kiyoi, T.; Yoshida, M.; Kurokawa, K.; Moriyama, H.; Ohmoto, H.; Wada, Y.; Saito, T.; Kondo, H. J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40, 3534-3541). To clarify our hypothesis, we synthesized several analogues of compounds 3a,b and investigated their structure-activity relationships. As a result, it was indicated that the type II and/or type II' beta-turn conformation would be a comparatively tight form and would play important roles in favorable binding to E-selectin. These findings indicate that sLeX mimetics with type II and type II' beta-turn dipeptides could be a useful methodology for the design of an active selectin blocker.",

Acetylcholine is the neurohumoral transmitter for the cholinergic nerves, and ATP is the neurohumoral transmitter for purinergic innervation. Beta-adrenergic stimulation mediates relaxation of the bladder. In the current study, we investigated the effects of atropine, isoproterenol and propranolol on the bladder contraction induced by intra-arterial administration of acetylcholine and ATP.", 
    "75": "Mature male New Zealand White rabbits were used in this study. A polyethylene catheter with an outer diameter of 0.043 inches was inserted through the rabbit's right femoral artery until it reached the lower abdominal aorta. An 8 F catheter was inserted through the urethral orifice into the bladder and secured by tying a 2-0 silk ligature around the bladder neck. The catheter was connected to an infusion pump and a pressure transducer by a 3-way valve. After 15 ml. of saline was infused into the bladder, an intra-arterial administration of acetylcholine and ATP was infused and the change of intravesical pressure was quantitated and recorded with a Grass model 7D polygraph. The procedure was repeated after a 5-minute pretreatment with atropine, isoproterenol or propranolol.", 
    "76": "The results are summarized as follows: 1) Baseline intravesical pressure was not altered by pretreatment with atropine. Pretreatment with atropine shifted the dose-response curve of acetylcholine to the right and the maximal response was reduced by 9%, 49% and 77% respectively with pretreatment with atropine 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) mole/kg. The dose-response curve of ATP was not significantly affected by pretreatment with atropine. 2) Baseline intravesical pressure was lowered by pretreatment with isoproterenol. Pretreatment with isoproterenol shifted both dose-response curves of acetylcholine and ATP rightward. The maximal response of acetylcholine was reduced by 10%, 26% and 37% respectively, and the maximal response of ATP was reduced by 6%, 31% and 43% respectively by pretreatment with isoproterenol 10(-8), 10(-7) and 10(-6) mole/kg. 3) Baseline intravesical pressure was not changed by pretreatment with propranolol. Both dose-response curves of acetylcholine and ATP were not significantly affected by pretreatment with propranolol.", 
    "77": "In conclusion, pretreatment with atropine inhibited acetylcholine-induced bladder contraction, but had no effect on ATP-induced contraction. Pretreatment with isoproterenol significantly inhibited both contractile stimulation by acetylcholine and ATP. Pretreatment with beta-adrenergic antagonist had no effect on the bladder contraction induced either by acetylcholine or by ATP. Thus, although beta-adrenergic stimulation is capable of significantly inhibiting the contractile responses to both cholinergic and purinergic stimulation, under normal conditions, sympathetic nerves do not modulate either cholinergic or purinergic stimulation.", 
    "78": "FSH is the main regulator of Sertoli cell function. Nevertheless, several other effectors such as catecholamines can also stimulate these cells through the adenylyl cyclase transduction pathway. However, the expression of beta adrenergic receptors in Sertoli cells is a subject of controversy. The aim of the present study was to determine if there are physiologically functional beta adrenergic receptors in Sertoli cells and to which subtype(s) they belong. In freshly isolated Sertoli cells, isoproterenol, a non selective beta-adrenergic agonist, was found to stimulate cAMP production and tissue-type plasminogen activator secretion. Specific transcripts for the beta1 and beta2, but not beta3, subtypes were detected by RT-PCR analysis. Beta2 transcripts were the form expressed predominantly in Sertoli cells. Binding experiments carried out on freshly isolated and on cytospined Sertoli cells indicated that in both conditions, [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding was inhibited by a non-selective and a 2 selective antagonist, whereas a beta1 selective antagonist had no effect. Scatchard analysis of beta2 specific inhibition revealed a dissociation constant of 0.3 nM and a receptor density of 14000 sites per cell. In freshly isolated Sertoli cells, we observed that cAMP and tissue-type plasminogen activator were stimulated by isoproterenol and a beta2 selective agonist, but not by beta1 or beta3 selective agonists. Accordingly, the isoproterenol-stimulated tissue-type plasminogen activator responses were abolished by the beta2 selective antagonist only. In cultured Sertoli cells, the trend was the same: tissue-type plasminogen activator and transferrin secretions were increased by isoproterenol and beta2 but not by beta1 or beta3 selective agonists. We conclude that freshly isolated Sertoli cells express beta2 adrenergic receptors which are functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase and that these characteristics are preserved in cell culture. For the tested parameters, catecholamines and FSH effects were similar, but response magnitudes were systematically lower with beta agonists than with FSH. As norepinephrine is normally present in physiologically-relevant amounts in the interstitial fluid, it can be suspected to play a role in the regulation of Sertoli cell function.", 
    "79": "In a model of uncontrolled hemorrhagic hypotension (UCHH) in rats, we examined whether blood loss or blood chemistry were affected by (1) deliberate, controlled hypotension induced with labetalol (L) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and (2) intravenous (iv) fluid therapy. Two hours of UCHH was induced by resecting the distal 25% of the tail. L or SNP was infused with the aim of decreasing MAP to 50 mmHg. In the groups receiving iv fluid, 3 ml of 0.9% saline was given for each 1 ml of blood loss. L decreased blood loss (2.8+/-2.0 and 3.0+/-1.9 ml, respectively, in the groups not receiving and receiving iv fluid) compared to the groups not given hypotensive drugs (6.3+/-4.1 and 13.5+/-6.6 ml). SNP did not decrease blood loss (5.7+/-4.7 and 11.0+/-6.2 ml), increased serum potassium (5.0+/-0.6 and 5.8+/-0.4 mEq l(-1)), and with accompanying iv fluid administration decreased hematocrit, worsened acidosis, and increased mortality. In this model of 2 h of UCHH in rats, hypotension to MAP of 50 mmHg with L but not with SNP decreased blood loss.", 
    "80": "The aim of the study was to examine the hypotensive efficacy and tolerance of bisoprolol in elderly patients. Sixty patients (40 <65 years and 20 >65 years) with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 95 and 109 mm Hg) were included in the study. After a 2-week run-in period on placebo, patients began bisoprolol therapy (5 mg/d) for 12 weeks. After 4 weeks the dose was increased to 10 mg/d in those with a DBP > or =95 mm Hg. Additionally, in 10 patients over 65 years old, 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) was performed, after placebo and after bisoprolol (5 mg) administration. The hypotensive efficacy of bisoprolol in the elderly and younger patients was similar. Before and after treatment the mean difference of systolic BP (SBP) was 19.6 +/- 12.5 mm Hg and DBP 9.6 +/- 6.2 mm Hg in the younger patients and 16.1 +/- 13.6 mmHg and 9.5 +/- 6.0 mmHg in the elderly patients. Bisoprolol produced a similar reduction in heart rate (23.1% vs 17.1%) in the estimated groups. The tolerance of bisoprolol was good in both groups. There were no significant differences in adverse drug reactions between the groups.", 
    "81": "During recent decades the importance of perceiving isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) in cardiovascular pathophysiology has been changed from a benign condition to the major cardiovascular risk factor. Aging is per se associated with the deterioration in arterial compliance through both structural and functional changes in large arteries which mainly involves the intima and media. The observed changes result in a decrease of the lumen-to-wall ratio, the overall lumen cross-sectional area and an increase of arterial stiffness which especially involve the aorta and other elastic arteries. In addition to the structural changes in vessel walls, aging is associated with certain functional changes such as an increase in sympathetic system activity probably due to the age-related decreased sensitivity of beta-receptors. While the function of arterial wall alpha-receptors remains intact, in elderly subjects a shift towards arterial vasoconstriction can be observed. In many of the published studies the definition of ISH was based on the criterion 160/95 mm Hg or 160/90 mm Hg while in recognition of the high risk associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) the WHO/ISH guidelines and Report of the Sixth Joint National Committee on Hypertension indicated that ISH should be diagnosed with SBP as > or =140 mm Hg and diastolic BP (DBP) as <90 mm Hg. Thus the setting down of normal values of SBP will lead to an earlier diagnosis and treatment of ISH. Several prospective studies, such as the US Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Programme, confirmed this and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial demonstrated that for any given level of DBP, higher SBP was associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk. Moreover, data from the Framingham Study show that ISH was associated not only with increased mortality but also cardiovascular morbidity. Risk of non-fatal stroke and myocardial infarction was increased three and two-times respectively in the presence of ISH. Three major up-to-date studies that included patients with ISH have been published. In concordance to the previously published SHEP and MCR trials, the most recent, the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Trial (SYST-EUR), demonstrated that active treatment significantly reduces the risk of stroke and all fatal and non-fatal cardiac end-points, including sudden death. Of note, these benefits were demonstrated with new anti-hypertensive classes such as dihydropiridyne calcium channel blocker (nitrendipine) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). The necessity to carefully balance the benefits and risks of anti-hypertensive therapy in the elderly indicates that patients with suspected ISH should undergo careful BP measurements on at least three different occasions before the diagnosis is established and an orthostatic reaction should be evaluated. If non-pharmacological procedures fail, drug therapy should be considered, especially in elderly patients with a SBP over 160 mm Hg, since their risk of complications is markedly higher. Pharmacological treatment should also be strongly considered in patients with a SBP between 140 and 160 mm Hg with such concomitant cardiovascular risk factors as diabetes, angina pectoris, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The drug regimen should be simple, starting with a low dose of a single drug that is titrated slowly. The selection of the first-line anti-hypertensive agent should be based on a careful assessment of pathophysiological and clinical parameters in each individual geriatric patient.", 
    "82": "Supraventricular reentrant tachycardias are the most common cardiac arrhythmia observed in infancy and childhood. The often benign clinical course of the disease warrants careful selection of any antiarrhythmic drug given to prevent recurrencies, in order to avoid potentially dangerous side-effects such as proarrhythmia. This study reports our experience with atenolol in the longterm treatment of infants and children with supraventricular tachycardias.", 
    "83": "A search of our database was made and all the children admitted in our institution between 1987 and 1995 for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia were selected.

In 10 of the patients (72%) therapy with atenolol was considered successful and no further attacks of tachycardia occurred. In 2 patients a partial response to atenolol was seen with an important decrease in the frequency of tachycardias. Two patients showed no effect of treatment and the betablocker was withdrawn. The effect of the drug on heart rate and blood pressure was mild and did not lead to symptoms. In no case had the drug to be withdrawn for adverse effects. After a mean follow-up of 50 months (3-105 months), 7 patients were off the drug and free of recurrencies while among the 5 children still on atenolol, only one experienced rare episodes of tachycardia.",

    "86": "Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) are risk markers in cardiac disease. HRV is also an index of the sympathovagal modulation of heart rate. Their relations have been rarely analyzed. We aimed to study such relations in normal adult conscious rats by using a novel bradycardic agent, a sinus node inhibitor, S-16257. Placebo-drug crossover designs were used while monitoring HR with telemetry and analyzing HRV in both time and frequency domains. S-16257 (2 mg/kg; n = 10) decreased HR by 29% and markedly increased HRV in parallel. By using various combinations of S-16257, atropine (2 mg/kg), and propranolol (4 mg/kg), a positive relation was shown between RR interval and various indexes of HRV: the slower the HR, the greater the HRV. Nevertheless, there is one exception to this correlation. When S-16257 was associated with both atropine and propranolol, the deep bradycardia was accompanied by a reduction of HRV, which indicates that the physiologic negative correlation between HR and HRV is not an intrinsic property of the pacemaker but is highly dependent on the two components of the autonomic system.", 
    "87": "We studied inflammatory reactions induced by dermal application of the beta-blocker propranolol (PRL) in ethanol to guinea pigs in order to elucidate the relation of the reactions with the cumulative PRL permeating amount through the stratum corneum or the PRL content in the stripped skin, and to investigate the chemical mediators responsible for the reactions. The cumulative PRL permeating amount through the stratum corneum increased rapidly up to 2 h after dermal application, then increased linearly with time up to 24 h after application. Visual observation revealed formation of erythema and edema at the applied site of PRL, and histopathological examination revealed infiltration of pseudoeosinophiles of dermis and epidermis and degeneration/necrosis of epidermis. In general, it was considered that the duration and the extent of these reactions were dependent on the PRL dosage and application time. It was expected that the cumulative PRL permeating amount through the stratum corneum could be used to predict possible inflammatory reactions during development of transdermal drug delivery systems. On the other hand, contact of PRL with guinea pig skin tissues released histamine, and intradermal injection of PRL caused an increase of capillary permeability at the site of application. Also, the inhibitory effects of anti-inflammatory agents (diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, indomethacin, cyproheptadine hydrochloride, CV3988 and AA-861) to PRL-induced erythema formation demonstrated that histamine and prostaglandins were responsible for the inflammatory reactions induced by PRL.",

Also, the mean episode frequency during follow-up time on and off beta-blockers was comparable (0.4+/-0.6 vs. 0.5+/-0.5, ns).",

The attenuating effect on leukocyte adherence could not be antagonized by the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist. However, the attenuating effect on vascular permeability was antagonized by ICI 118,551. Dopexamine prevented a decrease in venular wall shear rate during endotoxemia. This effect was not influenced by ICI 118,551.", 
    "95": "Dopexamine attenuates endotoxin-induced microcirculatory disturbances in rat mesentery. The attenuating effect on vascular permeability is a beta2-adrenoceptor-mediated process, whereas the beta2-adrenoceptor actions of dopexamine play no significant role in attenuating leukocyte adherence.", 
    "96": "Rats were implanted in the striatum with a glucose biosensor glued to a dialysis probe. Changes in extracellular glucose concentration in response to either neuronal stimulation or 3-min periods of hypoxia and hyperoxia were compared when the dialysis probe was perfused with either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) alone or aCSF with the addition of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Propranolol had no effect on basal levels of glucose or the changes in glucose produced by hypoxia and hyperoxia, which are attributed to changes in the utilization of glucose. Following neuronal activation there is an initial reduction followed by a delayed, prolonged increase in glucose which is suppressed by propranolol. The results suggest that propranolol has no effect on glucose utilization, but blocks the delivery of glucose from astrocytes.", 
    "97": "Maternal thyrotoxicosis complicates approximately 0.2% of pregnancies. Simultaneous occurrence of maternal and fetal thyrotoxicosis during labor is rare, and control of maternal tachycardia and hypertension, as well as fetal manifestations of thyrotoxicosis, are cornerstones of management. An 18-year-old nulliparous female at 33 weeks gestational age presented in labor with thyrotoxicosis. Fetal tachycardia was present as well. Labetalol therapy resulted in a decrease in maternal pulse and blood pressure, and resolution of fetal tachycardia. Vaginal delivery occurred. Subsequent evaluation demonstrated neonatal thyrotoxicosis and high maternal titers of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin. In conclusion, labetalol was beneficial in the treatment of maternal and fetal thyrotoxicosis during labor.", 
    "98": "1. Exposure to a combined forced swimming-confinement stress resulted in a decrease in insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA levels in the whole brain (without the cerebellum) and in the isolated brain areas of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. 2. In an effort to elucidate the neurotransmitter systems involved in this stress-induced decrease, animals were injected prior to exposure to the stress, with either propranolol, diazepam, or MK-801. 3. Administration of diazepam or MK-801 did not affect the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA in any of the three brain areas examined. 4. Administration of propranolol prior to the exposure to the stress inhibited the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA in the cerebellum. Propranolol had no such effect in the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus. 5. Our results suggest that in the cerebellum, the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "99": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SB 211475, a metabolite of carvedilol with weak alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonism and antioxidant effect, on myocardial reperfusion injury and infarct size in anesthetized rabbits. The rabbits were subjected to 60 min of regional myocardial ischemia and 180 min of reperfusion. SB 211475 was administered either as 0.3, 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg and compared to vehicle and carvedilol (1 mg/kg) treated animals. The lowest dose of SB 211475 (0.3 mg/kg) did not reduce infarct size compared to vehicle, whereas SB 211475 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg reduced infarct size significantly compared to vehicle (41.2 +/- 2.2% and 40.5 +/- 2.8% vs. 59.1 +/- 3.9%, p < 0.05). Carvedilol reduced infarct size significantly more than SB 211475 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg (28.8 +/- 3.9% vs. 41.2 +/- 2.2% and 40.5 +/- 2.7%, p < 0.05). Carvedilol and SB 211475 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg reduced myeloperoxidase activity to the same extent, indicative of reduced inflammation. Rate-pressure product did not differ between doses of SB 211475. In conclusion, SB 211475 in the two highest doses reduced infarct size by protecting from reperfusion injury, possibly by reduced neutrophil accumulation. The superior cardiac protective effect of carvedilol over SB 211475 are most likely due to its adrenergic pharmacology including non-selective beta- and alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonism.",

Each formulation contained 200 mg metoprolol tartrate/(tablet). In each of the three periods of the trial, one of the formulations was administered under fasting conditions in the morning on 4 consecutive days. Blood for quantification of metoprolol was drawn immediately before the last dose and in selected time intervals thereafter. A sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection was applied for the quantification of metoprolol.

The AUC in the course of one those interval of 24 h (AUCtau), minium steady-state concentration (C(min)ss) and average steady-state concentration (C(av)ss) values for heterozygous individuals were more than twice those of individuals. Significantly higher values for C(max)ss, t1/2, half-value duration (HVD) and mean residence time (MRT) were also observed in heterozygous volunteers. The higher concentrations of metoprolol in heterozygous individuals also had pharmacodynamic consequences, namely, greater heart rate and blood pressure reduction.",

To study the effect of nicotine on the severity of experimental myocardial ischaemia, Langendorff hearts of rabbits (n=7-12 per group) were subjected to 2 h of low-flow ischaemia followed by 1 h of reperfusion. 2. Infusion of nicotine (100 ng ml(-1)) caused only minor changes in non-ischaemic conditions but a significant (P<0.05) increase in end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), loss of creatine kinase (CK) and troponin (TnT) as well as increase in noradrenaline (NA) overflow in reperfused ischaemic hearts. 3. RT PCR was done on total RNA for mRNA expression of the constitutive (COX-1) and inducible cyclooxygenase (COX-2). There was no COX-2 in non-ischaemic hearts but a significant expression in ischaemia (n=5) which was further increased by nicotine. These data were confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting and additionally shown that COX-1 remained unchanged. 4. There was a marked increase in prostacyclin (PGI2) and a 2 fold increase in NA overflow which were both stimulated by nicotine. 5. The aggravating effects of nicotine on myocardial ischaemia (CK release) as well as the expression of COX-2 mRNA were prevented by pretreatment with the beta-blocker pindolol (1 microM). 6. The data demonstrate marked deleterious actions of nicotine in reperfused ischaemic hearts. These actions are probably related to the increase in catecholamine overflow, are beta-receptor-mediated and involve enhanced gene expression of COX-2.",

Intracellular microelectrode recordings were performed to investigate the membrane K+ conductances involved in smooth muscle hyperpolarization of lymphatic vessels in the guinea-pig mesentery. 2. Nitric oxide (NO), released either by the endothelium after acetylcholine (ACh; 10 microM) stimulation or by sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 50-100 microM), hyperpolarized lymphatic smooth muscle. These responses were inhibited with the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazole [4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 10 microM). 3. ACh and SNP-induced hyperpolarizations were inhibited (by about 90%) upon application of the ATP-sensitive K+(K(ATP)) channel blocker, glibenclamide (10 microM), or with 4-aminopyridine (2.5 mM), but were not affected by the Ca2+-activated K+ channels blocker, penitrem A (100 nM). 4. Hyperpolarization caused by the K+ channel opener, cromakalim (0.1-10 microM), isoprenaline (0.1 microM) or forskolin (0.5 microM) were all significantly blocked by glibenclamide. 5. Hyperpolarization evoked by ACh and SNP were inhibited with N-[2-(p-bromociannamylamino)-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide-dich loride (H89, 10 microM), suggesting the involvement of cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA). 6. These results suggest that K(ATP) channels play a central role in lymphatic smooth muscle hyperpolarization evoked by a NO-induced increase in cyclic GMP synthesis, as well as by beta-adrenoceptor-mediated production of cyclic AMP. Interestingly, both pathways lead to K(ATP) channels opening through the activation of PKA.", 
    "105": "Recently, we demonstrated the feasibility of combining improved tumor-to-tissue contrasts and PET imaging for immunoscintigraphic tumor localization using a multistep targeting technique that consists of the administration of an antitumor/antihapten bispecific monoclonal antibody (BS-MAb), a blocker to saturate the antihapten binding sites of the BS-MAb that are still present in the circulation, and a low molecular weight Ga chelate, labeled with positron emitter 68Ga, serving as the hapten. Due to this technique, the biodistribution of the radiolabeled hapten is governed mainly by the binding characteristics of both the antitumor and the antihapten part of the BS-MAb. For a future clinical implementation of the method, we investigated MAb VFF18, which is reactive with the adhesion molecule CD44V6, a tumor-associated antigen, and up-regulated in colon, squamous cell and pancreas carcinoma, and two anti-Ga chelate MAbs, which are highly selective for only one of the two enantiomers (optical isomers) of the inherently racemic Ga chelate.",

From data obtained with each BS-MAb, a similar initial tumor binding of approximately 15.5%i.d./g, but different in vivo half-lives of the corresponding BS-MAb-enantiomer immune complexes, could be estimated. Pretargeting with a mixture of both BS-MAbs followed by the administration of the racemic Ga chelate resulted in the lowest tumor uptake (3.9% +/- 1.5%i.d./g). PET imaging of nude mice with the enantiomeric, as well as with the racemic, 68Ga chelate demonstrated a clear delineation of tumors against blood pool background.",

This study investigated the effects of PA on cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) and proliferation, and the possible involvement of the PLD pathway in EGF effects on [Ca2+]i and proliferation in rat calvarial osteoblastic cells. PA markedly increased [Ca2+]i. This response was unaffected by thapsigargin, which depletes [Ca2+]i pools, blocked by verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, and enhanced by propanolol, an inhibitor of PA-phosphohydrolase. PA also reduced the EGF dependent-[Ca2+]i increase by 60%, while a PLD inhibitor blocked these effects. Furthermore, PA significantly increased cell proliferation (P < 0.05) which was inhibited by verapamil and enhanced by H-7 (PKC inhibitor). The PLD inhibitor significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the EGF-induced increase in proliferation. In summary, PA stimulates rat calvarial osteoblastic cell proliferation and mobilization of [Ca2+]i using extracellular pools, and EGF's mitogenic effect on these cells requires activation of PLD.",

Both arteries and veins constricted in response to A (the estimated effective dose required for half-maximal response (ED50) was 3.3 and 0.2 microM, for arteries and veins, respectively) and NA (estimated ED50 was 1.5 and 0.6 microM, for arteries and veins, respectively), but these effects were abolished when the drugs were given in combination with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker Phe. The responses of arteries and veins to ACh and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist Iso were minor and inconsistent, and were completely abolished when combined with their respective blockers (Atr and Pro, respectively). The ED50 for both A and NA are quite high in relation to normal plasma levels of A and NA in seals. This implies that these vessels (and, hence, the supply of blood to the spleen) primarily are subjected to neurogenic, rather than humoral physiological control.",

Many patients seem to benefit from beta-blockers and their effectiveness has been assessed with repeated tilt tests in asystolic patients as well. However, little is known about the long-term effects of beta-blockers. Preliminary data and isolated reports suggest that in some cases, these agents may actually worsen the clinical outcome or the tilt test response. Three patients are described who experienced worsening of tilt test response with prolonged asystole (19.9, 9 and 5.5 sec respectively) during chronic treatment with beta-blockers in the absence of spontaneous symptoms. At discharge, one patient received a dual-chamber pace-maker combined with metoprolol, another one continued to take metoprolol and enalapril. The third patient refused any further medication.

In every cases, the presenting signs were ischaemic order: one myocardial infarction, three cases of unstable angina and two case of stable angina. On coronary angiography, these muscle bridges involved the left anterior descending artery in all cases. The causal relationships between muscle bridges and myocardial ischaemia are discussed. Among the various factors incriminated, spasm, tachycardia and thrombosis appear to play an important role.

    "123": "To examine the role of norepinephrine receptors in spatial working memory processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), noradrenergic antagonists (yohimbine for alpha2, prazosin for alpha1, and propranolol for beta receptors) were applied iontophoretically to neurons of the dorsolateral PFC in rhesus monkeys that performed an oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task. The ODR task was initiated when the monkeys fixated on a central spot on a computer monitor and consisted of fixation (1 s), cue (1 of 4 peripheral cues, 0.5 s), delay (fixation cue only, 4 s), and go periods. In the go period, the subject made a memory-guided saccade to the target location that was cued before the delay period. I focused on 49 neurons that showed directional delay-period activity, i.e., a sustained increase in activity during the delay period, the magnitude of which varied significantly with the memorized target location. Iontophoretic (usually 50 nA) application of yohimbine, but not prazosin or propranolol, significantly decreased the activities of most of the neurons with directional delay-period activity (n = 41/49, 81%). Furthermore, yohimbine attenuated the sharpness of tuning, examined by a tuning index, of delay-period activity and had a greater attenuating effect on delay-period activity than on background activity. These findings suggest that the activation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors in the dorsolateral PFC plays a modulatory role in neuronal processes for visuospatial working memory.",

Mean decrease of intraocular pressure was significant in both groups. No side effects of xalathane were recorded. In one case there was a slight reddening of the eye and a sensation of discomfort Pilocarpine therapy was associated with miosis in all patients; half of them complained of obscure vision and headache after instillation.

Combination of the drug with other hypotensive agents (pilocarpine + timolol) amplified their hypotensive effects. Long (3 months) follow-up showed that xalathane efficacy is comparable to that of pilocarpine and timolol combination but it is tolerated much better.",

Therapeutic response to beta-1-adrenoblocker kerlon in hypertension was assessed by hemodynamic indices and acute pharmacological test. The effect was found to depend on the initial hemocirculation type. In hyperkinetic hemodynamics lowering of blood pressure was due to diminution of the cardiac index, in eukinetic and hypokinetic types- to a decrease in the total peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "127": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of amiodarone used alone or in combination with propranolol in infants and children affected by life-threatening or drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias. The study included 27 children (median age 3 months), affected by life-threatening and/or drug-resistant supraventricular or ventricular tachyarrhythmias. The loading dose of amiodarone was 10-20 mg/kg/day and the maintenance dose ranged between 3 and 20 mg/kg/day. When amiodarone was ineffective, propranolol was added at a dosage of 2-4 mg/kg/day. The study population was divided into two groups: group A was composed of patients <1 year and group B of patients >1 year. The effectiveness of the therapy was assessed by clinical evaluation, Holter monitoring, exercise testing, and, in patients with reentry tachycardias, electrophysiological testing. Amiodarone used alone was effective or partially effective in 4/14 (28%) patients in group A and in 11/13 (85%) patients in group B (p < 0.006). Among amiodarone-resistant patients, the combined therapy with propranolol was effective in 8/10 patients in group A and 2/2 patients in group B. Therefore, amiodarone used alone or in combination with propranolol was effective in 25/27 (93%) patients. During the follow-up (20.5 +/- 13 months) there were no arrhythmic effects but side effects were noted in 5/27 (18.5%) patients. Amiodarone seems to be an effective drug in the control of the life-threatening and/or drug-resistant supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias in children. The addition of propranolol can significantly enhance the success rate of this class III drug, especially in the treatment of reentry tachycardias due to accessory pathways.",

    "129": "Beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors in heart muscle cells mediate the catecholamine-induced increase in the force and frequency of cardiac contraction. Recently, in addition, we demonstrated the functional expression of beta3-adrenoceptors in the human heart. Their stimulation, in marked contrast with that of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors, induces a decrease in contractility through presently unknown mechanisms. In the present study, we examined the role of a nitric oxide (NO) synthase pathway in mediating the beta3-adrenoceptor effect on the contractility of human endomyocardial biopsies. The negative inotropic effects of a beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37344, and also of norepinephrine in the presence of alpha- and beta1-2-blockade were inhibited both by a nonspecific blocker of NO, methylene blue, and two NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors, L-N-monomethyl-arginine and L-nitroarginine-methyl ester. The effect of the NOS inhibitors was reversed by an excess of L-arginine, the natural substrate of NOS, but not by D-arginine. Moreover, the effects of the beta3-adrenoceptor agonist on contractility were associated with parallel increases in the production of NO and intracellular cGMP, which were also inhibited by NOS inhibitors. Immunohistochemical staining of human ventricular biopsies showed the expression of the endothelial constitutive (eNOS), but not the inducible (iNOS) isoform of NOS in both ventricular myocytes and endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that beta3-adrenoceptor stimulation decreases cardiac contractility through activation of an NOS pathway. Changes in the expression of this pathway may alter the balance between positive and negative inotropic effects of catecholamines on the heart potentially leading to myocardial dysfunction.", 
    "130": "Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized within mammalian sinoatrial cells has been shown to participate in cholinergic control of heart rate (HR). However, it is not known whether NO synthesized within neurons plays a role in HR regulation. HR dynamics were measured in 24 wild-type (WT) mice and 24 mice in which the gene for neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) was absent (nNOS-/- mice). Mean HR and HR variability were compared in subsets of these animals at baseline, after parasympathetic blockade with atropine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), after beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.p.), and after combined autonomic blockade. Other animals underwent pressor challenge with phenylephrine (3 mg/kg i.p.) after beta-adrenergic blockade to test for a baroreflex-mediated cardioinhibitory response. The latter experiments were then repeated after inactivation of inhibitory G proteins with pertussis toxin (PTX) (30 microgram/kg i.p.). At baseline, nNOS-/- mice had higher mean HR (711+/-8 vs. 650+/-8 bpm, P = 0.0004) and lower HR variance (424+/-70 vs. 1,112+/-174 bpm2, P = 0.001) compared with WT mice. In nNOS-/- mice, atropine administration led to a much smaller change in mean HR (-2+/-9 vs. 49+/-5 bpm, P = 0.0008) and in HR variance (64+/-24 vs. -903+/-295 bpm2, P = 0.02) than in WT mice. In contrast, propranolol administration and combined autonomic blockade led to similar changes in mean HR between the two groups. After beta-adrenergic blockade, phenylephrine injection elicited a fall in mean HR and rise in HR variance in WT mice that was partially attenuated after treatment with PTX. The response to pressor challenge in nNOS-/- mice before PTX administration was similar to that in WT mice. However, PTX-treated nNOS-/- mice had a dramatically attenuated response to phenylephrine. These findings suggest that the absence of nNOS activity leads to reduced baseline parasympathetic tone, but does not prevent baroreflex-mediated cardioinhibition unless inhibitory G proteins are also inactivated. Thus, neuronally derived NO and cardiac inhibitory G protein activity serve as parallel pathways to mediate autonomic slowing of heart rate in the mouse.", 
    "131": "Maternal catecholamines increase dramatically in labor because of pain and emotional stress. Because the uterus is richly endowed with both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, catecholamines could alter uterine activity. We assessed the effect of clinically encountered concentrations of these catecholamines on uterine activity and modeled the effect of the abrupt reduction in circulating epinephrine that occurs during effective labor analgesia. Term pregnant rat uteri were excised, and cross-sectional rings were mounted for isometric force recording. Log concentration-response curves for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and their combination on uterine activity were constructed from 10(-12) to 10(-6) M. Catecholamine responses were repeated in the presence of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker or propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker. The abilities of oxytocin and of washout of catecholamines to reverse catecholamine-induced changes in uterine activity were also assessed. Epinephrine caused dose-dependent reductions in uterine activity, blocked by propranolol. Epinephrine concentrations in the clinical range(10(-9) to 10(-8) M; 100-1000 pg/mL) decreased uterine activity to 49.6% +/- 6.6% (mean +/- SE) of control. Norepinephrine caused a dose-dependent increase in uterine activity, which was blocked by phentolamine. In the clinical range (10(-8) M), uterine activity was 139.2% +/- 13.40% of control. The combination of both catecholamines, however, was nearly as tocolytic as epinephrine alone. Oxytocin antagonized catecholamine-induced tocolysis, and washout of epinephrine or both catecholamines increased uterine activity. We conclude that mixed catecholamines are significantly tocolytic at concentrations encountered in laboring women. In this in vitro model, reduction in epinephrine concentration, comparable to that which occurs during effective analgesia, significantly increases uterine activity.",

    "140": "A large number of pharmaceutically active compounds have a high affinity to acidic phospholipids; good examples are the cationic compounds lidocaine, propranolol, and gentamycin. These drugs influenced the lipid dynamics of liposomes composed of phosphatidylcholine and the acidic phosphatidylglycerol, as judged by the excimer/monomer emission intensity ratio for a pyrene-labeled phospholipid analog, as well as by polarization of DPH fluorescence. When the mole fraction X of PG (XPG) was 0.20, lidocaine increased membrane fluidity. The opposite was true for propranolol, which caused the formation of pyrene lipid-enriched microdomains. Gentamycin had no apparent effect. At XPG = 1.00, all these drugs rigidified membrane. Subsequently, we investigated the detachment of a cationic peripheral membrane protein, cytochrome c (cyt c), by these compounds from liposomes. This was accomplished by monitoring resonance energy transfer from a pyrene-labeled phospholipid to the heme of cyt c. The efficiency of the above compounds to dissociate cyt c varied considerably. In brief, significantly lower concentrations of gentamycin than propranolol or lidocaine were required for half-maximal dissociation of cyt c from liposomes, although the final extent of protein detachment by gentamycin was less complete. ATP augmented the dissociation of cyt c from membranes by lidocaine and propranolol. Stopped-flow measurements also revealed that the half-times differed for the release of cyt c from the membranes. Our results are likely to reflect differences in the contributions of the electrostatic interactions and hydrophobicity to the drug/lipid interaction and comply with two different acidic phospholipid binding sites in cyt c.",

The addition of a single dose of anticholinergic to beta2 agonist did not reduce hospital admission (relative risk 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.32). However, significant group differences in lung function supporting the combination treatment were observed 60 minutes (standardised mean difference -0.57, -0.93 to -0.21) and 120 minutes (-0.53, -0.90 to -0.17) after the dose of anticholinergic. In contrast, the addition of multiple doses of anticholinergics to beta2 agonists, mainly in children and adolescents with severe exacerbations, reduced the risk of hospital admission by 30% (relative risk 0.72, 0.53 to 0.99). Eleven (95% confidence interval 5 to 250) children would need to be treated to avoid one admission. A parallel improvement in lung function (standardised mean difference -0.66, -0.95 to -0.37) was noted 60 minutes after the last combined inhalation.

Carvedilol was absorbed well, and biliary secretion was predominant in each species. Carvedilol was metabolized extensively in each species, and elimination of unchanged compound was minor in bile duct-catheterized rats and dogs. In dogs, glucuronidation of the parent compound and hydroxylation of the carbazolyl ring, with subsequent glucuronidation, were the major metabolic pathways. Rats showed the simplest metabolite profile; the primary metabolites were formed by hydroxylation of the carbazolyl ring, with subsequent glucuronidation. Mice displayed the most complicated metabolite profile; glucuronidation of the parent compound and hydroxylation of either the carbazolyl or phenyl ring, with subsequent glucuronidation, were the major metabolic routes.

    "156": "Previous work indicated that hyperstimulation of muscarinic receptors brings about profound changes not only in the density of the muscarinic receptors, but also of the beta-adrenoceptors in rat heart atria in vivo. We have now investigated whether a similar receptor cross-regulation occurs in cardiomyocytes in vitro. Cardiomyocytes from 3-4 day old rats were exposed to chemical agents on days 5-6 in culture. Densities of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors were measured according to the binding of N-[3H]methylscopolamine and [ H]CGP 12177, respectively, to cell surface membranes and cell homogenates. Exposure of cells to the muscarinic agonist carbachol (1 mmol/l) brought about a profound decrease in the number of muscarinic receptors. The number of beta-adrenoceptors displayed biphasic changes, being augmented after 24 h (by 20-45% on the cell surface and by 29% in the homogenate) and diminished after 48 h and 72 h (after 48 h, decrease by 44-75% on the cell surface and by 36% in the homogenate). These effects of carbachol were not prevented by dimethylaminopropyl-bis-indolylmaleimide, the inhibitor of protein kinase C. Exposure of cells to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (0.1 mmol/l) strongly diminished the number of beta-adrenoceptors on the cell surface and in the homogenate. The density of muscarinic receptors on the cell surface was diminished by 24-43% after 24 h exposure to isoprenaline and unchanged after 48 h, whereas the concentration of muscarinic receptors in the homogenate was unchanged after 24 h and increased by 20% after 48 h. The isoprenaline-induced decrease in the density of cell surface muscarinic receptors could not be simulated by forskolin and was not abolished by the protein kinase A inhibitors Rp-cAMPS and HA-1004. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP diminished the density of cell surface muscarinic receptors more than that of the beta-adrenergic receptors. Our data reveal a novel phenomenon of a biphasic change (an increase followed by a loss) in the density of beta-adrenoceptors during exposure of cardiocytes to carbachol. Activation of beta-adrenoceptors brings about less conspicuous changes in the density of muscarinic receptors. The observed phenomena of receptor cross-regulation cannot be explained by simple activations of protein kinases A and C.", 
    "157": "To clarify the mechanism of the species difference in the metabolism of bisoprolol enantiomers, in vitro metabolic studies were performed using dog liver microsomes and human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms. The O-deisopropylation of bisoprolol enantiomers showed biphasic kinetics in dog liver microsomes. The intrinsic clearance (Vmax/Km) for O-deisopropylation of R(+)-bisoprolol was higher than S(-)-isomer in both high-affinity and low-affinity components. The R/S ratio of the intrinsic clearance in high- and low-affinity components was 1.34 and 1.65, respectively. The inhibition studies in dog liver microsomes using CYP isoform-selective inhibitors indicated that the O-deisopropylation of both bisoprolol enantiomers was mediated via the CYP2D and CYP3A subfamily, and suggested that high-affinity oxidation was dependent on CYP2D. The kinds of CYP subfamilies in dogs, which contribute to the metabolism of bisoprolol enantiomers, were the same as those in humans. The intrinsic clearance for O-deisopropylation of R(+)bisoprolol by human recombinant CYP2D6 was also different from that of S(-)-enantiomers (R/S:1.50). However, unlike the dog microsomes, the intrinsic clearance by the human recombinant CYP3A4 did not show a stereoselective difference. Therefore, the species difference in the R/S ratio of metabolic clearance for the oxidation of bisoprolol enantiomers (dog > human) is mainly due to the species difference in the stereoselectivity of one of the cytochrome P450 subfamilies (CYP3A).",

Stripped epithelial sheets were mounted in Ussing chambers connected to an automatic voltage current clamp and changes in the short circuit current (microA/cm2) were measured continuously as an index of electrogenic ion transfer. Dopamine (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration dependent decrease in Isc with an EC50 of 1.4+/-0.1 microM: the effect of dopamine was not changed by propranolol (1 microM), prazosin (1 microM and 10 microM) or (+/-)-sulpiride (1 microM). but was completely abolished by phentolamine (1 microM). The addition of phentolamine (0.3 microM) or yohimbine (0.3 microM) produced a rightward shift of the dopamine concentration-dependent curve with an increase in EC50 values up to 30.0+/-0.2 microM and 11.7+/-0.1 microM. respectively. The alpha2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, UK14,304 (5-bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine), also produced a concentration-dependent decrease in Isc with an EC50 of 0.04+/-0.01 microM; the addition of yohimbine (0.3 microM) increased the EC50 value of UK14,304 to 0.68+/-0.01 microM. The addition of amiloride (100 microM), a Na+ channel blocker, to the fluid bathing the apical side was found not to change the effect of dopamine on Isc. 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (10 microM), a selective Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor, partially antagonised the effect produced by 100 microM of dopamine. The addition of ouabain (1 mM) to the fluid bathing the basal side, antagonised the effect produced by 50 and 100 microM of dopamine. In contrast, frusemide (1 mM) completely abolished the effect of all concentrations of dopamine. Forskolin (10 microM) and N6,2'-O-dibutyryl cyclic AMP (1 mM) added to both the apical and serosal sides completely abolished the effect of dopamine on Isc. It is concluded that the dopamine antisecretory effects in the jejunum of adult rats are mediated through alpha2-adrenoceptors. This effect is sensitive to increases in intracellular cyclic AMP and is primarily dependent on the basal Na+,K+,2Cl- -co-transport mechanism.", 
    "167": "Power spectral analysis (PSA) of the variation in heart rate is useful in determining the relative activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. In this study, PSA was used to investigate the relationship between abnormalities in autonomic nerve function and the presence of thyroid disorders in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases. The low frequency (LF) or high frequency (HF) components of R-R variations were determined by PSA. The coefficient of variation of the R-R time intervals (CV(R-R)) was positively correlated with HF in healthy subjects. In untreated hyperthyroid patients with Graves' disease, the CV(R-R) and HF values were significantly lower than in healthy controls. Moreover, the LF/HF ratio in patients with untreated Graves' disease was significantly higher, and the LF/HF ratio in hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis was significantly lower than in healthy controls. A negative correlation was observed between serum levels of free thyroid hormones (FT4 and FT3) and HF in Graves' disease patients. In some hyperthyroid patients, antithyroid drug therapy or beta-blocker administration gradually restored reduced HF values. Present results suggest that relative vagal nerve activity is reduced in hyperthyroid patients and that this reduction is reversible according to the decrease in serum levels of thyroid hormones.",

A CE-ESI-MS interface linking a manually operated CE system and a Finnigan MAT-900 sector mass spectrometer (with an Analytica electrospray ionization source) has been constructed in-house and employed for this study. Although a water/methanol based capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) buffer was initially used to determine these analytes, enhanced resolution was obtained by addition of a polymerized surfactant, i.e., poly-sodium undecylenic sulfate (poly-SUS), into the electrokinetic chromatography (EKC) buffer. When a low concentration of this poly-SUS surfactant was added to a volatile EKC buffer, these structurally similar cationic drugs were EKC separated and on-line detected by ESI-MS."
