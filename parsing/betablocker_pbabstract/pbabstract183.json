In the Pro group, blood flow reduction by acetylcholine and left anterior descending coronary artery diameter reduction by serotonin did not change compared with those of the ED group. In the Meto group however, blood flow reduction by acetylcholine (week 8, -70+/-16%) and left anterior descending coronary artery diameter reduction by serotonin (week 8, -64+/-15%) were blunted (P<0.01) compared with those of ED and Pro groups.",

    "4": "Beta-blockers are used commonly worldwide in clinical practice for lowering blood pressure. Most of the agents in this class are efficacious in reducing blood pressure, although they vary widely in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. This variability may confer significant differences in clinical benefits associated with use of specific agents. Although commonly used in managing hypertension, the role of beta-blockers for primary prevention in uncomplicated hypertension has been controversial. Evidence from recent trials suggest relatively poor efficacy toward primary prevention and worse outcomes for certain end points, when compared with other blood pressure-lowering agents, Recently updated National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for England and Wales reflect this concern and have changed the indication for beta-blockers for blood pressure control from primary agents to use as an add-on agent in patients requiring multiple therapy. In this review, considering the extended debate on this topic, we discuss the general properties of beta-blockers and evidence from clinical trials supporting or refuting their use in various clinical scenarios. Newer beta-blockers have additional properties which may be beneficial. Although, whether these additional benefits will help in primary prevention is not clear.", 
    "5": "EGb 761, a standardized form of Ginkgo biloba L. (Ginkgoaceae) leaf extract, was recently reported to increase pancreatic beta-cell function. To determine whether EGb 761 elicits insulin secretion directly, we treated INS-1 rat beta cells with EGb 761 and then measured insulin release. Treatment of EGb 761 (50 microg/ml) significantly stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 cells, compared with untreated control (p<0.05) and the stimulatory effect of EGb 761 on insulin secretion was dose-dependent. To elucidate the mechanism of EGb 761-induced insulin secretion, we investigated the involvement of calcium. The treatment with nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, prevented EGb 761-induced insulin secretion and furthermore, EGb 761 itself elevated [Ca(2+)](i), suggesting the involvement of calcium in this process. To identity the protein kinases involved in EGb 761-induced insulin secretion, INS-1 cells were treated with different kinase inhibitors and their effects on EGb 761-induced secretion were investigated. KN62 and H89, calium/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) II and protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, respectively, significantly reduced EGb 761-induced insulin secretion. Immunoblotting studies showed an increase in the phosphorylated-forms of CaMK II and of PKA substrates after EGb 761 treatment. Our data suggest that EGb 761-induced insulin secretion is mediated by [Ca(2+)](i) elevation and subsequent activation of CaMK II and PKA.",

    "15": "The objective of the present study was to investigate and quantify the effects of ibuprofen, chlorpheniramine maleate and metoprolol tartrate on the thermal, mechanical and diffusional properties of polyacrylate-based films. Thin drug-containing films were prepared from organic Eudragit RS solutions and physicochemically characterized with respect to their glass transition temperature, mechanical properties and drug release kinetics in phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The apparent diffusion coefficient of the drug within the polymeric systems was determined by fitting an adequate solution of Fick's second law of diffusion to the experimentally determined release profiles. Importantly, the glass transition temperature of the films significantly decreased with increasing initial drug content, whereas the film flexibility and drug release rate increased. This clearly indicates that the three drugs act as efficient plasticizers for Eudragit RS. Interestingly, the mathematical analysis revealed that drug release was primarily controlled by diffusion. An increase in the initial drug content resulted in increased drug diffusivities and, thus, accelerated (absolute and relative) drug release rates. Importantly, quantitative relationships could be established between the drug diffusivity and the initial drug content. Based on this knowledge, the effects of the films' composition and thickness on the resulting drug release kinetics (also from coated solid dosage forms) can be predicted in a quantitative way.",

Insulin resistance, a common comorbidity in heart failure patients, and medical therapy may modify myocardial metabolism in complex fashions.

Echocardiography was used to assess myocardial function, work, and efficiency of forward work. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA index) and the degree of beta-blockade was estimated with a beta-adrenoceptor occupancy test. IDCM patients were characterized by decreased cardiac efficiency (35 +/- 2 versus 57 +/- 12 mm Hg.L.g(-1), P < .0001) and reduced myocardial FFA uptake (5.5 +/- 2.0 versus 6.4 +/- 1.2 mumol.100 g(-1).min(-1), P < .05), but the FFA beta-oxidation rate constant was not changed. In the patients, myocardial FFA uptake was inversely associated with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (r = -0.63, P < .01), indicating that further depression of LV function induces an opposite switch to greater FFA uptake. The FFA beta-oxidation rate constant correlated positively with the HOMA index (r = 0.53, P < .05). In patients on beta-1 selective beta-blockers, beta-1 adrenoceptor occupancy correlated inversely with LV work, oxidative metabolism, and FFA uptake; similar relationships were not found in patients on nonselective beta-blocker.",

When basal BGL was <120 mg/dl it dropped to <70 mg/dl in 8/34 sessions. There was a possibility of lowered BGL when basal BGL was <170 mg/dl and a marked reduction in BGL occurred when basal BGL was <120 mg/dl.

    "23": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Other symptoms associated with the disease are goitre, ophthalmopathy, and psychiatric manifestations such as mood and anxiety disorders and, sometimes, cognitive dysfunction. Graves' hyperthyroidism may result in these latter manifestations via the induction of hyperactivity of the adrenergic nervous system. This review addresses the psychiatric presentations, and their pathophysiology and treatment, in patients with hyperthyroidism, based on literature identified by a PubMed/MEDLINE database search. Although the focus is on mental symptoms associated with Graves' disease, it is not always clear from the literature whether patients had Graves' disease: in some studies, the patients were thought to have Graves' disease based on clinical findings such as diffuse goitre or ophthalmopathy or on measurements of thyroid antibodies in serum; however, in other studies, no distinction was made between Graves' hyperthyroidism and hyperthyroidism from other causes. Antithyroid drugs combined with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are the treatments of choice for hyperthyroidism, as well as for the psychiatric disorders and mental symptoms caused by hyperthyroidism. A substantial proportion of patients have an altered mental state even after successful treatment of hyperthyroidism, suggesting that mechanisms other than hyperthyroidism, including the Graves' autoimmune process per se and ophthalmopathy, may also be involved. When psychiatric disorders remain after restoration of euthyroidism and after treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, specific treatment for the psychiatric symptoms, especially psychotropic drugs, may be needed.",

EAE was characterized by ventriculomegaly, decreased apparent diffusion coefficient, and decreased (phosphocreatine + beta-adenosine triphosphate)/inorganic phosphate ratio. Reduced apparent diffusion coefficient and impaired energy metabolism indicate astrocytic edema. Intracerebroventricularly BgK-F6A-treated rats showed attenuated clinical EAE with unexpectedly reduced ventriculomegaly and preserved apparent diffusion coefficient values and (phosphocreatine + beta-adenosine triphosphate)/inorganic phosphate ratio. Thus, under BgK-F6A treatment, brain damage was dramatically reduced and energy metabolism maintained.",

The present study was designed to determine the role of the sympathetic nervous system in mediating plasma ADM changes during handgrip in patients with HF. Twelve male HF patients (II class NYHA) treated with carvedilol, a non-selective adrenergic blocker (TC) and 12 patients untreated with carvedilol (UC) performed two 3-min bouts of static handgrip at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction, alternately with each hand. At the end of both exercise bouts and in 5 min of the recovery period, plasma ADM and catecholamines were determined. In addition, heart rate, blood pressure and stroke volume (SV) were measured. The baseline plasma ADM, noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) levels were similar in the two groups of patients, while SV was higher (P<0.05) in TC than in UC. During exercise plasma ADM concentrations were lower (P<0.05) in TC than in UC, but the handgrip-induced increases in plasma ADM did not differ between the groups. Plasma ADM correlated with NA concentrations (r = 0.764) and with SV (r = -0.435) and increases in plasma ADM expressed as percentage of baseline values correlated with those of plasma NA (r = 0.499), diastolic BP (r = 0.550) and total peripheral resistance (r = 0.435). The study suggests that the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in the stimulation of ADM secretion during static exercise either directly or by changes in the haemodynamic response.",

To control the blood pressure (BP), remifentanil up to 1 microg.kg(-1).min(-1) infusion rate, sodium nitroprusside, and esmolol infusions were administered successfully. Following the ligation of the adrenal veins, hemodynamic parameters were stable and neither inotropic support nor corticosteroid replacement was required. We concluded that remifentanil-based anesthesia combined with low-dose desflurane and thoracic epidural analgesia may reduce the need for vasoactive drugs in the anesthesia management of pheochromocytoma. This combination may not prevent the hemodynamic fluctuations during tumor manipulation, but appears to facilitate a rapid and stable postoperative recovery.",

Continuous BP measurements obtained in mice by telemetry were used to characterize the spectral bandwidths of autonomic relevance by using an approach with no a priori. The paradigm was based on the autonomic blockades obtained with conventional drugs (atropine, prazosin, atenolol). The spectral changes were estimated in all of the combinations of spectral bandwidths. The effect of hydralazine was also tested using the same systematic analysis, to detect the zones of sympathetic activation resulting reflexly from the vasodilatory action of the drug. Two zones of interest in the study of the autonomic control of BP and HR were observed. The first zone covered the 0.15-0.60 Hz range of the systolic BP spectrum and corresponds to the low-frequency zone (or Mayer waves). This zone reflects sympathetic control since the power spectral density of this zone was significantly reduced with alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade (prazosin), while it was significantly amplified as a result of a reflex sympathetic activation (hydralazine). The second zone covered the 2.5-5.0 Hz range of the pulse interval spectrum and corresponded to the high-frequency zone (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) under vagal control (blocked by atropine). These zones are recommended for testing the autonomic control of circulation in mice.", 
    "46": "Hypertension promotes left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and myocardial remodeling and is frequently present in patients with systolic or diastolic heart failure. Control of hypertension in both of these settings may attenuate progressive LV hypertrophy and remodeling and improve clinical outcomes. Guidelines for the management of heart failure recommend that hypertension should be treated in all patients with preclinical heart failure as well as in those with heart failure with reduced or preserved LV systolic function. Consistent with national hypertension guidelines, the goal for blood pressure control in hypertensive patients with heart failure is less than 140/90 mm Hg, but lower targets (< 130/80 mm Hg) may be desirable in those with concomitant diabetes mellitus or renal disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists are first-line options for hypertension treatment in heart failure. Calcium channel antagonists and the alpha blocker doxazosin should be avoided. Episodes of recurrent pulmonary edema and hypertension may also indicate underlying severe renovascular disease that may respond to percutaneous renal artery intervention.",

Based on the individual clinical situation, principally all antihypertensive drugs recommended by the current European guidelines, may be prescribed as mono- or combination therapy.beta-receptor blockers are especially capable of controlling excessive exercise-induced blood pressure increase; however, they have metabolic and exercise physiological limitations.

Mechanisms that maintain the wasting process involve neurohormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute to an imbalance in anabolic and catabolic pathways. A decrease in food intake alone rarely triggers the development of a wasting process, but dietary deficiencies in micronutrients and macronutrients contribute to the progression of the disease. Malabsorption from the gut as a result of bowel wall edema and decreased bowel perfusion also plays an important role. This article describes the complex interplay of hormonal systems in energy balance in patients with chronic heart failure as well as other factors such as malabsorption and dietary deficiencies that contribute to the wasting process. Finally, therapeutic approaches are discussed. These include dietary advice, ongoing studies, and future possibilities.",

Baseline heart rate, heart rate at 40% and 70% peak O2 consumption, and maximal exercise were significantly blunted more by metoprolol tartrate than by carvedilol (P<.05 for all). Peak O2 consumption was significantly reduced by metoprolol tartrate (P<.03) but not by carvedilol (P=.054). The change in O2 consumption was significantly correlated with the degree of beta1-blockade (r =0.45; P<.05).

For this purpose the vasodilatory effect of the non-conventional partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist cyanopindolol was examined. Cyanopindolol (1-300 microM), studied in the presence of the beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, relaxed the human pulmonary artery preconstricted with serotonin 1 microM in a concentration-dependent manner (maximally by about 80%). This effect was diminished by bupranolol 10 microM (an antagonist of beta(1)-beta(3)-adrenoceptors and the low affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor) and CGP 20712 10 microM (known to antagonize the low-affinity state of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor at high concentrations). In further experiments, the effect of beta-adrenoceptor ligands on the serotonin-induced vasoconstriction was examined. The concentration-response curve for serotonin was not affected by cyanopindolol 30 microM, bupranolol 10 microM and CGP 20712 10 microM but shifted to the right by cyanopindolol 100 and 300 microM; the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin 0.3 microM abolished the maximum contraction elicited by serotonin. In conclusion, the present study reveals that the vasodilatory effect of cyanopindolol in the human pulmonary artery consists of two components, i.e. activation of a propranolol-insensitive atypical beta-adrenoceptor and antagonism against 5-HT(2A) receptors.", 
    "56": "Diabetes mellitus adversely affects the outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction (MI), due in part to the exacerbation of left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of heart failure, information about the potential benefits of ARB on advanced LV failure associated with diabetes is lacking. To induce diabetes, male mice were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (200 mg/kg). At 2 weeks, anterior MI was created by ligating the left coronary artery. These animals received treatment with olmesartan (0.1 mg/kg/day; n = 50) or vehicle (n = 51) for 4 weeks. Diabetes worsened the survival and exaggerated echocardiographic LV dilatation and dysfunction in MI. Treatment of diabetic MI mice with olmesartan significantly improved the survival rate (42% versus 27%, P < 0.05) without affecting blood glucose, arterial blood pressure, or infarct size. It also attenuated LV dysfunction in diabetic MI. Likewise, olmesartan attenuated myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and the number of apoptotic cells in the noninfarcted LV from diabetic MI. Post-MI LV remodeling and failure in diabetes were ameliorated by ARB, providing further evidence that angiotensin II plays a pivotal role in the exacerbated heart failure after diabetic MI.", 
    "57": "We obtained a new mutant of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor (beta(1)-AR) by point mutations that can constitutively activate beta(1)-AR. Aspartate104 of the beta(1)-AR in the 2nd transmembrane was replaced with alanine. The beta(1)-AR mutant expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells displayed high level of constitutive activity with respect to wild-type (P<0.05), which could be partially inhibited by some beta-blockers. The constitutive activity of the mutant was confirmed by the finding that the enhanced activity is dependent on the level of receptor expression. The results of this study might have interesting implications for future studies aiming at elucidating the activation process of the beta(1)-AR as well as the mechanism of action of beta-blockers.",

    "62": "Haloperidol, a dopamine D2 receptor blocker, is a classical neuroleptic drug that elicits extrapyramidal symptoms. Its metabolites include 3-(4-fluorobenzoyl) propionic acid (FBPA) and 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-piperidinol (CPHP). Until now, the biological significance of these metabolites has remained largely unknown. Here, we report that the administration of FBPA to mice effected a suppression of locomotor activity and induced catalepsy in a manner similar to that observed with haloperidol, whereas CPHP had no significant effects. Neither of these two metabolites, however, exhibited any ability to bind to the dopamine D2 receptor. FBPA blocked dopamine-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and it specifically affected mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)1/2 activity in hippocampal HN33 cells. Moreover, FBPA was capable of direct interaction with MEK1/2, and inhibited its activity in vitro. We demonstrated the generation of haloperidol metabolites within haloperidol-treated cells by mass spectrometric analyses. Collectively, our results confirm the biological activity of FBPA, and provide initial clues as to the receptor-independent role of haloperidol.", 
    "63": "We have compared the ability of three radioligands, [(125)I]-cyanopindolol, [(3)H]-CGP 12,177 and [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol, to label the three human beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. Saturation and competition binding experiments were performed using membrane preparations from Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the three subtypes. While [(3)H]-CGP 12,177 had very similar affinity for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors (about 40 pM), [(125)I]-cyanopindolol and [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol had 4- to 6-fold higher affinity for beta(2)- as compared to beta(1)-adrenoceptors (10 vs 45 and 187 vs 1,021 pM, respectively). The affinity of [(125)I]-cyanopindolol at beta(3)-adrenoceptors was considerably lower (440 pM) than at the other two subtypes. The beta(3)-adrenoceptor affinity of [(3)H]-CGP 12,177 and [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol was so low that it could not be estimated within the tested range of radioligand concentrations (up to 4,000 pM and 30,000 pM for [(3)H]-CGP 12,177 and [(3)H]-dihydroalprenolol, respectively). We conclude that all three radioligands are ill-suited to label beta(3)-adrenoceptors, particularly in preparations co-expressing multiple subtypes. In the absence of alternatives, [(125)I]-cyanopindolol appears the least unsuitable to label beta(3)-adrenoceptors. There is a need for high-affinity radioligands which are either selective for beta(3)-adrenoceptors or reasonably non-selective among all three beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.", 
    "64": "Many antihypertensive drugs have important interactions with drugs used for different purposes; when these are used concomitantly, adverse effects on blood pressure can result. Fortunately, in recent years, the drug development process has generally discouraged the approval and marketing of antihypertensive drugs with this problem, although some anomalies still exist (eg, telmisartan + digoxin). Physicians who work in emergency departments are more familiar with illicit or unregulated drugs that affect blood pressure; chief among these are cocaine and other opioids, and methylphenidate and its congeners. The most important prescription drugs that affect blood pressure are the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including selective inhibitors of the second isoform of cyclooxygenase) and steroids. Phenylpropanolamines, some antidepressants, and sibutramine can often be avoided, as they raise blood pressure in a significant proportion of those who take them. Conversely, the hypertensive effects of calcineurin inhibitors and erythropoietin are most commonly overcome by increasing the intensity of antihypertensive drug treatment, since these drugs are essentially unavoidable in most patients who receive them.",

This study was undertaken to determine whether Maine physicians initiating monotherapy for newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from 2001-2005 used this guideline. The Maine Medicaid database was searched for the drug classes used to initiate monotherapy for patients followed for at least 6 months. A total of 5373 patients were included. In 2001, the use of beta-blockers was 23.5%, diuretics 17.5%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 37.5%, calcium channel blockers 9.5%, angiotensin receptor blockers 3.8%, and others 8.2%. By 2005, the use of beta-blockers was 27.8%, diuretics 25.5%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 30.9%, calcium channel blockers 6.4%, angiotensin receptor blockers 1.6%, and others 7.7%. There was an increase in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in diabetics but no other condition affected drug choice. Although there was an increase in the use of diuretics as initial therapy in 2003 and 2004, this decreased in 2005. The increase in initial diuretic use was not reflected in patterns of ongoing antihypertensive use from 1997 to 2005.

Furthermore, the role of antiplatelet agents in heart failure remains unclear. This review will focus on platelet activation and the role of platelet dysfunction in heart failure, with particular regard to pathophysiology and outcome. The effects of heart failure therapeutics on platelet function and antiplatelet therapy in heart failure will also be discussed.", 
    "67": "We examined the effect of chronic (15 days) administration of antihypertensive agents, from different pharmacologic classes, on arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate variability in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive (2K1C) rats. The 2K1C rats received by gavage one of the following: water, ramipril, losartan, atenolol, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide. Sham-operated normotensive rats received water. After 15 days of treatment AP was continuously sampled from an indwelling catheter in awake rats during a 2-h period and systolic AP and pulse interval (PI) were submitted to autoregressive spectral analysis with oscillatory components quantified in low (LF: 0.25 to 0.75 Hz) and high (HF: 0.75 to 3.0 Hz) frequency bands. The AP measured by tail-cuff was 170 +/- 2 mm Hg in 2K1C and 131 +/- 3 mm Hg in normotensive rats. Pooled data indicated that all antihypertensive agents reduced the AP of 2K1C rats to 127 +/- 2 mm Hg, whereas 2K1C rats treated with water remained hypertensive (206 +/- 11 mm Hg). Variance of systolic AP was found increased in 2K1C rats treated with water (34 +/- 2 mm Hg2), whereas 2K1C rats treated with ramipril, atenolol, amlodipine, or hydrochlorothiazide presented AP variance similar to normotensive rats (16 +/- 2 mm Hg2). Losartan normalized AP of 2K1C rats but variance of systolic AP remained increased (34 +/- 7 mm Hg2). The 2K1C rats treated with water had increased LF of systolic AP, whereas 2K1C rats treated with losartan showed higher LF of systolic AP and PI. Atenolol presented lower LF and higher HF of PI. In conclusion, losartan normalized AP but did not reduce AP variability, suggesting an autonomic imbalance characterized by higher sympathetic modulation of the cardiovascular system.", 
    "68": "We investigated the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms -1, -2 and -3 in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) in an experimental rat model of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) before and after treatment with timolol, to assess whether its neuroprotective action is associated with the activity of these enzymes. Episcleral vein cauterization in unilateral eyes of Wistar rats was performed to produce elevated IOP. Histological sections of retina and ONH from animals with normal IOP, with elevated IOP, and elevated IOP treated with timolol, were studied by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to NOS-1, NOS-2, and NOS-3. In the control rats, NOS-1 was localized to photoreceptor inner segments, amacrine cells and bipolar cells in the retina, and in astrocytes, pericytes and vascular nitrergic terminals in the ONH. NOS-3 immunostaining localized to the endothelial cells. The rats with elevated IOP showed increased expression of NOS-1 in the plexiform layers of the retina and reactive astrocytes in the ONH. These cells also showed NOS-2 positivity. The rats treated with timolol showed reduced expression of NOS-1 in the retina and ONH. NOS-2 was only detected in a few groups of astrocytes in the ONH. NOS-3 was unchanged in both elevated IOP and timolol-treated groups. These results show that excessive levels of NO synthesized by the NOS-1 and -2 isoforms, considered neurotoxic, might contribute to the progressive lesions of retinal ganglion cell axons. Their reduction after treatment suggests a possible neuroprotective effect of timolol in neurons exposed to excessive amounts of NO.",

Clinical guidelines recommend that most survivors of AMIs without contraindications should receive long-term treatment with beta blockade. Beta blockers have been shown to reduce mortality and reinfarction after AMI, but the pharmacologic differences among beta blockers may affect their ability to reduce these adverse events. The beta blocker carvedilol has adjunctive pharmacologic properties, including alpha1-blocking, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiarrhythmic activities that appear to underlie the outcomes demonstrated in experimental models and clinical trials.

In the HPLC method, the separation of bevantolol enantiomers was performed on a Chiralpak AD-H column by isocratic elution with n-hexane-ethanol-diethylamine (10:90:0.1, v/v/v) as mobile phase. In the CE method, bevantolol enantiomers were separated on an uncoated fused silica capillary with 50 mM amonium phosphate dibasic adjusted to a pH 6.5 with phosphoric acid containing 15 mM CM-beta-CD as running buffer. Validation data such as linearity, recovery, detection limit, and precision of the two methods are presented. The detection limits of S-(-)-bevantolol were 0.1% and 0.05% for CE and HPLC method, respectively and R-(+)-bevantolol were 0.15% and 0.05% for CE and HPLC method, respectively. There was generally good agreement between the HPLC and CE results.", 
    "80": "The study tested the hypothesis that estrogen controls epithelial paracellular resistance through modulation of myosin. The objective was to understand how estrogen modulates nonmuscle myosin-II-B (NMM-II-B), the main component of the cortical actomyosin in human epithelial cervical cells. Experiments used human cervical epithelial cells CaSki as a model, and end points were NMM-II-B phosphorylation, filamentation, and MgATPase activity. The results were as follows: 1) treatment with estrogen increased phosphorylation and MgATPase activity and decreased NMM-II-B filamentation; 2) estrogen effects could be blocked by antisense nucleotides for the estrogen receptor-alpha and by ICI-182,780, tamoxifen, and the casein kinase-II (CK2) inhibitor, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-(D)-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole and attenuated by AG1478 and PD98059 (inhibitors of epithelial growth factor receptor and ERK/MAPK) but not staurosporine [blocker of protein kinase C (PKC)]; 3) treatments with the PKC activator sn-1,2-dioctanoyl diglyceride induced biphasic effect on NMM-II-B MgATPase activity: an increase at 1 nm to 1 microM and a decrease in activity at more than 1 microM; 4) sn-1,2-dioctanoyl diglyceride also decreased NMM-II-B filamentation in a monophasic and saturable dose dependence (EC(50) 1-10 microM); 5) when coincubated directly with purified NMM-II-B filaments, both CK2 and PKC decreased filamentation and increased MgATPase activity; 6) assays done on disassembled NMM-II-B filaments showed MgATPase activity in filaments obtained from estrogen-treated cells but not estrogen-depleted cells; and 7) incubations in vitro with CK2, but not PKC, facilitated MgATPase activity, even in disassembled NMM-II-B filaments. The results suggest that estrogen, in an effect mediated by estrogen receptor-alpha and CK2 and involving the epithelial growth factor receptor and ERK/MAPK cascades, increases NMM-II-B MgATPase activity independent of NMM-II-B filamentation status.", 
    "81": "Adherence to a complex medical regimen in patients with chronic heart failure is an important problem. In the Medicare population, patients with heart failure take an average of 7-8 distinct medications that require >11 separate doses on a daily basis. Nonadherence to these regimens accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Simplification of the medical regimen for patients with heart failure is likely to be associated with improved adherence and, in parallel, may lead to greater satisfaction and potentially improved outcomes. Therefore, the Compliance and Quality of Life Study Comparing Once-Daily Controlled-Release Carvedilol CR and Twice-Daily Immediate-Release Carvedilol IR in Patients with Heart Failure (CASPER) trial has been designed to rigorously test the hypothesis that a once-daily formulation of carvedilol will result in better compliance and increased patient satisfaction relative to the twice-daily formulation.

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in subjects with stable chronic heart failure will compare the change in LVEF in patients receiving carvedilol IR with those receiving carvedilol CR. LVEF will be measured by 2-dimensional echocardiography at 6 months after entry into the maintenance period of the study drug. The secondary objectives of this study are to assess changes in left ventricular remodeling and function, to evaluate changes in brain natriuretic peptide levels, and to determine the incidence of all-cause and heart failure-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality after treatment with carvedilol CR or carvedilol IR.",

Previous trials have demonstrated that although all beta-blockers effectively reduce blood pressure, there are differences in how they affect various metabolic factors. In 2 trials, a novel controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol will be tested against other selective beta-blockers to determine whether differences exist in their individual effects on cardiovascular risk factors.

    "84": "We compared the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of repeated dosing with the currently available immediate-release (IR) carvedilol (given twice daily) and a newly developed controlled-release (CR) formulation (given once daily) in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). We enrolled 188 patients with stable mild, moderate, or severe heart failure as well as survivors of a recent acute myocardial infarction (MI) with asymptomatic LVD (left ventricular ejection fraction </=0.40) in a crossover study. PK variables were initially assessed after patients had received carvedilol IR 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg twice daily for >/=2 weeks. Patients were then switched to the corresponding dose of carvedilol CR (10, 20, 40, or 80 mg once daily), and PK variables were reassessed after an additional 2 weeks. The primary measures included trough plasma concentration (C(tau)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC([0-t])) for both enantiomers of carvedilol of each formulation of the drug. The AUC((0-t)) and the trough and maximum carvedilol concentrations for both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers were similar when carvedilol IR was compared with carvedilol CR as follows: 3.125 mg twice daily versus 10 mg once daily, 6.25 mg twice daily versus 20 mg once daily, 12.5 mg twice daily versus 40 mg once daily, and 25 mg twice daily versus 80 mg once daily, respectively. Based on a pooled analysis, the AUC((0-t)), C(max), and C(tau) for both R(+) and S(-) were equivalent for the CR and IR formulations, with point estimates and 90% confidence intervals within the bioequivalence limits of 80%-125%. The fluctuation index (the CR-IR ratio for [C(max) - C(min)]/C(ss) where C(min) is the minimum observed concentration over the dosing interval and C(ss) is the concentration at steady state) for both R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol was approximately 1, indicating that the peak-to-trough fluctuation in plasma concentration for carvedilol after use of carvedilol CR once daily was similar to that for carvedilol IR given twice daily. The median time to maximum observed plasma concentration (t(max)) was approximately 3 hours longer for both enantiomers after administration of carvedilol CR as compared with carvedilol IR. These data demonstrate that the new carvedilol CR formulation given once daily is equivalent to the currently available carvedilol IR formulation given twice daily in patients with heart failure and asymptomatic post-MI LVD.", 
    "85": "Carvedilol is a beta1-, beta2-, and alpha1-adrenergic blocker that is approved for the treatment of hypertension. A new once-daily, controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol has been shown to be effective in a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. In this article, we summarize the primary results of, and present additional analyses from, that trial. A total of 338 patients with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >/=90 and </=109 mm Hg) were randomized to receive carvedilol CR 20, 40, or 80 mg or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary objective was to compare the effects of the 3 carvedilol CR doses with placebo on 24-hour mean blood pressure using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). Mean DBP and systolic BP (SBP) at the drug trough (20-24 hour) blood levels for carvedilol CR and comparison of DBP and SBP at the drug peak (3-7 hour) blood levels for each dose of carvedilol CR and placebo were investigated. The effects of carvedilol CR on heart rate and pulse pressure were also examined. Once-daily administration of carvedilol CR, alone or in combination with other agents, produced clinically and statistically significant reductions compared with placebo for both DBP and SBP after 6 weeks of treatment for the following parameters: trough blood pressure by office cuff or ABPM measurements, peak blood pressure by ABPM, and 24-hour mean blood pressure by ABPM. Placebo-corrected trough-to-peak ratios for DBP were >0.6 for each carvedilol CR dose. Heart rate and pulse pressure were each significantly reduced compared with placebo for each carvedilol CR dose. We conclude that carvedilol CR is a very effective antihypertensive agent with clear dose-related peak blood pressure reduction and continuous 24-hour control.", 
    "86": "To determine whether the controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol given once daily provides 24-hour beta1-receptor blockade similar to the currently marketed immediate-release (IR) formulation given twice daily, changes in exercise-induced heart rate after bicycle ergometry were measured. The pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relation between S(-)-carvedilol concentration-the enantiomer with beta-blocking activity-and change in exercise-induced heart rate was defined in healthy subjects and was best described using a direct effect inhibitory E(max) model (with E(max) being the maximum effect). The population estimates for E(max) and concentration at 50% of the maximum effect (EC50) were 19.2 beats per minute (an approximately 13% maximum decrease in exercise-induced heart rate) and 7.7 ng/mL, respectively. The PK/PD model was used to predict PD effects in patients with mild-to-severe heart failure and in patients after myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction who had received both the IR and CR formulations of carvedilol. In these patients, carvedilol CR had equivalent predicted overall PD (area under the effect curve) and trough (PD(min)) effects compared with carvedilol IR, indicating 24-hour beta-blocking coverage for the new CR formulation of carvedilol given once daily.", 
    "87": "Carvedilol is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension and mild-to-severe chronic heart failure, as well as the reduction of cardiovascular mortality in clinically stable post-myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Carvedilol is a racemic mixture of R(+) and S(-) enantiomers that combines beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade. For all indications, the immediate-release (IR) formulation of carvedilol is taken twice daily. A controlled-release (CR) formulation of carvedilol that allows once-daily dosing has recently been developed. In this double-blind, parallel-group, crossover study, 122 patients with essential hypertension were randomly allocated to receive low and high doses of carvedilol or placebo. Patients received either a constant low dose (CR 20 mg once daily or IR 6.25 mg twice daily) or were titrated to a high dose (CR 80 mg once daily or IR 25 mg twice daily) before being crossed over to an equivalent dose of the alternative formulation. The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles were compared between patients receiving carvedilol CR and carvedilol IR. The PK profiles for R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol for the 2 formulations were equivalent (based on area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration [C(max)], and trough drug concentration). Consistent with an extended-release formulation, carvedilol CR delayed C(max) by 3.5 hours compared with carvedilol IR. For both carvedilol CR and IR, the attenuation of exercise-induced heart rate in patients with hypertension was maintained over the entire 24-hour period, and the 2 formulations demonstrated equivalent beta(1)-blocking effects at trough (end of the dosing interval [PD(min)]), suggesting that the rate of absorption does not interfere with the PD effect. In this first direct comparison of carvedilol CR and IR in subjects with hypertension, fewer adverse events were reported while subjects were receiving carvedilol CR (59.1% overall) compared with carvedilol IR (77.5% overall). This was true regardless of dose received. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse event for subjects receiving either formulation of carvedilol and placebo. Importantly, dizziness and headache were reported less often when subjects received carvedilol CR. This is the first study to show that both formulations had comparable beta(1)-adrenergic blockade in patients with essential hypertension under steady-state conditions. Notably, carvedilol CR provides consistent beta(1)-adrenergic blockade over 24 hours with a once-daily dose.",

The plasma concentration-time profiles for both R(+)- and S(-)-carvedilol indicate that carvedilol CR will provide coverage over a 24-hour period similar to the current immediate-release (IR) twice-daily formulation. Exposures for both enantiomers, based on area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)), and trough concentrations, are equivalent for carvedilol CR compared with carvedilol IR. C(max) and AUC of the enantiomers of carvedilol increase in an approximate dose-proportional manner after administration of carvedilol CR over the dose range of 10-80 mg, indicating that the formulation provides consistent PK performance across the dose strengths proposed for marketing. The intrasubject and intersubject variability of carvedilol CR was comparable to carvedilol IR. For carvedilol CR, mean AUC and C(max) were increased <20% after a high-fat meal compared with a standard meal. The CR and IR formulations of carvedilol exhibited equivalent steady-state PK characteristics in the target hypertension and heart failure populations. The availability of once-daily dosing is expected to improve treatment adherence and thereby enhance the effectiveness of carvedilol in routine clinical use.",

    "91": "The EuroHeart Failure Survey identified 10,701 patients with suspected or confirmed HF during 2000 and 2001, 64% of whom had an imaging test and 3658 had documented LVSD. This last group constitutes the focus of this report. Renal dysfunction was associated with lower prescription of ACE inhibitors at discharge (74% vs. 83%, p<0.001). Beta-blockers were less often used in patients with respiratory disease (32% vs. 53%, p<0.001). Co-morbidity did not appear to affect the use of spironolactone. There were few important international differences in uptake of key therapies amongst European countries with widely differing cultures and economic status.", 
    "92": "Guidelines appear successful in creating a relatively uniform approach to the treatment for HF due to LVSD in diverse medical cultures. Relevant co-morbidity seems to be responsible for a substantial reduction in the prescription of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers. However, whilst co-morbidity indicates the need for greater caution, it is often not a valid contra-indication to life-saving therapy.", 
    "93": "Potassium channel dysfunction has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, by using potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), we investigated the relationship between the enhancement of potassium currents and the alteration of apoptotic cascade in the neuronal apoptotic model induced by beta-amyloid peptide 1-40(Abeta(1-40)). Cortical neurons exposed to Abeta(1-40) 5 muM developed a specific increase in the delayed rectifier potassium current (I(K)), but not the transient outward potassium currents (I(A)), before the appearance of neuronal apoptosis. Abeta(1-40) induced various apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation, a decrease in the amount of Bcl-2 protein, an increase in the amount of Bax protein, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase-3 activation. Potassium channel blocker 5 mM TEA attenuated Abeta(1-40)-induced neuronal death and prevented the alterations of all above mentioned apoptotic indicators. The study indicates that I(K) enhancement might play an important role in certain form of programmed cell death induced by beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Increased potassium channel activity might trigger the activation of apoptosis cascade in Abeta(1-40)-treated rat cortical neurons.", 
    "94": "The sympathetic nervous system modulates renal function through its receptors namely beta1 (cardiac output and renin release), alpha1 (systemic and renovascular constriction), and beta2 renovascular dilation. Sympathetic overactivity is commonly seen in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is an important contributor to increasing the risk of cardiovascular events as well as increasing renal disease progression. Recent evaluations of drug use in people with CKD shows a remarkably low percentage of patients receiving beta-blockers, especially in more advanced stage CKD when cardiovascular risk is higher. This is in large part due to tolerability of these agents. Moreover, water-soluble beta-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol are dialyzable and require supplementation to avoid exacerbation of arrhythmias following dialysis. Newer vasodilating beta-blockers have better tolerability and different effects on renal hemodynamics as well as metabolic variables. These effects are related to the relative alpha1-blocking effect of agents such as carvedilol and labetolol, with carvedilol having relatively greater alpha-blocking effects. Few studies evaluate beta-blockers on cardiovascular risk in CKD patients. Studies with carvedilol demonstrate attenuated increases in albuminuria as well as reduction in cardiovascular events in CKD patients with hypertension. This paper reviews the animal and clinical trial data that evaluate beta-blockers in CKD highlighting the vasodilating beta-blockers. It is apparent that greater use of this drug class for blood pressure control would further enhance reduction of risk of heart failure, the most common cause of death in the first year of starting dialysis.", 
    "95": "Recent studies suggest that cardiac myocyte apoptosis contributes to the progress of CHF (congestive heart failure). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime for CHF [an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin] may significantly reduce the plasma concentrations of the apoptotic mediators sFas (soluble Fas) and sFasL (soluble Fas ligand) in patients with CHF. An ELISA was used to determine the plasma concentrations of sFas and sFasL in 106 patients with stable CHF at recruitment. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime for CHF (i.e. an ACE inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin). The dose of metoprolol was doubled on a biweekly basis up to 50 mg twice a day or maintained at the maximum tolerated dose. Data after 1 year were available for 92 patients and were analysed. The plasma concentrations of sFas and sFasL in patients with CHF decreased significantly (P<0.01) after 1 year of treatment with metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime compared with at baseline (5.4+/-0.2 compared with 3.2+/-0.1 ng/ml respectively for sFas, and 52.1+/-2.3 compared with 26.7+/-1.0 pg/ml respectively for sFasL). Compared with baseline, after 1 year of treatment with metoprolol in conjunction with the standard treatment regime there were significant improvements in LV (left ventricular) ejection fraction (from 32.6+/-0.9 to 51.5+/-0.8%; P<0.01), LV end-diastolic dimension (from 69.8+/-0.6 to 57.7+/-0.3 mm; P<0.01), LV end-systolic dimension (from 53.9+/-0.6 to 40.5+/-0.5 mm; P<0.01), LV end-diastolic volume (from 254.7+/-5.0 to 164.1+/-2.2 ml; P<0.01) and LV end-systolic volume (from 142.0+/-4.2 to 72.2+/-2.0 ml; P<0.01). In addition, the distance walked in a 6-min walk test increased markedly (P<0.01) from 260.3+/-5.2 m at baseline to 440.9+/-5.7 m after 1 year of treatment. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that metoprolol in conjunction with an ACE inhibitor, diuretics and digoxin in patients with CHF can lead to a reverse in LV remodelling potentially through its anti-apoptotic effects.", 
    "96": "A fixed combination of brimonidine (a highly selective alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist) and timolol (a non-selective beta-blocker) [brimonidine 0.2%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution; brimonidine/timolol] is available for the topical treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OH). Brimonidine and timolol decrease elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) by complementary mechanisms of action and have an additive effect when coadministered to healthy volunteers and patients with glaucoma or OH. When assessed over a 3- or 12-month period in large, well designed clinical studies, brimonidine/timolol instilled twice daily (one drop in each eye) was superior to monotherapy with the individual components instilled two (brimonidine) or three (timolol) times daily, and noninferior to concomitant therapy with the individual components instilled twice daily, in lowering raised IOP in patients with glaucoma or OH. In small, randomised, comparative studies of 1 or 3 months' duration, the IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine/timolol twice daily was similar or superior to that of fixed combination dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution (dorzolamide/timolol) twice daily (preliminary data). Brimonidine/timolol is generally well tolerated with a predictable local and systemic adverse event profile based on that of the individual components used alone and concomitantly. No unexpected or serious adverse events associated with the fixed combination were reported in key clinical trials. Brimonidine/timolol may be advantageous over dorzolamide/timolol with respect to ocular tolerability and comfort (preliminary data).", 
    "97": "Studies on the influence of borneol on the penetration of puerarin eye drops and timolol maleate eye drops through the cornea, and evaluation of the ocular irritability were conducted to provide a theoretical basis for the application of borneol in enhancing corneal permeability. The cornea penetrative experiment in vitro was conducted to observe the quantitative change of puerarin and timolol maleate penetrated through the cornea after administering different dosages of borneol. The corneal hydration level and blinking frequency were recorded as irritability indexes in vitro and in vivo. The steady-flow J of high, middle and low dosage groups of puerarin eye drops with borneol were increased by 49%, 32%, 5% respectively, and permeability parameter Kp increased by 49%, 32%, 5% respectively, as compared to that of the control group. The steady-flow J of high dosage group of timolol maleate eye drops with borneol was increased by 5%; middle and low dosage groups with borneol were decreased by 6%, 3% respectively. The permeability parameter Kp of high dosage group increased by 5%, while middle and low dosage groups with borneol were decreased by 6%, 3% respectively, as compared to that of the control group. Evaluation showed no ocular irritability caused by borneol. The results of this study suggest that the promoting effect of borneol on the permeability of drugs through the cornea in vitro is selective, which indicates that borneol has the potential to be used as an ophthalmic penetration enhancer.", 
    "98": "In this study, new and rapid stability indicating ultraviolet spectroscopic methods were developed and validated for the estimation of ezetimibe and carvedilol in pure form and in their respective formulations. Since both the drugs are poorly water soluble, 20% v/v acetonitrile in triple distilled water was selected as the solvent system for both the drugs. This ensured adequate drug solubility and maximum assay sensitivity. The linearity range for ezetimibe and carvedilol at their respective wavelength of detection of 232 nm and 238 nm was obtained as 2-50 microg/ml and 2-20 microg/ml respectively. The linear regression equations obtained by least square regression method, were Y = 0.0443 x (X) + 0.0106 for ezetimibe and Y = 0.1080 x (X) + 0.034 for carvedilol, where Y is the absorbance and X is the concentration (in microg/ml) of pure drug solution. The detection and quantitation limit as per the error propagation theory were found to be 0.4 microg/ml and 1.3 microg/ml respectively for ezetimibe and 0.7 microg/ml and 2.1 microg/ml respectively for carvedilol. The methods were employed with high degree of precision and accuracy for the estimation of total drug content in two commercial tablet formulations of each of the two drugs. It was concluded that both the developed methods are accurate, sensitive, precise, and reproducible. They can be applied directly for the estimation of drug content in pharmaceutical formulations.", 
    "99": "Angiotensin II (AII) type 1 (AT1) receptor plays a critical role in load-induced cardiac hypertrophy. We have recently found a novel mechanism of mechanical stress-induced activation of the AT1 receptor, which is independent of AII. Mechanical stretch did not activate ERKs in HEK293 cells and COS7 cells which had no AT1 receptor, but when AT1 receptor was overexpressed in these cells, stretch activated ERKs, Galphaq and JAK2. An AT1 receptor blocker, candesartan, inhibited stretch-induced activation of ERKs in these cells. Stretch also activated ERKs in COS7 cells expressing AT1 mutant which did not bind AII and in cardiac myocytes prepared from angiotensinogen null mice. Stretch did not activate ERKs in COS7 cells which overexpressed ETA receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor. Pressure overload induced cardiac hypertrophy in angiotensinogen null mice as well as in wild-type mice, which was significantly inhibited by candesartan. These results suggest that mechanical stress activates AT1 receptor independently of AII, which is inhibited by an inverse agonist candesartan.",

End-stage renal disease was strongly associated with appropriate ICD therapy (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.17-4.54) and remained a significant predictor following adjustment for implant indication, ejection fraction, diabetes, hypertension, and beta-blocker use. Survival was significantly shorter in the end-stage renal disease patients, with a median survival time of 3.2 +/- 0.6 (SEM) years in the dialysis cohort and 7.4 +/- 0.5 (SEM) years in those without end-stage renal disease (log rank P = .009).

    "105": "Cardiovascular complications are important causes of morbidity and mortality following vascular surgery. Adequate preoperative risk assessment and perioperative management may modify postoperative mortality and morbidity and improve long-term prognosis. The objective of this review is to examine the present day knowledge regarding the preoperative evaluation and perioperative management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, focusing specifically on abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Clinical markers combined with ECG and surgical risk assessment can effectively divide patients in a truly low-risk, intermediate and high-risk population. Low-risk patients can probably be operated on without additional cardiac testing. Notably, due to the surgical risk, AAA patients are never low-risk patients. Intermediate-risk and high-risk patients are referred for cardiac testing to exclude extensive stress induced myocardial ischemia, as beta-blockers provide insufficient myocardial protection in this case and preoperative coronary revascularization might be considered. Whether patients at intermediate risk without ischemic heart disease should be treated with statins and/or beta-blockers is still controversial. In high-risk patients, it is strongly advised to administer beta-blockers with heart rate determined dose adjustment, while the effects of preoperative revascularization remain subject to debate.",

    "107": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the transport of tilisolol and timolol through the corneal epithelium, which is believed to be a tight barrier of ocular drug absorption. Cultured normal rabbit corneal epithelial cells (RCEC) were used to investigate drug transport. Primary RCEC were seeded on a filter membrane of Transwell-COL insert coated with fibronectin and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with various supplements. Beta-blocker permeability through the RCEC layer was measured to assess the transcellular permeability coefficient (P(transcell)) in the absence or presence of inhibitors. The transcellular permeability of tilisolol was dependent on drug concentration although timolol showed no concentration dependency. Tilisolol flux from the apical to the basal side was larger than in the opposite direction although timolol showed no direction dependency. The transcellular permeability of tilisolol from the apical to the basal side was inhibited by sodium azide, tetraethylammonium, quinidine, taurocholic acid, guanidine and carnitine. Tilisolol had an active mechanism in uptake to the corneal epithelium, probably by the organic cation transporter family, although timolol predominantly permeated via passive diffusion. This RCEC system was useful to characterize the ocular permeation mechanism of drugs.",

    "112": "Ninety-four trials of prevention of post-operative AF were identified, by standard search methods, and analysed by standard meta-analysis techniques. All five commonly tested interventions, beta-blockers (BBs), sotalol, amiodarone, magnesium, and atrial pacing, were effective in preventing AF. The odds ratio (OR) for the effect of BB on the incidence of AF was 0.36 (95% CI 0.28-0.47, P<0.001), but after trials confounded by post-operative non-study BB withdrawal were excluded was 0.69 (95% CI 0.54-0.87, P=0.002). Sotalol reduced AF, compared with placebo (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.26-0.45, P<0.001) and compared with conventional BB (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.65, P<0.001). Amiodarone reduced AF (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.40-0.57, P<0.001). Magnesium (Mg) also had an effect (OR 0.57 95% CI 0.42-0.77) but there was significant heterogeneity (P<0.001), partly explained by concomitant BB. The effect of Mg with BB was less (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60-1.16). Pacing reduced AF (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.47-0.77, P<0.001), despite wide variations in techniques. Only amiodarone and pacing significantly reduced length of stay, average -0.60 days (95% CI -0.92 to -0.29) and -1.3 days (95% CI -2.55 to -0.08), respectively. Collectively, all treatments analysed together reduced stroke (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41-0.98).

    "114": "The present study demonstrates that acute activation with either beta-adrenergic receptor agonists or H(2)O(2) treatment increases protein phosphatase 2a (PP2a) activity in ventricular myocytes. PP2a activation occurs concomitant with an increase in methylation of PP2a, changes in localization of a PP2a targeting subunit PP2aB56alpha, and a decrease in phosphorylation of PP2a substrates, such as troponin I (TnI) and ERK in ventricular myocytes. Okadaic acid, a well-established pharmacological inhibitor of PP2a, and the peptide Thr-Pro-Asp-Tyr-Phe-Leu (TPDYFL) were used to block PP2a methylation, localization, and phosphorylations. TPDYFL is a highly conserved sequence of the PP2a catalytic subunit COOH-terminus. Specifically, both okadaic acid and the peptide increased beta-adrenergic-cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of TnI and blocked the beta-adrenergic-cAMP-dependent translocation of PP2aB56alpha. TPDYFL, but not a scrambled version of this sequence, blocked H(2)O(2)-induced changes in PP2a methylation and TnI dephosphorylation. Okadaic acid produces similar inhibition of H(2)O(2) effects. Thus we propose that the novel peptide TPDYFL acts as an inhibitor of PP2a activity and may be a useful tool to increase our understanding of how PP2a is regulated and the role of PP2a in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. In addition, the present study is consistent with acute beta-adrenergic receptor activation and H(2)O(2) exposure, simultaneously activating kinases and PP2a to work on common substrates, such as TnI. We hypothesize that dual activation of opposing enzymes provides for a tighter regulation of substrate phosphorylations in ventricular myocytes.",

The statistical analysis has shown that both the diameter of the chambers and the time of spheronization affected the properties of the pellets, and, thus, they must be considered when the spheronizer is used. To minimize these effects all the forming pellets should be processed in all chambers for a defined period of time.",

    "124": "Sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Inc, New York, NY) relaxes vascular smooth muscle, resulting in modest reductions in blood pressure that are insufficient to stimulate a reflex increase in heart rate. These blood pressure reductions are similar for healthy men and men with coronary artery disease (CAD) or who use antihypertensive drugs. Sildenafil does not affect the force of cardiac contraction, and cardiac performance is unaffected. Sildenafil is mildly vasodilating in the coronary circulation and does not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmia. During exercise and recovery, sildenafil does not cause clinically significant alterations in hemodynamic parameters in men with CAD, and it has no negative effects on coronary oxygen consumption, ischemia, or exercise capacity. Clinical trial data from >13,000 patients, 7 years of international postmarketing data, and observational studies of >28,000 men in the United Kingdom and 3813 men in the European Union reveal that (1) there are no special cardiovascular concerns when sildenafil is used in accordance with product labeling and (2) the risk for serious events such as myocardial infarction or death is not increased. However, because safety has not been established in patients with recent serious cardiovascular events, hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, or retinitis pigmentosa, physicians should consult their current local prescribing information before prescribing sildenafil for these patients. Among men with erectile dysfunction treated with sildenafil, the adverse event profile is similar overall to that in men with comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is similar between those with and without CAD, and it is similar between those who take and those who do not take antihypertensive drugs (regardless of the number or class). In a controlled interaction study of sildenafil and amlodipine, the mean additional reduction in supine blood pressure was 8 mm Hg systolic and 7 mm Hg diastolic. Sildenafil should be used with caution in patients who take alpha-blockers because coadministration may lead to symptomatic hypotension in some individuals. When sildenafil is coadministered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy before initiating sildenafil treatment and sildenafil should be initiated at the lowest dose. Also, in the absence of information specific to mixed alpha/beta blockers, such as carvedilol and labetalol, similar care should be taken as for alpha-blockers. Sildenafil potentiates the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration to patients who are using organic nitrates in any form, either regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated. Before prescribing sildenafil, physicians should carefully consider whether their patients with underlying CVD could be affected adversely by resuming sexual activity.

Beta-blocker therapy did not influence the prevalence of fetal distress. Among the infants born to carriers, all those with fetal distress were carriers of the A341V mutation (10 of 10, 100%). Among the offspring of the carriers, 48 of 92 (52%) were mutation carriers, and of those, 15% died suddenly at age 14 +/- 6 years.", 
    "129": "Women affected by the common KCNQ1-A341V mutation are at low risk for cardiac events during pregnancy and without excess risk of miscarriage; their infants delivered by C-section because of fetal distress are extremely likely to also be mutation carriers. Beta-blockers remain recommended. These conclusions likely apply to most LQT1 patients.", 
    "130": "A robustness test of a capillary electrophoresis method for the chiral separation of timolol in nonaqueous acidified media was performed. A two-level Plackett-Burman design was applied in which one qualitative and six quantitative factors were examined. Resolution, migration times and relative migration times to pyridoxine (selected as internal standard) were examined as qualitative responses to evaluate electrophoretic performance. A quantitative response, the content of R-timolol in S-timolol maleate sample, was also considered. Even though some significant factor effects were observed on the qualitative responses, it was still possible to quantify the R-timolol in the S-timolol maleate samples properly. The quantitative response was not significantly affected by the selected factors, demonstrating the robustness of the procedure. However, the use of different HDMS-beta-CD batches seemed to affect both types of responses necessitating to introduce a warning in the procedure. Since the experiments of the Plackett-Burman design can be assimilated to laboratories in an interlaboratory study, uncertainty can be evaluated using the robustness test data. The robustness test was set-up in such a way that the required variances could be estimated.", 
    "131": "We have recently shown that alcohol feeding suppresses natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity partly by decreasing the function of hypothalamic beta-endorphin (beta-EP) neurons. The neuronal mechanism by which hypothalamic beta-EP communicates with the spleen to regulate the action of ethanol on NK cells is not known. In the present study, we evaluated the roles of beta-EP neurons, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in regulation of the ethanol effect on splenic NK cell cytolytic function.", 
    "132": "Male rats were fed an ethanol-containing liquid diet or control diets. These rats were used to determine the hormone release from the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) of the hypothalamus or used to determine the splenic NK cell cytolytic function after PVN administration of CRH or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine. The release of hormones from the PVN was measured using the push-pull perfusion method. Splenic cytolytic activity was determined using the 4-hour (51)Cr release assay against YAC-1 lymphoma target cells.", 
    "133": "Alcohol feeding decreased the amount of beta-EP but increased the amount of CRH in the push-pull perfusate (PPP) samples collected from the PVN. When exogenous beta-EP was perfused into the PVN, it suppressed the release of endogenous CRH found in PPP samples of the PVN. Conversely, perfusion of an opiate antagonist naltrexone into the PVN increased the levels of endogenous CRH in PPP samples of the PVN. In addition, administration of exogenous beta-EP in the PVN stimulated the cytolytic function of NK cells, an action that was antagonized by CRH as well as by ethanol. Corticotropin-releasing hormone and ethanol alone also had an inhibitory action on NK cells. Finally, the ganglionic blocker used prevented the effect that ethanol, beta-EP, and CRH had on NK cells. These data suggest that ethanol inhibits the function of NK cells partly by suppressing the influence of the beta-EP-CRH-ANS signal to the spleen.", 
    "134": "To describe the epidemiology, impact, pathogenesis, patient presentation, and treatment of stable angina, including the use of vasculoprotective and antianginal drug therapies and coronary revascularization procedures.", 
    "135": "Stable angina is an age-related condition that typically affects men at an earlier age than women, adversely affects quality of life, and increases mortality. Stable angina is the result of an increase in myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of coronary arteries chronically narrowed by large, stable atherosclerotic plaques and a diminished myocardial oxygen supply. The characteristics of the chest pain or discomfort contribute to the clinical presentation. Treatment guidelines call for efforts to modify CHD risk, antianginal drug therapy, and patient education. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel may be used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and death. A beta-blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be used as initial antianginal drug therapy, and a long-acting nitrate or dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may be added. The choice among antianginal drug therapies often hinges on patient characteristics, contraindications, and adverse effects. Revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery is an option for ischemia refractory to maximum tolerated dosages of antianginal therapy.", 
    "136": "Various drug therapies may be used to manage stable angina, with coronary revascularization as an option in patients who are refractory to drug therapy. However, antianginal drug therapies may prove inadequate for managing anginal episodes for a variety of reasons, and revascularization is not always effective.", 
    "137": ": Incorporating amiodarone into an existing postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) prevention pathway may reduce postoperative AF and length of stay (LOS).", 
    "138": ": From July 2002 through December 2002, 476 consecutive cardiac surgical patients were managed with an AF prevention protocol using aggressive potassium replacement, intraoperative/postoperative magnesium supplementation, and postoperative resumption of \u03b2-blockers. From January 2003 through June 2003, 592 additional patients were subjected to the same protocol except amiodarone was initiated intraoperatively (150 mg intravenously) and continued postoperatively until discharge (200 mg orally three times daily). Incidence of AF, postoperative LOS, and AF risk factors were collected prospectively and compared using regression models with propensity scores to adjust for dissimilarities between groups.", 
    "139": ": Incorporating amiodarone into an existing AF protocol resulted in a 45% reduction in postoperative AF (29% [136/476] versus 16% [94/592], P < 0.0001). After adjustment for covariates and propensity score, the relative risk reduction with amiodarone in this protocol remained significant (P = 0.001, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.5-0.8). Multivariate risks for postoperative AF included no amiodarone (P = 0.0001), age (P < 0.0001), ejection fraction <40% (P = 0.0005), ventilator support >24 hours (P = 0.002), no postoperative \u03b2-blocker (P = 0.002), and mitral valve procedure (P = 0.03). When postoperative AF did occur, risk adjusted LOS was less in patients on the amiodarone protocol (mean 9.4 days versus 13.1 days, P = 0.06). Readmission after discharge for any reason (10% [49/476] versus 8% [45/592], P = 0.1) or for AF (1.1% [5/476] versus 0.7% [4/592], P = 0.5) was similar between groups.", 
    "140": ": Amiodarone initiated intraoperatively followed by oral dosing significantly reduces postoperative AF and tends to reduce LOS if AF occurs.", 
    "141": "This study compares quantitative and qualitative information on global and regional left ventricular (LV) function obtained with multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) with that obtained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with a high prevalence of LV wall motion abnormalities. Thirty patients (19 male, 63.7+/-15.1 years) with myocardial infarction (n=12), coronary artery disease (n=9), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (n=6), and dilation cardiomyopathy (n=3) were included. Segmental LV wall motion (LV-WM) was assessed using a 4-point scale. Wall thickness measurements were calculated in diastolic and systolic short axis images. Two hundred and fifty-two out of 266 (94.7%) normal and 189 out of 214 (88.3%) segments with decreased wall motion were correctly identified by MDCT, yielding a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 95% for identification of wall motion abnormalities. LV-WM scores were identical in 86.7% of 480 segments (kappa=0.809). MDCT had a tendency to underestimate the degree of wall motion impairment. Interobserver agreement was lower in MDCT (66.5%) than in MRI (89.1%; p<0.01). Normokinetic segments are reliably identified with MDCT. Sensitivity for detection and accurate classification of LV wall motion abnormalities need to be improved. Better temporal resolution of the CT system seems to be the most important factor for enhancing MDCT performance.", 
    "142": "Portal hypertension (PHT) is the most common complication of chronic liver disease and develops in the vast majority of patients with cirrhosis. It is characterized by an increase of the portal vein pressure, and leads to the development of gastroesophageal varices, ascites, renal dysfunction and hepatic encephalopathy. Over the years, it has become clear that a decrease in portal pressure is not only protective against the risk of variceal (re)bleeding but is also associated with a lower long-term risk of developing other complications and with an improved long-term survival. At present, non-selective b-blockers remain the medical treatment of choice for both primary and secondary prophylaxis. However, recent advances in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of cirrhotic PHT have directed future therapy towards the increased intrahepatic vascular resistance, which in part is determined by an increased hepatic vascular tone. This increased vasculogenic component provides the motivation to the use of therapies aimed at increasing intrahepatic vasorelaxing capacity on the one hand and at antagonizing excessive intrahepatic vasoconstrictor force on the other hand. This review covers current and future developments in the treatment of PHT with regard to primary and secondary prophylaxis.", 
    "143": "The clinical usefulness of assessing hemodynamic response to drug therapy in the prophylaxis of variceal rebleeding is unknown. An open-labeled, uncontrolled pilot trial was performed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using the hemodynamic response to pharmacological treatment to guide therapy in this setting. Fifty patients with acute variceal bleeding underwent a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement 5 days after the episode. Nadolol and nitrates were initiated, and a second HVPG was measured 15 days later. Responder patients (> or =20% decrease in HVPG from baseline) were maintained on drugs, partial responders (> or =10% and <20%) had banding ligation added to the drugs, and nonresponders (<10%) received a transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS). Mean follow-up was 22 months. Eight patients (16%) did not receive the second HVPG, 6 of them because of early variceal rebleeding. Of the other 42 patients, 24 were classified as responders (57%); 10 as partial responders (24%), who had banding added; and 8 as nonresponders (19%), who received a TIPS. Patients with cirrhosis of viral etiology compared to alcoholic cirrhosis tended to present more early rebleedings, less response to drugs and needed more TIPS. Variceal rebleeding occurred in 22% of all patients but only in 12% of patients whose hemodynamic response was assessed. The 3 therapeutic groups were not different. In conclusion, using hemodynamic response to pharmacological treatment to guide therapy in secondary prophylaxis to prevent variceal bleeding is feasible and effectively protects patients from rebleeding. In this context, viral cirrhosis seems to present a worse outcome than alcoholic cirrhosis."
