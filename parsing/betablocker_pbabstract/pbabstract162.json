Fifty patients, meeting ICD-10 criteria for major depressive disorder or bipolar depression, were enrolled in our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. One group received paroxetine plus pindolol (2.5 mg t.i.d.), and the other group received paroxetine plus placebo. The proportion of patients with sustained response (>or=50% reduction of baseline HAM-D 17 score maintained until the endpoint; p=0.252) and the proportion of patients with remission (HAM-D 17 <or=8 at last visit; p=0.769) did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups. However, a significantly greater proportion of patients who were not previously treated with antidepressants (n=15; p=0.041) and of patients with bipolar depression (n=11; p=0.015) had a sustained response in the paroxetine plus pindolol group compared to the paroxetine plus placebo group; furthermore there was a trend for first episode depressed patients to have a greater response in the paroxetine plus pindolol group (n=12; p=0.071). Summarizing, the entire study population showed no antidepressive benefit from pindolol augmentation. Nevertheless patients with bipolar depression irrespective of previous treatments and duration of illness, and unipolar patients not previously treated demonstrated a significant benefit from pindolol augmentation.", 
    "1": "To increase our understanding of the endocrine changes associated with parturition in dogs, plasma concentrations of progesterone (P4), 15-ketodihydroprostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGFM), estradiol-17-beta (E2beta), cortisol, ACTH, prolactin (PRL), LH, and FSH were measured in six spontaneously whelping bitches and in six bitches in which parturition was induced with the progesterone-receptor blocker agl\u00e9pristone on day 58 of pregnancy. Expulsion of pups in the induced group took place in the presence of P4 concentrations that were still elevated. PGFM concentrations increased before parturition in both groups, but levels were lower in the induced bitches. PGFM levels reached a maximum in both groups during parturition and quickly decreased in the spontaneously whelping group after parturition, but remained elevated in the induced group. In both groups, cortisol concentrations reached similar maximum levels during the last 30 h before the onset of expulsion. During the 3 days postpartum, cortisol concentrations were higher in the induced group. The highly variable ACTH concentrations did not differ significantly throughout the study within or between groups. In both groups, E2beta concentrations decreased and PRL concentrations increased between the late gestational period and the 30-h period before parturition. Concentrations of both LH (spontaneously whelping group) and FSH (both groups) decreased between late gestation and the postpartum period. The results of this study illustrate the hormonal changes around parturition in the bitch, and reveal that agl\u00e9pristone-induced parturition is associated with still incomplete luteolysis, an altered PGFM profile, and elevated postpartum cortisol concentrations as compared with spontaneously whelping dogs.",

It is known that carvedilol increases left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly, and carvedilol reduces mortality by associating with improvement in LV function. However, the effect of carvedilol on RV function in heart failure has not adequately been studied, so far. The objective is to establish whether the addition of carvedilol has an additive beneficial effect on RVEF and cytokines levels in patients with heart failure who are already receiving treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digoxin and diuretics.",

In this study, the impact of acute and chronic atropine administration on VIP levels in rat heart atria was investigated in relation to heart rate in the course of vagus nerves stimulation. Anaesthetised control and atropinised (10 mg/kg/day for 10 days) rats pretreated with metipranolol and phentolamine that were either given or not a single dose of atropine were subjected to bilateral vagus nerve stimulation (30 min: 0.7 mA, 20 Hz, 0.2 ms). VIP concentrations in the atria were determined after each stimulation protocol. In control rats with or without single atropine administration, the heart rate upon vagal stimulation was higher than in atropinised animals with or without single atropine dose, respectively. VIP concentrations in the control atria were significantly decreased after the stimulation; the decrease was comparable both in the absence and presence of a single dose of atropine. Compared to controls, VIP levels were significantly decreased after chronic atropine treatment and they were not further reduced by vagal stimulation and single atropine administration. Administration of VIP antagonist completely abolished the differences in the heart rate upon vagal stimulation between control and atropinised groups. In conclusion, the data indicate that chronic atropine administration affects VIP synthesis in rat heart atria and consequently it modifies the heart rate regulation.", 
    "13": "A variety of chronic kidney diseases tend to progress towards end-stage kidney disease. Progression is largely due to factors unrelated to the initial disease, including systemic hypertension and proteinuria. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system, either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, reduce both BP and proteinuria and appear superior to a more conventional antihypertensive treatment regimen in preventing progression to end-stage kidney disease. The most recent recommendations state that the BP goal in children with chronic kidney disease is the corresponding 90th centile for body height, age, and gender. Since satisfactory BP control is often not achieved, the mnemonic acronym DELTAREPROSI was generated to recall the following tips for the practical management of hypertension and proteinuria in childhood chronic renal parenchymal disease: DEfinition of hypertension and Low blood pressure TArget in REnal disease (90th centile calculated by means of simple formulas), potential of drugs inhibiting the REnin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system in hypertension and PROteinuria, advantages of SImplified treatment regimens and escalating the doses every SIx weeks.", 
    "14": "The description and understanding of absorption and distribution of potential new drug compounds in the organism is of paramount importance for the successful development of new drugs. However, the currently used physical chemical parameters such as oil-water distribution coefficients and ionization constants frequently fall short when it comes to a detailed description of the highly heterogeneous environments of both lipophilic and hydrophilic characters through which the drug compound passes. In this work, a new procedure based on electrochemistry at the interface between immiscible electrolyte solutions for addressing drug compound-ligand interactions in lipophilic environments as well as nonspecific ligand effects on distribution behavior has been developed. An attractive feature of the method is that it can simultaneously provide data for oil-water partition coefficients and ionization constants. The new procedure is demonstrated using five drug compounds with different physical chemical parameters and cholesterol as the oil-phase ligand. The use of ligand shift ion partition diagrams in the data presentation allows a quick visualization and comparison of a series of related drug compounds.",

Drug concentration was measured by HPLC and the apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)), absorption rate constant (k(a)) and the effective permeability coefficient (P(eff)) were calculated. P(app) of basolateral to apical side and apical to basolateral side was (2.10 +/- 0.13) x 10(-6) and (0.333 +/- 0.018) x 10(-6) cm x s(-1), respectively. Transports of celiprolol across Caco-2 cell monolayer were influenced by both verapamil and Pluronic. The absorption constants (k(a)) of celiprolol at duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon were (0.09 +/- 0.03), (0.14 +/- 0.04), (0.11 +/- 0.03) and (0.05 +/- 0.02) h(-1), k(a) of celiprolol in verapamil group were (0.14 +/- 0.03), (0.24 +/- 0.02), (0.25 +/- 0.03) and (0.23 +/- 0.02) h(-1), and k(a) of celiprolol in Pluronic group were (0.13 +/- 0.02), (0.22 +/- 0.02), (0.22 +/- 0.03) and (0.20 +/- 0.03) h(-1), respectively.

    "17": "The 'funny' (pacemaker, I(f)) current, first described almost 30 years ago in sinoatrial node (SAN) myocytes, is a mixed sodium/potassium inward current, activated on hyperpolarisation in the diastolic range of voltages. 'Funny' (f) channels are activated by intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations according to a mechanism mediating regulation of heart rate by the autonomic nervous system, as well as by voltage hyperpolarisation. Structural subunits of native f-channels are the hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels; of the four HCN isoforms known, HCN4 is the most highly expressed in SAN tissue. The I(f) current is a natural target in the search for drugs aimed specifically at affecting heart rate, given its function in pacemaking. Increased heart rate has a negative influence on clinical outcome in patients with cardiovascular disease, and indeed is also an established risk factor for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population. Clearly, therefore, independent reduction of heart rate, through inhibition of the I(f) current, appears to be a suitable therapeutic option for patients with ischaemic heart disease.beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) reduce intracellular cAMP levels, and a substantial part of their negative chronotropic effect is therefore attributable to a reduction of the I(f) current. However, neither beta-blockers nor Ca(2+) channel antagonists, both of which have traditionally been used to reduce myocardial ischaemia, are 'pure' heart rate-lowering drugs. These agents may, in fact, have adverse cardiovascular and noncardiovascular effects.Conversely, the novel heart rate-reducing agent ivabradine is a specific blocker of f-channels, hence a selective inhibitor of the pacemaker I(f) current in the SAN. Ivabradine slows heart rate by reducing the I(f) current-regulated steepness of the diastolic depolarisation in SAN myocytes, thereby increasing diastolic duration, without altering action potential duration or causing negative inotropy. As such, ivabradine is particularly useful in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. Further clinical studies are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of ivabradine in patients with coronary heart disease, left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. This short article reviews the current state of knowledge of the properties of the 'funny' current in relation to exploitation of the I(f) function in pacemaking generation and modulation for the pharmacological control of heart rate.", 
    "18": "Variceal rebleeding is a very frequent and severe complication in cirrhotic patients; therefore, its prevention should be mandatory. Lately several studies demonstrated that the rate of rebleeding was decreased by 40% and overall survival is improved by 20% with beta-blockers. However, this treatment presents some problems, such as the number of nonresponders and contraindications for its use. Recent trials found that the combination of beta-blockers with mononitrate of isosorbide to be superior to beta-blockade alone. Furthermore, endoscopic band ligation also shown to decrease the frequency of rebleeding, complications, and death compared with sclerotherapy and should be the preferred endoscopic treatment. In addition, the comparison between combined pharmacologic treatment with endoscopic treatment present similar rebleeding and mortality rates. More recently, the addition of nadolol to endoscopic band ligation increased the efficacy of endoscopy alone in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. These studies suggest that banding plus drugs could be the treatment of choice for the prophylaxis of rebleeding. When these treatments fail, the recommendation is to use transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or surgical shunts. Both treatments are effective in preventing rebleeding; however, they are associated with a greater risk of encephalopathy. The comparison of portacaval shunts with TIPS demonstrated that TIPS patients presented higher rebleeding, treatment failure, and transplantation. Another randomized controlled trial comparing distal splenorenal shunt with TIPS shows that variceal rebleeding was similar in both groups without differences in encephalopathy and mortality. The only difference observed was the higher rate of reintervention observed in the TIPS group to maintain his patency.", 
    "19": "Variceal bleeding is still a life-threatening complication of portal hypertension responsible for an appreciable rate of morbidity and mortality. The most appropriate treatment approach, whether drugs (nonselective beta-blockers) or endoscopic (variceal band ligation) therapy, to prevent the initial bleed, or primary prophylaxis, is an issue of controversy. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that banding seems to be somehow slightly more effective than beta-blockers at preventing a first bleeding episode, but this does not translate to improved survival. The firmness of this conclusion is, in addition, diminished by the small sample size and short follow-up of most studies. Moreover, adverse events due to banding are more severe than those associated with beta-blockers. Thus, beta-blockers remain as first-line therapy in patients with cirrhosis and large esophageal varices. Prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers can be considered in patients with small varices, especially in those with red signs or Child class C liver disease. The available evidence does not support the idea that organic nitrates improve the efficacy of beta-blockers in primary prophylaxis. The method used to establish the dose of beta-blockers and check its effect on hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) has also been disputed. An attractive strategy is to measure the HVPG response to beta-blockers as a guide to primary prophylaxis, with the aim of switching to another therapy, that is, band ligation, in HVPG nonresponders. However, no study has yet demonstrated that banding as rescue therapy in nonresponders lowers the risk of first bleeding and improves survival.", 
    "20": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for approximately one-third of all deaths in patients with heart failure, and is generally the result of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or ventricular fibrillation (VF). The mechanisms of VT/VF associated with heart failure are complex and heterogeneous; they include functional and structural remodeling, as well as neurohormonal activation. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is very useful for preventing SCD, but the improvement of outcome is limited in patients with cardiac dysfunction and advanced heart failure. This article reviews the current status of drug therapy for the treatment of VT/VF in patients with heart failure. Chronic beta-blocker therapy reduces SCD and improves survival. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists are thought to reduce SCD by preventing ventricular remodeling. Amiodarone is potentially effective for preventing VT/VF in patients at high risk, especially those with nonischemic heart failure. This may be a result of the complex pharmacodynamics of amiodarone, which affects many kinds of ion channels/transporters, as well as thyroid function. The pure class III antiarrhythmic drug, nifekalant, is useful in the emergency treatment of VT/VF.", 
    "21": "Adenosine is known as an endogenous cardioprotectant. We previously reported that plasma adenosine levels increase in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), and that a treatment that further elevates plasma adenosine levels may improve the pathophysiology of CHF. Therefore, we performed a prospective, open-randomized clinical trial to determine whether or not exposure to dipyridamole for 1 year improves CHF pathophysiology compared with conventional treatments. The study enrolled 28 patients (mean+/-SEM: 66+/-4 years of age) attending specialized CHF outpatient clinics with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III, no major complications, and stable CHF status during the most recent 6 months under fixed medications. They were randomized into three groups with or without dipyridamole (Control: n=9; 75 mg/day: n=9; 300 mg/day: n=10) in addition to their original medications and were followed up for 1 year. The other drugs were not altered. Among the enrolled patients, 100%, 4%, 100%, and 79% received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone analogue, loop diuretics, and beta-adrenoceptor blocker, respectively. Fifteen patients suffered from dilated cardiomyopathy, and 7/3/3 patients suffered from ischemic/valvular/hypertensive heart diseases, respectively. Mean blood pressure was comparable among the groups. While the baseline conditions were comparable, we found that echocardiographic ejection fraction (p<0.01 vs. baseline, p<0.01 vs. Control), left ventricular systolic diameter (p<0.05, p<0.05), Specific Activity Scale (SAS) score (p<0.05, p<0.01), maximal oxygen consumption (p<0.05, p<0.05) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide level (p<0.01, p<0.01) were significantly improved in patients with dipyridamole after 1 year, generally in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we suggest that an additional administration of dipyridamole further improves CHF pathophysiology.", 
    "22": "We previously reported that hypoxia-mediated reductions in alpha-adrenoceptor sensitivity do not explain the augmented vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise, suggesting an enhanced vasodilator signal. We hypothesized that beta-adrenoceptor activation contributes to augmented hypoxic exercise vasodilatation. Fourteen subjects (age: 29 +/- 2 years) breathed hypoxic gas to titrate arterial O(2) saturation (pulse oximetry) to 80%, while remaining normocapnic via a rebreath system. Brachial artery and antecubital vein catheters were placed in the exercising arm. Under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, baseline and incremental forearm exercise (10% and 20% of maximum) was performed during control (saline), alpha-adrenoceptor inhibition (phentolamine), and combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor inhibition (phentolomine/propranolol). Forearm blood flow (FBF), heart rate, blood pressure, minute ventilation, and end-tidal CO(2) were determined. Hypoxia increased heart rate (P < 0.05) and minute ventilation (P < 0.05) at rest and exercise under all drug infusions, whereas mean arterial pressure was unchanged. Arterial adrenaline (P < 0.05) and venous noradrenaline (P < 0.05) were higher with hypoxia during all drug infusions. The change (Delta) in FBF during 10% hypoxic exercise was greater with phentolamine (Delta306 +/- 43 ml min(-1)) vs. saline (Delta169 +/- 30 ml min(-1)) or combined phentolamine/propranolol (Delta213 +/- 25 ml min(-1); P < 0.05 for both). During 20% hypoxic exercise, DeltaFBF was greater with phentalomine (Delta466 +/- 57 ml min(-1); P < 0.05) vs. saline (Delta346 +/- 40 ml min(-1)) but was similar to combined phentolamine/propranolol (Delta450 +/- 43 ml min(-1)). Thus, in the absence of overlying vasoconstriction, the contribution of beta-adrenergic mechanisms to the augmented hypoxic vasodilatation is dependent on exercise intensity.", 
    "23": "With the goal of assessing the environmental risk of pharmaceuticals, we have previously observed that a mixture of 13 different drugs at environmentally relevant concentrations had adverse consequences on human and zebra fish cells in vitro. Here we aimed to identify both main and interaction effects within the same environmentally relevant mixture of pharmaceuticals. We studied in vitro cytotoxicity in Escherichia coli, human embryonic HEK293, and estrogen-responsive OVCAR3 tumor cells using fractional-factorial experimental design. Our approach identified a subset of compounds of primary environmental concern, namely atenolol, bezafibrate, ciprofloxacin, and lincomycin, that had statistically significant effects on prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells at environmentally relevant exposure levels (ng/l). Drugs could interact and behave as chemosensitizers, with joint effects representing a statistically significant element of mixture toxicity. Effects and interactions were concentration dependent, confirming the difficulty of dose extrapolation in mixture toxicity data. This study suggests that a thorough investigation of mixture effects can direct environmental concerns toward a handful of pharmaceuticals, which may represent an actual risk at environmental concentrations. We indicate that risk identification may strongly depend on the use of environmentally relevant exposure scenarios. Antagonistic-synergistic interactions and dose dependency of effects may hamper the modeling and prediction of mixture toxicity with pharmaceuticals. Hazard identification for micropollutants depends heavily on appropriate study designs, and we indicate the use of in vitro cytotoxicity threshold and statistical design of experiments (DOEs) as a valid approach.", 
    "24": "Oxidative stress is associated with exacerbation of renal injuries in hypertension. In clinical studies benidipine hydrochloride (benidipine), a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with antioxidant activity, reduced oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of suppression of oxidative stress remains to be fully characterized. Reactive oxygen species production by polymorphonuclear leukocyte plays important pathological roles in hypertension. Therefore, we examined the effects of benidipine both on reactive oxygen species production of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and oxidative stress of an animal model. Human peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocyte-like differentiated HL-60 cells were used to examine effects of benidipine (0.1-30 microM) on formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-induced reactive oxygen species production, calcium mobilization, NADPH oxidase activation and phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrates. High-salt (8% NaCl) loaded stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with or without benidipine (1, 3, 10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, a plasma oxidative stress marker, and renal expression of oxidative stress-induced genes were measured. Benidipine concentration-dependently suppressed formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-induced reactive oxygen species production in polymorphonuclear leukocytes more potently than other calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, azelnidipine, nitrendipine and nifedipine. Benidipine partially inhibited all of intracellular Ca(2+) elevation, protein kinase C activation and NADPH oxidase activation. Salt loading in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats augmented plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels; renal dysfunction; and renal expression of transforming growth factor-beta, collagen I and collagen III mRNAs; which were attenuated by benidipine treatment. These results indicate that benidipine prevents the polymorphonuclear leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species production, which is due at least in part to its antioxidant action and inhibition of Ca(2+)/protein kinase C/NADPH oxidase signaling. The attenuation of reactive oxygen species production might contribute to the drug's reduction of oxidative stress and renal injuries in hypertension.", 
    "25": "Pulse pressure (PP) is an independent marker of cardiovascular risk, even in treated hypertensive subjects, but is often little changed by antihypertensive treatment.

They were followed for 6 months after allocation to either a control group or an added treatment group (doxazosin, 1 to 4 mg plus beta-blocker when needed). The changes in PP and various blood pressure (BP) measures, including mean BP (MP), SBP, and diastolic BP (DBP) during follow-up, were related to changes in plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UAR).", 
    "27": "Although self-measured MP was significantly lowered in the added treatment group, PP was not changed overall, although some patients showed a decrease, and others showed an increase.

However, no such corresponding relationships were observed when home PP decreased. The change in home PP, but not clinic PP, was positively and linearly associated with the change in UAR.",

The study was multi-centre and double-blind, and included 304 middle-aged to elderly patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were randomized to receive either zofenopril 30-60 mg once daily (od) or atenolol 50-100 mg od for 4 weeks with the possibility to an up-titration in non-responding patients. The higher dose level was then administered until 12 weeks after randomization. Blood pressures (BPs) were substantially reduced by either treatment, but after 4 weeks, the systolic and diastolic BP reductions were significantly greater (p < 0.05) with zofenopril (-15.6/-13.5 mmHg) compared with atenolol (-13.1/-11.8 mmHg). After 12 weeks and the possibility of dose up-titration, BP differences between treatments were no longer significant. However, control rates (sitting diastolic BP < 90 mmHg) for zofenopril remained significantly higher compared with atenolol. The number of subjects with adverse drug reactions possibly or probably related to the study medication was 14 (9.1%) in the zofenopril group and 30 (20.8%) in the atenolol group (p = 0.008). It is concluded that zofenopril as well as atenolol induces substantial reductions of diastolic BP in middle-aged to elderly patients with hypertension. However, the control rate when initiating antihypertensive therapy with zofenopril is higher than that for atenolol.",

GA was assessed as usual (prescribing \"yes\" or \"no\"), through evaluation of target dosing, while adjusting for potential clinical contraindications, and through a modified Guideline Adherence Indicator-3 (mGAI-3), which assesses three relevant groups of substances according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class: ACE-Inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers (BB) and aldosterone-antagonists (AA).",

    "47": "The propensity to self-administer cocaine may be a function of both its positively reinforcing and aversive effects, with the latter acting as a limiting factor on overall drug taking. However, relative to what is known about the physiological underpinnings of cocaine's positively reinforcing effects, little is known about its aversive effects. There is some evidence that cocaine's aversive effects, as indexed in the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) preparation, are catecholaminergically mediated, i.e., through cocaine's actions on the dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. Although limited evidence suggests a role for dopamine, there has yet to be a direct assessment of noradrenergic involvement. To better characterize a role for this system, cocaine-induced CTAs (10, 18 and 32 mg/kg) were conducted under conditions of antagonism at the norepinephrine alpha(1) and beta receptors using prazosin (0.3 mg/kg; Experiment 2) and propranolol (10 mg/kg; Experiment 3), respectively, at doses that were determined to be non-aversive (Experiment 1). In each case of noradrenergic antagonism, CTAs with cocaine were not attenuated, suggesting that this drug's conditioned aversive effects are mediated by non-noradrenergic NT activity. Furthermore, prazosin and propranolol administration appeared to facilitate the conditioned aversive effects of cocaine. The implications of these findings in regards to other neurochemical processes are discussed.", 
    "48": "Tonic immobility (TI) is an unlearned fear response induced by a brief physical restraint and characterized by a marked autonomic nervous system involvement. This experiment aimed at studying the relative involvement of both autonomic sub-systems, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, during TI, by analyzing Heart Rate Variability. Quail selected genetically for long (LTI) or short (STI) TI duration and quail from a control line (CTI) were used. The animals were surgically fitted with a telemetric device to record electrocardiograms before and during a TI test. Heart rate did not differ between lines at rest. The induction of TI, whether effective or not, induced an increase in HR characterized by a shift of the sympathovagal balance towards a higher sympathetic dominance. Parasympathetic activity was lower during effective than during non-effective inductions in CTI quail. During TI, the increase in sympathetic dominance was initially maintained and then declined, while relative parasympathetic activity remained low, especially in CTI and STI lines. The end of tonic immobility was characterized by a rise in overall autonomic activity in all lines and an increase in parasympathetic influence in CTI and STI quail. To conclude, the susceptibility to TI cannot be explained only by autonomic reflex changes. It is probably strongly related to the perception of the test by the quail. During TI, the differences between lines in autonomic responses probably reflect behavioural differences in the fear response.",

Design and fast pharmacological profiling of single enantiomeric molecules combining beta-adrenoceptor affinity with other pharmacophores is also still challenging ability. As the use of chiral stationary phases in HPLC has particularly benefited from results of supramolecular chemistry, this review summarises recent achievements provided by this technique in deciphering of enatiorecognition phenomena affecting pharmacological selectivity of beta-adrenergics and beta-adrenolytics and modifying the efficiency of currently proposed beta-adrenoceptor-targeted therapies.

    "50": "Inhibitors of carboanhydrase (ICA) in the form of dorzolamide 2% drops and brinzolamide 1% drops are in use for 8-10 years, with a significant intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect. The goal of the present study was to obtain precise data on the efficacy of local ICA in conjunction with timolol 0.5% drops, and to evaluate the incidence of side effects. This was a prospective study that lasted 2 years and included 110 patients. Initial IOP values, before therapy with ICA, amounted to 19 +/- 8.4 mm Hg in group A and 20.5 +/- mm Hg in group B. Although the results obtained demonstrated statistically significant lowering of IOP (in group A by 4.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, and in group B by 4.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) after therapy with ICA, the difference between the groups was not found. Dorzolamide more frequently caused local side effects like aching, itching and pain in the eye. Aditional lowering of lOP in our patients was somewhat greater than reported before (4.6:4.3). Side effects (itching, aching, pain) were three times more frequent in the group treated with dorzolamide than reported by other authors; this difference could be due to patient age, as our patients were mostly elderly people and the data are subjective. The results of this study suggested the effectiveness of additional local therapy with ICA in patients with open angle glaucoma.",

We hypothesized that either positive or negative inotropic agents can affect the hemodynamic energy, which can be measured using the energy equivalent pressure (EEP) and surplus hemodynamic energy (SHE). This study examined the change in hemodynamic energy induced by dopamine, epinephrine, and esmolol infusion in terms of the EEP and SHE. Dopamine (5, 10 microg/kg/min), epinephrine (0.02, 0.1 microg/kg/min) and esmolol (after bolus 1 mg/kg, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg/min) were infused into six anesthetized dogs. The hemodynamic parameters were collected in the descending thoracic aorta. The mean arterial pressure, blood flow, EEP, and SHE increased significantly with the dopamine infusion. The mean arterial pressure and EEP decreased significantly after the esmolol infusion, while it increased after the epinephrine infusion (p < 0.05 respectively). There was a correlation between the EEP and flow on the descending aorta during the dopamine, esmolol and epinephrine infusions (p < 0.05 respectively). In conclusion, the change in hemodynamic energy induced by dopamine, esmolol, and epinephrine may be expressed in terms of the EEP and SHE.

    "56": "Agitoxin 2 (AgTx2) is a 38-residue scorpion toxin, cross-linked by three disulfide bridges, which acts on voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels. Maurotoxin (MTX) is a 34-residue scorpion toxin with an uncommon four-disulfide bridge reticulation, acting on both Ca(2+)-activated and Kv channels. A 39-mer chimeric peptide, named AgTx2-MTX, was designed from the sequence of the two toxins and chemically synthesized. It encompasses residues 1-5 of AgTx2, followed by the complete sequence of MTX. As established by enzyme cleavage, the new AgTx2-MTX molecule displays half-cystine pairings of the type C1-C5, C2-C6, C3-C7, and C4-C8, which is different from that of MTX. The 3D structure of AgTx2-MTX solved by (1)H-NMR, revealed both alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures, consistent with a common alpha/beta scaffold of scorpion toxins. Pharmacological assays of AgTx2-MTX revealed that this new molecule is more potent than both original toxins in blocking rat Kv1.2 channel. Docking simulations, performed with the 3D structure of AgTx2-MTX, confirmed this result and demonstrated the participation of the N-terminal domain of AgTx2 in its increased affinity for Kv1.2 through additional molecular contacts. Altogether, the data indicated that replacement of the N-terminal domain of MTX by the one of AgTx2 in the AgTx2-MTX chimera results in a reorganization of the disulfide bridge arrangement and an increase of affinity to the Kv1.2 channel.",

    "72": "Preconditioning of sublethal ischemia exhibits neuroprotection against subsequent ischemia-induced neuronal death. It has been indicated that glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-induced neuronal death or neurodegeneration. To elucidate whether prestimulation of glutamate receptor could counter ischemia-induced neuronal death or neurodegeneration, we examined the effect of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA), an ionotropic subtype of glutamate receptor, on excess glutamate-induced excitotoxicity using primary cortical neuronal cultures. We found that AMPA exerted a neuroprotective effect in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A blocker of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), LY294002 (10 microM), significantly attenuated AMPA-induced protection. In addition, Ser473 of Akt/PKB, a downstream target of PI3K, was phosphorylated by AMPA administration (10 microM). Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), which has been reported to be inactivated by Akt, was phosphorylated at Ser9 by AMPA. Ser9-phosphorylated GSK3beta or inactivated form would be a key molecule for neuroprotection, insofar as lithium chloride (100 microM) and SB216763 (10 microM), inhibitors of GSK3beta, also induced phosphorylation of GSK3beta at Ser9 and exerted neuroprotection, respectively. Glutamate (100 microM) increased cleaved caspase-3, an apoptosis-related cysteine protease, and caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO; 1 microM) blocked glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in our culture. AMPA (10 microM, 24 hr) and SB216763 (10 microM) prominently decreased glutamate-induced caspase-3 cleavage. These findings suggest that AMPA activates PI3K-Akt and subsequently inhibits GSK3beta and that inactivated GSK3beta attenuates glutamate-induced caspase-3 cleavage and neurotoxicity.",

The goal of the present study is to explore the functional contribution of the two subunits to the toxicity of beta-Bgt. beta-Bgt was found to induce apoptotic death of SK-N-SH cells via elevating intracellular Ca(2+) and intracellular ROS production. Moreover, an activation of p38 MAPK was associated with the cytotoxicity of beta-Bgt. SB202190 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), N-acetylcysteine (antioxidant reagent), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (Ca(2+) chelator) and the inhibitors of Ca(2+) release from intracellular depots (ruthenium red and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate) effectively attenuated the cytotoxicity of beta-Bgt. In sharp contrast to the inability of A chain, B chain was able to induce cytotoxic effects on SK-N-SH cells as beta-Bgt did. Abolishment of PLA(2) activity did not significantly alter the cytotoxic activity of beta-Bgt. MK801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist), antibodies against NMDA receptor and 4-aminopyridine (a potassium channel blocker) markedly reduced the cytotoxic effects of beta-Bgt, B chain and catalytically inactivated beta-Bgt. Moreover, antibodies against NMDA receptor blocked the binding of rhodamine-labeled beta-Bgt to SK-N-SH cells. Taken together, our data indicate that B chain is a functional subunit responsible for the cytotoxicity of beta-Bgt, and suggest that the cytotoxicity of beta-Bgt is mediated by NMDA receptor and potassium conductance.",

With key pharmacological experiments, both under in vivo and in vitro conditions, we apply urea in concentrations corresponding to physiological and pathological ones. We established that endogenous urea (without use as an exogenous applied drug) possesses important properties. It is assumed that urea is an endogenous non-specific beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (ENBARA), non-selective, non-competitive, reversible and non-toxic. Based on these data we develop a concept for endogenous beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (EBARA). In agreement with proofs of RJ Lefkowitz' group in the 90-ies that \"beta arrestines 1 and 2 antagonize three of four agonist-activated beta-adrenergic receptors\" we accept that they act as relatively endogenous specific beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (RESBARA). As regards for the last four beta-agonist-activated adrenergic receptor we propose that is controlled via ENBARA. That is why a new role of urea is to be in the list of endocoids (autacoids).",

Testing this model in humans is the subject of the present fMRI study. Healthy subjects watched emotional and neutral stimuli after having received a betablocker or placebo. Cortisol levels of all subjects were determined and served as a marker of the subject's (endogenous) cortisol level during the experiment. Viewing emotional pictures resulted in increased amygdala activation compared to neutral pictures and this effect was enhanced in subjects with a high versus low cortisol level under placebo condition. Betablockade with propranolol, lowering the noradrenergic level in the amygdala, disrupted this effect and apparently the interaction with cortisol. These data support the hypothesis that high endogenous cortisol levels at the time of encoding interact with noradrenergic activation in the amygdala in man.",

The resultant extrudate was characterised using steady state parallel plate rheometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dissolution testing. Higher screw speeds were observed to result in slightly lower matrix melt viscosity when compared with matrices compounded using lower screw speeds. Dissolution testing showed that the incorporation of the hydrophobic PCL polymer into a PEO matrix results in a retarded drug release profile.",

    "117": "The cardiovascular effects of tyramine, and its interactions with propranolol, atenolol, phentolamine, prazosin, yohimbine and atropine, have been investigated in anesthetized rats in vivo and in vitro. Tyramine (i.v.) increased both the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Phentolamine, prazosin or a combination of prazosin and yohimbine caused an inhibition of the hypertensive effect of tyramine, but propranolol, atenolol and/or atropine had no effect. Propranolol added to rats receiving atropine depressed the chronotropic effect of tyramine. However, in non-atropinized animals, the positive chronotropic effect of tyramine was paradoxically enhanced by propranolol, and further enhanced by atropine. A similar result was found with atenolol pre-treated animals. Phentolamine did not alter the effects of propranolol and atropine on heart rate. Prazosin depressed the positive chronotropic effects of tyramine, and this effect was re-stored by pre-treatment of the animals with both prazosin and yohimbine. In the isolated atria, propranolol--in contrast to the in vivo results--inhibited the chronotropic effect of tyramine. Atropine potentiated the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol and tyramine. Tyramine produced a concentration-dependent contraction of isolated thoracic aortic rings, and this was potentiated by N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, or by removal of the endothelium, but inhibited by phentolamine. The in vivo and in vitro effects of tyramine were not seen in rats which had been treated with reserpine. We conclude that the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of tyramine in the rat are due to indirect release of transmitter. The results suggest that the paradoxical enhancement by propranolol and atenolol of the chronotropic effect in vivo could be due to tyramine causing increased vagal activity, such that an inhibitory effect of propranolol can only be revealed in animals treated with atropine.", 
    "118": "Glaucoma is a major cause of vision loss throughout the world. Treatment for glaucoma consists of reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) to an acceptable target range to prevent further optic nerve damage. Typically, this involves the selection of a topical IOP-lowering agent. Five major classes of glaucoma medications are presently available for clinical use. These include alpha-adrenergic agonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs), cholinergics and prostaglandin analogs (PGAs). Although beta-blockers enjoyed great success as first-line glaucoma therapy for many years, recently the PGAs have gained favor as the initial treatment of choice for most patients. Although the PGAs offer robust IOP reduction as monotherapy, a significant number of patients will require an adjunctive agent for adequate IOP control. Recent studies have demonstrated that alpha-agonists, beta-blockers and CAIs can be used safely and effectively as adjunctive therapy for patients being treated with a PGA. Comparison studies are beginning to appear in the literature to help determine which adjunctive agent is the most effective when used in combination with a PGA. Additional IOP-lowering efficacy with adjunctive therapy does have limitations, particularly with the addition of a third or fourth agent. For those patients on maximal tolerated medical therapy who still need additional IOP reduction, other available options include laser trabeculoplasty and filtration surgery.",

The advantages offered by MIPs, in terms of selectivity and specificity, were compared with the most commonly polymeric materials used (the lipophilic-hydrophilic balanced Oasis HLB cartridges). Even though recoveries achieved with both sorbents were similar, ranging from 50 to 110% for sewage treatment plant (STP) effluent and 40-110 for STP influent, respectively, MIPs provided lower method detection limits than Oasis HLB, due to their specificity for target analytes and closely related analogues. Method detection limits (MDL) achieved using MIPs ranged from 0.2 to 6.4 ng/L for STP effluent and from 0.4 to 6.5 ng/L for STP influent. To highlight the advantages of MIPs against conventional polymeric cartridges, a detailed matrix effects study as well as cross reactivity tests were performed. For the latter purpose, the extraction efficiency of some pharmaceuticals and pesticides belonging to different therapeutic classes was assessed. LC-QqLIT MS, used for quantification and confirmation, proved to be a powerful analytical tool, as instrumental detection limits (IDL) achieved ranged from 0.2 to 2.7 pg injected (in multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM)). In addition the inclusion of high sensitive MS/MS scans for each compound when working in Information Dependent Acquisition mode (IDA) provided extra confirmation for unequivocal identification of target compounds in complex environmental matrices.",

Only captopril consistently improved these abnormalities and reduced the cortical expression of several proinflammatory and profibrotic factors including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). These effects were independent of blood pressure, accompanied by increased urine N-acetylseryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) levels, and the restoration of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II to baseline levels. Losartan or simvastatin alone or together had no effect, and their addition to captopril did not enhance protection. In vitro, angiotensin II stimulated TGF-beta in renal tubular cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Captopril or Ac-SDKP suppressed angiotensin II-induced MAPK activation and TGF-beta secretion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition confers renoprotection in adriamycin nephropathy by reducing intrarenal angiotensin II and augmenting Ac-SDKP expression that together attenuate MAPK signaling and its downstream proinflammatory and fibrogenic properties.

LV torsion and torsional rate profiles were analyzed from DTI data sets (apical and basal short-axis images) with high temporal resolution (6.5 +/- 0.7 ms). Repeated-measures regression models showed moderately strong correlation of peak LV twisting with peak LV untwisting rate (r = 0.74), as well as correlations of peak LV untwisting rate with the time constant of LV pressure decay (tau, r = -0.66) and IVPG (r = 0.76, P < 0.0001 for all).

The mean (95% CI) heart rate was 73 (71-74) beats min(-1) in the beta-blockade group, which was significantly lower than the placebo group (mean heart rate 82, P=0.0001). There was no correlation between heart rate and 30 day cardiac complications (P=0.848). The reduction in heart rate was associated with increased drug-associated adverse events (OR 2.53, 95% CI 2.05-3.13, P<0.0001). A major limitation of this analysis may be that postoperative heart rate was not a primary outcome in any of the studies identified and the mean postoperative heart rate achieved may be too high to realize optimal cardioprotection.",

    "149": "In elderly patients, atrial fibrillation prevalence exceeds 10% and is commonly associated with heart failure rendering their management even more challenging. Therapies to be considered for heart failure related atrial fibrillation include appropriate treatment of underlying disease, prevention of thromboembolism, rate or rhythm control. The debate regarding rate versus rhythm control in the management of this group of patients has yet to be resolved. For old patients, the management requires an individual approach, which largely depends on comorbid conditions, underlying cardiac disease, and patient and physician preferences. Use of antiarrhythmic drug therapy for maintenance of sinus rhythm carries concerns of risk and limited efficacy. Catheter ablation for rhythm control is feasible for some patients, but further studies are needed to define the risks and benefits especially in older patients. Atrioventricular nodal ablation associated with pacing therapy is an effective non-pharmacological therapy in selected patients with medically refractory permanent high heart rate atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Several studies are ongoing and will provide more insight into the management of such patients.", 
    "150": "Heart failure patient in the elderly is a growing population with poor prognosis. However this patient population has not been well studied. The present study is based on a hospital cohort heart failure registry during 2005 at Heart Failure Centre Medicine, Dept. of Medicine, SU/Sahlgrenska Hospital. In this study 150 patients were enrolled consecutively for analysis. They are aged around 80 years old with high comorbidity. One-year mortality is 30%. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that significant prognostic indicators for mortality are increasing age, New York Heart Association functional class and presence of comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and renal failure. The use of aldosterone receptor antagonist is also associated with poor prognosis. Prescriptions of ACE inhibitor and beta-blockers are 57.5% and 73% respectively. Added-on therapy with angiotensin receptor 1 antagonist is few. In around 30% of prescriptions of ACE inhibitors daily dose is less than half of target dose. In around 54% of beta-blockers daily dose is less than half of target dose. There are clear potential for improved medications with guideline recommended agents in light of the fact that in these study patients 82% of heart rates is >60 beats/min, 84% of S-creatinine is <150 mmol/l, 17.4% of systolic blood pressure is 140-160 mmHg and 10% is 160-180 mmHg.", 
    "151": "This study provides an insight into the characteristics of a very old heart failure group with high comorbidity and mortality in a real situation. In agreement with previous studies, increasing age was associated with reduced likelihood of treatment particularly in ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor 1 blocker but this has been improved particularly in beta-blocker. There is a need to further improve education and application of guideline recommended medications for patients with heart failure for their well-being and survival.",

    "158": "The RAAS is initiated by the regulated secretion of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of angiotensin (Ang) I from the N-terminus of angiotensinogen. Ang I is in turn hydrolyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to form Ang II, a potent vasoconstrictor and the primary active product of the RAAS. Recent evidence has suggested that other metabolites of Ang I and II may have biological activity, particularly in tissues. Development of agents that block the RAAS (e.g., beta blockers, ACE inhibitors [ACE Is], and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]) began as a therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension. Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated important additional cardiovascular and renal therapeutic benefits of ACE Is and ARBs. However, blockade of the RAAS with these agents is incomplete.", 
    "159": "Therapeutic approaches that target more complete inhibition of the RAAS may offer additional clinical benefits for patients with cardiovascular and renal disorders. These approaches may include dual blockade using ACE Is and ARBs in combination, or new therapeutic modalities such as direct renin inhibition with aliskiren, recently approved for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "160": "Various ocular diseases like glaucoma, conjunctivitis, and dry eye syndrome require frequent drug administration. Poor ocular bioavailability of drugs (< 1%) from conventional eye drops is due mainly to the precorneal loss factors that include rapid tear turnover, nonproductive absorption, transient residence time in the cul-de-sac, and the relative impermeability of the drugs to corneal epithelial membrane. These problems may be overcome by the use of in situ gel-forming systems that are instilled as drops into the eye and undergo a sol-gel transition in the cul-de-sac. Our present work describes the formulation and evaluation of an ocular delivery system of timolol maleate based on the concept of both temperature and pH-triggered in situ gelation. Pluronic F-127 (a thermosensitive polymer) in combination with chitosan (pH-sensitive polymer also acts as permeation enhancer) was used as gelling agent. The developed formulation was characterized for various in vitro parameters e.g., clarity, gelation temperature and pH, isotonicity, sterility, rheological behavior, drug release profile, transcorneal permeation profile, and ocular irritation. Developed formulation was clear, isotonic solution, that converted into gel at temperatures above 35 degrees C and pH 6.9-7.0. A significant higher drug transport across corneal membrane and increased ocular retention time was observed using the developed formulation. The developed system is a viable alternative to conventional eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma and various other ocular diseases.",

The study comprised 30 patients, aged 37-49 years with stable angina. Patients received carvedilol in escalating doses of 12.5 mg/24 h, 25 mg/24 h, and 50 mg/24 h for 4 weeks each. The control group was matched for age and gender, and consisted of 12 healthy volunteers, aged 39-49 years. Blood samples were collected from the cubital vein before and 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the therapy from the patients and once from the control group. For all the subjects, the superoxide dismutase (SOD-1), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) activities in the erythrocytes and the antioxidant activity of the blood plasma were determined. The enzymatic antioxidative defence was significantly decreased in patients with stable angina in comparison to the healthy subjects. During the carvedilol therapy, an increase in the SOD-1, GSH-Px and CAT activities was observed. Moreover, 8 and 12 weeks after carvedilol therapy, the GSH-Px activity did not differ significantly from that observed in the group of healthy subjects. Carvedilol also increased the plasma antioxidative activity in patients with stable angina, but its level remained significantly lower than in the control group. In conclusion, carvedilol enhances antioxidant defense mechanisms in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris.",

Persons with HF and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should have maintenance of sinus rhythm, treatment of hypertension, myocardial ischemia, dyslipidemia, and anemia, slowing of the ventricular rate below 90 bpm, and reduction of salt overload. First-line drug treatment in the management of these persons is the use of loop diuretics combined with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. If persons are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors because of cough, angioneurotic edema, rash, or altered taste sensation, angiotensin II type I receptor antagonists (ARBs) should be given. If HF persists despite diuretics, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine should be administered. Beta blockers, verapamil, diltiazem, and digoxin may be used to slow a rapid ventricular rate in persons with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Digoxin should not be used in persons with HF in sinus rhythm with normal LVEF. Exercise training should be encouraged in persons with mild to moderate HF to improve functional status and to decrease symptoms.",

Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed.

    "165": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common and disabling condition with morbidity and mortality that increase dramatically with advancing age. There is some evidence available about beta-blocker therapy in the elderly. The Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure (SENIORS) and retrospective subgroup (elderly) analyses of landmark clinical trials in stable systolic heart failure have provided data supporting the use of beta-blocker as baseline therapy in heart failure in the elderly. However, beta-blocker is still less frequently used in elderly compared to younger patients. There are many reasons, one of which is that available data on elderly patients are not as convincing as those pertaining to their younger counterparts. There is uncertainty or disagreement about whether beta-blockers are equally beneficial and well tolerated in elderly heart failure patients as in younger ones. In other words, the level of evidence regarding beta-blocker therapy in the elderly is not regarded as high as that in younger patients. Indeed, the senior heart failure population, which in fact comprises the majority of all heart failure patients, is in general less well studied, both experimentally and clinically, than younger populations. Both clinical studies and experience indicate good tolerability in the use of beta-blocker in the elderly. Although beta-blockers are well tolerated by the elderly, target doses (based on previous clinical trials) may be difficult to achieve. The question is whether we should use the same target dose in the elderly as that in younger patients. Theoretically, the most effective dose is the highest dose tolerated, which may differ across different age groups. Is it time to abandon the \"target dose\" for the \"highest dose tolerated\"? The time has come to carry out active research to achieve better documentation of evidence based heart failure management in the elderly for the benefit of a large number of elderly patients with heart failure. We need clinical trial data that show definite improvement in outcomes as well as a clear-cut, favourable benefit-risk analysis involving beta-blockers in typical older heart failure patients irrespective of comorbidity and polypharmacy. Until the above is available, it may be wiser to adhere to beta-blocker therapy, which at present is better documented than other heart failure therapies in the elderly.",

Target doses were reached in 49% of the patients for ACE-I, but in only 18% for beta-blockers and in 9% for ARBs. Multivariate analyses showed that age >75 years was an independent factor associated with under-prescription of ACE-I-ARBs, beta-blockers or spironolactone.

For the determination of the enantiomeric purity of timolol European Pharmacopoeia prescribes an HPLC method using chiral stationary phase. However, the use of chiral capillary zone electrophoresis for the determination of the enantiomeric purity is of pharmaceutical interest.

In the current work, we determined the contribution of specific Ca2+ pathways to an alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis in primary cortical neurons from an adult triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model of AD that exhibits intraneuronal accumulation of beta-amyloid proteins. Resting free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)), as measured with Ca2+-selective microelectrodes, was greatly elevated in neurons from 3xTg-AD and APP(SWE) mouse strains when compared with their respective non-transgenic neurons, while there was no alteration in the resting membrane potential. In the absence of the extracellular Ca2+, the [Ca2+](i) returned to near normal levels in 3xTg-AD neurons, demonstrating that extracellular Ca2+contributed to elevated [Ca2+](i). Application of nifedipine, or a non-L-type channel blocker, SKF-96365, partially reduced [Ca2+](i). Blocking the ryanodine receptors, with ryanodine or FLA-365 had no effect, suggesting that these channels do not contribute to the elevated [Ca2+](i). Conversely, inhibition of inositol trisphosphate receptors with xestospongin C produced a partial reduction in [Ca2+](i). These results demonstrate that an elevation in resting [Ca2+](i), contributed by aberrant Ca2+entry and release pathways, should be considered a major component of the abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis associated with AD.",

Although the maximum plasma concentration was higher for the tablet form than the TDDS (77.67 +/- 23.33 vs 51.16 +/- 16.61 ng/mL), the variable absorption profile, which is a characteristic feature of oral therapy, was quite evident.

    "195": "Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem among the elderly. The syndrome of HF may arise in the presence of either a depressed or apparently normal left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The latter entity is more common in the elderly. In elderly patients with HF, prescription of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist may raise concerns regarding efficacy and tolerability. Because of these concerns, but also as a result of a paucity of published data, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are under-prescribed to elderly patients with HF in general practice. We review the evidence regarding the efficacy and tolerability of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy in elderly patients with HF. We found three major sources of evidence: one prospective, randomised controlled trial (RCT), SENIORS (Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure); a subgroup meta-analysis of elderly patients included in systolic HF trials; and a large number of observational studies. SENIORS showed that the third-generation beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nebivolol reduces the risk of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular admission in elderly patients (aged > or =70 years) with HF and a broad range of LVEF. The subgroup meta-analysis of RCTs showed that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists reduce mortality in elderly patients (aged 60-80 years) with systolic HF, and that the benefit is similar to that observed in non-elderly patients (aged <60 years). The observational studies showed a beneficial effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in elderly populations in daily practice, including those with depressed and preserved LVEF. However, the effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on all-cause mortality may be lower in very elderly patients (aged >75 years). Approximately two-thirds of elderly patients with HF tolerate a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, but only 40-70% of the target doses recommended in RCTs are achieved. Some clinical variables may predict low beta-adrenoceptor antagonist tolerability, such as low systolic blood pressure, higher New York Heart Association HF severity class, advanced age and ischaemic cause of HF. Furthermore, prescription of a high diuretic dose and calcium channel antagonists may also decrease beta-adrenoceptor antagonist tolerability. However, it is difficult to identify on clinical grounds patients intolerant to any beta-adrenoceptor antagonist dose. Low-dose therapy (<50% target dose) may be effective in an elderly population with HF, but prescription of at least a medium dose (> or =50% target dose) may achieve a higher benefit. In conclusion, although elderly patients with HF take lower doses of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, these agents are still effective and overall well tolerated in this population. Elderly patients with HF should therefore not be denied beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy. The dilemma relies on dose-benefit balance, as higher doses would be more effective but may raise tolerability concerns. The beneficial effects of use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in elderly patients with HF and preserved LVEF need to be further confirmed in large RCTs.", 
    "196": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual loss. This potentially blinding disease is a progressive optic neuropathy associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Initial therapy for glaucoma typically consists of topical medications or laser treatment to lower IOP. Frequently, more than one medication is required to achieve adequate control of IOP. However, more medications means more bottles and greater complexity for the patient. There are several potential benefits of fixed combination medications compared with using the individual components separately. These include a reduction in the total number of drops and preservative instilled per day, cost savings, improved tolerability and compliance and avoiding the washout effect resulting from rapid-sequence instillation of multiple drops. Attempts to develop effective fixed combinations of glaucoma medications date back several decades. In recent years, fixed combinations of commonly paired drugs have been approved by various regulatory bodies in different countries and have gained wide acceptance. Current commercially available, fixed combination drugs include the topical beta-adrenoceptor antagonist timolol 0.5% combined with a prostaglandin, a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor or an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist. Although there is no uniformity among registration trial designs, most published literature compares the efficacy of the fixed combination to the individual components and to concomitant use of both components. Various factors inherent to study design such as medication run-in, washout periods and peak and trough effects have to be taken into consideration when analysing the demonstrated efficacy of fixed combinations. Fixed combination treatments offer effective IOP control while reducing the washout effect and exposure to preservatives. They are also convenient. However, fixed combinations also remove the possibility of titrating the individual components both in terms of concentration and timing of administration. In addition, fixed combinations might not always provide the same efficacy as proper use of the individual components. The clinician must make individualised assessments when weighing the convenience of these medications against their limitations for specific patients.", 
    "197": "Congestive heart failure is a growing public health problem worldwide, particularly in the elderly population, in whom it has a substantial impact on quality of life and survival. Despite the fact that heart failure is the most common reason for hospitalisation over the age of 65 years, most clinical trials have excluded the elderly population. This is unfortunate because it may not be generally assumed that elderly patients are similar to younger ones. Nonspecific symptoms and co-morbidities in the elderly may make diagnosis of heart failure difficult. In addition, physiology changes with age, polypharmacy complicates therapy and the aim of therapy may change in the presence of co-morbidities such as cancer or dementia. Furthermore, drug interactions and adverse effects are frequent in heart failure in general, but increase significantly with age. Nevertheless, there is little evidence that treatment of heart failure should be fundamentally different in elderly patients compared with younger patients, although careful monitoring of medical therapy is of particular importance in elderly heart failure patients. Therefore, general guidelines on diagnosis and therapy of heart failure also apply to elderly patients, but therapy may need to be adjusted to cater for individual needs, potential interactions and altered elimination of drugs. This article summarises the evidence available for treatment in elderly patients with heart failure, discusses potential differences in elderly subjects compared with their younger counterparts and provides recommendations for clinical practice.", 
    "198": "To systematically review published clinical trials of the pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD).", 
    "199": "We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for published English-language medical literature. Our review focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and corresponding metaanalyses.", 
    "200": "The pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD has been studied with numerous RCTs. The largest number of studies has focused on antipsychotics. Data are of reasonably high quality and indicate that risperidone and olanzapine are more effective than placebo for institutionalized patients with severe agitation, aggression, and psychosis. The efficacy of antipsychotics is counterbalanced by safety concerns that include cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine appear to have modest benefits for patients with mildly to moderately severe symptoms. Antidepressants are effective for treating depression in AD, but more data are required to determine the efficacy of trazodone and citalopram for agitation and aggression. Carbamazepine appears to be efficacious, although side effects and concerns about drug-drug interactions limit its use. The data do not support the use of valproate. Benzodiazepines should only be used for short-term, as-needed use. There are insufficient data on other pharmacologic interventions, such as beta blockers, buspirone, and estrogen preparations.", 
    "201": "Although there have been numerous well-designed studies of the pharmacotherapy of neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD, safer and more effective treatments are urgently needed.", 
    "202": "Discussed is the actual controversy concerning the role of P-adrenergic blocking agents in the treatment of arterial hypertension. The author argues that these drugs are not suitable for elderly hypertensive patients, particularly in primary stroke prevention. The diabetogenic and atherogenic potential of these agents is marginal, and there are no marked differences between the available P blockers (atenolol has possibly some slight disadvantages). However, for the time being these drugs remain in the first line antihypertensive armamentarium for the younger hypertensive patients; for compelling indications or intolerance of other antihypertensives should be prescribed to any patient, as Croatian Society of Hypertension concluded in 1999.", 
    "203": "The authors examined the cardioprotective effect of landiolol, an ultra short-acting, highly selective beta1-blocker, and its role in cardiac work, antioxidative effect, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion.", 
    "204": "Isolated guinea pig hearts were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion by stopping the perfusion for 45 min and reperfusing. Before the ischemia, hearts were treated with landiolol (20, 100, or 500 microM) for 15 min (LAN group). In another set of experiments, before ischemia, hearts were washed out for 15 min after treatment with landiolol (WO group). In other hearts, the tissue concentration of malondialdehyde was measured after reperfusion. We also examined the phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser(16) and Thr(17)residues to evaluate the SR function.", 
    "205": "After 90 min of reperfusion, left ventricular pressure (LVP) was restored significantly in the LAN-500 microM group regardless of heart rate. However, the improvement in recovery in LVP disappeared in the WO group. The tissue malondialdehyde levels were decreased in the LAN group compared with those in the control group. In the control group, the phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser(16) and Thr(17) residues was markedly increased after reperfusion. Landiolol at 500 microM suppressed the increase of phosphorylation at Ser(16) residues.", 
    "206": "The present study demonstrated that landiolol had a lipid peroxidation-reducing effect and suppressed the increase in phospholamban phosphorylation at the Ser(16) residue in hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. These findings indicate that landiolol may have an anti-ischemic effect, via an antioxidant effect and/or via preserving SR function during the ischemic period."
