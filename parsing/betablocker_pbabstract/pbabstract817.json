    "0": "In this experimental study on rabbits, we compare the haemostatic and histological changes observed in animals with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by thrombin perfusion (100 u/kg/hr during 3 hours) with or without preventive administration of alpha and beta receptor stimulating or blocking agents. Both alpha and beta receptor stimulating agents enhance the disorders induced by thrombin alone, while alpha or beta blocking agents reduce them. This favourable action is still more pronounced with the combination of these two last types of drugs. The modifications observed appear to be related to changes in platelet function.", 
    "1": "The hypothesis that physiological and developmental regulatory mechanisms are similar has been presented. Well-known developmental systems chosen illustrate the capability of the model to suggest a simple mechanism underlying the effects on development of a diverse group of chemicals. This hypothesis might be applied to other systems including the induction of the lens, limb regeneration, and the induction of the head of hydra (124). I have proposed this hypothesis not only because it permits consideration of a complex and varied array of experimental observations as reflections of a simple basic biochemical mechanism, but because recent technical advances in instrumentation and methods allow it to be directly tested. The fluorescent antibody method for the cytochemical measurement of cyclic nucleotides provides a means for investigating changes in the concentrations of cyclic nucleotides in developing cells and could also be used to detect neurotransmitters in developing cells. Similarly, the scanning electron microscope in the emitted x-ray mode provides a method for measuring changes in the content and distribution of cations within developing cells. The hypothesis presented here suggests pleasing asceticism on the part of eukaryotes. It suggests that simple derivatives of metabolites, including neurotransmitters and cyclic nucleotides, are linked together as regulatory molecules throughout the eukaryotes. The neurotransmitters are suggested to have a more general role in information transmission in eukaryotes than is generally accepted. They are hypothesized to have progressed during evolution from being intracellular messengers to a role as intercellular messengers for the relatively slow communication of developmental informatbn; and, finally, this process has culminated with their participation in the rapid intercellular communication mediated by nerves. The thought that the complex pictures of physiological regulation and of the construction of a complex multicellular organism like man might be painted with so few colors is quite satisfying.", 
    "2": "1. Circulatory effects of deep inspirations, blocked expirations and constant endotracheal positive pressure inflations were studied in six conscious dogs under comparable geometries of the pulmonary vascular bed, i.e. at equal transpulmonary pressures (around 10.2 cm H(2)O) and similar lung volumes.2. In order to characterize these effects, we measured beat-by-beat left and right ventricular ejections, pulmonary arterial, left atrial and aortic mean transmural pressures, and concomitant intrathoracic and tracheal pressures. Changes in pulmonary-left heart blood volume were also computed.3. During inspiration when intrathoracic pressure became more negative, there was a slight increase in right ventricular output (+15%; P < 0.1) and always a net decrease in left ventricular output (-25%; P < 0.01) despite a significant increase in mean transmural left atrial pressure (+3 cm H(2)O, i.e. +40%; P < 0.005). It is concluded that the more negative intrathoracic pressure increases the left ventricular outflow impedance and that an inspiratory increase in pulmonary vascular capacity cannot explain the observed reduction in left ventricular output since this reduction occurs together with an increase in left ventricular filling pressure.4. During blocked expiration when intrathoracic pressure was positive, decreases in right ventricular output (-17%; P < 0.05) and in pulmonary-left heart blood volume (-12 ml.; P < 0.05) were observed while right ventricular outflow impedance increased. After an initial augmentation in left ventricular output (despite a concomitant progressive decrease in mean transmural left atrial pressure), left ventricular output also decreased (-17%; P < 0.05). Such circulatory changes were similar but less marked than those observed under constant positive pressure inflations. These observations suggest that the decrease in venous return (and consequently in right ventricular output) following the increase in intrathoracic pressure is the leading factor which overshadows the augmentation in left ventricular output associated with the simultaneous decrease in left ventricular outflow impedance.5. Similar experiments performed on two additional dogs in acute conditions showed the same circulatory effects before and after pharmacological blockade. These observations therefore confirm that mechanical factors play a leading part during these respiratory manoeuvres.", 
    "3": "1 High concentrations of pilocarpine and methacholine consistently lowered the potencies of a series of adrenoceptor agonists as shown by displacement of complete cumulative dose-effect curves for their positive chronotropic action on rat isolated atria. The order of potency of the agonists was characteristic of beta-adrenoceptor activation and this was converted to the type which characterizes alpha-adrenoceptor activation when pilocarpine was present.2 Propranolol effectively blocked the adrenoceptor agonists in the presence of pilocarpine and phentolamine abolished the antagonistic actions of pilocarpine. Atropine, which by itself did not affect the action of the adrenoceptor agonists, abolished both the bradycardia and antagonism produced by pilocarpine.3 It is concluded that pilocarpine antagonizes adrenoceptor agonists by muscarinic cholinoceptor activation without involving classical adrenoceptors.", 
    "4": "1. The release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) has been studied in the chloralose anaesthetized cat after microinjection of various agents directly into the brain, in particular the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SON). The concentration of ADH in jugular venous blood was determined using the waterloaded, alcohol anaesthetized rat assay. The position of the microinjection cannula was located post mortem in stained brain sections.2. Nicotine, noradrenaline (NA) and hypertonic saline caused release of ADH, whereas microinjections of isotonic saline did not affect the blood level of the hormone.3. Nicotine administered to other sites in the central nervous system (C.N.S.) could also cause ADH release. Hypertonic saline proved to be an ineffective stimulus at all the tested sites outside the supraoptic region.4. The ganglion-blocking agents hexamethonium and pempidine inhibited the releasing action of nicotine at the SON in most of the experiments. These blocking drugs had no effect on osmotic release. When administered alone, both hexamethonium and pempidine had variable, but analogous effects on the hormone output.5. The alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking drug, phentolamine, stimulated ADH release, but the beta-receptor blocking drug, propranolol, had no such effect. Both drugs appeared to have inhibitory action on noradrenergic release of ADH, but neither had a consistent effect on the osmotic release of the hormone.", 
    "5": "Epinephrine promotes spontaneous activity in cardiac Purkinje fibers through its action on the pacemaker potassium current (i(KK2)). The mechanism of the acceleratory effect was studied by means of a voltage clamp technique. The results showed that the hormone speeds the deactivation of i(KK2) during pacemaker activity by displacing the kinetic parameters of i(KK2) toward less negative potentials. This depolarizing voltage shift is the sole explanation of the acceleratory effect since epinephrine did not alter the rectifier properties of i(KK2), or the underlying inward leakage current, or the threshold for i(NNa). The dose dependence of the voltage shift in the i(KK2) activation curve was similar in 1.8 and 5.4 mM [Ca](o). The maximal voltage shift (usually approximately 20 mV) was produced by epinephrine concentrations of > 10(-6) M. The half-maximal effect was evoked by 60 nM epinephrine, nearly an order of magnitude lower than required for half-maximal effect on the secondary inward current (Carmeliet and Vereecke, 1969). The beta-blocker propranolol (10(-6) M) prevented the effect of epinephrine (10(-7)M) but by itself gave no voltage shift. Epinephrine shifted the activation rate coefficient alpha(8) to a greater extent than the deactivation rate coefficient beta(8), and often steepened the voltage dependence of the steady-state activation curve. These deviations from simple voltage shift behavior were discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of epinephrine's action on the i(KK2) channel.", 
    "6": "1 The effect of isoprenaline on pentagastrin-induced gastric secretion was studied in conscious rats with Heidenhain pouches. The influence of isoprenaline on pentagastrin-induced release and formation of gastric mucosal histamine was also examined.2 Isoprenaline strongly inhibited pentagastrin-induced acid secretion, an inhibition which could not be overcome by increasing the dose of pentagastrin.3 Propranolol blocked the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline on pentagastrin-induced acid secretion.4 Isoprenaline enhanced pepsin secretion induced by pentagastrin, an effect which was blocked by propranolol.5 Isoprenaline reduced the increase in formation and release of gastric mucosal histamine following pentagastrin infusion, an inhibitory influence which was almost completely blocked by propranolol.6 The inhibition by isoprenaline of pentagastrin-induced acid secretion is tentatively related to alterations in gastric mucosal histamine occurring simultaneously."
