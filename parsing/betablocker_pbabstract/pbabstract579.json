    "0": "Elderly patients as a group have a less favorable response to beta blockers than younger patients do. However, there are patients who do respond, and associated conditions that can be treated with beta blockers (especially angina pectoris and postmyocardial infarction prophylaxis) are common in the elderly. The place of the calcium channel blockers in an antihypertensive regimen is not clear; they can be used alone, but their long-term efficacy is probably increased by concomitant diuretic treatment.", 
    "1": "Esmolol is a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker that is rapidly metabolized by blood and liver esterases. The beta-receptor and hemodynamic effects of esmolol were determined in a group of 12 healthy men and were compared with those induced by both oral and intravenous propranolol. Esmolol was rapidly effective in inducing at least 90% of steady-state beta-blockade within 5 minutes of either initiating or changing the esmolol infusion rate. More importantly, when esmolol infusion was discontinued the beta-blockade had totally disappeared by 18 minutes after esmolol, 300 micrograms/kg/min, and had been reduced by 50% after 750 micrograms/kg/min. In contrast, 30 minutes after discontinuation of a propranolol infusion, there was no change in the level of beta-blockade. Propranolol was much more potent at blocking isoproterenol-induced tachycardia (dose ratio 33.5 +/- 2.5) than was even the highest dose (750 micrograms/kg/min) of esmolol (dose ratio 13.1 +/- 1.0). The same dose of intravenous propranolol was approximately equipotent to oral propranolol, 40 mg every 8 hours (dose ratio 33.5 +/- 2.5 and 34.5 +/- 3.6, respectively). In contrast, propranolol, 40 mg every 8 hours, and esmolol, 300 micrograms/kg/min, were equipotent in antagonizing exercise-induced tachycardia (40.1% +/- 2.3% and 42.7% +/- 3.2%, respectively). Esmolol had striking hypotensive effects. Systolic blood pressure fell by 20 mm Hg during esmolol infusions of 750 micrograms/kg/min. Esmolol appears to be a potent beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist with a particularly strong hypotensive effect. It is likely to be very useful in the treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients and may be useful in the emergency treatment of hypertension.", 
    "2": "Five healthy young men received, in a double-blind fashion, single oral doses of 10 mg betaxolol, 40 mg betaxolol, 50 mg atenolol, 40 mg propranolol, and placebo. After the dose each received serial 12-minute infusions of isoproterenol sulfate through the dose range 0.5 to 32 micrograms/min until the heart rate rose by 40 bpm or the subject could not tolerate the effects of the infusion. Heart rate, finger tremor, blood pressure, and forearm blood flow were measured after each infusion. Dose-response curves were constructed for the changes in these parameters with increasing doses of isoproterenol. The ascending order of potency of the drugs in preventing the changes in heart rate, finger tremor, diastolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow, and forearm vascular resistance induced by isoproterenol was placebo, 10 mg betaxolol, 50 mg atenolol, 40 mg betaxolol, and 40 mg propranolol. The ascending order of potency of the drugs in preventing the change in systolic blood pressure induced by isoproterenol was placebo, 10 mg betaxolol, 50 mg atenolol, 40 mg propranolol, and 40 mg betaxolol. Betaxolol, 10 mg, is equally cardioselective to 50 mg atenolol and at a dose of 40 mg betaxolol also exhibits cardioselectivity.", 
    "3": "Conscious adult ewes prepared with nonocclusive indwelling vascular catheters were used to determine the mechanism by which heart rate increases during central administration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Heart rate increased 14 bpm during steady-state intracarotid infusion of PGE2, 10 ng/kg/min (P less than 0.05). Intravenous atropine methyl bromide, 1 mg/kg, increased heart rate 26 bpm (P less than 0.05) 5 min after injection. Heart rate remained elevated 30 min after injection. The heart rate response to PGE2 plus atropine was greater than the heart rate response to either atropine or PGE2 alone (P less than 0.05). Propranolol, 1 mg/kg bolus plus intravenous infusion, 0.025 mg/kg/min, did not change resting heart rate. Propranolol attenuated but did not abolish the increase in heart rate caused by intracarotid PGE2. Although heart rate increased in response to PGE2 after administration of either propranolol or atropine alone, the combination of propranolol and atropine prevented any further increase in heart rate during subsequent PGE2 infusion. The increase in heart rate when all three drugs were given together was not different from the increase observed during atropine alone. Thus, both beta-adrenergic activation and muscarinic deactivation contribute to the PGE2-induced tachycardia.", 
    "4": "Our studies demonstrated that beta-adrenergic agonists stimulate the release of GH from rat anterior pituitary (AP) cells in vitro. Concentration-response experiments with beta-adrenergic agonists demonstrated that beta 2-adrenergic receptors mediated this phasic GH release, while having no apparent effect on PRL or LH release. The ACTH response to beta-adrenergic agonists was equivocal. Half-maximal stimulation of GH release occurred at 14 +/- 2 (+/-SE) nM isoproterenol, 160 +/- 30 nM epinephrine, and over 1 microM l-norepinephrine (n = 4). Direct binding studies in membrane particulates of rat AP confirmed receptors of the beta 2-subtype. Iodocyanopindolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors of rat AP yielded a dissociation constant of 4.6 +/- 0.1 pM and a maximal capacity of 1.9 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein (n = 3). In contrast, porcine AP contained beta 1-adrenergic receptors. These results support the hypothesis that the endogenous beta 2-adrenergic agonist l-epinephrine may be a GH-releasing factor of physiological significance in the rat.", 
    "5": "Effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the changes in rectal temperature (RT), heat production (HP) and noradrenaline (NA) concentration in the submaxillary salivary glands (SMSG) of rats exposed to heat (45 degrees C) was studied. Propranolol (P) (15 mg/kg i.p.) decreased the tolerance to heat. The survival time of propranolol-treated (PT) rats was 30 min shorter. The temperature curve of control rats exposed to heat can be divided into three phases: a rapid rise in RT; a plateau (TP) and a prelethal increase. In PT animals, under identical conditions, TP disappears and RT further rises accelerating death. In the initial phase of heat exposure, HP was markedly decreased to the same extent in both experimental groups; but after 20 min HP increases in PT rats. The content of NA from SMSG both in the initial phase and in the TP phase is modified in PT rats.", 
    "6": "The cardiac and renal hemodynamic effects of SE2395, a beta-blocking agent, were examined after intravenous administration (50 micrograms/kg) in normotensive conscious dogs. Beta-blocking action of SE2395 was evidenced by a reduction in heart rate and cardiac output without change in the mean arterial pressure. An increase in glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) and a slight enhancement in effective renal plasma flow (para-aminohippurate clearance) were observed without attendant decreases in plasma renin activity. An increase in urinary sodium excretion was also observed; urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion was, however, unchanged. We conclude that at effective beta-blocking dosage SE2395 does not induce any detrimental effect on renal function in conscious dogs.", 
    "7": "Nicardipine, a new calcium antagonist, was tested in a 14-week double-blind trial including 15 outpatients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. They were randomly assigned to nicardipine (20-30 mg three times daily) or placebo as first-step treatment. When necessary but always after a minimum of 4 weeks, pindolol (15 mg/day) was combined with nicardipine or placebo. At the end of step 1 (85 +/- 6 days with nicardipine vs. 58 +/- 6 days with placebo, p less than 0.01), nicardipine induced larger drops in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) than the placebo (21 +/- 2.5 vs 1.4 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, and 13 +/- 2 vs. 3.5 +/- 1.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, respectively). In the nicardipine group (n = 57), 53% of patients had controlled blood pressure (SBP less than 160 mm Hg and DBP less than 95 mm Hg) versus 17% in the placebo group (n = 47), p less than 0.001. There was no significant correlation between the decrease in blood pressure and the age of patients. The most common side effects in the nicardipine group were flushes (12%), headache (8%), ankle edema (5%), and asthenia (4%). When blood pressure was not brought under control and pindolol was prescribed as the second-step treatment, the nicardipine group (n = 52) displayed larger drops in SBP and DBP than the placebo group (n = 40) (27 +/- 5 vs. 15 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01, and 18 +/- 1 vs. 9 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.001, respectively). These results show that a calcium antagonist is useful for first-step treatment of hypertension.", 
    "8": "The effects of the adrenergic antihypertensive drugs propranolol, clonidine, alpha-methyldopa, urapidil, indoramin, and prazosin on the relative rate of sterol synthesis were studied in freshly isolated human mononuclear leukocytes. Incubation of cells for 6 h in a medium containing lipid-depleted serum led to a threefold increase in the incorporation of [14C]acetate or tritiated water into sterols. (-)-Epinephrine added at zero time to the incubation medium inhibited the relative rate of sterol synthesis by 32% at a concentration of 1 mumol/L. The non-specific beta-blocker propranolol, added at equimolar concentrations, almost abolished the epinephrine-induced suppression. The beta-blocker per se had no effect on the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols up to a concentration of 1 mumol/l. The alpha 2-agonist clonidine and alpha-methyldopa, added in increasing concentrations at zero time, inhibited the relative rate of sterol synthesis, yielding a sigmoidal log dose-effect curve. The suppression was 43 and 24%, respectively, at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. The alpha 1-antagonists indoramin, prazosin, and urapidil, up to a concentration of 10 mumol/L, had no effect per se, or on the epinephrine-induced suppression of the relative synthesis rate of sterols. The results give evidence that various antihypertensive adrenergic drugs, depending on their action on beta- or alpha-adrenergic receptors, have different effects on cholesterol biosynthesis and therefore may affect cellular cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "9": "We characterized the beta-adrenoceptor subtype in isolated ring preparations of small intramyocardial flow-regulating (resistance) arteries (i.d. congruent to 239 micrometers) from rats by using beta 2 adrenoceptor agonists and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists exhibiting selectivity towards either beta 1- (pafenolol) or beta-adrenoceptors (ICI 118,551). The relative order of potency of selected agonists in producing beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-5) M) contracted coronary vessels was: isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline = adrenaline. ICI 118,551, but not pafenolol, relaxed coronary resistance vessels precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-5) M) or high potassium (125 mM) solutions. The IC50 values were 8.59 x 10(-6) M and 2.96 x 10(-5) M, respectively (p less than 0.0005). This indicates that ICI 118,551 had membrane-stabilizing effects. Both ICI 118,551 and pafenolol antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner the isoprenaline-induced relaxation of prostaglandin F2 alpha (10(-5) M) contracted coronary resistance vessels. The slopes and regression lines of the Schild plots were not significantly different from unity and the calculated pA2 values were 7.55 and 6.59 (p less than 0.005) for pafenolol and ICI 118,551, respectively. The results are compatible with the suggestion that beta-adrenoceptors mediating relaxation in rat coronary resistance vessels belong to the beta 1-adrenoceptor subtype.", 
    "10": "The effect of AQ-AH 208 [3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-(3 - ((2-(3,4-dimethoxphenyl)ethyl)-amino- methyl)propyl)-1(2H)-isoquinolinone], a new selective bradycardic agent, on coronary collateral perfusion was investigated in anesthetized open-chest dogs following acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. AQ-AH 208 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), propranolol (0.3 mg/kg i.v.), and N-dimethylpropranolol (DMP; 2.5 mg/kg i.v.) were equieffective in reducing heart rate approximately 15%. AQ-AH 208 increased collateral flow to the subepicardium, midmyocardium, and subendocardium by 24, 46, and 35% (p less than 0.05), respectively, while propranolol and DMP had no effect. Atrial pacing to predrug levels in the presence of AQ-AH 208 reduced the increases in collateral flow to the different myocardial layers to 16, 25, and 30%, respectively; however, these increases were still significantly greater than control. It is concluded that part of the AQ-AH 208-induced increase in collateral perfusion is due to an increase in diastolic duration. The nature of the frequency-independent component of the effect is unknown but may be explained by a selective decrease in extravascular coronary resistance in the ischemic zone or an increase in the conductance of large epicardial coronary or collateral vessels.", 
    "11": "Effects of nipradilol (K-351), a newly developed antihypertensive agent, on electrophysiological properties of the heart were examined in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts and in superfused guinea pig ventricular muscles. In rabbit hearts, nipradilol at concentrations greater than 10(-5) M caused a significant prolongation of atrio-His bundle conduction time (AH) as well as His bundle-ventricular conduction time (HV), whereas heart rate (HR), functional refractory period of atrioventricular node (FRPVM) were unaffected. The intensity of the negative dromotropic effect of nipradilol was less than half that of propranolol. Isoproterenol-induced increase in HR and a shortening of AH, FRPAV, ERPVM were inhibited competitively by pretreatment with nipradilol at greater than 10(-8) M. Nipradilol was about two to three times more potent than propranolol in antagonizing isoproterenol-induced effects. In guinea pig ventricular muscles, nipradilol at a concentration greater than 10(-5) M caused a decrease of the maximum upstroke velocity (VMAX) of the action potential without affecting resting potential and action potential duration. In the presence of nipradilol, trains of stimuli at rates higher than 0.2 Hz led to an exponential decline in VMAX to achieve a new plateau. The time constant for the recovery from use-dependent block was 4.3 s. These findings suggest that nipradilol may have a potent cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blocking action and, at extremely high concentrations, quinidine-like inhibitory effects on the cardiac excitability and conductivity.", 
    "12": "When a decision to treat a given patient is taken, the embarrassing position arises of deciding which drug should first be prescribed. How can the safest choice be made? Should the physician follow a pathophysiological or an empirical approach? There is no doubt that the most rational approach would consist of matching the pharmacological properties of the drug with the pathophysiological disturbances of the patient. However, these are complex and variable, and their precise assessment in every hypertensive patient is hardly practicable. On the other hand, the pharmacological properties of drugs are often multiple, and sometimes imperfectly understood. The practical impossibility of obtaining a satisfactory pathophysiological profile of each hypertensive patient in order to choose the most suitable drug has strengthened the trend toward formulating and using stepped-care programmes. The philosophy behind these is that of lowering blood pressure with agents most likely to be effective with a minimum of untoward effects, of progressing from a simple start, generally prescribing a single drug at a low dose, to more complex therapeutic regimens. There is some evident soundness in this approach, but stepped-care programmes are sometimes criticized as dogmatic, and are contrasted with the individualized approach, the custom-tailoring provided by pathophysiological profiling. Undoubtedly, the first stepped-care programmes, as formulated in the USA in the 1970s, giving no other first choice than a thiazide diuretic, were rigid and had limitations. On the other hand, the 1978 WHO guidelines were more flexible, suggesting a first choice between either a diuretic or a beta-blocker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Depolarization of cardiac muscle is achieved by 'fast inward current' through channels which are inactivated within about 1 ms. When the cells are repolarized the process of inactivation of fast channels is rapidly reversed. The class 1 anti-arrhythmic drugs delay the disappearance of inactivation until long after repolarization is complete. In theory, it should be possible to produce a similar extension of refractory period by delaying the repolarization itself. Quinidine and disopyramide caused minor delays of repolarization, but both were primarily class 1 agents, and in addition had undesirable anticholinergic activity. Amiodarone, already in use for many years as an antianginal drug, prolonged action potential duration (APD) and was shown to have an anti-arrhythmic action in rabbits, dogs and man. Although prolongation of APD lengthens QT, a long QT may be caused by phenomena other than prolonged APD, such as heterogeneity of sympathetic drive. Association of long QT with arrhythmia does not, therefore, invalidate the principle that homogeneously prolonged APD should be anti-arrhythmic. In practice, amiodarone, bretylium, sotalol, thyroidectomy, and long-term beta-blockade prolong APD, and are associated with low incidence of arrhythmia. Many mechanisms controlling cardiac repolarization have been proposed, but how repolarization is delayed by individual agents is not fully elucidated.", 
    "14": "Three patients who developed torsade de pointes associated with antiarrhythmic or psychotropic drugs are described, and the electrocardiographic characteristics, clinical presentation, predisposing factors, and management of this form of ventricular tachycardia are reviewed. The first patient was a 56-year-old schizophrenic man receiving thioridazine hydrochloride, trifluoperazine hydrochloride, and benztropine mesylate who was admitted to a hospital after a syncopal episode. Subsequently, the patient experienced several episodes of ventricular tachycardia combined with multifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and torsade de pointes; the arrhythmias were attributed to antipsychotic therapy. The second patient was a 69-year-old man who experienced ventricular tachycardia that progressed to ventricular fibrillation 41 days after surgery. Quinidine sulfate probably induced the ventricular tachycardia, which was identified as torsade de pointes. The third patient was a 71-year-old man admitted to the hospital for treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Previous drug therapy with quinidine sulfate and procainamide hydrochloride had been associated with torsade de pointes. Despite unsuccessful treatment of ventricular ectopy, the patient was discharged on maintenance therapy with pindolol, topical nitrates, and phenytoin. No additional episodes of torsade de pointes have been observed. Torsade de pointes is characterized by polymorphous electrocardiographic appearance and delayed repolarization (prolonged QT interval). It may occur in association with a number of disease states and also as a complication of treatment with therapeutic doses of drugs that affect repolarization (quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, and phenothiazines). Clinical outcomes range from asymptomatic, self-terminating arrhythmias to ventricular fibrillation resulting in cardiac arrest. The definitive emergency therapy for torsade de pointes is overdrive pacing; cautious isoproterenol administration can also be used. Lidocaine and bretylium are often ineffective in treating this form of ventricular tachycardia. Potassium and magnesium repletion appear to be essential in abolishing drug-induced torsade de pointes. Drug-induced torsade de pointes is best prevented by avoiding agents known to induce arrhythmias in patients with a pre-existing prolonged QT interval. Periodic serum electrolyte assessment is warranted, and new drugs that prolong the QT interval should be considered potential causative agents of torsade de pointes.", 
    "15": "There is conflicting evidence as to which autonomic receptors mast cells possess and whether the receptors are capable of modulating mediator release. We have studied dog mastocytoma cells because they are available in large numbers in a relatively pure form, unlike normal dog mast cells. Mastocytoma nodules from a dog were excised and disaggregated with collagenase to provide a cell suspension of mastocytoma cells of greater than 92% purity. The presence of autonomic receptors was assessed by both radioligand binding assays and by evaluating pharmacologic modulation of mediator release. In the radioligand binding assays, beta-adrenergic receptors were estimated by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, alpha-adrenergic receptors by [3H]prazosin binding and cholinergic receptors by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. Nonspecific binding was determined in each case by incubation in the presence of the specific antagonists propranolol, phentolamine, and atropine, respectively. The effect of autonomic agonists on immunologic and nonimmunologic histamine release was examined, using the beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and terbutaline, the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine with and without propranolol, and the cholinergic agonist acetylcholine. Dose-response curves were constructed both for the autonomic agonists and the histamine-releasing agents. Results from the radioligand binding and the pharmacologic studies were concordant. These dog mastocytoma cells had a high density of beta-receptors (21,500 +/- 3,300; mean +/- SE beta-receptors/cell, n=5) of which the predominant subtype appeared to be beta2. No evidence was found for the presence of alpha-adrenergic or cholinergic receptors either by direct receptor binding or by their actions on histamine release.", 
    "16": "In 736 patients, 24 hour electrocardiographic recordings were performed 14 to 36 days after acute myocardial infarction before the start of randomized treatment with 320 mg of slow release oxprenolol (n = 358) or placebo (n = 378). Follow-up 24 hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained 5 to 12 days (median 10) and 3, 6 and 12 months after the first administration of the study medication. Oxprenolol-treated patients had a significantly lower daytime heart rate as compared with the placebo group, whereas no difference was found at night. At baseline, 22.1% of the patients allocated to oxprenolol treatment and 29.6% of the placebo group had more than 30 ventricular extrasystoles in 1 hour at least once during 24 hour monitoring; multiform ventricular extrasystoles were present in 58.4 and 62.7%, ventricular couplets in 29.6 and 33.9% and ventricular tachycardia (3 or more consecutive ventricular extrasystoles) in 21.5 and 20.9% of the oxprenolol-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. During the 1 year follow-up period, the prevalence of these arrhythmias did not change significantly in either treatment group. There was a trend toward a reduction in the daytime frequency of ventricular couplets in the oxprenolol group. After 3 and 6 months, only multiform ventricular extrasystoles were significantly less frequent in the oxprenolol group than in the placebo group (47.4 and 42.7% versus 59.7 and 57.9%, respectively). Twelve months after the acute event, however, multiform ventricular extrasystole frequency was the same in both groups of patients (52.1 versus 51.0%, respectively). Thus, oxprenolol had a weak suppressant effect on ventricular tachyarrhythmias in survivors of myocardial infarction.", 
    "17": "The 5-HT receptor subtypes involved in the mediation of reciprocal forepaw treading and the flat body posture induced by the central 5-HT receptor agonist, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT), were examined in intact rats and in rats depleted of monoamines with reserpine. Forepaw treading in non-reserpinised rats was antagonised by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, only at doses in excess of those required for occupation of a large proportion of 5-HT2 receptors in brain, and at which there was significant inhibition of stereotyped sniffing induced by the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine. Since forepaw treading induced by 5-MeODMT was also blocked in intact rats by haloperidol, blockade of the behaviour by ketanserin may more accurately reflect antagonism at dopamine receptors than at 5-HT2 receptors. In reserpinised rats, i.e. with minimised contributions from other monoamine systems, neither forepaw treading nor the flat body posture were significantly altered by ketanserin, haloperidol or the beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonists, betaxolol and ICI 118.551, making a key role for 5-HT2 receptors, dopamine receptors and beta-adrenoceptors unlikely. In contrast, forepaw treading in both reserpinised and non-reserpinised rats was antagonised stereoselectively by pindolol and by spiperone, which interact with 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A recognition sites. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that forepaw treading induced by 5-MeODMT arises by activation of the putative 5-HT1A receptor. Antagonism of the flat body posture by pindolol could be demonstrated only in non-reserpinised rats and the mechanism of induction of this behaviour remains to be established.", 
    "18": "Haematic concentrations of catecholamines were found to be higher in cirrhotic patients with ascites, than cirrhotic patients without ascites and controls. In compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, different forms of sympathetic nervous activity were observed. The high catecholamine values in cirrhotic patients and the activation of the renin angiotensin-aldosterone system suggest the use of beta-blockers to reduce sodium-water retention.", 
    "19": "Other methods for the treatment of anxiety are discussed--psychotherapeutic, behavioural and pharmacological. Among the psychotherapeutic methods are psychoanalytical and supportive therapy, psycho-education, cognitive therapy and paradoxical intention. Behaviour- modifying methods include systematic desensitization, flooding, thought blocking and biofeedback. However, none of these methods in isolation seems to be effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Drugs such as beta-blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs and buspirone are reviewed. Buspirone seems to be as effective as the benzodiazepines in the alleviation of anxiety and may have less untoward effects. A few new drugs that are still being evaluated--fenobam, suriclone, synaptamine, fominoben and tracazolate--are mentioned.", 
    "20": "The effects of short term stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and elevations in intracellular cyclic AMP on nitrendipine-sensitive voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels of skeletal muscle cells in vitro has been studied using both the 45Ca2+ flux technique and [3H] nitrendipine-binding experiments. Isoproterenol increased the nitrendipine-sensitive 45Ca2+ influx under depolarizing conditions. The effects of isoproterenol were additive to those of depolarization and were antagonized by alprenolol. Half-maximal inhibition of 45Ca2+ influx induced both by depolarization and by isoproterenol occurred at a nitrendipine concentration of 1 nM. Treatments that resulted in an increased level of intracellular cyclic AMP, such as treatment with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, theophylline, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or 8-bromocyclic AMP also resulted in an increased rate of 45Ca2+ entry via nitrendipine-sensitive Ca2+ channel. In contrast, long term treatment of myotubes in culture with isoproterenol and other compounds that increased intracellular cyclic AMP led to a large increase in the number of nitrendipine receptors. This increase was accompanied by a 4-10-fold decrease in the affinity of the receptors for nitrendipine. Alprenolol inhibited the long term effects of isoproterenol. In vivo treatment of 7-day-old chicks with reserpine and alprenolol produced a decrease in the number of skeletal muscle nitrendipine receptors. This decrease in receptor number was accompanied by an increase in the affinity of nitrendipine for its receptor by a factor of 4 to 5. These effects on the nitrendipine receptor were prevented by simultaneous injection of isoproterenol. The results are discussed in relation to the role of beta-adrenergic receptors and intracellular cyclic AMP in the regulation of skeletal muscle Ca2+ channels.", 
    "21": "The original Norwegian Multicenter Study on Timolol after Myocardial Infarction was a double-blind, randomized study comparing the effect of timolol with that of placebo for up to 33 months after acute myocardial infarction. The initial results showed that the cumulated mortality rate was 39.4 per cent lower among 945 patients randomly assigned to timolol treatment than among 939 patients randomly assigned to placebo (P = 0.0003). After the end of the double-blind period the majority of participating patients in the timolol group continued to receive beta-adrenergic blockade, whereas the majority of placebo-treated patients continued without such blockade. During an extended follow-up of participating patients up to 72 months after randomization, the mortality curves of the two groups continued to rise in parallel. Cumulated mortality rates were 32.3 per cent in the placebo group and 26.4 per cent in the timolol group (P = 0.0028). We conclude that the previously observed early beneficial effect of beta-adrenergic blocking therapy is maintained for at least six years after infarction.", 
    "22": "Stressful surgical stimuli, such as endotracheal intubation, surgical incision, organ manipulation and emergence from anesthesia, elicit adrenergic responses that precipitate transient but intense increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Although this response is well tolerated in healthy patients, patients with ischemic heart disease are at significant risk of myocardial ischemia and infarction owing to the sudden increase in myocardial oxygen demand. Parenteral beta blockers are effective in blunting this adrenergic response, but the duration of action of these agents is long-lasting and the degree of beta blockade is often difficult to predict. Further, long-acting parenteral beta blockers may cause adverse effects, the reversal of which presents a difficult clinical problem in patients with ischemic heart disease. The availability of esmolol, an ultrashort-acting parenteral beta-adrenergic antagonist with a half-life of 9 minutes, brings obvious advantages to the perioperative management of hypertension and tachycardia. With esmolol treatment, the difficulties of therapy with long-lasting beta blockers are avoided. Also, to blunt the adrenergic response, the anesthesiologist will have an alternative to increasing the depth of anesthesia, which can accentuate cardiovascular depression and prolong awakening and postoperative respiratory depression. Clinical studies performed during the perioperative period reveal that esmolol is safe and effective in this setting. Esmolol has been shown to be safe and efficacious in patients in ASA classifications I through IV and patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass surgery. The pharmacokinetic profile, rapid onset and elimination half-life make this agent particularly well suited to treat the very intense but transient adrenergic responses to surgical stress in patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac surgery.", 
    "23": "Systolic hypertension, which is common soon after cardiac surgery, increases cardiac work and may threaten fresh vascular anastomoses. Because postoperative hypertension is often associated with elevated catecholamines and preoperative use of beta-blocking agents, esmolol, an ultrashort-acting beta-blocking agent, was compared with nitroprusside in a crossover study in this setting. Twelve patients, 18 to 28 hours after cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass graft in 9, aortic valve replacement in 2 and valved aortic conduit with reimplantation of coronary arteries in 1 patient) received controlled infusions of esmolol (mean dosage 142 +/- 100 micrograms/kg/min, range 50 to 300 micrograms/kg/min) and nitroprusside (mean dose 1.6 +/- 1.3 micrograms/kg/min, range 0.5 to 2.75 micrograms/kg/min). In this open-label study, choice of the first drug was randomized, after which patients were then crossed over to the other study drug. Therapeutic response (greater than or equal to 15% systolic blood pressure reduction) was achieved in 11 of 12 esmolol patients and 12 of 12 nitroprusside patients. Both drugs significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as left ventricular stroke work index. While the cardiac index was decreased by esmolol and increased by nitroprusside, neither drug significantly changed stroke volume index. Systemic vascular resistance, unchanged by esmolol, was decreased significantly by nitroprusside. Oxygen saturation and Pao2, unchanged with esmolol, were both significantly reduced with nitroprusside. Thus, for hypertension early after cardiac surgery, esmolol is safe, effective and rapid and, compared with nitroprusside, results in less unwanted decrease in diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation, but there is more decrease in heart rate and cardiac index.", 
    "24": "Beta blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand and are therefore useful in ischemic states. They reduce angina pectoris and reduce the risk of death when administered long-term after acute myocardial infarction. Some studies suggest that when administered early after coronary occlusion they can reduce myocardial infarct size. Relative contraindications to beta blockers, such as a history of congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive lung disease, atrioventricular conduction defects and low blood pressure, limit their use. Conventional beta blockers have a relatively long duration of action and are either contraindicated or must be used with particular caution in patients with these contraindications. Esmolol is an ultrashort-acting beta blocker with a biologic half-life of 9 minutes. Therefore, such an agent may be useful in patients with ischemic heart disease in whom reducing heart rate would be beneficial but in whom there is concern that beta blockers might not be tolerated. Esmolol reduced myocardial infarct size in 2 experimental studies of coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion, and improved the recovery of the stunned myocardium when administered during experimental myocardial ischemia. Esmolol's brief duration of action may make it safer than conventional beta blockers for the management of patients with unstable angina or myocardial infarction.", 
    "25": "This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel study compared the effectiveness and tolerance of intravenous esmolol with intravenous propranolol in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (heart rate [HR] greater than 120 beats/min). Efficacy was evaluated in 53 patients receiving esmolol and in 57 patients receiving propranolol. Patients randomized to esmolol received infusions of various doses of esmolol ranging from 50 to 300 micrograms/kg/min (each dose infused for 5 minutes) over a 30-minute titration period with intermittent placebo boluses of propranolol. Those randomized for propranolol received 1 mg/min for the first 3 minutes, and then another 3 mg from minutes 5 to 8 with continuous placebo esmolol infusion during the 30-minute titration period. A therapeutic response, defined by 20% or greater reduction in HR, HR less than 100 beats/min or conversion to normal sinus rhythm, was achieved in 72% of patients on esmolol compared with 69% of patients on propranolol (difference not significant). The therapeutic response was maintained in 67% of patients on esmolol and 58% of patients on propranolol (difference not significant) during a 4-hour maintenance period. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm occurred in 14% of esmolol patients and 16% of propranolol patients during titration and 10% of esmolol and 8% of propranolol patients during maintenance. After discontinuation of study drugs, a more rapid reversal of the reduction in HR was observed in esmolol patients compared with those patients receiving propranolol. Adverse reactions were seen in 29 (45%) patients on esmolol and 11 (18%) patients on propranolol. The principle adverse reaction was hypotension, which was predominantly asymptomatic and found in 23 patients receiving esmolol and 4 receiving propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Preclinical studies show that esmolol is an ultrashortacting, cardioselective beta blocker that possesses minimal partial agonist action or membrane-depressant properties. The electrophysiologic and hemodynamic actions of esmolol are the result of beta blockade. No direct, beta receptor-independent cardiovascular actions have been identified with beta-blocking doses in laboratory experiments. Because esmolol slows atrioventricular conduction, increases atrioventricular refractoriness and decreases the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand, it should have use in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias and acute myocardial ischemia. Esmolol, because of its ultrashort duration of action, should be safe for the induction of beta blockade in patients who are critically ill and is ideally suited for rapidly changing levels of beta blockade in this clinical situation.", 
    "27": "In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study, the effects of esmolol and propranolol were examined at rest and during peak upright exercise in 15 patients. At rest, both esmolol and propranolol significantly decreased heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac index and right ventricular ejection fraction. During exercise, significant decreases were also found in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and cardiac index in both treatment groups. No significant differences were found between mean esmolol and mean propranolol measurements at rest and during exercise, except for the exercise systolic blood pressure, which was lower during esmolol infusion. Blood levels of esmolol decreased markedly by 30 minutes postinfusion, as did its beta-blocking action. Esmolol was well tolerated with no important local, systemic or laboratory abnormalities. Thus, the effects of esmolol on cardiovascular performance at rest and during exercise are similar to those of propranolol.", 
    "28": "The electrophysiologic characteristics of esmolol were studied in 14 patients. Ten men and 4 women, mean age 57 years, were electrophysiologically evaluated at baseline, and also at 4 to 8 minutes after the administration of a maintenance infusion of esmolol. Plasma samples for esmolol blood levels were drawn at 10 minutes of the maintenance infusion, at the end of the maintenance infusion and 30 minutes after the maintenance infusion was discontinued. Results of this study showed that esmolol has typical beta-blocker electrophysiologic effects. Its major action was on sinus node function; it prolonged this basic sinus cycle length but had no significant effect on intrinsic automaticity as reflected by the corrected sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction. Direct effects on atrioventricular (AV) nodal function were reflected by effects on AV nodal conduction and refractoriness. There was no direct effect on atrial function and, as expected, no effect on His-Purkinje or ventricular function. The intensity of esmolol's electrophysiologic effects on sinus node function, AV nodal conduction and AH interval is comparable to those of other beta blockers.", 
    "29": "The clinical pharmacology and pharmacodynamic data from several clinical trials are summarized. The pharmacokinetic profile of esmolol alone and in the presence of digoxin, morphine and warfarin was studied. Conversely the effect of esmolol on these drugs was monitored. No clinically important effects were observed on vital signs, blood chemistry or hematology. The pharmacokinetic interactions associated with administration of these drug combinations were statistically significant in several cases, but they were not considered to be of clinical importance.", 
    "30": "Mice trained to discriminate 1 mg/kg d-amphetamine from saline, or the selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor, nisoxetine, from saline, cross-generalized to the alternate drug. They also generalized to 5.6 mg/kg cocaine. The cues produced by amphetamine were antagonized by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, and slightly potentiated by the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine. The nisoxetine cue was also antagonized by prazosin. In contrast, the peripherally acting sympathomimetics, p-hydroxyamphetamine and phenylpropranolamine, failed to substitute for, and pimozide and propranolol failed to block, either drug cue. In addition, prazosin, at a dose that did not affect either saline-associated locomotor behavior in mice or the locomotor-activity increase produced by the dopamine uptake inhibitor, bupropion, also antagonized the locomotor stimulation produced by amphetamine and cocaine. Thus, in mice, both the cues and locomotor stimulation produced by amphetamine and cocaine appear to be at least partially mediated by central alpha 1-adrenoceptor activation secondary to increased central synaptic concentrations of norepinephrine.", 
    "31": "Agents that react chemically with sulfhydryl groups of proteins modify the response of adenylate cyclase to stimulation by beta-adrenergic agonists. N-Ethylmaleimide, an agent that alkylates sulfhydryl groups, inactivates both the catalytic moiety of adenylate cyclase and the stimulatory, regulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein Ns of rat fat cells but fails to affect binding of antagonists to the beta-adrenergic receptor [Malbon, C. C., Graziano, M. P., & Johnson, G. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 3254-3260]. Treating membranes of rat fat cells with dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol, agents that reduce disulfide bridges of proteins, results in a loss of binding of beta-adrenergic radioligands to the receptor. The specific binding of radioligands to beta-adrenergic receptors that are solubilized in digitonin is affected similarly by treatment with disulfide bridge reducing agents. beta-Adrenergic receptor purified from rat fat cells and treated with beta-mercaptoethanol (10%) and then subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate migrates as a Mr 67 000 peptide [Cubero, A., & Malbon, C. C. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 1344-1350]. In the absence of disulfide bridge reducing agents, however, the purified receptor exhibits greater electrophoretic mobility, migrating as a peptide with Mr 54 000. Treating the native form of the purified receptor with beta-mercaptoethanol (0.1-10%) or dithiothreitol (0.1-10 mM) decreases the ability of the receptor to bind beta-adrenergic ligands, decreases the electrophoretic mobility of the receptor, and results in receptor peptides migrating with molecular weight ranging from 54 000 to 67 000 when subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The effects of apomorphine on the volume of gastric secretion and its content of H+, K+, Na+ and Cl- were determined in conscious rats having gastric cannulas. Apomorphine dose-dependently (0.25-0.5 mg/kg s.c.) decreased the volume of gastric secretion, its acid concentration and, at the highest dose, Cl- concentration. However, Na+ and K+ concentrations were unchanged. The alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (0.25-0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and yohimbine (5-10 mg/kg i.p.), the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg i.p.), the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (1 mg/kg i.p.) and the dopamine receptor antagonists haloperidol (0.25-2.5 mg/kg i.p.), metoclopramide (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) or domperidone (2.5 mg/kg i.p.), administered alone, had little or no effect on the volume, H+, Na+ or Cl- concentrations of gastric secretion. Propranolol prevented the action of apomorphine to reduce the volume of gastric secretion but failed to modify the reductions in H+ and Cl- concentrations. The action of propranolol was mimicked by ICI 118551 but not by the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol. Yohimbine, prazosin or domperidone had little or no effect on the actions of apomorphine. Haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and metoclopramide (10 mg/kg i.p.) antagonised apomorphine's action to reduce H+ and Cl- concentrations but significantly enhanced the action of apomorphine to reduce the volume of gastric secretion. The results suggest that the ability of apomorphine to reduce the volume of gastric secretion is mediated via beta 2-adrenoceptors whilst acid concentration is reduced via an action on neuroleptic sensitive receptors.", 
    "33": "The effect of dopamine upon the oxygen consumption (QO2) of brown fat adipocytes was measured by polarography. The results showed a marked stimulation of QO2 by dopamine, similar to that induced by noradrenaline. The dopamine response could be blocked by haloperidol, butaclamol, propranolol and by high concentrations of tolazoline. These results suggest a role for dopamine in energy release from brown fat.", 
    "34": "Stress-induced renin and prolactin secretion was investigated using a conditioned emotional response paradigm. Three minutes after placement in a chamber the rats received an electric shock to their feet via the grid floor, then were immediately returned to their home cage. This procedure was repeated for 3 consecutive days. On the fourth day, instead of receiving an electric shock, they were removed after 3 min and sacrificed by decapitation. Control rats were treated identically with the exception that shock was not administered at any time. There was a significant increase in plasma renin activity and prolactin level in the stressed rats. The administration of the antianxiety drugs chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.) or midazolam (0.125-2 mg/kg i.p.) blocked the stress-induced increase in prolactin levels but not the stress-induced rise in plasma renin activity. Administration of the beta-blocker propranolol (1 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited, but did not completely block, stress-induced rise in plasma-renin activity and had no effect on stress-induced prolactin secretion. The opiate antagonist naloxone (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.) and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor diisopropyl fluorophosphate (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) did not block stress-induced renin or prolactin secretion. It is concluded that stress-induced prolactin secretion is regulated by a benzodiazepine-mediated mechanism and that stress-induced renin but not prolactin secretion is mediated in part via beta-receptors.", 
    "35": "Bleeding from esophageal varices is a feared complication of liver cirrhosis with high mortality. Pharmacotherapy of the acute bleeding episode with vasopressin has been shown to be effective in controlled studies, but side effects of this therapy are high and therefore replacement of vasopressin with somatostatin is under investigation. Another potential lead is the combination of vasopressin with vasodilators such as nitroglycerin. While acute pharmacotherapy of the patient with esophageal varices is well accepted, chronic or prophylactic pharmacotherapy is still in the investigative stage. Prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers, e.g. propranolol, has been shown to be effective in compensated patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In patients with more advanced stages of the disease, or with cirrhosis of other etiology, the effectiveness of propranolol has not been proven. The mechanism of propranolol is similar to that of vasopressin, i.e. it lowers portal pressure by reducing portal flow. To maintain function of the affected organ, an alternative approach--namely lowering of portal pressure through reduction of the pathologically elevated resistance--should be actively investigated.", 
    "36": "The role of serotonin axons in modulating the norepinephrine neurotransmission system in rat brain was investigated. Selective lesions of the forebrain serotonergic system were made by injecting 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the midbrain raphe nuclei. Four to six weeks after the lesion, the uptake of 3H-labeled serotonin in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus was reduced by more than 90 percent, while neither the uptake of 3H-labeled norepinephrine nor the content of norepinephrine was affected in either tissue. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors, as measured by radioligand binding with 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol, was increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats with lesions. Similarly, specific lesions of central serotonin axons produced by systemically administered p-chloramphetamine resulted in an increase in the binding of 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol to beta-adrenergic receptors and in the production of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in response to isoproterenol. These results indicate that serotonin axons may regulate beta-adrenergic receptor number and function in brain.", 
    "37": "A 65-year-old man developed unilateral nonrubeotic secondary angle-closure glaucoma after central retinal vein occlusion. Therapy was nonsurgical and included medical control of the intraocular pressure. The anterior chamber eventually deepened and panretinal photocoagulation was later necessary because of developing rubeosis iridis and neovascularization of the optic disk. Secondary nonrubeotic angle-closure glaucoma from central retinal vein occlusion must be distinguished from rubeotic glaucoma or pupillary-block glaucoma so that inappropriate medical or surgical treatment can be avoided.", 
    "38": "By means of Ca2+- and K+-selective microelectrodes, the changes in intracellular free Ca2+ and K+ were measured during the hyperpolarizing responses induced by ATP, complement and beta-lipoprotein in mouse fibroblastic L cells. The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration [( Ca]i) was about 0.4 microM in the resting state. The hyperpolarizing responses always coincided with a phasic increase in [Ca]i. ATP or beta-lipoprotein induced about a 2-fold rise in [Ca]i, and complement did up to 3-fold. Both the hyperpolarizing responses and [Ca]i increases were prevented by removal of external Ca2+ or by application of a Ca-channel blocker, nifedipine. Quinine, a Ca-activated K-channel inhibitor, suppressed the hyperpolarizing responses but not the [Ca]i increases. During the hyperpolarizing response, the intracellular free K+ concentration gradually decreased from about 120 to 110 mM. Thus, it is concluded that ATP, complement and beta-lipoprotein caused a transient elevation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ due to Ca2+ influxes, thereby inducing electrical membrane responses through activation of Ca-dependent K-channels in the fibroblasts.", 
    "39": "The Langendorff isolated rat heart was adapted to the study of minute-to-minute percentage changes in bulk protein degradation by using non-recirculating perfusion. Hearts were perfused at 8 ml/min at 35 degrees C with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 11 mM-glucose, and only hearts with regular ventricular rhythm were employed. Proteins were labelled by infusion of [3H]leucine for 0.5 h in vitro. A complete amino acid mixture was then added at 3 times normal rat extracellular concentrations. After labelling, the re-incorporation of [3H]leucine was competitively inhibited by addition of either 4 mM-leucine or 20 microM-cycloheximide. The residual unincorporated radioactivity and the preferentially labelled rapid-turnover proteins were eliminated during a 3 h preliminary perfusion period. The basal rate of release of [3H]leucine and percentage changes were then determined at 1 min intervals, by using each heart as its own control. Leucine metabolism was inconsequential to results. Exchange of intracellular leucine pools with extracellular leucine and subsequent release in effluent perfusate was 95% complete within approx. 2 min. The basal rate of protein degradation was unchanged by electrical stimulation of the heart rate to 360 beats/min or cessation of contractile activity by membrane depolarization under 25 mM-KCl. Infusion of the beta-agonist isoprenaline at 5-500 nM caused a graded inhibition of myocardial protein degradation within 5-6 min, with a maximum inhibition of 30%. This inhibition was sustained for at least 1 h of drug administration and was reversed within 4-6 min of cessation of isoprenaline or simultaneous infusion of 1 microM of the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol. Minute-to-minute adrenergic proteolytic control was a simultaneous co-variable with beta-receptor-mediated inotropic changes in right-intraventricular systolic pressure. Stoppage of the heart in asystole by the Ca2+-channel blocker nifedipine (0.7 microM) delayed the onset, but did not cause sustained reversal, of adrenergic-inhibited degradation, indicating the absence of a direct obligatory mechanistic linkage between the events of the contraction-relaxation cycle and protein degradation in this preparation.", 
    "40": "We reported previously that metyrapone inhibited the maturational effect of adrenocorticotropin in the fetal sheep lung, even in the presence of exogenous glucocorticoids. To examine the role of beta-adrenergic input in this response we examined lung maturation in fetal sheep treated for 100 hours in vivo with adrenocorticotropin (66 ng/min for 15 minutes every 2 hours, n = 5); adrenocorticotropin plus propranolol (40 micrograms/min, n = 4), or saline solution (n = 8). Pulmonary maturation was assessed by pressure-volume curves, phospholipid content, and morphologic features. The basal cortisol level rose from less than 5 to 32.0 +/- 12.1 and 83.5 +/- 8.0 ng/ml in the adrenocorticotropin and adrenocorticotropin plus propranolol groups, respectively. The adrenal:body weight ratio (X 10(-4)) rose from 1.43 +/- 0.12 in the saline solution group to 2.90 +/- 0.16 and 2.51 +/- 0.14 in the adrenocorticotropin and adrenocorticotropin plus propranolol groups, respectively. Lung distensibility (milliliters of air per gram of lung) rose from 1.10 +/- 0.14 to 1.90 +/- 0.20 in the adrenocorticotropin group but was unchanged (0.98 +/- 0.24) in the adrenocorticotropin plus propranolol group. Phosphatidylcholine (milligrams per gram of lung) in the lung lavage rose from 0.07 +/- 0.02 to 0.23 +/- 0.11 in the adrenocorticotropin group but was not significantly changed (0.12 +/- 0.06) in the adrenocorticotropin plus propranolol group. We conclude that propranolol inhibits the maturational effects of adrenocorticotropin on the fetal lung, which implies that the mechanism of pulmonary maturation is not solely dependent on endogenous cortisol and must be mediated, at least in part, through adrenergic responses.", 
    "41": "The ligand-induced internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors and the receptor-mediated internalization of epidermal growth factor were blocked, under similar conditions, by phenylarsine oxide (PAO) in human astrocytoma cells (1321N1). The inhibition was not prevented or reversed by monofunctional sulfhydryl agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol or glutathione; however, the inhibitory action of PAO was blocked and reversed by bifunctional thiols such as 2,3-dimercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol. The results are consistent with the interaction of PAO with vicinal sulfhydryl groups to form a stabile ring structure. PAO did not prevent isoproterenol-induced uncoupling (desensitization) of beta-adrenergic receptors even though receptor internalization was completely blocked. The effects of PAO on receptor internalization could not be explained by any action of the trivalent arsenical to lower ATP levels. Ligand binding to both receptors was not detectably altered by PAO under conditions selective for inhibition for endocytosis. The results suggest a common mechanism for internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors and epidermal growth factor by a process that involves vicinal sulfhydryl groups.", 
    "42": "This work was designed to investigate the influence of rat platelet adrenoceptors on the early thrombin-induced serotonin release. In washed platelets prelabeled with [3H]-serotonin, adrenaline and isoproterenol both inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the early thrombin-induced secretion of serotonin. Inhibitory responses of both adrenaline and isoproterenol were blocked in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, suggesting that the catecholamine acted solely through beta-adrenoceptors. However, isoproterenol inhibited the thrombin-induced serotonin release to a much greater extent than the catecholamine, suggesting that the alpha 2-component of adrenaline might account for the difference observed between the two compounds. Our observation that selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists as yohimbine and rauwolscine potentiated the inhibitory effect of adrenaline to a level close to that observed with isoproterenol, lends support to the above hypothesis. This latter result suggested that, conversely, alpha 2-adrenergic compounds might exert a counteracting effect on a full beta-adrenoceptor mediated inhibition. Although synthetic alpha 2-adrenergic agents failed to influence isoproterenol inhibitory effect, our study shows that prestimulation of beta-adrenoceptors by isoproterenol, followed by addition of adrenaline or noradrenaline markedly diminished the inhibitory effect of isoproterenol to a level close to that which characterized the inhibition observed with catecholamines, when tested alone. Our work favours the hypothesis that, in rat platelets, early after platelet stimulation, catecholamines might counteract a beta-adrenoceptor- mediated inhibition, through alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites.", 
    "43": "The problem of a sotalol-induced ventricular arrhythmia (torsade de pointes) is presented and the contributory role of hypokalaemia is emphasized. It is concluded that sotalol may not be a suitable beta-blocker to use with a diuretic.", 
    "44": "The role of serotonin in the pathogenesis of hypertension is interesting, and its investigation is much in vogue at present. This study compared the hypotensive effect of ketanserin, a specific 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, with metoprolol in essential hypertension. On a double-blind basis, one treatment group (19 patients on ketanserin) was compared with another (21 patients on metoprolol). There was a significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure with both ketanserin and metoprolol (P less than 0,001). Side-effects were insignificant. One patient on metoprolol and 2 on ketanserin complained of dizziness. The dose of ketanserin was 40 mg twice a day and that of metoprolol 100 mg twice a day. Ketanserin does not appear to cause abnormal haematological values or biochemical adverse effects. It can be given to hypertensive patients with cardiac failure or bronchial asthma without adverse effects and may improve the peripheral vascular status of a hypertensive patient.", 
    "45": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for the determination of propranolol, its neutral and basic metabolites from a single plasma sample. These analytes were extracted simply and efficiently by a solid-phase extraction column based on C18 modified silica (C18 Bond-Elut). Propranolol, the 4-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl metabolites were separated on a mu Bondapak C18 column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile--0.1% phosphoric acid. Propranolol glycol was selectively eluted from the C18 Bond-Elut column with acetonitrile and chromatographed separately with a mobile phase of acetonitrile--water. The recoveries of propranolol and all metabolites were greater than 78% with an intra-assay coefficient of variation between 4.9 and 7.3% at a concentration of 5-50 ng/ml. The minimum detectable levels in 1 ml of plasma were 1.0 ng/ml propranolol, 6.0 ng/ml 4-hydroxypropranolol, 1.0 ng/ml N-desisopropylpropranolol and 2.5 ng/ml propranolol glycol. Enzyme hydrolysis, Bond-Elut extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that propranolol, the neutral and basic metabolites were extensively conjugated in dog plasma (propranolol 67%, 4-hydroxypropranolol 98%, N-desisopropylpropranolol 55% and propranolol glycol 80%). With the use of pure enzymes and a selective inhibitor the nature of this conjugation appeared to involve both glucuronidation and sulfation. The conjugation of propranolol involved mainly glucuronidation (58-62%) compared to sulfation (7-12%), whilst that of 4-hydroxypropranolol mainly involved sulfation (55-65%) compared to glucuronidation (32-38%). The values for N-desisopropylpropranolol and propranolol glycol were 26-31% and 12% sulfation, 16-29% and 68-85% glucuronidation, respectively.", 
    "46": "During development, the chronotropic response of rat ventricular myocardium to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation changes from positive to negative. The alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine increases the rate of contraction of neonatal rat myocytes cultured alone but decreases the rate of contraction when the myocytes are cultured with functional sympathetic neurons. The developmental induction of the inhibitory myocardial response to alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in intact ventricle and in cultured myocytes was shown to coincide with the functional acquisition of a substrate for pertussis toxin. A 41-kilodalton protein from myocytes cultured with sympathetic neurons and from adult rat myocardium showed, respectively, 2.2- and 16-fold increases in pertussis toxin-associated ADP-ribosylation (ADP, adenosine diphosphate) as compared to controls. In nerve-muscle cultures, inhibition of the actions of this protein by pertussis toxin-specific ADP-ribosylation reversed the mature inhibitory alpha 1-adrenergic response to an immature stimulatory pattern. The results suggest that innervation is associated with the appearance of a functional pertussis toxin substrate by which the alpha 1-adrenergic response becomes linked to a decrease in automaticity.", 
    "47": "Results are presented from a study conducted in twelve male patients with hypertension who were treated during alternating one-month periods with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or a combination of both drugs. After one month of placebo therapy, the patients received 10 mg of nifedipine three times daily, 100 mg of metoprolol twice daily plus 10 mg of nifedipine three times daily, or 100 mg of metoprolol twice daily during successive periods. Nifedipine monotherapy resulted in a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest and in systolic blood pressure during exercise. Monotherapy with metoprolol also significantly reduced systolic blood pressure during exercise. Combination therapy with the calcium channel blocker and the beta blocker produced a significantly greater decrease in both resting and exercise blood pressures than with either drug alone, with achievement of adequate blood pressure control in all patients.", 
    "48": "Pyramidal (CA1) cells in rat hippocampal slices were voltage clamped using a single electrode voltage clamp. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), depolarizing pulses from holding potentials of -60 to -70 mV elicited a slow inward calcium (Ca2+) current and two outward potassium (K+) currents: an A current and a slower, Ca2+-dependent K+ current. Noradrenaline (NA) (20 microM) depressed the amplitude of the K+ currents without affecting the Ca2+ current. The effect of NA could be blocked with propranolol and was mimicked by isoprenaline, suggesting that NA depresses the K+ currents by binding to beta-receptors.", 
    "49": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of atenolol as compared with placebo in the treatment of patients hospitalized with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition to receiving customary therapy, 61 patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol, and 59 to receive placebo. Outcome was assessed daily by the measurement of nine features in three categories: vital signs, clinical signs (e.g., tremor), and behavioral signs (e.g., agitation and anxiety). Compared with placebo patients, atenolol patients had a significant reduction in the mean length of hospital stay (four as compared with five days, P less than 0.02). On each treatment day, significantly fewer patients receiving atenolol required concomitant benzodiazepines, and patients receiving placebo required a significantly higher mean daily dose of benzodiazepines. Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at base line, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol, and their abnormal behavior and clinical characteristics also resolved more rapidly. We conclude that atenolol is helpful in the treatment of patients with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "50": "The cardiovascular effects of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists salbutamol and terbutaline have been evaluated in anaesthetised, areflexic dogs. The preparation was designed to reduce the effects of changes in cardiac function mediated via reflex responses to changes in blood pressure. The effects of the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists on heart rate, hindlimb blood flow, left ventricular pressure, max dP/dt and (dP/dt)/IIT (integrated isometric tension) were compared to those of isoprenaline, while blood pressure was held constant. All three drugs produced dose-dependent increases in heart rate, myocardial contractility and iliac blood flow. When equiactive inotropic doses of isoprenaline and salbutamol were compared, salbutamol produced a significantly lower chronotropic effect. A similar inotropic selectivity was found when terbutaline was compared to isoprenaline. beta 2-Adrenoceptor blockade abolished this selectivity. It is concluded that, in the absence of autonomic reflex activity, the beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonists are relatively selective inotropic stimulants.", 
    "51": "Spermidine, spermine, and putreanine, a metabolite of spermidine, caused transient relaxation of the isolated guinea-pig trachealis. The spermidine effect was not blocked by ouabain, propranolol or indomethacin. Spermidine treatment was shown to desensitize the tissue to subsequent additions of spermidine. After exposure to spermidine and repeated washes with spermidine-free solution, trachealis responded to KCl (30 mM) with a paradoxical relaxation. This relaxation was not blocked by propranolol, ouabain or indomethacin.", 
    "52": "The effects of verapamil and propranolol on the LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction were studied in the isolated, perfused and ventilated guinea pig lungs. Verapamil (4.10(-5) et 1, 2.10(-4)M.1(-1], a calcium antagonist, produces a significative inhibition of LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction. On the other hand, propranolol (10(-7)M and 10(-4)M) does not increase the constrictor effects of LTD4 in guinea-pig isolated lung. These first results obtained in guinea-pig lung, confirmed the protective effect of verapamil, effect previously demonstrated in vivo or in vitro by using lung parenchymal strips. We have also confirmed the difference between the in vivo and in vitro effects of propranolol.", 
    "53": "Our study is aimed to evaluate the change of QT/QS2 ratio in normal subjects during both isometric and dynamic exercise before and after propranolol administration. We studied 10 young volunteers healthy subjects who performed an isometric exercise by squeezing a grip dynamometer at 70% of their maximal voluntary contraction as long as possible. They also performed a dynamic exercise undergoing a submaximal bicycle stress test. Both tests were performed before and after administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/Kg e.v.) QT and QS2 intervals were measured at rest, during exercise and in the recovery period. Heart rate and blood pressure were also determined. Isometric exercise induces a significant shortening of both intervals although minor for QT so that the ratio significantly increases in comparison to baseline (p less than .001). At rest propranolol induces a significant decrease of heart rate and only a slight lengthening of QT and QS2 so that the ratio is unchanged. During exercise propranolol does not influence the increase of heart rate and blood pressure and the shortening of QT interval but prevent exercise-induced QS2 shortening so that the ratio after beta-blockade is significantly reduced at the peak of exercise (p less than .005). During dynamic exercise QT and QS2 behaviour is similar to that of isometric exercise; in fact both intervals are shortened and QS2 decrease is major than QT so that the ratio increases (p less than .001). These results confirm that QT/QS2 ratio can monitor the effects of adrenergic stimulation on the heart during physiological manoeuvres enhancing sympathetic discharge like occurs during both isometric and dynamic exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "The therapeutic efficacy of combined and separate application of a diuretic (brinaldix) and beta-adrenoblocker (visken) was compared in the treatment of 69 patients with essential hypertension running a stable course; the patients were kept on a low-sodium diet (4-6 g NaCl daily) and given a potassium substitute for NaCl.", 
    "55": "Electrophysiological studies using rats anesthetized with chloral hydrate were performed to determine whether or not noradrenaline originating in the locus coeruleus (LC) produces a beta-receptor-mediated inhibition of the nucleus accumbens (Acc) neurons receiving input from the hippocampus (HPC). When conditioning stimuli were applied to the LC preceding a test stimulus to the HPC, an inhibition of spike generation with HPC stimulation was observed during 20-100 msec of the conditioning-test time interval. This inhibition was observed when the stimulating electrode was located in the LC or its immediate vicinity. The spike generation upon HPC stimulation was also inhibited by iontophoretic application of noradrenaline, and the inhibition was antagonized by iontophoretically applied sotalol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, but not by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic blocker. These results suggest that noradrenaline derived from the LC produces a beta-receptor-mediated inhibition of the Acc neurons receiving input from the HPC.", 
    "56": "Effects of isosorbide 5-mononitrate (5-ISMN) on cardiovascular function were compared with those of verapamil hydrochloride and propranolol hydrochloride in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Intravenous injection of 5-ISMN (3 mg/kg) considerably lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP). Especially, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), cardiac work (CW) and systolic right ventricular pressure (SRVP) were significantly decreased. 5-ISMN also produced a continuous reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (MPCWP) and mean right atrium pressure (MRAP), while heart rate (HR) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were not altered significantly. Intravenous injection of verapamil (0.3 mg/kg) considerably lowered diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Verapamil also caused a significant decrease in HR, CW and TPR and a slight decrease in SRVP and MPCWP. However, SV was significantly increased, and slight increases in MPAP and MRAP were also observed. Propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) greatly decreased HR together with CO, CW, SRVP and MPAP and slightly decreased MPCWP, while it caused a considerable increase in 3V and a slight increase in TPR. The finding that administration of 5-ISMN resulted in reduction of pre-load and after-load suggests the possibility that this drug might decrease venous return and thereby reduce myocardial oxygen requirements.", 
    "57": "The effects of agonists and antagonists, specific for the different adrenoceptor subtypes on the automaticity of cultured ventricular cells from postnatal rat, were studied. Chronotropic responses were assessed by recording monophasic action potentials using intracellular microelectrodes. Contraction was assessed by an electro-optical procedure. (-)-Isoproterenol, salbutamol, (-)-phenylephrine, and methoxamine increased the spontaneous rate in a dose-dependent manner, but the stimulatory potencies of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were weaker than those of the beta-alternates. The frequency response to (-)-isoproterenol was inhibited by atenolol but not by butoxamine. Atenolol was also more effective than butoxamine in antagonizing the rate acceleration by salbutamol. The chronotropic effects of phenylephrine and methoxamine were inhibited by prazosin. In contrast, neither clonidine nor yohimbine displayed any chronotropic action. These findings suggest that the postjunctional adrenoceptors present in the sarcolemma of the isolated cardiac muscle cells, which mediate automaticity responses to catecholamines, are of beta 1, beta 2, and alpha 1 types, the physiological contribution of the beta 1-adrenoceptors being predominant. Applicability of these conclusions to the in situ myocardiocytes is discussed with respect to the level of functional differentiation achieved by the rat myocardial cells in culture.", 
    "58": "The plasma concentration-response relationships of oral and intravenous pindolol and propranolol have been studied in a group of eight healthy male subjects who received each dosage form in a randomized single-blind cross-over manner. Despite similar elimination half-lives, the duration of action of pindolol was longer than that of propranolol. This longer duration of action was associated with a flatter concentration-response curve for pindolol and may be related to the partial agonist activity of pindolol. Propranolol concentration-response curves were dependent on the route of drug administration whereas pindolol curves were similar following oral and intravenous routes of administration.", 
    "59": "We have compared the beta-adrenoceptor blocking and antihypertensive effects of chronic once daily treatment with conventional metoprolol 200 mg, two 'long-acting' formulations of metoprolol 200 mg and atenolol 100 mg in a cross-over study in 12 hypertensive patients concurrently receiving diuretic therapy. The peak effects of all compounds were similar, with significant reductions in exercise heart rate and blood pressure. Twenty-four hours after dosing only atenolol treatment was consistently associated with a reduction in both exercise heart rate (P less than 0.001) and blood pressure (P less than 0.02) when compared with placebo. Once daily treatment of hypertension with metoprolol, even in 'long-acting' formulations, cannot be recommended because of waning antihypertensive effect which would be missed at routine clinic attendance. Metoprolol should be prescribed twice daily in hypertension. So-called long-acting formulations do not always confer benefits over conventional dose forms.", 
    "60": "The porphyrin precursor, delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) at concentrations of 0.23-7.6 mM caused dose-dependent inhibition of spontaneous contractions in isolated preparations of rabbit small intestine, suspended in Ringer-Locke solution. Contractions which returned after inhibition from 3.8 and 7.6mM ALA showed increased amplitude and from 7.6 mM ALA a reduction in rate. Pretreatment with prazosin (10(-7) M) significantly reduced the duration of inhibition exerted by 3.8 and 7.6 mM ALA and also the amplitude of contractions returning after this inhibition. Pretreatment with yohimbine (10(-6) M) and propranolol (7 X 10(-6) M) had no significant effects. Blocking of the release of noradrenaline in preparations by incubation with 6-hydroxydopamine (10(-3) M) or guanethidine (1.5 X 10(-5) M) did not prevent the inhibitory effects of ALA. The alpha 1 agonist, cirazoline (10(-5) M), inhibited contractile activity. This effect was blocked by prazosin (10(-7) M). The alpha 2 agonist, guanoxabenz (10(-5) M) had no detectable effect, in the presence of prazosin, to block any residual alpha 1 actions. It is concluded that alpha 1 receptors mediate inhibitory effects in this preparation and that ALA appears to have direct effects upon these receptors.", 
    "61": "Ventricular fibrillation was induced by myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion in the isolated perfused rat heart. The dose-response effectiveness for the prototype antiarrhythmic drugs, propranolol, quinidine and lidocaine in converting the induced ventricular fibrillation to sinus rhythm was determined. The test is easy to perform and does not require skillful surgical procedure and long time for observation. In addition, no arrhythmogenic drugs are used and the amount of substance needed for the test is very small. It is suggested that this simple test be used as a cardiac antiarrhythmic screening test for antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "62": "The effects of infusions of angiotensin and vasopressin, in stepwise concentrations, on the cardiac baroreflex and on cardiac output were studied in seven adult unanaesthetized sheep and compared with those obtained with infusions of phenylephrine. Six animals were treated with the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, propranolol (in order to inhibit the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart). One animal was not treated with propranolol. In those animals in which arterial pressure increased during infusion of vasopressin, the slope of the systolic pressure-pulse interval relation was greater than that seen when phenylephrine was used to increase arterial pressure. Compared with the cardiac response to pressor doses of phenylephrine, infusions of angiotensin were associated with a lesser degree of cardiac slowing and a lesser reduction in cardiac output. The effects of combined infusions of angiotensin and vasopressin on the cardiac baroreflex were studied. In five sheep which were infused with a pressor dose of angiotensin (1.1 microgram/min), the stimulatory effect of vasopressin (1.0 u./min) on pulse interval and its depressant effect on cardiac output were attenuated. In seven sheep infused with 0.5 u./min of vasopressin, I.V. infusion of angiotensin (0.2-5.0 micrograms), produced a progressive decrease in pulse interval and increase in cardiac output as the dose was increased. Therefore, angiotensin can offset the cardioinhibitory effects of vasopressin. Since cardiac sympathetic activity was blocked and neither drug has any direct chronotropic effect on the heart, it would appear that these interactions between the two drugs affect the cardiac vagus either at a peripheral or central level.", 
    "63": "We performed a double-blind crossover study to compare the effects of long-term treatment of inhaled budesonide and terbutaline on bronchial hyperreactivity in 17 patients with allergic asthma. Both drugs were administered for 4 weeks with a placebo-treatment period before and after each active-treatment period. To assess bronchial hyperreactivity, standardized inhalation provocation tests with histamine and propranolol were performed every 2 weeks. Before each inhalation provocation the drugs were withheld for at least 12 hours. Before the budesonide treatment the FEV1 value (percent predicted) was 85.3 +/- 4.1% (mean +/- SEM). After 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with this drug, the value increased significantly to 89.4 +/- 4.1% and 96.2 +/- 3.8%, respectively (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.005). The histamine provocation concentrations causing a decrease in FEV1 of 20% (PC20) on the same days were 4.0, 7.2, and 9.5 mg/ml, respectively (both p less than 0.001). The PC20 values for propranolol, which were measured 1 hour after the histamine provocation, were 11.7, 13.3, and 14.0 mg/ml (ns). The FEV1 values before and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with terbutaline were 86.2 +/- 4.0%, 84.8 +/- 4.1%, and 87.0 +/- 4.6%, respectively. The histamine PC20 values on the same days were 4.7, 3.1 (p less than 0.05), and 3.8 mg/ml, respectively. The propranolol PC20 values were 14.2, 8.7, and 10.1 mg/ml (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05, respectively. We conclude that budesonide improves bronchial hyperreactivity, possibly by a dampening of late allergic reactions, whereas treatment with terbutaline may lead to a temporary increase of bronchial hyperreactivity, possibly as a result of beta-receptor desensitization.", 
    "64": "The possible role of catecholamines upon the nature of myocardial response to regional and global left ventricular ischaemia was investigated. Global ischaemia was accomplished by temporary occlusion of the left main coronary artery and regional ischaemia by temporary ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Isometric force of contraction was measured with strain gauge arches, regional blood flow by a thermistor technique and intracellular NADH redox level by a fluorometric technique. These measurements were made simultaneously in two areas on the left ventricular myocardium: one immediately below the bifurcation of the LAD and the other immediately below the circumflex coronary artery. Following LAD occlusion a variable inotropic response was observed in the ischaemic area. A decrease in contractile tension was found in 19 of the dogs (44%), no change in 23% and an increase was found in 33%. Global ischaemia invariably resulted in a decrease in contractile tension. NADH redox state was markedly higher during global than during regional ischaemia. Propranolol administration blocked the positive inotropic response to regional ischaemia. It is concluded that endogenous catecholamine release may be responsible for increased contractile force during regional ischaemia. This response is apparently limited by the oxygen availability to the tissue.", 
    "65": "Left ventricular function and exercise capacity were assessed in 79 patients randomised to receive intravenous and oral propranolol (n = 44) or conventional therapy (n = 35) within four hours of onset of their first myocardial infarction. Cineangiocardiography and exercise testing were performed four weeks after infarction to allow for maximum recovery of myocardial function. Left ventriculography showed no improvement in ejection fraction or preservation of regional contractile function in patients treated with propranolol compared with controls. A trend towards smaller end diastolic volumes was seen in the propranolol group (mean (SD) 151(42) ml) compared with controls (167(42) ml). Exercise duration and frequency of angina were not significantly different in the two groups. It is concluded that limitation of infarct size by propranolol does not lead to a significant improvement in ventricular systolic function, although left ventricular dilatation may be reduced. These findings are consistent with the known effect of early intravenous beta blockade which limits infarct size by preservation of subepicardial myocardium.", 
    "66": "We investigated the hypothesis that beat-to-beat variability in hemodynamic parameters reflects the dynamic interplay between ongoing perturbations to circulatory function and the compensatory response of short-term cardiovascular control systems. Spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure, and respiration were analyzed by spectral analysis in the 0.02- to 1-Hz frequency range. A simple closed-loop model of short-term cardiovascular control was proposed and evaluated in a series of experiments: pharmacological blockades of the parasympathetic, alpha-sympathetic, beta-sympathetic, and renin-angiotensin systems were used to open the principal control loops in order to examine changes in the spectral pattern of the fluctuations. Atrial pacing was used to examine blood pressure variability in the absence of HR variability. We found that respiratory frequency fluctuations in HR are parasympathetically mediated and that blood pressure fluctuations at this frequency result almost entirely from the direct effect of centrally mediated HR fluctuations. The sympathetic nervous system appears to be too sluggish to mediate respiratory frequency variations. Low-frequency (0.02-0.09 Hz) fluctuations in HR are jointly mediated by the parasympathetic and beta-sympathetic systems and appear to compensate for blood pressure fluctuations at this frequency. Low-frequency blood pressure fluctuations are probably due to variability in vasomotor activity which is normally damped by renin-angiotensin system activity. Blockade of the alpha-adrenergic system, however, does not significantly alter low-frequency blood pressure fluctuations.", 
    "67": "Acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine (AGEPC; 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine) was infused intravenously into rabbits (0.5 micrograms/kg); subsequently, temporal pulmonary alterations were assessed histologically. Within 30 seconds after AGEPC infusion, widespread platelet and neutrophil aggregates were distributed throughout the pulmonary microvasculature. Concomitantly, small muscular arteries and bronchioles throughout the lungs were contracted. Five minutes after AGEPC infusion, intravascular pulmonary platelet aggregates were less frequent and smaller than those observed at 30 seconds after infusion; however, AGEPC-induced pulmonary neutrophil sequestration persisted. Moreover, at this time, large mononucleated cells and damaged endothelial cells were prevalent throughout the pulmonary microvasculature. Sixty minutes after infusion, neither platelet aggregates nor arterial or bronchiolar constriction was observed. However, in most animals, neutrophils and large mononucleated cells were still abundant, and focal endothelial cell alterations persisted. In addition, discrete areas of interstitial hemorrhage around small and medium-sized arteries were present. These studies suggest that the intravascular release of AGEPC could initiate significant pulmonary injury and therefore could be an important etiologic factor in the development of inflammatory lung diseases.", 
    "68": "A high incidence of cardiac conduction disturbances is a salient feature in familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) and amyloid infiltration of the conduction system has been found. In patients with FAP autonomic nervous dysfunction involving gastrointestinal, urogenital and cardiovascular systems has been described. However, the present study is the first to evaluate the results of autonomic tests and pharmacologic intervention in the autonomic nervous regulation of the cardiac conduction system during an invasive electrophysiologic study. Seven patients with FAP and severe disturbances of the conduction system, evaluated concerning indications for pacemaker treatment, were studied; in 3 of them the parasympathetic regulation was found to be abolished. In 1 patient the observations indicated either vagal overactivity or denervation oversensitivity of the receptors. The function of the beta adrenoceptors was intact in all patients, but a disturbance of sympathetic innervation could not be excluded. Dysfunction of autonomic nervous regulation of the cardiac conduction system was thus found in 4 of 7 patients. However, most conduction abnormalities were irreversible, indicating amyloid infiltration of the conduction system as the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism, in accordance with the findings of pathoanatomic studies.", 
    "69": "Ventriculocisternal perfusion of propranolol (25 micrograms/kg/min for 30 min) throughout the entire brain ventricular system in anesthetized dogs decreased arterial pressure and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) norepinephrine. Localized perfusion of propranolol into the fourth ventricle produced increased CSF norepinephrine levels and a hypotensive response comparable to that seen with whole-brain ventriculocisternal perfusion. In comparison, perfusion of propranolol through the forebrain (lateral-third) ventricles resulted in changes in CSF norepinephrine comparable to those observed with the administration of the drug into the fourth ventricle but resulted in a reduced hypotensive response. Increased CSF norepinephrine levels and a hypotensive response were also observed after peripheral i.v. infusion of propranolol (100 micrograms/kg/min for 45 min). Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that an interaction of propranolol at noradrenergic nerve terminals in the hindbrain area results in a hypotensive effect which may contribute to the antihypertensive action of the drug.", 
    "70": "Social phobia is the least well studied phobic disorder of those included in DSM-III. Reports from the British literature indicate that the condition is a distinct one that usually begins in adolescence and affects males more often than females. Patients characteristically complain of somatic symptoms and a fear of humiliation when confronted with specific social stimuli. Ten social phobic patients were openly treated with the cardioselective, peripherally active beta-adrenergic blocking drug atenolol. Five patients had complete response and four had moderate response. Side effects were minimal. Atenolol appears to work in social phobic patients by reducing autonomic nervous system response to phobic stimuli.", 
    "71": "The effects of timolol, epinephrine, and acetazolamide on the rate of flow of aqueous humor through the anterior chamber of awake and sleeping human subjects was studied. Timolol reduced the rate in awake subjects but not sleeping subjects. Epinephrine increased the rate in sleeping subjects to a greater extent than in awake subjects. Acetazolamide reduced the rate of flow in awake subjects or epinephrine-stimulated subjects. Acetazolamide reduced the rate of flow slightly below the basal rate observed during sleep, but the reduction was small and not statistically significant. The authors propose that the diurnal fluctuation of the rate of aqueous humor flow in humans is driven by changes in the concentration of endogenous epinephrine available to the ciliary epithelia.", 
    "72": "To define the effects of beta-blockade therapy on PaO2, arterial blood gas levels were determined before and after therapeutic administration of propranolol in 44 acutely ill patients. With a FIo2 of 0.33 +/- 0.08, the PaO2 increased from 89.6 +/- 3.6 to 95.3 +/- 3.8 mmHg (p less than 0.01), 10 minutes after intravenous administration of 1 to 3 mg of propranolol. Simultaneous hemodynamic measurements obtained in six patients demonstrated a dramatic decrease in venous admixture, associated with decreases in cardiac output and mixed venous Po2. Propranolol administration generally results in a moderate increase in PaO2, which is related to a significant decrease in pulmonary shunt. The clinical implications of these findings are limited by the expected decrease in tissue oxygen delivery after beta-blockade therapy.", 
    "73": "The cardioequipotency of 400 mg bevantolol and 100 mg atenolol was determined by measuring the exercise heart rate in healthy subjects. The beta-blockers were then used in these doses to investigate their ventilatory effects in patients with asthma. The effects of both drugs on forced expiratory flow parameters for large and small airways were assessed at rest and during and after exercise. A dose-response curve was then plotted after inhalation of the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline. Bevantolol significantly decreased the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at rest, while there was no such change with placebo or atenolol. Both beta-blockers decreased the maximal expiratory flow rates at 50% of forced vital capacity (MEF50) and after expiration of 75% of the forced vital capacity (MEF25) at rest; the decrease was larger after bevantolol than after atenolol. During atenolol there was a decrease in FEV1 and in PEFR (P less than 0.01) 15 minutes after exercise in comparison with preexercise values. There was no significant difference between pre- and postexercise values of MEF50 and MEF25 during atenolol dosing. After bevantolol there was only a small change in PEFR after exercise, probably because of the low preexercise values of the ventilatory indices with this drug. Inhalation of terbutaline up to a dose of 2 mg significantly improved all ventilatory indices measured, but with bevantolol the values after 2 mg inhaled terbutaline were lower than the initial values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Clinical studies have shown that treatment with chronic timolol after a myocardial infarction decreases the incidence of reinfarction and mortality. It also limits the size of infarction when it is given IV during the acute phase of an infarction and followed by chronic oral dosing. It has been postulated that beta blockers work not only by a direct mechanism on the heart, but by altering neural discharge to the heart and depressing the sympathetic overactivity seen in 35% of patients immediately after an infarction. Our study examined the effect of timolol on sympathetic cardiac neural discharge, blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm during acute coronary occlusion produced by ligation of the left anterior descending artery 10 to 14 mm below its origin in alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats. Timolol or normal saline 5 mg/kg IV was given five minutes post coronary occlusion. The infusion of timolol significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate. Sympathetic cardiac neural discharge in the group treated with timolol five minutes post coronary occlusion did not differ from that in the saline group. Thus there was a nonuniform (an increase, a decrease, or no change) sympathetic cardiac neural discharge associated with the production of occlusion-induced arrhythmia. These data suggest that the action of timolol on the sympathetic cardiac neural discharge is not its major mode of protection.", 
    "75": "We studied the effects of a single oral dose (120 mg) of propranolol on essential tremor in 12 patients. Postural hand tremor was recorded by an accelerometer, and its amplitude and frequency determined by spectral analysis. Variable patterns of individual responses gave a mean reduction of tremor amplitude of 50% at 2 hours. Tremor was suppressed as long as 8 hours in some patients. Similar tremor reduction was found on chronic therapy. Even without treatment, tremor amplitude varied from 30 to 50%. A single oral dose of propranolol produces a rapid and sustained reduction of essential tremor, but there are diurnal fluctuations of tremor intensity regardless of treatment.", 
    "76": "We evaluated the effects of chronic massive elevations of serum GH and PRL on calcium metabolism in rats bearing the MStT/W15 and 7315a transplantable pituitary tumors. MStT/W15 tumor rats manifest elevated serum GH and PRL levels, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and elevated serum levels of PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The hypercalcemia was not reversed by dexamethasone or propranolol treatment, but was ameliorated by starvation. Parathyroidectomy produced hypocalcemia in the MStT/W15 tumor rats, confirming the parathyroid dependence of the hypercalcemia. The 7315a tumor produced a milder degree of hypercalcemia, along with elevated serum levels of PRL, ACTH, and corticosterone; serum GH was normal. In high concentrations, PRL and/or GH may stimulate the secretion of PTH as well as enhance dietary calcium absorption, in part through the mediation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.", 
    "77": "A patient with an apparent dilantin and phenobarbital overdose displayed hypotension and oliguria resistant to usual cardiotonic drugs and volume loading. In addition, she required an unusually high dose of epinephrine for resuscitation. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker not included on the drug screen, was subsequently implicated. An overdose of this drug should be suspected in patients whose hypotension is resistant to usually effective doses of inotropic and chronotropic agents.", 
    "78": "Various pharmacokinetic parameters--disposition half-life, t1/2,z, metabolic clearance CLm, volume of distribution V, intrinsic clearance of unbound drug CLuint, and unbound volume of distribution of tissues (distributive tissue volume/fraction of drug in tissue unbound, VT/fuT--are compared in rat and human for nine weakly acidic drugs, phenytoin, hexobarbital, pentobarbital, phenylbutazone, warfarin, tolbutamide, valproate, phenobarbital, and amobarbital, and six weakly basic drugs, quinidine, chlorpromazine, propranolol, pentazocin, antipyrine, and diazepam. With regard to all parameters, statistically significant correlations are obtained when parameters are plotted on a log-log plot. Correlation coefficients between the intrinsic parameters (CLuint or VT/fuT) were higher than those between the hybrid parameters (t1/2,z, CLm or V). In general, these drugs were metabolized ten times more rapidly in rat than in human. With regard to the tissue distribution of these drugs, there was little difference between rat and human. Predictions of CLm, V, and t1/2, in humans using rat data were successful for most drugs, with a few marked exceptions.", 
    "79": "Recent studies have suggested a role for adrenaline in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. In the present study, the effects of several anti-hypertensive agents were compared in normal (plasma adrenaline concentration: 0.267 + 0.040 ng/ml) and adrenomedullectomised (plasma adrenaline concentration: 0.063 + 0.011 ng/ml; p less than 0.01) dogs. The hypotensive and tachycardic effects of phentolamine (1.5 mg/kg i.v.) or dihydralazine (1 mg/kg i.v.) were the same in the two groups of dogs. Verapamil (0.2 mg/kg i.v.)-induced hypotension was less pronounced in dogs without adrenal medulla. In these adrenomedullectomised dogs, clonidine (10 micrograms/kg i.v. or 1 microgram/kg i.c.) elicited tachycardia and its hypotensive properties were delayed. In dogs with neurogenic hypertension, the antihypertensive properties of propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) remained unchanged. These results show the importance of adrenal medulla in the antihypertensive action of clonidine, or verapamil. These agents (but not dihydralazine, propranolol or phentolamine) could reduce adrenaline secretion from the adrenal medulla.", 
    "80": "In an experimental study indirect sino-atrial conduction time (SACT) was measured, using continuous pacing method from right and left atrial sites, and compared with direct SACT obtained from sinus node potential recording, all the determination being done before and after autonomic blockade. The distance between the two sites of stimulation may be taken into account as a correction factor for SACT determination. The SACT obtained with sinus node potential technique is the same as the indirect SACT after autonomic blockade. These findings are valuable for SACT determination with transesophageal pacing method. Left atrial pacing, thus transesophageal pacing, is a valuable method in estimating the SACT, but a time correction and autonomic blockade is required in order to obtain a real value, eliminating the extrinsic influences.", 
    "81": "The vascular system of extirpated cat legs was perfused with Tyrode's solution and insulin-like immunoreactivity (ILI) levels were determined in the perfusate with radioimmunoassay. During unstimulated conditions perfusate levels of ILI were almost undetectable. However, in response to electrical stimulation of the sciatic or brachial nerves (within a wide range of stimuli 5-40 V, 2-20 Hz and 0.2-40 ms) 1-20 ng of ILI was recorded in the perfusate. Blockers of cholinergic and adrenergic transmissions added to the perfusate did not influence the output of the ILI induced by nerve stimulation. Furthermore, after administration of acetylcholine (ACh) (0.1 and 10 micrograms kg-1), oxytocin (0.5 and 5 IU kg-1), glibenclamide (25 and 100 micrograms kg-1) and bombesin (100 and 500 micrograms kg-1) to the cat leg preparation, ILI appeared in the perfusate in amounts similar to those induced by electrical stimulation of the nerves. When subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) the insulin-like peptide detected in the cat leg perfusate following nervous stimulation, or administration of oxytocin and glibenclamide, co-eluted with a bovine insulin standard. We have previously shown that some peripheral nerves of the cat, such as the sciatic, brachial and vagal nerves, contain an insulin-like peptide with HPLC characteristics similar to the bovine insulin standard. It is therefore possible that the insulin-like peptide released from the isolated cat leg preparation by the above-mentioned stimuli derives from this nervous pool of insulin. Alternatively, the insulin-like peptide emanates from the striatal muscles innervated by the sciatic and brachial nerves, since also muscles have been shown to contain an insulin-like peptide."
