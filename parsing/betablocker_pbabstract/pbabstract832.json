Dichloroisoproterenol, an inhibitor of the beta receptor of the catecholamines, inhibits the action of the catecholamines but not of cyclic AMP.", 
    "1": "To evaluate the adrenergic regulation of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function, LES pressure, LES relaxation during swallowing, and blood pressure were measured in the anesthetized opossum, Didelphis virginiana, during intravenous administration of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Studies were done in controls and animals adrenergically denervated with 6-hydroxydopamine. Alpha adrenergic agonists (norepinephrine, phenylephrine) increased LES pressure and blood pressure, whereas a beta adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol) decreased both pressures. Alpha adrenergic antagonism (phentolamine) reduced basal LES pressure by 38.3+/-3.8% (mean +/-SEM) (P < 0.001). Beta adrenergic antagonism (propranolol) had no significant effect on either basal LES pressure or percent of LES relaxation with swallowing. After adrenergic denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine, basal LES pressure was reduced by 22.5+/-5.3% (P < 0.025) but LES relaxation during swallowing was unaltered. In denervated animals, both LES pressure and blood pressure dose response curves showed characteristics of denervation supersensitivity to alpha but not to beta adrenergic agonists. These studies suggest: (a) a significant portion of basal LES pressure is dependent upon alpha adrenergic stimulation; (b) LES relaxation during swallowing is not an adrenergically mediated response; (c) the LES pressure response to alpha adrenergic agonists after 6-hydroxydopamine may serve as a model of denervation supersensitivity in the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "2": "During perfusion with a glucose concentration of 150 mg/100 ml, infusions of l-epinephrine, l-norepinephrine, and d-l-isoproterenol at physiological concentrations of 2 ng/ml for 9 min stimulated secretion of glucagon in a monophasic response pattern, in contrast to the biphasic response normally encountered after glucagon releasing stimuli as previously reported from our laboratory (1971. J. Clin. Invest.50: 2123). Glucagon was stimulated in spite of a glucose concentration which in itself effectively inhibits glucagon release. Release of insulin was strongly inhibited after epinephrine and norepinephrine, and strongly stimulated after isoproterenol. During perfusion with a glucose concentration of 25 mg/100 ml, secretion of glucagon was greatly accentuated by the catechols investigated. Secretion of insulin remained unchanged after epinephrine and norepinephrine, but was stimulated by isoproterenol. The catechol induced glucagon release was suppressed or abolished when the beta-blocking agent propanolol was simultaneously infused at a concentration of 1 muM, while the inhibition of insulin became further accentuated. The catechol induced glucagon release remained unchanged when alpha blockade was performed using either phentolamine (1 muM) or dibenzyline (10 mug/ml), while the inhibition of insulin was converted to a stimulation. Evidence is thus presented that both the alpha cells and the bet cells are under the influence of adrenergic substances, the stimulation of glucagon release being mediated through a beta receptor and the inhibition of insulin release being mediated through an alpha receptor.", 
    "3": "A self-administered symptom questionnaire was completed by 477 patients in a hypertension clinic. The complaints of the patients were analysed according to the type of therapy being given and the dose of drug taken. Methyldopa therapy was associated with sleepiness, weakness of the limbs, sleeping longer at night, and rising more frequently at night to pass urine. Diarrhoea, impotence, failure of ejaculation, blurred vision, depression, and the symptoms of postural hypotension were not related to methyldopa therapy. Bethanidine administration was related to postural hypotension, impotence, and failure of ejaculation but not to weakness of the limbs, blurred vision, depression, or diarrhoea. Patients receiving guanethidine complained of postural hypotension, failure of ejaculation, and had their bowels open more frequently. Similarly, patients receiving propranolol had an increased frequency of defaecation but also tended to complain of weakness of the limbs.Considering each drug individually, 5% of patients failed to take the prescribed dose of diuretic whereas"
