    "0": "A comparative study of the beta-receptor blockers propranolol, pindolol and carazolol, with respect to their cardio-protective properties against stress (hypoxia or isoprenaline injection) in rats showed the following. The beta-blockers investigated protected the heart against glycogen depletion during hypoxia. Carazolol was active at considerably lower doses than pindolol (about 25 times less) and propranolol (about 100 times later). All three beta-blockers protected against the induction of cardiac necroses by isoprenaline, but only carazolol produced almost complete protection. There is a good correlation between the protection against the development of cardiac necroses and the inhibition of tachycardia induced by isoprenaline (r = 0.96). The results are discussed from the point of view of the possible mechanisms by which the beta-blockers prevent cardiac damage induced by stress situations.", 
    "1": "In 12 normal volunteers the interaction between the metabolic and cardiovascular effects of adrenaline and either a cardioselective (atenolol 150 mg p. o. for 1 week) or a non-selective beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (pindolol 15 mg p. o. for 1 week) were studied. Equiactive doses of the beta-blockers were investigated with respect to their metabolic effects. There were profound differences in the metabolic profile of the two substances: the non-cardioselective beta-blocker caused significant inhibition of the lipolytic, glycogenolytic and the growth hormone-releasing effects of adrenaline when compared to the cardioselective agent. The results indicate that, during non-cardioselective beta-blockade, metabolic effects occur which should favourably influence myocardial oxygen consumption by making myocardial performance more economical.", 
    "2": "In 13 healthy volunteers, ergometric examinations in the supine position after intake of 2 x 40 mg/d (-)-1-(tert.-butyl-amino)-3-(o-cyclopentylphenoxy)-2-propanol (penbutolol, Betapressin), a new beta-adrenergic receptor blocking substance, or 3 x 60 mg/d N-(3,3-diphenylpropyl)-alpha-methyl-phenethylamine (prenylamine, Segontin) showed no alteration of the exercise tolerance compared to controls. Also there was a significant decrease of heart rate and systolic pressure and an increase of the maximal heart volume at rest and during exercise after intake of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drug. The increased heart volume decreased slightly during exercise as was observed in the controls. Diastolic blood pressure increased during exercise. After intake of the calcium antagonist prenylamine there was a slight decrease of heart rate and systolic pressure and an increase of the maximal heart volume. The increased heart volume decreased again during exercise as well as the diastolic pressure. Therefore the sparing of myocardial oxygen uptake can be explained by the decrease of heart rate and systolic pressure during beta-adrenergic blockade and during prenylamine because of an additional decreased afterload resulting from decreased diastolic pressure. Furthermore in the case of both drugs, the increased myocardial oxygen uptake caused by increased heart volume, will be decreased during exercise.", 
    "3": "The present study was undertaken in order to obtain further informations on non-beta-antiadrenergic properties of the four beta-sympatholytic agents acebutolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, and propranolol. Standardized experiments were performed using a chronically reserpinized canine preparation for the assessment of dose-response curves of changes in hemodynamics, left ventricular contractility, heart rate, AV-conduction time, and myocardial oxygen consumption especially at therapeutic doses. Our results show that acebutolol and oxprenolol, at doses clinically recommended, exert moderate positive inotropic effects but do not influence heart rate significantly. Pindolol has a strong both positive chronotropic and inotropic efficacy, even at small therapeutic doses. Propranolol produces neither chronotropic nor inotropic effects. In contrast to the literature acebutolol exerts direct cardiodepression at doses clinically used, whereas oxprenolol, pindolol, at propranolol have no direct cardiodepressant properties at those doses. Thus the relationship between the dose requirements for chronotropic and inotropic sympathomimetic effects differs for each beta-sympatholytic agents, and in may prove impossible to get an order of intrinsic sympathomimetic potency of beta-blockers comparing dose-response curves of heart rate changes only. As shown in the case of acebutolol, direct cardiodepression of beta-sympatholytic agents may occur at therapeutic doses.", 
    "4": "Aqueous humor and serum levels of five beta-adrenergic blockers were measured using gas chromatographic techniques following ocular instillation of 1% solutions to rabbits. Octanol/buffer partition ratios were also determined. No apparent relationship was found between the peak levels of the agents in aqueous humor and their octanol/buffer partition ratios. However, peak aqueous humor levels of timolol (461 ng/100 mg) and practolol (919 ng/100 mg), whose partition ratios were less than unity, occurred somewhat later (1 h) than the peaks of propranolol (859 ng/100 mg at 30 min), oxprenolol (1,771 ng/100 mg at 30 min) or alprenolol (1,004 ng/100 mg at 10 min) whose partition ratios exceeded unity. Peak levels in serum of timolol (8.0 ng/100 microliter), propranolol (4.2 ng/100 microliter), oxprenolol (11.5 ng/100 microliter), and alprenolol (4.5 ng/100 microliter) were achieved within 10 min and reduced to less than 15% within 4 h. Peak serum levels of practolol (9.9 ng/100 microliter) occurred somewhat later (2 h) and remained high (41%) 6 h later.", 
    "5": "By means of groups of one hundred patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery, we compared two hypotensive anesthesia techniques combining halothane, a non-depolarising myorelaxant and a beta adrenoreceptor blocking agent. Practolol, a beta 1 receptor blocker was administered to the patients of group A while those of group B received labetalol, a more recently introduced alpha and beta receptor blocker. The duration of microsurgery for each type of pathology was identical in both groups but the operation conditions (mostly the amount of bleeding) were better in group B (statistically significant). Moreover, the mean delivered halothane concentration could be reduced by 20% (from 0.85% to 0.68%). Thirty patients undergoing tympanoplasty were followed up for several months to determine the the importance of peroperative conditions in relation to the functional result of these operations. Excessive bleeding hinders the surgeon and the positioning of the implant and also, as confirmed by this study, makes the success of the tympanoplasty uncertain. Two factors likely to predispose the patient to bleeding (and able to be brought under control preoperatively) have been highlighted: these are overweight (obese status about 80 kg) and a systolic arterial blood pressure at rest above 140 torr. The various agents which were used and the reasons for their choice are discussed.", 
    "6": "The beta-adrenergic blocking agent, primidolol hydrochloride, was administered, mixed in the diet, to mice (CD-1, Charles River, France) for 18 months. Experimental groups comprised untreated controls (100/sex) and those receiving 12.5, 25 and 50 mg drug/kg body weight (50/sex). There were no non-neoplastic lesions which could be attributed to the treatment. The pattern of tumour incidence was sex-related; in females the proportion of tumour-carrying animals was significantly higher in the top dose group (48%) than in the controls (24%), whereas in males the converse was found (30% in the top dose group vs. 48% in the controls). In the top dose female group there was no one tissue in which the tumour incidence was significantly higher than in the controls. We debate whether the analysis of total tumours in the absence of a target organ is an appropriate assay for carcinogenicity. Against a background of regulatory action towards beta-blocking agents, we discuss the possibility that the results of the present study could represent either a co-carcinogenic effect of beta-blocking agents or, alternatively, a statistical contingency.", 
    "7": "The relatively high levels of dopamine compared with those of noradrenaline found in many tissues, together with the wide distribution of dopamine receptors in the periphery, suggest that the amine may have important physiological functions, and may act as a neurotransmitter in its own right. Compounds which selectively stimulate vascular and neuronal dopamine receptors, decrease vascular resistance in the mesenteric, renal and coronary vascular beds, inhibit sympathetic ganglionic transmission and decrease transmitter efflux from certain noradrenergic neurones may prove effective in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and serve, in addition, as useful pharmacological tools.", 
    "8": "The management of the congenital and inherited nephropathies is, still today, almost exclusively symptomatic. The authors relate the most important drugs and the dose used for the principal complications of these nephropathies: hypertension, hypo-dysprotidoemia, oedema, anemia, metabolic acidosis, polyuria, hypoevolutism, recurrent urinary infections. Particular care must be taken in order to provide an adequate caloric-protein allowance principally when the renal insufficiency is reached.", 
    "9": "Sodium transport in leucocytes of essential hypertensives was studied in physiological media. Untreated hypertensives have depressed values for the total and ouabain-sensitive sodium efflux rate constant. Treatment with diuretics abolished this abnormality. These results are compatible with the presence of a circulating inhibitor of sodium transport in essential hypertension.", 
    "10": "Essential hypertension is the most important cardiovascular disease in black subjects. The types of presentation, the pattern of organ involvement and the subsequent complications are similar in black races. The response (or lack of response) to different types of treatment are also alike in blacks when compared with caucasians. Striking racial differences are observed in the plasma and intracellular electrolytes, cation transmembrane transport, salt taste threshold, plasma renin activity and urinary kallikrein activity. The similarities within the black racial groups are very likely to be genetic, although the pattern of inheritance remains controversial. Differences, however, occur in the prevalence and severity of the disease among the black racial groups. That these differences are due partly to environmental causes can not be disputed because even within the same ethnic groups changing patterns are observed in the prevalence of hypertension, in the course of urbanization of rural communities, or on moving from a previously rural to an urban environment. Consequently, genetic factors may be the only important considerations in the severity of hypertension in black subjects.", 
    "11": "In the human fetus the adrenergic system develops morphologically at an early stage. The development of adrenergic receptors occurs to a large extent before birth. The human fetus is capable of a large production of catecholamines, particularly during the last two months of fetal life. Normal labour and delivery elicits an increased release of catecholamines, a reaction that is markedly enhanced by asphyxia. beta-Receptor stimulants not only relax the uterine smooth muscle but also tend to modify the concentration of surfactant in lung fluid. beta-Receptor blocking agents, both non-selective and cardioselective, create a problem in clinical medicine since they provide an effective means of treating hypertension in pregnancy. Theoretical implications of such treatment present a risk to the fetus. Experimental evidence from the fetal sheep preparation indicate that beta-receptor blockade carriers an immediate risk to the severely asphyxiated fetus when the blockade is induced acutely. In this situation heart muscle contractility, heart rate and cardiac output fall abruptly while the capacity for anaerobic glycolysis is greatly diminished. Even though such acute animal experiments are far removed from clinical practice the results suggest that great caution should be exercised in the use of adrenergic blocking agents in obstetric practice.", 
    "12": "The development of the autonomic nervous system in relation to perinatal metabolism is reviewed with particular attention given to the adipocyte, hepatocyte and the A and B cells of the islets of Langerhans. Adrenergic receptors develop in the B cell independently of normal innervation and by the time of birth, in most species studied, the pancreas, liver and adipose tissue respond appropriately to autonomic signals. Birth is associated with a huge surge in circulating catecholamines which is probably responsible for the early postnatal rise in free fatty acids and glucagon concentrations in plasma. beta-Blocking drugs such as propranolol have an adverse effect on fetal growth and neonatal metabolism, being responsible for hypoglycemia and for impairing the thermogenic response to cold exposure. beta-Mimetic drugs are commonly used to prevent premature labour and may help the fetus in other ways, for example, by improving the placental blood supply and the delivery of nutrients by increasing maternal fat and carbohydrate mobilization.", 
    "13": "A water soluble material, isolated from Cannabis sativa, has been tested in albino and pigmented rabbits and rhesus monkeys for both ocular and systemic effects. Intravenous administration produced a dose-related fall in intraocular pressure in both albino and pigmented rabbits with concentrations as low as 0.005 mg/animal being effective, but no response was found in monkeys. High concentrations (0.2 to 1 mg/animal) induced a hypertensive phase in intraocular pressure prior to the ocular hypotension; higher concentrations (2 or 5 mg/animal) also induced antidiuresis and general relaxation. Tachyphylaxis was found to repeated daily injections. Alpha and beta-adrenergic antagonists caused some reduction of the hypertensive phase but had no effect on the hypotensive phase. Superior cervical ganglionectomy did not influence the time course of the intraocular pressure response. Indomethacin inhibited the hypertensive intraocular pressure phase but was ineffective against the hypotensive phase. Systemic blood pressure was unchanged following intravenous administration of 0.2 mg material/animal. Aqueous tumor protein concentration was increased at both 1 and 6 hours after intravenous administration, becoming greater at the later time. Aqueous humor turnover rate was substantially reduced reaching a minimum 8.75 hours after administration. Topical administration was ineffective in eyes when the epithelium was removed in rabbits with and without pretreatment with aspirin. Neither gastric nor suppository administration of large quantities (10 mg or greater) of material had any influence on intraocular pressure.", 
    "14": "The authors tested metipranolol (Trimepranol Spofa) for its effect in the ischaemic focus in the dog. Electrodes were sutured on the left ventricular myocardial surface and a ligature was prepared on the descending branch of the left coronary artery. One week after the operation the artery was ligated without chest opening, and electrograms were recorded. Twenty-four hours after the ligation the activity of creatine phosphokinase was determined and the histological changes were examined in samples of myocardial tissue underlying the individual electrodes. The findings in control dogs and in dogs treated with Trimepranol were compared. Trimepranol manifested itself by an early decrease of heart rate and decrease of ST segments elevations in the electrograms from the myocardial surface. Twenty-four hours after coronary artery ligation no Q waves developed in a half of the sites under the exploring electrodes in the peripheral zone and there was higher preservation of CK activity in the corresponding tissue specimens. Moreover in the treated dogs the occurrence of early ventricular arrhythmias was reduced. The study proved a protective effect of the beta-blocking agent Trimepranol in the peripheral zone of the ischaemic focus in canine myocardium.", 
    "15": "Description of a non invasive model to determine the negative-chronotropic effect, which leads to well stabilized parameters by tailoring. Basis of the model is the work-induced tachycardia at which the work-induced increase of frequency is measured at a specified time after 10 preliminary ergometries for the elimination of training effects. The parameter for the effect is the difference of frequencies at nominal time before and after administration of beta-adrenolytic drug. The relevance of the model is shown at the example of acebutolol (Neptal 400) in various high dosages.", 
    "16": "Women with previously untreated arterial hypertension have been followed up during ten years of beta-blocker treatment, first for three years with alprenolol and then for seven years with the selective beta1-blocker metoprolol. During a long-term follow-up, blood pressure levels remained at acceptable levels in all the 24 women studied during the period with alprenolol as well as during the period with metoprolol. Both drugs were well tolerated. In no case had the beta-blocker to be stopped because of side-effects. No changes ascribed to beta-blocker treatment were found when a number of laboratory data were repeatedly studied. Administering the drug b.i.d. seemed preferable to a t.i.d. administration. The majority of the subjects had their blood pressure well-controlled when the drug was administered once a day, and a once-daily regimen could probably be used in most patients with uncomplicated arterial hypertension. However, a few patients have their blood pressures better controlled with a b.i.d. regimen and some patients experienced side-effects when taking the drug once a day; these disappeared when the drug was taken b.i.d. It is therefore concluded that the choice between b.i.d. administration and a one-dose administration should be made individually for each patient.", 
    "17": "Hand blood flow and subjective sensitivity to cold were studied in nine hypertensive patients on treatment with beta-blockers. All patients complained of cold extremities. Neither hand blood flow nor sensitivity to cold changed after addition of prazosin, a well known vasodilator to the original beta-blocker. After changing to a beta-blocker with a high degree of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (pindolol), hand blood flow increased and sensitivity to cold decreased in all patients, except one.", 
    "18": "Platelet shape change responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine were examined in 11 normal subjects and in 78 patients with psychiatric disorders receiving one or more of the following classes of drug: phenothiazine, thioxanthine, butyrophenone, tricyclic antidepressant, benzodiazepine or lithium. Approximately 37% of patients received a single drug, the remainder up to 4 other compounds in addition to the main drug. Platelet shape change induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (0.25, 2.5 or 25 nmol/ml) was significantly inhibited in patients treated with phenothiazines, thioxanthines and butyrophenones (haloperidol). Tricyclic antidepressants, lithium and benzodiazepines had no effect on 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced shape change. In contrast, a combination of lithium plus chlorpromazine significantly enhanced platelet shape change. Potentiation of noradrenaline-induced aggregation was approximately 50% in normal subjects. This degree of potentiation was not altered in the drug-treated patients although there were quantitative reductions in magnitude of response. Platelet shape change in addition to platelet aggregation may be used as a pharmacological tool to investigate the aetiology of psychiatric disorders and, perhaps eventually, to monitor the clinical efficacy of drug therapy.", 
    "19": "Thirty men and five women aged 36-70 years with angina were questioned about their sexual activity. Twenty-nine (83%) had intercourse more than once a week and six (17%) abstained. In 19 (65%) angina occurred during intercourse, and four also complained of palpitation. Fourteen patients underwent 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) tape-recordings before and after beta-blockade, and indicated the time of intercourse in diary cards. Tape analysis before beta-blockade revealed an average maximal 24-hour heart rate of 124.0 +/- 7.2 beats/min, and 122.2 +/- 7.1 beats/min during intercourse. Two patients complaining of palpitation during intercourse developed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and two sinus tachycardia. Beta-blockade abolished the SVT and reduced the average maximal 24-hour heart rate to 82.1 +/- 6.0 beats/min (P less than 0.001), and 82.0 +/- 2.8 beats/min during intercourse (P less than 0.001). After 6 months, the 19 patients previously symptomatic were pain-free during intercourse, though six also required prophylactic sublingual nitrates. Four of the six who previously abstained were able to have a normal sex relationship. Twenty-four hour tape ECG recordings have shown that the heart rate during intercourse is similar to that during normal daily life. There is no reason why most patients with angina cannot have a normal sex life, and physicians should ask and advise routinely.", 
    "20": "A double blind, placebo-controlled study of the ventilatory effects of three new beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blockers was carried out in eight asthmatic patients. Measurements were performed before and 2, 3 and 4 h after ingestion of a single oral dose of placebo, atenolol 100 mg, metoprolol 100 mg or acebutolol 400 mg. At each time ventilatory indices and heart rate were assessed before, during and 15 min after an exercise test. The ventilatory indices were re-assessed after challenge with terbutaline 1.5 mg by inhalation. The three beta-blocking agents caused equal falls in exercise heart rate two hours after ingestion, indicating the equipotency of the cardiac effects. The three agents reduced significantly and to the same extent FEV1 and PEFR both before and after exercise. The respiratory indices clearly improved after stimulation with terbutaline. The response to terbutaline was less marked after acebutolol, which may indicate that it has a lower degree of beta 1-selectivity. The beta-blockers did not show any influence on bronchodilatation during exercise, or on exercise-induced bronchospasm.", 
    "21": "The interactions of agonists and antagonists with beta-adrenergic receptors appear to be fundamentally different. Antagonists only occupy the receptor while agonists bind to the receptor and induce a specific conformational change. The excellent correlation between the efficacy of full or partial agonists and the magnitude of the changes in the thermodynamic parameters associated with the binding of these compounds suggests that this conformational change is related to the ability of various drugs to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In most instances it is difficult to distinguish an agonist from an antagonist using the in vitro binding of radiolabeled ligands. The thermodynamic analysis described here represents one example of a situation in which agonists and antagonists can be distinguished using in vitro binding techniques. The complexities of agonist interactions with beta-adrenergic receptors are also clearly seen in studies of binding to intact cells and in direct studies using radiolabeled agonists. In the former studies it appeared that there were marked changes in the properties of the receptor that occurred during the 60 min that are required for the binding of IHYP to beta-adrenergic receptors on L6 myoblasts to reach equilibrium. These changes make it difficult to analyze the affinity of the receptor for agonists using intact cells. Finally, the complexities of agonist interactions with the beta-adrenergic receptor are also seen in direct binding studies with radiolabeled agonists. The curvilinear Scatchard plots and the complicated dissociation kinetics attest to this complexity. The importance of the formation of a hypothetical ternary complex between hormone, receptor, and guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein is now becoming appreciated. The existence of other components of this system will remain an important subject for future investigation. In any case, it is clear that a full understanding of this system will require the use of not only radiolabeled agonists and antagonists but also of both broken and intact cells.", 
    "22": "The probability of experiencing adverse drug reactions increases with age. Polypharmacy, pharmacokinetic changes (altered drug distribution, reduced renal and hepatic drug clearances), unusual pharmacological effects and impaired compensatory mechanisms are the principal reasons for the diminished tolerance of elderly patients to several drugs. Especially neuroleptics, antidepressants, tranquilizers, digoxin, potent diuretics, betablockers, and antiarrhythmics have to be employed with special care. To prevent adverse reactions in geriatric patients, prescriptions should be limited to a few essential drugs, dosage reduced, and dosing regimens simplified. However, therapeutic nihilism can never be justified by old age alone.", 
    "23": "Anti-hypertensives, diuretics, digitalis, beta-blockers, nitrates, anti-arrhythmics, and psychiatric drugs are reviewed for their effects on the cardiovascular response to exercise, in particular work capacity, heart rate, blood pressure, anginal threshold, and exertional arrhythmias. The limitations of these measurements to assess changes in the various aspects of cardiovascular performance in the presence of drugs becomes evident, emphasizing the need for an understanding of the relationship between drug effects on specific target organs and the altered integrated exercise response. The variable response of individuals to drug therapy, depending on the pathophysiological effects of their disease, demonstrates the value of exercise testing in selecting optimal drug regimens.", 
    "24": "The authors present a survey of the side effects of beta-blocking agents. Practolol has been linked with a lupus syndrome characterized by biological abnormalities and eventually clinical signs; later on, other beta-blocking agents have been able to induce such manifestations. Thus, all beta-blocking agents proved hazardous and they must be prescribed with extreme caution in patients with immunological imbalance. Furthermore, pruritus and lichenoid or psoriasiform dermatitis have been documented. This must be kept in mind in the presence of any unspecific rash in elderly patients.", 
    "25": "The drug treatment of hypertension occurring during pregnancy is described. Diagnostic problems and management are outlined, and the available literature regarding the use of standard hypotensive agents in pregnancy is reviewed by drug class. Based on currently published literature and opinion, the following drugs are recommended when needed during pregnancy (with proper monitoring) : methyldopa, hydralazine, and furosemide. Caution is recommended when the following drugs are used during pregnancy: propranolol, and thiazide diuretics. The following drugs are not recommended for use during pregnancy based on currently available information: reserpine, clonidine, chlorthalidone, prazosin, minoxidil, spironolactone, ethacrynic acid, metoprolol, nadolol, and guanethidine.", 
    "26": "In 20 patients with stable angina pectoris, o-[3-(tert.-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]-benzonitrile (bunitrolol) was compared with placebo in a double blind cross-over trial, with monthly treatment periods. There was no difference in the subjective condition of the patient. The bunitrolol treated patients showed a significantly better work capacity (P less than 0.05) and pressure-rate product (P less than 0.01) in the exercise tests. No significant difference could be found in the ST-segment changes. The bunitrolol patients showed a significant reduction in heart rate at rest (P less than 0.01); a significant difference in blood pressure was not found. Bunitrolol is an effective beta-adrenergic blocker, without side-effects in this trial.", 
    "27": "Heating rats exposed 30' to a 40 degrees C environmental temperature increases plasma renin activity (PRA). Propranolol as such decreased PRA, but heating propranolol-treated rats induced also an increased PRA. Hexamethonium increases PRA, that increases additionally when rats are heated. It may be concluded that increased PRA by heating is produced by other ways as catecholamine response and stimulation of beta-receptors, despite the important sympatho-adrenergic reaction that occurred in this circumstance [6], [13], probably by a decreased glomerular filtration rate and consequently that of Na in macula densa. Hyperthermia produced also an important plasma aldosterone increased concentration.", 
    "28": "The pharmacokinetics of prenalterol, a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, has been studied in healthy subjects, by following the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of the unchanged compound and its total radioactive metabolites after oral and intravenous administration. Each of six healthy subjects received a single i.v. dose (2.5 mg) and three oral doses (2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg) of prenalterol. The oral dose was administered as a solution. Three of the subjects received the intravenous and oral doses of 2.5 mg as tritiated drug. Prenalterol was rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The peak plasma concentration was attained after about 0.5 h. About 25% of prenalterol reached the systemic circulation. Prenalterol was extensively distributed to extravascular tissues with a half-life of the distribution phase close to 7 min. About 90% of the dose was excreted in urine within 24 h irrespective of the route of administration, indicating complete absorption of the drug. On average 60% of the i.v. and 13% of the oral doses were excreted as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life of the compound was 1.8 h, and the decline in the plasma concentration of the metabolites indicated a slower elimination rate than for the unchanged drug. Dose-dependent kinetics were not observed after the oral doses examined.", 
    "29": "The relationship between cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow and arterial CO2 tension was investigated during anaesthesia induced by halothane, pentobarbital, ethanol and nitrous oxide. The results obtained by halothane, pentobarbital and ethanol indicate a relationship between central suppressants and CO2 in decreasing CMRO2. During nitrous oxide anaesthesia, CMRO2 increased with increasing CO2 tension, an effect which could be prevented by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. This indicates a role of catecholaminergic mechanisms in CMRO2 regulation (as is the case during immobilization stress and ethanol withdrawal) perhaps as a protective measure providing increased energy supply in the central nervous system during conditions of endogenous or exogenous stress.", 
    "30": "A 3-year prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between plasma renin activity levels and the incidence of cardiovascular complications in white patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension treated with various beta-adrenergic blocking agents (oxprenolol, pindolol, propranolol, sotalol and timolol). During the follow-up study, 4 (5.9%) of 68 treated patients and 10 (41.7%) of 24 non-treated patients (p less than 0.001) developed cardiovascular complications. The cardiovascular events occurred more frequently in patients with low renin activity levels and in patients with severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressure above 120 mmHg). An increase in plasma renin activity levels was observed following cardiovascular complications in both groups of patients. No cases of myocardial infarction occurred among the treated patients, while 5 cases (3 fatal) of proven myocardial infarction occurred among the non-treated patients. The results of this study suggest that low plasma renin activity levels have no \"protective effect\" on the incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with essential hypertension. The fact that no cases of myocardial infarction were observed among patients treated with various beta-adrenergic blocking drugs suggests that these drugs may have a \"cardioprotective\" effect on ischaemic heart disease in patients with essential hypertension. This hypothesis should be confirmed by further trials.", 
    "31": "Haemodynamic function was assessed in twenty patients with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. In front of the earlier well-known data hypercinetic circulatory status was found with vascular resistance almost unchanged. As some investigators found two levels placental blood flow, haemodynamic status may be different in some cases. Consequences on therapy are discussed especially beta-bloquers and potential deleterious effects of anti-hypertensive treatments.", 
    "32": "The beta-blocking agent Nadolol and the beta- and alpha-blocking agent Labetalol were screened for their potential efficacy on intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma. Nadolol 2% and Labetalol 1% in aqueous solution were investigated in a single-dose manner on the basis of a double-masked clinical trial. Only Nadolol reduced IOP significantly which was maximal 4 h after drug application and had a duration of action of at least 6 h and less than 24 h. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and pupil diameter were not significantly affected, and Labetalol did not change either parameter significantly. It is concluded that Nadolol may be of use in glaucoma therapy.", 
    "33": "Oral provocation tests revealed the relation between long-term oral use of metoprolol and development of psoriasiform and/or eczematous skin lesions in 3 patients. The clinical and histopathological findings in 1 case are described more in detail and are discussed. The data in the recent literature, with respect to side effects of skin due to different beta-blocking agents, are summarized. In addition, some aspects dealing with possible mechanism in the side effects of beta-blocking agents are briefly discussed. Since beta-blocking agents may cause similar side effects, as described during practolol treatment, on should still be alert to this possibility during long-term treatment with (new) beta-blocking agents, which may allow us to prevent serious damage that might occur in different organs.", 
    "34": "Measurements of plasma pancreatic polypeptide and gastrin are reported for the first time in patients with acute myocardial infarction and compared with clinical signs of vagal or sympathetic overactivity. Pancreatic polypeptide concentrations were assessed as an index of vagal activity, but elevated values of pancreatic polypeptide found in 7 of the 13 patients on admission did not correlate with clinical evidence of vagal overactivity. The mean pancreatic polypeptide concentrations were not higher in patients with clinical vagal overactivity than in patients with clinical sympathetic overactivity during the 12 h after the onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction. Mean gastrin levels were significantly higher on admission and at 4, 5, 6 and 8 h after the onset of infarction in the patients with clinical features of sympathetic overactivity than in the patients with clinical vagal overactivity. Thus plasma gastrin warrants further assessment as an index of sympathetic overactivity in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "35": "Significant structural, functional and metabolic differences between the right and left ventricles are present already in control animals. Intermittent high altitude (IHA) hypoxia (4 hr daily, 5 days a week, stepwise up to an altitude of 7000 m in a hypobaric chamber) induced in adult rats pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy; prolonged hypoxia also increased the relative left ventricular mass. Both chambers show proportionate increase in concentration of myofibrilar and collagenous proteins; the right-left difference, characteristic of animals living in normoxic environment, remains unaffected. The relative right and left ventricular bloodflow in hypoxic animals increases and so doses also the activity of glycolytic enzymes in both ventricles. Necrotic lesions, localized predominantly in the right ventricle, develop only at the beginning of adaptation to IHA. Parallel changes in the structure and enzyme activity of the myosine molecule in both ventricles can be observed. Administration of beta-blocking agent (Trimepranol, Spofa) significantly decreased pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy; the relative left ventricular mass normalized. Furthermore, Trimepranol significantly reduced necrotic changes in the right ventricle after a dose of 10 mg/kg, in the left ventricle - after 1 mg/kg. These results support the hypothesis of a possible impairment of left ventricular function in the presence of a primary right ventricular disturbance.", 
    "36": "We investigated the effectiveness of the beta-blocking agent metipranolol in preventing detrimental systemic and myocardial alterations induced in healthy dogs by adrenaline (AD) infused at a rate which mimics spontaneous secretion after coronary occlusion. Metipranolol (0.3 mg/kg) was infused intravenously concurrently with AD (1.2 micrograms/kg/min) for 4 h and blood values of free fatty acids (FFA) and triiodothyronine(T3) were measured initially, after 2 and 4 h of infusion and compared with those obtained in dogs infused with AD alone and with saline. Metipranolol suppressed a rise in free fatty acid, reversed AD-induced histoenzymatic changes in succinic dehydrogenase and ATPase activity and considerably inhibited the development of mitochondrial alterations detected in dogs infused with AD alone. A tendency to attenuate AD-induced fall in serum T3 was also detected in metipranolol-treated dogs. Results suggest that this drug might be of value in preventing consequences of increased adrenergic activity in the acute stage of myocardial infarction.", 
    "37": "Muscle cells dissociated from 5-day embryonic chicken hearts showed dose-dependent increases in both chronotropic rates of contraction and cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in response to epinephrine (EPI), an effect that could be blocked by beta-adrenergic antagonists. However, 2- to 2.5-day embryonic chicken myocardial cells, although similar to 5-day heart cells with respect to the organization of myofibrils, failed to respond to EPI either by increased rates of contraction or by elevated levels of intracellular cAMP. Development of beta-adrenergic sensitivity in 2- to 2.5-day cells did not occur even after several days of growth in culture. However, addition of an extract prepared from 11-day chicken embryos to 2- to 2.5-day muscle cell cultures at any point during in vitro growth resulted in the development of sensitivity to EPI as measured by increases in both the beating frequency and cAMP levels after a 48-hr incubation in embryo extract (EE). The basal level of cAMP in cells unresponsive to EPI is 5 times that in EPI-sensitive muscle cells from older hearts (5 days). The high basal level of cAMP in these cells is reduced to a level characteristic of cells from older hearts when treated with the EE. Once sensitivity was acquired, it was retained as a stable trait of the muscle cells in culture. Furthermore, EE-treated 2- to 2.5-day cells showed less reduction of positive chronotropy in response to multiple doses of EPI than did cells prepared from 5-day hearts. Fractionation of EE on Sephadex G-200 showed that the activity was present in the large-molecule fractions. It is concluded that the development of beta-adrenergic sensitivity can be induced in unresponsive heart cells cultured from 2- to 2.5-day embryos by a factor(s) in the EE that is not adsorbed on Sephadex G-200.", 
    "38": "The influence of social isolation in rats on postsynaptic alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors, on the cAMP generating system and on the presynaptic uptake mechanism in the central noradrenergic system was examined in different brain regions. Rearing rats in isolation from the 19th day of life for 12 weeks leads in all regions to a general tendency for a reduction in 3H-DHA binding, to an enhanced 3H-WB4101 binding and to a decreased responsiveness of the noradrenaline sensitive cAMP generating system. These changes reach significant only in the pons-medulla-thalamus region. Isolated rats showed an increased synaptosomal uptake of noradrenaline, most pronounced and significant in the hypothalamus. Our data provide further support for a disturbance in central noradrenergic function in isolated rats.", 
    "39": "The authors compare the effects of beta-blockers without intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA) (propranolol, 160 mg/day), moderate ISA (acebutolol, 800 mg/day) and high ISA (pindolol, 20 mg/day). The sinus rate decreases more with propranolol than with acebutolol, during the day (P less than 0.01) and during the night (P less than 0.001), whereas pindolol does not change the daylight rate and increases the nighttime rate (P less than 0.001). The ventricular rate during atrial fibrillation (AV nodal transmission) is modified as is sinus rate. There is no significant difference between propranolol and acebutolol, and a highly significant difference between pindolol and propranolol (P less than 0.001) or acebutolol (P less than 0.01). Moreover, the eurythmic effect of beta-blockers, making RR intervals more regular, is maximal with propranolol and minimal with pindolol, as judged on RR interval histograms. The ISA of the beta-blockers is of major importance for the clinical use of these drugs, and in the case of SA or AV node dysfunction ISA can be useful, but it can obscure the beneficial effects of beta-blocking therapy.", 
    "40": "The term \"calcium antagonist\" has been used for more than a decade to describe a group of drugs whose negative inotropism is overcome by calcium. Because this term lacks specificity with respect to a precise mode of action, and implies a classical receptor-agonist-antagonist relationship, its continued use should be questioned. Drugs belonging to this group are verapamil, D600, nifedipine and diltiazem. They inhibit the slow inward current of the action potential and would more appropriately be called \"slow channel inhibitors\". The group is heterogenous and may have to be subclassified. The negative inotropism of these drugs can be attributed to a reduction of the slow calcium current. The function of most intracellular organelles is unaffected. Studies with radioactively labelled verapamil show tight binding to glycolipids or glycoproteins in the sarcolemma. Consequent change in the conformational state of the cell membrane could inhibit the slow calcium current. The ability of these drugs to protect heart muscle against the deleterious effects of ischaemia and reperfusion may reflect their negative inotropism, with consequent maintenance of tissue ATP above the levels needed to maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, rather than a direct inhibitory effect on calcium influx during ischaemia or on reperfusion.", 
    "41": "Hypoglycemia was induced in ten healthy male volunteers during medication with atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol. The beta-blockers abolished the tachycardia during hypoglycemia. In some subjects bradycardia, and in two nodal bradycardia was observed on propranol. The physiologic blood pressure responses were dampend during the beta1-selective blockade. With propranolol a rise in blood pressure was recorded, in two subjects up to 160/105. The blockers had no effect on degree of hypoglycemia or glucose recovery.", 
    "42": "In 39 selected patients with open-angle glaucoma, in whom pressure regulation with Timolol alone was inadequate, success was achieved by using this drug in combination with various other glaucoma drugs over treatment periods of 12 to 18 months. In all cases, Timolol had had a significant, thought inadequate pressure-lowering effect; only by adding either 0.5%-2% pilocarpine. 0.75-2.25% carbachol, 2% aceclidine, 0.1% epinephrine or 250 mg of acetazolamide could IOP be lowered effectively to an acceptable level.", 
    "43": "Diabetes Mellitus is the most common endocrine disease found in children, and its reported incidence is increasing. Most investigators now agree that improved diabetic control is effective in decreasing both long and short term complications. The delineation of factors which affect control are, therefore, of importance. Classically, the physician has emphasized insulin dose, presence of infection, diet, and exercise. Emotional factors have long been thought to play a role in diabetes mellitus. The exact nature of this role, however, has been rather elusive and controversial. The authors review this literature, summarize the major viewpoints, and conclude that physiological factors can influence the physiology of the disease. The focus of this paper is the synthesis of recent advances in basic metabolic, endocrinologic, and stress research, relevant to juvenile diabetes, into a psychophysiologic model. The authors discuss future research directions necessary for clarification of the model, as well as its psychological and physiological therapeutic implications.", 
    "44": "There is extensive experience in the treatment of hyperthyroidism with beta-blockade. Because of the short half-life of propranolol the drug must be taken in divided doses. The effect of a single daily dose of a long-acting beta-blocking drug, nadolol, was investigated in 7 hyperthyroid patients. A satisfactory and prolonged reduction in heart rate was observed during continuous monitoring over a 24-hour period. Nadolol, therefore, is a possible alternative to propranolol in the treatment of hyperthyroidism with an advantage in the poorly-compliant patient.", 
    "45": "1 The effects of propranolol on phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced transformation of murine T lymphocytes and capping of anti-IgG on the surface of murine B lymphocytes have been examined. 2 A 50% inhibition of transformation was observed with 10(-5) M propranolol, whereas a higher concentration, of the order of 10(-3) M propranolol was required to inhibit capping by 50%. The (+)-and (-)-isomers of propranolol proved equipotent in these respects, and the relative potencies of selected analogues of propranolol (alprenolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol, practolol, and sotalol) coincided with their potencies as membrane stabilizers; however, lymphocyte transformation was consistently more sensitive than capping. 3 Similar effects were also seen with quinidine, chlorpromazine and lignocaine, and it was concluded that the inhibition of both lymphocyte functions was due to the membrane stabilizing actions of propranolol.", 
    "46": "Quinidine combined with propranolol produces antiarrhythmic synergism. The mechanism is uncertain but has been suggested as possibly due to increased activity of quinidine made possible by myocardial beta adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol. In the present study, identical doses of quinidine were coadministered with doses of propranolol and of sotalol that produced equivalent beta blockade. Antiarrhythmic activity was measured as decreased ventricular vulnerability to electrical fibrillation in the dog and prevention of chloroform-induced ventricular fibrillation in the mouse. The two drug combinations did not produce equivalent antiarrhythmic activity because only quinidine-propranolol produced antiarrhythmic synergism.", 
    "47": "The glucose dependent glucagon and insulin responses to electrical vagal stimulation in anesthetized splanchnicotomized young pigs were studied after administration of various pharmacological blocking agents. Hexamethonium completely abolished the responses, regardless of the glucose level. Atropine was without effect on the glucagon as well as the insulin response, regardless of stimulation frequency, glucose level, or dose of atropine. Neither propranolol nor a combination of propranolol and phenoxybenzamine inhibited the response. Our findings indicate that neither adrenergic fibres nor fibres impinging on muscarinic cholinergic receptors are involved in the pancreatic endocrine response to vagal stimulation.", 
    "48": "Long-term clinical effects of beta-blockers (propranolol in most cases) and calcium inhibitors (nifedipine in most cases) were studied in 16 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. On overall subjective symptoms, beta-blockers were effective in 50% of symptomatic patients, while calcium inhibitors were effective in only 33%. On angina pectoris, however, calcium inhibitors were superior to beta-blockers in our patients. Blood pressure decreased with each drug, and the decrease was significant with nifedipine. Otherwise there was no change in physical findings with either drug. Long-term (more than 6 months) use of beta-blockers resulted in an increase in cardiothoracic ratio on chest X-ray, a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram and more pronounced ST-T change on electrocardiogram. Prolonged use of nifedipine resulted in a slight decrease in cardiothoracic ratio, but no systematic change on echocardiogram and on electrocardiogram.", 
    "49": "K+-sensitive liquid ion exchange electrode systems respond with a slow potential change to acetylcholine, choline, anticholinergic drugs, biogenic amines, and glutamic acid. The response threshold has been defined, and in most cases it is at extremely low concentrations (10(-7)-10(-5)M). The direction of the potential change varies, but in most instances it is additive to that produced by external K+. The K+ electrode system is further sensitive to decreasing pH, within a narrow and possibly physiological range of pH. These findings suggest that small measured changes in extracellular K+ are biased by the chemosensitivity of the liquid ion exchange electrode system to some compounds of physiological importance.", 
    "50": "The article first includes a discussion on the classification of catecholamine receptors followed by a discussion on the binding studies of beta-receptors and their affinity labeling. Next a brief discussion on the solubilization and the current attempts to purify the receptor is presented. A large section is then devoted to the mode of coupling between beta-receptors and cyclase where much space is devoted to the role of GTP and of the membrane matrix. The review ends with a discussion on beta-receptor desensitization, supersensitivity, and the \"spare receptor\" concept.", 
    "51": "The effects of selective histamine receptor analogs were studied in spontaneously beating rabbit atria. Atrial rate was increased by histamine (an H1 and H2 agonist), 4-methylhistamine and impromidine (H2 agonists), and 2-pyridylethylamine (PEA, an H1 agonist). The responses to histamine, 4-methylhistamine, and impromidine were not affected by propranolol (1 x 10(-7) M) or reserpine pretreatment. However, the response to PEA was nearly abolished upon pretreatment with propranolol or reserpine. Cimetidine pretreatment (H2 receptor blockade) competitively antagonised the positive chronotropic effects of histamine, 4-methylhistamine, and impromidine. Promethazine pretreatment (H1 receptor blockade) competitively blocked the chronotropic effects of histamine but had no effect on the responses to 4-methylhistamine or impromidine. These results suggest that stimulation of H1 and H2 receptors will cause a positive chronotropic response."
