    "0": "We have investigated the effects of 8-OH-DPAT in the mouse isolated vas deferens preparation and found it to possess a biphasic (initial inhibition followed by potentiation) dose-response curve. The initial inhibitory phase of the dose-response curve was not antagonized by naltrexone (300 nM), idazoxan (300 nM) or propranolol (300 nM), indicating that neither opioid, alpha 2- nor beta-receptors were involved in the inhibition. (+/-)-Cyanopindolol (300 nM) was also devoid of any antagonist activity versus 8-OH-DPAT, showing that the effect of the compound is not due to 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B agonist activity. Domperidone (10 nM), fluphenthixol (30 nM) and sulpiride, three chemically dissimilar DA2 antagonists, all antagonized the effects of DPAT, indicating that the compound is acting as a dopamine agonist in this preparation. A comparison, in the same preparations, of the agonist effects of DPAT and apomorphine, showed that DPAT possesses ca 0.01 the potency of apomorphine. The dose-response curve produced by DPAT was much shallower than that produced by apomorphine, indicating that DPAT is only a partial agonist in this preparation. This was confirmed by subsequent experiments which showed that DPAT, at a concentration of 3 microM, which had no effect on dose-response curves to the opioid agonist normorphine, produced a ca 10-fold shift in the dose-response curve to dopamine.", 
    "1": "On the day of operation for acute destructive cholecystitis functions of external ventilation prove to be disturbed due to deterioration of pulmonary blood flow (2-6 times) and ventilation (1.3-3 times). The degree of these disturbances are in direct dependence on the degree of the inflammatory process in gallbladder and time of preoperative observation. At the same terms after emergency cholecystectomy the lung functions were reestablished considerably quicker and was more valuable than after operations on urgent indications. Inclusion of adrenoblocking agents into conservative treatment of acute cholecystitis before and after operation facilitates more effective and quicker recovery of lung functions.", 
    "2": "The acute renal effects of intravenous tertatolol were studied in eight patients with moderate essential hypertension: the study included a 100 mmol/day sodium intake during 3 days. Then, tertatolol was infused after a water load during 2 consecutive periods of 30 min (priming dose followed by constant infusion) in order to obtain plasma concentrations of tertatolol at 2 different levels: 10 ng/ml, then 40 ng/ml successively; the measurements were obtained at 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. The renal plasma flow (RPF) and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were calculated from the 131I-Hippuran clearance and the 125I-Iothalamate clearance respectively; a bladder catheter allowed a precise urine collection. The results indicate that intravenous tertatolol, at low dose, induced a marked and early renal vasodilatation; higher dose of tertatolol attenuated the vasodilator response, probably because of a decrease in cardiac output (suggested by the decrease in heart rate); thus, the systemic effects would hide the direct renal hemodynamic effects of tertatolol. Natriuresis and kaliuresis were unchanged by intravenous tertatolol.", 
    "3": "The aim of the study was to assess the evolution of Alerting reaction (AR) under beta blocker treatment and to discuss its incidence on the management of arterial hypertension (AH). In 28 patients (pts), 19 men, 9 females, 46 +/- 12 years old, suffering from a mild to moderate AH, blood pressure (BP) was measured, according to a ritual circuit by a nurse (N), then a 12-minutes recorded monitoring, then a physician (Ph) using a mercury sphygmomanometer in upright, then in supine position at the end of the visit (165 +/- 18/108 +/- 13 mmHg, 161 +/- 14/100 +/- 9 mmHg). Pts received a cardioselective beta blocker, bisoprolol (B), 10 mg once daily and BP was evaluated after 1 and 2 months (D30; D60) under identical conditions. When compared to monitoring BP, there was a significant increase in systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP, taken by the nurse and the physician, attributed to AR (delta SBP; delta DBP). Under B, AR remained unchanged, even increased regarding upright DBP at D30, D60 in spite of its efficacy: (formula; see text) The study demonstrates that there is no incidence of beta blocker on alerting reaction and that AR must be considered to evaluate the treatment and avoid an unnecessary or overtreatment. In case of discrepancies, it is suggested to perform an ambulatory BP monitoring.",

Isoproterenol (10(-5) M) did not affect the ion and water transport. Stimulation of beta 1-adrenergic receptor with isoproterenol and beta 2-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118.551 inhibited the fractional reabsorption of sodium, chloride and magnesium, the fluid reabsorption being changed insignificantly. Stimulation of beta 2-adrenergic receptor with ventolin increased the fractional calcium reabsorption. The transport of water and other ions did not change.",

In patients with a low baseline vascular resistance (group A, n = 20) a substantially better therapeutic effect was recorded than in patients with a markedly elevated peripheral resistance (group B, n = 11). Trimepranol is indicated in patients with a higher heart rate at rest and with a significant increase of the latter during isometric loading tests.",

    "8": "Antianginal and antiischemic effects and clinical pharmacologic actions of carvedilol, a novel beta-blocking agent with a vasodilator action, were determined by Holter electrocardiographic monitoring in 13 patients with exertional angina. The patients were observed for 1 week prior to entry into the study, followed by 1 to 2 weeks of treatment with carvedilol. During the observation period the patients received one placebo tablet daily, and during the treatment period one 20 mg tablet of carvedilol daily. Before and after the treatment 24-hour Holter electrocardiographic tracings were obtained. The mean interval of Holter monitoring was 11.2 +/- 4.5 days for the observation and treatment periods, and the mean time of drug administration was 8:25 a.m. (+/- 30 min). The Holter electrocardiographic tracings which were obtained twice in 9 patients during the observation period showed a high degree of reproducibility with respect to the frequency, magnitude and duration of ST-segment depression. The total frequency of ST depression per patient was 4.5 +/- 3.4 events/day pre-drug and 2.1 +/- 2.1 events/day post-drug. There was a significant reduction in total frequency of ST depression post-drug (p less than 0.01). The frequency of asymptomatic ST depression was similarly decreased post-drug (p less than 0.01), and the total magnitude and duration of ST depression were significantly improved post-drug (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These effects of carvedilol lasted for 24 hours after administration. Considering that the heart rate was not excessively reduced during the night, and nocturnal myocardial ischemic episodes were not exacerbated, the mode of action of this drug seems to be based on not only a beta-blocking action but also on a vasodilator action. Carvedilol benefits exertional angina when used in a 20 mg s.i.d. regimen.", 
    "9": "General pharmacological properties of carvedilol (BM 14.190) were investigated in comparison with propranolol. 1. Central nervous system: Carvedilol caused reduction of awareness, motor activity and muscle tone, and staggering gait in Irwin's test (mice). It decreased spontaneous motor activity and potentiated hexobarbital anesthesia (mice). It lacked anticonvulsant activity (mice) and did not have any effect on body temperature (rabbits). Various changes were produced in mono- and polysynaptic spinal reflex (cats). In EEG, a slight arousal pattern was observed (cats). These effects of carvedilol were weaker than those observed after propranolol administration in general. Carvedilol, however, caused potentiation of hexobarbital anesthesia at lower doses than propranolol. Carvedilol inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing syndrome, whereas it failed to show analgesic activity in the tail-pinch test (mice). Propranolol inhibited both pain reactions. 2. Respiratory and cardiovascular system (dogs): Carvedilol increased respiratory rate and decreased expiratory velocity. It produced hypotension and bradycardia. Cardiac contractility was reduced and femoral blood flow was transiently increased after carvedilol administration. Propranolol induced weaker hypotension and greater bradycardia in comparison with carvedilol. It decreased femoral blood flow. 3. Autonomic nervous system: Carvedilol had little or no effects on pupil size, whereas propranolol produced mydriasis (rabbits). Carvedilol inhibited pressor response to norepinephrine (rats), and it also reduced the nictitating membrane contraction induced by pre- and postganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation (cats). Propranolol did not show any inhibitory effect on pressor response to norepinephrine and on the contractile response induced by preganglionic sympathetic nerve stimulation. 4. Smooth muscle: Carvedilol produced inhibitory effects on spontaneous motility, and contractile responses to acetylcholine, histamine, nicotine, serotonin and BaCl2 in isolated ileum (guinea pigs). It also inhibited contractile responses to acetylcholine and histamine in isolated trachea (guinea pigs), and spontaneous motility in isolated uterus (rats). Carvedilol reduced norepinephrine-induced contraction of isolated vas deferens at lower concentration (guinea pigs). 5. Digestive system: Decrease in intestinal motility was observed after intravenous administration of carvedilol and propranolol (rabbits). However, carvedilol failed to influence on gastric motility and tonus, whereas propranolol increased them (rabbits). Carvedilol, like propranolol, induced little or no effects on gastro-intestinal transit (mice) and gastric emptying rate (rats). Both drugs decreased gastric secretion at similar dose (rats). Carvedilol at higher doses produced lesion of gastric mucosa, whereas propranolol did not show these effects (rats). 6. Skeletal muscle: In in vitro experiment, carvedilol, like propranolol, reduced the contractile response of diaphragm to nerve and muscle stimulation (rats)...", 
    "10": "Dopaminergic agonists and antagonists were tested on the field-stimulated mouse vas deferens. Both LY 171555 and SK & F 38393, relatively selective DA2 and DA1 receptor agonists, respectively, produced concentration-dependent inhibition of the field stimulation-induced contractions, without modifying the baseline tone nor the contractile responses to the exogenous noradrenaline. Both LY 171555 and SK & F 38393 concentration-response curves were shifted rightward in a parallel manner by sulpiride (relatively specific DA2 antagonist) and SCH 23390 (relatively specific DA1 antagonist), respectively. The results are suggestive of the existence of pre-junctional dopamine receptors involved in the regulation of sympathetic neurotransmission in rodent vasa.", 
    "11": "The possible involvement of specific dopamine receptors in the relaxing effect of dopamine in the guinea-pig isolated jejunum has been investigated. The relaxing effect of dopamine does not show the tachyphylaxis phenomenon and it is present in preparations from guinea-pigs pretreated with reserpine. These results indicate that dopamine has a direct action. Comparison of the effect of dopamine with those of other dopamine receptor agonists, i.e. apomorphine, bromocriptine and the DA1 selective fenoldopam, were made to calculate potency ratios. Since apomorphine, bromocriptine and fenoldopam were shown to relax the guinea-pig jejunum, partly behaving as indirectly acting agents, comparisons were made on reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs. It has been found that apomorphine is 2.5 times, fenoldopam 3 times and bromocriptine 20 times more active than dopamine in relaxing the guinea-pig jejunum. The order of potency is different from that found in other dopamine receptors containing tissues. The effects of the dopamine receptor blockers, haloperidol and cis-alpha-flupenthixol and the DA1 selective blocker SCH 23390 on the relaxing effect of dopamine were also studied. The relaxing effect of dopamine was not reduced by haloperidol, cis-alpha-flupenthixol and SCH 23390. It is concluded that specific postjunctional dopamine receptors are not involved in the relaxing action of dopamine. Since dopamine is known to interact with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in a variety of tissues, the effects of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine and the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol on the relaxing effect of dopamine were also studied. Noradrenaline has been used to check the responsiveness of the tissue. Phentolamine did not block the responses to dopamine and propranolol was able only to partially reduce responses to dopamine, at concentrations higher than those at which it antagonized noradrenaline. Mechanisms other than dopamine, alpha- or beta-receptor activation should be involved in the relaxing effect of dopamine in the guinea-pig jejunum.", 
    "12": "The method used by McGregor for the isolated mesenteric vascular bed was adapted to study the mechanisms of regulation of cerebral blood flow in the isolated perfused guinea-pig brain. This method allows the recording of the perfusion pressure in the hindbrain perfused at constant physiological flow, and has been successfully applied to the study of the effect of bradykinin. Bradykinin elicited a vasoconstriction that was independent of the presence of the endothelium. The pD2 ranged between 7.50 and 7.60, respectively, with and without the endothelium. Des-Arg9-BK was unable to elicit a vasoconstriction. [Tyr(Me)8]BK had a partial agonist activity. Both [Leu9]des-Arg10-KD and [DArg0,Hyp3,DPhe7]BK had similar antagonist activities. From these pharmacological characteristics, the receptor involved in this response seems to be different from a B1 or a B2 receptor.", 
    "13": "Carvedilol is a new beta-blocking agent with vasodilating activities, which is a racemic mixture of R(+)- and S(-)-enantiomers. Since the two enantiomers differ in pharmacological properties, it is necessary to individually measure their plasma concentrations in order to evaluate the pharmacological effects of racemic carvedilol after oral administration. In this study, a sensitive, stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was used to determine the plasma concentration of each enantiomer. The assay involves the diastereomeric derivatization of racemic carvedilol with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate as a chiral reagent. After oral administration of racemic carvedilol to humans, the mean Cmax and AUC infinity values for R(+)-enantiomer were 2.6 and 2.8 times greater, respectively, than those for the more active S(-)-enantiomer. Similarly, in monkeys, the respective R:S enantiomer ratios for Cmax and AUC infinity were 1.5 and 1.2. The difference in AUCoral between these enantiomers is ascribed to the greater intrinsic clearance of S(-)-enantiomer than that of the R(+)-enantiomer in the liver, and to a lower plasma protein binding of the S(-)-enantiomer.", 
    "14": "Intraocular enzymes convert the ketoxime analogues of some beta-adrenergic blockers via a sequential bioactivation process involving hydrolysis to the corresponding ketones followed by reduction to the aryloxyaminoalcohols, which then exert known and predictable physiological and pharmacological effects only at the site of the action--i.e., in the eye--without any systemic side effects. The sequential nature of the process is highlighted by the observation that the administration of the ketone intermediate also leads to its conversion to the beta-adrenergic antagonist, the active compound. The reduction is stereospecific resulting in the formation of the more potent S-(-)-form of the drug, thus providing prospect to glaucoma treatment. The same activation process of the ketoximes does not take place systemically, thus administration of these ketoximes does not produce cardiovascular effects.", 
    "15": "Adrenergic mechanisms have been widely implicated in the regulation of GnRH secretion in adult rats but their role in young animals, in which the activity of the GnRH neurones is minimal, is unclear. These experiments were done to examine the effects of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation on the secretion in vitro of GnRH by hypothalami from immature and adult male rats. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (10(-9) - 10(-7) M), stimulated release of GnRH from hypothalami from adult (200 g) and peripubertal (150 g) rats but inhibited markedly the secretion of the releasing factor from the limited stores available in hypothalami from immature (50 or 100 g) rats. The stimulatory and inhibitory responses to phenylephrine, evident in adult and younger rats respectively, were concentration-dependent and antagonized readily by the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, alfuzosin (10(-6) M), but not by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (10(-6) M). Hypothalami from 14-day castrated adult rats, in which the serum LH was elevated and hypothalamic GnRH content reduced, responded to alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation in vitro, like those from immature rats, with a marked reduction in GnRH release. In contrast, hypothalami from corresponding castrates bearing testosterone implants, which maintained the hypothalamic GnRH content and serum LH and testosterone concentrations at levels similar to those of intact controls, exhibited the normal 'adult' response to phenylephrine. Studies utilizing 3H-prazosin indicated that the number (Bmax) of hypothalamic alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites increases at puberty but that receptor affinity (KD) is unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "1. The effect of noradrenaline (NA) on the vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in isolated ring segments from the proximal and distal part of the left coronary artery (LCA) in rats was examined. 2. NA had a weak concentration-dependent contractile effect on proximal but relaxed distal segments of the LCA. The maximal NA-induced contraction of the proximal segments was doubled while the relaxation of the distal LCA segments was converted to a contraction after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol 3 x 10(-6) M, thus indicating the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the arteries, with dominance of alpha-adrenoceptors and of beta-adrenoceptors in the proximal and distal segments of the LCA, respectively. 3. The contractile effect of NA (beta-adrenoceptors blocked) was doubled in the proximal LCA segments after the endothelium was removed. Endothelial denudation had, in contrast, no potentiating effect on the contractile response of the distal arteries to NA. Both proximal and distal segments became more sensitive to the contractile action of NA after removal of the endothelium. 4. The spontaneous myogenic tone increased in both proximal and distal LCAs after endothelial removal, indicating spontaneous release of a relaxing endothelial factor in the vessels. 5. Following contraction with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and in the presence of propranolol, 3 x 10(-6) M, and prazosin, 10(-6) M, NA induced an endothelium-dependent relaxation of only proximal but not distal segments of the precontracted LCA. The NA-induced relaxation of the proximal segments of the LCA was not altered by indomethacin 10- M but was completely abolished after incubation with methylene blue, 3 x 10-6 M, or following endothelium removal. These results are compatible with NA-induced release of EDRF in these arteries. 6. The selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, B-HT 933, only induced a weak relaxation of PGF2 alpha,-precontracted proximal (endothelium intact) LCA segments at a concentration of 10-4M. The NA-induced relaxation of these vessels was unaffected by incubating the vessels with 10- IM B-HT 933. The NA relaxation response curve was shifted ca 1.1 log unit to the right by rauwolscine, 1o- 6M, giving an estimated pA2-value of 7.12. The receptor through which NA activates the endothelium appears to be of an atypical alpha 2-subtype.", 
    "17": "Five beta-adrenoceptor blockers, propranolol, acebutolol, diacebutolol, atenolol and bisoprolol, were tested for their antagonistic effect against isoprenaline on human isolated bronchi. The results showed (1) that only propranolol exerted a competitive antagonistic effect against isoprenaline (pA2 = 9.40 +/- 0.22, n = 7) whereas the other drugs did not, and (2) that, in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockers in the plasma concentrations reported after a single usual therapeutic dose, the doses of isoprenaline giving the same bronchodilator effect must be multiplied by 32.6, 5.51, 4.63, 2.82 and 1.95 respectively with propranolol, diacetolol, acebutolol, atenolol, and bisoprolol. It was concluded that (1) atenolol and bisoprolol were the least potent drugs at bronchial level in therapeutic plasma concentrations and (2) that tests performed on the human isolated bronchus might be a useful screening procedure for new drugs with potential activity on the airways.",

Six normal subjects were given single oral doses of betaxolol 10 mg (B10), 20 mg (B20), 40 mg (B40), 80 mg (B80), propranolol 40 mg (P40), or placebo (PL) in a single-blind randomised cross-over design. 2. beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed by reductions in exercise heart rate. Betaxolol produced dose-related reductions in exercise heart rate (beats min-1) up to a ceiling at B40, after which B80 showed a lesser effect: (158 +/- 8 PL, 128 +/- 3 B10, 123 +/- 2 B20, 116 +/- 4 B40, 136 +/- 10 B80, 135 +/- 4 P40). All doses of betaxolol (except B80) produced greater reductions compared with P40: (B10 P less than 0.001, B20 P less than 0.005, B40 P less than 0.001). 3. beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed by attenuation of finger tremor and cardiovascular responses to graded infusions of i.v. isoprenaline. Dose-response curves were constructed and the doses required to increase heart rate by 25 beats min-1, finger tremor by 200%, calf blood flow by 0.5 ml dl-1 min-1, and decrease diastolic blood pressure by 10 mm Hg, after each treatment were calculated.

    "19": "The effectiveness of a single preinduction intravenous (IV) bolus of esmolol in blunting hemodynamic responses to rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation was evaluated. In a randomized double-blind study, 32 ASA I and II healthy patients scheduled for surgery were monitored with electrocardiography (EKG) lead V5, arterial cannulation, and impedance cardiography. After preoxygenation and a priming dose of vecuronium (0.01 mg/kg), patients received either saline (n = 12), esmolol 100 mg (n = 10), or esmolol 200 mg (n = 10) as an IV bolus (20 ml volume). This procedure was immediately followed by a 5 ml IV saline flush, cricoid pressure, thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg, and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg. Patients receiving 200 mg of esmolol had a 50% reduction in the usual tachycardia associated with induction and a greater decline in systolic blood pressure (SP) (by 50%) prior to intubation as compared with the placebo group (p less than 0.05). The increase in diastolic blood pressure (DP) and the reduction in stroke volume (SV) produced by induction and intubation were similar in all the groups. Plasma norepinephrine levels at 1.5 minutes after intubation increased in the esmolol groups about 130% above that measured in the placebo group. This finding was associated with a more gradual return of peripheral resistance to baseline following tracheal intubation. However, both doses of esmolol effectively attenuated heart rate (HR), SP, and rate pressure product (RPP) increases (p less than 0.05 vs placebo) produced by laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.",

Forty-eight ASA II-IV patients were randomized into three equal groups to receive either placebo, esmolol 50 mg, or esmolol 100 mg. Premedication (lorazepam) and anesthetic induction techniques (thiopental sodium and succinylcholine) were identical between groups. Approximately 20 minutes after intubation, during isoflurane/N2O/O2 maintenance anesthesia, patients with systolic pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 110 mmHg were advanced into a 10-minute study drug period if one of two conditions were met: (1) heart rate (HR) was greater than or equal to 95 beats/minute, or (2) an increase in HR of greater than 20% above preinduction baseline occurred. After two consecutive recordings of HR and blood pressure (BP), the study drug (or placebo) was injected. HR was recorded every 30 seconds and BP was recorded every minute during the ensuing 10-minute period. Compared to placebo responses, HR was significantly reduced with both doses of esmolol within 1 minute of bolus injection and remained below placebo levels for 5 minutes after 50 mg of esmolol and for 9.5 minutes after 100 mg of esmolol.

Thirty patients from the Ambulatory Surgery Unit at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center were prospectively randomized to receive a placebo, 100 mg of esmolol, or 200 mg of esmolol immediately prior to induction (2.5 to 3.0 minutes before intubation). The groups were similar in demographic characteristics and with regard to preoperative blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Anesthetic management was standardized for all patients. Esmolol 100 mg (1.4 +/- 0.3 mg/kg) and 200 mg (2.6 +/- 0.7 mg/kg) significantly (p less than 0.05) blunted the maximum increases in HR and BP following intubation. The average maximum HR increase in the placebo group was 40% as opposed to 16% in the esmolol 100 mg group and 14% in the esmolol 200 mg group. Both esmolol groups blunted the tachycardic response over a 4-minute postintubation time period. The average maximum BP increase was 47% in the placebo group versus 22% and 19% in the esmolol 100 mg and esmolol 200 mg groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two esmolol groups.

    "23": "The psychopharmacologic treatment of persons with mental retardation who exhibit aggressive or self-injurious syndromes is varied and controversial. Many psychotropic agents (e.g., antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, and narcotic antagonists) have been used; currently, none of these have been studied sufficiently to recommend them unequivocally, and most have serious potential side effects. A new group of medications, blockers of the beta-adrenergic function of the sympathetic nervous system, have been postulated to have efficacy in some aggressive or self-injurious persons. This literature was reviewed, a relevant case report presented, and concerns raised regarding premature endorsement of beta-blocking medications before they have been adequately studied.", 
    "24": "Although many patients undergoing general anesthesia and surgery are pretreated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, hemodynamic interactions of beta-blockers and volatile anesthetics have so far only been studied in animals. We therefore designed a clinical study to evaluate the relationship between the extent of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the hemodynamic effects of isoflurane anesthesia. Sixty-one patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and normal global left ventricular function scheduled for elective myocardial revascularization were studied immediately prior to surgery. One group of patients (n = 39) had been treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents for at least 3 weeks up to and including the day of surgery. The degree of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min was defined as the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25), representing the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Hemodynamic data were collected before and during isoflurane anesthesia (0.5%-0.6% end-tidal) plus 50% nitrous oxide. Twenty-two patients without preoperative beta-blocker therapy served as a control group. Preanesthetic values of cardiac index (CI), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were lower in patients pretreated with beta-blocking drugs, but statistically these differences were not significant when compared to data obtained in unblocked patients. Isoflurane anesthesia caused significant reductions of CI and arterial blood pressure.

Both responses were blocked by 10(-6) M propranolol but neither response was mimicked by 10(-4) M cAMP. beta-Adrenergic binding studies of individual microdissected proximal tubules using (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 as a hydrophyllic radioligand and (+/-)-timolol (0.1 mM) as the displacer drug revealed two distinct populations of proximal tubules possessing either low (KD = 153.8 nM; Bmax = 110.2 fM/mm) or high affinity (KD = 12.0 nM: Bmax = 3.9 fM/mm) binding characteristics. Competition studies indicated that the bound (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 behaved as a typical beta-adrenergic ligand, being displaced by (-)-isoproterenol but not by (+)-isoproterenol or (-)-phenylephrine.

P/Q plots were constructed by stepwise constriction of the thoracic inferior vena cava to decrease venous return and Q. Compared with conscious dogs, halothane (approximately 1.2% end-tidal) resulted in active, flow-independent pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01) at all levels of Q. Halothane also decreased (P less than 0.01) systemic arterial pressure and Q. Thus our second objective was to determine whether the halothane-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was mediated by reflex neurohumoral activation or by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway. However, the magnitude of halothane-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was not significantly reduced by sympathetic alpha-adrenoreceptor block, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibition, combined arginine vasopressin V1 + V2 receptor block, or by cyclooxygenase inhibition. Finally, halothane-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction (P less than 0.01) was also observed when compared with pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs during controlled ventilation. Thus, compared with the conscious state, halothane anesthesia causes active flow-independent pulmonary vasoconstriction that is not mediated by reflex neurohumoral activation, by metabolites of the cyclooxygenase pathway, nor is it due to the effects of general anesthesia and controlled ventilation.", 
    "27": "The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) exhibits increased cardiovascular reactivity (CVR) to environmental stress and behavioral hyperactivity relative to the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY). This study sought to determine whether enhanced CVR to stress in the SHR is related to hypertension or to behavioral hyperactivity. By breeding SHR with WKY, followed by inbreeding, E. D. Hendley has developed two strains in which the hypertensive trait seems to be separated from the hyperactivity trait: the Wistar-Kyoto hypertensive (WK-HT) and the Wistar-Kyoto hyperactive (WK-HA) strains. Male SHR, WKY, WK-HT, and WK-HA rats were implanted with intravascular catheters and Doppler flow-velocity probes to record arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), and changes in regional vascular resistances. Five days after surgery, the rats were subjected to air-jet stress and pharmacological interventions. The hyperactive strains (SHR and WK-HA) exhibited enhanced pressor, renal, and mesenteric responses to stress, and higher HRs under all conditions, even after autonomic blockade. Both hypertension and hyperactivity were associated with reduced baroreceptor sensitivity. These data indicate that CVR to stress is related to behavioral traits.", 
    "28": "Twenty-five pregnant women with symptomatic mitral valve stenosis (mean valve area, 1.1 +/- 0.25 cm2) were managed by initiation or modification of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with the use of either propranolol or atenolol. Significant improvement of symptoms occurred in 23 patients (92%) (p less than 0.01); the mean maternal heart rate was reduced significantly from 86 +/- 4 to 78 +/- 5 beats/min (p less than 0.0001). The overall fetal heart rate ranged between 130 to 150 beats/min during treatment. Only two patients required urgent closed mitral valvotomy, after pulmonary edema developed as a result of poor compliance to beta-blockade. All patients were safely delivered of infants at term. Fetal heart rates ranged between 120 to 140 beats/min at delivery. There was no maternal or fetal death. Pregnant woman with symptomatic mitral valve stenosis can be safely managed with beta-blockade, giving significant reduction in the incidence of pulmonary edema with no unwanted neonatal side effect.", 
    "29": "To determine the role of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Gs, and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase in the basal metabolism of beta-adrenergic receptors in S49 lymphoma cells, we measured the return of receptor number and function after irreversible blockade of receptors. After inactivation of receptors with the irreversible ligand N8-(bromoacetyl)-N'-[3-(4-indolyoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-(2)-1,8-diam ino-p- methane (BIM), beta-adrenergic receptors (defined as [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites) reappeared in a biphasic manner, the faster phase having a half-time (t 1/2) of 3-8 h (approximately 50% of the sites) and the slower phase greater than 40 h. Although the slow phase is not readily explained, recovery of binding sites during the first 10 h matched recovery of receptor function after BIM treatment (as measured by stimulation of cAMP accumulation) and recovery of receptor sites after downregulation induced by the agonist isoproterenol. Thus quantifying receptor recovery during the first 10 h after BIM treatment appears to be a reasonable method for examining basal receptor metabolism in S49 cells. Measured in this way, metabolism of beta-adrenergic receptors is very similar in wild-type S49 and the following variant clones: cyc- (absent Gs alpha), UNC and H21a (defective Gs alpha), and kin- (lacking cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity). Although previous data have demonstrated that agonist-promoted downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors requires functional receptor-Gs coupling, the current data suggest that neither Gs nor cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity plays an important role in the regulation of basal metabolism of beta-adrenergic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "We examined the effect of prior exposure to somatostatin (SRIH) on its inhibition of GH and TSH responses to GHRH and TRH stimulation to determine whether SRIH desensitization has physiological significance in man. Six men received GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) and TRH (0.3 microgram/kg, iv) 20 min after starting a saline or SRIH (5.5 ng/kg/min, iv) infusion and again 6 h later. Hormone responses were quantified by measuring the area under the curve, corrected for GH concentration at injection time. Similar results were obtained when GH responses were quantified by measuring the hormone secretory rate using the program Detect. Plasma GH and TSH responses to the two GHRH and TRH injections during saline were similar. However, the effects of prior exposure to SRIH were hormone specific. SRIH blunted GH responses to GHRH at 20 min (1609 +/- 286 micrograms/L.min vs. 451 +/- 224), but did not significantly inhibit the responses 6 h later (1422 +/- 410 micrograms/L.min vs. 1000 +/- 302). In contrast, SRIH inhibition of TSH responses to the two TRH injections was similar (first, 946 +/- 201 micrograms/L.min vs. 700 +/- 148; second, 813 +/- 175 micrograms/L.min vs. 562 +/- 66). We next used these results to study whether the previously reported attenuation of GH responses to repeated GHRH stimulation at 2-h intervals is mediated by SRIH. Eight men received GHRH (1 microgram/kg, iv) 380 min after starting a saline or SRIH (5.5 ng/kg/min, iv) infusion or 90 min after starting a primed (5 mg, iv) infusion of propranolol (80 micrograms/min, iv) and again 2 h later. As in the first protocol, GH responses to GHRH were not inhibited when preceded by a 6-h SRIH infusion. However, the 6-h SRIH infusion resulted in a partial restoration of plasma GH responses to the second GHRH injection (saline infusion: first, 1429 +/- 342 micrograms/L.min; second, 254 +/- 75; SRIH infusion: first, 1042 +/- 247 micrograms/L.min; second, 468 +/- 105). beta-Blockade by propranolol resulted in enhanced GH responses to GHRH, but did not prevent the attenuation of GH responses to the second GHRH injection (first, 1937 +/- 366 micrograms/L.min; second, 614 +/- 99). The desensitization to SRIH inhibition of GH responses to GHRH after a 6-h SRIH infusion provides evidence of physiological consequences of SRIH receptor down-regulation. The impaired GH responses to repeated GHRH stimulation are mediated at least in part by enhanced SRIH secretion, which appears independent of a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "31": "Recent experimental and clinical reports have demonstrated that beta-adrenergic blockade impairs and beta-adrenergic stimulation enhances in vivo extrarenal potassium uptake in man. In some allergic patients extrarenal potassium disposal in vivo was reduced compared with normal subjects. In the present study we report that in vitro salbutamol induced potassium uptake by red blood cells may be reduced in some atopic patients. By using a ligand binding assay on cultured human A431 cells, we tried to determine whether in the sera of these atopic subjects there could be anti beta-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies. The results suggest that the observed reduced response to salbutamol of atopics' red blood cells does not depend on autoantibody activity.",

Clinical studies show that gastrointestinal bleeding can be prevented by pharmacologic therapy. This type of treatment is efficient and safe, and, if a drug has no clinical effect, a different drug or a combination can be used. Several problems, however, need to be addressed, including patient compliance, selection of responders, and hemodynamic evaluation of the treatment and its duration. Although pharmacologic treatment of portal hypertension is known to be efficient, there are advances still to be made.", 
    "33": "To study the regulation of islet hormone secretion in exercise-stress, we developed a swimming mouse model. Mice swam for 2, 6, or 10 minutes whereafter blood was sampled for analysis of plasma levels of insulin, glucagon, and glucose. Plasma insulin levels, which were not different from resting controls after 2 or 6 minutes of swimming, were slightly lower after 10 minutes of swimming (P less than .05). Plasma glucagon levels were increased after 2, 6, and 10 minutes of swimming (P less than .001), and plasma glucose levels were lower after 6 and 10 minutes of swimming (P less than .05). Glucose (5.6 mmol/kg)-stimulated insulin secretion was inhibited by 52% +/- 9% by the swimming (P less than .001). The mechanisms behind this inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and the increase in basal plasma glucagon levels induced during 2 minutes of swimming were investigated by the use of autonomic receptor antagonists, administered intraperitoneally 20 minutes before the swimming period. The ganglionic antagonist hexamethonium (56 mumols/kg) prevented the swimming-induced inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, indicating involvement of nerves in the inhibition. Also the nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (6.0 mumols/kg) and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (3.6 mumols/kg) prevented the inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion induced by swimming, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist L-propranolol (9.6 mumols/kg) had no effect. The swimming-induced increase in plasma glucagon levels was partially inhibited by hexamethonium by (58% +/- 24%, P less than .05). Phentolamine and yohimbine totally prevented the increase in plasma glucagon levels, whereas L-propranolol had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In isolated tissues, YM-16151-1 produced a competitive antagonism of CaCl2-induced contraction in the isolated rabbit aorta with a pKca-1 value of 8.17, and also produced a competitive antagonism of isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic responses in the isolated rat atria with a pA2 value of 8.47. In rat brain membrane preparations, YM-16151-1 produced dose-dependent inhibitions of [3H]nitrendipine and [3H]dihydroalprenolol bindings with pKi values of 7.21 and 8.07, respectively. Calcium entry blocking activity of YM-16151-1 was 7 times weaker and 3 times greater than nifedipine and diltiazem, respectively. Beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity of YM-16151-1 was 2 times weaker than that of propranolol. YM-16151-1 showed about 900-fold selectivity for beta-1 adrenoceptor. YM-16151-1 also showed a weak alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity and its potency was about 13 times weaker than that of phentolamine. S-(-)- and R-(+)-isomers of YM-16151-1 showed the same potency of calcium entry blocking activity. However, in beta-1 adrenoceptor blocking activity, the S-(-)-enantiomer was about 13 to 22 times more potent than the R-(+)-enantiomer.

    "35": "Acute treatment with the centrally active beta-2 adrenergic agonist clenbuterol reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate of rats responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 72-sec schedule in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 value of about 0.1 mg/kg). With repeated treatment, rapid tolerance developed to this effect of clenbuterol. Redetermination of the dose-response function for clenbuterol, following 2 weeks of repeated daily administration, showed that clenbuterol no longer affected DRL behavior at doses up to 3 mg/kg. Interestingly, tolerance developed to clenbuterol even when it was administered after each daily session. This suggests that behavioral factors did not contribute, in an appreciable manner, to the development of tolerance to clenbuterol, and that neuropharmacological changes were sufficient for tolerance development. Such an interpretation is supported by the finding that the density of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortices and cerebella of rats receiving the same repeated-treatment regimen was reduced with a time course similar to the loss of behavioral responsiveness. The effects of two additional beta-2 selective agonists, SOM-1122 and zinterol, on DRL behavior also were attenuated after repeated treatment with clenbuterol. By contrast, the effects of the beta-1 selective agonists dobutamine and prenalterol and the antidepressants desipramine, phenelzine and fluoxetine on DRL behavior were unaltered after repeated treatment with clenbuterol. These findings suggest functional independence of the beta adrenergic receptor subtypes and further suggest that, consistent with neuropharmacological data, the behavioral effects of the antidepressants do not depend on functionally responsive beta-2 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "36": "Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of carbachol into the third ventricle of conscious rabbits increased pupil size and intraocular pressure (IOP). A significant increase of pupil size by 0.6-1.3 mm for 60-90 min was observed with the dose of 1 microgram and an increase of IOP by 1.1-1.9 mmHg for 15-60 min was observed with doses over 10 ng. These responses were due to central cholinergic stimulation; mydriasis was eliminated by ICV injection of atropine and the elevation of IOP was significantly reduced by ICV injections of atropine and hexamethonium. Transection of the cervical sympathetic trunk eliminated the mydriasis. The efferent pathway for the mydriasis is via the cervical sympathetic nerve. The elevation of IOP was significantly reduced but not eliminated in the decentralized eye. Plasma epinephrine (Epi) and norepinephrine (NE) increased at 30 min after the ICV injection of 1 microgram carbachol. It is hypothesized that the elevation of IOP is due mainly to the stimulation of ocular sympathetic nerves and the increase of circulating catecholamines. Topical treatment of 0.01% timolol significantly reduced the IOP elevation, indicating the involvement of ocular beta-adrenergic mechanism in the elevation of IOP.", 
    "37": "Contractile responses of bovine retinal microarteries (BRA) (diameter: 198 +/- 5 microns, n = 49) to beta-antagonists, local anesthetics and Ca2(+)-antagonists were studied in vitro. Propranolol (10(-8)-10(-5) M) relaxed K(+)-activated BRA dose-dependently, whereas timolol (10(-8)-10(-5) M) relaxed K(+)-activated BRA only weakly at the highest doses. The relaxation by propranolol was not mediated through interaction with adrenergic nerve endings, since fluorescence histochemistry showed absence of such nerve endings in BRA. In addition, propranolol still relaxed BRA which were treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), which causes chemical adrenergic denervation. Local anesthetic properties of propranolol had no part in the relaxation: lidocaine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) did not relax K(+)-activated BRA. Verapamil (10(-9)-10(-6) M) relaxed K(+)-activated BRA markedly and dose-dependently. Both verapamil and propranolol relaxed phasic K(+)-induced force more than tonic force. By contrast, they relaxed only the tonic part of serotonin-induced force, and they had no effect on stretch-induced active force. Therefore: 1) propranolol dilates BRA more than does timolol, possibly because of the Ca2(+)-antagonistic properties of the former; 2) beta- and Ca2(+)-antagonists probably spare myogenic autoregulation of blood flow and do not prevent, but could partially reverse, serotonin-induced arterial spasm.", 
    "38": "Silent myocardial ischemia (SMI) is a common ischemia process which can be defined as objective evidence of myocardial ischemia without chest pain or other equivalent indications. SMI can occur in totally asymptomatic patients, as well as in patients who have documented coronary artery disease (CAD) and who, on exercise and/or during Holter monitoring, may show ischemic changes. The precise mechanism for pathogenesis and pathophysiology of SMI remains to be clarified. A great deal has been learned about the role of beta-adrenergic receptors, adenylyl cyclase, and guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) in the myocardial ischemic process of SMI. Moreover, standard exercise test and long-term ECG recordings have proved to be of great value, especially when performed jointly, however, in this field there is still room for expanded knowledge. Pharmacological interventions to date have demonstrated the beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists and/or calcium antagonists as contributing substantially to reducing both frequency and duration of SMI episodes. However, therapeutic options to improve the prognosis of SMI appear to be limited.",

We also studied the effects of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine (3 mg/kg), prazosin (25-500 micrograms/kg), yohimbine (10-500 micrograms/kg), WB 4101 (2 mg/kg), and benoxathian (2 mg/kg) during decentralized LAS. EAD amplitude, presented as a percentage of monophasic action potential amplitude, was recorded simultaneously with contact electrodes from the right and left ventricular endocardium. Phenylephrine and LAS plus propranolol increased EAD amplitude (31.5 +/- 8.8% to 47.8 +/- 9.7% and 34.8 +/- 4.1% to 46.1 +/- 6.4%, respectively) and the prevalence of VT (from three to nine of 11 dogs and from the three to five of six dogs, respectively). Prazosin produced a dose-response decrease in EAD amplitude and reduced the prevalence of VT. Yohimbine did not alter the amplitude of EADs or the prevalence of VT. WB 4101 and phentolamine reduced the amplitude of EADs produced by cesium and LAS (from 44.3 +/- 10.2% to 32.6 +/- 9.4% and from 39.8 +/- 6.9% to 30.3 +/- 6.3%, respectively) and the prevalence of VT (from eight to one of 10 dogs and from 13 to 5 of 20 dogs, respectively).

    "41": "Pulmonary reactivity to methacholine after equipotent beta-blocking doses of propranolol and esmolol was compared in seven basenji-greyhound dogs during thiopental-fentanyl anesthesia. Equipotent doses of esmolol and propranolol were determined by both heart rate effects and by isoproterenol response curves. Propranolol (2 mg/kg) was administered intravenously as a bolus dose and esmolol (0.4-0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) was administered by continuous infusion. Both esmolol and propranolol significantly decreased heart rate and mean arterial pressure (P less than 0.001). Baseline pulmonary resistance and dynamic compliance did not change after the administration of either propranolol or esmolol. However, propranolol significantly shifted the methacholine dose-response curve to the left so that methacholine (0.3 mg/ml) increased pulmonary resistance by 7.9 +/- 0.97 cmH2O.l-1.s-1 (mean +/- SEM of seven dogs) after pretreatment with propranolol but only 4.4 +/- 0.89 cmH2O.l-1.s-1 (P less than 0.05) without propranolol pretreatment (control). Esmolol, however, did not significantly shift the methacholine dose-response curve. Methacholine (0.3 mg/ml) increased resistance 4.0 +/- 0.89 cmH2O.l-1.s-1 during esmolol administration. This study shows that at equipotent beta 1-blocking doses, propranolol, but not esmolol, produces significant increases in pulmonary reactivity to methacholine.", 
    "42": "Intravenous medroxalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, causes an immediate hypotensive effect. In 14 subjects with mild-to-moderate hypertension, cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) were significantly decreased without significant changes in stroke volume, reflecting the fact that a reduced CO and CI were related to decreases in heart rate. The vasodilator effect of intravenous medroxalol was not apparent with the dosages used in this study. Transient changes noted in two Doppler diastolic velocity indexes--mitral early diastolic peak flow velocity (PFVE) and the ratio of mitral late-to-early diastolic peak flow velocity (PFVA/E)--are suggestive of an improvement in left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling during medroxalol infusion, possibly related to changes in loading conditions. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not correlate with any of the Doppler diastolic and systolic indexes in our patient population. Reduced aortic peak flow velocity, rate of aortic flow acceleration, and the rate of mitral early diastolic deceleration were noted with increasing LV mass index, independent of age or blood pressure. Doppler echocardiography may be a useful tool in the assessment and follow-up of LV systolic and diastolic function in patients undergoing pharmacologic interventions.", 
    "43": "Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells (MELC). Commitment, the irreversible initiation of the program of terminal-cell differentiation, is first detected in HMBA-sensitive DS19-SC9 MELC in culture after 10 to 12 h of exposure to HMBA. Vincristine (VC)-resistant MELC derived from the DS19-SC9 MELC line display increased sensitivity to HMBA and become committed with little or no latent period. In the present study, we showed that the MELC line R1, which is resistant to HMBA-mediated differentiation, became sensitive to inducer if selected for a low level of VC resistance (less than 10 ng of VC per ml). Four independently derived VC-resistant cell lines from HMBA-resistant R1 cells, designated R1[VCR]a to R1[VCR]d, acquired sensitivity to HMBA and the accelerated kinetics of commitment that are characteristic of VC-resistant MELC derived from the parental DS19-SC9 cells. The calcium channel blocker verapamil suppresses the VC resistance of R1[VCR] cells but does not alter the accelerated response to HMBA. In R1[VCR] cells there was no detectable increase in the level of the 140-kilodalton P-glycoprotein. Transient inhibition of protein synthesis during the latent period delays inducer-mediated commitment of VC-sensitive DS19-SC9 MELC but does not alter the accelerated commitment kinetics of R1[VCR]a cells. Previously, we have reported evidence that protein kinase C beta (PKC beta) plays a role in HMBA-induced MELC differentiation and that compared with DS19-SC9 cells, R1 cells have a relatively low level and R1[VCR]a cells have a high level of PKC beta. These findings suggest that (i) acquisition of VC resistance overcomes the block acquired by R1 cells to HMBA-mediated differentiation; (ii) the accelerated kinetics of HMBA-induced commitment of VC-resistant MELC is not dependent on the verapamil-sensitive transport channel that is responsible, at least in part, for resistance to VC; (iii) in VC-resistant MELC, there is constitutive expression or accumulation of a protein required for HMBA-induced differentiation; and (iv) an elevated level of PKC beta activity may play a role in the altered response of R1[VCR] and other VC-resistant MELC to HMBA.", 
    "44": "The hydrophilic beta-adrenoceptor ligand (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 binds to intact C6 cells with a high affinity (KD approximately 0.1 nM) and with a high degree of specificity. The binding was inhibited by DL-propranolol (Ki approximately 1 nM). Treatment of cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) without fetal calf serum for 4 days with desipramine reduced the (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 specific binding in a concentration-dependent manner, a reduction from 127 to 102 fmol/mg of protein being found at a ligand concentration of 1 nM after treatment with 10 microM desipramine. Lesser effects were seen after treatment for 1 day. A similar result was found with maprotiline, and reductions in specific binding were seen after 4 days of treatment with amitriptyline, iprindole, and citalopram. The reduction in binding-site density (measured per milligram of protein to compensate for variability in cell density per well), however, was paralleled in all cases by a reduction in the rate of cell proliferation. When C6 glioma cells were cultured in Ham's medium without fetal calf serum during the antidepressant treatment period, a higher specific binding was observed than for the DMEM-cultured cells, and 10 microM desipramine was without effect on either the (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 specific binding or cell proliferation. It is concluded that the effects of the antidepressants tested upon the density of (-)-[3H]CGP-12177 specific binding sites in intact C6 cells may be secondary to the toxicity of the compounds under the conditions used.",

    "46": "The effect of the antihypertensive drug IP66 on dopamine-induced vasodilatation has been investigated in isolated perfused rat mesenteric bed. Experiments were carried out in phenoxybenzamine-pretreated preparations to avoid the involvement of alpha-adrenoceptors. Dopamine (1-100 microM) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation of high-K(+)-induced vasoconstriction, which was resistant to propranolol (3 microM), but antagonized by the DA1-receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.1 microM). However, the dopamine-vasodilating component resistant to SCH 23390 (0.1 microM) could be abolished by simultaneous administration of propranolol. Thus, dopamine-induced vasodilatation is mainly ascribable to stimulation of DA1-receptors, although an action on beta 2-adrenoceptors might contribute as well. In presence of IP66 (10 nM), dopamine-induced vasodilatation was significantly enhanced. This amplifying activity was not observed with prazosin and it was blocked by propranolol (3 microM) but unaffected by SCH 23390 (0.1 microM) or by chemical sympathectomy. Furthermore, IP66 (10 nM) also increased, in a significant manner, the amplitude of vasodilatation elicited by the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline, both in rat mesenteric bed and in rat aortic strips. In rat aortic membranes, IP66 (10 nM) enhanced the stimulatory effect of terbutaline (1 microM) on adenylate cyclase activity. In conclusion, IP66 is able to enhance the vasodilatation of rat mesenteric vasculature induced by dopamine or terbutaline. It is proposed that this action might be consequent to an increase in efficiency of the coupling between beta 2-adrenoceptors and membrane adenylate cyclase.",

In some cells, during galanin inhibition there was a hyperpolarization after the spike. Verapamil (30, 60 and 90 mumol/L), a blocker of voltage-dependent Ca channels, blocked dose-dependently the electrical activity induced by glucose and attenuated the depolarization induced by KCl 50 mmol/L. Galanin 0.3 mumol/L also attenuated the depolarization induced by KCl 50 mmol/L, similar to the effect of verapamil. The results suggest that the effect of galanin on inhibition of the electrical activity of beta cell might be due to blocking of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.", 
    "49": "A continuous exposition to antigen provokes an increase of IgE synthesis in individuals sensitized to that antigen. This increase in the synthesis is hardly seen to be reflected in seric levels; however, it is clearly seen in the quantity of IgE associated with membranes as this value increases considerably. This fact is due to the characteristic of IgE which tends to fix itself to basophil membrane. On the other hand, although no difference exists in basal adenyl cyclase activity of asthmatic and healthy individuals, the sensitivity of this enzyme to isoproterenol (beta-agonist) is greater in healthy than in asthmatic individuals. The antigenic stimulus makes adenyl cyclase activity descend in these individuals; this does not happen when the cells are treated with ketotifen before stimulating them with the antigen.", 
    "50": "Effects of arotinolol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, on regional myocardial dysfunction produced by severe coronary stenosis in anesthetized dogs were examined and compared with those of labetalol and propranolol. Doses of these three antagonists were selected to produce a comparable degree of the negative chrono- and inotropic effect but a different potency of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade (labetalol greater than arotinolol). Regional myocardial function measured as segment shortening (%SS) was decreased to around 2-3% by constriction of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX), and then drug or saline was administered i.v. The stenosis of LCX was released 30 min after the administration. No significant alteration in hemodynamic and contractility parameters was seen as compared to the predrug value up to at least 30 min after saline i.v. Arotinolol and propranolol both reduced heart rate and peak positive left ventricular dP/dt (LVdP/dt) without a significant change in LCX flow. Concomitantly, %SS distal to a coronary stenosis was significantly improved by arotinolol and propranolol. On the other hand, labetalol significantly reduced LCX flow probably due to systemic hypotension and failed to improve %SS in the ischemic area, although the agent markedly decreased heart rate and LVdP/dt. These results indicate that arotinolol improves impaired regional myocardial function distal to a coronary stenosis in a similar manner with propranolol.", 
    "51": "In a placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study, 16 patients (10 males, 6 females; 50.6 +/- 10.4 years; body weight of 74.5 +/- 8.9 kg; mean +/- SD) with arterial hypertension (WHO stages I and II) were administered single oral doses of placebo, 80 mg of propranolol, as well as 50 and 100 mg of brefanolol (a beta-adrenergic blocking agent with vasodilating properties) in order to determine the resulting hemodynamic effects. Blood pressure, heart rate, and various hemodynamic parameters were assessed noninvasively by mechano- and impedance cardiography as well as by venous occlusion plethysmography before and 2, 4, 6, 10, and 24 h after drug administration. Treatment with propranolol resulted in the typical hemodynamic changes induced by a beta-adrenergic blocking agent characterized by a significant reduction in blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and an increase in total peripheral resistance. A dose of 100 mg of brefanolol also led to comparable hemodynamic effects. Similar significant decreases in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output also occurred with 50 mg of brefanolol, but stroke volume and reactive hyperemia increased. Thus, in this phase of drug development, dose titration with 50 and 100 mg of brefanolol indicates that the lower dose gives rise to a more balanced relationship between its beta-adrenergic blocking and vasodilating properties.", 
    "52": "The effects on exercise tolerance of 7-day treatment with a calcium channel blocker, verapamil 160 mg twice daily (b.i.d.), and a beta 1-selective blocker, atenolol 50 mg b.i.d., were compared in 10 healthy and physically active young subjects in 5,000-m cross-country running at high intensity. The study was a double-blind cross-over trial. Comparison was made with a single-blind placebo as well. Performance time was measured every 1,000 m in seven 5,000-m runs, in which subjects were instructed to keep to a constant fatigue perception (Borg scale rating). Both drugs significantly (p = 0.001) increased the performance time over the first 1,000 m as compared with placebo. However, running time after 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 m was prolonged significantly less (p less than 0.05) by verapamil than by atenolol. For the entire 5,000-m run, atenolol caused a significant increase (p = 0.001) in mean running time by 1 min 34 s (i.e., 7.5%; 95% confidence interval 48 s to 2 min 21 s) as compared with placebo, whereas verapamil caused no significant change (+46 s).", 
    "53": "The beta-blocking activities of a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, carvedilol, evaluated in isolated atria and trachea of the guinea pig were 2.0 (beta 1) and 3.2 times (beta 2), respectively, as potent as those of propranolol. Carvedilol exhibited the alpha-blocking activities in the aorta of guinea pigs and rats. Carvedilol was 2 and 50 times less potent in guinea pigs and rats, respectively, than prazosin as an alpha-blocker. Thus, the alpha-blocking activities were twice as potent as the beta-blocking activity in the rat and one-fifth that of the beta-blocking activity in the guinea pig. In anesthetized open-chest dogs, the beta-blocking activity of carvedilol was 1.5 times more potent than that of propranolol and had 3.8 times the alpha-blocking activity. Thus, carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocking drug with a potent alpha-blocking activity. Carvedilol and propranolol showed dose-dependent and significant decreases in the blood pressure, total cardiac output, left ventricular pressure, dp/dt, heart rate, coronary flow, and oxygen consumption in anesthetized open-chest dogs. Carvedilol decreased the total peripheral resistance significantly (the decrease was not proportional to the decreases in the blood pressure at high doses), while propranolol increased it significantly and dose-dependently. These results indicate the importance of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity in the decrease in blood pressure produced by carvedilol.", 
    "54": "We examined the effects of the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 in the isolated heart and defined interactions of endothelin-1 with other hormone systems. Isolated isovolumic rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at constant pressure. First, the effect of a single bolus of endothelin-1 (4-400 pmol) was followed for 90 min. The effect of high dosages (40 and 400 pmol) of endothelin-1 on coronary flow was biphasic, with an early vasodilator and a late vasoconstrictor component that was irreversible. Second, cumulative dose-response curves were obtained for endothelin-1 boluses of 0.04-400 pmol. Coronary flow declined with increasing dosages and was almost abolished at 400 pmol. Neither alpha- nor beta-blocking agents (phentolamine and propranolol) nor the Ca2(+)-channel blocker nifedipine altered the effects of endothelin-1, but prostaglandin synthesis inhibition by indomethacin significantly augmented vasoconstriction by endothelin-1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition by captopril antagonized endothelin-1-dependent vasoconstriction to a small extent at 400 pmol. Coronary constriction due to endothelin-1 could not be reversed by nitroglycerin. We conclude that in isolated rat heart endothelin-1 causes marked and long-lasting coronary constriction. The effect is not influenced by sympathetic and Ca2(+)-channel blockade, is enhanced by prostaglandin synthesis inhibition, and is reduced by ACE inhibition.", 
    "55": "Responses of the basilar artery and aorta to vasoactive agents in alloxan-induced diabetic and age-matched control rabbits were examined. There were no significant differences in the reactivity of the basilar artery to norepinephrine (NE), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and K+ between age-matched control and diabetic rabbits. The maximal contraction of the aorta with endothelium in response to NE was significantly enhanced in the case of the aorta from diabetic rabbits. Pretreatment with 10(-6) M methylene blue or removal of the endothelium enhanced the contractile response of aorta to NE from control rabbits and, after such treatment, the concentration-response curve to NE was almost identical to that of aorta from diabetic rabbits. Basal levels of cyclic GMP but not cyclic AMP in the diabetic aorta with endothelium were significantly lower than those in the control aorta with endothelium. These results demonstrate that the cerebral artery is resistant to diabetes mellitus within 10 weeks as compared with the peripheral artery. The enhancement in the contractile response of aorta to NE in diabetic rabbits is due to the attenuation of the spontaneous release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, through an impairment of the function of endothelial cells.", 
    "56": "Premature escape beats induced in conscious dogs with chronic complete atrioventricular block have been defined as escape beats occurring on cessation of overdrive pacing and having a coupling interval to the last paced beat shorter than the coupling interval between the premature escape beat and the second postpacing beat. Triggered activity has been proposed as the primary underlying mechanism. We used standard microelectrode techniques to study the effects of overdrive pacing on normal automatic canine Purkinje fibers to determine if premature escape beats could be induced and if so, to define the underlying cellular mechanism(s). For this purpose, we overdrive-paced Purkinje fibers for 10 and 50 seconds and for 10 and 50 beats at a pacing cycle length (PCL) of 1,000-200 msec. In addition, to help distinguish among major arrhythmogenic mechanisms, we used a matrix of drugs consisting of propranolol, nadolol, lidocaine, ethmozin, and doxorubicin. Fifty-second stimulation trains induced \"classic\" overdrive suppression of the first three postpacing impulses, whereas 10-second overdrive pacing induced significant overdrive suppression only at a PCL of 200 msec. With 50-beat overdrive pacing and a PCL of 1,000-600 msec, there was overdrive suppression of postpacing impulses, whereas reduced overdrive suppression was observed at a PCL of 400-200 msec. Ten-beat stimulation trains induced a \"flat response\" of postpacing impulses. Ten- and 50-beat overdrive pacing provoked premature escape beats in 66% of the fibers, with the higher incidence at a PCL of 200 msec for 50-beat stimulation trains. No shortening of the coupling interval of premature escape beats was observed at faster pacing rates. Only lidocaine (which suppresses normal automaticity) abolished premature escape beats. We conclude that normal automaticity is the most likely mechanism underlying premature escape beats in Purkinje fibers with high levels of membrane potential.", 
    "57": "The effects of mental stress (a colour word conflict test, CWT) and adrenaline infusions (0.1 and 0.4 nmol kg-1 min-1) on t-PA activity, t-PA antigen, PAI-1 activity and PAI-1 antigen were studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Furthermore, the effects of metoprolol (200 mg/day during 1 week) or placebo (double-blind cross-over study) on fibrinolytic responses to sympatho-adrenal activation, and relationships between fibrinolysis and blood lipids were investigated. Low and high dose adrenaline infusions yielding plasma adrenaline levels of 0.9 +/- 0.1 and 3.4 +/- 0.4 nmol/l, respectively, dose-dependently increased t-PA levels with a concomitant decrease in PAI-1 levels. A similar, but weaker, fibrinolytic response seemed to occur during CWT, when plasma adrenaline levels were only moderately increased (to 0.4 +/- 0.1 nmol/l). Metoprolol treatment did not influence the resting levels of the fibrinolytic variables studied, but tended to enhance the t-PA response to CWT and further reduce PAI-1 during adrenaline infusion. Metoprolol treatment was not accompanied by any rise in PAI-1 levels despite drug induced elevations of triglyceride levels. Thus, the present study shows that sympatho-adrenal activation increases fibrinolytic activity in vivo and that metoprolol treatment may have a favourable influence on this activity.", 
    "58": "In vivo, astroglial cells are closely interrelated with neurons. The present studies were undertaken to determine if certain astroglial properties are influenced when maintained in a heterogeneous cellular environment. Astrocytes and neurons were co-cultured from hippocampal tissue and the parameters examined included astroglial morphology and expression of beta- and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (AR). Astroglial cells exhibit an extremely elongated morphology when growing in direct contact with neurons. Astroglia growing under the same culture conditions, but not in direct contact with neurons, exhibited a polygonal morphology. One hundred percent of the elongated astroglia expressed the beta-AR with an average density of 1320 binding sites/1000 microns 2. In contrast, only 40-50% of these elongated astroglia expressed alpha 1-ARs. Our results indicate that astroglia, maintained in the presence of neurons, continue to express beta- and alpha 1-ARs. These results suggest that under in vivo conditions, where astroglia normally exist in close contact with neurons, astrocytes may express surface receptors which enable them to sense neuronal activity and to selectively respond to such activity. The elongated astroglia described here may exhibit morphological features more reminiscent to that which exists in vivo.", 
    "59": "The aim of this study was to investigate the cardiovascular effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), flesinoxan and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) following injection into the dorsal raphe nucleus of conscious rats. 8-OH-DPAT (0.5-2.5 micrograms), hypotension, bradycardia and flat body posture. In contrast, injection of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 microgram) into the median raphe nucleus caused no cardiovascular changes or flat body posture. (-)Pindolol (0.5 microgram dorsal raphe nucleus) had little effect on cardiovascular parameters, but significantly attenuated the cardiovascular effects of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 microgram dorsal raphe nucleus). N-Methylatropine (1 mg/kg i.v.) antagonised the cardiovascular effects of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 microgram dorsal raphe nucleus), suggesting these were vagally mediated. Both pretreatments also appeared to reduce 8-OH-DPAT-induced flat body posture. The results suggest that 8-OH-DPAT activates 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus to cause hypotension and bradycardia.", 
    "60": "Propranolol and the sodium-channel-blocking antiarrhythmic agent propafenone share structural features. Although propafenone's beta-blocking actions are readily demonstrable in vitro, clinically significant beta-blockade occurs inconsistently in vivo. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that genetically determined variations in the biotransformation of propafenone to its 5-hydroxy metabolite account for variations in the drug's beta-blocking action. We assessed beta-blockade by measuring the reduction in tachycardia produced by boluses of isoproterenol and treadmill exercise in 14 normal subjects during treatment with placebo and with 150, 225, and 300 mg of propafenone every eight hours for five days each. Nine subjects (with the extensive-metabolizer phenotype) metabolized most of the propafenone to 5-hydroxy propafenone, and five (with the poor-metabolizer phenotype) did not produce this metabolite. At the lower dosages, beta-blockade was present in both groups but was significantly greater in the subjects with poor metabolism, in whom deficient 5-hydroxylation was associated with higher plasma propafenone levels. At the highest dose, a similar degree of beta-blockade was observed in the two groups. Propafenone also had a higher affinity for beta 2 receptors in vitro than either of its major metabolites. We conclude that the degree of beta-blockade during propafenone therapy reflects genetically determined variations in the metabolism of the parent drug, which is necessary for beta-blockade, and that this action of propafenone is considerably enhanced in patients with deficient 5-hydroxylation of propafenone.", 
    "61": "The addition of enalapril or acebutolol to a regimen of altizide + spironolactone in patients with moderate hypotension was investigated in a multicenter study of 53 patients. The patients underwent semiambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring, especially to observe hypotensive episodes. In the 25 patients uncontrolled with altizide + spironolactone alone, enalapril and acebutolol were about equally effective in reducing blood pressure. The incidence of hypotension was low and comparable for both treatment groups, provided that the initial dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was low (5 mg).", 
    "62": "Arterial elasticity, which can be assessed by means of a piezogram, is thought to be involved in the development of hypertension. In hypertensive patients (and with aging in normal subjects), arterial elasticity is reduced. Long-term administration of spironolactone, beta blockers, or a beta-blocker/dihydralazine combination to hypertensive patients sufficiently reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure to about the same extent; however, only spironolactone had any effect on piezoelectric indexes of arterial elasticity.", 
    "63": "A multicenter study was performed in 919 hypertensive patients, 780 of whom could be evaluated.

The other 298 patients (group II) were treated with 1 or 2 tablets per day of Aldactazine plus a conventional antihypertensive agent, e.g., a beta blocker, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine. After 45 days of treatment with Aldactazine alone, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) decreased by 15 and 14%, respectively, vs baseline values. The addition of the other antihypertensive agent decreased BP further; however, the best results were obtained with the combination of Aldactazine and clonidine. With this combination, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 16.6 and 18%, respectively, vs baseline. In terms of adverse effects, a few cases of gastrointestinal disturbances and orthostatic hypotension were reported.", 
    "64": "In a 65-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes there was an increase in the severity and frequency of hypoglycemic attacks during treatment with ophthalmic timolol maleate for glaucoma. When timolol was stopped hypoglycemic attacks ceased. While recurrent exacerbation of hypoglycemia and its symptoms in insulin-dependent diabetics is a relatively common side-effect of systemic beta-blockers, there are scarcely any reports attributing this phenomenon to topical ophthalmic beta-blockers. Topical as well as systemic beta-blocking agents must be used with great caution in diabetics receiving insulin.", 
    "65": "Reciprocal interaction between beta-adrenoceptor specific ligand occupancy and alloantibody binding to specific antigens of cardiac and smooth muscle tissues was observed. Interference of alloimmune antibody fixation to both cardiac and oviductal tract preparations by beta 1 or beta 2 selective blockers, respectively, was obtained by means of indirect immunofluorescence assays. Reciprocally, alloimmune IgG and monoclonal antibodies directed to class I H-2 antigens, behaving as beta-adrenoceptor agonists, modified the contractility of both tissues, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Additionally, alloantibodies were also capable of inhibiting specific beta-adrenoceptor radioligand binding to purified cardiac and smooth muscle membranes. These data suggested a modulation of beta-adrenoceptor function by antibodies directed against H-2 class I histocompatibility molecules, probably through molecular interactions between both structures.", 
    "66": "In 25 hypertensives (42 +/- years), predominantly at stage I according to WHO-criteria, by the application of daily 5 +/- 4 mg prazosine and as combination of 9 +/- 6 mg with 73 +/- 31 mg propranolol the blood pressure normalized itself from on an average 183 to 148 mgHg systolically and 113 to 93 mgHg diastolically. In a long-term experiment confirmable also echocardiographically prazosine alone decreased the afterload of the heart in an unchanged high energy requirement at rest, and in a submaximal ergostasis the aerobic metabolic situation deteriorated. This could again be balanced by the combination with propranolol, whereby oxygen pulse, product of the pressure frequency and PWC 130 even improved. Function and size of the left ventricle remained echocardiographically uninfluenced in the two forms of therapy.", 
    "67": "The effect of aging on some of the properties of the beta-adrenergic transduction system was determined in a membrane fraction of spleen mononuclear leukocytes from young (2-3 months) and old (24-25 months) rats. Receptor density was unchanged and the percentage of receptors in the high affinity configuration for isoproterenol was reduced with increasing age. Adenylate cyclase activity, either unstimulated or stimulated with forskolin, GTP or isoproterenol was not affected by aging. This suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms in the beta-adrenergic signal transduction system of rat spleen mononuclear cells in order to ensure equal cAMP production for equal agonist stimulation.",

After cocaine administration, arterial pressure and rate-pressure product increased; coronary sinus blood flow fell (139 +/- 28 [mean +/- SE] to 120 +/- 20 mL/min); coronary vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure divided by coronary sinus blood flow) rose (0.87 +/- 0.10 to 1.05 +/- 0.10 mm Hg/mL.min); and coronary arterial diameters decreased by between 6% and 9% (P less than 0.05 for all variables). Subsequently, intracoronary propranolol administration caused no change in arterial pressure or rate-pressure product but further decreased coronary sinus blood flow (to 100 +/- 14 mL/min) and increased coronary vascular resistance (to 1.20 +/- 0.12 mm Hg/mL.min) (P less than 0.05 for both).",

    "75": "To study the effect of selective alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenergic blockade on the myocardial contractile and chronotropic response to exercise, 29 dogs were chronically instrumented with a sonomicrometer for measuring myocardial wall thickness and a micromanometer for measuring left ventricular pressure. During treadmill exercise, either the selective alpha 1-blocker prazosin (80 micrograms/kg, n = 12) or the alpha 2-blocker idazoxan (80 micrograms/kg, n = 8) was infused into the left atrium beginning 2-3 minutes after the onset of exercise. alpha 1-Adrenoceptor blockade, like alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade, was found to cause significant increases in systolic wall thickening, thickening velocity, heart rate, and left ventricular contractility, indicating an increase in inotropic state that was comparable to that with alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade. Preventing the decrease in aortic blood pressure after selective alpha 1-blockade by using either systemic angiotensin II infusion (n = 6) or inflation of an intra-aortic balloon (n = 6) did not prevent the observed increases in wall thickening, heart rate, and left ventricular contractility. In four of the dogs treated with prazosin, the norepinephrine concentration in the coronary sinus was found to more than double after alpha 1-blockade. beta-Adrenergic blockade (propranolol, 1.0 mg/kg) prevented the increased contractile and chronotropic state caused by alpha 1- or alpha 2-blockade. Selective alpha-adrenergic blockade during adrenergic activation by intravenous norepinephrine infusion, in contrast to exercise, had no effect on wall thickening, heart rate, or left ventricular contractility. These data indicate that selective alpha 1-adrenergic blockade, like selective alpha 2-adrenergic blockade, causes a significant augmentation of heart rate and left ventricular contractility in the dog during dynamic exercise. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that this occurs through a presynaptic disinhibition of neural norepinephrine release mediated by a prejunctional alpha 1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "76": "The authors tested in an open, uncontrolled trial in a group of 23 patients with essential hypertension grade I-II (WHO classification) the effect of Metoprolol OROS. The OROS system is a new form of Metoprolol administration which makes it possible to maintain by a single dose per day a steady plasma concentration, while preserving the cardioselectivity and total 24-hour effectiveness during treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. After eight weeks of Metoprolol OROS administration, in doses gradually adjusted to the therapeutic action, gradually a significant decrease of the heart rate (HR) occurred, of the systolic blood pressure (BPs) and diastolic blood pressure (BPd) (p less than 0.01 for all values) in a recumbent as well as upright position. A reduction of the BPd in an upright position by greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg was achieved in 85% of the patients, in 73.9% of the patients the BPd in an upright position dropped below 95 mm Hg. Four patients developed side-effects which were mild to medium severe (vertigo, palpitations, fatigue, sensation of tremor, tension in the lower extremities). Two patients discontinued treatment early, the main reason in both being palpitations which were under better conversely, in two patients palpitations which were not adequately controlled by previous metoprolol treatment, disappeared completely during Metoprolol OROS treatment. During the trial no significant changes in the investigated laboratory values incl. total cholesterol were recorded, Metoprolol OROS administered once per day is an effective, safe and well tolerated preparation in treatment of mild to medium severe essential hypertension.", 
    "77": "In this study the effect of l-nebivolol on the blood pressure lowering action of d-nebivolol was investigated after intraperitoneal administration of the drugs to spontaneously hypertensive rats. Doses of l-nebivolol which did not affect blood pressure when given alone potentiated the decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure induced by 1.25 mg.kg-1 d-nebivolol. The potentiating effect of l-nebivolol was seen at doses higher than 0.16 mg.kg-1. At 1.25 mg.kg-1 d-nebivolol significantly reduced the heart rate, an effect which was not potentiated by l-nebivolol in doses up to 1.25 mg.kg-1. Higher doses of l-nebivolol (2.5 and 5.0 mg.kg-1) in combination with 1.25 mg.kg-1 d-nebivolol not only lowered the blood pressure further, but also significantly reduced the heart rate; thus at these doses the enantiomers together exerted more pronounced beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties. This is probably disadvantageous, because d,l-nebivolol has been shown to decrease arterial blood pressure in hypertensive patients and animals before it reaches its maximal beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking effect. Therefore, the racemic mixture of 50% d-nebivolol and 50% l-nebivolol seems to contain the two compounds in near optimal proportions for an antihypertensive effect.", 
    "78": "A novel phospholipase C specific for phosphatidylcholine has been shown to be activated by several agonists. Also, recent evidence suggests that transformation mediated by the ras oncogene possibly involves the activation of this novel phospholipid degradative pathway which would account for the increased diacylglycerol levels associated with transformation. Here we use a mutant of Ki-ras which is temperature-sensitive for transformation to investigate the kinetics of activation of the phosphodiesterase-mediated turnover of phosphatidylcholine. Upon shift to the permissive temperature, products of the activated phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C were detected by 30 min and reached maximal levels by 1-2 h. These results suggest that the product of the ras oncogene rapidly activates the phosphodiesteratic hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, the fact that at least 4 h are required for serum to activate this phospholipase C strongly suggests that the ras oncogene product might be involved in late steps of the mitogenic signaling cascade.",

Propranolol was given in a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg b.w. intravenously. Lidocaine was injected in a single dose of 3 mg/kg b.w. during 5 minutes i.v. after a 30-minute interval. All drugs were injected into ear vein. Blood for assays was collected 8 times within 6 hours after lidocaine administration. TDx system manufactured by Abbott was used for drug concentration assay with immunofluorescence polarization method. One-compartment open model was used for calculations. The results were analysed with Student t-test for pairs. Significant decrease in AUC, marked decrease in distribution volume and total body clearance following lidocaine and propranolol were noted. The study has shown that there is interaction between propranolol and lidocaine leading to a decrease in total body lidocaine clearance.",

Among our 27 newly diagnosed glaucoma patients no pressure rise or iritic reaction was detected. More than 50% of the patients were still managed with an intraocular pressure below 21 mmHg without medical or surgical treatment after 2 years.

    "83": "To avoid repeated production of 125I tissue mash standards and to decrease inter-experiment variability, a set of commercially available, high activity plastic 3H standards was calibrated for use with 125I autoradiographs. Standards with a range of 2.0-7390 microCi 3H/g plastic were used since they produced autoradiographs of suitable optical density (darkness) at exposure times of 4 to more than 72 h. Tissue mash standards at 12 concentrations of 125I were produced by homogenizing rat brains and adding 125I. These were frozen and sectioned at thicknesses ranging from 6 to 120 microns and mounted on microscope slides. Each set of tissue standards, along with slides bearing the plastic 3H standards, was opposed to film for various times. The calibration of the 3H standards was done separately for each time point and section thickness. Autoradiographs were analyzed using a computer assisted image analysis system. The standard curve generated for each set of 125I-labelled tissue standards was correlated with the 3H standards. It was found that the relationship between the 3H plastic standards and the 125I tissue mash standards was not simple and depended on exposure time, thickness of the section, as well as the concentration of radioactivity in a given standard. However, this accurate calibration of the 3H standards yields long-lived standards for 125I autoradiography useful over a wide range of radionuclide concentrations, tissue thicknesses and exposure times.", 
    "84": "Using the cannula inserting method, we investigated the vascular responses to norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine and isoprenaline (Isp) in isolated, perfused simian facial veins. NE usually induced only a vasodilation in non-preconstricted veins. Phenylephrine consistently induced only a slight vasoconstriction, and Isp produced only a vasodilation. NE-induced vasodilations were reversed to vasoconstrictions after treatment with a relatively larger dose of propranolol. It is concluded that simian facial veins have a spontaneous intrinsic tone and dominant abundant beta-adrenoceptors but sparse alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "85": "The effects of betaxolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on ischemic myocardial acidosis were studied in dog hearts, in which the left anterior descending coronary artery was partially occluded for 90 min, and were compared with those of atenolol and propranolol. Myocardial ischemia produced a decrease in myocardial pH (measured by a micro glass pH electrode) and an elevation of the ST segment of epicardial ECG (assessed by a surface electrode). Betaxolol (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg), atenolol (0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg) or propranolol (0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg), when injected i.v. 30 min after ischemia, restored myocardial pH and the ST segment of ECG that had been altered by partial occlusion. However, the effect of betaxolol on myocardial acidosis was more potent than that of atenolol or propranolol. The decrease in (+)dp/dt by betaxolol (0.03 mg/kg) was less potent than that by atenolol (0.1 mg/kg) and equivalent to that by propranolol (0.1 mg/kg), although the restorations of myocardial acidosis by the drugs were almost equivalent. These results have confirmed that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists attenuate the ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis and have shown that among three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, betaxolol is the most effective in improving myocardial acidosis with a relatively weak effect on myocardial contractile function.", 
    "86": "The effect of altered physiological conditions on the residence time distributions of sucrose, water, and taurocholate in the rat liver were studied using a bolus injection and quantifying fraction of total outflow per ml-time profiles. Retrograde perfusions increased the residence times of sucrose and water markedly and were associated with very low hepatic availabilities for taurocholate. Resistance by the inlet sinusoids sphincters, which become outlet sphincters during retrograde perfusions, is suggested as the explanation for the observation. Infusions of noradrenaline, propranolol, and lidocaine resulted in relatively small changes in the mean residence times for sucrose and water with no apparent relationship existing between the efficiency number of taurocholate and volumes of either water or sucrose. Taurochenodeoxycholate resulted in an increase in the availability and mean residence time for taurocholate relative to no infusion.", 
    "87": "Three renal transplant recipients developed potentially life-threatening hyperkalemia after receiving intravenous labetalol for postoperative hypertension. Even as beta-adrenergic agonists find increasing use in the therapy of acute hyperkalemia, physicians should be aware of the potential of beta blockers to cause profound elevations of serum potassium.", 
    "88": "Homogeneity of recovery time protects against arrhythmias whereas dispersion of recovery time is arrhythmogenic. A single surface electrocardiographic QT interval gives no information on recovery time dispersion but the difference between the maximum and minimum body surface QT interval may be relevant. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the dispersion of the corrected QT interval (QTc) in 10 patients with an arrhythmogenic long QT interval (Romano Ward and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndromes or drug arrhythmogenicity) and in 14 patients without arrhythmias in whom the QT interval was prolonged by sotalol. QTc dispersion was significantly greater in the arrhythmogenic QT group than in the sotalol QT group. In patients with prolonged QT intervals, QT dispersion distinguished between those with ventricular arrhythmias and those without. This supports the hypothesis that QT dispersion reflects spatial differences in myocardial recovery time. QT dispersion may be useful in the assessment of both arrhythmia risk and the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "89": "A new non-imaging echo-Doppler cardiac output device that works on the principle of attenuated compensation volume flow (ACVF), has been used to assess the cardiovascular effects of atenolol and dilevalol in 24 patients with essential hypertension. Compared with the baseline, one month of atenolol reduced systemic mean arterial blood pressure (12 mmHg; P less than 0.01), heart rate (-24 bpm; P less than 0.001), aortic velocity integral (-2.1 cm/sec; P less than 0.01) without a change in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance. Dilevalol reduced systemic mean arterial pressure (-12 mmHg; P less than 0.01) and heart rate (-13 bpm; P less than 0.01), without a change in cardiac output or aortic velocity integral; systemic vascular resistance fell (-149 dyne/sec; P less than 0.01). Thermography and skin thermal clearance techniques were used to assess the effects of each compound on the peripheral circulation; both compounds reduced skin temperature and thermal clearance but the changes were more marked for atenolol than dilevalol. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of dilevalol is, in part, different from atenolol and would be compatible with a direct vasodilator action on the peripheral vasculature.", 
    "90": "We describe two studies which investigate the beta 2-agonist properties of dilevalol. We have previously demonstrated, by giving an infusion of terbutaline to human volunteers, that beta 2-stimulation causes a rise in plasma glucose and a fall in plasma potassium. These metabolic effects can be prevented by prior beta-blockade. We now show that infusion of dilevalol produces similar, but quantitatively smaller, metabolic effects at a dose which also produces clinically significant beta-blockade, as judged by a fall in exercise heart rate. This adds support to the claim that dilevalol is a non-selective beta-blocker with selective beta 2-agonist activity.", 
    "91": "Dilevalol, 200 mg, was administered orally as seven daily doses to three groups of six participants, with differing degrees of renal impairment. Values of Cmax, Tmax, half-life or renal elimination did not significantly change with decreased renal function. Values of area under the plasma concentration-time curves and pre-dose concentrations tended to increase with renal impairment and there was a significant, if small, correlation between these and glomerular filtration rate. The practical clinical consequences of these results is that impairment is not likely to be associated with significant accumulation of dilevalol.", 
    "92": "The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist effects of dilevalol on human heart tissue were studied in vitro. The receptors were studied independently of one another through the use of selective antagonists. Human right atrial appendages were generally cut into four strips which were then set up in parallel in an organ bath system. All tissues were incubated either with 300 nM CGP 20712A to block beta 1-adrenoceptors, or with 50 nM ICI 118551, to block beta 2-adrenoceptors. Alpha-adrenoceptors and tissue uptake of catecholamines were blocked using 5 microM phenoxybenzamine. The atrial strips from one patient were then exposed either to vehicle or to cumulative additions of dilevalol, (+)- pindolol or salbutamol (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) and the resulting force of contraction was expressed as a percentage of the inotropic response obtained with a saturating dose of (-)-isoprenaline. The beta-antagonist effects of the three substances were also studied, by running a dose-response curve to noradrenaline or adrenaline as appropriate following the addition of the substance of interest. Neither dilevalol nor (+)-pindolol had any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity at the atrial beta 1- or beta 2-adrenoceptors. Both dilevalol and (+)-pindolol caused marked antagonism of the atrial beta-adrenoceptors. They caused similar blockade of the beta 2-adrenoceptors but not of the beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "93": "Age may influence the response to antihypertensive drug treatment either indirectly, by altering the plasma drug concentrations, or directly, by altering the nature and magnitude of the blood pressure reduction. This study investigates the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive responses following acute and chronic treatment with dilevalol in 18 patients (age range 28-73 years) with essential hypertension. There were no significant age-related changes in pharmacokinetics for either acute or chronic treatment with dilevalol. Correspondingly, there was no evidence of any age-related difference in the antihypertensive response and, in absolute terms, this was slightly greater in the six oldest patients in whom blood pressure fell by 18/10 mmHg, supine, and 16/8 mmHg, erect, after the first dose of dilevalol, compared to 4/3 and 6/3 mmHg, respectively, in the six youngest patients. When allowance was made for the differences in starting (pretreatment) blood pressure, there was no significant difference in the antihypertensive response of the elderly compared to the young patients. This study has shown that the antihypertensive efficacy of dilevalol is not attenuated in the elderly and that there are no age-related differences either in pharmacokinetics or in antihypertensive responsiveness.", 
    "94": "Dilevalol, the R-R1 isomer of labetalol, has been shown in animal studies to be a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with beta 2-agonist activity and minimal alpha-antagonist activity. This paper describes the results of studies in man which have investigated the dose dependency and selectivity of dilevalol as an adrenoceptor antagonist and demonstrated its lack of alpha-antagonist activity. It also describes the results of studies which have investigated the magnitude of its partial agonist activity and demonstrated the selectivity of the partial agonist activity for the beta 2-adrenoceptor. Oral dilevalol 200 mg reduces an exercise tachycardia by about 25% and 400 mg does not increase the effect. Dilevalol 200 mg had no effect on the rise in blood pressure induced by infusions of phenylephrine, demonstrating its lack of alpha-antagonist activity. The increases in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow and finger tremor induced by infusions of salbutamol are inhibited by dilevalol 200 and 400 mg and propranolol 80 mg to a similar degree indicating the lack of selectivity of the beta-antagonist activity of dilevalol. The effects of increasing oral doses of dilevalol on sleeping heart rate were used to assess the magnitude of its partial agonist activity. Heart rate four hours after dilevalol 200 and 400 mg was seven beats per minute higher than after placebo. Dilevalol 200 and 400 mg did not alter daytime supine heart rate, blood pressure or cardiac output but did increase forearm blood flow and finger tremor indicating that the partial agonist activity is mainly at the beta 2-adrenoceptor."
