This study was performed to assess the effect of sotalol on the dispersion of refractoriness in experimental myocardial infarction. In 9 mongrel dogs, 14 days after induction of myocardial infarction by an occlusion reperfusion technique, programmed ventricular stimulation and epicardial mapping were performed before and during (3 mg/kg + 0.5 mg/kg per hour) sotalol administration. To assess the spatial distribution of refractoriness, ventricular fibrillation (VF) intervals were analyzed. The rationale for this method is that, during VF, when multiple reentrant wavelets are present, cells are excited as soon as they recover from previous activation. The coefficient of variation (standard deviation x 100) served as an index of spatial distribution of refractoriness.", 
    "1": "VF was induced before sotalol in 7 dogs and in 5 of 7 during sotalol administration. The mean value of the index VF intervals decreased from 19.8 +/- 2.3 at baseline to 15.8 +/- 2.6 during sotalol (P = 0.011), indicating a more homogeneous distribution of refractoriness. Thus, the antiarrhythmic effects of sotalol may be mediated by its action on the dispersion of refractoriness.", 
    "2": "In the clinical setting, the ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) is determined by an 8-beat drive train (S1S1), followed by a premature stimulus (S2), which is decremented in subsequent drive trains until capture is lost. Variation in intertrain pauses and capturing extra stimuli disturb steady-state conditions and reduce reproducibility of values found for the VERP. To increase reproducibility, a protocol without intertrain pause and incremental scanning (IS) of S2 was developed. In anesthetized dogs with chronic AV block, determination of the VERP using IS and decremental scanning (DS) without intertrain pause was compared at 800 and 350 msec pacing cycle length (PCL). The measurements were repeated after the administration of d-sotalol to lengthen the VERP and levcromakalim to shorten the VERP. The results showed no difference between IS and DS at both PCLs with or without medication. Recurrent and abrupt rate changes were avoided during IS, making this the protocol of choice when induction of arrhythmias is to be avoided.", 
    "3": "Whether the biological effect of melatonin in humans is directly related to the circulating levels of the hormone, has not heretofore been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether previously described hypothermic melatonin properties are dose related. The nocturnal decline of the body temperature (BT) observed in 16 early follicular phase women, following placebo administration at 18.00 h, was compared with that observed during the preceding or following night, after melatonin suppression with the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol (100 mg). In 6 subjects (37.5%) with lower nocturnal melatonin levels (p < 0.05) atenolol induced a complete melatonin suppression and an attenuation of the nocturnal BT decline (p < 0.02), whereas in the remaining 10 subjects (62.5%) atenolol induced an incomplete melatonin suppression with no modification of the nocturnal BT decline. During a 3rd night, 2 of the 6 subjects with complete and 6 of the 10 subjects with incomplete melatonin suppression blindly received atenolol plus melatonin (1 mg at 19.30 h and 0.75 mg at 21.00 and 23.00 h). Exogenous melatonin restored the full expression of the nocturnal BT decline in the 2 subjects with complete melatonin suppression, but did not modify the BT decline in the 6 subjects with atenolol-induced incomplete melatonin suppression. Our data show that markedly, but not completely attenuated nocturnal melatonin levels are sufficient to exert maximal thermoregulatory effects, indicating rather a threshold than a dose-response effect of melatonin action on human BT.",

    "6": "The results of this study indicated that l-moprolol and dipivefrin had an equivalent effect in lowering the intraocular pressure.

    "8": "In addition to laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and other stressful intraoperative phases, hypertension occurs during recovery from anaesthesia, provoking post-operative complications like bleeding and increased intracranial or intraocular pressure. Furthermore, these hypertensive reactions result in life-threatening complications, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. In this study, the effect of the new, short-acting beta-blocker esmolol given as a single bolus for preventing the increases in blood pressure and heart rate during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation in patients with hypertension was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS. Sixty-three patients with a history of hypertension over a period of more than 6 months and blood pressure (BP) more than 150/90 mm Hg undergoing intervertebral-disc, otolaryngologic, or eye surgery were included in the study. The operations were performed during thiopentone-induced isoflurane anaesthesia with relaxation by atracurium. The patients were assigned to three groups after giving witnessed oral informed consent. During the study period they received the study drug twice: (A) 30-90 s before turning off the nitrous oxide; and (B) 20-90 s before extubation. Group I (placebo) received placebo each time, group II (100 mg esmolol) placebo at A and 100 mg esmolol i.v. at B, and group III (200 mg esmolol) 100 mg esmolol i.v. each time. After each medication the cardiovascular parameters were measured noninvasively over a period of 10 min every minute and in the following 2 h every 15 min. RESULTS. After the first medication systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate (HR), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were lower in patients receiving 100 mg esmolol (Group III) than in groups I and II. After the second injection the blood pressure was lower in the two groups receiving 100 mg esmolol, than the placebo group (I: 180.1 +/- 7.4/100.7 +/- 3.6; II: 152.8 +/- 5.8/87.9 +/- 3.4; III: 157.9 +/- 5.3/91.5 +/- 3.6 mm Hg [mean 2 min +/- SEM]). The changes in HR (I: 88.2 +/- 3.8; II: 75.6 +/- 2.6; III: 72 +/- 3.1 min-1) and RPP (I: 15,800 +/- 900; II: 11,700 +/- 700; III: 11,400 +/- 600) were similar. In 8 of the 20 patients in group III the HR dropped below 60.min-1, but in none of these patients did the BP become instable. CONCLUSIONS. The sympathoadrenergic reaction during recovery from anaesthesia and extubation can be treated by beta-blocking agents, but such therapy is not without risk because of the long half-life and effects of the therapy on other factors such as postoperative loss of intravascular volume. Esmolol is a new, short-acting, cardioselective beta-blocker with a very short plasma distribution time and a elimination half-life of 9.2 min. Thus, the potential risks of beta-blockers due to half-life are minimised. The results of this study show that a dangerous increase in BP and HR with increased myocardial oxygen consumption can be prevented by a single bolus, and better by a double bolus of 100 mg esmolol. Although bradycardia with HR below 50.min-1 in 8 patients might indicate a risk of cardiac instability, the systolic BP did not fall below 100 mm Hg, and the episode of bradycardia was so short that there was no risk to the patients.", 
    "9": "Esmolol, a short-acting intravenous cardioselective beta-blocking agent, was evaluated for age-dependent pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic features in 17 young patients (6 months to 14 years). A loading dose (500 micrograms/kg/min) alternating with a maintenance dose (25-200 micrograms/kg/min, titrating by 25 micrograms/kg/min every 4 min) was infused until the heart rate or mean arterial pressure decreased 10%. Cardiac index, left ventricular shortening fraction, and systemic vascular resistance were measured at baseline, peak esmolol effect, and recovery. Serum esmolol concentrations were obtained to determine the half-life and the elimination rate constant. Esmolol reduced the heart rate, blood pressure, shortening fraction, and cardiac index in all patients, but it did not change systemic vascular resistance. Maintenance esmolol dose was 118 +/- 49 micrograms/kg/min, and the half-life was 2.88 +/- 2.67 min. Blood pressure and heart rate returned to normal within 2-16 min, but cardiac index and shortening fraction took longer to recover. There were no statistically significant age-dependent pharmacodynamic effects, but blood pressure decreased prior to heart rate and cardiac index took longer to recovery in patients who weighed < or = 15 kg. The pharmacokinetic profile in young patients was similar to that of older patients, but the half-life was shorter. The only side effect was transient nausea and vomiting in one patient. Esmolol is a safe and efficacious beta-blocking agent in young patients.", 
    "10": "One hundred seventeen patients with reflux disease were examined with respect to the severity of their disease and oral, dental, and salivary findings. Twenty-eight patients had dental erosion, whereas the remaining 89 patients did not. No mucosal changes could be observed to be linked with the reflux disease. In the mean, the patients with erosion were older (54 versus 49 years), and the mean duration of their reflux disease was longer in comparison to those without erosion (17 versus 11 years, respectively). The severity of the reflux disease was more marked among patients with erosion than in those without as assessed by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the Maratka classification, histologic examination of gastric and esophageal biopsy specimens, and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups in any salivary parameters studied, although the number of patients with low salivary-buffering capacity was higher among those with erosion than among those without. Patients taking beta-blocking agents or tranquilizers had more erosion than those who did not take these medications. The severity of the reflux disease was not associated with any subjective symptoms in the mouth or pharynx. The frequency of consumption of acidic drinks and foodstuffs as determined by a questionnaire did not differ between the patients with and without dental erosion. Thus severe reflux disease of long duration was found to be potentially detrimental to the teeth, whereas milder forms of the disease need not cause dental side effects.", 
    "11": "Celiprolol is a novel beta 1 selective adrenoreceptor blocker with partial beta 2 agonism and direct vasodilator activity. These ancillary properties may reduce symptomatic breathlessness and fatigue and modify respiration during exercise. To test this hypothesis 20 men with stable effort angina were enrolled in a double-blind crossover study to investigate the effects of atenolol 100 mg once daily (A) and celiprolol 400 mg once daily (C) on cardiorespiratory and symptomatic variables during maximal and submaximal exercise. Total exercise time on a modified Bruce protocol was similar on both treatments: C12.5 min, A 13.1 min. During steady state submaximal exercise at 60-75% (mean 68%) of maximum work capacity, minute ventilation (C33.81 min-1, A 33.51 min-1), oxygen uptake (C14.6 ml.kg-1.min-1, A15.1 ml.kg-1.min-1), respiratory exchange ratio (C 0.89, A 0.87), ratio of VE/VCO2 (C 33.6, A 33.4), ratio of VE/VO2 (C 2.34, A 2.72), Borg perceived exertion score (C 11.2, A 10.9) and visual analogue scores for breathlessness (C 29.5, A 25.9) and muscle fatigue (C 28.9, A 26.0) were all similar on both treatments. At maximal exercise capacity on the modified Bruce protocol, minute ventilation (C 58.31 min-1, A 60.41 min-1), oxygen uptake (C 21.3 ml.kg-1.min-1, A 21.7 ml.kg-1.min-1), respiratory exchange ratio (C 1.02, A.1.05), ratio VE/VCO2 (C 34.8, A 35.9), and ratio VE/VO2 (C 2.80, A 2.83) were also similar on both drugs.

    "12": "Previous studies of neurohumoral activation following myocardial infarction have concentrated on the within-hospital phase and have only made measurements at rest. The objectives of this study were to measure neuroendocrine activity in the early convalescent phase of myocardial infarction at rest and during symptom-limited maximal exercise and to study the effects of early drug therapy. We studied 75 patients, mean age 57 (range 37-74) without evidence of overt heart failure, following Q-wave myocardial infarction. Patients were studied a mean of 17 days following myocardial infarction and compared with 11 age-matched control subjects. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, atrial natriuretic peptide and plasma renin activity were measured at rest, at submaximal and symptom-limited maximal treadmill exercise. At the time of study 40 patients were taking beta-blockers, 19 diuretics and 16 no treatment. Atrial natriuretic peptide levels were higher at rest (P = 0.0001) and at symptom-limited exercise (P = 0.002) in the patient group than in the control subjects. Although there were no significant resting differences between the patient subgroups, at symptom-limited exercise plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher in the patients taking beta-blockers than in the other patient groups (P = 0.001). Plasma renin activity was no different between the patients and the control subjects at rest or during exercise. Those patients taking diuretics had higher values at rest (P = 0.001) and during exercise (P = 0.005) compared with the remaining patients. There were no significant differences in resting or maximal exercise levels of plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline between the patients and the control subjects (all P > 0.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "We wished to assess the effects of beta-blockade on baroreflex sensitivity and standard tests of integrity of autonomic nervous function in patients with coronary artery disease, and to determine whether the effects of lipophilic (metoprolol) and hydrophilic (atenolol) beta-blockers differ. Beta-blocking drugs increase spontaneous heart rate variability in healthy subjects and in patients with coronary heart disease, but little is known about their effects on baroreflex sensitivity and heart-rate based tests of autonomic integrity. In a randomly allocated double-blind crossover study with three 2-week treatment periods, metoprolol CR 200 mg once a day, or atenolol 100 mg once a day, or placebo once a day, were administered to 18 male patients with stable coronary artery disease. Baroreflex sensitivity was determined from the natural baroreflex challenge of Valsalva strain. Heart rate reactions to standard stimuli were measured. No significant differences were found between the effects of atenolol and metoprolol. Beta-blockade did not significantly affect the baroreflex sensitivity, but it diminished the Valsalva ratio significantly (P < 0.001). The difference between maximum and minimum heart rate during hyperventilation was also significantly lower during beta-blockade. The heart rate response to standing up and the ratio of maximum to minimum heart rate during deep breathing were not influenced by beta-blockade. Discontinuation of beta-blockade seems to be unnecessary for reliable determination of baroreflex sensitivity in patients with coronary artery disease, when the natural pressure challenge of Valsalva strain is sued. Both hydrophilic and lipophilic bet-blockers interfere with certain diagnostic tests of autonomic nervous function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Several derivatives of 3-hydrazinopyridazine are reported to possess interesting biological properties as chemotherapeutics, anti-inflammatory agents, CNS depressants and stimulants and anti-hypertensives. In particular, variously substituted 3-hydrazinopyridazines raised considerable interest as peripheral vasodilators with improved potency and safety compared to hydralazine and dihydralazine. More recently, some compounds bearing substituents which may also account for beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties were prepared and studied in approaches aimed at combining in single molecules both the vasodilating and the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity in an appropriate balance. When substituents are alkylic or arylic, the pyridazine nucleus is synthesized through the appropriate 4-oxoacid, otherwise 3,6-dichloropyridazine is generally used as starting compound. In the latter case, while the nucleophilic substitution of the first chlorine atom is easily obtained, the reactivity of the second chlorine is considerably reduced when the first group introduced has electro-donating properties (alkoxy or alkylamino groups) and an excess of hydrazine is required under forcing conditions. Since 3-chloro-6-hydrazinopyridazine is practically unreactive, it was found to be convenient to convert it to 3-chloro-6-(triphenylmethylazo)pyridazine, whose halogen atom is activated towards nucleophiles, and to restore the hydrazino group after the substitution. 3-Hydrazinopyridazines are extensively metabolized, mainly by acetylation of the free hydrazino group, followed by cyclization, or by reaction with endogenous carbonyl compounds and, to a lower extent, by hydrolysis or oxidation. When the hydrazino group is protected, biotransformation is generally less extensive, giving rise to an active metabolite which in turn follows the metabolic pathways outlined above. Interestingly, pharmacokinetic studies on cadralazine (a 3-hydrazinopyridazine protected as ethoxycarbonyl derivative) support the attractive hypothesis that the pro-drug is biotransformed topically to the active metabolite in the endothelium of arterial vessels, close to the site at which smooth muscle relaxation is required.", 
    "15": "During the last 10-15 years, a total of 49 prospective, randomized, controlled studies have been performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early administered beta-receptor antagonists in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Those trials in which beta-receptor antagonists were administered intravenously followed by oral medication within 72 h after the onset of symptoms reported a significant reduction in early mortality (on average 13%; 95% confidence interval -2% to -25%). The efficacy of beta-receptor antagonists in reducing mortality was particularly obvious in patients at higher risk (i.e., older patients, previous infarction) with the maximal efficacy observed during the first 3-4 days of therapy. Similarly, there was a reduction in the incidence of reinfarction which averaged 19% for the patients treated with beta-receptor antagonists. The metaanalysis also showed a significant reduction in the incidence of nonfatal cardiac arrest due to primary ventricular fibrillation for the group receiving beta-receptor antagonists (average risk reduction 16%; 95% confidence interval -2% to -30%). As calculated on the basis of the ISIS-1 data, treatment with beta-receptor antagonists in approximately 200 patients with acute myocardial infarction would lead to the avoidance of one death, one reinfarction, and one episode of ventricular fibrillation. Based on these data, it is recommended that administration of beta-receptor antagonists should be an important adjunctive therapeutic modality in patients with acute myocardial infarction and no contraindications for this form of treatment.", 
    "16": "The muscarinic receptor blocker, scopolamine, inhibits the display of lordosis behavior in female rats but its effectiveness depends on hormonal conditions. In these experiments, systemic administration of scopolamine (0.031-4 mg/kg) inhibited lordosis in ovariectomized rats brought into receptivity by treatment with a low dose of estradiol benzoate (EB, 0.25 micrograms for 3 days) with progesterone (P, 500 micrograms for 1 day), or a high dose of EB (25 micrograms for 3 days) with and without P. However, the effectiveness of scopolamine was reduced at the high dose of EB and with the addition of P. Furthermore, scopolamine failed to inhibit lordosis in females treated on a second week with the high dose of EB with or without P, unless an interval of at least 3 weeks separated the two sets of steroid treatments. The reduced effectiveness of scopolamine cannot be explained by peripheral mechanisms because its inhibitory effect on lordosis also was reduced following repeated hormonal exposure even when scopolamine was infused directly into the lateral ventricles.",

Parakeratosis, papillomatosis, and formation of microabscesses, all characteristic signs of psoriasis, have not been seen in any of the skin samples of this group. Skin samples from group 1 animals receiving propranolol orally showed normal epidermis and dermis. They showed exactly the same histologic picture as the control groups 3 and 4.", 
    "20": "Beta-blockers given orally for 30 days do not cause any significant skin changes in guinea pigs. When given with a weekly intradermal injection of Freund's complete adjuvant, they cause psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia. Although the overall histologic appearance of the skin of group 2 resembled psoriasis, it lacked important histologic features characteristic of this disease. It seems, therefore, that the model, per se, does not fulfill the initial expectations as an experimental model for psoriasis; however, this model has potential in the study of adverse drug reactions. Perhaps by introducing modifications to the experimental protocol, we may succeed also in developing a better model for experimental psoriasis.",

Multiple endocrine neoplasia existed in four cases. Various preoperative symptoms were noted, including complaints typical of the respective syndromes and general abdominal symptoms. Other patients were symptom-free with incidental findings. An intercostal approach was used in 30 cases, a transabdominal approach in 3 cases. In 6 cases bilateral and in 27 cases unilateral adrenalectomy was performed. In two cases additional nephrectomy became necessary because of extensive adhesions. Intraoperatively, one patient suffered a blood pressure crisis. 31 patients are still alive and symptom-free after a mean follow-up of 5.4 years (range 1-11 years). Two patients have died (one with benign pheochromocytoma and one with a metastasis of lung cancer). Detailed preoperative hormone analysis and adequate preoperative medication substantially lowers the risk involved in adrenal surgery. However, the indications for surgical treatment of hormonally inactive, symptom-free adrenal tumors that are found incidentally remain controversial, and surgery should perhaps be restricted to large tumors.", 
    "22": "This study has investigated the roles of noradrenaline (NA) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) in sympathetic vasoconstriction of the main ear artery from guinea-pigs. A range of agents which interact with adrenoceptors or purinoceptors was tested on contractions produced by exogenous NA or ATP, and on contractions produced by transmural stimulation of sympathetic axons. Contractions produced by NA were antagonized competitively by prazosin (Schild plot slope 0.88 +/- 0.13, not significantly different from 1.0). Dihydroergotamine (10 microM) produced significant depression of contractions produced by all concentrations of NA. Yohimbine (1 microM) caused a small rightward shift in the NA concentration-response curves (0.34 log units), whereas propranolol had no effect. alpha,beta,m-ATP (6 microM) enhanced contractions produced by low concentrations of NA (0.1-1 microM), whereas suramin (30 microM) produced a slight depression in the maximum NA-induced contraction in all experiments. Contractions produced by ATP (0.1 mM) were greatly reduced by suramin (30 microM; 59% reduction) and by alpha,beta,m-ATP (6 microM); 96% reduction), and were slightly depressed by dihydroergotamine (10 microM; 12% reduction). Transmural electrical stimulation with trains of 200-300 pulses produced contractions which were rapid in onset and recovery, and sometimes were biphasic. Contractions at both 5 Hz and 20 Hz were reduced by 50-70% after treatment with prazosin (0.1-1 microM). The remaining contractions were enhanced significantly by yohimbine (1 microM), were reduced very slightly by dihydroergotamine, and were largely abolished by guanethidine (1 microM). alpha,beta,m-ATP (1-100 microM) alone often enhanced neurogenic contractions (by 100-200%), whereas suramin (30 microM) alone reduced contractions by 48%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The dose of metoprolol ranged between 50-100 mg per day. The primary outcome variables for the study were the resting and exercise mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and cardiac index (CI) and the secondary outcome variables consisted of resting and exercise heart rate, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), mean pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and clinical improvement on visual analog scale. These outcome variables were assessed blindly. The resting and exercise mean PCWP (mmHg) increased by 9.1 +/- 3.1 and 16.4 +/- 6.4 on placebo and 2.5 +/- 2.1 and -4.6 +/- 2.3 on metoprolol after 6 months therapy.

The effect of estradiol on this activity was studied in rats that were ovariectomized in diestrus 1, injected with estradiol benzoate (50 micrograms/kg body weight), and killed 48 h later. The effect of progesterone was studied in fractions from female cycling rats injected in the morning of diestrus 2 with progesterone (2 mg/rat); these animals were killed 30 or 48 h after the steroid injection. The blockade of norepinephrine-induced adenylate cyclase activity by alpha- and beta-blocking agents (10(-8)-10(-9) M) was also evaluated. The enzymatic activity was determined by monitoring the capacity to produce cAMP from ATP at saturated levels; cAMP was assayed by radioimmunoassay. At 48 h after administration, estradiol benzoate increased the norepinephrine-induced adenylate cyclase activity in the hypothalamus. This effect was not changed by the presence of phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, but was greatly reduced by propranolol, the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker. In contrast, the progesterone, at 30 and 48 h after injection, decreased the hypothalamic adenylate cyclase activity, and this effect was preferentially antagonized in the presence of phenoxybenzamine rather than propranolol. These results suggest that estrogen and progesterone act selectively on one or another type of adrenergic receptor at the hypothalamic level.",

It reduced the lipoprotein ratio (P < 0.05) but did not modify the fibrinolytic activity of the endothelium. Doxazosin increased the fibrinolytic index (ratio of plasminogen activator to its main inhibitor) before (P < 0.05) and after anoxia (P < 0.0001) and the lipoprotein ratio (P < 0.001), without an anti-ischaemic effect. Carvedilol increased the effort time (P < 0.05), reducing total ischaemia (P < 0.05), the number of ischaemic episodes (P < 0.01), and increasing the post-anoxia fibrinolytic index (P < 0.05) without modifying the lipid profile.", 
    "32": "At antihypertensive equipotent doses, the inhibition of alpha 1-receptors improves the endothelial fibrinolytic activity and the lipid profile. beta-Blockade has an anti-ischaemic action, but reduces the lipoprotein ratio (ApoA/ApoB) and does not improve endothelial fibrinolytic activity.", 
    "33": "Propafenone (Pro) and lidocaine (Lid) were incubated with rat liver supernatant and coenzyme factor. The competitive oxidations with each other were established. The original drug concentration of Pro and Lid were increased 0.7 and 0.5 times, respectively; and the metabolite dimethlglycinexylide (DGX) of Lid to be formed was decreased about 2/3 of that produced when administered alone. It was suggested that 1) they were metabolized by the same cytochrome P450 III A4 and the isozyme could be saturated, 2) the convulsive toxicity due to DGX will be decreased with its diminished formation, and 3) the combination of Lid and Pro would be beneficial for treatment of arrhythmias.", 
    "34": "EFFECT OF ELIMINATION HALF-LIFE ON TROUGH:PEAK RATIO IN BETA-BLOCKERS: Maximal beta-adrenoceptor blockade and peak blood pressure reduction are achieved with plasma concentrations that are below the peak postdose concentrations observed when therapeutic doses are given. As a result, any trough:peak variation in the blood pressure response is likely to depend on the proportion of the dose interval during which maximal beta-blockade is maintained, and on the relationship between the elimination half-life of the drug, the dose and the dose interval. Acceptable trough:peak ratios (> 70%) for the blood pressure response to beta-blockade with a single daily dose are usually found with drugs that have an elimination half-life of over 6 h or when slow-release preparations are used for drugs with a shorter half-life. OTHER FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE TROUGH:PEAK RATIO: The interpretation of trough:peak ratios when beta-blockers are used may be complicated by circadian variations in the blood pressure response, with low blood pressure levels during sleep and an early morning rise upon waking. The blood pressure response-time relationships for beta-blockers with vasodilator properties appear to be similar to those for 'plain' beta-blockers, although there may be greater attenuation of the rise in blood pressure upon waking when multiple-action agents are used. Furthermore, the blood pressure of elderly patients with systolic hypertension may show an attenuated response to beta-blockers, resulting in a less favourable trough:peak ratio.", 
    "35": "It is not clear whether blood pressure 'responders' to beta-blockers have a pattern of response that is different from the mean of a heterogeneous group. Further studies with appropriate designs are required to clarify these issues.",

    "37": "Survey of published studies.", 
    "38": "The results are sometimes unclear and, for some drugs, contradictory. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists appear to have no effect on blood pressure variability, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists and atropine can lessen the amplitude of the variations. Similarly, there is a decrease after the administration of clonidine. Guanfacine, however, which acts on the same central receptors, does not lessen variability. Calcium antagonists do not influence blood pressure variability and the results with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are contradictory.", 
    "39": "From these results we conclude that blood pressure variability is not dependent on beta-receptor activity or calcium-mediated mechanisms. It is most likely that both alpha-adrenergic tone and the vagal system have significant effects on blood pressure variability.",

    "41": "In a multicenter double-blind trial, 106 mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients were treated with either carvedilol (n = 51), or nifedipine (n = 55) as monotherapy. Following 4 weeks of wash-out/run-in period, patients from the carvedilol group received this drug once a day at a dosage of 25 mg/day for 8 consecutive weeks. In order to maintain the double-blind character of the study, a placebo was administered in the carvedilol group at identical dosage intervals as used in the nifedipine s.r. group. Nifedipine was also administered for 8 weeks at a dosage of 40 mg/day given b.i.d.", 
    "42": "Both treatments were equally efficient in reducing blood pressure in the seated and upright positions. Blood pressure response to treatment was obtained in 79% and 78% of patients treated with carvedilol and nifedipine, respectively. The carvedilol group did not develop reflex tachycardia which is usually seen when prescribing vasodilators. Blood biochemistry remained unchanged with both treatments. Besides similar blood pressure efficacy, side effects by patients taking carvedilol were less frequent than nifedipine group.",

    "44": "Insulin sensitivity in terms of glucose disposal rate was determined by using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique in seven obese hypertensive patients and nine normotensive control subjects. The technique was used on all study subjects at baseline and on the hypertensive patients after 12 weeks of arotinolol treatment. Mean supine systolic blood pressure decreased from 155 +/- 3 mm Hg before treatment to 133 +/- 6 mm Hg after treatment (P < 0.02), and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 100 +/- 3 mm Hg before treatment to 86 +/- 3 mm Hg after treatment (P < 0.05). The mean dose of arotinolol was 10 mg/d, except for one patient who received 20 mg/d. The glucose disposal rate during the last 30 minutes of the glucose clamp procedure was not significantly affected by treatment with arotinolol. Compared with the hypertensive patients, the glucose disposal rate in the normotensive subjects was significantly increased, both before and after treatment (P < 0.01). The study results show that the obese hypertensive patients were insulin resistant and that treatment with arotinolol did not significantly affect insulin sensitivity.", 
    "45": "The respective effects of 6 month's administration of beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, carteolol and arotinolol), calcium-channel blockers (nicardipine, diltiazem) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were evaluated in hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), using a retrospective method. NIDDM patients with stable HbA1c and body weight were selected for this study. The following results were obtained. (1) The administration of nicardipine or beta-blockers significantly elevated HbA1c levels. (2) The administration of diltiazem or enalapril did not have any influence on HbA1c levels. These findings suggest that not only beta-blocker but nicardipine (dihydropyridine type calcium-channel blocker) may cause deterioration in glucose metabolism in NIDDM patients.",

Oral administration of amosulalol (1-30 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent antihypertensive effect without reflex tachycardia in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with a duration > 10 h after the higher doses (10 and 30 mg/kg). Amosulalol was approximately threefold more potent than labetalol and arotinolol in decreasing blood pressure (BP) in conscious SHR. Oral (p.o.) administration of amosulalol 10 mg/kg produced equally potent reductions in mean arterial BP (MBP) without reflex tachycardia in deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt rats (DHR) and renal hypertensive rats (RHR) as it did in SHR. Repeated oral administration (1, 4, 8, or 12 weeks) of amosulalol 10 mg/kg elicited an antihypertensive effect without evidence of tolerance in conscious SHR and produced a rightward shift in phenylephrine (PE)-induced vasopressor and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced positive chronotropic responses with dose ratios of 3.3-12.5 and 3.7-6.4, respectively, in pithed SHR. In addition, single p.o. administration of amosulalol 10 mg/kg produced a rightward shift in these responses with dose ratios of 12.1 and 3.5, respectively, in pithed SHR. Amosulalol exerted antihypertensive activity without tachycardia through blockade of vascular alpha- and cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, and its activities were constant even after repeated p.o. administration.", 
    "47": "ATP is an effective treatment of supraventricular tachycardia when the atrioventricular (AV) node is part of the reentrant circuit. However, the lower a pace-maker in the pacemaker hierarchy, the more sensitive it is to adenosine. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ATP on ventricular automaticity in in vivo and in vitro conditions. Wide and narrow QRS complex tachycardia in 46 patients was treated with 6, 12, and 18 mg ATP as sequential intravenous (i.v.) bolus. ATP terminated tachycardias in 67%. Bolus infusion ATP caused < or = 6.4-s asystole that was self-limited. Perfusion of isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig heart with 100 microM ATP completely suppressed ventricular automaticity. After ATP-infusion was discontinued, the first ventricular beat was evident after 3.1 +/- 0.9 s and sinus node activity recovered with a time constant of 3.0 +/- 1.1 s. Because sinus node and ventricular automaticity recovered within seconds after ATP infusion was discontinued in vitro, recovery in vivo is also likely to be determined by the short half-life (+1/2) of ATP.", 
    "48": "Modulation of the beta-adrenergic control of cardiac L-type Ca2+ current (Ica) by human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) was examined in adult guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the whole cell voltage-clamp technique. ICa was elicited in Cs(+)-loaded myocytes by depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of -40 mV. Isoproterenol (0.01 and 1 microM) exposed to myocytes pretreated with 1 ng/ml IL-1 evoked a significantly smaller increase in ICa density compared with control cells. This IL-1-mediated decrease in beta-responsiveness was usually observed with pretreatment periods of > 1 h and varied as a function of the L-arginine concentration of the pretreatment medium. In addition, it was prevented by 1) IL-1 receptor antagonist, 2) substituting D-arginine for L-arginine, or 3) incubating cells with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. Thus the present data illustrate that IL-1 significantly alters the beta-adrenergic control of cardiac Ca2+ channels by cellular mechanisms that involve the activation of nitric oxide synthase. These mechanisms may play a role in altering ventricular function during cytokine-mediated inflammatory processes affecting the heart.", 
    "49": "The effect of bradykinin (BK) on the contraction of rat mesangial cells (MC) was compared with that of various vasoactive agents. BK induced a dose-dependent contraction [one-half maximal effective dose (ED50) = 50 nM] inhibited by the B2 antagonist, HOE-140 (ED50 = 10 nM). BK-induced MC contraction was independent of extracellular calcium and was reduced by inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). Neomycin completely prevented the increase in intracellular calcium and the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induced by BK but only reduced cell contraction. Inhibition of prostaglandin (PG) formation and administration of the endoperoxide antagonist SQ-27427 also partly decreased the effect of BK. Interestingly, only the addition of both neomycin and mepacrine resulted in a complete inhibition of cell contraction. These results suggest that BK, via a B2-kinin receptor, induces contraction of MC through two distinct mechanisms, one associated to the phospholipase C pathway and subsequent activation of PKC and the second one dependent on PG formation. These in vitro effects may be relevant in explaining the effects of BK and converting enzyme inhibitors on glomerular hemodynamics.", 
    "50": "A decrease in endothelium-derived relaxing factor or nitric oxide has been proposed as a potential mechanism of increased vascular resistance in hypertension. An increase in the generation of superoxide anions, which degrade nitric oxide and induce platelet aggregation, may also compromise regional blood flow in hypertension. Recent studies show that human neutrophils generate nitric oxide, which has a similar biologic profile to the endothelium-derived relaxing factor. This study measured nitric oxide synthase activity and superoxide generation in human neutrophils and platelet aggregation in patients with essential hypertension. Nitric oxide synthase activity, measured as conversion of 3H-L-arginine to 3H-L-citrulline, in peripheral blood neutrophils was decreased in hypertensive subjects (percent conversion of 3H-L-arginine: 4.2 +/- 0.5 vs 9.0 +/- 3.0 in control subjects; p < 0.01). Neutrophil superoxide anion generation, measured as conversion of ferricytochrome C to ferrocytochrome C, in response to phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (100 ng/ml) was higher in hypertensive subjects (17.5 +/- 8.1 vs 13.2 +/- 3.0 nmoles/10(6) cells/10 minutes in control subjects; p < 0.05). Patients were treated with a selective beta blocker, celiprolol, for 8 weeks. Supine blood pressure decreased from 177/103 mm Hg (mean +/- SD 18/7) to 160/92 mm Hg (mean +/- 10/5; p < 0.02), while heart rate was unchanged (73 +/- 11 vs 69 +/- 10 beats/min). Epinphrine and adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was also increased in hypertensive subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "To study the effects of class III agents on QT/QTc dispersion in patients with heart disease and cardiac arrhythmias, QT dispersion and QRS and RR intervals were compared in patients before and after treatment with amiodarone (n = 26), sematilide (n = 26), and sotalol (n = 26). QT, QRS, and RR intervals, and QTc values were calculated for each complex, and their mean values were calculated for each lead. QT and QTc dispersions were defined as differences between the minimal and maximal QT or QTc values in each of the 12 leads studied. Amiodarone, sematilide, and sotalol all significantly prolonged the QT interval and the QTc value. Significant reductions in QT and QTc dispersions were only found in the amiodarone group (QT dispersions: 79 +/- 13 vs 49 +/- 14 ms; p < 0.001; QTc dispersions: 0.08 +/- 0.02 vs 0.05 +/- 0.01 s1/2; p < 0.001). The mean RR interval was significantly increased in patients after treatment with amiodarone (p < 0.001) and sotalol (p < 0.001), but not in patients receiving sematilide treatment (p > 0.2). The baseline QT and QTc dispersions were significantly greater in patients with than without myocardial infarction before treatment (p < 0.001). The mean baseline values for QT/QTc dispersions were not significantly different among all 3 groups. However, only amiodarone significantly reduced the QT dispersion (from 76 +/- 10 to 46 +/- 11 ms; p < 0.001) and QTc dispersion (from 0.09 +/- 0.02 to 0.05 +/- 0.01 s1/2; p < 0.001) in patients with myocardial infarction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "GABAA receptor channels (GABARs) composed of different combinations of rat alpha 1, beta 1, gamma 2L, and delta subunits were expressed transiently in mouse fibroblast cells (L929 cells). Whole-cell recordings were obtained from transfected cells to determine which combinations of GABAR subunits formed functional receptor channels, and to compare the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of GABAR channels expressed in the presence and absence of the delta subunit. Only alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L, alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L delta, and alpha 1 beta 1 delta subunit combinations assembled to form functional GABAR channels and the presence of the delta-subunit slowed the rate of acute desensitization of GABA-evoked current during GABA application and the rate of recovery of GABA-evoked current following GABA application. These three different GABAR channel isoforms also showed distinct pharmacological profiles with differential sensitivity to block by zinc. Zinc was a potent blocker of alpha 1 beta 1 delta GABAR channels, a moderate-strength blocker of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L delta GABAR channels, and did not block the alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L GABAR channels. These findings suggest that GABAR isoforms containing the delta subunit constitute a novel GABAR channel with distinct electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics.", 
    "53": "The effect of a potassium channel opener, YM 934, on neurogenic airway plasma leakage was examined in anesthetized guinea pigs. Airway plasma leakage was evoked by stimulation of both vagal nerves in the presence of atropine (1 mg/kg, intravenous) and propranolol (1 mg/kg, intravenous), and was measured by extravasation of Evans blue dye (30 mg/kg, intravenous) in trachea (Tr), main bronchi (MB), and central (cIPA) and peripheral intrapulmonary airways (pIPA). Vagal stimulation significantly increased the dye leakage in all portions of the airway. YM 934 (10, 30, and 100 micrograms/kg, intravenous) inhibited vagally-induced plasma leakage in Tr, MB, cIPA, and pIPA, and this inhibitory effect of YM 934 was reduced by the ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker, glibenclamide (25 mg/kg, intravenous). By contrast, YM 934 (100 micrograms/kg, intravenous) had no inhibitory effect on exogenous substance P (0.5 and 1 micrograms/kg, intravenous)-induced plasma leakage in any parts of the airway. These results indicate that YM 934 inhibits airway neurogenic inflammation by modulating the release of neuropeptides from the sensory nerve endings, and that the inhibitory effect can be attributed to the potassium channel opening activity of this compound.", 
    "54": "The antiarrhythmic and proarrhythmic effects of flecainide were assessed in 21 anesthetized cats. Ventricular arrhythmias can be reproducibly induced in cats by the combination of acute myocardial ischemia and sympathetic stimulation. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), sustained (sVT) and nonsustained (nsVT) ventricular tachycardia (VT), or ventricular fibrillation (VF) may be induced by a 1-minute left stellate ganglion stimulation during a 3-minute coronary artery occlusion. After three trials yielding consistent results, flecainide (2 mg/kg intravenous bolus plus 2 mg.kg-1.hr-1 intravenous infusion) was injected and two additional trials performed. Eight cats also underwent two trials after propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) administered while flecainide infusion was maintained. Flecainide decreased heart rate and blood pressure and slightly prolonged JTc (9%, p < 0.05). It markedly augmented QRS duration (61%, p < 0.0001), which was increased by an additional 61% (p < 0.0001) during sympathetic stimulation. VF was observed in 8 animals and never after flecainide (p < 0.05). However, after drug administration all cats had VT (2 nsVT and 6 sVT), and 5 required cardiac massage. Flecainide did not prevent the occurrence of nsVT in 6 cats, and it worsened arrhythmias by inducing VT (4 nsVT and 2 sVT) in 6 cats with only PVCs or without arrhythmias in the control trials. Propranolol, administered while flecainide infusion was maintained, prevented the increase in heart rate and the marked QRS prolongation during sympathetic stimulation (4 +/- 3 vs 52 +/- 16 msec, p < 0.05) and abolished the proarrhythmic effect of flecainide in 4 of 5 animals. Thus flecainide, despite an antifibrillatory effect, does not prevent and actually may favor the occurrence of sVT during acute myocardial ischemia and enhanced sympathetic activity. Propranolol, by countering the increase in heart rate during sympathetic stimulation, prevented the rate-dependent conduction delay and abolished the proarrhythmic effect of flecainide. The exacerbation, whenever a transient ischemic episode is accompanied by elevated sympathetic activity, of the ischemia-induced conduction delay caused by flecainide may in part explain the mortality data in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial.", 
    "55": "Intracranial administration of metyrapone, a blocker of the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, which is essential for the biosynthesis of corticosteroids, resulted in profound stimulation of the nucleus preopticus and the CRF-ACTH axis in the teleost, Clarias batrachus. It is suggested that the putative blockade of the neurosteroid biosynthesis following metyrapone might be responsible for this action. The present study for the first time uncovers the possibility of inhibitory regulation of the CRF-ACTH axis by metyrapone sensitive neurosteroids.", 
    "56": "To determine the modulatory effect of noradrenaline (NA) on basal release of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), we measured the extracellular GABA with a brain microdialysis technique in the kitten visual cortex. Local infusion of NA through a cannula, which was implanted 2 mm away from the dialysis probe, gave rise to a marked increase in GABA release. This NA-induced GABA release was suppressed by tetrodotoxin, a sodium channel blocker, which was perfused at the probe site. The effect of NA was antagonized by pretreatment with metoprolol, a beta 1-selective antagonist. These results suggest that the cortical noradrenergic system may be involved in the regulation of basal GABA release that is possibly due to the activity of inhibitory neurones in the kitten visual cortex.", 
    "57": "It has been shown that 1 h restraint shortens pentobarbital (PbNa)-induced sleeping time and that brain corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is involved in the mechanism by which restraint shortens. PbNa-induced sleeping time. The present study was designed to further examine the mechanism of the antagonistic effect of 1 h restraint on PbNa in rats. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of propranolol and metoprolol, but not butoxamine reversed the shortening of PbNa-induced sleeping time by 1 h restraint. The i.c.v. administration of phentolamine blocked the shortening of PbNa-induced sleeping time by restraint, while the same dose of phentolamine prolonged the sleeping time in unrestrained rats. Atropine did not affect the PbNa-induced sleeping time in restrained rats. These results suggest that in addition to CRH, the brain beta 1-adrenergic system is involved in the restraint stress-induced increase in arousal.", 
    "58": "Substantial evidence from animal studies suggests that enhanced memory associated with emotional arousal results from an activation of beta-adrenergic stress hormone systems during and after an emotional experience. To examine this implication in human subjects, we investigated the effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol hydrochloride on long-term memory for an emotionally arousing short story, or a closely matched but more emotionally neutral story. We report here that propranolol significantly impaired memory of the emotionally arousing story but did not affect memory of the emotionally neutral story. The impairing effect of propranolol on memory of the emotional story was not due either to reduced emotional responsiveness or to nonspecific sedative or attentional effects. The results support the hypothesis that enhanced memory associated with emotional experiences involves activation of the beta-adrenergic system.", 
    "59": "Hypertrophy of isolated adult feline cardiac muscle cells may be induced in culture by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic agonists. However, it has been shown previously that each of these agonists activate different subsets of immediate-early response genes and have different effects on expression of \"fetal\" protein isoforms and stimulation of protein synthesis. Moreover, in adult feline heart cells, beta-adrenergic agonists, such as isoproterenol, activate sustained synchronous beating and sarcomeric reorganization while alpha-adrenergic agonists, such as phenylephrine, do not. The objective of the present study was to determine whether these differences in proximal signaling events converged in a common signal pathway during activation of contractile protein synthesis. By direct comparisons of actin and myosin heavy chain (HC) synthesis and accumulation following isoproterenol and phenylephrine, it was determined that both agonists stimulate a coordinated accumulation of these proteins during cardiomyocyte growth. However, each agonist stimulated a very different program of contractile protein synthesis. During phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy, actin and myosin HC syntheses were rapidly and coordinately activated and continuously maintained at rates 10-25% greater than untreated cultures. The pattern of myosin HC synthesis following isoproterenol was very much more complex with periods during which it was as much as 40% greater or 25% less than in control cultures. Furthermore, there was no correlation between rates of actin and myosin HC synthesis following isoproterenol. It was concluded that actin and myosin HC syntheses and accumulation were regulated independently and in a very different manner following isoproterenol or phenylephrine. Since protein accumulation was not correlated with synthesis rates during development of hypertrophy, it was also concluded that post-translational mechanisms played a significant role in the maintenance of contractile protein stoichiometry during beta-adrenergic/beating-induced hypertrophy. Myosin HC synthesis also appeared to be independently regulated during cardiomyocyte atrophy induced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Unlike the case in hypertrophy, however, protein balance was not maintained in nifedipine, and the depression of myosin HC synthesis and loss of myosin HC content were much greater than in the case of other contractile proteins.", 
    "60": "The objective of this study was to determine the structure of talinolol metabolites formed and the amounts excreted in urine. Talinolol metabolites in urine were identified by comparing their HPLC retention times and their GC-MS profile with those of previously characterized reference compounds. The metabolites were quantified by HPLC with a normal-phase silica column, a single chloroform extraction and UV detection. Less than 1% of an administered dose was found in urine as hydroxylated talinolol. Other metabolites could be excluded. A sensitive method to determine talinolol in serum and a simple method for analysis of talinolol in urine are described. These methods were found to be precise and accurate for the measurement of talinolol in samples obtained from patients during chronic talinolol treatment as well as from healthy volunteers after a single dose of talinolol.", 
    "61": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method using a chiral AGP column was developed to screen and determine the enantiomers of bunolol in human urine. The recovery of (+)- and (-)-bunolol from urine was 91.79-95.23% at different concentrations. The coefficients of variation (C.V.) were less than 2.1 and 2.3% for intra- and inter-assays, respectively. Urinary metabolites were detected using GC-MS after derivatization with N-methyl(trimethylsilyl)trifluroacetamide. The influences of pH and modifier on a chiral AGP column were studied.", 
    "62": "Repeated treatment of primary cultures of fetal rat septal neurons with 5-HT1A receptor agonists (8-OH-DPAT, ipsapirone, gepirone and buspirone) increased choline acetyltransferase activity after 6-7 days in culture. This effect was optimal with ipsapirone (+ 50-80% at 1 microM of the agonist), and could be prevented by potent 5-HT1A receptor antagonists such as (-)-tertatolol and (+)-WAY 100135. Under conditions where they completely suppressed the stimulatory effect of NGF on choline acetyltransferase in these cultures, specific anti-NGF antibodies did not alter the stimulatory effect of ipsapirone, suggesting that a possible release of NGF from some septal cells did not account for the effect of 5-HT1A receptor stimulation. Autoradiographic investigations with [3H]8-OH-DPAT as radioligand and immunocytochemistry with specific anti-choline acetyltransferase antibodies and anti-rat 5-HT1A receptor antibodies showed that 5-HT1A receptors were expressed on septal neurons in culture, notably on the cholinergic neurons identified by their positive staining with anti-choline acetyltransferase antibodies. Detailed morphometrical analysis by computer-assisted imaging revealed that repeated exposure to ipsapirone (1 microM for 7 days) did not influence the survival of cholinergic as well as non-cholinergic neurons, but specifically altered the neuritic tree (i.e. the total length of neurites and the number of branching points) of cholinergic neurons only. These data suggest that under in vitro conditions ipsapirone and other 5-HT1A receptor agonists may exert a direct trophic action on septal cholinergic neurons.",

    "64": "A multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted over an average of 5 years' followup involving 16 academic clinical trial clinics. Participants consisted of 4736 persons (1.06%) selected from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and older. Systolic blood pressure at baseline ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg, while diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to active antihypertensive drug therapy or matching placebo. Active treatment consisted of 12.5 to 25 mg of chlorthalidone for step 1, while step 2 consisted of 25 to 50 mg of atenolol. If atenolol was contraindicated, 0.05 to 0.10 mg of reserpine could be used for the second-step drug. The impact of drug treatment on measures of cognitive, emotional, and physical function and leisure activities was assessed.", 
    "65": "Our analyses demonstrate that active treatment of isolated systolic hypertension in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program cohort had no measured negative effects and, for some measures, a slight positive effect on cognitive, physical, and leisure function. The positive findings in favor of the treatment group were small. There was no effect on measures related to emotional state. Measures of cognitive and emotional function were stable in both groups for the duration of the study. Both treatment groups showed a modest trend toward deterioration of some measures of physical and leisure function over the study period.",

However, mood, cognitive function, basic self-care, and moderate leisure activity were remarkably stable for both the active and the placebo groups throughout the entire study.

    "67": "A male preterm infant (born at 34 weeks, birth weight 2130 g) developed jaundice (total bilirubin 7.4 mg/dl), hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia (82,000/microliters) and a raised C-reactive protein (1.2 mg/dl). Although sepsis was suspected, no organism was demonstrated. When the mother visited the child for the first time after 2 weeks, she had florid hyperthyroidism. This explained many of the child's clinical features (poor weight gain, tachycardia, exophthalmos). Both mother and child had raised TSH receptor antibodies (mother: 684.6 U/l; 54.1 U/l, normal < 15 U/l), an increased free T4 and a suppressed TSH. Because of the tachycardia, the child was treated with propranolol (1 mg/kg.d for 5 weeks). He was also initially given Lugol's solution (25 mg iodide/kg.d for 1 week) and then propylthiouracil (7 mg/kg.d) because of the increasing total T3. L-Thyroxine replacement was subsequently required for a period of 2.5 weeks because of treatment-related hypothyroidism. Since stopping treatment (at 12 weeks of age), the child has developed normally.--Neonatal hyperthyroidism due to transplacental transfer of TSH receptor antibodies associated with maternal Graves' disease is a rare self-limiting condition. However, it may pose considerable danger to the child both in utero and postnatally (with a mortality if untreated of up to 20%). Interdisciplinary cooperation is essential.", 
    "68": "Bovine adrenal medullary membranes were incubated with [125I]cyanopindolol to assess beta-adrenoceptor binding. Binding was saturable and specific; a single low affinity site (Kd = 750 pM) was identified. [125I]Cyanopindolol binding was displaced by micromolar concentrations of classic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and by sodium-4-[-2-[2-hydroxy-2-(-3-chloro-phenyl) ethylamino] propyl] phenoxyacetate. These data are similar to reported binding of beta 3-adrenoceptors and may explain beta-adrenoceptor agonist modulation of chromaffin cell degranulation in this catecholamine rich environment.", 
    "69": "OPC-18790 (Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, MD), a novel positive inotropic agent, produces titratable hemodynamic benefits in patients with advanced heart failure. In such patients, OPC-18790 has been shown to acutely increase the cardiac index, while reducing systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular filling pressure, without an associated increase in heart rate. This study was performed to compare the acute hemodynamic effects of OPC-18790 and the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, dobutamine, in patients with advanced heart failure. OPC-18790 and dobutamine were compared on successive days in 13 patients with worsening New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure. The mean (+/- SEM) left ventricular ejection fraction was 15 +/- 2% (range, 6-29%). Pretreatment hemodynamics were: heart rate, 96 +/- 2 beats/min; mean arterial pressure, 77 +/- 3 mmHg; cardiac index, 1.80 +/- 0.10 L/min/m2; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 27 +/- 1 mmHg; mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 41 +/- 2 mmHg; and systemic vascular resistance, 1,732 +/- 152 dynes.s/cm5. At infusion rates yielding comparable increases in the cardiac index (5 micrograms/kg/min for 2 hours for each drug), OPC-18790 produced significantly more favorable effects on heart rate (-2 +/- 3% vs 11 +/- 4%; P = .01), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-32 +/- 4% vs -17 +/- 8%; P = .04), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (-14 +/- 3% vs 6 +/- 11%; P = .06), stroke volume index (48 +/- 8% vs 29 +/- 7%; P = .02), stroke work index (70 +/- 11 vs 42% +/- 12%; P = .03), and rate pressure product (2 +/- 4% vs 14 +/- 4%; P = .05). The hemodynamic profile for OPC-18790 differs from dobutamine, with OPC-18790 exhibiting no increase in heart rate, greater preload reduction, and an increase in cardiac performance at a lower estimated metabolic cost.",

We report the case of a patient with acute, severe muscle weakness and hypokalemia who was diagnosed in the emergency department to have thyrotoxicosis with acute TPP. The hypokalemia was treated aggressively with potassium without effect. After administration of i.v. propranolol, the patient had complete resolution of symptoms, with mild rebound hyperkalemia. The literature on the use of propranolol in TPP is reviewed, and the known pathophysiology of TPP is discussed.", 
    "71": "A 52-yr-old man presented with an evolving myocardial infarction and unstable angina. Previously, he had undergone aortocoronary bypass surgery for triple vessel disease and at that time was diagnosed as hypothyroid. He had been refractory to thyroxine treatment and now required 0.3 mg thyroxine daily. On admission, he was hypertensive, tachycardic and found to be thyrotoxic secondary to excess thyroid hormone ingestion. Treatment with iopanoic acid was started. Despite medical therapy he continued to have unstable angina. Coronary angiography confirmed further triple vessel disease with blockage to his previous grafts. He was taken to surgery for coronary revascularization. On arriving in the intensive care unit he developed a thyroid storm. His temperature increased from 36.5 to 39.5 degrees C requiring a cooling blanket and cold irrigation down a nasogastric tube. An esmolol infusion was started to control his persistent tachycardia but this depressed his myocardial contractility. He required amrinone and noradrenaline infusions as further inotropic support. For sedation and muscle relaxation, intravenous propofol infusion and doxacurium were given. Over the following 20 hr the patient's condition stabilized. In conclusion, we describe the use of a short-acting beta blocker to avoid compromising an impaired myocardium during a thyroid storm which we could stop if the patient's cardiac condition deteriorated. In addition, amrinone, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, was our inotrope of choice as it does not act on the already blocked beta adrenergic system.",

The thromboxane A2-mimic U46619 and endothelin-1 induced a concentration-dependent increment in perfusion pressure, while 5-hydroxytryptamine induced a variable increase, and norepinephrine induced a small, transient increase in perfusion pressure. After preconstriction with U46619, magnesium sulphate (1.5 x 10(-3) to 6 x 10(-3) mol/l) induced a decrease in perfusion pressure, while dihydralazine (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/l) or labetalol (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/l) enhanced the perfusion pressure. These effects of dihydralazine and labetalol were unaffected by treatment with indomethacin 10(-6) mol/l, but could be reversed by addition of magnesium sulphate 6 x 10(-3) mol/l. Labetalol 10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/l also caused an increase in the perfusion pressure induced by endothelin-1, but showed no effects after preconstriction with 5-hydroxytryptamine.

In the above-mentioned compounds the anticalcium effect on the frequency and the amplitude and the negative chronotropic and the negative inotropic effects were evaluated by means of the method of spontaneously pulsing guinea-pig atria within a concentration range of 4-16 microgram.cm-3. The obtained results confirmed a significant anticalcium effect on the heart rate in the compounds with a propoxy and a butoxy group, and in the standard verapamil. In all three compounds as well as in the standard verapamil, no anticalcium effect on the amplitude was found. The results of this membrane efficacy are in agreement with the preceding evaluation of the antidysrhythmic and anti-isoprenaline activity with the most marked effect in the compound with a propoxy group. On the basis of these results it is possible to conclude that in these derivatives of 4-hydroxypropiophenone also the anticalcium effect can participate, besides the beta-adrenolytic and the membranostabilizing effects, in the antidysrhythmic activity.",

The results, analysed on intention-to-treat basis, indicated a reduction in rebleeding (median time to rebleeding 589 days for propanol v. 252 days for placebo; P < 0.02) and increased survival in the propranolol-treated patients (three deaths v. seven deaths on placebo; P < 0.02).

    "79": "Optimal migraine therapy begins with an accurate diagnosis and knowledge of the symptoms that the patient finds most disturbing. Pharmacologic treatment of migraine may be acute (abortive, symptomatic) or preventive (prophylactic); both approaches are frequently required in patients with frequent, severe headaches. Drugs for acute care consist of analgesics, antiemetics, anxiolytics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ergots, steroids, major tranquilizers, narcotics, and selective serotonin agonists. Preventive agents include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, serotonin antagonists, and anticonvulsants. The choice of a preventive drug depends on side effect profiles and comorbid conditions. Behavioral interventions, such as biofeedback and relaxation techniques, are an important complement to pharmacologic therapy; however, drugs are the mainstay of migraine therapy. To ensure that therapy achieves optimal results, the individual patient's preferred approach to this debilitating problem must be considered carefully.", 
    "80": "Electrophysiological techniques were used to study the effects of various serotonin (5-HT) agonists and antagonists on the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of rats. Systemic administration of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (1.25-80 micrograms/kg i.v.) increased the firing rate of the majority (75%) of DA cells studied and stimulated their bursting activity. A subpopulation (25%) of DA neurons was inhibited by 8-OH-DPAT. Selective lesions of 5-HT neurons by the neurotoxin 5-7-dihydroxytryptamine abolished completely the excitatory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on both firing rate and bursting activity of DA neurons. Microiontophoretic application of 8-OH-DPAT into the VTA did not cause any change in the firing rate of DA neurons. Treatment with the selective 5-HT1B agonist CGS 12066B (7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrolo[1,2-a] quinoxaline 1:2 maleate salt) (1.25-160 micrograms/kg i.v.) did not cause any change in basal firing rate of VTA DA cells. Systemic administration of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) (1.25-160 micrograms/kg i.v.) and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) (1.25-320 micrograms/kg i.v.), two mixed 5-HT1B/5-HT1C receptor agonists, significantly reduced the firing rate of all VTA DA neurons studied. The effect of mCPP (maximal inhibition, 40%) was more pronounced compared to that of TFMPP (maximal inhibition, 25%). Microiontophoretic application of mCPP into the VTA caused a marked inhibition of the basal activity of DA neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "Central (i.c.v.) but not peripheral (i.p.) administration of isoproterenol reduced response rates and increased reinforcement rates of rats under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-response-rate 72-sec schedule in a dose-dependent manner. This effect of centrally administered isoproterenol was similar to effects produced by administration of proven antidepressant drugs. Propranolol antagonized the effect of centrally administered isoproterenol, suggesting that the antidepressant-like effect of this agonist was mediated by beta adrenergic receptors. In addition, both the beta-1 selective antagonist betaxolol and the beta-2 selective antagonist ICI 118,551 antagonized the effect of centrally administered isoproterenol in a dose-dependent manner. These antagonists exhibited similar potency, suggesting that both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors were involved in the mediation of the antidepressant-like effect of centrally administered isoproterenol. In rats with down-regulated beta-2 adrenergic receptors, produced by repeated treatment with clenbuterol, isoproterenol still reduced response rates and increased reinforcement rates of rats under the differential-reinforcement-of-low-response-rate schedule. By contrast, the antidepressant-like effect of the beta-2 adrenergic agonist clenbuterol was attenuated by down-regulation of beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The present results indicate that stimulation of central beta adrenergic receptors by intraventricular administration of isoproterenol produces behavioral changes similar to those observed after administration of proven antidepressant drugs. Both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors appear to mediate the antidepressant-like effect of isoproterenol.", 
    "82": "Pro- and antiarrhythmic effects of dl-sotalol and d-sotalol were compared with their electrophysiological actions in an isolated tissue model of simulated ischemia and reperfusion. Microelectrode recordings were made from endo- and epicardium of isolated guinea pig right ventricular free walls. An electrocardiogram also was recorded by two electrodes at opposite ends of the tissue bath. Regular stimulation was delivered to the endocardium. Tissues were exposed to simulated ischemia for 15 min and then were reperfused with normal Tyrode's solution. Arrhythmias with characteristics of transmural reentry occurred in 33% of hearts in ischemia and 73% of hearts in early reperfusion. Arrhythmias were accompanied by prolongation of transmural conduction time (CT) and abbreviation of endocardial action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period. Both dl-sotalol and d-sotalol (100 microM) significantly (P < .05) prolonged endocardial APD, effective refractory period and epicardial APD under preischemic conditions; however, these effects were lost during simulated ischemia and early reperfusion. dl-Sotalol abolished arrhythmias in ischemia and reduced the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias to 30%. This agent attenuated prolongation of transmural CT by ischemia and decreased the incidence of conduction block. In contrast, d-sotalol (100 microM) increased arrhythmias in ischemia to 80% and did not change the incidence of reperfusion arrhythmias (60%). The proarrhythmic effects of d-sotalol were accompanied by prolongation of transmural CT, increased incidence of conduction block and decreased epicardial excitability. Thus, in this model of global ischemia and reperfusion, antiarrhythmic effects were observed with dl-sotalol but not with the predominantly type III isomer, d-sotalol.", 
    "83": "Various chiral stationary phases were investigated in sub- and supercritical fluid chromatography for the separation, without derivatization, of basic (beta-blockers, benzodiazepines) and acidic (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta-agonists) pharmaca. For all racemates, baseline separation was achieved within short analysis times. For several solutes, the high resolution obtained allowed injection of milligram amounts and semipreparative collection of the enantiomers. The parameters affecting enantioselectivity (column efficiency, influence of modifiers and basic or acidic additives, and temperature) have been studied. Enantiomerization of 3-OH-benzodiazepines could be suppressed by working at low temperatures or by using acetonitrile as a comodifier. Serial coupling of different chiral stationary phase columns resulted in a column triplet (Chiralpak AD, an amylose derivative; Chiralcel OD, a cellulose derivative; and Chirex 3022, a Brush-type with pi-donor characteristics) on which all solutes investigated could be baseline separated.",

The SFC of some of these compounds was possible with simple CO(2)-methanol based mobile phases, but in general, it proved to be necessary to add triethylamine as a competing base in order to obtain acceptable peak shapes. The best chromatographic results were obtained on the aminopropyl bonded phase, with good results also seen on the Diol phase. Different selectivities were observed for the Diol and aminopropyl columns.", 
    "85": "beta Adrenoceptor blockade is known to accelerate transit through the small intestine without changing either the number or pattern of intestinal contractions. This study therefore tested the hypothesis that an increase in intraluminal aboral propulsive force may contribute to this transit acceleration. Twenty paired studies were performed, in 10 healthy volunteers, after oral administration of either 100 mg atenolol (a selective beta 1 antagonist) or matched dummy tablets according to a double blind, randomised protocol. The frequency of occurrence of, and the propulsive force exerted by, traction events related to intestinal contractions were measured, using a combined traction force detector and manometry assembly. After atenolol, a consistent increase in the force generated per traction event was noted, both for propagating contractions mean (SEM) (12.0 (1.8) g v control 5.9 (0.07) g; p < 0.05) and for stationary (11.6 (1.4) g v control 7.0 (0.7) g; p < 0.05). In contrast no change in the number of traction events was noted (control v atenolol = 1.6 (0.3) v 1.64 (0.4) per min for propagating and 0.7 (0.1) v 0.85 (0.16) per min for stationary contraction; p > 0.05). beta Adrenoceptor blockade thus increases the propulsive force generated by intestinal contractions, possibly by removing a sympathetic neural inhibition of intestinal tone.",

    "93": "The alpha 1-adrenergic response was predominant over the beta-adrenergic one in adult rat hepatocytes, when the responses were measured as the agonist-induced generations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and cyclic AMP, respectively. During primary culture of the adult rat hepatocytes, the beta-adrenergic response developed rapidly, whereas the alpha 1-response decreased gradually. Such receptor-subtype switching did not occur unless the cells were cultured under conditions favourable for cell growth, i.e. at low cell density (10(4) cells/cm2). The switching was prevented progressively as the cell culture density was increased up to 20-fold or the low-density culture was achieved by addition of increasing amounts of liver plasma membranes. The gradual decrease in alpha 1-response was accounted for by a concurrent decrease in the receptor site density, whereas rapid development of the beta-response definitely preceded the increase in beta-ligand binding sites during the culture. This rapid development of the beta-response reflected enhanced coupling of the receptor to G-protein during the early stage of culture, as evidenced by the progressively developed ability of GTP to lower the affinity of beta-agonist binding to membranes prepared from these short-time-cultured hepatocytes.", 
    "94": "The possible significance of the coexisting beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenoceptors in brown adipose tissue for the thermogenic response was investigated. Oxygen consumption of isolated hamster brown fat cells was analyzed as a measure of thermogenesis. Thermogenesis could be evoked not only by the physiological agent norepinephrine but also by BRL-37344 and CGP-12177. No evidence for biphasic inhibition curves was found with either the selective beta 1-antagonist ICI-89406, the beta 2-antagonist ICI-118551, or the beta 1/beta 2-nonselective beta-antagonist propranolol against 1 microM norepinephrine; pI50 (the negative logarithm of the inhibitory constant for an antagonist, as estimated from the dose-response curve for an antagonist vs. a constant agonist concentration) values for ICI-89406 and ICI-118551 were very low (4-5), implying nonselective inhibition; the pI50 for propranolol was approximately 6 (as expected for the beta 3-receptor). Even with suboptimal norepinephrine, no biphasic inhibition was found. CGP-12177 at concentrations where it is primarily an antagonist to the beta 1-receptor did not influence the dose-response curve for either norepinephrine or BRL-37344. BRL-37344- or CGP-12177-induced thermogenesis was inhibited by the beta-antagonists in a manner similar to norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis. Schild plots for propranolol inhibition of norepinephrine-, isoprenaline-, BRL-37344- and CGP-12177-induced thermogenesis yielded similar pA2 (the negative logarithm of the inhibitory constant for an antagonist, as calculated from a series of agonist dose-response curves at different antagonist concentrations) (approximately 5.5), for interaction with either agonist, implying that the same receptor was stimulated by all agonists. Thus, despite the fact that different beta-receptor subtypes coexist in the tissue, we find no evidence for the participation of beta 1- or beta 2-receptors in the thermogenic response. Within the resolution of the experiments, the results therefore imply that it is predominantly or solely the beta 3-receptor that is coupled to thermogenesis, and it is via this beta-adrenergic receptor that not only norepinephrine but also CGP-12177 and BRL-37344 induce thermogenesis.",

    "108": "Specific receptor binding was 75% of the total uptake in the heart, preventable and displaceable by propranolol. Dose-dependent competition showed that carazolol binds in vivo to beta 1 and to beta 2 subtypes. Uptake of the labeled R(+) enantiomer of carazolol was not receptor-specific.", 
    "109": "Carazolol labeled with 11C or 18F is a strong candidate for use in receptor estimation with PET. The in vivo observations were consistent with its known high affinity and slow receptor dissociation rate. Its high specific receptor uptake and low metabolism allow existing kinetic models to be applied for receptor measurements. The 11C label is convenient for repeated administrations, though 18F allowed the long observation periods necessary for measurement of the receptor dissociation rate. If needed, nonspecific uptake can be estimated without pharmacologic intervention by using the labeled R enantiomer.", 
    "110": "Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to examine the regulation of voltage-dependent calcium channels by mu- and kappa-opioid receptors in acutely isolated rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. Agonists selective for either mu- (Tyr-Pro-NMePhe-D-Pro-NH2, PLO17) or kappa-opioid receptors (dynorphin A, U69,593) inhibited high-threshold calcium currents in a reversible and naloxone-sensitive manner, whereas administration of D-Pen2,5-enkephalin, a delta-selective agonist, was without effect. However, none of the opioids reduced low-threshold T-type currents. The inhibitory effects of PLO17 were blocked by the irreversible mu-opioid antagonist beta-funaltrexamine but not the kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine, while responses to kappa-opioid agonists showed the opposite pattern of antagonist sensitivity. In addition, many cells responded to both PLO17 and dynorphin A (or U69,593), and in these neurons the inhibitory response to one agonist was occluded when tested in the presence of the other. These data suggest that mu- and kappa-opioid receptors are coexpressed on at least some DRG neurons and appear to be functionally coupled to a common pool of calcium channels. Both rapidly inactivating (transient) and sustained components of high-threshold current, arising from pharmacologically distinct types of calcium channels, were identified in our neurons. Activation of mu-opioid receptors selectively reduced the transient component of currents evoked at +10 mV from Vh = -80 mV, while sparing the sustained component. The transient component was irreversibly blocked by the N-type channel antagonist omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx), and in one-half of the neurons there was a concomitant loss of the response to PLO17. In the remaining neurons, PLO17 continued to reduce a small fraction of omega-CgTx-insensitive current and subsequent administration of the L-type channel blocker nifedipine in saturating concentrations failed to reduce the opioid-induced inhibitory effect. These data demonstrate that mu-opioid receptors are negatively coupled to several pharmacologically distinct types of calcium channels in DRG sensory neurons, one that was blocked by omega-CgTx and thus likely to be N-type, and a second that was resistant to blockade by N- and L-type channel blockers.", 
    "111": "Exposure of human SK-N-MC neurotumor cells to 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased isoproterenol stimulation of cyclic AMP levels by severalfold. This potentiation was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and did not occur in cells in which PKC had been down-regulated. PMA treatment also enhanced the stimulation by dopamine, cholera toxin, and forskolin. Thus, the effect of PMA on the adenylylcyclase system was postreceptor and involved either the guanine nucleotide binding regulatory (G) proteins or the cyclase itself. As PMA treatment did not impair the inhibition of isoproterenol stimulation by neuropeptide Y, an involvement of the inhibitory G protein Gi was unlikely. Cholate extracts of membranes from control and PMA-treated cells were equally effective in the reconstitution of adenylylcyclase activity in S49 cyc- membranes, which lack the stimulatory G protein subunit Gs alpha; thus, Gs did not appear to be the target of PMA action. Membranes from PMA-treated cells exhibited increased adenylylcyclase activity to all stimulators including Mn2+ and Mn2+ plus forskolin. In addition, activity was increased when control membranes were incubated with ATP and purified PKC from rat brain. This is consistent with a direct effect of PKC on the adenylylcyclase catalyst in SK-N-MC cells. PMA treatment also resulted in a shift to less sensitivity in the K(act) for isoproterenol but not for dopamine or CGP-12177 (a beta 3-adrenergic agonist) stimulation. Thus, the beta 1 but not the D1 or beta 3 receptors were being desensitized by PKC activation. Analysis of SK-N-MC cells by western blotting with antibodies against different PKC isozymes revealed that both the alpha and zeta isozymes were present in these cells. Whereas PKC-alpha was activated and translocated from cytosol to membrane by phorbol esters, the zeta isozyme was not. Thus, PKC-alpha, which has been implicated in desensitization in other cell lines, also appears to potentiate adenylylcyclase activity.",

Five-minute electrocardiographic recordings were obtained in triplicate after physiologic and pharmacologic sympathetic stimulation: during upright tilt, after maximal exercise, during epinephrine and isoproterenol infusions at 50 ng/kg body weight per min, during beta-adrenergic blockade and during combined beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade.", 
    "115": "Beta-adrenergic stimulation resulted in a significant decrease in time domain measures of heart rate variability. The frequency domain indexes showed variable responses, depending on the individual stimulus. Tilt caused an increase in low frequency power and in the ratio of low to high frequency power. These changes were not necessarily observed with other conditions of beta-adrenergic stimulation. Double blockade suppressed baseline heart rate variability, but beta-adrenergic blockade had no significant effect. Time domain measures of heart rate variability demonstrated excellent reproducibility over the three recordings, but the frequency domain variables demonstrated fair to excellent reproducibility.", 
    "116": "These findings suggest that different modes of beta-adrenergic stimulation may result in divergent heart rate variability responses. Thus, current heart rate variability techniques cannot be used as general indexes of \"sympathetic\" tone. Studies utilizing heart rate variability to quantify sympathetic tone need to consider this.", 
    "117": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) is a peptide growth factor that may play a role in the myocardial response to hypertrophic stimuli. However, the cellular distribution, mechanism of induction, and source of increased TGF-beta 1 in response to hypertrophic stimuli are not known. We tested the hypothesis that the cardiac myocyte responds to hypertrophic stimuli with the increased expression of TGF-beta 1. In adult rat ventricular myocardium freshly dissociated into myocyte and nonmyocyte cellular fractions, the preponderance of TGF-beta 1 mRNA visualized by Northern hybridization was in the nonmyocyte fraction. Abdominal aortic constriction (7 d) and subcutaneous norepinephrine infusion (36 h) each caused ventricular hypertrophy associated with 3.1-fold and 3.8-fold increases, respectively, in TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the myocyte fraction, but had no effect on the level of TGF-beta 1 mRNA in the nonmyocyte fraction. In ventricular myocytes, norepinephrine likewise caused a 4.1-fold increase in TGF-beta 1 mRNA associated with an increase in TGF-beta bioactivity. This induction of TGF-beta 1 mRNA occurred at norepinephrine concentrations as low as 1 nM and was blocked by prazosin, but not propranolol. NE did not increase the TGF-beta 1 mRNA level in nonmyocytes, primarily fibroblasts, cultured from neonatal rat ventricle. Thus, the cardiac myocyte responds to two hypertrophic stimuli, pressure overload and norepinephrine, with the induction of TGF-beta 1. These data support the view that TGF-beta 1, released by myocytes and acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner, is involved in myocardial remodeling by hypertrophic stimuli.",

    "119": "Three aspects of the exercise-IOP relationship were studied. These included graded exercise, with and without CO2 addition for isocapnia; comparison of the IOP response of trained and sedentary subjects to a fixed external work load; and exercise after ocular beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Graded exercise consisted of 7 minutes each at 30 and 90 watts on a cycle ergometer, then progressive work to exhaustion. Trained and sedentary subjects were defined on the basis of the blood lactate response to fixed external work (10 minutes at 90 watts). Selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade (betaxolol) and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade (levobunolol) were superimposed on graded exercise. Intraocular pressure was measured using applanation tonometry.", 
    "120": "Graded exercise: Intraocular pressure decreased in proportion to exercise intensity. Hypocapnia developed in the last minutes of exhausting work, but preventing hypocapnia with CO2 addition failed to lessen the decrease in IOP. Response to fixed external work load: Intraocular pressure decreased significantly more in sedentary than in trained subjects; this decline was correlated with elevations in blood lactate but not with changes in metabolic rate or plasma osmolarity. Selective and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade: Both drugs lowered IOP at baseline and throughout graded exercise; the drugs and exercise had apparently additive ocular hypotensive effects.", 
    "121": "Acute dynamic exercise lowers IOP in a graded fashion proportional to relative, not absolute, work load. The IOP decline is correlated with blood lactate but not with PCO2 or plasma osmolarity changes, and exercise potentiates the ocular hypotensive effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "122": "We have investigated the messenger RNAs expressed from the three calmodulin genes during rat liver regeneration. The results revealed that all the calmodulin transcripts increased from 8 hr after a partial hepatectomy, although differences in the timing and the level of expression from the three genes were observed. Calmodulin I transcripts peaked at 16 hr, whereas calmodulin II and calmodulin III progressively increased from 8 to 24 hr. At 24 hr after surgery, calmodulin I, calmodulin II and the 2.3 kb calmodulin III transcripts reached values of a 6-fold increase, whereas the 0.8 kb product of calmodulin III increased 25-fold. At 30 hr the levels of all the calmodulin transcripts were similar to those observed at 24 hr. The transcription rates of the three calmodulin genes augmented after hepatectomy (calmodulin I and calmodulin II twofold and calmodulin III fourfold), indicating that the elevation of the calmodulin transcripts could be, at least partially, the result of this increase in the transcription rates. The total calmodulin concentration also increased twofold at 24 hr after hepatectomy. We also report that the administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker, D,L-propranolol inhibited the accumulation of calmodulin protein without significantly affecting the increase of the messenger RNAs. These results indicate that the expression of calmodulin observed during liver regeneration could be regulated by cyclic AMP at the translational or posttranslational level.",

Modes of mechanical ventilation included controlled mechanical ventilation, high-frequency oscillation, synchronized high-frequency jet ventilation, and external negative pressure oscillation combined with pressure support ventilation. Each mode of respiratory support was randomly and sequentially applied to each animal with the assessment of cardiopulmonary function at the end of each period.", 
    "128": "Continuous monitoring included electrocardiogram, right atrial, left ventricular end-diastolic, pulmonary arterial, intrathoracic aortic, arterial, esophageal, and transpulmonary pressures and arterial and mixed venous oxygen saturation measurements. In addition, cardiac output using the thermodilution technique was measured intermittently. Whereas in the control period cardiac index was significantly (p < .05) higher during synchronized high-frequency jet ventilation (193 +/- 19.3 mL/kg/min) than during controlled mechanical ventilation (151 +/- 12.1 mL/kg/min) and high-frequency oscillation (151 +/- 18.1 mL/kg/min), there was no significant hemodynamic difference between the four modes of mechanical ventilation in the cardiac and pulmonary failure periods. In the pulmonary failure period, transpulmonary pressure was significantly higher during high-frequency oscillation (7.1 +/- 1.6 mm Hg) than during controlled mechanical ventilation (5.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg), high-frequency ventilation (4.1 +/- 0.4 mm Hg), and external negative pressure oscillation combined with pressure support ventilation (5.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg).",

No hemodynamic difference is present between the four modes of mechanical ventilation in the cardiac and pulmonary failure periods.

There has been an increased interest in the use of class III drugs to treat AF, and several new agents have been developed, but there is little information available about mechanisms of class III drug action in AF. The present study was designed to compare the effects of two class III agents, d-sotalol and ambasilide, in dog models of experimental AF.", 
    "131": "A previously developed dog model of sustained vagotonic AF was used to assess the ability of equal loading doses of d-sotalol and ambasilide (2 mg/kg, followed by maintenance infusions), to terminate AF and prevent its induction. At this dose, ambasilide terminated AF in 12 of 12 dogs and prevented AF induction in 10 of 12 dogs; d-sotalol terminated AF in 1 of 8 dogs (P = .001 versus ambasilide) and prevented AF induction in none of 8 dogs (P = .002). An additional dose of d-sotalol (cumulative load, 8 mg/kg) terminated AF in 7 of 8 dogs and prevented induction in 5 of 8 dogs. In an additional 6 dogs with sterile pericarditis and inducible AF, ambasilide prevented AF induction in all 6. An equal dose of d-sotalol (2 mg/kg) failed to suppress AF induction in any dog, but 8 mg/kg of d-sotalol suppressed AF induction in all. Atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was increased by both drugs. However, the effects of d-sotalol on AERP showed strong reverse use dependence, whereas those of ambasilide did not. Neither ambasilide nor d-sotalol significantly altered conduction velocity, and both increased ventricular refractoriness, with d-sotalol once again showing more reverse use dependence. Effective doses of both agents increased AERP and the wavelength for atrial reentry at rapid rates, slowing atrial activation and terminating the arrhythmia.", 
    "132": "The class III drugs d-sotalol and ambasilide terminate AF by increasing AERP and the wavelength for reentry. Ambasilide, which has been reported to block both the rapid and slow components of the delayed rectifier (IKr and IKs), shows less reverse use dependence of effects on refractoriness than the pure IKr blocker d-sotalol, possibly explaining the greater effectiveness of ambasilide at an equal dose level. These results indicate that class III drugs can exhibit different profiles of rate-dependent action on AERP and suggest that it may be possible to develop agents that have more desirable rate-dependent profiles than pure blockers of Ikr.",

    "134": "Atrial pacing at 20-millisecond increments decreasing stepwise was performed, and the curves that relate the AH interval to the atrial pacing cycle length were analyzed. The change in AV nodal function was evaluated in three protocols: (1) In 8 group 1A and 6 group 1B patients, an intravenous infusion of adenosine at a dose of 140 and 320 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 was given, respectively; (2) a bolus injection of a fixed dose of adenosine was given to 12 group 2A patients without and 6 group 2B patients with propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) treatment; and (3) in 12 group 3 patients, the AV nodal function was evaluated after intravenous propranolol (0.05 mg/kg) and after subsequent intravenous aminophylline (loading dose, 5 mg/kg; maintenance dose, 0.9 mg.kg-1.h-1). No significant depression of AV nodal function could be demonstrated during intravenous infusion of adenosine. The bolus injection of adenosine could prolong the AH interval, which was dependent on heart rate and more significant at a shorter pacing cycle length. Intravenous propranolol significantly depressed the AV nodal conduction and shifted the curves of the AH interval versus the pacing cycle length to the right. Subsequent intravenous aminophylline shortened the AV nodal conduction time, however, in a rate-independent manner.",

While these patients served as their own controls, an additional population of patients with heart failure was followed for a similar time period on traditional medications. A panel of seven delayed hypersensitivity skin tests were placed at 6- to 12-month intervals on the patient's forearm. Seventy percent of all CHF patients were anergic (unable to respond to more than 1 antigen). The 30% who could respond averaged 2.2 antigens. After treatment with metoprolol, only 20% remained anergic (P < .001). The 80% of responders averaged 4.2 antigens (P < .001). Additionally, patients treated with metoprolol had an increased percentage of T cells, natural killer cells, and increased interleukin-2 receptor density upon stimulation with concanavalin A. These changes correlated to increases in ejection fraction. Patients not treated with metoprolol remained anergic and had no beneficial immunologic changes.",

Patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III (95%) or IV (5%) at inclusion. All received background diuretic and vasodilator therapy (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in 90% of cases). A total of 320 patients was randomized to bisoprolol and 321 to placebo. Mean follow-up was 1.9 years. Bisoprolol was well tolerated without between group difference in premature treatment withdrawals (82 on placebo, 75 on bisoprolol; NS). The observed difference in mortality between groups did not reach statistical significance: 67 patients died on placebo, 53 on bisoprolol (P = .22; relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.15). No significant difference was observed in sudden death rate (17 on placebo, 15 on bisoprolol) or death related to documented ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (7 on placebo, 4 on bisoprolol). Bisoprolol significantly improved the functional status of the patients; fewer patients in the bisoprolol group required hospitalization for cardiac decompensation (90 on placebo versus 61 on bisoprolol, P < .01), and more patients improved by at least one New York Heart Association functional class (48 on placebo versus 68 on bisoprolol, P = .04) by the end of follow-up period.",

Besides the thrombolysis-induced myocardial salvage, there is increasing evidence that an open infarct-related artery results in increased electrical stability of the heart and that this effect is at least in part responsible for the favorable long-term outcome of these patients. The exact incidence of arrhythmic events during the first year after myocardial infarction and the predictive value of different risk factors for these complications, however, have not been determined in patients in the thrombolytic era.",

At the time of hospital discharge, signal-averaged ECG, Holter monitoring, radionuclide angiography, coronary angiography, and levocardiography were performed in all patients. An open infarct-related artery was documented in 136 patients. The overall incidence of late potentials was 24% (41 patients). By multivariate analysis, an occluded infarct-related artery (P = .04) and the presence of regional wall motion abnormalities (P = .02) were the strongest independent predictors for the development of a late potential. Residual ischemia was treated by either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or surgery in 86 of 173 patients (50%). Seventy percent of the patients received beta-blocker therapy. During a mean follow-up of 12 +/- 5 months, 7 patients died suddenly or had ventricular fibrillation documented, while only 2 developed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Overall 1-year mortality was 4.1%. Multivariate analysis revealed only an occluded infarct-related artery as an independent predictor of arrhythmic complications (P = .017).",

The presence or absence of an open infarct-related artery was the strongest independent predictor of these events, whereas other traditional risk factors, such as late potentials, were less helpful in identifying patients prone to sudden death. These findings emphasize the importance of the open artery hypothesis in patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "145": "Our goal was to better understand the mechanisms underlying muscarinic receptor actions on the ventricle in vivo. Therefore, we studied the effects of vagal stimulation on ventricular repolarization and of vagal tone on lethal arrhythmias induced by 30 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery ligation in anesthetized cats. Experimental groups included normal control cats subjected only to coronary ligation and cats pretreated with atropine, pertussis toxin (PTX), or propranolol. All cats received bilateral cervical vagal stimulation (Vstim) at 1, 3, and 5 Hz for 1 minute at 10-minute intervals. Before coronary ligation, Vstim slowed sinus rate, prolonged the PR interval, and lowered blood pressure. Most important from the point of view of electrophysiological function was a vagally induced acceleration of ventricular repolarization in paced and unpaced hearts, which could be explained by the effects of acetylcholine (ie, shortening the subepicardial muscle action potentials). The effect on repolarization was blocked by atropine or PTX but not by propranolol. The extent of sinus slowing and acceleration of repolarization was directly related to the level of functional PTX-sensitive G protein (P < .05). Coronary occlusion was performed during atrial pacing such that the heart rate in all groups was equal. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 10% in the control group and 50% and 54% in atropine and PTX groups, respectively (P < .05). During atrial pacing before coronary occlusion, a vagal index was calculated as percent QTc shortening during Vstim. When the vagal index was 13% to 26%, the incidence of VF during occlusion was zero. When the vagal index was 0% to 12%, VF was 52% (P < .01). Conclusions are as follows: (1) Vstim accelerates ventricular repolarization in cats via a pathway that incorporates a PTX-sensitive G protein and involves an altered gradient between epicardium and endocardium. (2) Removal of vagal tone during ischemia favors VF, as predicted by a vagal index.",

Catheters was placed in the left radial artery and in the bulb of the right internal jugular vein, respectively. Baseline CBF was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography scanning; concomitantly, blood samples were drawn for calculation of the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference. Then changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) were induced, and relative changes in global CBF were calculated according to Fick's principle assuming a constant cerebral oxygen metabolism. MAP was increased 30 mm Hg by norepinephrine infusion and was decreased by lower body negative pressure.

A significant correlation between Vmean and relative changes in global CBF was demonstrated below the lower limit of autoregulation (R2 = .73, P < .001; CBF = -6.3 + 1.0.Vmean).

    "150": "The impact of physico-chemical properties of 25 compounds, including antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory and beta-blocking drugs, on their determination by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MECC) with direct serum injection (DSI) is discussed. Having a pH 9.2 buffer containing 75 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), elution is dependent on hydrophobicity, the order of emergence being basically according to increasing octanol/water partition coefficients (logP values). Peak shape is determined by the dissociation behavior (expressed by pKa) and plasma protein binding (PPB). Sharp peaks are produced by compounds having low PPB and, independently of PPB, by drugs with pKa values which are similar to the buffer pH. Broad or double peaks are established by drugs of low pKa values and significant (> about 40%) PPB. In order to evaluate the effective amount of a protein-bound drug measured by MECC-DSI, serum levels of drugs with different PPB, namely ethosuximide (no PPB), phenobarbital (PPB of about 50%) and naproxen (PPB > 99%) have been determined by both MECC-DSI and MECC with extract injection (MECC-EXI). In each case, with more than 40 sera, there is good agreement between the two sets of data. Thus, employing MECC-DSI, total amounts of drugs are determined, i.e. a complete release of the drugs from the proteins is effected by the impact of dodecyl sulfate on the sampled proteins.", 
    "151": "Bathing hippocampal slices in the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), while stimulating the Schaffer collaterals at a low frequency, induces Ca(2+)-dependent, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (LTPk) in CA1 neurons. We have combined ratio imaging of fura-2 and mag-fura-5 in hippocampal CA1 neurons with intracellular and field recordings to evaluate postsynaptic Ca2+ changes that occur in the induction of LTPk. Test stimuli were applied at 0.05 Hz to stratum radiatum in the presence of the NMDA receptor antagonists D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (100 microM) or MK-801 (10 microM). During TEA exposure (15-25 mM; 10 min), cells fired prolonged action potentials both spontaneously and in response to test stimuli resulting in transient, micromolar Ca2+ accumulations in both somata and dendrites. The initial EPSP slope, measured 60 min after TEA wash-out, was potentiated to approximately 200% of control. The Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine (10 microM) greatly reduced Ca2+ transients in both magnitude and duration and prevented LTPk induction. Pretreatment of slices with compounds that block metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (L-AP3, 50-200 microM) or L-aspartate-beta-hydroxamate (50-100 microM), as well as protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (sphingosine, 20 microM; RO-31-8220, 0.2 microM; or calphostin C, 2 microM) also blocked LTPk. Ca2+ transients were unaffected by L-AP3 or RO-31-8220. These findings suggest that Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated channels and co-activation of PKC by mGluRs are both necessary for induction of LTPk. Activation of mGluRs must also occur in NMDA receptor-dependent induction paradigms, but is possibly of lesser importance owing to the much greater gating of Ca2+ directly into the dendritic spines.", 
    "152": "Six potential plasticizers for an ethylcellulose (EC) pseudolatex coating system (Aquacoat) were evaluated at three levels (25, 30, and 35%) to study the influence of these additives on the release of a model compound, propranolol hydrochloride, from pellets in two different media, dilute HCl and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For the majority of the plasticizers, the release rate decreased when larger amounts of plasticizer were incorporated into the coating. However, for the plasticizers dibutyl sebacate and dibutyl adipate, no further reduction in the release rate was observed following dissolution testing in dilute HCl when the level of plasticizer was increased from 30 to 35%. This suggests that the saturation capacity of these plasticizers in the film coating had been exceeded. The media pH was found to influence the dissolution characteristics of the coatings. Faster release rates as well as earlier curve inflection points and T50% values were observed for plasticizers evaluated in phosphate buffer. All plasticizers used were independent of pH. Correlation of the dissolution results with properties of free films indicated that slower release (more complete film formation) is associated with softer and weaker films with greater elongation.", 
    "153": "The effects of administration of pressor agent phenylephrine (PE) and depressor agent, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (10-40 micrograms/kg) on arterial blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate (HR) were investigated during acute occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in anaesthetized, artificially ventilated dogs with and without the influence of selective blockade of autonomic nervous system (ANS). ABP response to PE was significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated following 4 hrs of LAD occlusion in all the four groups of animals. SNP response at higher dose (40 micrograms/kg) was also significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated 4 hrs after LAD occlusion in ANS intact, beta-blocked and atropinized groups. The bradycardia response to PE after LAD occlusion was abolished in vagotomized group while in the other three groups, it was significantly attenuated following 4 hrs of LAD occlusion. The tachycardia response to SNP was significantly (P < 0.05) attenuated 4 hrs after LAD occlusion in ANS intact and atropinized animals. The response was abolished in beta-blocked animals and no significant change occurred (P > 0.05) in vagotomized group. This study suggests that the cardiovascular reflex effects of PE and SNP are significantly attenuated following acute LAD occlusion. Blocking any of the components of ANS changed this responsiveness.", 
    "154": "It has been previously shown that responsiveness to noradrenaline is reduced in brown adipocytes isolated from estradiol-treated rats. The possibility that high plasma levels of progesterone could also alter adrenergic response was checked. The oxygen consumption of brown adipocytes isolated from control and progesterone-treated rats was monitored in basal conditions and in the presence of increasing concentrations of noradrenaline. In both situations, cells isolated from treated animals showed a lower respiratory rate than those from control animals. These results suggest that not only estradiol but also progesterone could modulate the adrenergic response of brown adipocytes. The study of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic responses indicates that the beta-response parallels the general reduction in oxygen consumption, although the alpha 1-response seems to be more deeply depressed. Estimation of cell number in brown fat depots indicates some hyperplasia induced by progesterone; this increase in cell number could counterbalance partially but not totally the decreased cellular oxygen consumption at the organ level.", 
    "155": "Impaired sexual functioning limits the quality of life of 34-75% of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients. This study examined the effects of three factors: (a) beta-blocker intake, (b) psychological distress, and (c) information about safety of sexual activity, on post-MI decreased sexual functioning. Sixty-three male post-MI, post-cardiac rehabilitation patients and their spouses participated in the study. Analyses of partial variance were conducted to test for the effect of each factor on sexual functioning. Controlling for age, results revealed that patients' psychological distress explained uniquely 24% of the variance on decreased post-MI sexual activity (p < 0.002). Beta-blocker intake and message received with regard to sexual activity safety were not significant predictors of observed changes. Interdisciplinary assessments and interventions are recommended.", 
    "156": "AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) usually involves anterograde conduction over a slowly conducting (\"slow\") pathway and retrograde conduction over a rapidly conducting (\"fast\") pathway. A variety of drugs, such as beta blockers, digitalis, and calcium channel blockers, have been reported to prolong AV nodal refractoriness in both the anterograde and retrograde limbs of the circuit. However, few data are available that address whether the fast and slow pathways respond in a quantitatively different manner to drugs such as beta-adrenergic antagonists. In addition, it is not known whether the effects of these agents on refractoriness parallel the effects on conduction in the fast and slow pathways. The present study was performed to measure the effect of the intravenous beta-adrenergic agent, esmolol, on refractoriness and conduction in both the fast and slow AV nodal pathways in patients with AVNRT.", 
    "157": "Thirteen patients with discontinuous AV nodal conduction properties and typical AVNRT were studied. Anterograde and retrograde AV nodal functional assessment was performed at baseline and following steady-state drug infusion of intravenous esmolol at a dose of 500 micrograms/kg for 1 minute, 150 micrograms/kg per minute for the next 4 minutes, followed by a continuous maintenance infusion of 50 to 100 micrograms/kg per minute. The anterograde effective refractory period of the fast pathway increased from 381 +/- 75 msec at baseline to 453 +/- 92 msec during the infusion of esmolol (P = 0.003). The anterograde effective refractory period of the slow pathway was also prolonged by esmolol, from 289 +/- 26 msec to 310 +/- 17 msec (P = 0.005). However, the absolute magnitude of the change in the anterograde effective refractory period of the fast pathway (+72 +/- 59 msec) was significantly greater than the change in anterograde effective refractory period of the slow pathway (+21 +/- 16 msec, P = 0.01). The mean retrograde effective refractory period of the fast pathway increased from 276 +/- 46 msec to 376 +/- 61 msec during esmolol infusion (P = 0.03). Retrograde slow pathway conduction that could not be demonstrated at baseline became manifest in three patients during esmolol infusion. In contrast to the effects of esmolol on refractoriness, the AH interval during anterograde slow pathway conduction prolonged to a far greater extent (+84 msec) than the HA interval associated with retrograde fast pathway conduction (+5 msec, P = 0.04).", 
    "158": "The beta-adrenergic antagonist, esmolol, has a quantitatively greater effect on anterograde refractoriness of the fast than the slow AV nodal pathway. However, the effects on conduction intervals during AVNRT are greater in the anterograde slow pathway than in the retrograde fast pathway. These observations suggest that the fast and slow pathways may have differential sensitivities to autonomic influences. This difference in the response to beta-adrenergic antagonists may be exploited as a clinically useful method for demonstrating slow pathway conduction in some individuals with AVNRT."
