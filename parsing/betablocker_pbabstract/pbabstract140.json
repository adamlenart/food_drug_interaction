Although clinical trials have shown that implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are effective in improving survival in a variety of populations, dialysis patients have been routinely excluded from these analyses. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of ICD therapy in patients receiving dialysis. Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for pertinent studies published from 1999 to 2008. In addition, hand searches of the relevant annual scientific sessions and major scientific meetings in North America and Europe from 2000 to 2008 were performed. All clinical reports describing outcomes of ICD therapy in relation to renal function were eligible. Four investigators independently extracted the data in a standardized manner. Seven studies were identified, with a total of 2,516 patients and 89 patients receiving dialysis. Despite having ICDs, patients receiving dialysis had a 2.7-fold higher mortality compared with those not receiving dialysis. The results were similar in fixed- and random-effects models. Comparing patients receiving dialysis and those with chronic kidney disease but not receiving dialysis, there was no significant difference in mortality (risk ratio 1.62, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 3.14). No evidence of publication bias was found. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that even in those with ICDs, there is still a 2.7-fold increased mortality risk in patients who receive dialysis compared with those who do not. Beta blockers may be less cardioprotective in patients with ICDs who are on dialysis.",

AA is then further metabolized into terminal signaling molecules including numerous prostaglandins. We have now demonstrated the involvement of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase 1 (PAP-1) and protein kinase C (PKC) in the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) activation of GIVA PLA(2). We also studied the effect of PAP-1 and PKC on Ca+2 induced and synergy enhanced GIVA PLA(2) activation. We observed that the AA release induced by exposure of RAW 264.7 macrophages to the TLR-4 specific agonist Kdo(2)-Lipid A is blocked by the PAP-1 inhibitors bromoenol lactone (BEL) and propranolol as well as the PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220; however these inhibitors did not reduce AA release stimulated by Ca+2 influx induced by the P2X7 purinergic receptor agonist ATP. Additionally, stimulation of cells with diacylglycerol (DAG), the product of PAP-1 mediated hydrolysis, initiated AA release from unstimulated cells as well as restored normal AA release from cells treated with PAP-1 inhibitors. Finally, neither PAP-1 nor PKC inhibition reduced GIVA PLA(2) synergistic activation by stimulation with Kdo(2)-Lipid A and ATP.",

The median heart rate for the prospective group was significantly lower (66 versus 77 beats/minute; p=0.0007). The composite cardiac complication rate was 2% in the prospective group versus 10% in the retrospective group (p=0.02). There were no deaths.

    "7": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials was undertaken to assess the effects of beta-2 receptor antagonists in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Database and reference list searches were performed to identify eligible studies. Outcome data were extracted on functional status, as measured by the grip test or neurological severity score (NSS), and cerebral edema, as measured by brain water content (BWC). Data were pooled using the random-effects model. Seventeen controlled trials involving 817 animals were identified. Overall methodological quality was poor. Results from the grip test suggest that the treatment group maintained grip for a longer period than the control group; pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) = 8.28 (95% CI 5.78-10.78). The treatment group was found to have a lower NSS (i.e., better neurological function); pooled WMD =-3.28 (95% CI -4.72 to -1.85). Analysis of the cerebral edema data showed that the treatment group had a lower BWC than the control; pooled WMD =-0.42 (95% CI -0.59 to -0.26). There was evidence of statistical heterogeneity between comparisons for all outcomes. Evidence for small study effects was found for the grip test and BWC outcomes. The evidence from animal models of TBI suggests that beta-2 receptor antagonists can improve functional outcome and lessen cerebral edema. However, the poor methodological quality of the included studies and presence of small study effects may have influenced these findings.",

Thiazide diuretics, niacin, and beta-adrenergic blockers impair glucose homeostasis. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have demonstrated beneficial metabolic effects. The newer vasodilating beta-blocking agents and calcium antagonists appear to be metabolically neutral. These considerations, in addition to meticulous attention to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, have the potential to beneficially modify glycemia and long-term risks. These considerations have particular importance in younger patients who may also have pre-diabetes or the metabolic syndrome and who are likely to require therapy over the course of decades.",

    "25": "The purpose of the present investigation was to explore the effects of exercise and adrenaline on the mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, in rat abdominal adipose tissue. We hypothesized that (1) exercise training would increase PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in association with increases in mitochondrial marker enzymes, (2) adrenaline would increase PGC-1alpha mRNA expression and (3) the effect of exercise on PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in white adipose tissue would be attenuated by a beta-blocker. Two hours of daily swim training for 4 weeks led to increases in mitochondrial marker proteins and PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in epididymal and retroperitoneal fat depots. Additionally, a single 2 h bout of exercise led to increases in PGC-1alpha mRNA expression immediately following exercise cessation. Adrenaline treatment of adipose tissue organ cultures led to dose-dependent increases in PGC-1alpha mRNA expression. A supra-physiological concentration of adrenaline increased PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in epididymal but not retroperitoneal adipose tissue. beta-Blockade attenuated the effects of an acute bout of exercise on PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in epididymal but not retroperitoneal fat pads. In summary, this is the first investigation to demonstrate that exercise training, an acute bout of exercise and adrenaline all increase PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in rat white adipose tissue. Furthermore it would appear that increases in circulating catecholamine levels may be one potential mechanism mediating exercise induced increases in PGC-1alpha mRNA expression in rat abdominal adipose tissue.", 
    "26": "The large-conductance, voltage-dependent and Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) (BK) channel links membrane depolarization and local increases in cytosolic free Ca(2+) to hyperpolarizing K(+) outward currents, thereby controlling smooth muscle contractility. Constitutive deletion of the BK channel in mice (BK(-/-)) leads to an overactive bladder associated with increased intravesical pressure and frequent micturition, which has been revealed to be a result of detrusor muscle hyperexcitability. Interestingly, time-dependent and smooth muscle-specific deletion of the BK channel (SM-BK(-/-)) caused a more severe phenotype than displayed by constitutive BK(-/-) mice, suggesting that compensatory pathways are active in the latter. In detrusor muscle of BK(-/-) but not SM-BK(-/-) mice, we found reduced L-type Ca(2+) current density and increased expression of cAMP kinase (protein kinase A; PKA), as compared with control mice. Increased expression of PKA in BK(-/-) mice was accompanied by enhanced beta-adrenoceptor/cAMP-mediated suppression of contractions by isoproterenol. This effect was attenuated by about 60-70% in SM-BK(-/-) mice. However, the Rp isomer of adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, a blocker of PKA, only partially inhibited enhanced cAMP signaling in BK(-/-) detrusor muscle, suggesting the existence of additional compensatory pathways. To this end, proteome analysis of BK(-/-) urinary bladder tissue was performed, and revealed additional compensatory regulated proteins. Thus, constitutive and inducible deletion of BK channel activity unmasks compensatory mechanisms that are relevant for urinary bladder relaxation.",

The objective of this study was to determine in four different hypertensive animal models the necessity of adding the calcium channel blocker amlodipine to therapy with the ss-blocker atenolol to modulate end-organ damage. Spontaneously hypertensive rats, DOCA-salt hypertensive rats, two-kidney, one-clip renovascular hypertensive rats and Lyon genetically hypertensive rats were used to study this objective. These animal models have different sensitivities to atenolol and amlodipine. The dosages of therapy employed were 10 mg/kg atenolol alone, 1 mg/kg amlodipine, 10 mg atenolol + 1 mg/kg amlodipine and 5 mg/kg atenolol+0.5 mg/kg amlodipine. BP was continuously recorded in all animals. After determination of baroreflex sensitivity, rats were sacrificed for end-organ damage evaluation. The combination of amlodipine and atenolol had a synergistic inhibitory effect on blood pressure and blood pressure variability, and end-organ damage as compared with monotherapy with atenolol or amlodipine in all animal models. Baroreflex sensitivity also improved with the combination therapy more than with monotherapy. In conclusion, atenolol and amlodipine combination exerts a superior effect on blood pressure, blood pressure variability, baroreflex sensitivity and end-organ damage.

All parameters were lower during day than night and higher in females than males. When compared with wild-type (WT) littermates, HR was higher in male A(1)R knockout (A(1)RKO) mice but lower in A(2A)RKO mice and intermediate in A(1)-A(2A)R double KO mice. A single dose of an unselective beta-blocker (timolol; 1 mg/kg) abolished the HR differences between these genotypes. Deletion of A(1)Rs had little effect on Temp, whereas deletion of A(2A)Rs increased it in females and decreased it in males. A(1)-A(2A)RKO mice had lower Temp than WT mice. LA was unaltered in A(1)RKO mice and lower in A(2A)RKO and A(1)-A(2A)RKO mice than in WT mice. Caffeine injection increased LA but only in mice expressing A(2A)R. Caffeine ingestion also increased LA in an A(2A)R-dependent manner in male mice. Caffeine ingestion significantly increased O(2)C in WT mice, but less in the different KO mice. Injection of 30 mg/kg caffeine decreased Temp, especially in KO mice, and hence in a manner unrelated to A(1)R or A(2A)R blockade. Selective A(2B) antagonism had little or no effect. Thus A(1)R and A(2A)R influence HR, Temp, LA, and O(2)C in mice in a sex-dependent manner, indicating effects of endogenous adenosine. The A(2A)R plays an important role in the modulation of O(2)C and LA by acute and chronic caffeine administration. There is also evidence for effects of higher doses of caffeine being independent of both A(1)R and A(2A)R.",

The samples were directly observed for the physical changes, and also analyzed by a validated HPLC method to determine the chemical changes. The study revealed that atenolol was incompatible with ascorbic acid, citric acid and butylated hydroxyanisole.

    "45": "The choice of primary and secondary endpoints for the individual studies of a research and development program is a classical biometric problem. Far-reaching decisions have to be made on the basis of incomplete information. Early studies in a program usually have functional or symptom-driven endpoints; the larger subsequent trials will usually focus on quality of life, morbidity or mortality. For program acceleration and cost reduction surrogate parameters are welcome. Unfortunately, there are only a few generally accepted surrogates for morbidity or mortality. At first glance, risk scores seem to be a suitable means for filling this gap. They are easily calculated, comprehensive and thus form a solid base for shared decision-making. However, further reasoning reveals that risk scores do not meet the usual standards for surrogates. What is more, a treatment targeting the reduction of a risk score cannot be considered an evidence-based intervention, which is due to a lack of randomized trials that compare risk score reduction to conventional interventions focussing on isolated risk factors. Thus, risk scores are unsuitable for primary endpoints, whereas they play an important role as comprehensive explanatory variables in study evaluation, i.e., for the description of population characteristics and as potential control variables or effect modifiers.", 
    "46": "In this work, the ion-transfer voltammetric detection of the protonated beta-blocker propranolol in artificial saliva is presented. Cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and differential pulse stripping voltammetry (DPSV) were employed in the detection of the cationic drug based on ion-transfer voltammetry across arrays of microinterfaces between artificial saliva and an organogel phase. It was found that the artificial saliva matrix decreased the available potential window for ion-transfer voltammetry at this liquid|liquid interface but transfer of protonated propranolol was still achieved. The DPSV method employed a preconditioning step as well as a preconcentration step followed by analytical signal generation based on the back-transfer of the drug across the array of microinterfaces. The DPSV peak current response was linear with drug concentration in the artificial saliva matrix over the concentration range of 0.05-1 microM (i(p) = -8.13 (nA microM(-1))(concentration) + 0.07 (nA), R = 0.9929, n = 7), and the calculated detection limit (3s(b)) was 0.02 microM.

If the 10-year risk is > or = 20% for CV events or > or = 5% for CV death, additional drug interventions are usually necessary: acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg daily, statins to lower LDL cholesterol to < 100 mg/dl or, in diabetics with coronary artery disease, to < 70 mg/dl, blood pressure should be < 130 mmHg systolic, e.g., in patients with diabetes or renal disease. After bare-metal stent implantation clopidogrel should be given for > or = 4 weeks and after drug-eluting stents for > or = 6 months. In patients after myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction of < 40%, ACE inhibitors and beta-blocker should be started. Influenza vaccination improves prognosis in high-risk patients.",

    "52": "cAMP/protein kinase (PK)A activation represents a key signaling mechanism for neurohormonal stimulation of diversified physiological processes. Using real-time, fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based imaging of PKA activity in neonatal cardiac myocytes, we report that sustained activation of PKA induced by beta-adrenoceptor (betaAR) dictates signaling propagation for substrate phosphorylation and myocyte contraction. Activation of betaARs in wild-type myocytes induces strong and sustained PKA activities, which are rapidly attenuated on washing away agonist or adding antagonist to the cells. The sustained PKA activities promote signaling propagation to the sarcoplasmic reticulum for phosphorylation of phospholamban and increases in myocyte contraction. Addition of antagonist after betaAR stimulation significantly attenuates PKA phosphorylation of phospholamban and rapidly reduces contraction rate increases. Moreover, stimulation of beta(1)AR subtype induces PKA activities similar to those in wild-type cells. In contrast, stimulation of beta(2)AR subtype induces strong initial activation of PKA similar to those induced by beta(1)AR; however, the activities are rapidly decreased to baseline levels. The transient PKA activities are sufficient for phosphorylation of the overexpressed beta(2)ARs under agonist stimulation, but not phospholamban. Further analysis reveals that phosphodiesterase 4 is the major family that shapes PKA activities under betaAR stimulation. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4 extends beta(2)AR-induced PKA activities, promotes PKA phosphorylation of phospholamban, and ultimately enhances myocyte contraction responses. Together, our data have revealed insights into kinetics of PKA activities in signaling propagation under neurohormonal stimulation.", 
    "53": "Topical glaucoma medications are widely used for childhood glaucoma, although little is known concerning the use of the newer glaucoma medications in this population. The majority of the references cited were extracted from PubMed. A literature review of all English language reports related to glaucoma medication in the pediatric population since 1980 was performed. Medical therapy of pediatric glaucoma contains four groups of drugs: beta-blockers (timolol and betaxolol), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide), alpha2-agonists (brimonidine), and prostaglandin analogs (latanoprost). Timolol is the first choice in pediatric glaucoma. In cases with insufficient reduction of the intraocular pressure (IOP), the combination of timolol once a day and dorzolamide twice a day brings about a good control of the IOP. Both medications are effective and well tolerated. The alpha2-agonists have more and potentially serious adverse effects in children and are contraindicated for children younger than 2 years of age. Latanoprost tends to be less effective in lowering IOP in children than in adults. However, no studies are reported where latanoprost is used in monotherapy. Additional study may further delineate this drug's role in treating pediatric glaucoma. The safety profile of latanoprost in children appears excellent.", 
    "54": "Acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) are characterized by a gradual or rapid progression of the signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF), resulting in a need for urgent therapy. Patients with AHFS comprise approximately 20% of all HF patients and represent the most severely ill and undermanaged subpopulation of patients with HF. Despite the rising prevalence and costs associated with AHFS, the disease remains largely undermanaged, partially as a result of a failure to initiate treatment with proven therapies, such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, during hospitalization or soon after discharge. Although professional organizations have been striving to improve the state of care for AHFS by providing at least some level of consensus and evidence-based treatment recommendations, the gap between the clinical evidence and actual practice is growing. Appropriate disease assessment, followed by the implementation of life-saving therapies, is the key to improving outcomes. Managed care initiatives, such as improved quality measures, disease management programs, patient education efforts, hospital discharge checklists, and pharmacy-led interventions to enhance medication compliance, provide potential solutions for combating the alarming rise of morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with this disease.", 
    "55": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Despite a variety of anti-inflammatory or immunomodulation drugs including interferon-beta are effective to reduce relapse risk, most patients have progressive neurological deterioration due to axonal degeneration. Accumulation of activated microglia is a pathological hallmark of active MS lesion. Microglia can act as not only antigen-presenting cells but also effector cells to damage other cells in the central nervous system. Especially, glutamate released by activated microglia induces excito-neurotoxicity and may contribute to neurodegeneration in MS. Gap junction is a major cell-to-cell channel and is composed of paired hemichannels on coupled cells. Recent studies showed that cells release various small molecules (including ions, ATP, and amino acids) from unpaired hemichannel of gap junction that is openly exposed to the extracellular space. We have previously revealed that activated microglia produce glutamate via glutaminase and release it through hemichannels of gap junctions. Thus, in this study, we examined whether the glutaminase inhibitor and the gap junction blocker relieved experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that is an animal model of MS. Here we show that the gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) and the glutaminase inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) decreased glutamate release from activated microglia and rescued neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In EAE mice, treatment with CBX or DON also attenuated EAE clinical symptoms. Thus, blockade of glutamate release from activated microglia with CBX or DON may be an effective therapeutic strategy against neurodegeneration in MS.", 
    "56": "In this study we investigated both intact and adrenalectomized rats to determine whether or not the anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen, nimesulide, tenoxicam and aspirin (IDINTA) are related to adrenal gland hormones in carrageenan-induced inflammation model of rats. Also, we investigated the anti-inflammatory action mechanism of hormones (adrenalin, cortisol) which perform a role in the anti-inflammatory effect of IDINTAon the adrenergic receptors. he results show that IDINTA produces significant anti-inflammatory effects in intact rats (ID(50): 9.82, 10.81, 95.21, 75.23, 8.21 and 61.84 mg/kg), but insignificant effects in adrenalectomized rats (ID(50): 152.97, 188.17, 1275.0, 433.67, 188.16 and 1028.17 mg/kg). In addition, adrenalin and prednisolone caused anti-inflammatory effect rates of 78.3% and 95.7% respectively in adrenalectomized rats. The anti-inflammatory effects of adrenalin and prednisolone did not change when prazosin (alpha(1)-receptor blocker), yohimbine (alpha(2)a2-receptor blocker) and phenoxybenzamine (alpha(2)- and alpha(2)-receptor blocker) were given to rat groups; however, in adrenalectomized rats administered with propranolol (a non-selective blocker of beta(1) and beta(2)-receptors) the anti-inflammatory effect of adrenalin was lost, and that of prednisolone decreased to 36.2%. It was also found that metoprolol (a selective blocker of beta(1)-receptors) did not alter the anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs. As a result, it was shown that anti-inflammatory effects of IDINTA are related to adrenalin and cortisol (corticosterone in rats). It was also determined for the first time that adrenalin (totally) and prednisolone (partially) triggered anti-inflammatory effects via the beta(2)-receptors but not via the alpha(1), alpha(2) and beta(1)-receptors.", 
    "57": "Beta(2)-adrenoreceptor overexpression is beneficial against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Whether beta-adrenoreceptors are involved in postconditioning (PostC) is unknown. We investigated whether nandrolone-decanoate (ND)-pretreatment can modulate (1) beta-adrenoreceptor expression and (2) post-ischemic cardiac function in response to I/R and PostC. Finally, we tested whether cardioprotection can be prevented by the inhibition of beta(2)-adrenoreceptors. Isolated rat hearts from ND pretreated (15 mg/kg/day i.m., for 14 days) and untreated-animals underwent 30-min ischemia and 120-min reperfusion. In subgroups, at the end of ischemia a PostC protocol (five cycles of 10-s reperfusion and 10-s ischemia) was applied and/or a beta(2)-adrenoreceptor blocker, ICI-118.551 (10 microM), was infused. Left ventricular pressure (LVP) was measured with an electromanometer, and infarct-size was evaluated using nitro-blue-tetrazolium staining. ND-pretreatment increased beta(2)-adrenoreceptor expression, but did not alter cardiac-weight, LVP and maximum rate of increase of LVP (dP/dt(max)). After I/R, infarct-size was smaller in ND-pretreatment than in untreated-animals. Infarct-size was also reduced by PostC, both in untreated and ND-pretreated animals. Contracture was less marked in ND-pretreated animals. PostC reduced contracture in both ND-pretreated and untreated hearts. Moreover, PostC improved post-ischemic recovery of developed LVP and dP/dt(max) much more in earts of ND-pretreated than untreated-animals. ICI-118.551 abolished ND protection and PostC-protection both in ND-pretreated and untreated hearts. Data show that two-weeks ND-pretreatment induces 1) an overexpression of beta(2)-ARs without cardiac hypertrophy and 2) improves the post-ischemic diastolic and systolic cardiac function. Intriguingly, ND-pretreatment potentiates the improvement of systolic function induced by postconditioning via beta(2)-adrenoreceptor activation.", 
    "58": "Adrenaline (0.001-1,000 muM) strongly stimulated adenosine-3',5'cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) generation in cultured human microvascular-derived endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Isoprenaline mimicked the action of adrenaline, whereas noradrenaline appeared to be decisively less potent. Experiments carried out with an array of compounds acting selectively on different types/subtypes of adrenergic receptors revealed that the adrenaline cAMP effect in HMEC-1 cells did not possess either an alpha(1) or alpha(2) component. However, the effect may have been mediated through a receptor that did not fit beta(1)-, beta(2)-, or beta(3)-receptor classification. Supporting this assertion, various double and triple beta-subtype selective drug combinations maximally inhibited the adrenaline effect by 50-60%, whereas the non-selective antagonist propranolol totally prevented the hormone-evoked cAMP effect. Based on results utilizing the phosphodiesterase (PDE)-isoform nonselective inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and the PDE-4-selective inhibitor rolipram, the adrenaline-driven cAMP signal appeared to be regulated by PDE-4. In addition, the present study demonstrated that phenylephrine, a presumed selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist, was capable of stimulating cAMP generation in HMEC-1 cells in a prazosin-insensitive and propranolol-sensitive manner. This result indicated that in at least this cell model system, phenylephrine may act nonspecifically. Microvessel-derived endothelial cells such as HMEC-1 exhibit functional differences when compared with macrovessel-derived endothelial cells (e.g. HUVEC sensitivity to adrenaline). Accordingly, these cell cultures represent a useful model system to study the biological effects of endogenous catecholamines, including adrenaline, as well as potential therapeutics targeting adrenergic receptors.", 
    "59": "As with other forms of psychological stress, conditioned fear causes an increase in body temperature. The mechanisms underlying this stress-induced hyperthermia are not well understood, but previous research suggests that nonshivering thermogenesis might contribute, as it does during cold exposure. The major source of nonshivering thermogenesis in the rat is brown adipose tissue (BAT), and the largest BAT deposit in that species is in the interscapular area just below the skin. BAT is also under sympathetic control via beta-adrenoceptors. If BAT contributes to fear-induced hyperthermia, then the interscapular skin should warm up faster than other skin areas, and this response should be suppressed by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. We tested this noninvasively by infrared thermography. In conscious rats, 30 min of contextual fear caused hyperthermia (as indicated by a +1.5 degrees C increase in lumbar back skin temperature) and increased the difference in temperature between interscapular and lumbar back skin (TiScap - TBack) by +1 degrees C. Propranolol (10 mg/kg ip) completely abolished this hyperthermia; however, the TiScap-TBack increase was not reduced. In contrast, exposure to cold air (4 degrees C) induced a +2.7 degrees C increase in TiScap-TBack, which was reduced to +1 degrees C after propranolol. The results show that conditioned fear-induced hyperthermia is of nonshivering origin and mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, but interscapular BAT does not contribute to it and does not appear to be activated, either.", 
    "60": "Angina pectoris is a cardiac condition characterized by an insufficient perfusion to meet myocardial metabolic demand. A high heart rate represents an important factor in the induction of myocardial ischemia and subsequent angina. beta-blocker drugs are effective at reducing angina pectoris by decreasing the heart rate and are usually preferred as initial therapy in the absence of contraindication or intolerance. Ivabradine, a new oral drug for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris, decreases the resting heart rate of patients with normal sinus rhythm. In many clinical trials, ivabradine has been directly compared with placebo, beta-blocker drugs (e.g., atenolol and propranolol) and calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine). These studies have demonstrated ivabradine, given in doses of 5-10 mg twice daily, to be more effective than placebo for increasing time to angina onset and noninferior to atenolol 50-100 mg daily and amlodipine 10 mg daily for increasing total exercise duration in patients with chronic stable angina. Visual symptoms, a transient, enhanced brightness in a limited area of the visual field known as luminous phenomena or phosphenes, were the most common adverse effects in clinical trials.

This may be associated with oxidative stress, which has been implicated in the desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs). The objective of this study was to investigate whether lung injury induced by intratracheal CEES exposure (2 mg/kg body weight) causes desensitization of beta-ARs. The animals were sacrificed after 7 days and lungs were removed. Lung injury was established by measuring the leakage of iodinated-bovine serum albumin ([(125)I]-BSA) into lung tissue. Receptor-binding characteristics were determined by measuring the binding of [(3)H] dihydroalprenolol ([(3)H] DHA) (0.5-24 nM) to membrane fraction in the presence and absence of DLDL-propranolol (10 micro M). Both high- and low-affinity beta-ARs were identified in the lung. Binding capacity was significantly higher in low-affinity site in both control and experimental groups. Although CEES exposure did not change K(D) and B(max) at the high-affinity site, it significantly decreased both K(D) and B(max) at low affinity sites. A 20% decrease in beta(2)-AR mRNA level and a 60% decrease in membrane protein levels were observed in the experimental group. Furthermore, there was significantly less stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by both cholera toxin and isoproterenol in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. Treatment of lungs with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE) could not abolish the difference between the control group and the experimental group on the stimulation of the adenylate cyclase activity.

    "92": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes substantial morbidity and mortality. It may be triggered and sustained by either reentrant or nonreentrant electrical activity. Human atrial cellular refractory period is shortened in chronic AF, likely aiding reentry. The ionic and molecular mechanisms are not fully understood and may include increased inward rectifier K(+) current and altered Ca(2+) handling. Heart failure, a major cause of AF, may involve arrhythmogenic atrial electrical remodeling, but the pattern is unclear in humans. Beta-blocker therapy prolongs atrial cell refractory period; a potentially antiarrhythmic influence, but the ionic and molecular mechanisms are unclear. The search for drugs to suppress AF without causing ventricular arrhythmias has been aided by basic studies of cellular mechanisms of AF. It remains to be seen whether such drugs will improve patient treatment.",

    "125": "Anatomical studies indicate that synaptic inputs from many cortical and subcortical structures converge on neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Although in vitro electrophysiological studies have examined synaptic inputs to dopamine (DA) and non-DA neurons in the VTA, they have largely relied upon local electrical stimulation to activate these synapses. This provides little information regarding the distinct properties of synapses originating from different brain areas. Using whole-cell recordings in parasagittal rat brain slices that preserved subcortical axons from the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) to the VTA, we compared these synapses with those activated by intra-VTA stimulation. PPN-evoked currents demonstrated longer latencies than intra-VTA-evoked currents, and both VTA and PPN responses were mediated by GABA(A) and AMPA receptors. However, unlike VTA-evoked currents, PPN currents were exclusively mediated by glutamate in 25-40% of the VTA neurons. Consistent with a cholinergic projection from the PPN to the VTA, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) were activated by endogenous acetylcholine released during PPN, but not VTA, stimulation. This was seen as a reduction of PPN-evoked, and not VTA-evoked, synaptic currents by the alpha7-nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and the agonist nicotine. The beta2-nAChR subunit antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine had no effect on VTA- or PPN-evoked synaptic currents. The effects of MLA on PPN-evoked currents were unchanged by the GABA(A) receptor blocker picrotoxin, indicating that alpha7-nAChRs presynaptically modulated glutamate and not GABA release. These differences in physiological and pharmacological properties demonstrate that ascending PPN and presumed descending inputs to VTA utilize distinct mechanisms to differentially modulate neuronal activity and encode cortical and subcortical information.",

    "133": "Several lines of data previously indicated that N-terminally truncated forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides are likely the earliest and more abundant species immunohistochemically detectable in Alzheimer's disease-affected brains. It is noteworthy that the free N-terminal residue of full-length Abeta (fl-Abeta) is an aspartyl residue, suggesting that Abeta could be susceptible to exopeptidasic attack by aminopeptidase A (APA)-like proteases. In this context, we have examined whether APA could target Abeta peptides in both cell-free and cellular models. We first show that the general aminopeptidase inhibitor amastatin as well as two distinct aminopeptidase A inhibitors EC33 and pl302 both significantly increase the recovery of genuine fl-Abeta peptides generated by cells over-expressing Swedish-mutated beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) while the aminopeptidase N blocker pl250 did not modify fl-Abeta recovery. In agreement with this observation, we establish that over-expressed APA drastically reduces, in a calcium dependent manner, fl-Abeta but not APP IntraCellular Domain in a cell-free model of Abeta production. In agreement with the above data, we show that recombinant APA degrades fl-Abeta in a pl302-sensitive manner. Interestingly, we also show that EC33 and pl302 lower staurosporine-stimulated activation of caspase-3 in wild-type fibroblasts but not in betaAPP/beta-amyloid precursor protein-like protein 2 (APLP2) double knockout fibroblasts, suggesting that protecting endogenous fl-Abeta physiological production triggers neuroprotective phenotype. By contrast, EC33 does not modify staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation in wild-type and Swedish-mutated betaAPP-HEK293 expressing cells that display exacerbated production of Abeta. Overall, our data establish that APA contributes to the N-terminal truncation of Abeta and suggest that this cleavage is likely abrogating a protective function associated with physiological but not supraphysiological levels of genuine fl-Abeta peptides.",

The study population consisted of 57 patients who completed a carvedilol placebo-controlled phase II trial. Patients were given open-label carvedilol and were titrated to the maximum dose. Patients were assessed by serial multigated acquisition, echocardiography, and symptom scores. Survival was assessed for all patients and censored as of January 1, 2004. Survival for ischemic vs nonischemic patients was compared using the log-rank test and further compared using Cox regression, controlling for covariates. Etiology of heart failure was ischemic in 15 patients and nonischemic in 42 patients. Median follow-up was 12.9 years. Resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and heart failure symptom scores improved at 4 months of treatment and were sustained at 24 months. Left ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVIDS) and left ventricular internal diameter in diastole decreased significantly at 4 and 8 months, respectively, and LVIDS continued to improve at 24 months. Overall mortality was 43% in nonischemic patients and 73% in ischemic patients. In a multivariate analysis, ischemic etiology and baseline LVEF were significant predictors of mortality. Carvedilol produces sustained improvements in left ventricular remodeling and symptoms. Long-term survival is good, particularly in nonischemic patients.", 
    "135": "This study examined an interaction between glutamate and norepinephrine in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in modulating affective memory formation. Male Wistar rats with indwelling cannulae in the BNST were trained on a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task and received pre- or post-training intra-BNST infusion of glutamate, norepinephrine or their antagonists. Results of the 1-day test indicated that post-training intra-BNST infusion of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) impaired retention in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while infusion of glutamate had an opposite effect. Co-infusion of 0.2microg glutamate and 0.02microg norepinephrine resulted in marked retention enhancement by summating non-apparent effects of the two drugs given at a sub-enhancing dose. The amnesic effect of 5.0microg APV was ameliorated by 0.02microg norepinephrine, while the memory enhancing effect of 1.0microg glutamate was attenuated by 5.0microg propranolol. These findings suggest that training on an inhibitory avoidance task may alter glutamate neurotransmission, which by activating NMDA receptors releases norepinephrine to modulate memory formation via beta adrenoceptors in the BNST.",

This level was confirmed in a Cox regression model controlling for age, gender, ejection fraction, New York Heart Association, comorbidity, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, and beta-blocker use. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that adherence rates above 88% produced the optimal combination of sensitivity and specificity with respect to predicting better event-free survival. With 88% as the adherence cutpoint, the hazard ratio for time to first event for the nonadherent group was 2.2 by dose count (P = .021) and 3.2 by dose day (P = .002).",

    "145": "Recent studies have called into question the benefit of perioperative beta blockade, especially in patients at low to moderate risk of cardiac events. Once considered standard of care, the role of beta-blocker therapy now lies mired in conflicting data that are difficult to apply to the at-risk patient. We provide an overview of the evolution of perioperative beta blockade, beginning with the physiology of the adrenergic system, with emphasis on the biologic rationale for the perioperative implementation of beta-blockers. Although initial studies were small in size and statistically limited, early data showed cardiac benefit with the use of perioperative beta-blockers. However, larger, more recent studies now suggest a lack of benefit and potential harm from this practice. This paradigm holds true especially in those at low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profiles. Potential explanations for these paradoxical results are discussed, stressing the key differences between earlier and current studies that may explain these divergent outcomes. We conclude by commenting on performance measures as they relate to perioperative beta-blockers and make recommendations for the continued safe implementation of this practice.",

    "147": "Fifty-eight patients with anterior or intermediate uveitis and elevated IOP or glaucoma presented or followed up in the Ocular Inflammation and Immunology Service of General Hospital of Athens were randomly assigned to receive treatment either with latanoprost (30) or with dorzolamide/timolol (28). The main outcome measures were inflammatory relapses and IOP response to treatment.", 
    "148": "Ten patients (34%) in the latanoprost group and sixteen patients (57%) in the dorzolamide/timolol group experienced relapses of anterior uveitis (p = 0.93). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in respect of inflammatory relapses (p = 0.21). Twenty-one patients were followed up before starting latanoprost. The number of recurrences of anterior uveitis per patient per year before treatment with latanoprost was 0.82 +/- 1.2. The rate of relapses per patient per year after starting latanoprost was 0.39 +/-0.7 for these patients (p = 0.038). After 1 year of treatment, intraocular pressure was dropped from 27.8 +/- 8.4 mmHg to 18.6 +/- 5.3 mmHg (p < 0.001) in the latanoprost group and from 28.2 +/-8.1 mmHg to 22.6 +/-10.1 mmHg (p < 0.001) in the dorzolamide/timolol group.

On day 8, the rats were anaesthetized and renal vasoconstrictor experiments performed. One group of rats underwent acute unilateral renal denervation.", 
    "152": "There were significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the renal vasoconstrictor responses to noradrenaline, phenylephrine, methoxamine and Ang II after losartan and carvedilol treatments compared with that in untreated rats (all P < 0.05). However, in renally denervated SHR treated with carvedilol, the vasoconstrictor responses to all the vasoactive agents were enhanced compared with those in SHR with intact renal nerves treated with carvedilol. Intact SHR given both losartan and carvedilol showed greater renal vasoconstrictor responses to the vasoactive agents than when given either losartan or carvedilol alone (all P < 0.05).", 
    "153": "Carvedilol reduced the vasoconstrictor response to Ang II and all the adrenergic agonists in the presence of the renal nerves, but, following the removal of renal sympathetic activity, carvedilol enhanced the sensitivity of both renal alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and AT(1) receptors to the vasoactive agents. Co-treatment with losartan and carvedilol reduced the renal vasoconstrictor responses to exogenously administered vasoactive agents but to a lesser extent than losartan or carvedilol alone. The results obtained demonstrate an interaction between Ang II receptors and adrenergic neurotransmission in the SHR.", 
    "154": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a higher incidence of mortality, stroke, and coronary events than is sinus rhythm. AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be administered to slow immediately a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nondrug therapies should be performed in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. Paroxysmal AF associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be treated with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in patients with AF and symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with ventricular pauses greater than 3 seconds which are not drug-induced. Elective DC cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than does medical cardioversion in converting AF to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography has shown no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective DC or drug cardioversion of AF and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer, especially in older patients, ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than maintaining sinus rhythm with antiar-rhythmic drugs. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Patients with AF at low risk for stroke or with contraindications to warfarin should be treated with aspirin 325 mg daily.", 
    "155": "Effects of goshuyuto, a traditional Japanese medicine, on vascular constriction were examined using isolated strips of rat aorta. Goshuyuto (1 x 10(-5) to 1 x 10(-3) g/ml) caused constriction of aorta strips in a dose-dependent manner. The vasoconstrictive effects of goshuyuto were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with prazosin, an adrenergic alpha(1) receptor antagonist. The constrictive effects were partially inhibited by pretreatment with BRL15572, a 5-HT(1D) antagonist, and ketanserin, a 5-HT(2A) antagonist. However, the constrictive effects were not inhibited by pretreatment with SB216641, a 5-HT(1B) antagonist, or propranolol, an adrenergic beta receptor antagonist. In addition, aqueous extracts of Evodiae Fructus, one of the constituent medicinal herbs of goshuyuto, caused constriction of aorta strips strongly, but aqueous extracts of Zizyphi Fructus, Ginseng Radix, and Zingiberis Rhizoma, the other constituents of goshuyuto, did not have much effect on the vascular response of rat aorta strips. Also, synephrine, which is one of the ingredients of Evodiae Fructus, constricted the rat aorta. These results suggest that goshuyuto constricts rat aorta strips and that the mechanisms involve the adrenergic and/or serotonergic receptors. Also, it may be suggested that Evodiae Fructus and synephrine play the important role in the vasoconstrictive effects of goshuyuto on rat aorta strips.",

This study investigates the hypothesis that beta(3)-adrenergic signaling undergoes alterations in failing myocardium.", 
    "162": "We compared eNOS- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression using Western blot analysis in human nonfailing myocardium versus failing myocardium. With the use of immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of the beta(3)-adrenoceptor protein and eNOS translocation and phosphorylation under basal conditions. beta(3)-adrenergic, eNOS activation, and inotropy were measured in failing myocardium using BRL37344 (BRL, a beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist).", 
    "163": "beta(3)-adrenoceptor expression was increased in failing myocardium. Under basal conditions, Akt- and eNOS(Ser1177) phosphorylation were reduced in failing myocardium. During stimulation with BRL in failing myocardium, a further dephosphorylation of eNOS(Ser1177) and Akt was observed, whereas eNOS(Ser114) phosphorylation was increased. These results suggest a deactivation of eNOS via beta(3)-adrenergic stimulation. Nevertheless, BRL decreased contractility in failing myocardium, but this effect was not observed in the presence of the NO blocker L-NMA. In failing myocardium, the beta(3)-adrenoceptor was predominantly expressed in endothelial cells. In the cardiomyocytes, the beta(3)-adrenoceptor was mainly located at the intercalated disks.", 
    "164": "In failing cardiomyocytes, beta(3)-adrenergic stimulation seems to deactivate rather than activate eNOS. At the same time, beta(3)-adrenergic stimulation induced a NO-dependent negative inotropic effect. Because beta(3)-adrenoceptors are expressed mainly in the endothelium in failing myocardium, our observations suggest a paracrine-negative inotropic effect via NO liberation from the cardiac endothelial cells.", 
    "165": "We tested if remote gene delivery of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) protected hearts against induced ischemia, hypothesizing that gene delivery into skeletal muscle may lead to secretion of proteins with actions elsewhere. Murine quadriceps muscles were transfected with DNA encoding for human HIF-1 alpha, which resulted in a local, but lasting expression (mRNA and protein, where the latter had nuclear localization). Subjection of isolated hearts to global ischemia and reperfusion 1, 4, and 8 weeks after gene delivery resulted in infarct size reduction (p < 0.05). Supporting that this was due to paracrine effects, HL-1 cells treated with conditioned media from cells transfected with HIF-1 alpha or serum from HIF-1 alpha-treated mice were protected against H(2)O(2)-induced cell death (p < 0.05, respectively). The latter protection was reduced when a heme oxygenase activity blocker was used. Taqman low-density array of 47 HIF-1 alpha-regulated genes at the treatment site showed nine specific upregulations (p < 0.05). Of the corresponding proteins, PDGF-B and adrenomedullin were upregulated in the heart. HIF-1 alpha treatment induced an increased vascularization of the heart and skeletal muscle. In conclusion, remote delivery of DNA for HIF-1 alpha was cardioprotective, represented by consistent infarct size reduction, which may be due to release of paracrine factors from the transfected muscle.", 
    "166": "In-vitro studies have shown that WAY 100635 is not only a potent 5-HT1A antagonist, but also has high affinity and efficacy at the dopamine D(4) receptor. Nevertheless, the behavioral effects of this compound have not been investigated. This study sought to characterize the discriminative stimulus effects produced by WAY 100635. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a two-lever, fixed ratio 50, food-reinforced task with WAY 100635 (10 micromol/kg) as a discriminative stimulus. Substitution tests with different doses of WAY 100635 and (-)-pindolol, and combination tests with two 5-HT1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT and LY 293284; and two dopamine D(4) antagonists, sonepiprazole and A-381393, were performed. Rats trained with a low dose (0.74 micromol/kg) of WAY 100635 could not learn the discrimination task after more than 3 months of sessions. Rats trained to discriminate 10 micromol/kg of WAY 100635 from saline achieved the criterion of accuracy after approximately 35 training sessions. WAY 100635 (2.5-10 micromol/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in WAY 100635-appropriate responding, with a mean effective dose of 3.44 micromol/kg, whereas saline or pindolol (5-25 micromol/kg) administration resulted in 0% drug lever responding. Pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) agonists 8-OH-DPAT or LY 293284 did not modify the WAY 100635 curve, but pretreatment with the selective dopamine D(4) antagonists sonepiprazole or A-381393 completely blocked the cue. These results indicate that the discriminative stimulus effect produced by WAY 100635 is mediated by activation of dopamine D(4) receptors.", 
    "167": "Beta-blockers (beta-blockers) have demonstrated their value across the cardiovascular disease spectrum. Beta-blockers effectively lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension and provide symptomatic or mortality benefits in patients with heart failure and in post-myocardial infarction patients. However, despite their utility, beta-blockers remain underused. There have been recent concerns that beta-blockers as a class are not as effective as once thought in uncomplicated hypertension due to a relatively weak effect on reduction of stroke and the absence of an effect on coronary heart disease when compared with placebo or no treatment. Underuse can, in part, be related to tolerability concerns. Beta-blockers have been traditionally associated with side effects including depression, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and cold extremities, which limit their acceptance by patients and physicians and may lead to discontinuation of therapy. Because of inherent heterogeneity of the beta-blocker class in terms of adrenergic receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and vasodilatory activity, these agents vary in tolerability profile. Recently, more attention has been focused on the third-generation vasodilatory beta-blockers (ie, carvedilol, labetalol, and nebivolol), with the recognition that these agents may diverge in meaningful ways from the traditional beta-blockers. By examining the differences among members of the beta-blocker class, it may be possible to determine whether and which tolerability issues are indeed a class effect of beta-blockers or whether these agents should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.",

Factors related to smaller BP decline were low baseline BP, high baseline PWV, need for a double dose of treatment, use of atenolol (only for SBP response), and age (only for DBP). Although DBP control did not differ in the PWV tertiles, SBP control was significantly associated with PWV level (p = 0.001) as well as with the use of perindopril/indapamide (p < 0.001). The predictive value of PWV on BP response was independent of age, sex, mean BP, and cardiovascular risk factors.",

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells express functional sodium channel complexes, consisting of Na(V)1.5 and associated auxiliary beta-subunits, that are responsible for a sustained inward sodium current at the membrane potential. Although these channels do not regulate cellular multiplication or migration, their inhibition by the specific blocker tetrodotoxin impairs both the extracellular gelatinolytic activity (monitored with DQ-gelatin) and cell invasiveness leading to the attenuation of colony growth and cell spreading in three-dimensional Matrigel-composed matrices. MDA-MB-231 cells express functional cysteine cathepsins, which we found play a predominant role ( approximately 65%) in cancer invasiveness. Matrigel invasion is significantly decreased in the presence of specific inhibitors of cathepsins B and S (CA-074 and Z-FL-COCHO, respectively), and co-application of tetrodotoxin does not further reduce cell invasion. This suggests that cathepsins B and S are involved in invasiveness and that their proteolytic activity partly depends on Na(V) function. Inhibiting Na(V) has no consequence for cathepsins at the transcription, translation, and secretion levels. However, Na(V) activity leads to an intracellular alkalinization and a perimembrane acidification favorable for the extracellular activity of these acidic proteases. We propose that Na(v) enhance the invasiveness of cancer cells by favoring the pH-dependent activity of cysteine cathepsins. This general mechanism could lead to the identification of new targets allowing the therapeutic prevention of metastases."
