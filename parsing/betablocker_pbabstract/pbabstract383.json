Sixteen patients had suffered a previous myocardial infarction (Group 1), 22 had various non-ischaemic cardiac diseases (Group 2) and nine had no heart disease (Group 3). All patients underwent two 24 h Holter recordings during the washout period, and a third Holter recording was taken 5 days after the administration of nadolol (80 mg.day-1). The RR cycle length (RR), SDRR and CV were evaluated for each 24 h period, as well as for six daytime (1000-1600h) and six night-time hours (0000-0600h). In all three groups, nadolol was highly effective in lengthening RR. However, the effect on SDRR was different in the three groups; 24-h SDRR tended to be reduced in all three groups (but the reduction was significant only in Group 1) due to a certain RR homogeneity. On the other hand, daytime SDRR tended to increase (but the increase was significant only in Group 3). CV is concomitantly affected by heart rate and SDRR, therefore it may be more sensitive in evaluating the effect of beta-blockers. The reduction in CV post-nadolol means that the bradycardia-induced effect is associated with an inadequate increase, or even a reduction in SDRR, whereas the absence of any CV changes (found only in Group 3) is the result of a concomitant increase in both RR cycle length and SDRR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Rapid ventricular pacing (VP) reproduces neurohumoral variations associated with ventricular tachycardia. This study was set up to analyse the mechanisms that cause changes in sinus heart rate after rapid VP and to find the clinical factors that adapt sinus heart rate to VP, and the clinical value of the method. Rapid VP was performed in 356 patients aged 15 to 86 years, in increments of 10 beats, at progressively faster rates every 10 s up to 200 beats.min-1. Group I comprised 122 patients with no underlying heart disease; group II comprised 234 patients with an underlying heart disease. The sinus heart rate (HR) was initially accelerated (SR1), in comparison with the basal sinus HR, for 2 to 5 s (90.5 beats.min +/- 21 vs 71 +/- 19 in group I, 89.5 +/- 26 vs 76 +/- 16 in group II). Five seconds later, there was a decrease in HR (SR2) which was slower than the basal HR (62 beats.min +/- 22 in group I, 75 +/- 15 in group II). The variations in HR, defined as SR1-SR2/SR1, were significantly higher in group I than group II: 31 +/- 18% vs 19 +/- 15%, (P < 0.001). With the injection of 2 mg atropine in 14 group I patients the variations in HR were suppressed after ventricular pacing. When oral beta-blockers were administered to 21 group I patients, there were still significant changes in HR. The changes in HR were reproducible during electrophysiological study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The protein binding of the enantiomers of propranolol and verapamil was measured in 19 pairs of maternal and foetal serum obtained at delivery. The binding of the enantiomers of both drugs was lower in foetal than in maternal serum. In maternal serum the mean (+/- s.d.) unbound percentages were 22.4 +/- 6.2 and 20.7 +/- 6.6 for R- and S-propranolol, and 16.8 +/- 5.5 and 22.5 +/- 6.2 for R- and S-verapamil; in foetal serum the values were 38.8 +/- 8.6 and 40.4 +/- 10.6 for R- and S-propranolol, and 34.7 +/- 10.5 and 44.8 +/- 10.7 for R- and S-verapamil. For propranolol, in maternal, but not in foetal serum, the difference between the binding of the R- and S-enantiomers was significant; the R/S ratio was significantly (P < 0.01) larger in the mother (1.099 +/- 0.072) than in the foetus (0.973 +/- 0.068). For verapamil, the difference in binding between the R- and S-enantiomers was significant in both maternal and foetal serum, but the R/S ratio was similar in mother (0.735 +/- 0.098) and foetus (0.763 +/- 0.070). Serum alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) concentrations were markedly higher and albumin concentrations slightly lower in maternal than in foetal samples. The binding of the four enantiomers in maternal and foetal serum was correlated (P < 0.001) with the AAG concentration (r propranolol: R 0.749, S 0.746; r verapamil: R 0.753, S 0.782). Our findings show that measurement of concentrations of total, unresolved drug allow a reasonably accurate assessment of transplacental gradients of individual isomers.", 
    "3": "The authors report two cases of severe myocardial ischaemia with healthy coronary arteries associated with mitral valvular prolapse (MVP). The first case was a 43-year-old woman treated with beta-blockers following the discovery of MVP. This patient was admitted to hospital six months later with persistent chest pain in a context of cardiogenic shock. The response to treatment was rapid and spectacular. The second case was a 44-year-old hypertensive smoker man in whom assessment of chest pain revealed several signs of myocardial infarction as well as MVP. This rare combination of MVP and myocardial ischaemia raises pathophysiological as well as therapeutic problems.", 
    "4": "Blockade of GABAA function in the region of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) of rats is known to elicit a constellation of physiologic responses including increases in heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate, and plasma catecholamine levels, as well as behavioral responses such as increases in locomotor activity and anxiogenic-like effects as measured in a conflict test and the elevated plus-maze test. The aim of the present study was to test the effects of microinjecting GABAA antagonists bicuculline methiodide (BMI) and picrotoxin, as well as the GABAA agonist muscimol, into the DMH of rats placed in the social interaction (SI) test. Muscimol decreased HR and BP but increased SI, whereas the GABA antagonists increased HR and BP but decreased SI time. Blocking the HR changes elicited by GABAergic drugs injected into the DMH with systemic injections of atenolol and atropine methylbromide did not block their effects on SI.", 
    "5": "Effects of chronic treatment with propranolol or atenolol on stress-induced changes in blood pressure, body weight, and cerebral beta-adrenoceptors in rats were examined and compared with the effects of chronic treatment with prazosin. Immobilization stress (2 h daily for 2 weeks) induced a moderate elevation of blood pressure, loss of body weight gain, and downregulation of cerebral beta-adrenoceptors, but produced no changes in the cerebral alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Chronic administration of propranolol (5 or 50 mg.kg-1), atenolol (5 or 50 mg.kg-1) or prazosin (2 or 20 mg.kg-1) inhibited stress-induced hypertension but did not affect loss of body weight gain. Propranolol increased the density of cerebral beta-adrenoceptors by 77% and reduced the downregulation induced by stress. Atenolol also increased the density of cerebral beta-adrenoceptors by 34% and abolished the stress-induced downregulation in cerebral beta-adrenoceptor density. In contrast, prazosin had no effect on the cerebral beta-adrenoceptors in nonstressed or stressed rats. These results suggest that the antihypertensive action of propranolol and atenolol may be partly associated with the inhibition of stress-activated central beta-adrenoceptor transmission.", 
    "6": "The absolute bioavailability of metoprolol (MP) was evaluated following oral and transdermal administration in hairless rats. The absolute bioavailability of MP following oral administration was 3.48 +/- 1.73%, indicating that MP is subject to extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism. Transdermal delivery of MP, via an adhesive delivery device, resulted in a bioavailability of 30.07 +/- 4.84%, indicating that the transdermal delivery of MP can significantly increase systemic bioavailability compared with oral administration. Preliminary skin irritation studies indicated that neither MP nor the adhesive used in the device caused any appreciable skin irritation in the hairless rats.", 
    "7": "Epithelial cells of the intestine enclose isozymes able to metabolize propranolol, raising the possibility that the gut contributes with the liver to the first-pass uptake and systemic clearance of propranolol. To assess the role of the liver in the first-pass uptake, propranolol was injected into the jugular vein and a mesenteric vein of anesthetized New Zealand rabbits, and blood samples were drawn from the abdominal aorta, or it was injected into the intestine and samples were drawn simultaneously from the portal vein and the abdominal aorta. Extraction of propranolol by the liver was estimated to be 96-97%. To assess the intestinal extraction of oral propranolol, a porto-cava transposition was conducted in two groups of animals, and propranolol was injected into the first 30 cm of the small intestine or into the jugular vein and samples were withdrawn from the abdominal aorta; propranolol extraction by the intestine was 43%. To document the contribution of the intestine in the systemic clearance of propranolol, propranolol was injected into the jugular vein and blood samples were drawn simultaneously from the abdominal aorta (before the gut) and from the portal vein (after the gut); propranolol extraction from the systemic circulation by the intestine was 24%. Only the liver generated detectable amounts of conjugated metabolites of propranolol. In the in vitro studies, it was shown that propranolol was rapidly metabolized by the liver, yielding 4-hydroxypropranolol and conjugates of propranolol; propranolol metabolism in the proximal small intestine was slower and yielded only 4-hydroxypropranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Clearance of the beta-blocker, propranolol (PR), is decreased in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, in both humans and rats. However, inflammation in arthritic patients is often controlled by drugs such as the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Therefore, it is possible that arthritic-induced changes in drug disposition are minimized or suppressed in subjects receiving NSAIDs. To examine this hypothesis, we induced mild and severe adjuvant arthritis (AA) in rats and daily doses of the NSAID, ketoprofen (KT), were given to half of these rats. The pharmacokinetics of PR were thus examined in nontreated (MILDcontrol and SEVEREcontrol) and KT-treated (MILDKT and SEVEREKT) arthritic rats. Treatment with KT significantly reduced the arthritic index (AI) in the severe model of AA. In AA, the AUC0-8 of R- and S-PR were not significantly different in MILDKT rats (R, 15.8 +/- 9.5; S, 1.72 +/- 9.1 mg.hr/liter) as compared with MILDcontrol rats (R, 16.2 +/- 12; S, 1.76 +/- 1.2 mg.hr/liter). On the other hand, the AUC0-8 of both enantiomers were significantly lower in SEVEREKT (R, 39.2 +/- 13.2; S, 2.92 +/- 1.2 mg.hr/liter) as compared with SEVEREcontrol (R, 79.9 +/- 17; S, 6.88 +/- 2.1 mg.hr/liter). A high correlation between disease severity (AI) and the AUC0-8 of R- (r = 0.82) and S-PR (r = 0.81) was observed in all groups. Furthermore, the relationship between the AI and protein binding of R- and S-PR was significant in severe AA. Therefore, increased plasma concentrations of PR in arthritis are related to the degree of inflammation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "We have used an isolated perfused fetal sheep liver preparation to study the fetal hepatic metabolism of propranolol in vitro in the intact organ. Eight livers were perfused in situ via the umbilical vein in an oxygenated recirculating system at 300 ml/min. Radiolabeled 15-microns microspheres were used to quantify the hepatic ductus venosus shunt. Propranolol (4 mg) was dosed into the reservoir as a single bolus and perfusate and bile sampled over 150 min. Propranolol, 4-hydroxy propranolol (4OHP), 5-hydroxy propranolol (5OHP), desisopropylpropranolol (DIP), naphthoxylactic acid (NLA), and alpha-naphthoxyacetic acid (NAA) were assayed by HPLC, before and after deconjugation by enzyme hydrolysis. Mean age was 125 +/- 10 days, and mean liver weight was 66.1 +/- 18.8 g. Oxygen consumption (1.10 +/- 1.03 mumol/g/min), bile flow (0.51 +/- 0.18 microliters/g/min), and perfusion pressure (8.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg) were stable. Ductus venosus shunt was 41.6 +/- 17.4% of umbilical vein flow. Propranolol clearance was 26.2 +/- 13.4 ml/min, and shunt-corrected extraction of propranolol was 0.26 +/- 0.13. The relative amounts of metabolites in perfusate after 150 min were: 4OHP (25.1%), 5OHP (5.08%) (ring-oxidation products), DIP (6.57%), and NLA (4.33%) (side-chain oxidation products). No alpha NAA (a product of N-dealkylation of NLA) was detected. Except for NLA, metabolites were present predominantly as conjugates. Biliary excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites accounted for a further 1.33% of the propranolol dose. These data indicate that, although the hepatic clearance and extraction of propranolol are low, the fetal sheep liver can metabolize propranolol by both ring- and side-chain oxidation reactions and can conjugate these metabolites.", 
    "10": "1. Inotropic responses to alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and the effects of antagonists were examined in isolated ventricular preparations from neonatal and adult mice. 2. Phenylephrine, in the presence of propranolol, produced positive inotropic responses in neonates up to 1 week after birth, while it produced negative inotropic responses in mice older than 3 weeks. 3. Both positive and negative responses to phenylephrine in neonates and adults, respectively, were antagonized by prazosin, WB4101 (2-([2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl]aminomethyl)-1,4-benzodioxane) and 5-methylurapidil, but not by atropine, yohimbine or chlorethylclonidine. 4. Noradrenaline (NA) produced positive inotropic responses both in the neonate and adult; the responses were observed in a lower concentration-range in the neonate than in the adult. WB4101 produced a significant leftward shift of the concentration-response curve for noradrenaline in adult preparations while only a slight rightward shift was observed in the neonate. 5. Our results demonstrate the presence of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic responses in the mouse ventricular myocardia. The response to phenylephrine changes from a positive to a negative effect during postnatal development. The responses are mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, and modulate the overall inotropic response to NA in the adult.", 
    "11": "The aim of this work was to assess the participation of the sympathetic nervous system in the thermogenic response to food in control and hyperphagic rats. Rats were fed either a control (CD) or energy dense (ED) diet. After 15 days, CD rats received a small (7 kJ) meal composed of either control or energy dense diet, while ED rats received a small meal composed of energy dense diet. The experiment was then repeated, with the exception that rats received a larger portion (35 kJ) of the test meal. The postprandial increase in oxygen consumption was measured for 30 min after the small meal and 90-180 min after the completion of the large meal. The measurements were made in saline-injected and propranolol-injected rats. ED rats exhibited hyperphagia as well as an increase of 32% in resting metabolic rate after a 16 h fast. The sympathetically-mediated postprandial increase in oxygen consumption was greater after an energy dense meal than after a control meal in CD rats, and was higher in ED rats than in CD rats fed an energy dense meal. It was concluded that the sympathetically-mediated increase in the thermogenic response to food, as well as the increase in fasting metabolic rate can help prevent obesity development in hyperphagic rats.", 
    "12": "Daily life cardiac ischaemia is defined as reversible myocardial cellular hypoxia that occurs during activities of daily living, without artificial provocation. Most of these daily life ischaemic episodes are not associated with symptoms. However, it is not practical to distinguish silent versus symptomatic daily life ischaemia as both are associated with haemodynamic abnormalities and future adverse outcomes. Daily life cardiac ischaemia is best detected using ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring; however, there are other diagnostic tools (e.g. exercise treadmill) that can be used. Once detected, the optimal therapy for daily life myocardial ischaemia has yet to be identified. However, it does appear that usual antianginal medications including nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and antiplatelet drugs are effective in reducing the incidence and severity of daily life myocardial ischaemia. Medical therapy and revascularisation should be utilised to obliterate all episodes of daily life cardiac ischaemia to prevent future cardiac events. Moreover, the efficacy of the chosen therapeutic regimen for each patient should be documented with follow-up objective testing. The diagnosis and management of daily life myocardial ischaemia is continually evolving. Future research as well as economic considerations will shape future management strategies.", 
    "13": "Antihypertensive therapy has been used for almost 40 years to reduce blood pressure and to prevent morbidity and mortality related to the hypertensive state. Cardiovascular events are related to the initial elevation of blood pressure; the benefits of treating malignant, severe or moderate hypertension are well established. Although large scale clinical trials have demonstrated a decrease in morbid events when mildly elevated blood pressures is treated, the benefits are neither universal or dramatic and treatment is certainly less cost effective than no treatment. Recently it has been emphasised that the absolute risk of cardiovascular events is determined only in part by blood pressure, and that it is also influenced by age, gender, race and the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors. For example, in older individuals where the absolute risk of vascular complications is greater than in younger individuals for any given level of blood pressure, the benefits of therapy will be greater. It has been suggested that in younger individuals with mild hypertension and a low absolute risk of developing cardiovascular morbid events it may be more appropriate to monitor the effects of drug therapy on measures of cardiac and vascular damage that are associated with the hypertensive state. Drug therapy has been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the incidence of stroke, congestive cardiac failure and renal failure associated with elevated blood pressure. Meta-analysis of randomised large scale clinical trials indicates that drug therapy may not reduce coronary events to the extent expected in patients with hypertension. One plausible explanation is that the trials have been of insufficient duration to detect the benefit of blood pressure lowering on coronary heart disease. It has also been suggested that certain adverse metabolic effects associated with the use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers employed in these trials may have partially offset the benefits of blood pressure reduction. However, the clinical significance of these drug-induced metabolic disturbances remains unclear. Experimental data suggesting differences in the ability of antihypertensive drugs to inhibit atherosclerosis in animal models are also of interest, but again the relation of the findings to the clinical situation is unknown. Thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and alpha-blockers can produce regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). While LVH is clearly a strong and independent predictor for coronary disease, it remains to be shown that a lower risk for coronary morbid events exists in patients whose LVH has undergone regression over and above that attributable to blood pressure reduction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "14": "A series of phenoxypropanolamines having a hydrazinopyridazinyl moiety was synthesized. Their hypotensive and beta-blocking activities were evaluated after intravenous administration of the compounds to anesthetized rats. Some of them exhibited both activities. In particular, compound 20k is a candidate for clinical use due to its hypotensive activity, equal to that of hydralazine, and its beta-blocking activity, 2.7-fold more potent than that of propranolol.", 
    "15": "The diagnostic work-up and the appropriate therapy of patients with recurrent syncopy represents an often encountered clinical problem. The underlying etiology of a syncopal episode remains not infrequently unknown despite intensive and sometimes costly diagnostic procedures. Particularly in young patients with syncopal attacks, the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope has been established on the basis of normal findings during conventional cardiologic and neurologic work-up. Only since the introduction of the tilt-table test into clinical practice has the clinician had a diagnostic tool to prove the neurocardiogenic etiology of a syncopal episode. It has been demonstrated that this diagnostic method yields a good reproducibility which makes it suitable to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. There have been several therapeutic recommendations according to the multifactorial pathogenesis of neurocardiogenic syncope. Among these, therapy with beta-receptor blocking agents or with theophylline appears to be the most promising treatment modalities. The results obtained in the studies reviewed in the present article have increased our knowledge with respect to the pathogenesis of neurocardiogenic syncope as well as the diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities in patients afflicted with this disorder.", 
    "16": "The effects of the calcium channel blockers diltiazem on the parasympathetic nervous system were studied by using spectral analysis of heart rate variability, and were compared with the effects of the beta-receptor blocker metoprolol. The area under the curve of the high-frequency range (f = 0.18-0.35 Hz) during controlled respiratory rate (f = 0.25 Hz) was used as a quantitative index of parasympathetic activity. Twenty-four male patients with proven coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 60%) were studied 2 weeks after chronic treatment with diltiazem (3 x 60 mg daily) or metoprolol (3 x 50 mg daily) before and after administration of the drug. Twelve patients received diltiazem and 12 patients metoprolol. After administration of diltiazem the peripheral systolic blood pressure was reduced, but the parasympathetic activity was significantly higher than compared with the initial measurement. The same effect was seen for metoprolol, but a significant lower heart rate was present after administration. The relative area under the high-frequency range significantly increased at rest, by 110% after diltiazem and 70% after metoprolol. Diltiazem and metoprolol enhance the vagal influence at the heart, thereby leading to an enhancement of barosensitivity and of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. This action may contribute to the beneficial effects of both drugs in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "17": "The clinical significance of quantitative tilt-table examination with TCD monitoring in the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope is evaluated. A 50-year-old male suffered a neurocardiogenic syncope during tilt-table examination with a strong drop in blood pressure, an increase in cerebrovascular resistance as evidenced by transcranial Doppler monitoring, and a 30-s cardiac asystole, followed by a generalized seizure. No further syncope could be elicited during tilt-table examination after beta-blocker treatment. It was hypothesized that hyperactivity of the left ventricular mechanoreceptors due to increased force of ventricular contraction during a state of reduced venous backstream to the heart was responsible for eliciting the neurocardiogenic syncope. Tilt-table examination with an upright position for at least 45 min enables the diagnosis of a neurocardiogenic syncope to be made with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Several studies have shown that medication with beta-blockers is successful in the treatment of neurocardiogenic syncope. The implantation of cardiac pacemakers should only be considered if medication is not successful.", 
    "18": "Asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and complex ventricular arrhythmias in elderly persons without heart disease should not be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and complex ventricular arrhythmias in elderly persons are associated with an increased incidence of coronary events, primary ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, especially if abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular hypertrophy or silent ischaemia are present. beta-Blockers should be used in the treatment of elderly patients with ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemic or nonischaemic heart disease if there are no contraindications to beta-blocker therapy. I would reserve the use of amiodarone in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in elderly patients who cannot tolerate or who do not respond to beta-blockers. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used in treating elderly patients with ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with congestive heart failure. In patients with ventricular tachycardia or complex ventricular arrhythmias associated with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, I would use beta-blockers plus ACE inhibitors. If elderly patients have life-threatening, recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs, invasive intervention is indicated. Until the results of prospective, randomised, clinical trials evaluating the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator are available, I recommend using the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in elderly patients who have medically refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.", 
    "19": "Exogenous catecholamines have been proved to be active in the reduction of vascular permeability induced by various inflammatory mediators via beta-adrenoceptor activation, but it is not known whether an endogenous beta-adrenergic agonist has any effect. We studied it in skin and lung vessels. The results revealed that an intravenous bolus of isoproterenol (10 micrograms/kg) attenuated platelet-activating factor- and histamine-induced Evans blue dye extravasation in rat dorsal skin, while intraperitoneal administration of beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased the dye extravasation. Blockade of beta-adrenoceptor by propranolol for 12 h noticeably increased wet/dry lung weight ratio, lung water content, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) protein concentration, leukocyte count, and lipoperoxide degradation product malondialdehyde (MDA) content. In isolated perfused lung in vitro, propranolol (2.5 micrograms/ml) had no obvious effects on lung weight gain, fluid filtration coefficient, and pulmonary vascular pressure during the 20-min perfusion compared with control. The results suggested that endogenous beta-adrenergic agonist is an important factor in the maintenance of vascular integrity and the quiescent state of leukocytes, indicating the antiinflammatory role of catecholamines in physiological states and critical illnesses.", 
    "20": "Celiprolol, a novel beta blocker, may be more effective than propranolol in unstable angina pectoris because of both its beta-1-receptor selectivity and its vasodilator property. In the present report 53 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease but uncompromised left ventricular function and with electrocardiographically documented recurrent angina pectoris in spite of bed rest, aspirin, and repeated sublingual administration of nitroglycerin were studied. They were randomized for treatment with equipotent doses of either the nonselective beta blocker propranolol (80 mg/day) or the selective beta blocker with beta-2-agonistic property, celiprolol (200 mg/day) during one week. Angina frequency was higher in the propranolol group (P < 0.01), whereas myocardial oxygen demand as estimated by the double product (DP = SBP x HR, systolic blood pressure x heart rate) was equally reduced by the two beta blockers. Forearm blood flow was essentially higher in the celiprolol group (P < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the beneficial effects of the beta blockers were largely dependent on their effect on peripheral flow, in addition to reduction of the double product. The authors conclude that (1) Both celiprolol and propranolol largely reduce angina pectoris frequency in unstable angina pectoris. (2) Celiprolol contributes to nearly complete relief in three times as many patients as propranolol; after adjustment for double product or for systolic blood pressure plus heart rate it performs even eight times better. (3) The similar effects of the two compounds on the double product and the essentially different effects on peripheral flow support the conclusion that celiprolol exerts its beneficial effect to a large extent through its vasodilator property.",

    "23": "Salbutamol demonstrated a dose-related increase in resting heart rate and tremor and a fall in serum potassium level consistent with beta 2 agonism. On exercise, the hyperkalaemic response was augmented by propranolol compared with placebo consistent with beta 2 blockade: mean difference for delta response (95% CI) PR v PL was 0.60 (0.02 to 1.27) mmol/l. This effect also occurred with salbutamol in a dose-related fashion: S8 v PL 0.33 (0.01 to 0.71) mmol/l, S8 v S2 0.31 (-0.02 to 0.61) mmol/l. Whilst propranolol blunted exercise heart rate in keeping with beta 1 blockade, salbutamol had no effect. Exercise produced an increase in lymphocyte beta 2 receptor binding density (Bmax) which was not affected by salbutamol. Plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline at peak exercise were also unaltered by salbutamol in comparison with placebo.", 
    "24": "In a state of low adrenergic tone at rest salbutamol produces effects consistent with beta 2 agonism. In contrast, in a state of increased adrenergic tone during exercise salbutamol produced beta 2 selective antagonism as evidenced by its effects on exercise-induced hyperkalaemia (beta 2) but not on exercise-induced tachycardia (beta 1). The effects of salbutamol on beta 2 receptor density do not explain its effects on exercise-induced hyperkalaemia since upregulation rather than downregulation was observed. This in vivo phenomenon of partial beta 2 agonist/antagonist activity of salbutamol may be of relevance in the setting of acute asthma if adrenergic tone is increased.",

At heart rates at onset of ischaemia of < 70 beats per minute a high ratio of low to high frequency power accompanied the ischaemic events and was paralleled by a remarkably reduced high frequency power. The high ratio--that is, enhanced sympathetic tone during ischaemia--was mainly found in the early morning. By contrast, ischaemic episodes with heart rates at onset of > or = 70 beats per minute were not associated with significant changes in the parameters of autonomic function.",

In particular, in ischaemic episodes with a low heart rate at onset the neural regulation of the heart plays a part. Apparently, variability in heart rate is not sufficiently modified by beta blockers to prevent all ischaemia. The ischaemia related change in the autonomic nervous system during the early morning is in agreement with previous studies, showing increased cardiovascular risk at this time of the day.",

    "44": "Uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2) has been shown to be capable of increasing transmitter release from the motor nerve accompanied by the potentiation of nerve evoked muscle contraction. In this paper, we have demonstrated that UO2(2+) induced an initial twitch depression followed by a later twitch potentiation in low (0.35 mM) Ca2+ medium. Although UO2(2+) has been identified as a K(+)-channel blocker, we have found it only partially blocked the fast K(+)-current (IK(f) as recorded in the perineurial sheath of the mouse triangularis sterni preparation. Increasing the concentration of UO2(2+) to a high concentration of 0.4 mM did not further inhibit IK(f) but markedly prolonged the duration of the outward current of the nerve terminals. From the time course of its appearance together with the specific inhibition by 4-aminopyridine, dendrotoxin and beta-bungarotoxin, which has been shown to be capable of blocking the K(+)-current of the motor nerve terminal, it was proposed that UO2(2+) prolonged the duration of the nerve terminal spikes by an enhancement of an IK(s)-like current, which was further characterized by its susceptibility to be enhanced by low K+, low Ca2+ and Cd2+ but attenuated by high K+ and high Ca2+. These cation effects not only supported UO2(2+)-induced IK(s) current but also excluded the possibility of an enhancement of Ca(2+)-activated K(+)-current induced by UO2(2+) plus TEA. The significance of this enhancement of IK(s) induced by UO2(2+) has been elucidated by the finding that dendrotoxin inhibited but tetraethylammonium potentiated not only UO2(2+)-induced IK(s) but also UO2(2+)-induced twitch depression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "49": "We investigated the nature of the contraction produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the rat pulmonary artery, and compared it with that produced in the rat aorta. Both ketanserin and ritanserin inhibited 5-HT-induced contraction in the pulmonary artery non-competitively. In contrast, ketanserin competitively antagonized the contraction in the aorta. Bunazosin, a selective alpha 1-blocker, partially inhibited 5-HT-induced contraction in the pulmonary artery, but not in the aorta. In both the pulmonary artery and aorta, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A selective agonist, produced a concentration-dependent contraction. In the pulmonary artery, 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT produced contractions with similar potencies. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT was less potent than 5-HT in the aorta. Bunazosin inhibited 8-OH-DPAT-induced contraction in both vessels. However, pindolol, a 5-HT1A antagonist, did not inhibit 8-OH-DPAT-induced contraction in the pulmonary artery. These results suggest that 5-HT produces contraction via not only 5-HT2 receptor, but also non-5-HT2 receptor (probably alpha 1-adrenoceptor) in the rat pulmonary artery. Furthermore, 8-OH-DPAT does not activate the 5-HT1A receptor to produce a contraction, but does activate other receptors which interact with alpha 1-adrenoceptor.",

After 4-6 weeks rabbits implanted with DEX, CX (lg), and FK+CK (sm) developed hypertension. Those implanted with FK alone (yielding physiological serum concentration of FK), CX (sm), and DEX+RU 38486 did not develop hypertension. Rates of unidirectional influx of Ca2+ measured in rings of excised aortae were in all hypertensive rabbits more than twice those in the control rabbits (implanted with silastic strips not containing any steroids). In all normotensive rabbits, Ca2+ influx rates remained normal. We conclude that, in analogy with the in vitro findings in cultured vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells treated with GC, also in vivo, the elevation of tissue levels of GC causes an increase in the influx rate of Ca2+ in VSM. We propose that this may be the main pathogenic mechanism of GC-induced hypertension.",

The effect of non-selective (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, IBMX; theophylline) and type IV- or type III/IV-selective (rolipram, RP 73401; zardaverine, tolafentrine) phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on human eosinophil functions was investigated. 2. For this purpose human eosinophils were purified from blood of healthy donors by a magnetic cell separation (MACS) technique to a purity > or = 99%. From the stimuli investigated (complement C5a; N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, fMLP; platelet activating factor, PAF; opsonized zymosan) C5a was selected to test the influence of the above mentioned compounds on secretion of granule constituents (eosinophil cationic protein, ECP; eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, EDN) as well as on formation of reactive oxygen species measured by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence in intact cells. For comparison, inhibition of PDE IV activity in the cytosol of disrupted cells, which contains about 75% of total PDE IV activity, was determined. 3. Both theophylline and IBMX inhibited the two cell responses with IC50 values which were in the range of their IC50 values obtained for inhibition of PDE IV activity in the cell-free system. The beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol (1 mumol l-1), which by itself did not substantially influence the two cell responses, only marginally improved the potency of theophylline and IBMX in inhibiting ECP/EDN secretion. Only the IC50 value of IBMX for inhibition of chemiluminescence was lowered by about one order of magnitude in the presence of salbutamol. 4. In contrast, none of the selective PDE inhibitors tested substantially inhibited the two cell responses at concentrations up to 10 mumol l-1. This was surprising because all of the compounds investigated inhibited PDE IV activity in the cell-free system with IC50 values which were at least 30 fold lower than the highest concentration of the compounds used with intact cells. In combination with salbutamol, however, both ECP/EDN secretion and chemiluminescence was inhibited by rolipram and zardaverine with IC50 values similar to the IC50 values for inhibition of PDE IV activity. Although RP 73401 and tolafentrine also inhibited both cell responses in the presence of salbutamol, the potency of these two compounds in inhibiting eosinophil function in intact cells was at least two orders of magnitude lower than would have been expected from the inhibition of PDE IV activity in the cell-free system. 5. These results indicate that (i) C5a-stimulated human eosinophils are sensitive to inhibition by then on-selective PDE inhibitors theophylline and IBMX, (ii) the inhibitory effect of these non-selective PDE inhibitors cannot be mimicked by selective PDE IV or PDE III/IV inhibitors although human eosinophils almost exclusively contain PDE IV; (iii) the selective PDE inhibitors need an additional cyclic AMP trigger like a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist to be effective; but (iv) under the latter conditions inhibition of cell responses in intact cells does not correspond to inhibition of PDE IV activity in the cell-free system.6. We conclude that the non-selective PDE-inhibiting xanthines may inhibit C5a-stimulated human eosinophil responses by other action(s) in addition to PDE IV inhibition, and that inhibition of PDE IV activity in the cell-free system by the selective inhibitors may not generally represent the potency of the compounds in intact cells.", 
    "55": "1. Four putative neurotransmitters (serotonin, substance P, ATP (alpha-beta-methylene-ATP), and vasoactive intestinal peptide, VIP) of the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) innervation were examined for their role in the NANC excitatory neurotransmission in channel catfish intestine after adrenergic and cholinergic blockade. 2. VIP at concentrations ranging from 10(-12)M to 10(-4)M did not produce either a relaxant or a contractile response in these segments. 3. Serotonin, substance P and alpha-beta-methyl-ATP produced contractile responses in a dose-dependent manner. Their EC50 values were 5 x 10(-7)M, 5 x 10(-9)M and 5 x 10(-9)M and 5 x 10(-6)M, respectively. 4. Electrical field stimulation of the intestinal segments produced a predominant excitatory response after complete blockade of adrenergic and cholinergic divisions, suggesting a predominant NANC excitatory innervation. 5. Three types of serotonin receptor antagonists, namely methiothepin (predominantly a 5-HT1 antagonist), ketanserin (a selective 5-HT2 antagonist), methysergide and cyproheptadine (predominantly 5-HT2 blockers) and metoclopramide (a selective 5-HT3 blocker) were tested for their effectiveness against serotonin and EFS-induced contractions. Methiothepin, methysergide, cyproheptadine and metoclopramide produced significant blockade of the response to serotonin, whereas only methiothepin and cyproheptadine produced blockade of EFS-induced response. 6. Three agents tested for substance P blockade, namely spantide, 4-11 fragment of substance P, and methysergide (also a serotonin blocker), did not produce significant inhibition of the response to either substance P or EFS. 7. Suramin at a dose that blocked the ED50 concentration of ATP did not produce a significant blockade of the response to EFS suggesting that ATP-involvement in the NANC-e neurotransmission is unlikely. 8. This study confirmed the involvement of serotonin in the expression of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic excitatory response of the channel catfish intestine.", 
    "56": "The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.001-1 mg/kg, IP), dose-dependently induced mydriasis in conscious rats (ED50 0.088 mg/kg). This response was maximal when measured 10 min after clonidine injection and was of about 30-min duration. The noradrenaline releasing agent, methamphetamine (0.75 mg/kg, IP), also increased pupil diameter. Clonidine (0.03 mg/kg, IP)-induced mydriasis was inhibited in a dose-related fashion by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, idazoxan (0.03-3 mg/kg, IP) and yohimbine (0.03-3 mg/kg, IP), but was unaltered by the alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic antagonists, prazosin (1 and 3 mg/kg, IP) or pindolol (1 and 3 mg/kg, IP). Methamphetamine (0.75 mg/kg, IP)-induced mydriasis was similarly inhibited by idazoxan (1 mg/kg, IP) and yohimbine (1 mg/kg, IP). These data argued strongly that central alpha 2-adrenoceptors are involved in the mediation of mydriasis. The synaptic location of these receptors was determined using DSP-4 (50 mg/kg x 2, IP) to lesion noradrenergic neurones: this produced a 64% depletion of noradrenaline in the midbrain (containing the Edinger-Westphal nucleus responsible for mydriasis) and reduced the mydriatic effect of methamphetamine (0.75 mg/kg, IP) to a similar extent (72%), whereas clonidine mydriasis remained unaltered. Therefore, these results show that the mydriasis responses induced by either clonidine or methamphetamine are mediated by central postsynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "57": "1. The topical application of bradykinin (BK) (0.05-5000 pmol/rat) onto the serosal surface of the urinary bladder in urethane-anaesthetized rats, evoked low amplitude tonic contractions (not exceeding 25 mmHg) or high amplitude (about 50 mmHg), phasic reflex contractions (chemoceptive micturition reflex) which were abolished by bilateral ablation of the pelvic ganglia. In ganglionectomized rats, BK induced only a local, tonic-type contraction. 2. Systemic capsaicin pretreatment (164 mumol kg-1, 4 days before) reduced the incidence of chemoceptive reflex induced by BK (500 pmol/rat) but had no effect on the magnitude of the tonic-type contraction elicited by BK in ganglionectomized rats. Indomethacin (11 mumol kg-1, 20 min before) reduced the incidence but not the amplitude of the reflex contractions induced by topical application of BK (500 pmol/rat). In ganglionectomized rats, indomethacin (11 mumol kg-1, 20 min before) decreased the amplitude of the tonic contraction evoked by BK. Indomethacin did not affect the chemoceptive reflex induced by topical application of capsaicin (15 nmol/rat) onto the bladder. 3. Intrathecal administration of the tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists, RP 67,580 (10 nmol/rat) or SR 140,333 (10 nmol/rat), abolished the chemoceptive reflex induced by BK without modifying the magnitude of the tonic contraction. SR 140,333 (10 nmol/rat) also abolished the occurrence of the chemoceptive reflex induced by capsaicin. 4. Intravenous administration of the B2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140 (35 nmol kg-1, 10 min before) abolished the reflex and local effects induced by BK on bladder motility but failed to modify the chemoceptive reflex induced by topical application of capsaicin (15 nmol/rat). 5. Intrathecal administration of Hoe 140 (10 nmol/rat) reduced the incidence of the chemoceptive reflex induced by BK but had no effect on the amplitude of the local motor response. Likewise, Hoe 140(10 nmol/rat, i.t.) reduced the incidence of reflex bladder contractions induced by topical application of capsaicin (15 nmol/rat) without affecting the magnitude of the tonic-type contraction.6. These findings indicate that BK stimulates motility through B2 receptors in the rat urinary bladder.BK activates the reflex response by stimulating capsaicin-sensitive afferent nerves with a contribution from prostanoids. At the spinal cord level, tachykinin NK1 and BK B2 receptors could also be involved in the chemoceptive reflex induced by BK or capsaicin.",

Sixteen patients, mean age 59 +/- 13 years (range 36 to 80 years) were divided into two groups after in initial catheter study performed under temporary VDD pacing between March 1990 and April 1993. In group I (n = 11), the gradient was decreased by more than 50% whereas in group II (n = 5), the gradient was unchanged or reduced by less than 50%.

[3H]Dopamine uptake as a function of time was close to linear for at least 8 min, whereas [3H]WIN 35,428 binding had reached equilibrium within 1 min and remained at its plateau value for at least 20 min. The following inhibitors were tested in uptake and binding assays run in parallel with the same synaptosomal preparation: cocaine, WIN 35,428, benztropine, nomifensine, mazindol, methylphenidate, N-[1-(2-benzo[b]-thiophenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (BTCP), Lu 19-005 (Indatraline), 1-(2-(di(4-fluorophenyl)-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-2-propyl)piperazine (GBR 12909), 1-(2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-2-propyl)piperazine (GBR 12935) and 7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo [1,2-a]quinoxaline (CGS 12066B). When present together with [3H]dopamine or [3H]WIN 35,428 for 8 min, the observed binding IC50 values were generally higher (average 1.4-fold) than the uptake IC50 values, with a significant y-axis intercept in linear regression analysis of binding on uptake IC50. For slowly equilibrating inhibitors, estimates of uptake IC50 values were overestimates, and relatively lower values were obtained by monitoring [3H]dopamine uptake for 1 min only during the last minute of the 8-min presence of inhibitor; under these conditions, binding over uptake IC50 ratios were on the average 2.3. Kinetic calculations, taking into account both radioligand and inhibitor equilibration kinetics, indicated that the latter comparison between binding and uptake measurements was most relevant, and suggested the involvement of complexities beyond simple competitive inhibition of dopamine transport, such as different binding domains for substrate and blocker recognition, or spare receptors for blockers. The present data indicate that binding over uptake IC50 ratios should be interpreted with caution, depending on the experimental conditions used to measure these ratios.", 
    "60": "Congestive left heart failure can be treated using three main strategies: change preload to optimize the Frank-Starling relationship, decrease after-load to reduce external work and increase cardiac contractility by inotropic stimulation. The third option is reviewed in this article, which discusses the pharmacological and clinical effects of different inotropic drugs as known in 1994. It is concluded that digitalis should be considered apart from other inotropic drugs. Even when in sinus rhythm, digitalis seems reasonable as an adjuvans to after-load reduction and diuretics. Chronic use of other inotropic drugs for congestive left heart failure is not recommended.",

Because beta-adrenoceptor agonists and corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of asthma we have studied the effects of these medicines on the growth of airway smooth muscle. These agents were incubated with bovine airway smooth muscle cells for 40 h for measurement of thymidine incorporation and 64 h for measurement of cell counts. Salbutamol inhibited thymidine incorporation (IC50 = 60 nM) and led to a reduction in cell number (IC50 = 10 nM). At 10 microM there was a 14.6 +/- 2.6% reduction in cell number. Salmeterol also inhibited the growth of the airway smooth muscle cells but the effect did not plateau at 10 microM. At this concentration there was an 89.5 +/- 3.6% reduction in thymidine incorporation and a 44.1 +/- 5.2% reduction in cell number. Cortisol and beclomethasone dipropionate were more potent than salbutamol in inhibiting thymidine incorporation with IC50 values of 5 nM and 0.2 nM respectively. Cortisol 100 nM led to a 16.6 +/- 6.5% reduction and beclomethasone dipropionate 3 nM led to a 17.8 +/- 5.8% reduction in cell number. If similar effects occur in man and in vivo, these medicines could act directly on airway smooth muscle to inhibit the development of hyperplasia.",

Noradrenaline, phenylephrine but not clonidine, stimulated secretion in a concentration-related manner. Noradrenaline responses were antagonised by alprenolol (20 microM) but not phentolamine (10 microM) whilst phenylephrine was antagonised by phentolamine (10 microM), prazosin (5 microM) but not yohimbine (5 microM), alprenolol or tetrodotoxin (1 microM). Replacement of mucosal Cl- abolished the phenylephrine response. Combined stimulation with maximum concentrations of phenylephrine and isoprenaline gave a response which was not greater than that to either agonist alone but it did involve both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors as judged from the effects of alprenolol and phentolamine either alone or combined. Submaximum concentrations of the two agonists did show additive responses. The results show that alpha 1- but not alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists stimulate bicarbonate secretion and may act on the same transport mechanism as beta-adrenoceptor agonists.

For quantification of receptor density with compartment models by adjustment of rate constants, an 'input function' is required which consists of the integral of the concentration of unmodified ligand in arterial plasma over time. A discrepancy in the literature regarding metabolic stability of [11C]I prompted us to study metabolism in rats by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) of trichloroacetic acid extracts of arterial plasma after i.v. injection of [11C]I (> 11.1 TBq/mmol, 11 MBq/kg). Some plasma samples were also directly applied to an internal-surface reversed-phase (ISRP) column. In parallel experiments, tritiated [11C]I was employed and methanol extracts of arterial plasma were analyzed by straight-phase TLC. The three methods were in excellent agreement. Unmodified [11C]I decreased from > 98.5% (3H) or > 99.9% (11C) initially to 57 +/- 7% at 80 min post injection due to formation of two polar metabolites. Using the RP-HPLC method, no metabolism was detectable in humans up to 30 min after injection of [11C]I (1851 MBq). Deproteinization of plasma with acetonitrile resulted in the formation of a radioactive species (artifact) which eluted immediately after the void volume in RP-HPLC and which could be mistakenly interpreted as a metabolite.

Our results support earlier findings, obtained with the use of fast Fourier transformation, that in supine subjects spectral components of R-R interval variability at around 0.1 Hz are mediated mainly by cholinergic mechanisms. Therefore, the use of the LF component as sympathetic index appears questionable.",

In this study, we have investigated the acute anti-inflammatory effects of a short-acting (salbutamol) and a long-acting (salmeterol) beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist on 111In-accumulation and oedema formation in allergic and mediator-induced inflammation in guinea pig skin. Both salbutamol and salmeterol inhibited 111In-eosinophil accumulation induced by platelet-activating factor and in a passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction when co-injected with the inflammatory stimuli or when given as a 30 min pretreatment. The inhibition was reversed by DL-propranolol, but not D-propranolol. Systemic treatment with salbutamol inhibited 111In-eosinophil accumulation and oedema formation when given as a 15 min, but not as a 3 h, pretreatment. In contrast, salmeterol was effective when given at both times. We conclude that a long duration of action of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists is not necessary to demonstrate acute anti-inflammatory effects on eosinophil accumulation in guinea pig skin.",

In contrast, ICI-118,551 and procaterol were more potent in the lungs than in the heart. ICI-118,551 inhibited 18F uptake in cerebellum (predominantly beta 2-adrenoceptors) more potently than in cerebral cortex (predominantly beta 1-adrenoceptors). Stereoselectivity of the in vivo binding was demonstrated since S-(-)-propranolol inhibited uptake in target tissues more effectively than R-(+)-propranolol. Myocardial and cerebral imaging may be hampered by poor heart-to-lung contrast and low signal-to-noise ratios, but [18F]S-fluorocarazolol seems suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) of pulmonary beta-adrenoceptors.",

To examine the regional haemodynamic basis of arterial pressure lability seen after sino-aortic baroreceptor denervation (SAD), simultaneous beat-to-beat recordings of arterial pressure and indices of regional blood flows (Doppler probes around the subdiaphragmatic and lower abdominal aortae and the superior mesenteric artery) were performed in the same conscious rats (n = 7) before, 1 and 14 days after SAD. 2. Acute SAD increased arterial pressure, decreased regional blood flows and vascular conductances, and potentiated the depressor and vasodilator effects of ganglionic blockade with trimethaphan, suggesting sympathetic overactivity. All parameters chronically returned to or near normal. 3. Both acute and chronic SAD increased the variability of arterial pressure and of regional conductances. Arterial pressure lability was characterized by a mixture of depressor and pressor events which were associated with regional vasodilatations and vasoconstrictions, respectively. This haemodynamic pattern was not affected by acute beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol. 4. In conscious rats, the baroreceptor reflex acts to buffer the spontaneous variability of regional vascular conductances and thereby stabilizes arterial pressure. Sino-aortic baroreceptor denervation-induced arterial pressure lability does not depend on the level of sympathetic activation, and is determined by the relative contribution of depressor and pressor events accompanied by extensive vasodilatations and vasoconstrictions, respectively. Vasodilatations are not caused by the stimulation of vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors.",

We performed a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of the longacting beta-blocker bisoprolol once daily and the short acting nitrate, isosorbide dinitrate, three times daily in the reduction of anginal complaints in daily life and under stress. Thirty patients were enrolled in a double-blind randomised cross-over study. Both bisoprolol and isosorbide dinitrate were effective in reducing anginal attacks and nitroglycerin consumption significantly, but bisoprolol was significantly more effective than isosorbide dinitrate. Bisoprolol improved the workload during bicycle exercise testing significantly, but the improvement with isosorbide dinitrate was not significant. Despite the reduction in maximal rate pressure product, bisoprolol was significantly (P < 0.05) more effective at improving total workload and reducing the time to onset of angina than isosorbide dinitrate. The rate pressure product did not change significantly with isosorbide dinitrate. In this study, bisoprolol 10 mg once daily was more effective and caused less side effects than isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg three times a day. It seems questionable if monotherapy of isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg t.i.d is an adequate drug regime for stable angina pectoris.",

Men undergoing a weight-reduction intervention were able to lose more weight (5.9 kg) than women (3.1 kg), P \u2a7d 05. Men also had a greater percentage of wright loss and a greater reduction in body mass index (BMI), although not significantly so.

    "92": "A large body of evidence indicates that brain monoamines are involved in the pathogenesis of mental depression, as well as in the mechanism of action of most antidepressant treatments. The present report shows that long-term exposure to imipramine (IMI) or fluoxetine (FLX) was equally potent in preventing the escape deficits produced in rats by repeated unavoidable shocks. The acute administration of SCH 23390, a selective D1 dopamine receptor blocker, shortly before the inescapable shock session, entirely prevented IMI effect on escape performance, but only partially prevented that of FLX. Moreover, pindolol (an antagonist of beta-adrenoceptors and of serotonin 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors) completely antagonized the efficacy of FLX in preventing escape deficits, whereas it did not effect the activity of IMI. The acute administration of propranolol failed to alter the effect of either antidepressant. It was concluded that in rats, the efficacy of IMI in counteracting the stress-induced behavioral sequelae is mainly mediated by the activation of D1 dopamine receptors, whereas that of FLX is largely dependent upon the stimulation of post-synaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors. Finally, the effects of the two drugs appear to be totally unrelated to activation of beta-adrenoceptors.",

This study investigated the effects of chronic treatment with carvedilol, a beta-blocking agent with an alpha-blocking activity, on blood pressure, endothelium-dependent relaxation and the endothelial structure of the mesenteric resistance artery in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). 2. Chronic treatment with carvedilol at a dose range of 30-120 mg/kg per day lowered systolic blood pressure of SHRSP from 234.9 +/- 3.3 to 198.7 +/- 3.1 mmHg at 16 weeks of age. 3.

The structural abnormality of endothelium was observed in the preparation from SHRSP. The abnormality could be prevented by the antihypertensive treatment. 4. These results suggest that the impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation in the preparation from SHRSP is due to the corelease of an endothelium-derived contracting factor which is considered to be a product of cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid cascade and that the impairment can be prevented by the antihypertensive treatment with carvedilol.",

(3) to correlate the observed clinical results to the cellular profile of preoperative conjunctival biopsies. We presented in a first step the results of a retrospective analysis including 88 trabeculectomies performed between January '93 and April '95 in 62 GCAO patients older than 40 years and without any previous ocular surgery. The mean age of patients was 66,8 years (41 to 87 years).

    "101": "An increasing number of dental patients are taking beta-adrenergic blockers for the treatment of hypertension or angina pectoris. If epinephrine-containing local anesthetics are administered to such patients, interactions between epinephrine and the beta-blocking agent may induce cardiovascular complications. We assessed in volunteers the effects of intraoral injection with 2% lidocaine containing 1:80,000 epinephrine (L-E) on cardiac function after pretreatment with the beta-blocking agent pindolol. M-Mode echocardiography was used for the assessment. The injection of L-E after administration of pindolol did not alter cardiac preload, whereas it reduced the stroke volume, due to an increase in afterload and a decrease in myocardial contractility. Reductions in stroke volume and heart rate led to a decrease in cardiac output. Because total peripheral vascular resistance increased markedly, blood pressure was elevated despite the reduced cardiac output. These results suggest that cardiac function of dental patients on beta-blocker therapy can be adversely affected by epinephrine-containing local anesthetics. Therefore, when such an anesthetic solution has to be used in patients on beta-blocker therapy, careful systemic monitoring is needed.", 
    "102": "Desensitization of G-protein coupled receptors following agonist occupancy is accompanied by two temporally distinguishable cellular trafficking phenomena of the receptors referred to as sequestration and down regulation. For the beta2-adrenergic receptor, sequestration occurs within minutes of agonist binding and results in a reversible internalization and loss of cell surface receptor binding. With longer occupancy, greater than 1 hour, down regulation results in a variable loss of the complement of cellular receptors. Here we compare the two methods that have been used to monitor these receptor changes, competition of whole cell hydrophobic ligand binding (125I-pindolol) with a hydrophilic ligand (CGP-12177) and flow cytometry quantification of immunologically tagged beta2-adrenergic receptor. While both methods give reliable results, we show that because of a 1:500 partitioning of the hydrophilic ligand into cells, slightly different conditions should be used to assess basally or agonist stimulated sequestered receptor levels. Using a sequestration defective beta2-adrenergic receptor mutant we demonstrate that even though sequestration and down regulation behave as independent processes, sequestration can significantly affect the rate at which receptors are lost by the down regulatory process by removing receptors from the pool of down regulating receptors. A mathematical model expressing these relationships is provided.",

    "104": "The influence of aging on the hepatic metabolism of propranolol, i.e. conjugation, side-chain oxidation and ring oxidation, was investigated in 32 in-patients aged 30 to 84 yrs. Plasma propranolol concentration and main urinary metabolites [propranolol glucuronide (PPLG), naphthoxylactic acid (NLA), and 4-hydroxypropranolol (40HP)] were determined after a single oral dose of 20 mg propranolol. There were significant correlations between age and 1) maximum propranolol concentration, 2) area under the plasma concentration-time curve, and 3) elimination half-life. The apparent oral clearance of propranolol was inversely correlated with age. Partial metabolic clearance (PMC) to 40HP (ring oxidation) and PMC to NLA (side-chain oxidation) were significantly correlated with age, while PMC to PPLG was not. These observations suggest that there are age-related reductions in two oxidizing capacities, while there is no significant influence of aging on the conjugating capacity. The age-related reduction in oral clearance of propranolol may be mainly caused by the decline in the capacity of two different oxidation pathways.",

Subjects treated with the placebo showed no change in ocular pressure and a significant decrease in retinal vessel width over time especially in the right eye. Subjects treated with timolol had an increase in retinal vessel width compared to the placebo group significant especially for the superior temporal vein. Multivariate analyses indicated that the increase of retinal vessel width was not associated mainly with the ocular pressure on treatment or decrease in ocular pressure on treatment.",

    "117": "In this study we examined 278 patients as to the effect of thyroidal dysfunctions upon late-potential parameters in high-resolution ECG (HR-ECG). It could be demonstrated that both hyper- and hypothyroidism tend to produce late potentials. It is remarkable that even \"subclinical\" dysfunctions reveal significant alterations in HR-ECG. As late potentials represent a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias these results are an additional indication that already \"subclinical\" dysfunctions of thyroid gland call for an appropriate therapy. In hyperthyroidism late potentials may be eliminated rapidly by propranolol even in low dosages.", 
    "118": "It has long been known that beta-receptor blocking agents, including mainly cardioselective compounds, have favourable effects on tachyarrhythmias of various origins. They are the only substances known so far in the post-infarction phase to reduce significantly sudden cardiac deaths and to lower the rate of recurrent infarctions. High-risk patients seem to benefit most from the application of cardioselective beta blockers. In the acute infarction phase as well, beta-receptor blockers display favourable effects in the majority of patients, especially as they reduce the myocardial-infarct size and lower the tendency to arrhythmias by protecting the heart from sympathetic stimulation. The favourable effect on the variability of the heart rate must be stressed. Furthermore, the early application of beta-receptor blockers is recommended today not only in the event of hyperkinetic reactivity, but also and particularly in so-called high-risk patients, although always respecting the contra-indication. In these patients, mortality is reduced markedly in the long-term treatment.", 
    "119": "Beta-blockade has been shown to improve cardiac response to catecholamines in heart failure but cellular mechanisms of the improvement are unknown. The effect on left ventricular function of a 14 day propranolol treatment was studied in seven treated and eight non-treated rabbits with experimental heart failure. All animals were subjected to a volume (aortic insufficiency) plus pressure (aortic constriction) overload and were instrumented with a left ventricular catheter and ultrasonic crystals measuring anteroposterior left ventricular diameter. Beta-adrenoceptors were measured using 125I-Cyanopindolol in crude membranes. With isoproterenol, the heart rate was slower in treated rabbits than in non-treated rabbits (p < 0.005) and isoproterenol increased more systolic diameter shortening in treated than in non-treated rabbits (p < 0.05). With norepinephrine, for matched pressures, % delta D increased in the treated group but it did not change in the non-treated group. This improvement of ventricular function was due, in a large part, to an increased diastolic response to norepinephrine: end-diastolic diameter increased in the treated group but not in the non-treated group. In contrast with the improved ventricular response to catecholamines, beta-adrenergic receptor density in the treated group was identical to that of the non-treated group (27.8 fmoles/mg/proteins) and was significantly lower than that of normal rabbits (58.2 fmoles/mg, p < 0.01). The improvement of ventricular response to catecholamines appears to be due to a myocardial protection by propranolol against the toxic effect of catecholamines in heart failure and not, at least in this model, to an up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "120": "The influence of a single oral dose of nicardipine 30 mg on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol 80 mg given as a conventional release formulation and as a slow release formulation was studied in two separate groups of 12 healthy volunteers. Nicardipine doubled the area under the curve (AUC) and Cmax of propranolol when given as a conventional formulation, but increased it only slightly when given as a slow release formulation. This pharmacokinetic interaction did not result in clinically relevant changes in pharmacodynamic responses. These results indicate that the enhancement of the bioavailability of propranolol by coadministration of nicardipine is dependent on the delivery rate of propranolol, suggesting that the interaction is mainly due to short-term haemodynamic effects of nicardipine leading to saturation of hepatic enzymes or functional shunting.", 
    "121": "Although several reports suggest that intermediate to high doses of propranolol (80-160 and 200-600 mg/day) can effectively treat aggressive behavior in dementia, significant side effects can occur at these doses. To minimize these side effects, we treated and followed-up a series of 12 demented patients, whose caregivers sought medical help for their disruptive, aggressive behavior, with low-dose propranolol monotherapy (10-80 mg/day). Assessment measures obtained at baseline and during treatment by caregiver interview included ordinal ratings of aggression severity, the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI), and the California Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ). The aggression ratings showed that low-dose propranolol effectively reduced aggression in eight of 12 patients (67%) within 2 weeks of treatment and remained effective for the duration of follow-up (1 to 14 months). Subscales of the CMAI showed responders to have significant reductions in physical and verbal aggression/agitation and in pacing/wandering. These results suggest that low-dose propranolol should be further studied for treating aggression or agitation in demented patients.", 
    "122": "The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine has in several previous studies been found to produce anticonflict effects comparable to those produced by the benzodiazepines (BDZ) in rat punished conflict models. In this and a following paper we have tried to elucidate the neurochemical mechanisms underlying these effects in a modified Vogel's drinking conflict test. Since yohimbine previously has been demonstrated to interfere both with noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) neurochemistry, and, in addition, shows affinity for the BDZ binding site, we have focused on the putative involvement of these neuronal systems in the yohimbine-induced anticonflict effect. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (10 micrograms/kg, i.p.) completely antagonized the anticonflict effect of yohimbine (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.), whereas the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist ST 587 (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect. The anticonflict effect of yohimbine was totally abolished also following lesioning of NA neurons with 6-hydroxy-dopamine. A high dose of the mixed beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (8.0 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a partial blockade of the yohimbine-induced effect in intact animals, whereas the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) had no significant effect and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin instead potentiated the anticonflict action. The anticonflict effect of yohimbine was dose-dependently antagonized also by the 5-HT precursor L-5-hydroxytryptophan (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.). The BDZ receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg, p.o.), as well as Ro 15-4513 (1.0 mg/kg, p.o.), a partial inverse agonist at BDZ receptors, partly, but significantly, counteracted the yohimbine-induced anticonflict effect, whereas low doses of both the chloride channel blocker picrotoxin and the GABAA antagonist bicuculline only tended to counteract the yohimbine effect. Taken together, the results in the present behavioral paper indicate that the anticonflict effect of yohimbine involves both increased NA and decreased 5-HT activity, and that direct or indirect activation of BDZ receptors may also be involved. Neurochemical findings related to these behavioral results are presented in a following paper.", 
    "123": "Intravenous injection of 3-33 nmol/kg of substance P (SP) caused pressor and tachycardic responses in anesthetized rats. The responses were not blocked by a ganglion nicotinic receptor antagonist or by pithing. Pretreatment with reserpine blocked both responses. beta-Adrenoceptor blockade attenuated only the tachycardic response, and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade attenuated only the pressor response. These findings indicated that the effects of SP to increase blood pressure and heart rate are due to sympathetic ganglion stimulation. Studies with adrenalectomized rats showed that stimulation of the adrenals by SP contributes to both responses but makes a greater contribution to the tachycardic response. These observations raise the possibility that the tachykinin innervation of sympathetic ganglia and the adrenal medulla may be involved in the local regulation of blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "124": "The authors describe a 62 year-old white male who was diagnosed as autoimmune hyperthyroidism and treated with methimazole and atenolol. Ten days later he showed itching, jaundice and choluria. All drugs were discontinued. The patient was given radioactive iodine. Two months later direct serum bilirubin levels reached 35 mg%. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram evidenced normal extrahepatic biliary ducts. The percutaneous liver biopsy showed marked cholestasis specially in the centrolobular zone with a slight infiltrate of mononuclear cells in the portal areas. Together with the liver disease the patient presented an anemic syndrome. Bone marrow aspiration showed rich cellularity, Perls staining showed 70% sideroblasts, with 10% ringed sideroblasts and increased extracorpuscular iron. The patient's evolution was satisfactory. Twenty months after the beginning of the disease clinical and biochemical tests were normal. A new bone marrow aspiration rendered normal. Hepatic cholestasis suffered by our patient was probably due to an adverse reaction of methimazole. Physiopathology of reversible sideroblastic anemia is discussed.", 
    "125": "Plasma glucose concentrations were measured in: 1) conscious and anesthetized rats during an iv glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and 2) conscious and anaesthetized phentolamine/propranolol blocked rats during an IVGTT. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine (120 mg.kg-1) or pentobarbitone (60 mg.kg-1) ip at -30 min of the beginning of the IVGTT, which was followed by 2 injections of the anesthetic agents at intervals of 30 min. Propranolol (2 mg.kg-1) was given ip at -25 and -5 min. An iv infusion of phentolamine (0.015 mg.min-1) was started at -20 min and continued up to the end of the experiment. During the IVGTT, the anesthetized rats showed a moderate hyperglycemic response to glucose load compared to conscious animals (ketamine: p < 0.01 at 5 min; and p < 0.05 at 10-20 min; pentobarbitone: p < 0.05 at 5-20 min). The hyperglycemic response to glucose administration in the conscious rats was not affected by adrenergic blockade (p > 0.05). While in ketamine anesthetized rats the increased glucose response was abolished by adrenergic blockade (p < 0.05 at 5-10 min), this effect was not seen in pentobarbitone anesthetized animals. These results suggest the existence of an inhibitory tone on insulin secretion and a glycogenolytic response in ketamine anesthetized rats, probably mediated by adrenergic inervation of the pancreas and liver and by circulating catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.", 
    "126": "The cardiovascular effects of the centrally injected D-arginine were investigated in the conscious rat chronically instrumented with cisternal, arterial, and venous cannulae, as well as an electromagnetic flow probe around the superior mesenteric artery, renal artery, or terminal aorta (hindquarter). Intracisternal injection of D-arginine (10 mumol) increased arterial blood pressure and hindquarter flow lasting for 60 min or more. Previous injection of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol (2 mg/kg, I.V.), markedly attenuated the hindquarter vasodilation caused by D-arginine; this response suggests the release of adrenaline. Peripheral resistance, calculated as arterial pressure divided by regional flow, increased in both the superior mesenteric artery (60%) and the renal artery (45%) 5 min after intracisternal injection of D-arginine. In the hindquarter, however, peripheral resistance decreased by 35% and arterial pressure increased by 25%. The pressor effect was significantly attenuated by producing ganglionic blockade with chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg, I.V.). The total peripheral blood flow increased from 12.9 to 15.9 ml/min/100 g body weight. This response indicates that the pressor effect of D-arginine is due to an increase of cardiac output rather than of peripheral resistance. Centrally administered D-arginine appears to activate the sympatho-adrenal system, especially the release of adrenaline.", 
    "127": "The experience with prophylactic therapy for cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia was retrospectively reviewed by questionnaire. Data was collected from 31 patients, aged 2.9-21.75 years who reported a mean of nine attacks per year. Eleven patients had utilized prophylactic therapy. Parental assessment of benefit was recorded. Propranolol was the most effective agent with reported benefit in four of six cases, other antimigraine agents were deemed effective in two of seven cases. Anti-convulsants and antidepressants were not considered useful. Homeopathic and vitamin supplements were thought to be beneficial in three of six cases. Prophylaxis was less likely to be beneficial in the more severe cases of CVS, but was of benefit in those patients whose attacks were precipitated by infection or who had features consistent with migraine. Prophylactic therapy with propranolol or serotonin receptor antagonists should be considered in children with frequent or severe symptoms.", 
    "128": "A method for the detection and identification of penbutolol and its metabolites in human body fluid by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was established. The urine was extracted with diethyl ether-isopropanol and the plasma was extracted with Sep-Pak column. After TMS derivatization the sample was analyzed with GC-MSD. Six metabolites of penbutolol were found in urine sample. The recovery was 90.83% for urine and 85.88% for plasma. The detection limit of penbutolol was 5 pg.", 
    "129": "Two case reports of bilateral granulomatous anterior uveitis are described in patients with open angle glaucoma treated with metripranolol 0.6% eye drops. Several cases have been described in the United Kingdom and recently in the United States. In my opinion this reaction is not so uncommon as thought. Possible causes of this phenomenon are proposed keeping in mind that a hypotensive drug can cause intra ocular pressure rise. The incidence of similar cases seems to increase.", 
    "130": "Hypothalamic mechanisms of blood calcium homeostasis and their functional heterogeneity were investigated in rats. Electrical and chemical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) induced hypocalcemia. The hypocalcemic effect of PVN stimulation was suppressed by vagotomy of the thyroid/parathyroid branches, while that of LHA and VMH stimulation was eliminated by gastric vagotomy. Immobilization (IMB) stress elicited hypocalcemia through VMH-gastric vagal activation. Both IMB- and LHA stimulation-induced hypocalcemia was antagonized by muscarinic antagonist and histamine H2 blocker. The former was also blocked by alpha-blocker and gastrin release inhibitor, while the latter was antagonized by an beta-blocker. The results suggest that hypothalamic nuclei are involved in regulation of blood calcium homeostasis via the gastric or thyroid/parathyroid vagus. Muscarinic, histamine H2, adrenergic and gastrin receptors mediate the hypocalcemic effect of the hypothalamo-vagal activation depending on behavioral conditions and receptor subtypes.", 
    "131": "Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated that microcalorimetry is an appropriate method for estimating the physiological function of isolated rat brown adipocytes. In the present study, to elucidate the mode of action of typical and atypical beta-adrenoceptors on heat production of this cell, the effect of novel adrenergic beta 3-agonists was compared with that of other typical adrenergic reagents by direct microcalorimetry. Isoproterenol and beta 3-agonists, BRL37344, ICI215001, and CGP12177, increased heat production in a dose-dependent manner, however, phenylephrine had no effect. Propranolol and pindolol did not increase the heat production but attenuated the effect of isoproterenol and BRL37344 in a dose-dependent manner. Molar IC50 values of propranolol and pindolol for BRL37344 were about 10(-5) and 3 x 10(-6) M, respectively, whereas those of the two antagonists for isoproterenol were about 3 x 10(-7)M. The pA2 values by Schild analysis of propranolol vs. isoproterenol and BRL37344 were 7.91 and 6.13, respectively. These results suggest that heat production may be regulated via both beta 3- and typical beta-adrenoceptors in brown adipocytes.", 
    "132": "For the last 50 years the therapeutic possibilities in treating hyperthyroidism have comprised not only the reversible method of antithyroidal drugs but also the 2 irreversible methods viz. surgery and application of radioiodine. Of late beta-adrenergic blockers turned out to be an important adjuvant therapy enabling an early reduction in the hyper-sympathicomimetic condition of Graves's disease. Moreover, R-propranolol will in itself inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. The selection of the method of choice is difficult to determine in the individual case requiring both endocrinologic knowledge and specific laboratory findings. Thanks to a striking reduction in the use of conventional antithyroid drugs it has also become possible to decrease the side effects markedly. In spite of far reaching investigations no reliable marker could be found in predicting long lasting remission following discontinuation of antithyroidal drugs. Not withstanding the enormous progress achieved in the pathogenesis and innummerable immunologic findings we are still lacking a causal therapy in treating Graves' disease."
