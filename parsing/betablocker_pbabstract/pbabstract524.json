Previous experiments have shown that concurrent administration of dl exprenolol or dl or d propranolol prevent the disarray but not the hypertrophy, suggesting that membrane stabilization and not beta-adrenergic blockade may be responsible for modifying the actions of triac. In order to clarify this, further experiments have been carried out whereby timolol, a beta-blocking agent with minimal or no membrane stabilizing activity, and procainamide, a pure membrane stabilizing compound, have been administered with triac. Timolol had no effect, but procainamide reduced the level of disarray and the hypertrophy to a minor degree. The results have thus confirmed the proposal that membrane stabilization is of major importance in modifying the actions of triac.", 
    "1": "The Ca++-antagonist nifedipine has been successfully employed in the treatment of non-gravid hypertension, and was found to inhibit uterine contractions in the perimenstrual period, as well as during premature labour in animal models. The use of antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy introduces the possibility of iatrogenic foetal distress. It has been established that nifedipine crosses the placental barrier in the sheep and causes a fall in mean arterial pressure and tachycardia in both the ewe and the foetus. This paper examines the effects of nifedipine on the foetus when administered to the pregnant ewe. Catheters and electrodes were implanted by surgical procedures in 15 ewes and foetal lambs between days 118 and 122 of gestation. The redistribution of foetal blood flow was measured by the radioactive microsphere injection technique. The infusion of nifedipine caused a 9% increase in the combined ventricular output (CVO) from 446 to 509 ml/min/kg in the foetus. Foetal lung blood flow increased from 29 +/- 6 to 69 +/- 14 ml/min/kg while figures for the skeletal muscle flow were 109 +/- 34 and 141 +/- 41.6 ml/min/kg. Heart and brain blood flow, expressed as percentages of CVO showed variations of 4.3 and 5.6 per cent, respectively. Blood flow in the gut, placental membranes, skin, kidney and spleen was reduced. The present results show that nifedipine, in addition to its known effects causes a redistribution of the foetal circulation.", 
    "2": "The ratio systolic pressure--telesystolic volume (SP-TV) was determined in 39 patients with II degree hypertension by M-type echocardiography and simultaneous measurement of the arterial pressure before and at the end of the I and VI month of treatment with a cardioselective beta-blocker without a sympathicomimetic activity. The initial values of the ratio SP-TV did not differ from those of healthy persons. At the end of the first month of treatment the ratio was reliably lower (p less than 0.001) and at the end of the sixth month it increased but remained reliably lower than that of healthy persons (p less than 0.045). At the end of the sixth month the left ventricular muscular mass was reliably reduced. A large up to significant negative correlation was established between the ratio SP-TV and the left ventricular muscular mass before and after the treatment. The left ventricular pump function showed favorable dynamics.", 
    "3": "Nadolol, a non-cardioselective beta adrenoreceptor blocking agent, has been reported to decrease portal pressure without affecting liver function in cirrhotic patients treated for 1 month. There were no data about the long-term effects of nadolol on liver function. In 11 patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension galactose eliminating capacity, aminopyrine metabolic capacity, ICG clearance and IGC intrinsic hepatic clearance according to the \"parallel tube\" model were measured before and after 6 months of treatment with nadolol at a dose reducing resting heart rate by approximately 25%. No significant variation in any of these parameters was found. Thus 6 months of continuous oral administration of nadolol did not further impair liver function in cirrhotics.", 
    "4": "We investigated the participation of a sympathetic component in the abdominal contortions induced by intraperitoneal injection of 0.6% acetic acid in the mouse. The beta blocker propranolol (4 mg/kg, sc) caused a small significant (19%) blockade of the contortions but strongly potentiated (greater than 80%) the effect of indomethacin (30% at 5 mg/kg, sc). Significant inhibition of writhing was also observed with sympatholytics such as guanethidine (27% at 30 mg/kg, sc) and by a specific dopamine-I antagonist, SCH 23390 (62% at 400 micrograms/kg, sc). Tyramine, which releases sympathomimetic amines, and cocaine, which partially blocks the uptake of amines, potentiated acetic acid writhing. Intraperitoneal administration of noradrenaline (187 micrograms/kg)potentiated acetic acid-induced writhing. These results are consistent with the suggestion of Nakamura and Ferreira (1) that inflammatory nociception has a dual component: one mediated by cyclooxygenase metabolites and another by sympathetic amines, possibly acting through a DA-1 type receptor.", 
    "5": "The pharmacological properties of [3H]-WB4101, [3H]-clonidine and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding in chick brain membranes display the characteristics known for alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic binding sites, respectively. Kinetic studies performed at different embryonic and post-hatching ages have shown one binding component for each one of the above radioactive ligands. The ontogeny of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta binding sites was studied in cerebral hemispheres, optic lobes, brain stem and cerebellum. In all brain regions studied, the development of alpha 2 binding sites precedes that of alpha 1 and beta, and a very significant decrease of alpha 2 number was observed in the cerebellum, brain stem and optic lobes afterwards. The autoradiographic localization of adrenergic receptors was studied in the optic lobes and cerebellum. In the optic lobes the superficial layers of stratum griseum and fibrosum showed a strong selective labelling of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta binding sites and the strong selective labelling of alpha 2 binding sites extended to the layer of stratum opticum. Among the nuclei located in the optic lobe only the nucleus mesencephalis lateralis pars dorsalis (MLD) exhibited a strong selective labelling for alpha 1 binding sites while, for beta binding sites, not only the MLD, but also the nucleus isthmic pars parvocellularis (Ipc) and the nucleus isthmic pars magnocellularisa (Imc) exhibited strong labelling. In the cerebellum strong selective labelling for alpha 1 and beta receptors was seen in the molecular layer. Labelling of the granule cell layer was almost equally strong for alpha 1 but significantly less for beta binding sites. No significant labelling could be detected for alpha 2 binding sites.", 
    "6": "A simple, sensitive, and highly reliable liquid chromatographic method using fluorescence detection is described for the simultaneous determination of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in plasma and urine. This method involves a single extraction of the compounds with the internal standard pindolol from alkalinized plasma or urine into dichloromethane. A reconstituted aliquot with a mobile phase is injected onto a reversed-phase, Zorbax ODS column, and the detection is achieved by the excitation and emission wavelengths at 230 and 300 nm, respectively. The assay is reproducible and precise for metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in both plasma and urine samples, as judged by a coefficient of variation of less than 9.2% at all concentrations examined. The standard curves for metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol are linear over 10-200 ng/ml in plasma and over 0.5-10 micrograms/ml in urine. The lower detection limit is 2 ng/ml for each of the compounds in plasma using a 0.5-ml sample. Preliminary data on the oxidation polymorphism of metoprolol in Japanese subjects are reported using the current assay method. In 183 Japanese subjects no poor metabolizer of metoprolol has been identified so far.", 
    "7": "Chronic coadministration of oral verapamil with oral atenolol resulted in a variable increase in atenolol steady-state plasma concentrations in a group of 10 patients on chronic maintenance therapy. Individual subjects showed changes in area under the plasma atenolol concentration-time curve (AUC) of more than 100%, however group comparisons did not achieve statistical significance unless normalized for verapamil dose. Renal clearance of atenolol was shown to be decreased by more than 25% in 2 subjects studied using intravenous dosing of atenolol. This interaction is likely to contribute to the documented clinical intolerance of combinations of atenolol and verapamil.", 
    "8": "The influence of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on the concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in serum and dialysate and on the serum binding of oxprenolol, propranolol and phenytoin has been studied. Before starting CAPD treatment, the serum binding of oxprenolol and propranolol was higher and that of phenytoin lower than in healthy volunteers, and the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration was higher. During the first days to weeks after starting CAPD, the serum alpha 1-AGP concentration rose with a concomitant increase in the binding of oxprenolol and propranolol. Subsequently, the alpha 1-AGP level and the binding of oxprenolol and propranolol decreased to the values found before starting CAPD. The binding of phenytoin showed little change. The concentration of alpha 1-AGP in dialysate was 2 to 5% of that in serum.", 
    "9": "Sixteen healthy young volunteers were studied with echocardiography and systolic time intervals at rest and after three minutes' isometric exercise before and during autonomic blockade with atropine and propranolol. Isometric exercise increased cardiac output by raising the heart rate from 64 +/- 3 to 72 +/- 4 bpm (SEM) (p less than 0.01). Mean blood pressure increased from 86 +/- 2 to 104 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.001) without any changes in the calculated total peripheral vascular resistance. Afterload (left ventricular systolic wall stress) rose but preload (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, LVEDD) did not change. There was no variation in fractional shortening, maximal velocity of circumfertial fibre shortening (VCFmax) or pre-ejection period (PEP) despite increased afterload. This indicates stimulated intropy during isometric exercise. Autonomic blockade enhanced cardiac output by increasing heart rate from 64 +/- 3 to 97 +/- 2 bpm (p less than 0.001). Mean blood pressure rose from 86 +/- 2 to 93 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.01) while vascular resistance fell. Afterload did not change but LVEDD shortened form 45.5 +/- 0.9 to 43.5 +/- 0.9 mm (p less than 0.001). Preload-independent VCFmax did not increase despite raised heart rate. PEP rose from 99 +/- 4 to 107 +/- 3 ms (p less than 0.01) and fractional shortening fell from 29 +/- 1 to 25 +/- 1% (p less than 0.001); these changes were greater than expected from the reduced preload. Consequently autonomic blockade seems to impair myocardial contractility despite vagal dominance at rest. Heart rate and cardiac output were not influenced by isometric exercise during autonomic blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Vasopressin and angiotensin II markedly stimulated oxygen uptake in the perfused rat hindlimb. The increase due to each agent approached 70% of the basal rate, and was greater than that produced by a maximal concentration of norepinephrine. Half-maximal stimulation occurred at 60 pM vasopressin, 0.5 nM angiotensin II and 10 nM norepinephrine. Angiotensins I and III were less potent than angiotensin II. For each agent, the dose-dependent increase in oxygen uptake coincided with a dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure. The effects of both vasopressin and angiotensin to increase oxygen uptake and pressure were not inhibited by either phentolamine, propranolol or a combination of the two, but were completely inhibited by the vasodilator, nitroprusside. Nitroprusside also inhibited flow-induced increases in hindlimb oxygen uptake and perfusion pressure. The findings indicate a key role for the vascular system in the control of hindlimb oxygen uptake.", 
    "11": "The case of a 58 year old woman who died after ingestion of 14.4 g of sotalol and 50 mg of triazolam is described. Despite medical treatment, intracardiac pacing and hemodialysis, cardiovascular failure persisted and became irreversible. High sotalol concentrations were observed in plasma (65 micrograms/ml) and in post mortem tissues samples. Tissue to plasma ratios ranged from 2.5 to 6. The high drug concentration found in heart tissue (104.4 micrograms/g) explains the difficulties experienced in the sotalol poisoning.", 
    "12": "In association experiments of (-)125Iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) with human mononuclear cells (MNC) at 70 pM and a temperature of 37 degrees C equilibrium was reached within 30 min. However, when the same experiments were performed at a concentration of 4 pM 125ICYP, equilibrium was only reached after 3 hours. The consequences of incomplete equilibrium for the interpretation of binding experiments under the incorrect assumption that equilibrium has been reached, was investigated at equilibration times of one, two and three hours. The dissociation constant, Kd, decreased from 7.4 +/- 0.2 pM after one hour to 2.5 +/- 0.4 pM after three hours of incubation while the receptor density, RO, decreased from 970 +/- 170 to 713 +/- 58 sites/cell. Analysis of computer simulated binding curves confirmed the decrease in Kd and RO at prolonged incubations. We conclude that in 125ICYP binding in intact MNC one hour of incubation is not sufficient to obtain equilibrium at the lower concentrations. This leads to an overestimation of Kd- and to a lesser extent of RO-values. Extending the incubation time to three hours on the other hand may lead to a loss of cells and therefore to an underestimation of RO.", 
    "13": "Known synergism between forskolin and hormones in adenylate cyclase activation leads to the supposition that hormone might stimulate forskolin binding. That possibility was tested using intact wild type S49 cultured lymphoma cells. Using 40 nM [3H]-forskolin it was shown that the extent of forskolin binding using a filtration technique increased with the concentration of epinephrine or isoproterenol (INE). Moreover, the hormone-dependent forskolin binding was stereospecific (requiring l- rather than d-epinephrine), it was not observed in the cyc- variant and it was not inhibited by cytochalasin B. These observations lead to the conclusion that the binding is specifically associated with the adenylate cyclase system and requires a functional Gs unit. Epinephrine-stimulated forskolin binding did not correlate exactly with forskolin activation of adenylate cyclase in the presence of similar concentrations of epinephrine. It was concluded from that observation that there is not a one to one correspondence between binding and activation.", 
    "14": "We have studied the plasma concentrations levels of metoprolol after its twice daily administration in a dose of 50 mg for 4 days in ten, hypertensive pregnant women to the during monotherapy and in combination with 25 mg of hydralazine given twice daily. Hydralazine increased the median AUC and Cmax of metoprolol by 38% and 88% respectively, and decreased the tmax from 1.5 h to 1.0 h. Hydralazine had no effect on the plasma concentrations of alpha-OH-metoprolol. These results suggest that the effect of hydralazine on metoprolol plasma concentrations is primarily due to a reduction in first-pass elimination.", 
    "15": "Epinephrine (1, 3 and 10 micrograms/kg) was found to increase retinal and choroidal blood flow (22, 49 and 67%) when it was administered intravenously. The increase in retinal and choroidal blood flow coincided well with the increase in systemic blood pressure (44, 65 and 96%, respectively). When epinephrine (2%) was instilled to the eyes topically the retinal and choroidal blood flow decreased (15%) while systemic blood pressure remained unchanged. It is suggested that the decrease in retinal and choroidal blood flow by topical epinephrine could be the cause of epinephrine maculopathy reported previously. L-Timolol (0.25%, topically) did not affect retinal and choroidal blood flow significantly.", 
    "16": "To establish whether long-term application of nicotine can at all alter thrombocyte function, the alkaloid was administered to rats and guinea pigs for up to 8 weeks, using subcutaneously implanted ALZET minipumps. These two species were examined, since rat platelets are known to possess both alpha 2- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas guinea pig platelets have practically none of either type. Platelet activity was assessed ex vivo by determining rates of ADP-induced aggregation and by applying a new in vitro technique giving a measure of primary hemostasis. Nicotine in doses of 2 mg/kg/day (rats) and 10 mg/kg/day (guinea pigs), continuously applied over 8 weeks, yielded alkaloid plasma levels in the respective species in the same range as found for smokers. This chronic in vivo pretreatment had no discernible effect on platelet function. However, platelets from rats having received the higher dose of 10 mg nicotine/kg/day for 8 weeks required a significantly higher concentration of ADP to induce the half-maximal rate of aggregation. Concomitantly, the in vitro determined bleeding time doubled. The nicotine-induced decrease in platelet sensitivity towards ADP could be prevented by simultaneously treating the rats with the beta-blocker propranolol. Adrenaline applied chronically to rats for 8 weeks stimulated platelet response instead of mimicking nicotine effects. The unexpected inhibition of rat platelet function at higher alkaloid-dosage thus seems to be an indirect nicotine action, mediated via platelet beta-adrenoceptors. Since chronic treatment with adrenaline did not exert such an effect, the action of nicotine may, rather, be attributed to increases in endogenous noradrenaline. These results could explain varying responses of human blood platelets in smokers.", 
    "17": "The effects of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) inhibitors with epinephrine on intraocular pressure in the pigmented rabbit were studied. MAO-A inhibitors were used topically with or without various concentrations of epinephrine. For the measurement of intraocular pressure, applanation pneumatonography was used and tissue MAO activities were determined by radiometric assay. After topical administration with clorgyline, MAO-A activities in the bulbar conjunctiva and the iris-ciliary body were remarkably inhibited, whereas MAO-B inhibition was minimal. Maximal reduction of intraocular pressure with 0.05% epinephrine was 3.2 mmHg. Single administration of clorgyline, amiflamine, moclobemide or CGP 11305-A caused decreases in the intraocular pressure of 2.0, 2.5, 1.8 and 2.4 mmHg, respectively. In the coadministration experiments with epinephrine, the ocular hypotensive effects of epinephrine were potentiated with clorgyline, amiflamine, moclobemide and CGP 11305-A (6.6, 4.8, 5.6 and 5.8 mmHg). On the contrary, they were not influenced by the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl. These results indicated that MAO-A inhibitors potentiated the ocular hypotensive effects of epinephrine, and that the coadministration of a reversible MAO-A inhibitor with epinephrine might be useful for patients with glaucoma.", 
    "18": "In the course of a 16 weeks' interval treatment of migraine in connection with two multicenter double-blind studies, flunarizine was compared with propranolol in patients suffering predominantly from \"classical migraine\". Eighty-seven patients from 12 outpatient departments were admitted to the first study, while 434 patients from 99 medical practices participated in the second study. After each month of treatment, the patients were clinically evaluated, and the number, duration, and severity of attacks were documented. Concerning the frequency and intensity of attacks, additional analgesics consumption and overall evaluation, both drugs proved to be highly effective in the practice as well as in the hospital study. The percentage and severity of side-effects were comparable in the two treatment groups. Summarizing, it may be stated that the studies proved the efficacy of flunarizine to be rather similar to that of propranolol in the prophylactic treatment of migraine.", 
    "19": "Four studies were pooled to study the onset of action of three pharmacologically different migraine prophylactics: flunarizine, pizotifen and propranolol. Inter-drug differences in reduction of baseline attack frequency were subjected to analysis of variance. At months 1, 2, and 3 the inter-drug differences in number of patients showing a first 50% decrease in attack rate were subjected to the Chi-square test. Both tests showed that there were no significant differences in onset of action between the three drugs. It is concluded that migraine responds to flunarizine and to other commonly used prophylactics in a similar way and with similar kinetics.", 
    "20": "The interplay of corneal epithelial integrity and prodrug lipophilicity in the corneal penetration of a homologous series of timolol prodrugs was studied. A reversed phase HPLC procedure was used to assay for timolol and its prodrugs. The optimal distribution coefficient for corneal penetration on a logarithmic basis was found to be 2.5, and for two prodrugs of equal lipophilicity the enzymatically labile one was better absorbed. The corneal permeability coefficient of O-acetyl, propionyl, and butyryl timolol was unaffected by deepithelizing the cornea, whereas that of the other prodrugs was reduced. This suggests that these three prodrugs diffused across the corneal epithelium proper as readily as across its basement membrane, which was not removed by the deepithelizing procedure. In contrast to the in vitro results, deepithelizing the cornea did not affect the aqueous humor concentration of timolol at 20 min afforded by any of the prodrugs except the O-propionyl and octanoyl esters. This suggests that factors other than corneal penetration exerted a more important role in affecting the aqueous humor drug concentration when the cornea was deepithelized.", 
    "21": "The binding characteristics of 3H-timolol to bovine iris melanin were determined by using a ligand binding assay. The association and dissociation kinetics were performed using 100 nM 3H-timolol and 0.5 mg/ml melanin at 37 degrees C. The effects of pH, ethanol, 2.5 microM isoxuprine and 1 microM d- and 1-propranolol on 100 nM 3H-timolol binding were also determined. In saturation experiments 3H-timolol (from 1.25 nM to 5 microM) was equilibrated with 0.5 mg/ml melanin. The binding was saturable with the binding maximum of about 1 microM timolol/g melanin. The binding of 100 nM 3H-timolol to melanin increased up to 5 hours and amounted 24% of the added radioactivity. The best fit of the association constants was obtained by using a two fit model. The association rate constants were 4.92 x 10(5) M-1 min-1 and 5.95 x 10(6) M-1 min-1. The dissociation was rapid in vitro and uniphasic with a dissociation rate constant of 5.08 x 10(-3) min-1. The pH, ethanol and both enantiomers of propranolol did not appreciably alter the timolol binding, while isoxuprine diminished it.", 
    "22": "The effects of two oxprenolol oral osmotic (OROS) delivery systems on heart rate and blood pressure before and during recovery from exercise at a predetermined load were examined in twelve patients with hypertension previously responding to beta-blocker monotherapy. Haemodynamic responses were attenuated during the 24 h after single and repeated (15 days') once daily administrations of 10/170 and 16/260 oxprenolol OROS. At 24 h after repeated doses, compared to placebo there were significant reductions in resting blood pressure and in heart rate immediately following exercise. Attenuation of heart rate after exercise was dose related but differences between the systems with respect to resting heart rate and blood pressure were inconsistent. Antihypertensive responses after repeated doses were greater than those after single doses. However, reductions in resting and exercise heart rates were consistently less on chronic therapy. This may reflect enhanced expression of the partial agonist activity of oxprenolol due to altered receptor sensitivity after prolonged beta-blockade. The plasma oxprenolol profiles after both systems indicated slow absorption and substantial concentrations were apparent 24 h after drug administration. These observations suggest that both oxprenolol OROS systems display sustained drug release and on once daily dosing provide 24 h beta-blockade and control of blood pressure at rest and following exercise.", 
    "23": "To assess the partial agonist activity of cicloprolol in man, four studies were carried out in normal male volunteers. I and II. Open dose escalating studies of the effects of oral doses of the drug on exercise tachycardia and sleeping heart rate. III and IV. Double-blind randomized studies of the effects of placebo, cicloprolol 25 mg, cicloprolol 50 mg, cicloprolol 100 mg, atenolol 50 mg, pindolol 10 mg, salbutamol 8 mg and prenalterol 50 mg on sleeping heart rate, resting supine heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow, finger tremor and exercise tachycardia. All doses of cicloprolol above 2.5 mg reduced an exercise tachycardia but there was no increase in effect above a dose of 50 mg. Cicloprolol caused a dose dependent increase in sleeping heart rate up to 200 mg. Cicloprolol increased resting supine heart rate, systolic blood pressure, forearm blood flow and finger tremor. None of the drugs affected quality of sleep. Cicloprolol has significant partial agonist activity at the beta 1-adrenoceptor as indicated by increases in heart rate and systolic blood pressure. The increases in finger tremor and forearm blood flow suggest that cicloprolol has some partial agonist activity at the beta 2-adrenoceptor.", 
    "24": "In 1,395 patients admitted to hospital between 1976 and 1981 due to suspected acute myocardial infarction, the 5-year mortality rate was related to whether they developed infarction or not during the first 3 days. In all, patients with definite myocardial infarction had a 5-year mortality rate of 33.4% as compared with 13.3% in patients not fulfilling the criteria for this diagnosis (p less than 0.001). When separately analyzing patients with no previous myocardial infarction before admission and discharged from hospital, the corresponding mortality rate was 24.1% for myocardial infarction patients versus 8.1% in nonmyocardial infarction patients (p less than 0.001). Among all patients with nonconfirmed myocardial infarction, those who partly fulfilled the criteria (possible myocardial infarction) had a 5-year mortality rate of 16.7% as compared with 12.0% in those in whom myocardial infarction was completely ruled out (p = 0.18). Independent risk factors for death among patients not developing early infarction were high age and a clinical history of previous myocardial infarction and smoking. We conclude that in this study the long-term prognosis among patients admitted to hospital due to suspected acute myocardial infarction was clearly related to whether they developed an infarction or not during the first 3 days in hospital.", 
    "25": "Continuous sympathetic stimulation at 8-10 Hz caused intense vasoconstriction in the gland, so stimulation was generally given in an interrupted pattern to minimize this detrimental effect on secretion. Only a small increase in fluid secretion occurred; it became thick and tended to block the cannula; therefore in later experiments the main duct was not cannulated. After sympathetic stimulation there was substantial degranulation of acinar cells. However, as this was accompanied by little movement of water, the secreted mucosubstance distended the ductal lumina. The granular tubule cells were unchanged by sympathetic stimulation. Use of selective blocking agents revealed that the sympathetically-evoked secretion of acinar mucin was mediated mainly via beta-adrenoreceptor activation. As stimulation of the sympathetic nerves alone caused little additional formation of fluid, the effects of superimposing continuous low frequency sympathetic stimulation onto a background of low parasympathetic secretion were compared with similar parasympathetic stimulation alone of the contralateral gland. These double nerve stimulations did not augment the volume of fluid secreted, or cause morphological changes additional to those from parasympathetic stimulation alone. Nevertheless, it is likely that, under natural reflex conditions, sympathetic impulses can increase the amount of acinar mucosubstance secreted.", 
    "26": "The effects of plasma lipids, blood glucose, and serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, 6-month period were studied in 18 patients with essential hypertension. There were no significant changes in the concentration of serum total cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides during treatment periods with pindolol or atenolol, although there was a tendency to higher triglyceride levels during atenolol treatment. The serum HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower after 6 months of therapy with atenolol than before treatment, but HDL-cholesterol levels increased slightly during pindolol treatment. The ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol decreased significantly during 6 months of treatment with atenolol. Fasting blood glucose concentrations did not change significantly during 6 months of treatment with pindolol or atenolol, but during oral glucose tolerance test, blood glucose values at 60 min were raised after pindolol therapy. Serum insulin levels during oral glucose tolerance test at 120 min were decreased after pindolol therapy, but no significant changes were found in C-peptide levels during treatment periods.", 
    "27": "An analysis of 41 trials of angina of all varieties confirms that calcium antagonists are an important advance and are now established therapy for these syndromes. In effort angina, verapamil in a dose of 360-480 mg daily is better than propranolol in standard doses. Although nifedipine is highly effective against vasospastic angina, its use in threatened myocardial infarction or severe unstable angina is not supported by recent studies, unless combined with a beta-blocker. Diltiazem has recently been tested with apparent benefit in non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. Otherwise, these calcium antagonist agents all seem to have approximate equipotency in clinical ischemic syndromes including effort and vasospastic angina. Subjective side effects seem most troublesome in the case of nifedipine. All three calcium antagonists, especially nifedipine, have been successfully combined with beta-blocker therapy, yet occasional additive negative inotropic or chronotropic or dromotropic interactions may occur when verapamil or diltiazem is added to beta-blockade, and occasionally the direct negative inotropic potential of nifedipine may become evident. The choice between the calcium antagonists is determined not only by the clinical picture but also by the anticipated side effects in a given patient and by the overall cardiovascular status. In patients with supraventricular tachycardias or sinus tachycardia, verapamil or diltiazem is preferred, whereas in patients with a resting bradycardia or borderline heart failure nifedipine is likely to be chosen.", 
    "28": "The acute administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (80 mg) and atenolol (50 mg) on baroreflex function were investigated in healthy volunteers. Two h after administration both propranolol and atenolol significantly prolonged the supine R-R interval (1126, 1128 ms respectively) compared to placebo (1012 ms); systolic arterial pressure also fell (102.9, 102.0 mm Hg respectively) compared to placebo (112.6 mm Hg). Baroreflex function, assessed using glyceryl trinitrate to deactivate the baroreceptors was unchanged by these drugs compared to placebo. Baroreflex sensitivity (slope of the linear regression line relating R-R interval to systolic blood pressure) using phenylephrine to activate the baroreceptors, was also unchanged (17.2, 17.9 ms/mm Hg respectively) compared to placebo (19.9 ms/mm Hg). However both regression lines were shifted (p less than 0.05) to the left compared to placebo.", 
    "29": "To quantitatively examine and compare the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on ventilation, we studied 20 healthy volunteers during inhalation of room air and at steady state CO2 (2.0, 4.4, 6.0%) following a single oral dose of bupranolol (vs. placebo). During room air breathing, minute ventilation (VE) and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) were significantly reduced after beta-blockade with a concomitant increase in blood PaCO2 (p less than 0.01). The timing factor TI/Ttot and mouth occlusion pressure P0.1 remained unchanged. These differences were, as shown from calculated effective alveolar ventilation, mainly attributed to a decrease in physiological dead space ventilation following beta-blockade. With a stepwise increase in FICO2, the difference in PaCO2 between placebo and bupranolol tended to approach zero, whereas VE and VT/TI remained significantly lower during beta-blockade (P less than 0.05). In contrast, no difference existed in P0.1 between bupranolol and placebo. We suggest that (1) respiratory drive assessed by P0.1 is unaffected by beta-blockade and (2) mean inspiratory flow depends also on CO2 elimination characteristics, which are influenced by beta-blockade.", 
    "30": "The present study examined the effects of early postnatal treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg IP daily) on concomitant and subsequent behavior and central aminergic transmission in rats. During propranolol exposure from the 7th to the 20th postnatal days sleep-wake recordings, carried out with the static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) method, showed a decrease in the percentage of active sleep and an increase in waking. When the animals were 1-3 months of age, the open field behavior was changed, immobility time in the Porsolt's swim test was lengthened, and voluntary alcohol consumption was increased in the propranolol-treated rats. Neither motor reactivity to auditory stimuli nor spontaneous alternation behavior was affected. At the age of 4 months concentrations of brain amines and their metabolites were measured from several brain regions. In the propranolol-treated rats the noradrenaline levels were increased in the limbic forebrain and cerebellum. The results suggest that in rats the exposure to propranolol during the rapid growth period of cerebral catecholamine systems, and the concomitant alterations in sleep are related to later changes in behavior and to increased noradrenaline content in the limbic forebrain and cerebellum.", 
    "31": "Weekly injections of the catecholamine depleting agent 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) were used to denervate rabbit hearts chemically. Analyses of morphology and beta-adrenergic receptor density were made at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Changes resulting from subacute and chronic inflammatory processes were evident by light microscopy after 1 week. At that time, electron microscopy revealed marked increases in collagen, large myocytic vacuolizations in myocytes, widened gap junctions, and myofibrillar degeneration and dropout. Receptor density was marginally increased at 2 weeks but was decreased (p less than .05) at 4 weeks (maximal [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding in fmol/mg: 69.6 +/- 5.4 in controls vs 49.2 +/- 5.1 in 6-OHDA-treated animals). Basal, isoproterenol-stimulated and F- -stimulated adenylate cyclase activities were decreased in the 6-OHDA-treated group at 4 weeks. We conclude that administration of 6-OHDA may cause severe myocardial damage, and that this process may involve loss of some functional components of the cell membrane.", 
    "32": "Literary data proved evidence that uterine actions of estrogens develop through different receptor systems. We performed experiments to examine whether different mechanisms are also involved in the hepatic effects of estrogenic steroids. Female rats were treated with a single dose of 5 mg/kg estrone. Dry liver weight and protein content increased. Both responses were blocked by prior administration of natural antiestrogen progesterone. Increased wet organ weight and water content were measured as edematous reactions. They can be attributed to the depolymerisation of mucopolysaccharides. Progesterone could not prevent these effects. Estrone induced glycogen synthesis in the liver. This was counteracted by progesterone treatment. To elucidate the possible role of the adenylcyclase system the animals were treated with beta-receptor blocker propranolol which had no effect either on liver glycogen content or on estrone induced synthesis. Dihydroergocryptine, an equal blocker of alpha 1- and alpha 2-receptors, did not interfere with glycogenetic action of estrone either. The selective alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin decreased the liver glycogen content and inhibited glycogenetic response to estrone. Our results proved that estrogens display their hepatic effects by several mechanisms that can be selectively blocked or moderated.", 
    "33": "Plasma membranes isolated from ram spermatozoa contain calmodulin, which represents approximately 0.03% of the total sperm calmodulin and 0.025% of the membrane protein. When membranes were isolated in the presence of ethylene glycol (beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), the amount of calmodulin associated with the plasma membranes was reduced by only 20%. The ATP-dependent calcium transport activity of the isolated plasma membranes is not enhanced by adding calmodulin and not inhibited by the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazinc (TFP), compound 48/80, or calmidazolium. In fact, there is an enhancement of calcium uptake by the calmodulin antagonists and this enhancement can be blocked by the Ca2+-channel blocker D-600. It is suggested that the ATP-dependent calcium transport activity in the plasma membrane of ram spermatozoa is not regulated by calmodulin.", 
    "34": "In 265 patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) for whom the 72-hour CK MB curve was obtained, three types of a curve were found: with a single and early 16 h peak value (type A), with a single late 16 h peak value (type B), and with a double peak (type C). Type A of the CK MB curve was found in 32% of patients with acute MI, type B in 55% and type C in 13%. There were no significant differences of CK MB max between the type groups. Infarct size differed significantly between groups (A-29 +/- 19, B-35 +/- 22, C-53 +/- 30 g Eq CK MB). In-hospital mortality also differed significantly particularly between type C (31%) and type A groups (5%). Nitroglycerin or practolol given intravenously during the first 48 hours changed the CK MB curve mainly by decreasing CK MB max as compared to controls treated conventionally. There was no effect of treatment with either nitroglycerin or practolol on the clinical course in patients with type A CK MB curve. There is a good correlation between the CK MB curve type and the clinical course of MI. Nitroglycerin or practolol decreased the infarct size only in patients with either B or C type of CK MB curve, having no influence in patients with a mild form of acute MI (type A).", 
    "35": "First, the pharmacokinetics of antipyrine were studied in 12 healthy male and female volunteers (i) before misoprostol, (ii) after they had received misoprostol 400 micrograms twice daily for 28 days and (iii) after a further 28 days during which no misoprostol was taken. The plasma half-life and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of antipyrine were unchanged. The findings suggest that misoprostol is not an hepatic enzyme inducer. Second, 12 healthy male and female volunteers took propranolol 80 mg twice daily for four weeks; during the second and third of these weeks the volunteers also took misoprostol 400 micrograms twice daily. The plasma concentrations of propranolol under these steady state dosing conditions increased when misoprostol was added to propranolol. The mechanism underlying this finding should be clarified.", 
    "36": "Ninety-five patients undergoing microsurgery of the middle ear were anaesthetised using thiopentone, nitrous oxide, oxygen and halothane via a low flow circle system, with carbon-dioxide absorption. Systolic blood pressure was reduced to approximately 65 mmHg either by the use of increments of labetalol, or by an infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). The degree of haemostasis achieved was assessed by the surgeon who was unaware which hypotensive agent was being used. Both hypotensive agents produced good conditions in all patients. Thus GTN is a suitable agent to induce hypotension for this type of microsurgery.", 
    "37": "Atenolol and nifedipine have been shown to be effective single agents in angina pectoris, but reports suggest that additional benefits may be conferred by combining the 2 drugs. Therefore, to establish that the combination regimen was at least as effective as either atenolol or nifedipine alone, a multicentre study was performed to compare the treatment regimens in 94 patients with characteristic chest pain compatible with a diagnosis of stable angina pectoris which was provoked by effort and relieved by glyceryl trinitrate. After 4 weeks on atenolol 50 mg twice daily, the patients were randomised to receive, in a double-blind crossover fashion, atenolol 50 mg twice daily either with or without sustained release nifedipine 20 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. Compared with entry, all treatments apparently reduced the number of anginal attacks per week and the number of glyceryl trinitrate tablets taken. It was notable that blood pressure in patients during the study was normal. Treatment with atenolol or the combination appeared to improve exercise tests measured by time to onset of pain, time to greater than or equal to 1mm ST segment depression and duration. The ST segment depression was substantially lower on the fixed combination compared with atenolol alone; ST segment depression during exercise was recorded in 82% of patients after atenolol and 75% after the combination, compared with 100% on entry. There was a substantial improvement in the number of patients rendered pain free: 29% on atenolol and 42% on combination. There was little difference between treatments in terms of adverse effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The acute haemodynamic effect of metoprolol was investigated in 14 patients with essential hypertension (7 of the WHO stage I, 7 of stage II). The evaluated parameters include the mean arterial blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), total peripheral resistance (TPR) and capillary blood flow of the forearm muscle (CBF). Investigation was carried out within two days: the 1st day at rest and after an infusion of 20% mannitol, the 2nd day with additional previous intravenous administration of 5 mg of metoprolol. The findings were as follows: 1. There was a decrease of MBP, a slowdown of HR and a decrease of CBF after metoprolol both in hypertensives I and II. 2. The different haemodynamic response of the Ist and IInd stages of essential hypertension was manifested by a significant decrease of CI and an increase of TPR in hypertensives II (but not I) not only after the infusion of mannitol alone, but also after i.v. administration of metoprolol. The exaggerated haemodynamic response to acute metoprolol administration in essential hypertension II could be caused by latently impaired cardiac performance in this stage.", 
    "39": "The concentration of lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoprotein A-I and B was measured in the plasma of 33 patients, enrolled in a double-blind, controlled trial of alprenolol in myocardial infarction, after one year on the study medication and again after 6 months off the medication. Sixteen patients received 200 mg alprenolol twice daily and 17 received placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between the parameters in the two groups after one year on medication. However, when medication was stopped, the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I fell by 9% in the alprenolol group and increased by 2% in the placebo group. This difference was statistically significant. Our results suggest that alprenolol, a beta-blocker with weak intrinsic sympathomimetic effect, has slight effects on plasma lipoproteins. These effects were apparent only by measurements of apolipoproteins.", 
    "40": "Blood pressure (PA) and heart rate (HR) were measured in the conscious, resting toad, Bufo marinus. Treatment with bretylium (an adrenergic neurone blocking agent), alone or in combination with phentolamine and propranolol (adrenoceptor antagonists) did not alter PA or HR significantly. Atropine caused a small but significant increase in HR but had no effect on PA. The experiments indicate a cholinergic cardio-inhibitory tone but give no evidence for an adrenergic pressor tone at rest. Treadmill exercise caused a rapid increase in PA and HR which was sustained throughout the exercise period. This response was partly psychogenic. The concentration of plasma catecholamines increased during exercise and was high enough to affect organs that were included in an extracorporeal blood circuit with the exercising animal. Bretylium treatment revealed an initial hypotension, presumably due to work hyperaemia, followed by a hypertension which was reduced compared to controls. The tachycardia was delayed but HR eventually reached control levels. Additional treatment with phentolamine and propranolol did not further affect the PA response, but significantly reduced the tachycardia reached during exercise. It is concluded that the cardiovascular responses to exercise involve adrenergic nerve fibres causing hypertension and an initial rapid tachycardia. Circulating catecholamines seem to be the major cause of the sustained tachycardia.", 
    "41": "A fall in blood pH was induced by intra-arterial infusion of HCl in seawater-adapted rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). The acute acidosis resulting from HCl infusion caused a short-lived decrease in plasma bicarbonate concentration ([HCO3-]) and an increase in arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2). Erythrocyte pH and bicarbonate concentrations were not significantly altered by the infusion of acid. Injection of acid did, however, stimulate a branchial net H+ efflux which could be primarily accounted for by a net uptake of bicarbonate equivalent ions from the environmental water. Acid infusion of animals pre-treated with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, induced a similar pattern of change in plasma acid-base status. However, the recovery of plasma pH and restoration of plasma [HCO3-] were slower than in animals infused with acid alone. Red cell pH fell significantly in the face of plasma acidosis in the beta-blocked animals. Erythrocyte [HCO3-] showed a similar pattern of change to that of erythrocyte pH. Branchial net H+ efflux increased to a lesser extent following acid infusion in animals treated with propranolol. We conclude that catecholamines released into the bloodstream during periods of acute acidosis may play an important role in facilitating branchial H+ efflux in seawater-adapted rainbow trout.", 
    "42": "1. Phenacetin O-deethylation catalysed by human liver microcomes has been examined over a substrate concentration range of 2.5 to 700 microM using preparations of eight human liver samples. Michaelis-Menten kinetics described phenacetin oxidation satisfactorily in five of these samples; apparent Km values were in the range of 17.7 to 38.4 microM. 2. In the three other livers a single rectangular hyperbolic relationship did not describe the substrate saturation data adequately; analyses in these three cases requiring two classes of catalytic site. The apparent Km value for the higher affinity class of site in these three samples was within the range quoted above, but limitations imposed by assay sensitivity and phenacetin solubility obviated accurate characterization of the lower affinity class. 3. Estimates of Vmax for the high affinity class of site in the eight livers varied eleven-fold and there was no correlation between either Km or Vmax and microsomal cytochrome P-450 specific content, NADPH cytochrome c (P-450) reductase specific activity or ethylmorphine demethylase activity. 4. Propranolol was a potent competitive inhibitor of phenacetin deethylation with apparent Ki values of 2 to 7 microM describing its effect on the higher affinity class of activity. Propranolol was also an inhibitor of the lower affinity phenacetin deethylase identified in three of the livers, however the mechanism of inhibition could not be characterized. 5. These data suggest the possibility that propranolol oxidation may be mediated in part, by one or more human liver cytochrome P-450 species catalyzing phenacetin oxidation.", 
    "43": "In twenty-one anaesthetized open chest cats the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was occluded for three hours. Seven cats were pretreated with a bolus injection of Verapamil, followed by a continuous infusion of Verapamil during the ischaemic period. Seven cats were pretreated with a bolus injection of Timolol to a heart rate reduction of 20 beats/min or more and seven cats were given saline. In the latter two groups the cats received a continuous infusion of saline during the period of coronary occlusion. Biopsies were taken from the mid-myocardium of the normal, border and ischaemic zones, as defined by fluorescein staining, and verified by blood flow measurements with radiolabelled microspheres. Standard point counting techniques were used for calculations of fractional volumes of mitochondria, cytoplasm and myofibrils as well as of mitochondrial surface density and surface to volume ratio. We observed a cytoplasmic oedema in the border and ischaemic zones, that was not altered by medical treatment. In the border zone of the control cats there is greater mitochondrial swelling than in the ischaemic zone. This particular swelling is not seen in the treatment groups. However, in the normal and border zones of the verapamil group the mitochondria are smaller when compared with the respective zones in the two other groups, but increases relatively more in size in the border and ischaemic zones. Furthermore, we measured the water content, sarcomere length and per cent heavily damaged cells. These variables were not altered by Verapamil or Timolol in any zone when compared with the respective zones in the control group.", 
    "44": "Fifteen patients aged 55 +/- 6 years (mean +/- SD) with mild, chronic stable angina were evaluated after 2 weeks of sublingual nitroglycerin therapy (control) and also after 12 weeks of treatment with either propranolol, up to 320 mg per day, or nifedipine, up to 120 mg per day, in order to measure signs of ischemia and the response of symptoms to therapy. Compared with the control period, there was a decrease in average daily episodes of angina from 1.0 +/- 0.8 to 0.5 +/- 0.4 with treatment (p = 0.10). There was a significant decrease of greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment depression (both symptomatic and asymptomatic), from 6.1 +/- 6.5 to 1.5 +/- 2.4 episodes per 24 hours, p less than 0.001, and of asymptomatic episodes of ST segment depression, from 3.5 +/- 3.9 to 1.0 +/- 2.1 episodes per 24 hours, p = 0.03. The number of patients who had any episodes of greater than or equal to 1.0 mm ST segment depression on their 24-hour ECG decreased from 14 to 6 (93% to 40% of patients, p = 0.005) with treatment, and the number of patients with any episodes of ST segment depression without symptoms decreased from 11 to 5 (73% to 33% of patients, p = 0.07). There was an insignificant increase in treadmill time from 333 +/- 134 to 380 +/- 156 seconds, and an insignificant decrease in maximum double-product from 16,631 +/- 3,599 to 14,922 +/- 4,086; the number of patients with angina at maximum exercise decreased from 13 to 10 (87% to 67%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "The basal ganglia seem to be involved in the control of abnormal hippocampal activity. The caudate nucleus has been reported to elicit hippocampal theta rhythm and to inhibit epileptiform spikes. Experiments were conducted to test the action of caudate stimulation on focal penicillin epilepsy of the hippocampus in the cat prior to and after septal coagulation and parenteral atropine administration. Results showed that the caudate is able to reduce both hippocampal spike frequency and amplitude. The effects are abolished by septal lesions and either decreased or totally suppressed by atropine administration. The findings are discussed in terms of caudate influence on septum; the importance of cholinergic pathways is also emphasized.", 
    "46": "Eight patients with a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100mm Hg when treated with a diuretic and a beta-blocker participated in a randomised crossover study comparing the haemodynamic effects of adjunctive therapy with pinacidil or hydralazine. The vasodilator dose was increased until the diastolic blood pressure was less than 90mm Hg or the maximum dosage, hydralazine 100mg twice daily, or pinacidil 50mg twice daily, was reached. Treatment continued for 3 to 6 months and a haemodynamic study was performed. After washout, the patients received the alternative treatment. In the upright position, during supine rest and during isometric as well as dynamic exercise, pinacidil lowered blood pressure more effectively than hydralazine. No differences between the 2 treatments were found in heart rate, stroke index, cardiac index, end systolic wall stress or glomerular filtration rate. Pulmonary mean and wedge pressure were lower during treatment with pinacidil. Forearm blood flow was higher and forearm vascular resistance lower during treatment with pinacidil. Cardiac contractility, judged from the systolic time interval ratio PEP: LVET, was lower during treatment with pinacidil compared with hydralazine. The median daily dose of pinacidil was 50mg and that of hydralazine 200mg. It was also noted that during long term treatment, pinacidil seemed more effective in reducing blood pressure than hydralazine.", 
    "47": "This review summarises the results of major hypertension trials and addresses the major questions of whether stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) can be prevented or postponed by blood pressure-lowering drug treatment. Several studies from the 1970s to the 1980s have shown beyond doubt that treatment of high blood pressure decreases the incidence of stroke. Most trials have used thiazide diuretics as active treatment; in one trial the beta-blocker propranolol, compared with placebo, was shown to lower stroke incidence. For thiazide diuretics the preventive effect has been shown for severe, moderate and mild hypertension. The situation regarding CHD is unclear. Early trials with thiazide diuretics showed a lower CHD mortality compared with placebo but no effect on total incidence of CHD events. Three trials during the early 1980s comparing thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers were not able to show a differential effect of the 2 types of drugs. Recently, however, a trial using the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol reported a significantly lower CHD mortality and total mortality compared with thiazide diuretics. Further analyses are needed before the question of whether beta-blockers are superior to thiazide diuretics in preventing CHD can be finally answered.", 
    "48": "Diurnal variations of intraocular pressure are probably related to indolamines, prostaglandins, and the sensory nervous system. Because timolol maleate is able to block beta-1, beta-2, and dopaminergic receptors, as well as to act like an antagonist of serotonin, we evaluated its effect on diurnal variations of intraocular pressure. Eighty-eight intraocular pressure curves were established in 22 normal young volunteers. Intraocular pressures were measured in both eyes before and one week after the beginning of monolateral treatment with timolol 0.5% twice daily. The results showed a decrease in amplitude of diurnal variations of 24% (P = 0.07 in paired t-test) in timolol-treated eyes and no significant change in the contralateral eyes. The difference between both eyes was statistically significant in paired t-test (P = 0.01). Knowing the type of receptors on which timolol is susceptible to act, and furthermore, the type of neuro-transmitter which may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of diurnal variations of intraocular pressure, we suggest that timolol could reduce the amplitude of these variations by means of interactions with indolamines.", 
    "49": "The antihypertensive and hemodynamic efficacy of Betaloc (Egys-Hungary) was studied in 30 hypertensive patients in the II stage of the disease. The drug was applied in a single daily dose of 100 mg in the course of 6 months. The systolic and diastolic pressure and the heart rate decreased reliably (p less than 0.0001) at the end of the first month. The stroke volume increased (p less than 0.045) at the end of the sixth month but the minute volume and the cardiac index did not change (p greater than 0.32). The peripheral vascular resistance dicreased reliably (p less than 0.02) at the end of the sixth month--the degree depending on the initial type of circulation--and it determined the longstanding antihypertensive efficacy of Betaloc. No untoward reactions were registered.", 
    "50": "To assess the anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic activity of the beta-blocker atenolol (ATN) and the calcium antagonist nifedipine (NIFE) and their combination in coronary patients, a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study was performed. Ten male patients (mean age: 58 +/- 2.9 years) suffering from a stable effort angina were studied. The study lasted 14 weeks: after 2 weeks of wash-out, patients were randomly assigned to ATN (100 mg/day) and placebo-NIFE, or placebo-ATN and NIFE (10 mg three times/day), or ATN (100 mg) plus NIFE (10 mg three times/day) for 4 weeks. Maximal symptom-limited stress tests on a bicycle (10 watt/min) during the wash-out period (on days 10 and 14) and at the end of each treatment period were performed. All treatments significantly increased the work load at 1 mm ST depression, the angina threshold and the total work, and reduced ST depression at the maximal common work and at the maximal work. Also the atenolol-nifedipine combination significantly reduced ST depression at maximal common work and maximal work as compared to ATN and NIFE alone. In conclusion, this study confirms the anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal activity of both atenolol and nifedipine in stable effort angina and shows that their combination is able to increase anti-ischaemic activity.", 
    "51": "Twenty-one patients with mild or moderate hypertension were randomised to receive either Atenolol 100 mg (N = 10) or Pindolol 15 mg (N = 11) in a once daily dosage over a two month period. The effects of these two betablockers on the blood pressure and plasma lipid profile were studied. Special attention was paid to the methodology: obese patients (30% over theoretical weight derived from the Lorenz formula) and those with pre-treatment triglyceride levels higher than 1.82 mmol/l were excluded because of the well documented biological instability of such patients. The selected patients were given placebo for two weeks. At the end of the placebo period those subjects whose body weight, total cholesterol, apolipoproteins or triglycerides had varied by more than 10%, 15% and 30% respectively, were also excluded from the study. At the end of the 60 days active treatment period, a comparable fall in the blood pressure was observed in both groups and there was no significant difference in the biological parameters as compared with pre-treatment values. In addition, the cardiovascular risk, evaluated by the B/A1 apolipoprotein ratio, increased in only one patient in the group receiving Atenolol and one patient receiving Pindolol.", 
    "52": "Two different mechanisms for long-term vasoconstriction that sustain diastolic hypertension in the experimental and clinical forms of primary aldosteronism and renovascular hypertension can also be identified and quantified among patients with essential hypertension. The first is renin-independent, requires antecedent sodium retention, and appears related to abnormal membrane transport of calcium. This vasoconstriction is identified by low plasma renin and ionized calcium values and is correctable by sodium depletion or calcium channel or alpha-blockade. The second is renin-mediated but also involves an increase in cytosolic calcium. This mechanism is quantifiable by the plasma renin level and by the hypotensive response to an anti-renin-system drug (CEI inhibitor, saralasin, beta-blocker). At the very extremes of the range of plasma renin values encountered in hypertensive patients, one of the two mechanisms predominates, whereas in the medium range of renin values either or both mechanisms can be operative.", 
    "53": "In both acute and long term clinical studies, the antihypertensive effects of the S2-serotonergic receptor antagonist ketanserin are more marked in the elderly than in younger patients. The acute effect of ketanserin 10mg intravenously was studied in 57 patients between 25 and 90 years and a significant negative correlation was shown between age and the decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In longer term studies ketanserin has been compared with metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide in patients below and above 60 years. Both ketanserin and the diuretic showed greater antihypertensive efficacy in the elderly, whereas the beta-blocker did not. Data from 15 double-blind studies from the ketanserin International Data File confirm the relationship between age and antihypertensive efficacy. With respect to adverse effects of ketanserin, dizziness, somnolence and dryness of the mouth were commoner in younger than older patients. These effects were not the result of smaller dose requirements in the elderly, and there was no obvious pharmacokinetic reason (e.g. alteration in drug clearance) for the difference. Two theoretical possibilities for the differential age effect of ketanserin are advanced. First the smaller effect in the young may be due to activation of homeostatic mechanisms limiting its antihypertensive activity, or second, some selective (undefined) effect operative in the elderly may be responsible. It is known from animal studies that serotonin shows increased vasoconstrictor properties in the presence of extensive atheroma. Antagonism of this effect may account for the greater vasodilator and antihypertensive effect of ketanserin in elderly patients. This, however, is speculative and does not take into account the complex antihypertensive action of ketanserin. The role of serotonin in cardiovascular control is complex. Its effects depend on the species studied, the vascular bed being investigated, the dose used and the experimental conditions employed. Serotonin has central cardiac and peripheral vascular actions relevant to cardiovascular control. In the peripheral vasculature it can produce vasodilatation or vasoconstriction by either direct or indirect mechanisms. If this complexity were not confusing enough, the nomenclature of the receptors on which serotonin acts is under intense current debate, and little uniformity exists as to the terminology to be used. The terms of this review will be very specific.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "54": "To clarify the antihypertensive effect, safety and clinical usefulness of ketanserin, a comparative double-blind study was carried out in 277 patients with essential hypertension using propranolol as a control drug. Ketanserin 10 to 30 mg twice daily and propranolol 20 to 40 mg 3 times daily were administered for 12 weeks. The results showed no difference in antihypertensive effect and clinical usefulness between the drugs. In the ketanserine group, plasma concentration of total cholesterol was decreased significantly, and the reduction in heart rate was less than in the propranolol group. These findings suggest that ketanserin may satisfactorily control blood pressure.",

Each treatment period was followed by administration of a placebo over an equal length of time. 2. Only acebutolol reduced heart rate measured in the supine position significantly at rest, whereas acebutolol and labetalol reduced it significantly after exercise on the treadmill. 3. Only acebutolol lowered humeral pressure at rest but not after exercise. Neither drug produced a change in blood pressure in the ankle or in the first toe at rest or after exercise. 4. Blood flow measured by plethysmography was increased by labetalol in the calf by comparison with placebo and in the first toe by comparison with placebo and acebutolol. 5. Labetalol lowered peripheral resistance significantly in comparison with placebo in the calf and first toe. Acebutolol tended to lower the resistance insignificantly in the calf but to increase resistance in the first toe.", 
    "56": "In 1,395 patients in the age range 40-74 years participating in a double-blind trial with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction morbidity and quality of life were assessed during the first 5 years after randomization. During the first 3 months patients were given 200 mg metoprolol daily or placebo. Thereafter the two groups were treated similarly. Mortality during 5 years was 24.2% in patients originally randomized to metoprolol versus 25.7% in patients originally randomized to placebo (p greater than 0.2). No difference was observed regarding reinfarction rate, stroke or occurrence of bypass surgery during the 5-year follow-up. During the first 3 months 10% of patients in the metoprolol group were rehospitalized for various reasons versus 13% in the placebo group. The corresponding figures for 5 years were 59 and 60%, respectively. Among patients surviving 5 years 84% in both groups were on some medication of which beta-blockade was the dominating one. Symptoms of chest pain, dyspnea, claudicatio, smoking habits and working capacity did not differ and neither did quality of life according to the Nottingham Health Profile. We thus conclude that morbidity and quality of life were not significantly affected 5 years after early intervention with metoprolol in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "57": "Bronchial challenges with bronchoconstrictive drugs have supplied important information on some relevant pathophysiological aspects of bronchial asthma, i.e. nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Until now histamine and methacholine have been the most widely used inhalation tests. Recently, propranolol, given by inhalation, has been proposed and evaluated for possible application as a bronchial provocation challenge both in clinical and experimental setting. In asthmatic subjects with bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine and methacholine, inhaled propranolol induces a dose-related bronchoconstriction. In a group of 25 asthmatic patients, the mean value of provocative doses, in mumoles of propranolol that causes a 20% drop in FEV1 (PD20FEV1), is thirteen times greater than that of methacholine. In the same study, there is no correlation between the bronchial responses to the two drugs. Moreover, none of 9 normal subjects of the control group responds to inhaled propranolol. The mechanisms of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction are poorly understood. A cholinergic reflex is probably involved, but it is likely that propranolol has some different and rather peculiar pathways. Bronchial response to inhaled propranolol is a reliable, reproducible, safe, and well-tolerated method. Bronchoconstriction induced by propranolol appears to be a very promising technique in the investigation of the mechanisms of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness.",

An antianginal effect was observed in 68.5% of patients, an antihypertensive effect--in 71.3%, side-effects--in 6.4%.", 
    "59": "The efficacy, tolerance and effect on serum lipids of acebutolol were compared with those of atenolol over a 6-month period in a large group of patients with mild arterial hypertension. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing blood pressure, and tolerance was generally excellent. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations were reduced to a similar extent by both treatments at 2 months and this change was reflected in measurements of the total cholesterol concentrations. However, no significant changes occurred in serum triglyceride levels and at 6 months all serum lipid parameters had returned to baseline values. These observations suggest that cardioselective beta-blockers have no adverse effects on serum lipids at 6 months, after a temporary reduction of HDL-cholesterol at 2 months.", 
    "60": "Epidemiological and recent interventional studies have emphasised the relationship between plasma lipid parameters and the incidence of coronary heart disease. beta-Blockers, particularly those without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), are generally reported to increase triglyceride levels and decrease high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels, both changes theoretically increasing the risk of coronary heart disease. A review of all published trials concerning the effects of acebutolol (a cardioselective beta-blocker with mild ISA) on the plasma lipid profile was carried out, with a particular emphasis on studies reporting a comparison with other beta-blockers. The results indicate that, on average, acebutolol does not have any adverse effects on plasma lipids and may even reduce total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by 7 and 5%, respectively. In contrast, the other beta-blockers compared under the same conditions (propranolol, pindolol and penbutolol) tended to increase triglyceride levels (+19% when compared with acebutolol) and decrease HDL-cholesterol (-7% when compared with acebutolol) to an extent that was consistent with previous reports in the literature. In interpreting these differences in lipid parameters in the light of epidemiological and interventional study data, the use of acebutolol as opposed to the other beta-blockers could theoretically lead to a relative reduction in coronary risk of 20% or more.", 
    "61": "Improvement in the efficacy of newer antihypertensive agents has resulted in consideration of the side effects of drug therapy. Impairment of memory function resulting from antihypertensive therapy has been clinically suspected. This observation has been supported by a study in which the effects of methyldopa and propranolol on memory function were reported. Recently, memory function has been assessed in a group of patients treated with either a beta-blocker (atenolol) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) in a randomised, observer-blind study in moderate essential hypertension. The patients were assessed, on placebo and after 16 weeks of treatment on active therapy, by use of a series of 4 memory function tests related to everyday life. In the hypertension study group, 13 received atenolol and 12 received enalapril. Similar reduction of diastolic pressure occurred in both groups, but systolic pressure was significantly reduced in the enalapril group (p less than 0.05). In the atenolol group memory performance scores were consistently lower than in the placebo phase in 9 of 28 estimates of memory function. In the enalapril group there were no significant changes. The study indicated that atenolol might produce mild memory impairment, whereas enalapril was devoid of any measurable effect on memory function.", 
    "62": "The pathophysiological basis of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular arrhythmias in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively investigated in experimental as well as in some clinical studies. Numerous clinical studies have been performed with the aim to establish the feasibility of antifibrillatory prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death by pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs. Using class I-antiarrhythmic drugs the reported findings were contradictory. While the antiarrhythmic efficacy of Lidocaine and other, newer class I-antiarrhythmic drugs is well established, the antifibrillatory effects of these drugs in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction remain uncertain. In clinical studies with the endpoint of mortality in patients at risk, longterm administration of orally effective class I-antiarrhythmic drugs did not prove to be superior to placebo. However, beta-sympatholytic agents have been shown to reduce mortality in patients at risk in several large clinical studies. The basic mechanism seems to be primarily a reduction in sudden cardiac death which is caused predominantly by ventricular fibrillation. The antifibrillatory properties of beta-blockers was demonstrated as well by a reduction in the number of episodes of ventricular fibrillation. The recognition of patients at risk who profit most from chronic beta-blocker therapy remains the main problem when treatment of numerous low-risk patients is avoided. In the ISIS I-study with Atenolol intravenous administration of a beta-blocker in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction has been shown to be beneficial if hemodynamic monitoring, for example using flow-directed heart catherization is performed. In general this does not apply to the treatment with calciumantagonists, especially with Verapamil and Nifedipine. These drugs do not improve prognosis of acute myocardial ischemia, obviously because of hemodynamic side effects. The antifibrillatory efficacy of Verapamil-type calciumantagonists, shown in the experimental model, could not be demonstrated in the clinical setting. Nevertheless, further clinical studies performing longterm prophylactic treatment of patients at risk before the onset of myocardial ischemia seem to be worthwhile. Concerning class III-antiarrhythmic agents, clinical experience in the setting of acute myocardial infarction is limited; hence a final conclusion about their antifibrillatory efficacy under clinical conditions at present is impossible.", 
    "63": "Dihydrobunolol is an ocular metabolite equipotent to levobunolol. In order to understand the formation and distribution of dihydrobunolol after an ophthalmic dose of levobunolol, studies in vitro and in vivo were initiated. The metabolism of levobunolol to dihydrobunolol was investigated using an organ-culture technique. The corneal formation of dihydrobunolol was pH-dependent and increased as the pH of the incubation fluid increased from 5.3 to 8.3. Its formation from levobunolol was saturable with Vmax and Km values (pH 7.4) of 13.2 nmol/min/gm of cornea and 1.48 mM, respectively. After a topical dose of 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride to rabbit eyes, rapid absorption of levobunolol and facila formation of dihydrobunolol were noted. The drug concentration in the eye drop (approximately 17 mM) was much higher than Km and would saturate the epithelial reductase system in the cornea during drug absorption. The total concentrations of levobunolol and dihydrobunolol in ocular tissues were in the micromolar range throughout the experimental period. Dihydrobunolol, after distribution equilibrium, was the major drug-derived species in the cornea, aqueous humor, and iris-ciliary body. The study results indicated pH-dependent and capacity-limited formation of dihydrobunolol in the cornea. Buffering capacity and the drug concentration in the ophthalmic dose are important formulation strategies because they may affect the rate and the extent of dihydrobunolol formation in the epithelial cell layers of the cornea.", 
    "64": "We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 0.5% levobunolol HC1 (Vistagan) in 2,041 glaucoma patients at 143 sites in the Federal Republic of Germany. This study was a 3-month, open-label, noncomparative trial of levobunolol administered twice daily. Eighty-five percent of the patients completed the study period with well-controlled intraocular pressure (IOP). Treatment was discontinued in the remaining 15%: 7% for adverse reactions, 1% for lack of drug efficacy, and 7% for reasons unrelated to the study treatment. Efficacy, ocular drug tolerance, and systemic safety were judged as good to very good in approximately 80% of the patients. This large, postapproval study confirms previous findings of several well-controlled clinical trials indicating that levobunolol is an effective drug for the treatment of elevated IOP and is safe and comfortable for most patients.", 
    "65": "The ocular administration of a 50 microL instillation of bunolol hydrochloride, a beta 1- and beta 2- adrenoceptor blocking agent, resulted in significantly higher drug levels in the choroid/retina, iris, and ciliary body of pigmented rabbits compared with albino rabbits following topical administration. The concentrations in these tissues also persisted longer in the pigmented rabbits' eyes. However, no statistically significant differences in tissue levels were observed in the cornea or conjunctiva. The results of this study support the previously reported finding with timolol which showed longer retention of the drug in the iris, ciliary, choroid, and retina of pigmented rabbits than albinos.", 
    "66": "In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over study we investigated the haemodynamic effects of a beta-blocker (atenolol 50 mg) and a calcium antagonist (nifedipine SR 20 mg) given either separately or in combination in three groups of hypertensive patients. Each treatment was administered twice daily. The fixed combination given twice daily for four weeks produced reductions in blood pressure which lasted for at least 12 h after administration of the last dose. The control of blood pressure by the combination was superior to that achieved by its individual components. Adverse effects normally associated with nifedipine were less frequent when it was given with atenolol. Compliance with treatment was good, but best when the drugs were given together rather than separately. A fixed combination of atenolol and nifedipine may prove useful in treating hypertensive patients inadequately controlled on beta-blocker therapy alone.", 
    "67": "Ninety-two eyes with newly-diagnosed chronic open angle glaucoma (COAG) were treated in a randomised prospective trial with either timolol or pilocarpine. Their visual field survival was monitored on a 3-monthly basis over 2 years using both Goldmann and Friedmann perimetry. Concomitant tonometric data was derived by applanation. Fields were assessed and quantified using algorithms designed to give the greatest sensitivity for glaucomatous field loss. Microcomputer programmes specifically designed for this purpose were used in the data collection and subsequent analysis.", 
    "68": "The antihypertensive efficacy of urapidil was compared with that of atenolol in a double-blind randomised parallel-group 10-week study. 44 patients with essential hypertension entered the study, and 43 with a supine DBP of 100 to 125 mm Hg after a 2-week placebo period were randomised either to urapidil (n = 22; 60 to 120 mg/day) or atenolol (n = 21; 50 to 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram (supine and standing) and side effects were recorded every week, and medical examinations and laboratory tests were done at the end of the placebo and active treatments. 36 patients completed the trial (17 on urapidil and 19 on atenolol). Patients' characteristics were similar in the two groups, and there were no differences between them in blood pressure and heart rate at the end of placebo period. Both drugs produced a significant fall in supine and standing blood pressure; urapidil decreased supine blood pressure from 164/109 to 150/96 (p less than 0.001), and atenolol decreased it from 167/111 to 146/94 mm Hg by week 8 (p less than 0.001). There were no differences in the blood pressure-reducing effects of the two drugs. There was no change in heart rate in the urapidil group, but a marked reduction occurred in the atenolol group, with significant differences from placebo and urapidil (p less than 0.001). Side effects were reported in 32% of the urapidil group and in 29% of the atenolol group; however, these were mild and transient in all but two patients (urapidil = 1, atenolol = 1) who were withdrawn.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The well-known limitations of traditional sphygmomanometer blood pressure measurements have led to the development of a number of invasive and non-invasive 24-h blood pressure monitoring techniques which provide information on blood pressure in daily life. A non-invasive portable blood pressure monitor (IRC Spacelab S5300 monitor) was used to assess the antihypertensive action of celiprolol, 400 mg once daily, in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study. After a washout period of 7 days, 15 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were subjected to three 24-h blood pressure recordings: at the end of washout, and after 1 month of placebo and celiprolol treatment. In the 10 responsive patients, celiprolol reduced 24-h systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate by 6.8%, 8.1% and 2.7%, respectively, when compared with placebo. The reduction in blood pressure was also evident during the night and the antihypertensive action of celiprolol was maintained 24-h after administration. Celiprolol had no effect on 24-h blood pressure or heart rate variability and, therefore, did not produce any alteration in cardiovascular homeostasis. These results demonstrate that celiprolol is an effective once daily treatment for hypertension.", 
    "70": "Disturbances of peripheral blood supply have hitherto been considered contra-indications to the use of beta-blockers. This is probably due to an initial increase in peripheral resistance seen with these agents. The question of whether beta-blockers should be used with caution, or not at all, in patients with peripheral arterial disease is of considerable clinical relevance, since coronary heart disease and hypertension often coexist with peripheral obliterative arterial disease. The influence of a single 200 mg dose of celiprolol on peripheral blood flow was studied in 17 male hypertensive patients (mean age: 61.4 years) with stage II peripheral vascular disease of the pelvis or upper leg. These patients were then treated with 200 mg/day celiprolol for a period of 6 weeks. Despite abstinence from physical training, the pain-free walking distance improved slightly during treatment, and the blood pressure and pulse rate were both reduced. Celiprolol did not adversely affect peripheral blood flow or clinical symptoms. This new beta-blocker, therefore, should not be contra-indicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease, in the form of intermittent claudication.", 
    "71": "Previous studies have shown that single dose or short-term administration of celiprolol does not impair pulmonary function in patients with asthma. The long-term effects of celiprolol and chlorthalidone on respiratory function in mild hypertensive asthmatic patients were compared. Following a 1-month placebo washout period, five patients were randomized to 3 months of treatment with celiprolol, and four patients were treated with chlorthalidone. This double-blind study was followed by a 12-month open trial in 13 asthmatics. Forced expiratory volume at the first second of expiration (FEV1) remained unchanged throughout the 12-month treatment period. This finding is of interest since a spontaneous decrease in FEV1 of 20 ml/year has been observed in recent surveys of asthmatic patients. No changes in peak expiratory flow rate or maximum expiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity were observed during the study, but measurements of FEV1 before and 2 h after drug administration indicated that celiprolol had no direct bronchodilating effect. The responsiveness to inhaled salbutamol was unaltered during the 12-month trial period, demonstrating that celiprolol does not block the beta 2-adrenoceptors on bronchial smooth muscle. Our results indicate that celiprolol is a safe long-term treatment for hypertension in asthmatic patients. Nevertheless, a survey of a large number of patients may be useful in order to detect individuals at risk, since sensitivity to beta-blockade may vary between patients.", 
    "72": "The actions of celiprolol and chlorthalidone on lung function were studied in a randomized double-blind study of 30 patients. At the end of a 4-week placebo run-in period each patient had a supine diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 115 mmHg, and a forced expiratory volume at the first second of expiration (FEV1) 50-80% of the predicted value in patients with bronchial asthma, and between 40% and 70% of the predicted value in patients with chronic airways obstruction. The active treatment period lasted 12 weeks during which patients received either celiprolol, 200-600 mg daily, or chlorthalidone 12.5-37.5 mg daily. Lung function, blood pressure and heart rate were measured and assessed every 2 weeks during active treatment. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced during treatment with both drugs, but FEV1, forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume at 25-75% of vital capacity were not significantly altered. These results suggest that celiprolol does not adversely affect pulmonary function in hypertensive patients who also have chronic bronchial obstruction.", 
    "73": "We compared the potential beta-receptor blocker, B 24/76 i.e. 1-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-3[2-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanolamino]-prop an-2-ol, which is characterized by beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulating properties with propranolol. The studies were performed using an experimental model of isoproterenol-induced heart hypertrophy in rats. A correlation of the blood pressure was neither found in the development nor in the attempt to suppress the development of heart hypertrophy with the two beta-receptor blockers. Both beta-blockers influenced the development of hypertrophy to a different, but not reproducible extent. It was possible to suppress the increased ornithine decarboxylase activity with both beta-blockers in hypertrophied hearts, but there was no effect on the heart mass. Neither propranolol nor B 24/76 could stop the changes in the characteristic myosin isoenzyme pattern of the hypertrophied rat heart. Thus, the investigations did not provide any evidence that the beta-receptor blockers propranolol and B 24/76 have the potency to prevent isoproterenol from producing heart hypertrophy.", 
    "74": "The antihypertensive effects of the new cardioselective beta-blocker celiprolol and acebutolol have been compared. Thirty patients with arterial hypertension WHO Grade I-II were treated in a double-blind fashion with celiprolol or acebutolol. Before starting the treatment and on Days 15 and 29, before the morning dose, blood samples were taken for measurement of the plasma level of celiprolol. At the same times physical examinations, and clinical and urine chemistry analyses were performed. At the 99% probability level both drugs had significantly lowered the systolic and diastolic blood pressures to normal values at the end of the second and fourth weeks. There was no significant difference between their antihypertensive efficacy. The decrease in diastolic blood pressure at the end of the second week was significantly correlated with the reciprocal of the plasma celiprolol concentration at steady-state at the end of the dosage interval.", 
    "75": "36 patients with previously untreated essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were treated with a fixed dose combination of atenolol 50 mg and sustained release nifedipine 20 mg once daily for a mean period of 12.1 months. Echocardiography showed a significant decrease after a mean period of 7.9 months in interventricular septal thickness (13.6%, p less than 0.01), posterior wall thickness (12.6%, p less than 0.001) and left ventricular mass index (18.3%). After 12.1 months the reductions were 20.7% (p less than 0.001), 22.5% (p less than 0.001) and 30.8% (p less than 0.001), respectively. Posterior wall thickness was significantly reduced, but left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and fractional shortening remained unchanged. Treatment significantly reduced resting blood pressure from 153/105 mm Hg to 122/79 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and exercise blood pressure at 100W from 189/109 to 157/93 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Thus, nifedipine in combination with atenolol produces significant blood pressure reduction accompanied by regression of left ventricular hypertrophy without noticeable changes in left ventricular function."
