    "0": "Comparative efficiency of obsidan, novocainamide and placebo was studied in patients with ventricular extrasystole of varying origins. Obsidan administered in a dose providing a beta-blocking effect is no less effective than novocainamide in terms of antiarrhythmic activity. Owing to this level of efficiency, obsidan can be recommended for long-term treatment of ventricular extrasystole.", 
    "1": "Mechanisms of vascular hypertrophy induced by hypertension were studied in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke-prone SHR (SHRSP) and compared with those from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Fetal calf serum-stimulated ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity of cultured smooth muscle cells was greater in SHR and SHRSP than in WKY. Beta- but not alpha-adrenergic agonist stimulated ODC activity acutely in cultured smooth muscle cells from WKY, and isoprenaline-induced activation was blocked by the beta-blocker, propranolol, and enhanced by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. These results indicate that cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from SHR and SHRSP are more prone to increase the protein synthesis than those from WKY through the trophic induction of ODC activity and that the regulation of ODC activity by catecholamines is mediated through beta-agonistic effect in cultured smooth muscle cells.", 
    "2": "We investigated the effect of chlorpromazine on myocardial phospholipid content and composition and on myocardial creatine kinase (CK) activity in rats with isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage. A single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (40 mg/kg) increased heart weight but decreased myocardial phospholipid content and CK activity 24 h after administration. Total phospholipid content was significantly correlated with myocardial CK activity. The decrease of total phospholipid content was accompanied by an increase of the lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)/phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio, indicating that conversion from PC to LPC had occurred. Intraperitoneal injection of chlorpromazine (30 mg/kg) prior to isoproterenol injection inhibited the decrease in total phospholipid content and CK activity and the increase in the LPC/PC ratio, but did not affect the increase in heart weight. Pretreatment with propranolol (20 mg/kg) reversed the effects of isoproterenol. On the other hand, dexamethasone (12 mg/kg) and verapamil (50 mg/kg) had no significant effects on the above parameters of myocardial damage. These results suggest that prevention of myocardial phospholipid disruption inhibits enzyme depletion from the myocardium and that chlorpromazine helps to prevent isoproterenol-induced myocardial damage by improving phospholipid metabolism.", 
    "3": "The electromechanical effects of amrinone on isolated guinea pig papillary muscle were studied at various driving frequencies and under the influence of several antagonists and a low calcium medium. Amrinone (3 X 10(-5)-2 X 10(-3)M) caused a positive inotropic effect on preparations driven at 1.0 Hz in a concentration-dependent manner. When the preparations were driven at a frequency lower than 0.5 Hz, the positive inotropic effect of the drug was markedly attenuated. Amrinone caused a significant prolongation in action potential duration at an early repolarization phase--but not at a late repolarization phase--without affecting any other parameters of action potential. These effects of amrinone were not blocked by a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist or tetrodotoxin, but were inhibited by treatment with verapamil (5 X 10(-6)M) or a low calcium medium (0.1 or 0.3 mM). In papillary muscles depolarized by 30 mM [K+]o, amrinone enhanced the slow action potentials. In voltage clamp experiments using a single sucrose-gap method, amrinone (6 X 10(-4)M) caused a marked increase in the peak amplitude of the slow inward current, while it did not affect the net outward current. The results suggest that the slow calcium inward current may play a predominant role in the positive inotropic effect of amrinone.", 
    "4": "We evaluated the clinical pharmacology of prizidilol, a compound with vasodilator and beta-blocking properties, in 12 hypertensive patients with normal renal function. A single dose of 600 mg prizidilol was given orally and blood samples were withdrawn at intervals for high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded every hour in supine and standing positions. A nitroglycerin test was performed at the 2nd, 4th, and 6th h for evaluation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptor activity. Results were compared with those after placebo intake the day before. Prizidilol produced a significant decrease in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures (-22 and -24%, respectively), with a maximum effect 5 h after intake. Blood pressure changes were not different in slow and fast acetylators, suggesting that the acetylated metabolites were active. Heart rate decreased slightly but significantly during the first 2 h, but was similar to control levels thereafter. However, the nitroglycerin test data suggested a prolonged blockade of beta-adrenoceptor activity. Pharmacokinetics showed large variations among patients; several peaks were observed on the curves, indicating irregular absorption. The apparent plasma elimination half-life was 4.4 +/- 0.4 h. Total body clearance was high despite a very low renal clearance, indicating that the drug was eliminated mainly by the metabolic or intestinal route. No significant correlations were found among plasma concentration, blood pressure, and heart rate. In conclusion, prizidilol is a potent antihypertensive drug having equilibrated vasodilator and beta-blocking effects. The pharmacokinetic data suggest a first-pass effect and elimination by extra-renal routes.", 
    "5": "We studied two new agents, alinidine (St 567, 2-[N-allyl-N-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-amino]-2-imidazoline) and AQ-A 39 (5,6-dimethoxy-2-[3[[alpha-(3,4-dimethoxy)-phenylethyl] methylamino]propyl]phthalimidine), in isolated guinea pig atria with respect to their specificity to decrease heart rate but not contractility during beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. Spontaneous electrical activity in sinoatrial node preparations was increased by perfusion with isoprenaline (0.1 micrograms/ml); addition of alinidine (3 micrograms/ml), AQ-A 39 (3 micrograms/ml), or propranolol (0.03-0.3 micrograms/ml) reduced sinus rate to the control values. The same concentrations of these drugs were tested in electrically driven (1 Hz) left atria. The positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline was not affected by alinidine and AQ-A 39; however, it was markedly reduced or abolished by propranolol. The experiments, therefore, demonstrated the bradycardic specificity of alinidine and AQ-A 39 under conditions of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. A cumulative concentration-response curve for the positive chronotropic effect of isoprenaline was established in spontaneously beating atria. AQ-A 39, 1 and 10 micrograms/ml, reduced the control sinus rate but did not affect the following concentration-response curve of isoprenaline. A similar result was published earlier for alinidine and excludes an interaction of both drugs with isoprenaline on a possible subgroup of selective beta-adrenoceptors in the sinoatrial node.", 
    "6": "It has been suggested that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents may impair the training response but that this may not occur if the agent possesses partial agonist activity (PAA). We tested these hypotheses in 39 male patients, following myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, who underwent structured exercise training three times a week for 8 weeks. Exercise tolerance was assessed before training, within 5 days after training, and again 2 weeks after training in 14 patients receiving acebutolol (with PAA), 12 patients receiving sotalol (without PAA), and 13 patients receiving placebo. Blood levels of both agents confirmed that steady states sufficient to produce beta-blockade were achieved during training. All three groups of patients demonstrated statistically significant improvements in exercise duration, energy expenditure, heart rates attained performing equal work loads, and percentage functional aerobic impairment. No significant differences were found between the three groups before or after training. We conclude that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in standard therapeutic doses do not cause impairment of exercise training and that PAA affords no enhancement of the training response.", 
    "7": "This study was designed to assess the relative antiarrhythmic activity of fixed doses of 2 beta-adrenergic blocking agents, propranolol and acebutolol, in a prospective double-blind crossover trial. Twenty-one patients who had at least 30 premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per hour while receiving placebo were entered into the study. Ten patients were randomized to initially receive propranolol, 40 mg every 8 hours, and 11 were assigned to receive acebutolol, 300 mg every 8 hours. After 6 weeks of treatment, patients were weaned off medication for 1 week and then placed on placebo for 1 week. Eighteen patients were available and eligible for crossover to the alternative regimen for an additional 6 weeks. All 21 patients completed courses with propranolol and 17 completed courses with acebutolol. The mean number of PVCs per hour during placebo, propranolol and acebutolol treatment were 267, 87 and 119, respectively. Using paired t test statistics on observation differences, both propranolol and acebutolol significantly reduced the number of PVCs per hour compared with placebo, whereas similar analysis revealed no significant difference in the antiarrhythmic effect. However, with the current sample size the power of the test is too low for the latter conclusion to be stated with confidence. Side effects were mild and infrequent, requiring discontinuation of acebutolol in 2 patients and discontinuation of propranolol in 1. Thus, acebutolol is a safe and effective antiarrhythmic agent and compares favorably with propranolol.", 
    "8": "The effects of a single intravenous infusion of prenalterol, a beta 1 selective agonist, on haemodynamics (echocardiography) and venous plasma catecholamine concentration were studied in 8 patients with severe congestive heart failure. In these patients, age-adjusted plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels before prenalterol infusion were higher compared to values found in 10 control healthy subjects (both P less than 0.01). In heart failure patients, circulating NE levels were not dissimilar in 2 samples drawn 60 and 0 minutes before commencing prenalterol infusion (772.0 +/- 131 ng/l [mean +/- SD] and 775.5 +/- 130.0 ng/l respectively). Prenalterol induced a significant improvement in the cardiac index, stroke index, ejection fraction and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening, associated with a moderate but significant decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. All these changes persisted for 60 minutes after the end of infusion. Circulating NE levels were 604.0 +/- 125 ng/l at 60 min. after start of infusion (P less than 0.01 vs pre-infusion levels) and 526.1 +/- 108 ng/l at 60 min. after the end of infusion (P less than 0.01 vs pre-infusion levels). Plasma E showed a slight decrease, which did not attain statistical significance. Heart rate and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged during and after infusion, while systolic blood pressure increased by 10-15 mmHg during and after infusion. We conclude that a single 1-hour prenalterol infusion in patients with severe congestive heart failure induces an haemodynamic improvement associated with a reduction of previously elevated circulating NE levels. This reduction could indicate a lowering in the intensity of the afferent stimulus for the reflex sympathetic overactivity.", 
    "9": "Hemodynamic variables were measured in 34 patients with isolated systolic hypertension before and after acute administration of propranolol. The patients were separated into two groups, those younger than and those older than 45 years of age, respectively. After drug administration, systolic pressure decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) in younger subjects with a concomitant increase in rapid ejection time (P less than 0.001). In the older patients, cardiac and peripheral factors determining systolic pressure were each altered after beta-adrenergic blockade. The most striking result was the reduction in systemic arterial compliance (P less than 0.01) probably due to unmasked alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction. This arterial effect explains the lack of systolic pressure reduction despite a decrease in cardiac performance.", 
    "10": "The vascular effects of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were examined in the isolated perfused mesenteric arteries of the rabbit. Bolus injections of ATP (1 X 10(-8) to 10(-6) mol) induced a dose-dependent vasoconstrictor response at resting perfusion pressure, while continuous perfusion with ATP briefly elicited a vasoconstrictor response which was not maintained. Perfusion with phentolamine (2.65 X 10(-6) M, an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker), indomethacin (8.37 X 10(-6) M, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase), atropine (1 X 10(-7) M, a muscarinic receptor blocker), and hydralazine (2 X 10(-4) M, a vascular smooth muscle inhibitor) for a period of 1 h had no effect on vasoconstrictor responses to ATP. However, pretreatment with reserpine (2 mg X kg-1 X day-1 for 2 days), an agent which depletes catecholamines, potentiated responses to ATP. On the other hand, when vascular tone was increased with an isoosmotic 60 mM K+ depolarizing Krebs bicarbonate solution, bolus injections of ATP elicited a prominent dose-dependent vasoconstriction followed by a prominent vasodilation. The degree of vasodilation but not of vasoconstriction elicited by ATP was greater in small terminal arteries with branches (less than 0.5 mm outside diameter (o.d.) ) than in the medium size arteries (less than or equal to 1 mm o.d.) without terminal branches. Both the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses were unaffected by a perfusion with atropine, indomethacin, or eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA, 1 X 10(-4) M) for 1-2 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Mitral valve prolapse is the most common form of heart disease, as it occurs in 4 to 6 per cent of the population. It has a benign course in the majority of cases, but 5 types of severe complication can occur in 15 per cent of cases. Mitral incompetence occurs in 14.8 per cent of cases. It may develop gradually or suddenly, following rupture of the chordae, which requires rapid surgical repair. Mitral valve prolapse is complicated by infectious endocarditis in 2.9 per cent of cases, hence the need for antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental treatment or surgery in patients with a pan-systolic or end-systolic murmur. The only arrhythmias which should be considered as complications and treated as such are frequent ventricular extrasystoles of more than 30 per hour, usually associated with bigeminy, runs or polymorphism, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Treatment consists, primarily, of beta-blockers. Sudden death is of course the major complication, occurring in 1.4 to 2.4 per cent of cases. The patients at risk of this complication are middle-aged women (40 years) with a past history of syncope or faintness due, in most cases, to episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Apart from arrhythmia, coronary artery spasm has also been found to be a cause of sudden death in these patients. Transient or definitive ocular and cerebral ischaemic episodes can also complicate mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse is found in 20 to 30 per cent of patients with neurological accidents before the age of 45. Preventative treatment consists of anti-platelet aggregation agents and anticoagulants in recurrent cases.", 
    "12": "Pial arterial and venous calibre were continuously recorded through a closed cranial window preparation during cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation in 10 cats before and after alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. In addition, the intracranial pressure (ICP) was simultaneously recorded in 4 of the cats. Under resting conditions 33 arteries (mean diameter 130 micron) constricted by 11.7 +/- 0.8% and 80 venous portions (mean diameter 152 micron) constricted by 13.7 +/- 0.7% during sympathetic nerve stimulation. ICP decreased simultaneously by 16.5 +/- 6.2%. Administration of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine i.v. (1.5 mg X kg-1) abolished the reduction of ICP and markedly reduced, but did not completely abolish, the constrictor response of arteries and veins. The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1.5 mg X kg-1) did not significantly alter the reduction of ICP or the response of pial veins and small arteries, whereas the response of arteries with a diameter greater than 150 micron was attenuated. It is concluded that the constriction of pial veins and arteries during sympathetic stimulation is mediated predominantly via alpha-adrenoceptors. The sympathetic nerves of cerebral blood vessels may have stronger influence on the cerebral capacitance than on resistance vessels under normotensive and normocapnic conditions.", 
    "13": "Drug-induced oesophageal lesions have attracted increasing attention during the past few years. A test model is presented for assessing irritative or ulcerogenic effects of potential drugs on the oesophagus. In this model the pig oesophagus is used, as it is more similar to the human oesophagus than models used in other techniques that have been suggested. The beta-blockers, alprenolol and propranolol, displayed the same ulcerogenic properties with this test model as reported with other test models in the literature. The beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol, did not have such ulcerogenic effects. The pig model is suggested as the method of choice in evaluating the potential irritative or ulcerogenic effects of pharmaceutical formulations intended for human use.", 
    "14": "Radioactive microspheres (15 mu) were used to measure regional cerebral blood flow during intravenous infusion of nicotine (36 micrograms/kg/min) in anesthetized, open chest dogs. Experiments were conducted with uncontrolled mean aortic pressure and intact autonomic receptors (Series I; n = 9), and in four groups of dogs with mean aortic pressure held constant (Series II); 1) with intact autonomic receptors (n = 6), 2) after beta adrenergic blockade (n = 8), 3) after alpha and beta adrenergic blockade (n = 6), 4) after alpha and beta adrenergic and cholinergic blockade (n = 4). In Series I, nicotine raised mean aortic pressure (+ 72%) and increased flow in cerebral cortex (+ 67%), cerebellum (+ 38%), pons (+ 46%), medulla (+ 39%), and spinal cord (+ 48%). In all regions, but cortex, increases in vascular resistance limited nicotine-induced increases in flow. In Series II, nicotine changed flow only in cortex. Without blockade, nicotine increased cortical flow (+ 38%); but beta blockade abolished this increase in flow. After alpha and beta blockade nicotine again raised cortical flow (+ 29%), and additional cholinergic blockade had no effect on this response. It is concluded that nicotine causes predominant beta receptor mediated vasodilation in cerebral cortex, although it also activates alpha (vasoconstrictor) receptors and a non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic vasodilator mechanism in this region of brain.", 
    "15": "Fourteen male physical education students performed a single bout of running until exhaustion on the treadmill at 22 km/h and 7.5% slope. They received single oral doses of 100 mg bupranolol (nonselective beta-blockade), 100 mg metoprolol (beta-1-selective blockade), and placebo 60-90 min before running. Arterialized capillary blood was sampled repeatedly until 30 min after exercise for assessment of lactate and glucose. Adrenaline and noradrenaline were determined in venous plasma before and immediately after exercise. Running time until exhaustion was 49.3 +/- 2.3 s in the control experiment, 44.5 +/- 2.0 s with metoprolol, and 42.7 +/- 2.0 s with bupranolol. The reductions under beta-blockade were statistically significant. With both beta-blockers the increases of the lactate and glucose blood levels were significantly reduced, the levels being almost identical with metoprolol and bupranolol. The post-exercise levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline did not differ significantly between the control, metoprolol, and bupranolol experiments. It is concluded that determination of the lactate and glucose levels in blood did not allow assessment of the mechanism by which beta-blockade impairs the capacity for supramaximal exercise. Besides reduced anaerobic energy release due to inhibition of glycogenolysis, other beta-blocker effects are considered.", 
    "16": "Heart rate and blood and muscle lactate concentrations were studied in 15 physically active males during submaximal exercise before and after oral administration of 80 mg propranolol (Inderal). First, a cycle exercise protocol, with a stepwise increased exercise intensity (30 W every 4 min until voluntary exhaustion) was performed before and after beta-blockade. Blood samples for lactate determination were obtained before each exercise intensity increase. In a second set of experiments, the procedure was repeated before and after beta-blockade, but exercise was terminated at the exercise corresponding to a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol X l-1 l-1, as determined beforehand without beta-blockade (i.e., the same absolute work load was compared with and without beta-blockade), and a muscle biopsy was taken from m. vastus lateralis for subsequent lactate analyses. Following beta-blockade at low and high work loads, the heart rate decreased similarly by 22%-26%. Blood lactate concentration was unchanged at exercise intensities up to 150 W. At higher exercise intensities (180-240 W), a significant increase (P less than 0.05 - P less than 0.01) in blood lactate concentration occurred after beta-blockade. Muscle lactate concentration was unaffected by beta-blockade at a work load (130-230 W) where blood lactate was higher with than without blockade. Assuming a reduced blood flow to the exercising muscle, there are reasons to speculate that lactate production was diminished following beta-blockade even though blood lactate increased probably as a result of reduced lactate uptake by other organs.", 
    "17": "The changes in systolic time intervals (STI) following reduction of adrenergic activity was used to validate supine resting plasma catecholamines (CATs) as an index of sympathetic activity. Blockade of sympathetic activity was achieved by two means in two groups: propranolol (10 mg i.v.) and clonidine (0.3 mg p.o.). The diminished sympathetic effect was evidenced by slowing (p less than 0.01) of heart rate with both drugs and the reduction (p less than 0.01) of blood pressure with clonidine. There was no correlation in our study between resting plasma CATs (norepinephrine alone or total), and changes in heart rate and preejection period (PEP). Moreover, to avoid changes in PEP that could be related to differences in blood pressure levels (clonidine-reduced blood pressure while propranolol did not), the changes in PEP were corrected for the change of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the same patients (delta PEP/(delta MAP and % delta PEP/% delta MAP). No correlation could be found, still, between resting supine plasma CATs and these ratios. The difficulty in demonstrating a correlation between resting plasma CATs and the immediate cardiac response to adrenolytic agents can be explained by the number of factors influencing plasma levels. Circulating plasma CATs represent the spillover from adrenergic nerve endings, and, therefore, their level would depend on several factors including sympathetic nervous system activity, rate of reuptake, and rate of degradation.", 
    "18": "Previous studies have demonstrated a larger oral bioavailability of (+)- as compared to (-)-propranolol in the dog. The objective of the present study was to examine how this difference is reflected in the metabolism in the drug. The stereochemical composition of propranolol and its metabolites was, therefore, determined in the urine of four dogs after single 160-mg oral doses of stable isotope-labeled pseudoracemates of propranolol. All major metabolites, accounting for 84% of the dose excreted in urine, were isolated by solvent extraction or HPLC, glucuronic acid conjugates after enzymatic hydrolysis, and analyzed by GC/MS after chemical derivatization. Of the three primary metabolic pathways, glucuronidation of the parent drug, about 16% of the dose recovered in urine, was highly selective for (-)-propranolol, (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio 3.5. In contrast, all of the side-chain oxidation metabolites, about 30% of the dose, were mainly derived from (+)-propranolol, (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio ranging from 0.35 to 0.74. Ring oxidation, involved in the metabolism of the remainder of the dose studied, about 38%, was, however, also found to be selective for (-)-propranolol, with the greatest selectivity observed in 4'-hydroxypropranolol, (-/(+)-enantiomer ratio 1.49. There was an excellent mass balance for the enantiomers of the metabolites studied, i.e. the total (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio was close to unity. The higher oral bioavailability of (+)-propranolol in the dog, well reflected in the stereochemical composition of unchanged propranolol in urine, is suggested to be due to stereoselective presystemic hepatic removal of (-)-propranolol by glucuronidation and ring oxidation.", 
    "19": "Aqueous humor levels were determined over time after the topical administration to rabbit eyes of 1% isotonic buffered (pH 7.3) solutions of three beta-blocking agents, acebutolol hydrochloride, timolol maleate, and bufuralol hydrochloride (arranged in order of increasing lipophilicity). Corneal permeability coefficients, determined from a previous in vitro study, were inversely related to the observed time to peak for the three drugs, as expected. Two of the drugs, bufuralol and timolol, did not give the expected rank order for Cmax and AUC, which could result from differences in distribution and/or elimination processes. Aqueous boundary layers were postulated for in vivo corneal permeability which suggested that bufuralol and timolol may have nearly identical effective permeability coefficients in vivo.", 
    "20": "Rabbit corneas were excised and mounted in a chamber to determine the permeability characteristics of a group of beta-blocking agents. By measuring the permeability rate of each drug across intact cornea, stroma alone, epithelium-stroma, and stroma-endothelium, it was possible to determine the resistance to penetration for each corneal layer. The reciprocal of the sum of resistances for the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium equaled the experimentally determined permeability coefficient for the intact cornea (104 +/- 6.0%). Thus, the penetration of beta-blocking agents through the excised rabbit cornea could be treated as three barriers in series. For hydrophilic compounds, the epithelium was the rate-determining barrier. The endothelium offered less resistance, whereas the stroma offered only very minimal resistance. The lipophilic compounds penetrated the excised cornea more rapidly. However, the stroma became rate-determining for the most lipophilic compounds (penbutolol, bufuralol, bevantolol, and propranolol). Although the octanol-buffer (pH 7.65) distribution coefficient of these compounds varied over a fourfold logarithmic range, the permeability coefficient was considered nearly constant [3.4 X 10(-5) (+/- 0.34) cm/sec] for stroma. Also, the ratios of tortuosity to porosity for the stromal layer were 1.58 +/- 0.15. These results suggest that drug diffuses through an aqueous media of gel-like mucopolysaccharide interspersed by a matrix of collagen fibrils. From further analyses intra- and intercellular pathways for epithelium and endothelium were added to the model resulting in a sigmoidal representation of permeability coefficient versus distribution coefficient. However, the intercellular (pore) pathway could not be adequately quantified because of the variation in the data for very hydrophilic compounds.", 
    "21": "Rabbit corneas were excised and mounted in a chamber to determine the permeability characteristics of a group of beta-blocking agents which varied in octanol-water partitioning over a fourfold logarithmic range. From the permeability rate at steady state, permeability coefficients (pH 7.65) were determined. For each drug the distribution coefficient and pKa were measured, permitting the partition coefficients to be estimated. Various correlations were determined for the log permeability coefficient as a sum of log functions of the partition (or distribution) coefficient, molecular weight, and/or degree of ionization. The best fit, as judged by a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.9756) and lack of systematic deviation, was represented by: log PT = 0.623 log DC - 0.108(log DC)2 - 5.0268.", 
    "22": "Although the benzodiazepines have been proven effective and safe in the treatment of anxiety, research has continued in an effort to find agents that lack sedative effects and abuse/dependence liability, and do not potentiate the effects of CNS depressants. Although several nonbenzodiazepine agents have shown anxiolytic effects, most are ineffective, or their efficacy not proven, in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). One nonbenzodiazepine, buspirone, has shown significant efficacy in treating GAD in comparisons with placebo and reference compounds. Further investigations are necessary to assess effects of use over time.", 
    "23": "The extent to which beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs counteract the biochemical responses to an infusion of terbutaline, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, has been investigated. In this study the beta 1-selectivity of metoprolol was compared with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol. The hypokalaemia produced by an infusion of terbutaline was reduced by low dose (50 mg) and high dose (200 mg) metoprolol and by low dose (40 mg) and high dose (160 mg) propranolol. The effects of propranolol on terbutaline induced hypokalaemia were more marked than those of metoprolol at both low dose (P = 0.01) and high dose (P = 0.05). Furthermore low dose metoprolol had less effect than high dose metoprolol (P = 0.05). The serum potassium appeared to rise slightly after propranolol. Low and high doses of both beta-adrenoceptor blockers markedly reduced the terbutaline-induced hyperglycaemia, but the differences between the two drugs were not statistically significant.", 
    "24": "To determine the importance of beta-adrenergic activity during hypoxia in the fetus, 13 studies were carried out on seven chronically instrumented sheep at nine tenths of gestation. Hypoxia was induced by having the mother breathe gas mixtures that resulted in a reduction of maternal arterial oxygen tension to 32 mm Hg. Hypoxia resulted in a decrease in fetal heart rate (165 +/- 17 to 140 +/- 28 bpm) and fetal oxygen consumption (5.9 +/- 1.3 to 3.0 +/- 1.5 ml/min/kg) and increases in fetal arterial and umbilical venous pressures. There was no change in umbilical blood flow (209 +/- 58 ml/min/kg). Propranolol, 1.1 ml/kg, was rapidly infused into a fetal vein to achieve complete beta-adrenergic blockade. Umbilical vascular resistance increased significantly, fetal heart rate decreased to 112 +/- 22 bpm, and umbilical blood flow decreased to 165 +/- 73 ml/min/kg. There was no further decrease in fetal oxygen consumption. These decreases are approximately twice those seen after propranolol without hypoxia. These findings suggest that during hypoxia there is an increase in beta-adrenergic activity, which tends to maintain fetal heart rate and umbilical blood flow. This activity counteracts the increase in vagal activity with hypoxia, which decreases heart rate.", 
    "25": "Patients with unstable angina pectoris who remain symptomatic at rest after hospitalization are at increased risk of death or myocardial infarction. This report presents the results of adding the calcium influx blocking agent nifedipine to aggressive therapy with nitrates and beta-blocking drugs in 47 hospitalized patients. The patients were followed up for an average of 12 months. Twenty-two (47%) improved sufficiently to be discharged; despite this symptomatic improvement, 8 had cardiac events within 4 months. Eighteen patients had no symptomatic improvement and 7 of them had cardiac events in 4 months. In 7 others, relief was insufficient to permit discharge, and 1 of these patients had myocardial infarction. In all, 31 patients were treated with medical therapy only. Twenty-one of these patients had a favorable short-term response to nifedipine; 13 died or had an infarction in less than 4 months. Two of 16 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery had cardiac events. The presence of electrocardiographic changes with pain did not identify either a group at higher risk or a group with a better outcome with nifedipine. We conclude that in a high-risk subset of patients with unstable angina pectoris, nifedipine does not reduce morbidity or mortality or the need for bypass surgery, but relieves symptoms in many patients. An early symptomatic response to nifedipine did not predict a reduced incidence of subsequent cardiac events.", 
    "26": "The effects of third ventricular (3V) injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (PROPR), a selective beta 1-antagonist, metoprolol (MET), a selective beta 2-antagonist, IPS 339, and a beta-adrenergic agonist (-) isoproterenol (ISOPR), on plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and growth hormone (GH) were studied in conscious, ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Samples were removed from unrestrained rats which had been previously implanted with atrial and 3V cannulae, and plasma hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Intraventricular injection of PROPR (30 micrograms), MET (40 micrograms), or IPS 339 (20 micrograms) induced a gradual elevation in plasma GH concentrations, whereas ISOPR (30 micrograms) reduced plasma GH. ISOPR (30 micrograms) brought about a decrease in plasma LH concentrations, but PROPR, MET and IPS 339 had no effect on LH levels. PROPR (30 micrograms) increased plasma FSH concentrations, but there was no significant effect of MET, IPS 339 or ISOPR on FSH secretion. The results indicate that the beta-adrenergic system can inhibit the release of GH, LH, and FSH. This system appears to have a tonic inhibitory effect on GH and FSH but not LH release in the OVX rat.", 
    "27": "In this study, 10 congeners of isoproterenol were systematically synthesized and pharmacologically tested in both in vitro and in vivo systems. The aim was to produce compounds that were more potent and had effects different from those of the parent compound and that could ultimately be attached covalently to inert peptide carriers offering versatility in size, pK, and other physicochemical properties. The congeners synthesized were tested in the S49 mouse lymphoma assay for their ability to stimulate cyclic AMP accumulation and were shown to have potencies relative to isoproterenol ranging from 4 orders of magnitude less potent to 4 orders of magnitude more potent than isoproterenol in eliciting this response. Some of the congeners were also tested in a guinea pig isolated atrial preparation, a rat blood pressure assay, a guinea pig bronchodilation assay, and an anesthetized dog preparation. In these assays, the congeners were shown to have the same types of activities as in the S49 cell assay. The results of these studies indicate that structural modifications distant from the catecholamine moiety dramatically alter the pharmacological profile of the congeners versus the parent compound, resulting in a series of ligands with a wide range of activities.", 
    "28": "A nonfusing variant of L6 muscle cells was used to study the interactions of 16 agonists and 8 antagonists with beta-adrenergic receptors. Membranes prepared from L6 cells and intact cells in monolayer culture were used. Beta-adrenergic receptors on broken cells and on intact cells had the same affinities for all of the antagonists studied. Studies of the inhibition of the binding of [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol by agonists indicated that two states of the receptor can exist on intact cells attached to the substratum. The form of the receptor normally present on intact cells appeared to have the same properties as receptors on membranes when assayed in the presence of GTP. Several full agonists converted this form of the receptor to a form which had a 40- to 50-fold lower affinity for agonists. This conversion appeared to occur during the first few minutes of exposure to an agonist. Four of the agonists tested did not convert any of the receptors on intact cells to a form with a low affinity for agonists. Included in this group of agents were two full agonists and two partial agonists. Therefore, interactions of these drugs with receptors on broken or intact cells were the same. Several other full and partial agonists converted some of the receptors on intact cells to a low-affinity form, and their interactions with receptors on intact cells were characterized by shallow inhibition curves. The conversion of beta-adrenergic receptors on intact cells to a low-affinity state did not appear to be a prerequisite for the decrease in the rate of agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation that occurs 1-2 min after exposure of L6 cells to agonists. Studies were also carried out on viable intact cells detached from plates following brief exposure to trypsin or EDTA. The properties of receptors on suspended cells were the same as those of receptors on broken cells when assayed in the presence of GTP, rather than being similar to the properties of receptors on attached cells. In summary, data are presented indicating that agonists with the same potency and intrinsic activity in membrane preparations (and intact cells in suspension) can interact very differently with beta-adrenergic receptors on intact cells attached to the substratum. Thus, certain agonists cause a rapid conversion of beta-adrenergic receptors to a form which has a low affinity for agonists. This effect is seen with some but not all agonists and is seen only in studies with attached cells.", 
    "29": "A series of binary (aryloxy)propanolamines has been prepared and examined in vitro and in vivo for beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity. These symmetrical compounds consist of two (S)-(phenyloxy)propanolamine pharmacophores coupled through alkylenedioxy or poly(oxyethylenedioxy) linking units of varying lengths. Examples of such binary compounds linked through the 2,2', 3,3', and 4,4' positions in the aromatic rings of the pharmacophores have been prepared. In vitro and in vivo test data indicate that the 2,2' compounds tend to be selective beta 2-adrenergic blocking agents, the 4,4' binaries tend to be selective beta 1-blocking agents, and those compounds with 3,3' linkages exhibit intermediate selectivities. One of the 4,4'-linked binary compounds, 4s, exhibited potent, cardioselective beta-blockade in vivo, which was of short duration and was accompanied by a prolonged tachycardia.", 
    "30": "Conjugates of low molecular weight amines with inert peptide carriers can be made to preserve some pharmacologic effects of the ligand. No previous studies of conjugates have systematically derivatized the ligand to optimize its activity or affinity to receptors; or have pharmacophores been selected for conjugation on the basis of their effects making them particularly interesting as ligands. Chemically pure and characterizable conjugates ranging from single blocked amino acid derivatives to isomeric pentapeptides were constructed and tested for beta adrenergic properties. Sixteen conjugates with varying water solubility, amino acid composition and sequence, charged groups and spacer length between ligand and carrier showed potencies and duration of action widely different from isoproterenol. In the in vitro S-49 mouse lymphoma assay a range of relative potencies (as compared to isoproterenol) from 10(-6) to 1 time as potent was obtained, whereas in the in vivo rat blood pressure assay these compounds were shown to be from one-fifth to 4 times as potent as isoproterenol. The most potent compound tested, Boc-Phe(NH)-Gly-NHCH3, was also tested in a guinea-pig atrial preparation as well as in an anesthetized cardiovascular dog preparation. The results indicated that the compound was approximately 3.5 times more potent in producing an inotropic response than isoproterenol. In some instances, ostensively trivial changes quite distant from the pharmacophores in amino acid sequence of the carrier made major changes in potency and efficacy of the compound.", 
    "31": "To assess antiarrhythmic efficacy of oral nadolol, 15 patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia were studied. Eight patients had atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia and seven had AV reciprocating tachycardia involving an accessory AV pathway. Electrophysiologic studies were performed before and after intravenous infusion of propranolol (0.20 mg/kg), and were repeated 5 to 8 days after oral nadolol therapy at a daily dose of 80 to 160 mg. Both intravenous propranolol and oral nadolol induced significant prolongation of the sinus cycle length from 741 +/- 73 ms to 834 +/- 97 and 1,029 +/- 95 ms, respectively (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.0001, respectively). Both intravenous propranolol and oral nadolol depressed AV nodal but not accessory AV pathway conduction, and shifted the dual AV nodal pathway conduction curves (A1A2, A2H2; A1A2, H1H2) upward and to the right by prolonging the conduction time and increasing the refractory period. Ten patients (seven with AV nodal reentry and three with AV reciprocation) who responded to intravenous propranolol also responded to oral nadolol with loss of the inducibility of sustained tachycardia; the remaining five patients (one with AV nodal reentry and four with AV reciprocation) who did not respond to intravenous propranolol also failed to respond to oral nadolol with persistence of the inducibility of sustained tachycardia. Thus, in conclusion, intravenous propranolol testing predicts the therapeutic efficacy of oral nadolol therapy and oral nadolol in once-daily doses may be used for long-term prophylaxis of recurrent supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "32": "The reappearance of beta-adrenergic receptors in C6-glioma cells after desensitization with isoproterenol was studied using the antagonist [3H]CGP-12177. Reappearance had the following properties: (a) it occurred in intact cells only, (b) it was temperature dependent, (c) it required an Na+/H+ gradient, low intracellular Ca2+ activity, and (d) it required ATP, and (e) intact lysosomes. The results suggest endocytosis and recycling of the beta-adrenergic receptor after agonist treatment.", 
    "33": "Although the role of the autonomic nervous system in the pathophysiology of heart failure has been studied for decades, only within the past few years have adrenergic receptors and their alterations occupied center stage. There is now considerable evidence linking such receptors to many of the phenomena of heart failure; recent work appears to have significant therapeutic implications.", 
    "34": "The effects of increasing doses of intravenous isoproterenol on left ventricular (LV) size and function were assessed before and after oral propranolol (80 mg). Eleven normal subjects were studied by M-mode echocardiography. The isoproterenol dose was increased until heart rate had risen by 25 to 30 b.p.m. LV end-diastolic (LVED) dimension (46.6 +/- 1.3 mm) was increased by isoproterenol (to 48.8 +/- 1.5 mm) and decreased by propranolol (to 45 +/- 1 mm). LV end-systolic dimension was decreased by isoproterenol and increased by propranolol. Isoproterenol increased LVED dimension despite the opposing effect of the tachycardia, whereas propranolol decreased LVED dimension despite its negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. These results suggest that nonselective beta-receptor stimulation or blockade can affect cardiac output through direct cardiac actions and by influencing venous return.", 
    "35": "To evaluate the comparative effects of medical and surgical therapy on quality of life of patients with stable ischemic heart disease, 780 patients who had been randomly assigned to medical or surgical therapy in the CASS were systematically followed for a mean of 5.5. years. Analysis was performed according to original treatment assignment. Patients in the surgical group had significantly less chest pain, fewer activity limitations, and required less therapy with nitrates and beta-blockers. Treadmill exercise tests performed 6, 18, and 60 months after entry documented significantly longer treadmill time, less exercise-induced angina, and less ST segment depression among surgical group patients. However, employment status and recreational status did not differ significantly between medical and surgical groups. Total number of hospitalizations after randomization was higher in the surgical group owing primarily to rehospitalization during the first year of follow-up for the coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Risk factors, including high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, high cholesterol levels, overweight, and poor exercise habits remained similar between medical and surgical groups. This randomized collaborative study shows that coronary artery bypass graft surgery improves the quality of life as manifested by relief of chest pain, improvement in both subjective and objective measurements of functional status, and a diminished requirement for drug therapy. However, no significant effect on employment or recreational status was observed.", 
    "36": "CASS includes a multicenter patient registry and a randomized controlled clinical trial. It is designed to assess the effect of coronary artery bypass surgery on mortality and selected nonfatal end points. From August 1975 to May 1979, 780 patients with stable ischemic heart disease were randomly assigned to receive surgical (n = 390) or nonsurgical (n = 390) treatment and were followed through April 15, 1983. At 5 years, the average annual mortality rate in patients assigned to surgical treatment was 1.1%. The annual mortality rate in those receiving medical therapy was 1.6%. Annual mortality rates in patients with single-, double-, and triple-vessel disease who were in the surgical group were 0.7%, 1.0%, and 1.5%; the corresponding rates in patients in the medical group were 1.4%, 1.2%, and 2.1%. The differences were not statistically significant. Nearly 75% of the patients had entry ejection fractions of at least 0.50. The annual mortality rates in patients in the surgical group in this subgroup with single-, double-, and triple-vessel disease were 0.8%, 0.8%, and 1.2% and corresponding rates in the medical group were 1.1%, 0.6%, and 1.2%. The annual rate of bypass surgery in patients who were initially assigned to receive medical treatment was 4.7%. The excellent survival rates observed both in CASS patients assigned to receive medical and those assigned to receive surgical therapy and the similarity of survival rates in the two groups of patients in this randomized trial lead to the conclusion that patients similar to those enrolled in this trial can safely defer bypass surgery until symptoms worsen to the point that surgical palliation is required.", 
    "37": "This report describes the clinical and electrophysiologic characteristics of 30 patients without myocardial disease who had ventricular tachycardia with the morphologic characteristics of left bundle branch block and inferior axis. The tachycardias were nonsustained in 24 patients, sustained (greater than 30 sec) in six patients, and provocable by exercise in 14 of 23 patients undergoing a standard Bruce protocol. Ventricular tachycardia was induced during electrophysiologic study in 22 of 30 patients. Programmed stimulation induced tachycardia in 10 of 30 patients, most frequently by rapid atrial or ventricular pacing. Isoproterenol infusion facilitated tachycardia induction in 13 of 23 patients. Endocardial activation mapping, performed in 10 patients, confirmed that earliest ventricular activation during tachycardia occurred at the right ventricular outflow tract on the interventricular septum. These tachycardias were unique in their responsiveness to a wide variety of antiarrhythmic drugs, including type I drugs and propranolol. During a mean follow-up of 30 months, no patient has died or experienced cardiac arrest. Two patients appear to be in spontaneous remission, and no patient has developed additional signs of cardiac disease.",

The role of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins as the cause of hyperthyroidism, goiter and exophthalmos in Graves' disease is analytically considered. Genetic factors are also discussed. The Authors report some personal clinical observations emphasizing the polymorphic clinical course of the infantile Graves' disease. The diagnostic procedures and the therapeutical management are successively analyzed. Pathogenesis and clinical picture of neonatal thyrotoxicosis and Plummer's disease, two not frequent conditions, are finally examined.", 
    "39": "Milrinone (Win 47203) is a dipyridine related to amrinone, which is about 20-50 times as effective as amrinone when assayed on cardiac contractility. In dog heart-lung preparations, milrinone in a concentration of 0.25-0.5 microM produced a near maximal positive inotropic effect on a variety of acute heart failures. This dosage produced a minimal increase in heart rate and reduced the PR interval. Large doses of milrinone did not produce cardiac irregularities and in Nifedipine heart failure with ventricular irregularities, it eliminated these irregularities. Papaverine-induced heart failure was resistant to ouabain, epinephrine and milrinone therapy. In the presence of positive inotropic amounts of papaverine or theophylline, a pentobarbital heart failure was superimposed. This heart failure responded poorly to milrinone, although it responded to both the addition of epinephrine and ouabain. It is thus possible that milrinone, papaverine and theophylline have closely related sites of action.", 
    "40": "Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Db-cAMP)- and dibutyryl cyclic GMP (Db-cGMP)-induced hyperthermia in rabbits. Central administration of 4-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-pyrrolidone (ZK 62711), a selective inhibitor of cAMP phosphodiesterase, only accentuated the hyperthermia due to Db-cAMP whereas a selective inhibitor of cGMP phosphodiesterase, 2-O-proproxyphenyl-8-azapurin-6-one (M and B 22948), only potentiated the hyperthermia caused by Db-cGMP. The hyperthermia due to Db-cAMP and Db-cGMP was not mediated through prostaglandins (PG). In contrast, central administration of an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, or a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, sotalol, only attenuated the hyperthermic response to Db-cAMP while a cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, specifically antagonized Db-cGMP-induced hyperthermia. I.c.v. administration of a protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, did inhibit the hyperthermia due to Db-cAMP and Db-cGMP. Opiate antagonist, naloxone, did not antagonize Db-cAMP- and Db-cGMP-induced hyperthermia. These results suggest that a protein mediator is implicated in the induction of hyperthermia by Db-cAMP and Db-cGMP and that cAMP and cGMP may be involved through alpha/beta-adrenergic and cholinergic muscarinic receptors respectively in the central regulation of heat production/conservation in rabbits.", 
    "41": "The low affinity site in the Schild plot of (-)-propranolol as an antagonist of isoproterenol in the field stimulated rat vas deferens was absent after reserpinization or treatment with rauwolscine. The apparent dependence of intact catecholamine stores and functional alpha 2-adrenoreceptors for demonstration of the low affinity site for propranolol in this preparation suggests that the low affinity site reflects the ability of beta-adrenergic blockers to antagonize an action of isoproterenol upon presynaptic beta-receptors.", 
    "42": "Six healthy women participated in a study of the concentrations of propranolol achieved in plasma after insertion of the drug into the vagina. In four of the women the concentrations were also determined after administration by mouth. The area under the concentration curve for propranolol administered per vaginam was significantly greater than that after oral administration. There were small significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and forced expiratory volume in one second after vaginal administration but these did not cause any symptomatic side effects. The tolerability of the vagina to drugs and the safety of this form of treatment remain to be determined. Probably further studies of the contraceptive effects of propranolol should be conducted with the dextro isomer of the drug.", 
    "43": "The efficacy and tolerability of 80 mg propranolol tablets as a vaginal contraceptive were studied in 198 fertile women for 11 months. The calculated one year life table pregnancy rate was 3.4/100 women and the Pearl index was 3.9/100 women years. No major adverse effects were encountered. The findings suggested that propranolol is an effective vaginal contraceptive whose failure rate compares favourably with that of other methods of contraception. Further study of propranolol and similar compounds is warranted.", 
    "44": "The ability of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) as compared to norepinephrine (NE) to mobilize different Ca2+ pools was investigated in rabbit ear artery (REA). 5-HT appears to both mobilize intracellular Ca2+ and trigger transmembrane Ca2+ influx in this preparation. Although stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by 5-HT appears to be involved, the duration of 5-HT-induced cellular and extracellular Ca2+-dependent contractions outlasts the duration of those produced by equipotent concentrations of NE. Both cellular and extracellular Ca2+-dependent contractile responses produced by low but not high concentrations of 5-HT were significantly higher in arterial segments pretreated with 6-OH dopamine and in presence of desoxycorticosterone and propranolol while those produced by NE were unaffected. The duration of extracellular Ca2+-dependent 5-HT and NE-induced contractions was enhanced over the whole concentration range and in a similar manner. These findings as well as the results obtained with the receptor antagonists cyproheptadine and phentolamine could be interpreted as an indication that: (a) stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by 5-HT is only in part responsible for the contractile effects of 5-HT in REA; (b) additional mechanism(s) activated by 5-HT appear to modulate the duration of both cellular and extracellular Ca2+-dependent contractions and, (c) difference(s) in tissular handling of these amines do not appear to play a role in their different contractile effects.", 
    "45": "The chronic effect of propranolol on induced water intake and on the subfornical organ was studied. Propranolol reduced water intake postdehydration. It did not inhibit the increase in plasma renin activity due to dehydration or the dipsogenic response to angiotensin II. Propranolol decreased the subfornical organ large protrusion cells. This result suggests that propranolol impairs the thirst not related to angiotensin II. The subfornical organ changes may indicate that propranolol blocks a beta-adrenergic system originating in ependymal cells.", 
    "46": "Current knowledge concerning idiopathic prolapse of the mitral valve is illustrated. The histopathological cause is myxoid degeneration of the mitral cusps, which sometimes extends to the tendinous cords, the valve implant ring, and the apex of the papillary muscles. Primary damage to these structures, whose intactness is essential for correct closure of the ostium, causes protrusion of the ventricular cusps into the left atrium during ventricular systole (i.e. prolapse). The reason for this degeneration is not known. The high familial incidence of prolapse lends credit to the most widely held suggestion, namely a hereditary defect. The clinical progress is benign in the great majority of cases (\"crystallized\" form) and is often asymptomatic. Complications are possible, however, and must always be borne in mind. They include progressive and acute mitral insufficiency, infective endocarditis, arrhythmias, motor or sensitive neurological complications, and sudden death. Particular attention must be paid to the path to be followed to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Careful evaluation of some of the clinical signs arousing suspicion in the previous history and/or objective examination enable a diagnosis to be formed with relatively simple, non-invasive instrumental techniques, such as echocardiography and polycardiography, provided other forms of prolapse secondary to ischaemic heart disease, mitral endocarditis, etc. are excluded. \"Therapy is obviously necessary in the presence of complications; however, even in \"crystallized\" form, in the presence of subjective symptoms, tranquillizers and possibly beta-blockers may be necessary\".", 
    "47": "The use of captopril in pregnancy has not previously been reported. We describe a patient who presented in the third trimester of pregnancy with severe hypertension secondary to renal artery fibromuscular hyperplasia and who was successfully treated with captopril alone and in combination with labetalol and frusemide.", 
    "48": "The number of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors identified by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding decreases in a concentration-dependent manner during prolonged administration of isoproterenol. Loss of membrane beta-receptors is paralleled by the appearance of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding activity in the cytosol. This redistribution of receptors is prevented by colchicine and vinblastine but not lumicolchicine. Cardiac receptor desensitization is, therefore, dependent on microtubules and may be influenced by agents interfering with tubulin polymerization.", 
    "49": "To evaluate serotonin receptor kinetics in skeletal muscle, we synthesized and developed 2-[125I]iodolysergic acid diethylamide [( 125I]iodoLSD) as a high affinity, high specific activity probe of serotonergic receptor function. The kinetics of binding of this probe and the profile of agonist and antagonist displacement have been compared to results obtained using [125I] iodopindolol as a probe for beta-adrenergic receptor binding. [125I]IodoLSD was prepared by chloramine-T iodination and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Fluorescence, ultraviolet, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra as well as mass spectroscopy demonstrate that the iodinated compound is 2-iodoLSD. This probe bound in a concentration-dependent fashion to sarcolemma in a manner consistent with existence of a single population of specific receptors having a Kd of 1.46 nM and an abundancy of 47 fmol/mg of protein. Half-maximal binding of the probe occurred within 1.0 min and equilibrium binding was observed at 8.0 min. The apparent t 1/2 for the probe-receptor complex was 40 s; the Kd calculated from kinetic data was 1.69 nM. The IC50 for displacement of iodoLSD was 330 +/- 185 nM for methysergide, 757 +/- 309 nM for cyproheptadine, and 2,570 +/- 1,390 nM for serotonin. Adrenergic antagonists such as l-propranolol and oxprenolol also displaced [125I]iodoLSD, but did so with IC50 values of 17,800 +/- 5,100 and 23,300 +/- 5,500 nM, respectively. Using [125I]iodopindolol as a receptor probe, we found the order of potency for adrenergic antagonists to be l-propranolol greater than oxprenolol much much greater than practolol. Serotonergic antagonists, although effective in displacing [125I]iodopindolol, did so only at very high concentrations. These results are consistent with the existence of separate and discrete D-serotonergic and beta 2-adrenergic receptors in skeletal muscle and the finding that adrenergic agonists and antagonists may interact with low affinities with the serotonergic receptor, but that serotonergic agonists and antagonists interact poorly, if at all, with the beta 2-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "50": "The effects of beta-adrenergic drugs alone and in combination with alpha-adrenergic drugs on the stages of the sleep-waking cycle were studied in adult cats. Polygraphic sleep recordings of 16 h showed that prenalterol (20 and 40 mg/kg i.p.), a beta 1-adrenoceptor-stimulating drug increased paradoxical sleep (PS) in a dose-related manner during 4-12 h. Salbutamol (40 mg/kg), a beta 2-adrenoceptor-stimulating drug, decreased PS during the first 4 h. Metoprolol (10 and 50 mg/kg), a relatively selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug, increased drowsy waking during the first 4 h. The larger dose also tended to decrease PS. Already at the lower dose metoprolol partially antagonized the PS increase produced by prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking drug. Propranolol (5 mg/kg), a beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug, which alone decreases PS, antagonized the PS increase induced by phentolamine, an alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking drug. Atenolol (5 mg/kg), a poorly lipid-soluble beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, failed to counteract phentolamine in increasing PS. Metoprolol (10 and 50 mg/kg) and propranolol (5 mg/kg) clearly potentiated the increase in drowsy waking and decrease in deep slow wave sleep and PS induced by clonidine (0.01 mg/kg), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor-stimulating drug. The results support the involvement of beta-adrenoceptors in the regulation of the sleep-waking cycle. A high level of beta-adrenergic activity may facilitate the production of PS. A low level of beta-adrenergic activity, especially in combination with a high level of alpha 2-adrenergic activity, may facilitate the production of drowsy waking. Central alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors may mediate opposite functions in the regulation of PS.", 
    "51": "An assessment was made of the efficacy of Sotalol, a beta1 selective beta blocker, in the management of essential arterial hypertension. A single 160 mg dose per diem was administered per os to 34 patients over a period of 14 weeks. Arterial pressure and heart rate were checked periodically. In addition, SAP, DAP and heart rate were evaluated before and during the third week of treatment in 8 subjects under maximum ergometric test conditions. Excellent tolerance was observed. Under basal conditions, all subjects displayed good reduction of SAP and DAP. This was highly significant. During exercise, it was less evident, and the results were only significant for low work loads. It is nevertheless felt that the simple dose protocol of the drug, its good tolerance and its effectiveness under basal conditions suggest that more extensive ergometric studies should be conducted.", 
    "52": "There are several mechanisms by which homeothermic animals increase heat production, including shivering, sympathetic nervous system activation and stimulation of thyroid hormone secretion. Studies in rats have shown that increased sympathetic activity causes increased heat production in brown adipose tissue (BAT) after cold exposure or food ingestion. Acute cold exposure also increases circulating thyroid hormones which in turn stimulate cellular metabolism through induction of various enzymes. Most metabolic effects of thyroxine (T4) are thought to be due to the triiodothyronine (T3) which is produced from T4 by a process of 5' monodeiodination. There are two enzymes responsible for this reaction: type I, or propylthiouracil (PTU)-sensitive iodothyronine deiodinase (5'D-I), which is reduced in hypothyroidism, stimulated in hyperthyroidism and probably provides most of the circulating T3 in the adult rat. Type II 5'-deiodinase (5'D-II) is characteristic of brain and pituitary, is increased by thyroidectomy, is not inhibited by PTU and provides 50-80% of the intracellular T3 in these two tissues. Recently, 5'D-II activity was identified in interscapular BAT. As the sympathetic nervous system influences the metabolic activation of BAT, we have studied the effects of noradrenaline and acute cold exposure on BAT 5'D-II. We report here that both noradrenaline and cold exposure increase BAT 5'D-II through alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, whereas depletion of catecholamines with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (MPT) prevents the effect of cold but not that of noradrenaline. These results suggest that the sympathetic nervous system may increase T3 production in rats by stimulating BAT 5'D-II. By increasing metabolic rate, this rise in T3 would enhance the thermogenic response to sympathetic stimulation.", 
    "53": "Long-term therapy with oral labetalol, an alpha- and beta-blocking agent, has been shown to effectively lower blood pressure and heart rate without decreasing cardiac output. We examined the hemodynamic effects of the acute intravenous administration of labetalol in nine hypertensive patients. Labetalol (0.6 +/- 0.1 mg/kg) promptly reduced arterial pressure, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance without change in stroke volume. Heart rate responses to passive tilt and the Valsalva maneuver were significantly blunted. With isometric exercise, heart rate and mean arterial pressure increased significantly during labetalol therapy but less than in the pre-labetalol phase. In eight patients oral labetalol therapy was continued for six weeks (mean dose 1,050 +/- 105 mg/day), and hemodynamic evaluation was repeated. During oral labetalol therapy, decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate were sustained. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced in five of the eight patients. Hemodynamic responses to tilt, Valsalva maneuver, and handgrip were similar to those during intravenous administration. Coronary blood flow decreased, but coronary as well as pulmonary vascular resistances were unchanged. These data show the efficacy of intravenously administered labetalol in lowering blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance promptly. With long-term oral therapy, decreases in blood pressure are sustained. Labetalol does not appear to have significant effects on pulmonary or coronary vascular resistances.", 
    "54": "The acute blood pressure lowering effect of intravenous labetalol (0.2 to 0.8 mg/kg) was studied in 11 patients with severe hypertension. The blood pressure was reduced by 22 percent partly due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance (-14 percent) and partly due to a reduction in cardiac output (-10 percent). Stroke volume was unchanged. Fifteen patients with moderate essential hypertension were studied at rest and during exercise before and after one and six years of labetalol therapy. Blood pressure was reduced approximately 22 percent at rest as well as during exercise, mainly due to a reduction in total peripheral resistance. However, after one year, cardiac index was reduced 10 to 14 percent (p less than 0.01) at rest (sitting) and during exercise due to a reduction in heart rate not compensated for by an increase in stroke volume. During the next five years, blood pressure control was maintained, but cardiac index tended to increase and was not significantly reduced in any situation six years after treatment was started. Total peripheral resistance decreased significantly and was reduced 15 to 20 percent (p less than 0.01) after six years. Stroke index increased about 10 to 15 percent (p less than 0.01). These alterations are the opposite of what is seen in untreated hypertensive patients restudied after 10 and 17 years. The normalization of central hemodynamics could reflect the regression of structural changes in the heart and in the resistance vessels.", 
    "55": "Eighty-one severely hypertensive patients were enrolled in a multicenter, double-blind, parallel group study evaluating the efficacy and safety of labetalol alone or in combination with furosemide versus methyldopa in combination with furosemide. A one day to four week placebo lead-in phase was followed by a one- to six-week titration period and a one-year maintenance period. Treatment with labetalol alone or in combination with furosemide, as well as methyldopa plus furosemide, was associated with significant reductions in supine and standing blood pressure levels. Moreover, after six months and one year of treatment, respectively, labetalol caused a significantly (p less than 0.05) greater reduction in the systolic blood pressure than the methyldopa regimen. The antihypertensive effect of labetalol was associated with small, yet significant reductions in heart rate; in contrast, resting tachycardia was observed in methyldopa-treated patients. Side effect profiles of the two treatments were different, with nausea being the most commonly reported side effect during labetalol therapy, and asthenia, somnolence, and dry mouth during methyldopa therapy. Overall, 33 of 65 (53 percent) labetalol-treated and 28 of 60 (47 percent) methyldopa-treated patients had at least a good response (that is, standing diastolic blood pressure 90 to 94 mm Hg) to therapy, including 26 (40 percent) and 22 (37 percent) patients, respectively, who had standing diastolic blood pressure levels of less than 90 mm Hg. Thus, labetalol is a potentially safe and effective agent in the long-term management of the patient with severe hypertension.", 
    "56": "Labetalol, a new alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, was administered to 57 patients with essential hypertension whose standing diastolic blood pressure was 105 to 120 mm Hg after three and four weeks of placebo therapy and greater than 90 mm Hg after three to four weeks of therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg twice a day. Patients were then randomly assigned on a double-blind basis to receive either labetalol, 100 mg twice a day, or placebo combined with hydrochlorothiazide. Thereafter, the dose of labetalol was titrated weekly in both groups to a maximum of 400 mg twice a day to achieve a standing diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg that was also decreased from the hydrochlorothiazide baseline by 10 mm Hg or more (therapeutic goal). Labetalol was abruptly discontinued after four weeks of treatment and patients were given hydrochlorothiazide alone for two additional weeks. After one week of labetalol therapy, 100 mg twice a day (added to hydrochlorothiazide), there was a significantly greater reduction in supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure (6/5 mm Hg, p less than 0.04/less than 0.03) and standing blood pressure (9/7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01/less than 0.01) than with placebo therapy (3/0.5 and 3/1 mm Hg, respectively). The blood pressure reduction in the labetalol-treated group was associated with a 4 and 5 beats per minute reduction in the supine and standing heart rates, respectively. The median labetalol dose required to achieve the standing diastolic blood pressure goal was 400 mg twice a day. After four weeks of labetalol treatment, the mean reduction in blood pressure from the hydrochlorothiazide baseline was 12/13 mm Hg (p less than 0.01/0.01) in the standing position and 8/8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01/0.01) in the supine position. These blood pressure reductions were accompanied by a mean reduction in heart rate of 7 beats per minute. The most frequently reported complaints other than thiazide-induced nocturia included dizziness, fatigue, nausea, rash, and/or pruritus. Most of these complaints were reported at a similar incidence while patients were receiving placebo or hydrochlorothiazide alone as when receiving labetalol with hydrochlorothiazide. After abrupt withdrawal of labetalol, no evidence of rebound hypertension was observed. Labetalol is a safe and effective step II drug when added to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of patients with moderate to moderately severe hypertension.", 
    "57": "The long-term efficacy and safety of labetalol, an antihypertensive agent with combined beta- and alpha-blocking activity, were evaluated alone (number = 193) and in combination with a diuretic (number = 144) in an open-label multicenter trial of 337 hypertensive patients aged 21 to 75 years, including initially 205 (61 percent) men and 219 (65 percent) Caucasians. There were 219 (65 percent) mild, 85 (25 percent) moderate, and 33 (10 percent) severe hypertensive patients. Labetalol (100 to 1,200 mg twice a day) alone or in combination with a diuretic reduced the mean standing blood pressure by 13/11 and 25/16 mm Hg to 135/88 and 130/91 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.01), and supine blood pressure by 6/7 and 18/13 mm Hg to 141/86 and 138/90 mm Hg (p less than 0.01), respectively. Blood pressure reductions observed at one month were maintained after one year; 206 (62 percent) patients had 10 mm Hg or greater reductions and 184 (56 percent) patients were maintained at diastolic blood pressures less than 90 mm Hg. Most frequently reported drug-related side effects included fatigue (14 percent), dizziness (12 percent), nausea (11 percent), nasal stuffiness (8 percent), headache (4 percent), and male sexual dysfunction (14 percent). Side effects were generally of mild to moderate intensity and often transient. In addition, in 27 (8 percent) patients reversible asymptomatic transaminase elevations to greater than twice normal developed at some time during the study. In 13 (4 percent) patients these alterations resolved during continued labetalol therapy, but in five (2 percent) patients these marked elevations led to discontinuation of the drug. A total of 32 (9.5 percent) patients were terminated prematurely due to side effects (most commonly genitourinary or gastrointestinal) possibly attributable to the drug. These findings indicate that labetalol with or without a diuretic is a potentially effective, safe, and relatively well-tolerated long-term antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "58": "The antihypertensive effects of oral labetalol, a new alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and metoprolol, a relatively beta1 selective adrenergic blocker, were evaluated in 91 patients with mild to moderate hypertension (standing diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 115 mm Hg) in a double-blind parallel group multicenter clinical trial. The effects of the two drugs on plasma lipids and lipoprotein fractions were also assessed. Following a four-week placebo phase, 44 patients were randomized to receive labetalol and 47 metoprolol. During a four-week titration phase, the labetalol dose was increased from 100 mg twice daily to a maximum of 600 mg twice daily to achieve a standing diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg that was decreased by 10 mm Hg or more. Metoprolol was titrated from 50 mg to 200 mg twice daily. An eight-week maintenance period followed during which hydrochlorothiazide could be added. At the end of the maintenance phase, the doses of labetalol and metoprolol were tapered over a two to four day period after which patients received a placebo for one week. Blood pressure in the supine and standing position was measured at each visit. Labetalol and metoprolol both significantly (p less than 0.01) lowered the supine and standing blood pressure from baseline with no significant difference found between the two treatment groups. Both drugs lowered the heart rate; however, the rate-lowering effect was significantly greater with metoprolol (p less than 0.01). There were no significant effects of either drug on plasma lipids or lipoprotein fractions. Fatigue was the most frequently reported complaint with both drugs. Dizziness, dyspepsia, and nausea were more common with labetalol; bradycardia was more common with metoprolol. There was no blood pressure \"overshoot\" after withdrawing drug treatment; however, a heart rate \"overshoot\" was seen after metoprolol was tapered off and stopped. Labetalol is as safe and effective as metoprolol in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "59": "The antihypertensive effects of oral labetalol compared with placebo were evaluated in 74 mildly hypertensive patients (standing diastolic blood pressure 95 to 110 mm Hg) in a bicentric double-blind parallel group study. Following a four-week placebo phase, 36 patients were randomly assigned to receive labetalol and 38 to receive placebo. A five-week titration phase followed during which the dose of labetalol was increased weekly from 100 mg twice a day to 600 mg twice a day to achieve a standing diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg and decreased 10 mm Hg or more from baseline. A matching number of placebo capsules for each dose of labetalol was dispensed for blinding purposes. Patients then entered a two-month maintenance phase. A thiazide diuretic could be added when the standing diastolic blood pressure was 100 mm Hg or greater at the highest dose of the study drug. At the end of this phase, the administration of labetalol (or placebo) was abruptly discontinued and patients were given the same number of placebo capsules twice a day taken during maintenance. Blood pressure and heart rate in the supine and standing position were measured eight to 10 hours after a dose at each visit. This study demonstrated that labetalol (median daily doses of 600 mg) was significantly more effective than placebo (p less than 0.05) in lowering the supine and standing blood pressures. Significantly more (p less than 0.001) placebo-treated patients than labetalol-treated patients (six versus 20) required the addition of a thiazide diuretic. Control of hypertension (that is, standing diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) was achieved in significantly (p less than 0.001) more labetalol-treated patients than placebo-treated patients at the monotherapy endpoint (26 of 36; 72 percent versus six of 38; 16 percent). Blood pressure overshoot did not occur when labetalol was abruptly discontinued. Not one labetalol-treated patient discontinued the study because of adverse experiences. Labetalol is a safe and effective treatment for patients with mild hypertension.", 
    "60": "This was an open-label, two-phase crossover study of labetalol in 11 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. A two- to four-week outpatient placebo phase was followed by a three-day inpatient placebo period. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive either labetalol, 200 mg, as a single dose and three times a day for three days and, on the final day, another single dose or a similar sequence with 300 mg as the single dose and multiple twice a day treatment. A two-week placebo outpatient period was followed by the second phase of the study in which the treatment regimen was reversed for the two groups. Blood samples for the determination of free and conjugated labetalol plasma levels were collected, and blood pressures and heart rate were recorded sequentially for 24 hours after the first and last dose of labetalol, and during the multiple dose treatment period before and two hours after each dose as well as four times daily with the patient supine and upright. Of the 11 patients analyzed, five were men and six were women, ranging in age from 33 to 62 years. Labetalol (200 mg and 300 mg) was rapidly absorbed with peak concentrations achieved in approximately one hour. The pharmacokinetic data best fit a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first order absorption. At steady state, the absorption, distribution, and elimination kinetics were similar for both dosage regimens with elimination half life of 7.65 and 7.92 hours for the 200 mg three times a day and 300 mg twice a day regimens, respectively. During the multiple dosing period average steady-state plasma drug concentrations were 0.149 mg/ml and 0.145 mg/ml for the 300 mg twice a day and 200 mg three times a day regimens, respectively. Approximately 12 percent of total plasma labetalol was free drug. The balance was conjugated. The first dose of 200 mg or 300 mg of labetalol significantly (p less than 0.01) lowered standing and supine mean blood pressure over a period of eight to 12 hours, respectively, with peak effects occurring at two (standing) and four (supine) hours. A significant reduction (p less than 0.01) in supine mean blood pressure was present 24 hours after the initial dose of 300 mg. At steady state the antihypertensive effects of the 200 mg three times a day and the 300 mg twice a day dosage regimens were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "61": "Labetalol is a new adrenergic antagonist with both alpha- and beta-blocking effects. The effects of labetalol and hydrochlorothiazide on the hypertension and ventilatory function of patients with both hypertension and mild reversible chronic pulmonary disease were compared. In this double-blind study, 20 patients were randomly allocated to receive increasing doses of labetalol (100 to 400 mg three times a day) or hydrochlorothiazide (25 to 50 mg three times a day) over a four-week treatment period. Patients returned at weekly intervals for spirometry baseline, two hours after receiving the medication for the following week, and five minutes after an exercise test. Each treatment reduced the blood pressure significantly and to a comparable degree. There was no significant decrease in ventilatory function two hours after administration of the drug at any visit for either drug. Ventilatory function did not deteriorate significantly following exercise with either drug. With labetalol there was a progressive statistically significant decline in baseline forced expiratory volume in one second from 1,860 +/- 190 ml to 1,685 +/- 190 ml during the four-week study period, although no patient became symptomatic from shortness of breath. We conclude that labetalol is an effective antihypertensive agent that does not adversely effect ventilatory function immediately, but that may lead to a decline in ventilatory function when administered long-term.", 
    "62": "Labetalol represents the culmination of an effort to enhance the antihypertensive efficacy and to improve the hemodynamic profile of beta-adrenoceptor blockers by incorporating an additional anti-hypertensive action, that is, alpha blockade, into its pharmacologic mechanism. Reviewed here are the major aspects of the animal pharmacology of labetalol. The compound blocks beta1 and beta2-adrenoceptors nonselectively. Its blockade of alpha receptors is selective and directed at the alpha1 subset. Labetalol also dilates blood vessels independently of these mechanisms. This action is mediated by activation of vascular beta2 adrenoceptors. Thus, labetalol acts as a partial agonist on vascular smooth muscle. However, it differs markedly from other beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in that its agonism is directed specifically at beta2 receptors. Labetalol lowers blood pressure in a variety of animal models of hypertension. Unlike pure beta blockers, the compound reduces peripheral vascular resistance. On the basis of this profile, it is proposed that labetalol lowers blood pressure in human subjects by three independent mechanisms: (1) beta blockade, (2) alpha blockade, and (3) direct vasodilatation.", 
    "63": "The antihypertensive effects of intravenous labetalol were evaluated in 59 patients with hypertensive crises or severe hypertension in need of rapid lowering of blood pressure in a multicenter study. Patients appearing with a supine diastolic blood pressure 125 mm Hg or greater, or a supine systolic blood pressure of more than 200 mm Hg received an initial mini-bolus injection (20 mg) of labetalol. This was followed by repeated incremental doses of 20 to 80 mg given at 10 minute intervals to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg or decrease 30 mm Hg or greater, or a satisfactory decrease in systolic blood pressure. Patients were stratified into those who had taken antihypertensive medication within 24 hours and those who had not. The initial mini-bolus injection caused rapid but not abrupt reduction in blood pressure; the baseline mean blood pressure decreased 23/14 mm Hg. Further injections were needed in the majority of patients (mean: 197 mg). The blood pressure reduction after the last dose of labetalol was 55/33 mm Hg. In pretreated patients and in those who had no medication for 24 hours prior to the intravenous labetalol, the response was similar. Heart rate decreased 10 beats per minute in the total population. In patients pretreated with beta-adrenergic blockers, blood pressure response was similar to that in the total group (59/35 versus 55/33 mm Hg), but heart rate remained essentially unchanged. The dose required to achieve the therapeutic effect was less in pretreated patients than in untreated patients, but the duration of action was shorter. No serious adverse effects were encountered even in patients with concomitant diagnoses of acute left ventricular failure, myocardial infarction, stable congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris, acute stroke, transient ischemic attack or encephalopathy. Labetalol is a safe and effective treatment for a rapid blood pressure reduction in hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "64": "The beta-adrenergic receptor blocking drugs have been in use for the treatment of hypertension for almost two decades. Although the mechanism of their antihypertensive action still is not precisely known, they have become an established major class of therapy for the disease. Most agents produce an immediate reduction in heart rate and cardiac output, later followed by a reduction in pressure. The exceptions include: those agents that possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and produce little reduction in heart rate and output; and labetalol, an agent that reduces pressure immediately (associated with the cardiac effects) because it possesses alpha- as well as beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects. Just because a beta-blocking drug reduces cardiac output significantly, it does not follow that renal blood flow will decrease; this depends upon the number and affinity of receptors in the renal circulation. Most beta blockers (including labetalol) reduce renal vascular resistance in patients with uncomplicated hypertension. Other actions of this class of adrenoceptor blocking agents are discussed. As we learn more of the physiologic effects of adrenoceptor blocking agents, there is no doubt that we shall gain more insight into the underlying mechanisms of hypertensive diseases as well as their pharmacologic properties.", 
    "65": "Antihypertensive agents possess many properties that could cause alterations in renal function. These are: alterations in systemic hemodynamics, changes in the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, direct intrarenal effects, and alterations in salt and water metabolism. This article reviews the antihypertensive agents in general usage and major points are made concerning potential deleterious effects of methyldopa and nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on renal function. In particular, recent data are shown concerning the effects of labetalol on renal function indicating the absence of decrements in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in patients with normal renal function and in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. A possible decrease in these parameters in patients with severe renal insufficiency is presented and discussed.", 
    "66": "Unanesthetized, chronically instrumented, nonpregnant sheep were studied in periods of progressive blood withdrawal, hypovolemic shock, blood reinfusion, and recovery. Hemodynamic responses were recorded during experiments with an intact beta-adrenergic system (saline solution), beta-adrenergic blockage (propranolol), and beta-adrenergic stimulation (isoxsuprine). With an intact beta-adrenergic system, stepwise bleeding produced a progressive decrease in arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac output and an increase in systemic vascular resistance; heart rate increased initially but fell when hypovolemia became severe. All circulatory parameters returned toward control valves during blood reinfusion and recovery. In animals deprived of beta-adrenergic control, the hemodynamic response to progressive hypovolemia and blood reinfusion was not greatly different from that of control animals, despite abolition of tachycardia. During beta-adrenergic stimulation, arterial pressure and cardiac output fell more rapidly than in control and tachycardia was relatively small; cardiac output and stroke volume rebounded strikingly during reinfusion and recovery. These results support findings of others that the role of the beta-adrenergic system is minor during hypovolemia. When pharmacologically activated, it might play a significant role in the posthypovolemia compensatory mechanisms.", 
    "67": "In human large pial arteries, dopamine-induced relaxations appear to be mediated via dopaminergic receptors, and predominate over contractions mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "68": "In anaesthetized cats, atenolol (3 mg X kg-1 i.v.) produced an immediate reduction in blood pressure, heart rate and aortic nerve discharge. However, 30 min and 60 min after atenolol there was a shift to the left of the curve relating aortic nerve discharge to mean arterial blood pressure indicating a delayed resetting of the baroreceptors. There was no evidence that atenolol altered the sensitivity of the baroreceptors.", 
    "69": "ASL-8052, a novel ultra-short acting beta receptor blocking agent, was infused i.v. and its cardiovascular effects were investigated in conscious, as well as anesthetized rabbits. On i.v. infusion, its effects reached a steady state within 6 min and on termination of infusion, complete recovery occurred within 20 min. In conscious rabbits it inhibited isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and hypotension. There was more pronounced inhibition of the cardioaccelerator effects of isoproterenol than its hypotensive effects. ASL-8052 produced dose dependent bradycardia in conscious rabbits which was more marked in rabbits pretreated with atropine methyl nitrate. When infused in larger doses, a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure was seen in conscious as well as anesthetized rabbits. This hypotensive effect was not blocked by prior beta receptor blockade with propranolol. ASL-8052-induced hypotension was found to be due to a significant decrease in total peripheral resistance. It also produced vasodilation in the mesenteric vascular bed. The role of the liver in the clearance of ASL-8052 was investigated. When infused into the portal vein, the response to ASL-8052 was markedly attenuated, while an equivalent dose infused into the femoral vein produced a significant level of beta receptor blockade. These results suggest that ASL-8052 is an ultra-short acting beta receptor blocking agent with vasodilator effects in rabbits. While the liver may play a significant role in the clearance of ASL-8052 from circulation, the role of extra-hepatic mechanisms in the rapid decay of its pharmacological effects remains to be investigated.", 
    "70": "25 patients with essential arterial hypertension were treated with single daily doses of 400 g acebutolol administered for EIGHT weeks in outpatients' departments. The drug proved to be extremely effective in reducing PAS and PAD values in both lying and standing positions. No undesirable side effects were observed except in one case where cardiac insufficiency was controlled by digitalis. It can therefore be concluded that acebutolol is a beta-adrenolytic drug which is reliably effective in the treatment of essential arterial hypertension, well tolerated and easily administered."
