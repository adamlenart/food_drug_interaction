    "0": "Endogenous catecholamines released during myocardial ischemia have been considered both to aggravate cell injury and exacerbate arrhythmias and to exert a protective action on the post-ischemic contractile function. The present work was addressed to look for evidence to explain this controversy. The effects of cardiac catecholamine depletion and of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor (AR) blockade on the post-ischemic contractile dysfunction, as well as its possible relationship with cardiac oxidative stress, were studied in isolated and perfused rat hearts submitted to 20 min of ischemia and 30 min of reperfusion (stunning). Catecholamine depletion improves the contractile recovery in the stunned heart. This mechanical effect was associated with decreased levels of lipid peroxidation. A similar enhancement of the contractile function during reperfusion was detected after the simultaneous blockade of alpha 1- and beta-ARs with prazosin plus propranolol. To ascertain which specific AR pathway was involved in the effects of catecholamines on the stunned heart, selective AR blockers, prazosin (alpha 1-blocker), atenolol (beta 1-blocker), ICI 118,551 (beta 2-blocker) and selective inhibitors of Gi-PI3K pathway (pertussis toxin and wortmannin) were alternatively combined. The results indicate that catecholamines released during ischemia exert a dual action on the contractile behavior of the stunned heart: a deleterious effect, related to the activation of the beta 2-AR-Gi-PI3K-pathway, which was counteracted by a beneficial effect, triggered by the stimulation of alpha 1-AR. Neither the depression nor the enhancement of the post-ischemic contractile recovery were related with the increase in ROS formation induced by endogenous catecholamines.", 
    "1": "We investigated effects of chronic propranolol treatment on the secretory response of rat testicular interstitial cells (testosterone secretion) to subsequent in vitro stimulation with activators of protein kinase-C (PK-C) (L-propranolol, phorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate (PDBu), LHRH) or activators of protein kinase A (PK-A), (hCG or dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP)). We determined [3H]PDBu binding and PK-C activity in these cells. Treatment of rats with propranolol (Inderal 500 mg/L of water for 5 weeks) reduced by 48%, 50% and 29% the L-propranolol-, LHRH- or PDBu-induced testosterone secretion, respectively, when compared to cells from controls. This desensitization in testosterone secretion in vitro was also present when the testicular interstitial cells were stimulated with hCG or dbcAMP (secretion decreased by 65%/57%, respectively, when compared to cells from control rats). Challenging the cells originated from rats that received propranolol chronically with the addition in vitro of propranolol resulted in an additional reduction of the hCG/dbcAMP-stimulated testosterone secretion. Chronic propranolol-induced desensitization was not associated with a loss in [3H]PDBu binding or a decrease in PK-C activity. Chronic propranolol-induced desensitization can be uncoupled from down-regulation of protein kinase C. The effector responsible for the desensitization could be distal to the protein kinase C and protein kinase A.", 
    "2": "This study assessed the effects of short-term adrenoceptor blockade on plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in patients with heart failure, and the ability of adrenoceptor stimulation to modulate matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) promoter activity in vitro. Patients with heart failure received standard therapy or standard therapy plus carvedilol. Plasma MMP activity was determined by zymography and tissue inhibitor (TIMP-1) expression was measured by immunoblotting. MMP-9 promoter activity was assessed in transfected ECV304 cells following exposure to isoprenaline or phenylephrine in the absence or presence of either propranolol or prazosin. In patients with heart failure, carvedilol attenuated the increase in proMMP-9 activity observed at 4 and 12 weeks in non-beta-blocker-treated patients (44.0 +/- 4.9 AU versus 60.8 +/- 6.7 AU; P < 0.05). Although TIMP-1 expression was unaltered, the MMP-9:TIMP-1 ratio was lower in those receiving carvedilol at 4 and 12 weeks (0.54 +/- 0.07 versus 1.04 +/- 0.17; P < 0.05). Isoprenaline transiently increased MMP-9 promoter activity after 4 h exposure (80.6 +/- 14.8-fold; P < 0.001) before returning to baseline. The response to isoprenaline was prevented by propranolol (P < 0.01). Phenylephrine caused a biphasic increase in MMP-9 promoter activity, with the greatest increase occurring at 24 h (23 +/- 3.7-fold) compared to baseline. This response was unaffected by co-incubation with prazosin. In conclusion, treatment with a mixed alpha1/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist attenuates MMP activity and tips the degradative balance to a less degradative phenotype in heart failure patients. Furthermore, adrenoceptor stimulation increases MMP-9 promoter activity, which is inhibited by beta- but not alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. Therefore, mixed adrenoceptor blockade may reduce remodeling in heart failure as a direct consequence of a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated reduction in MMP-9 transcription.",

    "5": "Bradycardias are caused by a failure of the sinus node to generate normal impulses or due to a defect in cardiac conduction that in turn causes a delay or failure of impulse propagation. During sleep, the heart rate may decrease to 30 beats per minute (bpm) with episodes of sinoatrial block, junctional rhythms and first and second degree atrioventricular block that occur often enough (particularly in trained athletes) to be considered normal variants. However, treatment is required if symptoms of dizziness, confusion, fatigue Stokes-Adams attacks or heart failure occur. Sinus node dysfunction or 'sick sinus syndrome' is usually caused by intrinsic nodal disease and may present with episodes of tachycardia and bradycardia (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). Treatment usually requires a permanent pacemaker. Atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbances are characterised by a delay or failure of the atrial impulse to be conducted through the AV conducting system. If the escape rhythm is unstable the patient also requires a pacemaker. In the critically ill patient tachycardias are more often encountered than bradycardias. However, the intensivist should be familiar and skilled in the management of complete heart block and asystole, correcting the underlying defect (drug toxicity, hyperkalaemia, etc), while using catecholamines, atropine aminophylline and a temporary pacemaker for initial resuscitation.", 
    "6": "Bradycardias are uncommon in the critically ill patient and often are caused by an underlying disorder (e.g. hyperkalaemia, calcium channel blocker toxicity, beta adrenergic receptor blocker toxicity, etc). However, post cardiac bypass and acute myocardial infarction may cause cardiac conduction defects that may require urgent resuscitation with a temporary pacemaker.",

Opportunities exist for health care professionals to improve the management of residents with HF through appropriate drug therapy management.", 
    "12": "Heart diseases are the leading cause of death and morbidity in western countries and among them acute coronary artery diseases result to be the major contributor. During the last few decades a lot of energy has been mostly applied to the acute phase of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS), where cardiac events concentrate. In fact a timely risk stratification along with an early aggressive invasive strategy and very powerful antithrombotic treatment have profoundly improved the in-hospital prognosis of such patients. Such a strong emphasis on the acute phase of ACS could have limited the interest in the equally important post-discharge therapies. However, several studies have demonstrated that different preventive treatments (aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and clopidogrel) could substantially reduce the long-term mortality and morbidity of such patients. Therefore, current guidelines emphasize the role of aggressive secondary preventive treatments after ACS. However, a strong discrepancy between the indications of the guidelines and their application in the real world arises day by day. Such a discrepancy could be due to errors of omission or therapeutic paradoxes. Since patients with ACS are a subgroup of subjects where secondary preventive measures could be useful and cost-effective, cardiologists should not limit their attention to the acute phase of the disease but should eagerly concentrate their efforts on an aggressive secondary preventive treatment as well. Pursuing such a task could extend and magnify the benefits obtained with acute treatment of ACS and significantly improve the outcomes of such patients. Therefore, the role of the Scientific Societies is to improve the application of guidelines and the utilization of all evidence-based treatments even in such post-discharge phase.",

In all treated groups a significant increase of plasma BuChE activity was obtained after 6 weeks of either OXP (46 %), or GL (36 %) treatment, or of their concurrent application (24 %). After 12 weeks of treatment, the increase in enzyme activity was significant only in the OXP group. The BuChE activity in the liver was increased (between 3-25 %) in all treated groups except in one during 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. These effects of either OXP or GL, or their combination on BuChE activity in liver suggest their stimulating effects on enzyme synthesis. The changes of total plasma cholesterol in all groups were insignificant. On the other hand, HDL-cholesterol was significantly decreased in all treated groups. After 6 weeks of treatment, GL, OXP, or their combination caused a decrease in plasma HDL cholesterol by 19, 50 or 22 % respectively, when compared with the control group. After 12 weeks of GL, OXP, or GL+OXP administration, HDL-cholesterol plasma levels in treated groups were 32, 25 and 22 % lower than in the control group. Treatment with GL, OXP, or GL+OXP during 6 weeks had no significant effect on triglycerides level. However, after 12 weeks of GL, OXP, or GL+OXP administration, the triglycerides levels were significantly increased (9, 47 and 36 %) when compared with the control group. These results showed that the increase in BuChE activity might be the first sign of altered triglyceride and lipoprotein metabolism.",

The descending segment stops shortening during the rapid filling phase of fast descent of ventricular pressure, but the ascending segment shortening continues for 92+/-33 ms, so that active shortening continues during the period of isovolumetric relaxation. During the rapid filling phase, dopamine decreased the interval between completion of endocardial and termination of epicardial contraction from 92+/-20 to 33+/-8 ms. Conversely propranolol delayed the start of epicardial shortening from 82+/-23 to 121+/-20 ms, and prolonged the duration of endocardial contraction, causing a closer (21+/-5 ms vs 92+/-20 ms) interval between termination of contraction of endocardial and epicardial fibers. The resultant slope of the rapid descent of the left ventricular pressure curve became prolonged.",

Several relatively small randomised trials have compared calcium channel blockers with beta-agonists and the meta-analyses of these studies have demonstrated superior or comparable efficacy and a superior adverse events profile. The safety of calcium channel blockers in pregnancy has not been rigorously evaluated and they remain unlicensed for use as tocolytics. Indeed, there is concern following a number of recent case studies that have reported serious adverse events after the administration of a calcium channel blocker as a tocolytic. In this article all these recently reported cases are critically reviewed and the pros and cons of tocolytic treatment options are discussed. Based on the findings of this review the following recommendations can be made with regard to tocolysis with calcium channel blockers: firstly, calcium channel blockers should not be combined with intravenous beta-agonists; secondly, intravenous nicardipine or high oral doses of nifedipine should not be used in cases where the mother is cardiovascular compromised or in cases of multiple gestation; finally, blood pressure should be monitored and cardiotocography recorded during the administration of immediate release tablets and patients should be advised to avoid chewing them. To truly establish the safety of tocolytics, all serious adverse effects of tocolytics should be reported to a central point and be critically reviewed.",

    "47": "We have developed [(11)C]mirtazapine as a ligand for PET studies of antidepressant binding in living brain. However, previous studies have determined neither optimal methods for quantification of [(11)C]mirtazapine binding nor the pharmacological identity of this binding. To obtain that information, we have now mapped the distribution volume (V(d)) of [(11)C]mirtazapine relative to the arterial input in the brain of three pigs, in a baseline condition and after pretreatment with excess cold mirtazapine (3 mg/kg). Baseline V(d) ranged from 6 ml/ml in cerebellum to 18 ml/ml in frontal cortex, with some evidence for a small self-displaceable binding component in the cerebellum. Regional binding potentials (pBs) obtained by a constrained two-compartment model, using the V(d) observation in cerebellum, were consistently higher than pBs obtained by other arterial input or reference tissue methods. We found that adequate quantification of pB was obtained using the simplified reference tissue method. Concomitant PET studies with [(15)O]-water indicated that mirtazapine challenge increased CBF uniformly in cerebellum and other brain regions, supporting the use of this reference tissue for calculation of [(11)C]mirtazapine pB. Displacement by mirtazapine was complete in the cerebral cortex, but only 50% in diencephalon, suggesting the presence of multiple binding sites of differing affinities in that tissue. Competition studies with yohimbine and RX 821002 showed decreases in [(11)C]mirtazapine pB throughout the forebrain; use of the multireceptor version of the Michaelis-Menten equation indicated that 42% of [(11)C]mirtazapine binding in cortical regions is displaceable by yohimbine. Thus, PET studies confirm that [(11)C]mirtazapine affects alpha(2)-adrenoceptor binding sites in living brain.",

The signal transduction pathways involved in carbachol (CCh)-induced calcium sensitization in beta-escin permeabilized rat and guinea-pig bladder smooth muscles were investigated and the results were compared with guinea-pig taenia caecum. 2. Calcium contractions elicited cumulatively (pCa 7.5-5) in the presence of calmodulin were significantly increased in all three tissues when CCh (50 microM) was added to the medium. 3. Under constant [Ca2+]i conditions (pCa 6), calmodulin (1 microM) and then GTP (100 microM) initiated significant contractions. CCh (50 microM) added to the bath caused a further contraction in all three tissues - calcium sensitization. This sensitization was significantly inhibited by atropine (50 microM). 4. The incubation of the tissues with the IP3-receptor blocker 2-APB (30 microM) reduced the subsequent development of calcium sensitization by CCh in rat bladder but did not affect it in guinea-pig bladder and taenia ceacum. 5. The Rho kinase (ROK) inhibitor Y-27632 (5 microM) added in the presence of CCh reversed the calcium sensitization in rat bladder, whereas a transient contraction followed by a relaxation to a level not significantly different from the CCh contraction was seen in both guinea-pig bladder and taenia caecum. Y-27632 (1 microM) continuously present significantly inhibited the CCh-induced Ca2+ sensitization in rat bladder but not in guinea-pig bladder or taenia caecum. 6. In the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) (1 microM) and calmodulin (1 microM), Y-27632 (5 microM) did not change the calcium response curve (3 x 10(-7)-10(-5) M) in rat bladder but increased the contractile responses significantly in both guinea-pig bladder and taenia caecum. 7. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF 109203X (5 microM) added in the presence of CCh inhibited the calcium sensitization induced by this muscarinic agonist in all three tissues in different ratios. 8. In conclusion, muscarinic receptor activation induces calcium sensitization in rat and guinea-pig detrusor smooth muscles but there are differences in their pathways.",

The decrease in blood pressure level induced by the four tested drugs was larger in SAD rats than in sham-operated rats, which decreased to about 10 mmHg. Pulse interval was not changed by the treatment of captopril, but prolonged by atenolol in both sham-operated and SAD rats. In sham-operated groups, treatment of both nifedipine and hydrochlorothiazide decreased pulse interval. Whereas in sinoaortic denervated ones, this tachycardia was prevented. Among the four tested drugs, it was found that only nifedipine and atenolol significantly decreased blood pressure variability in SAD rats. It can be concluded that arterial baroreflex function was able to attenuate the hypotensive effects produced by antihypertensive drugs in conscious rats.",

However, there are few reports concerning the long-term prognosis of Japanese patients with DCM in relation to these treatments.", 
    "54": "One hundred and fifty patients with DCM were divided into 2 groups: group A (n=46) (diagnosis: 1982-1989) and group B (n=104) (diagnosis: 1990-2002). During follow-up period of 6.9+/-4.8 years, 62 patients died and 1 patient had a heart transplant. The survival rate at 5 and 10 years was 60.9% and 34.8%, respectively, in group A patients, and 80.9% and 65.3%, respectively, in group B patients (p=0.0079). In group A patients, ACEI/ARB or beta blockers were less frequently used (p<0.0001), whereas antiarrhythmics (class Ia or Ib) were more often used (p<0.0001). The patients treated with ACEI/ARB and beta blockers showed a better survival rate than those without (p<0.0001). The patients with antiarrhythmics showed a worse survival rate than those without (p<0.0001).",

    "56": "The benefits of acute D-propranolol (D-Pro, non-beta-adrenergic receptor blocker) pretreatment against enhanced ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury of hearts from moderate iron-overloaded rats were examined. Perfused hearts from iron-dextran-treated rats (450 mg/kg/week for 3 weeks, intraperitoneal administration) exhibited normal control function, despite iron treatment that elevated plasma iron and conjugated diene levels by 8.1-and 2.5-fold, respectively. However, these hearts were more susceptible to 25 mins of global I/R stress compared with non-loaded hearts; the coronary flow rate, aortic output, cardiac work, left ventricular systolic pressure, positive differential left ventricular pressure (dP/dt), and left ventricular developed pressure displayed 38%, 60%, 55%, 13%, 41%, and 15% lower recoveries, respectively, and a 6.5-fold increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Postischemic hearts from iron-loaded rats also exhibited 5.6-, 3.48-, 2.43-, and 3.45-fold increases in total effluent iron content, conjugated diene levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and lysosomal N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAGA) activity, respectively, compared with similarly stressed non-loaded hearts. A comparison of detection time profiles during reperfusion suggests that most of the oxidative injury (conjugated diene) in hearts from iron-loaded rats occurred at later times of reperfusion (8.5-15 mins), and this corresponded with heightened tissue iron and NAGA release. D-Pro (2 microM infused for 30 mins) pretreatment before ischemia protected all parameters compared with the untreated iron-loaded group; pressure indices improved 1.2- to 1.6-fold, flow parameters improved 1.70- to 2.96-fold, cardiac work improved 2.87-fold, and end-diastolic pressure was reduced 56%. D-Pro lowered total release of tissue iron, conjugated diene content, LDH activity, and NAGA activity 4.59-, 2.55-, 3.04-, and 4.14-fold, respectively, in the effluent of I/R hearts from the iron-loaded group. These findings suggest that the enhanced postischemic dysfunction and tissue injury of hearts from iron-loaded rats was caused by excessive iron-catalyzed free radical stress, and that the membrane antioxidant properties of D-Pro and its stabilization of sequestered lysosomal iron by D-Pro may contribute to the cardioprotective actions of D-Pro.",

Use of beta-blockers and aspirin at the time of discharge after AMI was assessed according to Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in milliliters per minute per 1.73 m2, stratified by admission to the coronary care unit (CCU) versus other wards. Adjusted odds ratios for discharge beta-blocker and aspirin therapy were calculated by using logistic regression.", 
    "59": "Among 431 patients, overall discharge use of beta-blockers was 86.8%, and aspirin, 86.8%, both significantly greater after CCU admission than admission to other wards (93%, aspirin use; 91.7%, beta-blocker use; P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). In logistic regression, CCU admission was the only independent factor associated with either beta-blocker or aspirin use; MDRD eGFR was not associated significantly with beta-blocker and aspirin use regardless of admission to the CCU or non-CCU.", 
    "60": "Future studies of disparities in use of standard-of-care medications after AMI according to renal function should account for the primary site of admission, particularly CCU versus others. In addition, legitimate contraindications to the use of beta-blockers and aspirin may be subtle, including appropriate end-of-life decisions.", 
    "61": "We observed the direct positive chronotropic effect of angiotensin II in mouse atria and characterized its pharmacological property. C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital and hearts were quickly excised. Atrial preparations including right and left atrium were isolated and suspended in the organ bath filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Angiotensin II at concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M caused concentration-dependent increase in heart rate, and the maximal response was about 13% of that by isoproterenol. The effect was blocked by the selective AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan at concentrations of 10(-6) M, but not by the selective beta-blocker, nadolol at concentration of 10(-5) M. Furthermore, angiotensin I also caused concentration-dependent increase in heart rate, and the effect was blocked by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril at concentrations of 10(-6) M. These results suggested that angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II via ACE system in mice atria, and regulate heart rate through AT1-receptor stimulation, not by beta-adrenergic receptor.",

Postbypass measurements tested responses to positive (dopamine) and negative (esmolol) inotropic agents.",

Conversely, impaired shortening occurred when transverse fiber direction was tested. Both oblique areas demonstrated comparable time-delay changes between free wall and septal descending and ascending segment at onset (75+/-11 ms) and termination (86+/-21 ms) of contraction. Dopamine increased heart rate and caused a similar increase of free wall descending and ascending segment SS% to 24+/-2% and 14+/-3% (p<0.05), and septal SS% response to 16+/-2% and 15+/-2% (p<0.05), and comparable decrease of time-delay changes of shortening between ascending and descending segments of 54+/-6 ms and 68+/-10 ms, respectively (p<0.05). Conversely, esmolol decreased heart rate and similarly reduced SS% in left ventricular free wall (descending: 18+/-4%; ascending: 7+/-4%; p<0.05) and septum (descending: 10+/-2%; ascending: 10+/-3%; p<0.05). Time-delay of contraction between segments was increased to 91+/-4 ms (p<0.05), but the hiatus at the end of shortening remained unchanged, due to prolonged endocardial contraction.",

We compared CPP achieved with three methods of chest compression: manual (MAN), mechanical (MECH) and high-impulse mechanical (HI) in a porcine model of prolonged ventricular fibrillation (VF). We hypothesized that HI (very rapid acceleration of the down-stroke) would produce greater CPPs than MAN or MECH, and that HI would also produce a higher rate of ROSC.",

Animals were instrumented under anesthesia, and VF was induced and untreated for 8 min. After 2 min of CPR, epinephrine (adrenaline) (0. 1 mg/kg), vasopressin (40 U) and propranolol (1.0 mg) were administered. CPR continued for three more minutes, after which up to three rescue shocks were delivered. CPP was determined in an automated fashion by measuring the difference between aortic and right atrial pressures 0.1s prior to the down-stroke of each compression (i.e. end-relaxation). ROSC was defined as a systolic pressure greater than 80 mmHg sustained for at least 1 min. We analyzed CPP and ROSC using repeated measures ANOVA and Fisher's exact test.",

    "70": "Interpretive approaches for selectivity optimisation, which are those supported by retention models, are able to exploit efficiently the capabilities of the chromatographic system. The resolution of a mixture is usually faced in a first trial by looking for a unique experimental condition, able to resolve all compounds in the sample. If this is not possible, the problem can be outlined with less ambitious aims, focusing on only some compounds. In an extreme case, a single analyte can be individually optimised. Current strategies that give answer to the different goals pursued in the analysis, which are classified as total, partial and specific, are reviewed. Optimisation oriented to deconvolution, useful in case of partial coelution, and robust measurements of resolution, are also outlined. The steps recognised in any chromatographic optimisation procedure, and some fundamentals and tools used in optimisation approaches for isocratic and gradient elution are commented to explain different strategies. Examples of increasing complexity are supplied to explain the problematic arose, and the convenience in applying a certain methodology. Details on the mathematical treatment for each particular optimisation strategy are also given.", 
    "71": "Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is one of the most important drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans. Resonance Raman data, reported for the first time for CYP2D6, show that the CYP2D6 heme is found to be in a six-coordinated low-spin state in the absence of substrates, and it is perturbed to different extents by bufuralol, dextromethorphan, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA). Dextromethorphan and MDMA induce in CYP2D6 a significant amount of five-coordinated high-spin heme species and reduce the polarity of its heme-pocket, whereas bufuralol does not. Spectra of the F120A mutant CYP2D6 suggest that Phe120 is involved in substrate-binding of dextromethorphan and MDMA, being responsible for the spectral differences observed between these two compounds and bufuralol. These differences could be explained postulating a different substrate mobility for each compound in the CYP2D6 active site, consistently with the role previously suggested for Phe120 in binding dextromethorphan and MDMA.",

Isolated buffer-perfused hearts were divided randomly into four groups, sham operation (SO), myocardial ischemia and reperfusion (IR), carvedilol (CV) and heptanol (a gap junctional inhibitor) (HT). The effect of carvedilol on GJIC was measured by a modification of Scrape-loading and dye transfer method, and the state of CX43 phosphorylation was evaluated by Western blot.",

CHF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any adult patient who presents with dyspnea and/or respiratory failure. The diagnosis of heart failure is often determined by a careful history and physical examination and characteristic chest-radiograph findings. The measurement of serum brain natriuretic peptide and echocardiography have substantially improved the accuracy of diagnosis. Therapy for CHF is directed at restoring normal cardiopulmonary physiology and reducing the hyperadrenergic state. The cornerstone of treatment is a combination of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and slow titration of a beta blocker. Patients with CHF are prone to pulmonary complications, including obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. Continuous positive airway pressure and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation benefit patients in CHF exacerbations.", 
    "81": "Over the last 30 years, there has been considerable progress in the management of aneurysms of the ascending aorta whether isolated or related to Marfan's syndrome which has considerably increased the life expectancy of these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the management protocol proposed in France for this condition in order to establish recommendations. A questionnaire was sent to cardiologists, paediatric cardiologists and cardiac surgeons and also to patients diagnosed with Marfan's syndrome. Most of the 228 physicians who replied prohibited violent sporting activities and less than a quarter advised against all sports. There was a wide dispersion in the prescription of beta blockers in Marfan's syndrome as 57% proposed this treatment only in cases with dilatation of the aorta and 5% prescribed no treatment at all. On the other hand, beta blockers were widely prescribed (93%) after replacement of the ascending aorta. When poorly tolerated in adults, the most commonly prescribed option was a calcium antagonist (60%) followed by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and therapeutic abstention. On the other hand, 60% of paediatric cardiologists preferred to withdraw treatment. These results were confirmed by the replies from patients with Marfan's syndrome: 58.3% were prescribed beta blockers with a higher proportion in children less than 12 years of age. This treatment was introduced late, about 7 years after diagnosis. The authors conclude that there is much disparity in the management of ascending aortic aneurysms whether or not associated with Marfan's syndrome, especially with regards the prescription of beta blockers, justifying the publication of recommendations.", 
    "82": "They have been a standard of care for years, but a new study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University Medical School suggests that beta blockers may be doing more harm than good for HF patients with the non-systolic form of the disease. It's a small study, and the findings are controversial, but investigators believe practitioners should at least give the evidence some thought when caring for this group of patients.", 
    "83": "Protection of ischemic myocardium has been attempted by a variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical methods. When the coronary intervention is not indicated by some reasons in patients with ischemic heart failure, medical treatments are expected to offer cardioprotection against the persistence of stenotic/occlusive lesions of the epicardial coronary artery. The pharmaceuticals such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker, Ca antagonist, ATP-sensitive K channel opener and statin, or non-pharmaceutical approaches such as physical exercise, cardiac resynchronization, ventricular assist devices, and preconditioning upon ischemic insults appear to improve myocardial endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) function. Such eNOS activation contributes to amelioration of the cardiac dysfunction and remodeling induced by myocardial ischemia. Therefore, based on clinical evidence and basic research on clinical demand, we postulate a concept of 'myocardial endothelial NO activator' from the standpoint of mechanistic insights beyond the class-effects of each pharmaceutical category and each non-pharmaceutical intervention. In addition to such continuous eNOS activation for treating chronic ischemic heart failure, rapid eNOS activation in the setting of acute ischemic events upon chronic myocardial ischemia by new strategies such as postconditioning seems to be also essential for developing further effective anti-heart-failure therapies.",

    "88": "One of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ADs) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the norepinephrine (NE) in the synaptic gap. Many ADs increase synaptic NE availability by inhibition of the reuptake of NE. Using mice lacking NE transporter (NET-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) upon treatment with ADs that display different pharmacological profiles. In both tests, the NET-/- mice behaved like wild-type (WT) mice acutely treated with ADs. Autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand [3H]CGP12177 in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of beta-adrenergic receptors similar to those obtained with ADs treatment. The binding of [3H]prazosin to alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of NET-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular NE levels observed in these mice. A pronounced NET knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the TST (by ca 50%) compared to WT mice was not reduced any further by NET-inhibiting ADs such as reboxetine, desipramine, and imipramine. Citalopram, which is devoid of affinity for the NET, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the NET-/- mice. In the FST, reboxetine, desipramine, imipramine, and citalopram administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by NET knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered desipramine was observed in NET-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. From the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the NET may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of adrenergic receptors, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular NE.", 
    "89": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid capable of regulating critical physiological and pathological functions. Here, we report for the first time that S1P stimulates aldosterone secretion in cells of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. Regulation of aldosterone secretion is important because this hormone controls electrolyte and fluid balance and is implicated in cardiovascular homeostasis. S1P-stimulated aldosterone secretion was dependent upon the protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms alpha and delta and extracellular Ca2+, and it was inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX). S1P activated phospholipase D (PLD) through a PTX-sensitive mechanism, also involving PKC alpha and delta and extracellular Ca2+. Primary alcohols, which attenuate the formation of phosphatidic acid (the product of PLD), and cell-permeable ceramides, which inhibit PLD activity, blocked S1P-stimulated aldosterone secretion. Furthermore, propranolol, chlorpromazine, and sphingosine, which are potent inhibitors of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) (the enzyme that produces diacylglycerol from phosphatidate), also blocked aldosterone secretion. These data suggest that the PLD/PAP pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of aldosterone secretion by S1P and that Gi protein-coupled receptors, extracellular Ca2+, and the PKC isoforms alpha and delta are all important components in the cascade of events controlling this process.", 
    "90": "Among the potential effects of exposure to high levels of radio-frequency energy (RFE) (which includes microwaves), an increase in body temperature is the primary consequence. Release of autacoids and activity of the autonomic nervous system may influence (or be directly responsible for) some of the physiological changes that occur in conjunction with this hyperthermia. The main focus of this review is the interaction of autacoids and the autonomic nervous system with cardiovascular changes during heating. Differences between environmental and RFE-induced heating (such as rate of temperature change and degree of skin vs. core heating) may be important when considering these effects. Antihistamines exhibited no beneficial effect on circulatory collapse during RFE-induced heating. The serotonergic blocker methysergide decreased survival time in rats during terminal RFE exposure, despite no effects on heart rate (HR) or blood pressure. Although blockade of platelet-activating factor resulted in lower HR before RFE exposure, there was a lack of effect on the subsequent increase in HR during heating. Nitric oxide did not contribute to the hypotension that occurs due to rapid heating by RFE exposure. There have been either no or very limited studies of effects of prostaglandins, bradykinin, or angiotensin on RFE-induced heating responses. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonism with propranolol resulted in significantly decreased survival times and lower final colonic temperatures during RFE exposure. A lack of effects of nadolol on survival time and temperature, coupled with its poor ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier, suggests that central beta-adrenergic stimulation rather than peripheral stimulation may alter thermoregulation. Effects of the autonomic nervous system (as studied by adrenoceptor blockade) on potassium changes during heating have not been fully investigated. Such changes could be important in animals' responses to RFE and other modalities of heating, and should be studied in future.",

Occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, total hospital costs, and both intensive care unit (ICU) and total hospital length of stay (LOS) were compared between groups. Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted to examine study results as part of a quadrant analysis and to calculate confidence intervals for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

The roles of intramuscular forms of ziprasidone and olanzapine in the treatment of acute agitation and aggression are discussed. We review general considerations pertaining to persistent aggression in inpatients and outpatients, including comorbidity of major mental disorders with substance use disorders and personality disorders. The role of clozapine as an antiaggressive agent is well established, particularly in inpatients. Evidence also exists for the efficacy of risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Anticonvulsants and lithium are widely used with the intent to control aggression, but their efficacy lacks strong evidential support. Benzodiazepines have a role in controlling acute agitation, but their long-term use for persistent aggression is not recommended. There is evidence for antiaggressive effects of SSRIs and hormonal agents with antiandrogenic properties. Beta-adrenergic blockers and electroconvulstive treatment are rarely used in clinical practice to control aggression, but they may be effective. The heterogeneity of aggressive behavior is a challenge for developing rational treatments. Emerging genetic findings hold a promise of future treatments of aggressive behavior developed on the basis of individual patients' genotypes.", 
    "105": "Recently we predicted the 3D structure of the human beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) and of the binding site of several agonists and antagonists to beta2AR. These predictions (MembStruk and HierDock) included no explicit water and only a few lipid molecules. Here we include explicit H(2)O and an infinite lipid bilayer membrane in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of three systems: apo-beta2AR, epinephrine-bound beta2AR, and butoxamine-bound beta2AR (epinephrine is an endogenous agonist, and butoxamine is a beta2AR selective antagonist). The predicted structures for apo-beta2AR and butoxamine-beta2AR are stable in MD, but in epinephrine-beta2AR, extracellular water trickles into the binding pocket to mediate hydrogen bonding between the catechol of epinephrine and Ser-204 on helix 5. The epinephrine-beta2AR structure shows dynamic flexibility with small, piston-like movements of helices 3 and 6 and transient interhelical hydrogen bonding between Ser-165 on transmembrane 4 and Ser-207 on transmembrane 5. These couplings and motions may play a role in protein activation. The apo-beta2AR shows less dynamic flexibility, whereas the antagonist-beta2AR structure is quite rigid. This MD validation of the structure predictions for G protein-coupled receptors in explicit lipid and water suggests that these methods can be trusted for studying the mechanism of activation and the design of subtype-specific agonists and antagonists.", 
    "106": "We address the problem of designing pharmacokinetic experiments in multivariate response situations. Criteria, based on the Fisher information matrix, whose inverse according to the Rao-Cramer inequality is the lower bound of the variance-covariance matrix of any unbiased estimator of the parameters, have previously been developed for univariate response for an individual and a population. We extend these criteria to design individual and population studies where more than one response is measured, for example, when both parent drug and metabolites are measured in plasma, multi-compartment models, where measurements are taken at more than one site, or when drug concentration and pharmacodynamic data are collected simultaneously. We assume that measurements made at distinct times are independent, but measurements made of each concentration are correlated with a response variance-covariance matrix. We investigated a number of optimisation algorithms, namely simplex, exchange, adaptive random search, simulated annealing and a hybrid, to maximise the determinant of the Fisher information matrix as required by the D-optimality criterion. The multiresponse optimal design methodology developed was applied in two case studies, where the aim was to suggest optimal sampling times. The first was a restrospective iv infusion experiment aimed to characterise the disposition kinetics of tolcapone and its two metabolites in healthy volunteers. The second was a prospective iv bolus experiment designed to estimate the tissue disposition kinetics of eight beta-blockers in rat.", 
    "107": "Neurons in the CNS can regenerate their axons in an environment of the peripheral nervous system, but this ability is limited. Here we show that an anti-glaucoma drug, nipradilol, at low concentration led to a four-fold increase in the number of cat retinal ganglion cells regenerating their axons into a transplanted peripheral nerve 4 and 6 weeks after axotomy. Nipradilol also increased the number of three main regenerating retinal ganglion cell types (alpha, beta, not alpha/beta), and enhanced the rate of axonal regeneration of these retinal ganglion cells. Nipradilol is a donor of nitric oxide and an antagonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and -2 adrenoreceptors, and we therefore examined whether one of these pharmacological effects might be more important in promoting axon regeneration. A nitric oxide donor increased the number of regenerating retinal ganglion cells, but not the rate of axonal regeneration. Denitro-nipradilol (nitric oxide-deprived nipradilol) or a nitric oxide scavenger injected before nipradilol increased the number of regenerating retinal ganglion cells but did not promote regeneration rate. Blockade of individual alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors did not increase the number of regenerating retinal ganglion cells or the rate of regeneration. From these results, it is suggested that nitric oxide plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of nipradilol on axon regeneration and neuroprotection, and the metabolite of nipradilol supports the effects.",

We review the evidence and indications.", 
    "109": "The number of patients with newly diagnosed heart failure continues to grow worldwide, to some extent reflecting the increase in survival after acute coronary syndromes and the aging of the population. The search for new and effective therapies for this condition remains a priority in the 21st century. The use of beta-blockers is now well established in the clinical context of mild and moderate systolic heart failure. The effects of beta-blockade on mortality are additive to those with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Recently completed, large, randomized trials provided strong evidence for the use of beta-blockers in severe (NYHA functional class IV) heart failure and in asymptomatic patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and recent myocardial infarction. Obviously, patient selection still remains the key to the safe use of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure. Further data from clinical trials have emerged to support similar benefits in terms of mortality and morbidity, a good safety record, and tolerability in patients at extremes of age (children and adults >70 years of age) and in specific clinical circumstances (including diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, renal failure, and atrial fibrillation). Recent use of beta-blockers with vasodilatory properties in patients with heart failure and preserved systolic function (so-called diastolic heart failure) appears promising but will require large-scale, long-term trials prior to widespread clinical use.", 
    "110": "In 1997 and 2003 the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension (JNC VI and JNC VII) gave beginning dose recommendations for antihypertensive drugs that were lower than those found in drug package inserts and the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). Popular handheld Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) programs recommended the JNC starting dose only 35% of the time and standard textbooks 34% of the time. Prescribing patterns at an academic medical center reflected PDR guidelines for the thiazide diuretics and a calcium channel blocker, but they were closer to JNC guidelines for beta adrenergic blockers. The higher thiazide doses recommended by the PDR were associated with hypokalemia. The PDR gives 2.4 mg of clonidine daily as the maximum effective dose, twice the maximum dose recommended by the JNC. High clonidine doses were used 14% of the time in inpatients and in 9% of outpatient prescriptions at an academic medical center, even though high doses of clonidine raise rather than lower blood pressure. When recommendations for high doses of antihypertensive medications in the package insert conflict with JNC recommendations, the package insert recommendations carry through to the PDR, textbooks, PDAs, and to some physician prescriptions.", 
    "111": "Atherosclerosis is a systemic process with multi-focal distribution which progresses or regresses in an entirely independent manner within each patient. The low and oscillatory shear stress along with the geometrical particularities of the coronaries modulate an atherogenic microenvironment in susceptible to atherosclerosis regions and determine the disease's rate of progression. However, the atherogenic effect of flow pulsation remains ambiguous. Since the pulsatile nature of the blood constitutes the major generator of the oscillatory shear stress, one could hypothesize that this physiological process might exert a synergistic effect to low SS by facilitating the lesion progression. The heart rate determines directly the frequency of flow pulsation; therefore, its reduction could potentially decelerate the progression of atherosclerosis by alleviating the local atherogenic hemodynamic environment. This perspective might constitute an insight into the beneficial role of heart rate lowering agents with most significant representative the beta-blockers, which have been proved quite efficient anti-atherosclerotic drugs.", 
    "112": "A multi-residue analytical method has been developed and validated for determining a selection of 16 pharmaceuticals: the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, seven analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs (mefenamic acid, indomethacine, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ketorolac and acetaminophen), the analgesic opiate codeine, two antidepressants (fluoxetine and paroxetine), beta-blockers (atenolol and propranolol), antibiotic (trimethoprim, metronidazole, and erythromycin) and the anti-ulcer ranitidine in hospital effluent wastewaters. The method allows simultaneous extraction of the pharmaceuticals compounds by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using the Waters Oasis HLB at pH 7. The analytes were then identified and quantitatively determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Recoveries of the pharmaceuticals were higher than 75%, with the exception of ranitidine (45%) and the overall variability of the method was below 9%. The instrumental detection limit (IDL) varied between 2 and 31 pg injected, the method detection limit (LOD) was between 7 and 47 ng/L in spiked hospital effluent. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation (RSD), ranged from 0.3 to 4.9%. A detail study off matrix effect is included in this work, regarding to signal suppression in these effluent wastewaters from a hospital complex samples. The developed analytical method was applied for preliminary data results in effluent wastewaters from a hospital.", 
    "113": "Both human and animal studies suggest that there are sex differences in responding to noxious stimulation as well as in effects of opiate analgesic drugs. Development and/or expression of tolerance to opiate analgesia are also affected by the hormonal status of the experimental subjects. The present study aimed to compare acute tolerance to morphine in cycling and ovariectomized female rats and to evaluate the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channel blocker memantine as well as 17-beta-estradiol on tolerance development using the tail-flick test. Acute tolerance to morphine analgesia was observed as a substantial reduction in the response to a test dose of morphine (10 mg/kg) given 6 h after the tolerance-inducing dose (10 mg/kg). Significant acute tolerance was observed in proestrous female rats and was prevented by memantine (3 or 10 mg/kg) treatment. Ovariectomized rats did not demonstrate tolerance to morphine analgesic effects but chronic estradiol administration (5 microg/day, 5 days) reinstated induction of tolerance. Both estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen (5 mg/kg/day, 5 days) and memantine (3 mg/kg/day, 5 days) prevented estradiol-induced tolerance in ovariectomized rats. Thus, estrogens were found to play a key role in induction of acute tolerance to morphine antinociception. Estradiol-induced acute morphine tolerance may have NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms.",

    "120": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects of long-term treatment with rilmenidine compared with atenolol on lipid and glucose metabolism and cardiovascular remodelling in hypertension. In total, 37 patients with hypertension were randomised to rilmenidine 1-2 mg/day or atenolol 50-100 mg/day for 26 weeks. Standard oral glucose tolerance test with a parallel measurement of insulin and glucose levels was performed. The 'areas under the curve' (AUC) for insulin and glucose were calculated. Plasma lipids, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and intima-media thickness (IMT) were measured. Brachial artery diameter during reactive hyperaemia was used to test endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDVD). Blood pressure reduction was equally achieved in both treatment arms. The fasting glucose level increased in the atenolol group from 4.8+/-0.6 to 5.2+/-0.7 mmol/l (P<0.01). The AUC of glucose in rilmenidine group decreased from 860+/-93 to 737+/-66 mmol/min/l (P<0.05), and in the atenolol group it increased from 937+/-86 to 989+/-88 mmol/min/l (P<0.05). Rilmenidine showed a positive effect on lipid levels, whereas in the atenolol group a significant decrease of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed. Left ventricular mass index decreased with rilmenidine by 9.6% and by 6.9% with atenolol (P<0.05). Intima-media thickness significantly decreased in the rilmenidine group. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation slightly increased on in the rilmenidine group, while on in the atenolol group it remained unchanged. Our data suggest that in hypertensive patients central inhibition of sympathetic drive can produce favourable effects on glucose and lipid metabolism compared with standard beta-blockade with a similar antihypertensive efficacy. Rilmenidine also provides beneficial effects on cardiovascular remodelling and altered endothelial function in hypertension.",

    "134": "Inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin, a specific blocker of the catalytic beta-subunits, results in transient neurite outgrowth by neuronal cell lines. Vice versa, as demonstrated in this study, treatment of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) or other differentiating agents reduces proteasomal activity. This is accompanied by an increase in mRNA and protein levels of the catalytically active subunits beta1, beta2 and beta5, but not of their inducible counterparts, indicating changes in subunit composition of the proteasome during neuronal differentiation. In contrast to neuronal cell lines, however, pre-treatment of primary neurons with proteasome inhibitors completely prevents axon formation, and lower concentrations of lactacystin (0.5-5 microm) significantly reduce axonal elongation and branching in vitro. Furthermore, established axonal networks degenerate rapidly and long-term survival of peripheral neurons is impaired in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. Axonal pathology is reminiscent of the morphological changes observed in neurodegenerative disorders and supports a crucial role of the constitutive catalytic subunits in axon initiation, maintenance and regeneration.", 
    "135": "In most in vitro studies of oral drug permeability, little attempt is made to reproduce the gastrointestinal lumenal environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the compatibility of simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) solutions with Caco-2 cell monolayers and Ussing chamber-mounted rat ileum under standard permeability experiment protocols. In preliminary experiments, fasted-state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) and fed-state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) solutions based on the dissolution medium formulae of Dressman and co-workers (1998) were modified for compatibility with Caco-2 cells to produce FaS-SIF and FeSSIF \"transport\" solutions for use with in vitro permeability models. For Caco-2 cells exposed to FaSSIF and FESSIF transport solutions, the transepithelial electrical resistance was maintained for over 4 h and mannitol permeability was equivalent to that in control (Hank's Balanced Salt Solution-treated) cell layers. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that microvilli generally maintained a normal distribution, although some shortening of microvilli and occasional small areas of denudation were observed. For rat ileum in the Ussing chambers, the potential difference (PD) collapsed to zero over 120 min when exposed to the FaSSIF transport solution and an even faster collapse of the PD was observed when the FeSSIF transport solution was used. Electron micrographs revealed erosion of the villi tips and substantial denudation of the microvilli after exposure of ileal tissue to FaSSIF and FeSSIF solutions, and permeability to mannitol was increased by almost two-fold. This study indicated that FaSSIF and FeSSIF transport solutions can be used with Caco-2 monolayers to evaluate drug permeability, but rat ileum in Ussing chambers is adversely affected by these solutions. Metoprolol permeability in Caco-2 experiments was reduced by 33% using the FaSSIF and 75% using the FeSSIF compared to permeability measured using HBSS. This illustrates that using physiological solutions can influence permeability measurements.", 
    "136": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a common and disabling condition with an incidence and prevalence that increase sharply with age. The median age of presentation of new heart failure cases is > 75 years. Effective treatments, including beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, have been proven in randomised, controlled trials. The average age in these placebo-controlled mortality and morbidity studies of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in heart failure has, however, been < 63 years, and all patients with an ejection fraction > or = 40% were excluded. This lack of a representative sample of elderly patients with heart failure has raised concerns about extrapolating the available evidence for beta-adrenoceptor antagonists to a more elderly heart failure population. Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may have a less beneficial effect or even an adverse effect in elderly heart failure patients. There is evidence that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are less frequently prescribed in elderly CHF patients, and that this lack of treatment is associated with impaired outcomes. Establishing which beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, if any, are effective in elderly CHF is therefore of extreme importance. The elderly have a reduced cardiovascular reserve and may be less tolerant of the introduction of a vasoconstricting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition, the higher proportion of elderly CHF patients with relatively preserved systolic function (for which no treatment has been proven to reduce mortality and morbidity) means that we cannot say with certainty that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have been proven to be effective in a general elderly CHF population. Third-generation beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with vasodilating actions in addition to their beta-adrenoceptor antagonist effects may offer several theoretical advantages over earlier beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for elderly CHF patients. Three of this class (carvedilol, bucindolol and nebivolol) have been evaluated with respect to their efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity in CHF, and only two of these (carvedilol and nebivolol) had a proven outcome benefit in a properly powered randomised, controlled trial. Only the Study of the Effects of Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure (which used the vasodilating third-generation beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nebivolol) has prospectively investigated the treatment of CHF in elderly patients, including those with preserved systolic function, and demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of death or cardiovascular hospitalisation. In conclusion, prescribers are advised that nebivolol should be preferred in elderly patients with CHF, because of its proven efficacy in a representative group of elderly CHF patients.", 
    "137": "There is growing evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the pathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The occurrence of oxidative DNA damage in trabecular meshwork (TM) has been demonstrated by measuring the increase of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, the most abundant DNA oxidative alteration, which is significantly increased in glaucoma-bearing subjects as compared with unaffected controls. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that ROS play a fundamental pathogenic role, including the following: (a) outflow resistance in the anterior chamber increases in the presence of high levels of hydrogen peroxide; (b) TM possesses abundant antioxidant activities; (c) significant increases in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities were detected in the aqueous humour of glaucoma patients; (d) hydrogen peroxide compromises TM integrity. The existence of a significant correlation between oxidative DNA damage and intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients has been reported. POAG patients appear to have a genetic predisposition rendering them susceptible to ROS-induced damage because of a more frequent deletion, as compared to controls, of the gene encoding for glutathione-S-transferase M1, a pivotal anti-oxidant activity. Furthermore, oxidative stress, occurring not only in TM but also in retinal cells, appears to be involved in the neuronal cell death that characterizes POAG. These considerations could bear relevance for POAG prevention and suggest that genetic analyses and the use of drugs or dietary measures attenuating the effects of ROS, if validated in future studies, could be useful tools contributing to the control of this disease.",

    "146": "Fifteen HF patients participated to this double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over study. Patients were evaluated by quality of life questionnaire, echocardiography, pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (ramp and constant workload) both in normoxia (FiO2 = 21%) and hypoxia (FiO2 = 16%, equivalent to a simulated altitude of 2000 m). Carvedilol improved clinical condition and reduced left ventricle size, but had no effect on lung mechanics. In normoxia during exercise, ventilation was lower, V(CO2) unchanged and PaCO2 (constant workload) or PetCO2 (ramp) higher with carvedilol, exercise capacity was unchanged (peak workload 92+/-22 and 90+/-22W for placebo and carvedilol, respectively). Abnormal V(E)/V(CO2) slope was reduced by carvedilol. Hypoxia increased ventilation but less with carvedilol; exercise capacity decreased to 87+/-21W (placebo) and to 80+/-11 W (carvedilol, p < 0.01). With hypoxia, carvedilol decreased V(E)/V(CO2) slope. At constant workload exercise with hypoxia, PaO2 decreased to 69+/-6 mm Hg (placebo) and to 64+/-5 (carvedilol, p < 0.01).", 
    "147": "Carvedilol reduced hyperventilation possibly by reducing peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity as suggested by PaCO2 increase with normoxia and PaO2 decrease with hypoxia without V(CO2) and V(D)/V(T) changes. Lessening hyperventilation is beneficial when breathing normally, but detrimental when hyperventilation is needed for exercise at high altitude.", 
    "148": "Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm is defined as a focal and localized dilatation of the aorta 1.5 to 2 times the diameter of the normal adjacent aorta and containing all three layers of the arterial wall. Conventional open surgical repair remains the gold standard for the majority of the patients with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Endovascular stent-graft aortic repair is a promising emerging therapy, which at present is considered an alternative to surgery in the elderly and in those with significant comorbid conditions. Adjunctive beta-blocker therapy should be used in all patients to reduce the shear force on the aortic wall.", 
    "149": "Multislice helical computed tomography (CT) is a promising noninvasive technique for coronary artery imaging. Various factors can cause inconsistencies in cardiac CT data, which can result in degraded image quality. These inconsistencies may be the result of the patient physiology (e.g., heart rate variations), the nature of the data (e.g., cone-angle), or the reconstruction algorithm itself. An algorithm which provides the best temporal resolution for each slice, for example, often provides suboptimal image quality for the entire volume since the cardiac temporal resolution (TRc) changes from slice to slice. Such variations in TRc can generate strong banding artifacts in multiplanar reconstruction images or three-dimensional images. Discontinuous heart walls and coronary arteries may compromise the accuracy of the diagnosis. A beta-blocker is often used to reduce and stabilize patients' heart rate but cannot eliminate the variation. In order to obtain robust and optimal image quality, a software solution that increases the temporal resolution and decreases the effect of heart rate is highly desirable. This paper proposes an ECG-correlated direct cone-beam reconstruction algorithm (TCOT-EGR) with cardiac banding artifact correction (CBC) and disconnected projections redundancy compensation technique (DIRECT). First the theory and analytical model of the cardiac temporal resolution is outlined. Next, the performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by using computer simulations as well as patient data. It will be shown that the proposed algorithms enhance the robustness of the image quality against inconsistencies by guaranteeing smooth transition of heart cycles used in reconstruction.", 
    "150": "Thirty-eight articles have been published on the association between elevated heart rate and mortality. After adjustment for other risk factors, most studies found an independent association between heart rate and all-cause and/or cardiovascular mortality. This relationship has been found to be generally weaker among females. The four studies performed in hypertensive patients found a positive association between heart rate and all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. In spite of this evidence, elevated heart rate remains a neglected cardiovascular risk factor in both genders. The pathogenetic mechanisms connecting high heart rate, hypertension, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events have also been elucidated in many studies. Several trials retrospectively showed the beneficial effect of cardiac-slowing drugs, such as beta-blockers and non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists on mortality, notably in patients with coronary heart disease, or heart failure, but no published data are available in patients with hypertension free of coronary heart disease. Although it has not been proven in existing trials, it would seem reasonable to recommend in hypertensive subjects with heart rate > 80-85 b/min, antihypertensive agents that decrease the heart rate. The f-channel blockers, selective heart rate-lowering agents with no effect on blood pressure, could also be profitably used in hypertensive subjects with fast heart rate.", 
    "151": "A robust, inexpensive, and fully validated CE method for the simultaneous determination of the enantiomers of propafenone (PPF), 5-hydroxy-propafenone (5OH-PPF) and N-despropyl-propafenone (NOR-PPF) in serum and in in vitro media is described. It is based upon liquid-liquid extraction at alkaline pH followed by analysis of the reconstituted extract by CE in presence of a pH 2.0 running buffer composed of 100 mM sodium phosphate, 19% methanol, and 0.6% highly sulfated beta-CD. For each compound, the S-enantiomers are shown to migrate ahead of their antipodes, and the overall run time is about 30 min. Enantiomer levels between 25 and 1000 ng/mL provide linear calibration graphs, and the LOD for all enantiomers is between 10 and 12 ng/mL. The assay is shown to be suitable for the determination of the enantiomers of PPF and its metabolites in in vitro incubations comprising human liver microsomes or single CYP450 enzymes (SUPERSOMES). Incubations with CYP2D6 SUPERSOMES revealed, for the first time, the simultaneous formation of the enantiomers of 5OH-PPF and NOR-PPF with that enzyme. CE data can be used for the evaluation of the enzymatic N-dealkylation and hydroxylation rates.", 
    "152": "In this study, we investigate the effect of serotonin receptor 5-HT1A stimulation on the feeding behavior of quails (Coturnix japonica). The administration of 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.05 to 5.0 mg/Kg) dose-dependently inhibited the food intake in normally fed quails. Greater inhibition was attained with 5.0 mg/kg (0.93 +/- 0.21 g vs. 5.83 +/- 0.25 g, P < 0.05, 2 h after food offer). A comparable response was obtained from previously fasted quails. At end of 2 h, a higher dose of 8-OH-DPAT induced more intense hypophagy (1.59 +/- 0.41 g vs. 6.85 +/- 1.04 g, P < 0.0001). Previous treatment with the antagonist 5-HT1A/beta-adrenergic, propranolol, failed to block the inhibitory action of 8-OH-DPAT, but instead, intensified it (controls, 5.22 +/- 1.09 g; 8-OH-DPAT, 1.41 +/- 0.19 g; propranolol + 8-OH-DPAT, 0.44 +/- 0.25 g, P < 0.01, for all comparisons). The administration of an isolated higher dose of propranolol induced a hypophagic action (controls, 4.5 +/- 0.8 g vs. propranolol, 2.0 +/- 0.2 g, P < 0.01). Current outcomes suggest a possible role of 5-HT1A receptor on the feeding behavior of quails, as opposed to mammals. On the other hand, the intensified hypophagy induced by previous administration of propranolol raises the hypothesis of a beta-adrenergic excitatory mechanism that controls the feeding behavior of quails.", 
    "153": "The development of cirrhosis and portal hypertension in the natural history of chronic liver disease is associated with many complications. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) is a metal prosthesis that has been shown to be very effective in lowering sinusoidal portal pressure, and therefore is effective in the management of complications of cirrhosis, especially those related to portal hypertensive bleeding and sodium and water retention. In patients with acute variceal bleeding not responding to pharmacologic and endoscopic treatments, a reduction of the hepatic venous pressure gradient to < 12 mmHg or by > 20% with TIPS has been shown to be effective in controlling the acute bleed and in preventing rebleeding. For stable patients whose acute variceal bleed is controlled, TIPS is equal to combined beta-blocker and band ligation in the prevention of recurrent variceal bleed. TIPS is also more effective than large volume paracentesis in the control of refractory ascites, and may confer a survival advantage over repeated large volume paracentesis. TIPS has also been used in the management of other complications related to portal hypertension including ectopic varices, hepatic hydrothorax, and hepatorenal syndrome with some success, but experience is still rather limited. Miscellaneous uses include treatment of Budd Chiari Syndrome, portal hypertensive gastropathy and hepatopulmonary syndrome. Careful patient selection is vital to a successful outcome, as patients with severe liver dysfunction tend to die post-TIPS despite a functioning shunt. All patients who require a TIPS for treatment of complications of cirrhosis should be referred for consideration of liver transplant.",

During this first year of treatment, 77 patients encountered a non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction and were excluded to avoid bias. During the next 3-4 years, 610 composite endpoints [cardiovascular death (n = 228), fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke] were recorded.", 
    "156": "In Cox regression analyses, the composite endpoint was after adjustment for treatment allocation predicted by baseline logUACR [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16 per 10-fold increase, P < 0.05], 1-year logUACR (HR = 1.29 per 10-fold increase), baseline Sokolow-Lyon voltage (HR = 1.01 per mm, both P < 0.001) and 1-year Cornell product (HR = 1.01 per 100 mm x ms, P < 0.01). Cardiovascular death was predicted by 1-year logUACR (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001), baseline Sokolow-Lyon voltage (HR = 1.01, P = 0.06) and 1-year Cornell product (HR = 1.02, P < 0.001).

    "163": "The existence of an association between the brain and immunity has been documented. Data show that the nervous and immune systems communicate with one another to maintain immune homeostasis. Activated immune cells secrete cytokines that influence central nervous system activity, which in turn, activates output through the peripheral nervous system to regulate the level of immune cell activity and the subsequent magnitude of an immune response. In this review, we will focus our presentation and discussion on the findings that indicate a regulatory role for the peripheral sympathetic nervous system in modulating the level of cytokine and antibody produced during an immune response. Data will be discussed from studies involving the stimulation of the beta2 adrenergic receptor expressed on CD4+ T cells and B cells by norepinephrine or selective agonists. We will also discuss how dysregulation of this line of communication between the nervous and immune systems might contribute to disease development and progression.", 
    "164": "Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) induces bone remodeling and renewed bone modeling, resulting in net bone gain. beta-blockers improve trabecular bone architecture in young ovariectomized mice by preventing the inhibition of bone formation and stimulation of bone resorption induced by the adrenergic system. To test the hypothesis that PTH and beta-blockers may exert synergistic effects on the skeleton, 15-week-old ovariectomized mice were either given oral propranolol (PRO) or left untreated for 8 weeks, adding daily hPTH(1-34) (80 microg/kg/day) or vehicle (VEH) during the last 4 weeks. The skeletal response was evaluated using pDXA, microCT, histomorphometry and biochemical markers. PRO significantly attenuated loss of bone mineral density (BMD) at whole body (WB) (-0.1% in PRO vs. -2.4% in VEH, P < 0.05), but not at spine or femur 4 weeks after OVX. Thereafter, PTH increased BMD at all sites in both PRO- and VEH-treated mice (+6.7% to +14%, P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001 vs. VEH). Over 8 weeks, sequential-combined treatment of PRO and PTH significantly improved BMD over PTH alone at WB (+9.1% vs. +4.4% over baseline, respectively, P < 0.005) and spine (+9% vs. -1.7%, respectively, P < 0.05). These effects were paralleled by a decrease in TRACP5b with PRO (P < 0.05 vs. VEH) and an increase in osteocalcin with PTH, irrespective of PRO (P < 0.0001 vs. VEH). Trabecular bone microarchitecture, such as BV/TV, trabecular number and ConnD, was significantly improved by sequential-combined treatment of PRO and PTH compared to PTH alone. At midshaft femur, both PRO and PTH significantly increased cross-sectional area (CSA), but the effects of the two drugs on CSA and cortical thickness were not additive. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that bone formation was increased by PTH at both cortical and trabecular surfaces, whereas PRO increased osteoblast number and surface on trabecular surfaces. The combined treatment further improved the extent of mineralization and BFR over PTH alone (P < 0.05) at endocortical surfaces and recapitulated the effects of PTH and PRO alone on trabecular surfaces. These results indicate that beta-adrenergic blockade may partially improve the bone remodeling balance induced by estrogen deficiency. In turn, PRO exerted synergistic effects with intermittent PTH on bone mass and cancellous bone architecture. As such, combined therapy of beta-blockers and PTH may be of interest in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.", 
    "165": "The new enantiomerically pure 3-substituted-Delta(2)-isoxazolin-5-yl-ethanolamines (+)-6a/(-)-6b, (-)-6a/(+)-6b, and (+)-7a/(-)-7b, prepared via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition-based approach, were tested for their affinity at human beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) subtypes stably expressed in CHO cells. The corresponding 3-isopropenyl derivatives (+)-5a/(-)-5b, (-)-5a/(+)-5b, and some isoxazole analogs were also tested. The binding affinities at the beta-ARs of the isoxazolinyl amino alcohols were significantly lower than those of the corresponding isoxazole derivatives. A stereochemical effect was observed, since the process of molecular recognition is predominantly controlled by the (S)-configuration of the stereogenic center located at the 5 position of the heterocycle rather than by that of the stereocenter carrying the secondary alcohol group. On the contrary, the stereochemical features marginally affected the efficacy response; as a matter of fact, functional tests carried out on Delta(2)-isoxazoline derivatives provided with a detectable binding affinity showed the overall profile of neutral antagonists at all three beta-AR subtypes."
