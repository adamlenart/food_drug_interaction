To examine the effect of nipradilol on venous blood flow, a single oral dose of nipradilol (6 mg) and propranolol (20 mg) was administered in the same 15 normal volunteers on separate days. Peak flow velocities, flow velocity integrals, and the diameter of the right brachiocephalic vein were measured before and 2 h after drug administration using Doppler echocardiography. These two beta-blockers significantly decreased systolic blood pressure to the same extent as they did heart rate. Nipradilol dilated the venous diameter by 8% and decreased peak flow velocity by 8% during systole and 9% during diastole. The flow velocity integral in one cardiac cycle also decreased significantly by 14%. Propranolol, however, failed to modify these parameters. These results suggest that nipradilol decreased venous return through its nitroglycerin-like direct vasodilating action.", 
    "1": "To clarify the effect of the calcium antagonist Nifedipine and the ACE inhibitor Enalapril on cardiac autonomic activity, power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (PSA) was conducted in 39 elderly patients with essential hypertension (mean age: 63: +/- 11 years) before and after treatment. Twenty patients were treated with 10-20 mg of Nifedipine (N group) and 19 with 5 mg of Enalapril (E group) for 3 months. beta-blocker (Atenolol 12.5 mg) was added to Nifedipine in 12 patients of the N group for 1 month, and the modified effect of Atenolol on cardiac autonomic activity was also evaluated. Blood pressures were significantly reduced in both N and E groups after the treatment. The low frequency component (LF) in PSA, which was considered to be a quantitative marker of cardiac sympathetic activity, increased significantly and the high frequency component (HF), which was a marker of cardiac parasympathetic activity, significantly decreased with increase of PNA levels in N group after the treatment. However, the LF decreased significantly after addition of Atenolol. On the other hand, there was little significant change in LF and PNA in E group. These results suggest that Nifedipine increased cardiac sympathetic activity and that Enalapril had little influence on the cardiac sympathetic tone, while both antihypertensive agents significantly reduced blood pressure itself.", 
    "2": "Epithelial permeability and autofluorescence of the cornea were determined by fluorophotometry in 21 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension using timolol medication with the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAC) and 2 weeks after changing to timolol medication without BAC. The investigation was performed to determine whether removal of BAC would reduce toxic effects on the cornea and complaints of sensations of burning or dry eye. Corneal epithelial permeability decreased significantly after changing medication (mean decrease per patient 27%, P = 0.025). Corneal autofluorescence increased significantly after changing medication suggesting an alteration in corneal metabolism (mean increase per patient 6%, P = 0.003). Timolol without BAC was found to be as effective as timolol with BAC in reducing intraocular pressure (P = 0.4). Removal of BAC from timolol resulted in an improvement of corneal epithelial barrier function and in a reduction of complaints. The improvement was found to be proportional to the duration of the preceding BAC-containing therapy.", 
    "3": "Corneal epithelial permeability and autofluorescence were measured by fluorophotometry in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension to quantify the epithelial function of the cornea and to evaluate its metabolic activity in 24 patients using daily timolol and 11 not using timolol. The findings were compared with those in age-matched healthy controls. Permeability values in patients using timolol were 1.9 times higher than in patients not using timolol and 2.5 times higher than in healthy controls (Mann-Whitney test P < 0.001). Values for patients not using timolol did not differ from those for healthy controls (P = 0.15). Corneal autofluorescence values in each patient group were higher than in healthy controls (P = 0.002).", 
    "4": "(1) open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension alone does not affect corneal epithelial permeability; (2) daily instillation of timolol causes impairment of the corneal epithelial barrier; (3) open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension are likely to induce an increase of corneal autofluorescence.", 
    "5": "1. The subtype and anatomical localization of beta-adrenoceptors mediating facilitation of stimulus-induced overflow of noradrenaline ('prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors') are not conclusively known to date. The present study was undertaken to characterize these receptors by use of pharmacological methods as well as to define their localization (prejunctional or postjunctional) with radio-ligand binding and autoradiography techniques combined with surgical denervation of the sympathetic innervation to the rat kidney. 2. Exposure of the kidney to (-)-isoprenaline, the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, resulted in a dose-dependent facilitation of stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow. This response was inhibited by propranolol, the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, with a pA2 of 9.20 suggesting that the prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors are not of the beta 3-subtype. 3. The rank order of potency and potency ratios of beta-adrenoceptor agonists at renal prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors (EC50 for agonist/EC50 for (-)-isoprenaline) were: (-)-isoprenaline (1) > procaterol (2) > salbutamol (3) > adrenaline (10) > (+)-isoprenaline (25). However, dobutamine, the beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, failed to enhance stimulus-induced overflow of noradrenaline. These results are indicative of the presence of beta 2-adrenoceptors as prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors. 4. Facilitation elicited by (-)-isoprenaline and procaterol, the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, was inhibited by ICI 118,551, the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, with pKb values of 9.20 and 9.35, respectively at renal prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors. Similarly, the pKb values of metoprolol, the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, at renal prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors were determined to be 6.25 and 6.18 against (-)-isoprenaline and procaterol, respectively. These results suggest the presence of a homogeneous population of beta 2-adrenoceptors as prejunctional beta-adrenoceptors. 5. Radio-ligand binding analysis of renal beta-adrenoceptors revealed the prevalence of the beta 1-subtype as compared to the beta 2-subtype (63% vs 37%). However, surgical denervation of the rat kidney, resulting in more than 90% reduction in renal noradrenaline content, selectively reduced the beta 2-adrenoceptor population by 80%, implying the presence of beta 2-adrenoceptors on renal sympathetic nerve terminals. 6. Autoradiographic analysis demonstrated the presence of beta 1-adrenoceptors on cortical structures such as glomeruli and tubules. beta-Adrenoceptors were found to be present on tubules (minor population), collecting tubules in outer medulla and the adventitia and adventitial-medial border of intraparenchymal branches of the renal artery. Surgical denervation of the rat kidney resulted in the disappearance of Beta2-adrenoceptors associated with the intraparenchymal branches, without affecting the Beta-adrenoceptor populations at other sites. These results support the notion that the Beta2-subtype is present on renal sympathetic nerve terminals and demonstrate that these prejunctional Beta2-adrenoceptors are associated with the renal vasculature and not with renal tubules.7. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that renal prejunctional Beta-adrenoceptors are of the Beta2-subtype in nature. These receptors are present on sympathetic nerve terminals which are associated with the renal vasculature.", 
    "6": "The impact of antihypertensive medications on the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women has rarely been systematically evaluated in large clinical trials using drugs from the new generations of pharmaceutic preparations. We carried out a multicenter, randomized double-blind clinical trial with 309 hypertensive women aged 60 to 80 years to assess effects of atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine on measures of quality of life over a 22-week period. The patients had mild to moderate hypertension. Hydrochlorothiazide was added to treatment if monotherapy was inadequate in lowering blood pressure. At the conclusion of the trial the three drug groups did not differ in degree of reduction of diastolic blood pressure or in supplementation with hydrochlorothiazide. Over the 22-week trial, linear trend analysis showed no differences between the treatment groups in change from baseline on quality of life measures of well-being, physical status, emotional status, cognitive functioning, and social role participation. Regarding each of 33 physical side effects over the 22 weeks, we found no general difference between atenolol, enalapril, and isradipine groups on measures of change in distress over symptoms except for enalapril patients who worsened in distress over cough (P = .001) and atenolol patients who worsened in distress over dry mouth (P = .014). Centering on three medications that are relatively new additions to the armamentarium for blood pressure control, the findings underline the increasing opportunities for the physician to select drugs that can control blood pressure while maintaining the quality of life of elderly hypertensive women.", 
    "7": "Rats were trained to discriminate 0.3 mg/kg (IP) flesinoxan from saline in a standard two-lever operant procedure and thereafter subjected to generalization and antagonism tests with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist ipsapirone and the beta-adrenergic/5-HT1 receptor antagonist pindolol. Ipsapirone (3.0 mg/kg) completely substituted for flesinoxan. Both the flesinoxan (0.3 mg/kg) and the ipsapirone cue (3.0 mg/kg) were dose-dependently blocked by (+/-)-pindolol. In a second group of rats, trained to discriminate 0.5 mg/kg (IP) of flesinoxan from saline, the putative 5-HT1A antagonist NAN-190 (in the dose range of 1.0 to 6.0 mg/kg) partially blocked the cue of flesinoxan. Generalization studies revealed that the flesinoxan cue could not be mimicked by NAN-190 (3.0 mg/kg). Finally, rats were pretreated with the 5-HT depletor parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and thereafter tested with the flesinoxan training dose (0.5 mg/kg). PCPA pretreatment did not significantly attenuate the recognition of the flesinoxan cue. The present results are in agreement with previous findings concerning the stimulus effect of flesinoxan and point to a mechanism that involves the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the brain. Depletion of 5-HT did not significantly affect the stimulus effect of flesinoxan, suggesting that presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors do not play a crucial role in the mechanism underlying the stimulus effect of flesinoxan.", 
    "8": "The effect of the intraperitoneally (IP) injected alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (15, 40, 130 and 537 micrograms/kg b.wt.) on feed intake and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels was studied in 12 adult female African pygmy goats. Prazosin produced a dose-dependent long-lasting hypophagia and a dose-dependent increase in plasma FFA levels. The hypophagic effect of prazosin and the elevation in plasma FFA induced by prazosin were abolished by concomitant injection of the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (500 micrograms/kg b.wt.). The hypophagic effect of prazosin (40 micrograms/kg) was also abolished by concomitant injection of the hypertonic agent angiotensin II (AII: 1 microgram/kg). The results suggest that blockade of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors by prazosin-producing hypotension elicits a counterregulatory sympathetic activation, which reduces voluntary food intake by activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. The dose dependence of the inhibition of food intake and of the elevation of plasma FFA after prazosin suggests that the hypophagia due to prazosin may be partly a consequence of elevated plasma FFA.", 
    "9": "In the present study male rat sexual behavior was used to explore the functional properties of FG 5893, a newly developed diphenylbutylpiperazinepyridyl derivative which is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. Treatment with FG 5893 (0.1-6.0 mg kg-1) stimulated male rat sexual behavior, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of mounts and intromissions to elicit ejaculation, and a shortening of the ejaculation latency. The stimulatory effects varied in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum at 3.0 mg kg-1. Pretreatment with (+/-)-pindolol (0.5 mg kg-1 -30 min), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, completely antagonized the stimulatory effects of FG 5893 (1 mg kg-1 -20 min) on male sexual behavior. In addition, the behavioral action of FG 5893 was investigated on various components of the 'serotonin behavior syndrome' including flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower lip retraction. The effects obtained were compared with those induced by treatment with 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the prototype of a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Compared to 8-OH-DPAT, a 100 times higher dose of FG 5893 (10 mg kg-1) was needed to elicit flat body posture while forepaw treading was never seen. Lower lip retraction was elicited by the lowest doses of FG 5893 (0.1 mg kg-1) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.03 mg kg-1). Treatment with (+/-)-pindolol reduced flat body posture elicited by 8-OH-DPAT and completely eradicated the flat body posture induced by FG 5893.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "We studied the role of the L-arginine-nitric oxide (NO) pathway in non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxation of the rabbit sphincter of Oddi by recording changes in isometric tension in response to electrical field stimulation in two series of experiments. In a first set of experiments, biliary sphincters of Oddi removed from New Zealand white rabbits were placed horizontally in an organ bath containing oxygenized, buffered (pH 7.4) Krebs solution. Contractile responses of the whole sphincter to field stimulation were determined. In the second set of experiments, sphincter of Oddi was divided into two parts and the effects of field stimulation were studied separately on areas close to the duodenal papilla (area I) and areas close to the common bile duct (area II). In the whole sphincter of Oddi, field stimulation induced an initial twitch-like contraction followed by relaxation proportional to the number of stimuli (3 and 10 stimuli at 20 Hz, 50 V, 0.1 ms). The magnitude of the contractile responses was considerably reduced by 1 microM atropine, phentolamine and oxprenolol (NANC solution). Field stimulation produced dose-dependent contractions of both segments of sphincter of Oddi in response to the same protocol as used with whole sphincter of Oddi. However, preincubation with NANC solution produced monophasic relaxations in response to field stimulation in area I, whereas area II preparations such as the whole sphincter of Oddi responded with contractions followed by minimal relaxations. Field stimulation failed to induce either contractions or relaxations in the presence of 1 microM tetrodotoxin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Hypertension and cerebral hyperperfusion are often seen in the immediate postoperative period after craniotomy for supratentorial tumours. Metoprolol is known to attenuate the postoperative hypertensive response after hypotensive anaesthesia and this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of metoprolol on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) before extubation and cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (AVDO2), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), PaO2 and PaCO2 in a 180-min period after extubation. Twenty patients anaesthetized with thiopentone, fentanyl, nitrous oxide 67%, and halothane 0.5% were randomized to receive intravenous metoprolol or placebo at the end of the peroperative period. There were no significant differences in CBF- and CMRO2 values between the two groups. In the period between closure of the dura and 5 min after extubation, an increase in MABP was observed in the control group (P < 0.05), but not in the metoprolol group. During the same period a decrease in AVDO2 was observed in both groups (P < 0.05); during the next 10 min an increase was observed, but with no difference in AVDO2 values between the groups. A higher level of PaO2 in the metoprolol group was observed in the postoperative period. These findings suggest that peroperative treatment with metoprolol reduces postoperative MABP but does not influence the cerebral blood flow and metabolism.", 
    "12": "Heart rate variability (HRV) as determined from 24-h Holter recordings is being recognized as a measure of cardiac autonomic control. In patients surviving myocardial infarction HRV has been established as a useful tool for risk-stratification. The effects of antiarrhythmic agents on HRV, however, have not been extensively studied. The present study therefore examined time- and frequency-domain measures of HRV in 28 patients (10 females, 18 males at a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years) with symptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias (> 30 VPB/h plus repetitive arrhythmias) before and during treatment with sotalol, a beta-receptor blocking agent with class-III antiarrhythmic activity. Heart rate variability before treatment was independent of the density of spontaneous arrhythmias. Therapy with sotalol resulted in a significant improvement in indices of vagal tone compared to baseline (SDNN 113 +/- 45 vs. 99 +/- 43 ms (p = .05); rMSSD 39 +/- 23 vs. 30 +/- 17 ms (p = .009); pNN50 11.4 +/- 12.5 vs. 6.8 +/- 9.5% (p = .005); HF 13 +/- 7 vs. 11 +/- 7 (p = .048). This improvement was particularly evident in patients with reduced left ventricular function (LVEF < 40%) and was independent of therapy-induced changes in mean heart rate (pNN50 vs. Mean NN r = 0.37; n.s.) or suppression of ventricular arrhythmias (pNN50 vs. In VES/24 h r = 0.41; n.s.). These effects on heart rate variability and thus on cardiac autonomic tone may contribute significantly to the antifibrillatory efficacy profile of sotalol.", 
    "13": "The effects of nebivolol, a new beta-blocker with vasodilating properties, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as monotherapies and in combination on BP and plasma lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were compared with placebo in a parallel 3 x 4 factorial design study. After an eight week wash-out period, 240 patients with primary hypertension were randomised to receive either placebo, nebivolol 1, 5 or 10 mg, HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg or one of the six possible combinations of nebivolol and HCTZ. Twenty patients were assigned to each of the 12 parallel groups. After 12 weeks of treatment, there was a significant dose-related reduction in BP among all active treatment groups. Apart from a slight and isolated increase in triglycerides with HCTZ 12.5 mg, lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein levels as well as lipoprotein and apolipoprotein ratios were not significantly modified by 12 week active treatments when compared with placebo treatment. The results of this multifactorial study with 12 small sample size groups, suggest that nebivolol as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ does not cause deleterious effects on the lipid profile.", 
    "14": "The newly developed antihypertensive drugs, the long-acting beta-blocker propranolol and the sustained release calcium antagonist verapamil, are compared in their antihypertensive, platelet function, rheological properties and metabolic effects. The trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Thirty patients with mild to moderate hypertension received propranolol (40-120 mg) or verapamil (80-200 mg) once daily in two separate ten week courses. After ten weeks treatment both drugs had significantly reduced both SBP and DBP. Beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG) concentration, reflecting the status of platelet activation in vivo, was significantly decreased after propranolol (129.6 +/- 13.5 vs. 77.9 +/- 8.6 ng/ml) and verapamil (129.6 +/- 13.5 vs. 90.7 +/- 10.1 ng/ml) treatments while platelet aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, arachidonic acid or adrenaline and the production of thromboxane B2 (TXB2), 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and platelet cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate (C-AMP) concentration were not affected. Significant alterations in rheological parameters such as plasma and whole blood viscosity, fibrinogen level and red cell deformability were not found. Higher cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were observed after propranolol treatment but not in verapamil treatment. Side-effects were mild, tolerated and no patient had to be withdrawn from the study. In conclusion, propranolol and verapamil are generally effective antihypertensive as well as rheologically safe drugs. Compared with the metabolic effect on serum lipid, verapamil may be a better choice. Both drugs possess the tendency to inhibit platelet properties which is desirable in hypertension treatment.", 
    "15": "The present study investigated the contribution of adrenergic beta 1-receptor stimulation to the cardiovascular and renal effects of low-dose dopamine in eight normal, water-loaded humans. Metoprolol (100 mg) or placebo was administered orally at 08.00 h in a randomized, double-blind fashion on two different days. Renal clearance studies were performed during a 1 h baseline period, two 1 h periods with dopamine infusion (3 micrograms kg-1 min-1), and a 1 h recovery period. Cardiac output was measured by an ultrasonic Doppler method, and lithium clearance (CLLi) was used to estimate proximal tubular outflow. Baseline values of heart rate, systolic pressure and mean arterial pressure decreased with metoprolol compared with placebo, but cardiac output, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were not significantly changed. Metoprolol significantly decreased baseline CLLi and sodium clearance (CLNa) by 19% (P < 0.01) and 34% (P < 0.01), respectively. Metoprolol blunted the dopamine-induced increases in heart rate and systolic pressure, but cardiac output increased to the same extent on both study days by 26% (placebo, P < 0.05) and by 31% (metoprolol, P < 0.01), respectively. With and without metoprolol, dopamine did not significantly change GFR, and the percentage increases in ERPF were similar on the two study days (40% (P < 0.001) and 42% (P < 0.001), respectively). Dopamine increased CLLi and CLNa by 31% (P < 0.01) and 114% (P < 0.01), respectively, with placebo, and by 36% (P < 0.01) and 114% (P < 0.01), respectively, with metoprolol. Values during infusion remained significantly lower with metoprolol compared with placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Xenopus laevis oocytes are a powerful tool for the characterization of signal transduction pathways leading to the induction of DNA synthesis. Since activation of PLA2, PLC, or PLD has been postulated as a mediator of ras function, we have used the oocyte system to study the putative functional relationship between ras-p21 and these phospholipases. A rapid generation of PA and DAG was observed after ras-p21 microinjection, suggesting the activation of both PLC and PLD enzymes. However, production of DAG was sensitive to inhibition of the PA-hydrolase by propranolol, indicating that PLD is the enzyme responsible for the generation of both PA and DAG. Microinjection of PLD or ras-p21 induced the late production of lysophosphatidylcholine on a p42MAPK-dependent manner, an indication of the activation of a PLA2. Inhibition of this enzyme by quinacrine does not inhibit PLD- or ras-induced GVBD, suggesting that PLA2 activation is not needed for ras or PLD function. Contrary to 3T3 fibroblasts, where ras-p21 is functionally dependent for its mitogenic activity on TPA- and staurosporine-sensitive PKC isoforms, in Xenopus oocytes, induction of GVBD by ras-p21 was independent of PKC, while PLC-induced GVBD was sensitive to PKC inhibition. Thus, our results demonstrate the activation of PLD and PLA2 by ras-p21 proteins, while no effect on PLC was observed.", 
    "17": "The effects of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol (CAS 525-66-6) and the cardioselective drug atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7) on serum glucose, insulin levels and some serum lipid components, were compared in normal and diabetic rats receiving glibenclamide. The two beta-blockers, when administered concurrently with glibenclamide in normal rats, exerted a significant hypoglycemic effect (p < 0.01), while in diabetic rats the two drugs caused a more significant decrease (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, resp.). Serum insulin levels were mainly unaffected by the two beta-blockers. Propranolol was found to exhibit a hypolipidemic effect in diabetic rats when administered alone or in combination with glibenclamide. In comparison atenolol, when used alone, exerted a significant increase in triglycerides and total lipid levels (p < 0.05) in normal rats. This effect was masked when atenolol was administered concurrently with glibenclamide, but a hypercholesterolemic effect (p < 0.01) was noticed. Paradoxically in diabetic rats, atenolol caused a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in triglycerides level, while its combined use with glibenclamide showed no effect.", 
    "18": "Idiopathic long q-t syndrome (LQTS) is an infrequently occurring familial disorder in which affected family members have an abnormally prolonged q-tc interval with syncope, ventricular arrythmias and sudden death. In this article, we present the case of a 54-year-old female admitted for syncope, who was on no medications except for insulin. Her electrocardiogram on admission had prolonged q-tc interval (0.50 ms.). She had repeated episodes of torsades de pointes during her hospitalization, which were later controlled by beta-blockers. Electrocardiograms of her mother and daughter showed asymptomatic prolonged q-tc interval. This syndrome has an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission and it was first described by Romano and Ward in a patient with normal hearing. Our case is unusual because this condition presented so late in life.", 
    "19": "Limited information exists regarding the influence of dosage-release formulation on inhibition of drug metabolism. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of immediate-release (IR) and sustained-release (SR) verapamil on the pharmacokinetic parameters of propranolol in 12 healthy men. IR propranolol, 160 mg, was administered alone (Phase A) and following either IR verapamil, 80 mg t.i.d., (Phase B) or SR verapamil, 240 mg q.d., (Phase C) in a randomized crossover fashion. Of the 12 subjects enrolled, only seven were able to be analyzed secondary to assay interference. Oral clearances for L-propranolol for Phases A, B, and C were 198 +/- 70, 156 +/- 76, and 143 +/- 85 L/h, respectively. Oral clearances for D-propranolol for Phases A, B, and C were 203 +/- 96, 172 +/- 96, and 152 +/- 102 L/h, respectively. No significant differences were observed. However, when the verapamil groups (Phase B and C) were combined and compared to Phase A, a significant decrease in clearance for propranolol isomers was observed. In conclusion, due to the unexpected low numbers of patients evaluated, no significant differences in oral clearance were observed among the three treatment phases. However, there is a trend suggesting that SR verapamil had the greatest effect on propranolol clearance, which may warrant caution when changing from one formulation to another.", 
    "20": "The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were assessed from the data of 3 experiments in which intravenous deuterated metoprolol was given concomitantly with various oral metoprolol formulations to healthy volunteers. The plasma levels after intravenous administration were well described by a biexponential equation. However, a deviation from a pure biphasic decline was observed over a short period of time, immediately after the rapid elimination phase. The inter- and intra-subject variability of the parameters describing the two-compartment model was large. The intra-subject variability of the terminal half-life and the plasma clearance was lower than their inter-subject variability. The plasma clearance was linearly related to 1/t1/2. Contrarily to the other parameters of the model, t1/2 appeared to be a characteristic of the subject.",

These modifications make the method even more adequate for population studies and clinical routine.", 
    "22": "By using acetyl strophanthidin (AS) 0.2 mumol/L, the delayed after-depolarization (DAD) was induced in sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers and recorded with intra-cellular microelectrode. When beta-adrenoceptor was blocked by propranolol 1.0 mumol/L, phenylephrine 1.0 mumol/L increased the amplitude of DAD from 8.1 +/- 2.2 mV to 9.5 +/- 2.8 mV, prolonged the duration of DAD from 240 +/- 47 ms to 273 +/- 47 ms (n = 13, P < 0.01) and increased the up rising velocity of DAD from 0.039 +/- 0.023 V/s to 0.051 +/- 0.026 V/s (n = 13, P < 0.05). The DAD occurred earlier for 30 +/- 47 ms to preceding action potential (n = 13, P < 0.05). When triggered action potentials were induced by norepinephrine 1.0 mumol/L on the basis of DAD, propranolol 1.0 mumol/L could suppress the triggered beats while phentolamine 1.8 mumol/L showed little effect. The above results indicate that excitation of alpha-receptor had only slight augmentation effect on DAD. However, for the triggered activity induced by DAD, the inhibitory effect of beta-blockers are stronger than that of alpha-blockers.", 
    "23": "Adrenergic control of swimbladder blood flow was analysed in blood-perfused preparations of the European eel as well as in situ by recording the changes in swimbladder blood flow and blood pressure following an injection of catecholamine into the dorsal artery. In blood-perfused swimbladder preparations, injection of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine into the perfusion loop caused a marked dose-dependent increase in perfusion pressure at constant flow, while injection of the beta-agonist isoproterenol slightly decreased perfusion pressure. The beta-effect was not as pronounced as the alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and was observed only during the first application of catecholamine in each preparation. In situ injection of adrenaline (final concentration 10(-8)-10(-9) mol kg-1 body mass) into the dorsal aorta caused a dose-dependent transient increase in dorsal aortic blood pressure and in cardiac output which, after 5-10 min, returned to resting levels. Swimbladder perfusion also increased initially after an injection of adrenaline, but after about 1-2 min suddenly decreased and then slowly recovered to preinjection levels. Following the injection of adrenaline into the dorsal aorta, blood pressure changes in vessels at the swimbladder pole of the rete mirabile revealed a similar biphasic pattern with an initial increase, a subsequent decrease and a slow return to preinjection levels, while pressure in the arterial influx vessel of the rete resembled dorsal aortic pressure. After injection of the beta-blocker propranolol, adrenaline evoked a smaller initial increase in blood flow, but the subsequent reduction in flow was even more pronounced. Injection, in addition, of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine abolished the sharp adrenaline-induced decrease in swimbladder perfusion. It is concluded that alpha- and beta-adrenergically controlled resistance vessels are located close to the rete mirabile, probably at the arterial entrance into the rete. These vessels control perfusion of the rete mirabile and of the swimbladder and are thus involved in the control of gas deposition into the swimbladder.",

For example, perfusion of hippocampal slices with the beta-noradrenergic agonist isoproterenol induces a long-lasting potentiation (LLP) of extracellularly recorded responses following stimulation of the medial perforant path (PP), and long-lasting depression (LLD) of responses evoked by stimulation of the lateral PP (Dahl D, Sarvey JM, 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86:4776-4780). To examine the possible interactions of LLP, LLD, and long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation (LTP), the authors recorded extracellular field potentials evoked in the DG by stimulation of the lateral or medial perforant path following LTP and LLP or LLD, invoked in different orders. After establishment of LLP or LLD by bath application of isoproterenol, subsequent tetanization of the respective afferents resulted in additional potentiation of the medial PP-evoked response and return of the lateral PP-evoked response to baseline levels. In other slices, application of isoproterenol after establishment of LTP resulted in further potentiation of medial PP-evoked responses but no change in the potentiated response evoked by lateral PP stimulation. Thus the pathway specificity was maintained irrespective of the history of previous potentiation or depression. Experiments using the specific beta 1 antagonist metoprolol further confirmed pathway specificity. Perfusion with 20 microM of metoprolol appeared to reduce LTP evoked by stimulation of the medial but not lateral PP. In a subsequent experiment, metoprolol in the absence of tetanization produced LLD of the medial PP-evoked response and LLP of the lateral PP-evoked response, opposite to the effects of ISO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The alpha-adrenergic stimulation by phenylephrine of lacrimal gland protein secretion was pharmacologically characterized. Acini, prepared from rat exorbital lacrimal glands, were incubated with agonists, antagonists or both for 0-20 min. Peroxidase secretion, an index of protein secretion, was measured spectrophotometrically. Peroxidase secretion was stimulated by the alpha 1-adrenergic agonists clonidine. The non-selective alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine completely inhibited phenylephrine-induced secretion. The selective alpha 1-adrenergic alkylating agent phenoxybenzamine and the selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin partially inhibited phenylephrine-induced secretion. The alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine, the beta-adrenergic antagonist timolol, and the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol also inhibited phenylephrine-induced secretion but were 100-fold less potent than prazosin. It is concluded that phenylephrine activates an alpha 1-adrenergic pathway, but not an alpha 2-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic or dopaminergic pathway, to stimulate lacrimal gland protein secretion from acini.", 
    "26": "Positive inotropic efficacies (maximal increase in contractile force) and potencies of the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine and beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline were determined on electrically driven (1 Hz) ventricular strips from rats aged 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 (adult) weeks. The inotropic response to methoxamine significantly decreased after 2 weeks of age. The inotropic potency of isoprenaline was slightly but significantly lower at all ages than at 0.5 weeks of age. Up to 2 weeks of age, the maximal inotropic effect of methoxamine was comparable with that of isoprenaline, thereafter it was but markedly less. Phenylephrine behaved like methoxamine, and noradrenaline like isoprenaline. The effect of methoxamine was antagonized by prazosin but not by propranolol; the reverse was true for isoprenaline. Injections at birth of triiodothyronine and dexamethasone exerted minimal effects on the inotropic responses to methoxamine and isoprenaline. Chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine caused supersensitivity to the inotropic effects of isoprenaline but produced subsensitivity to responses to methoxamine at 1 week; effects of methoxamine at 3 and 6 weeks of age were not altered by sympathectomy. No significant differences in alpha 1- or beta 1-adrenoceptor densities or affinities in ventricular membranes from 7-day-old and adult rats were found. It is concluded that the positive inotropic responses to sympathomimetic amines decline with age, the decline is most marked in the case of alpha 1-adrenoreceptor- mediated effects, and these changes do not appear to be due to a decrease in the number or affinity of alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "27": "A technique was developed for the perfusion of periaortic brown adipose tissue (BAT) with a view to assessing vascular system involvement in BAT thermogenesis. The procedure involved cannulation of the thoracic aorta and ligation of the intercostal branches and the distal thoracic aorta. Perfusion was conducted in a buffer-filled chamber using constant flow at 37 degrees C. Lactate dehydrogenase leakage was less than 2%/h, and after 30 min of perfusion the energy charge was 0.72 +/- 0.05 (n = 4) and differed little from freshly sampled interscapular BAT (0.71 +/- 0.03 (n = 7)). Periaortic BAT was indistinguishable from interscapular BAT in enzyme content, mitochondrial size, mitochondrial cristae, lipid content, and cell size. Basal oxygen consumption (VO2) was 64.3 +/- 7.4 mumol.h-1.g-1 wet weight, and basal perfusion pressure was 65 +/- 3 mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa). Norepinephrine and isoproterenol each increased VO2 of perfused periaortic BAT in a time-dependent and reversible manner. Half-maximal stimulation of VO2 occurred at 12 nM norepinephrine and 8 nM isoproterenol; maximally stimulated tissue had a VO2 of approximately 150 mumol.h-1.g-1 wet weight. Norepinephrine (50 nM) had no consistent effect on perfusion pressure, but the increase in VO2 by this agonist was completely blocked by 10 microM DL-propranolol and unaffected by phentolamine (1-20 microM) or nitroprusside (0.01-1 mM). Increasing the perfusion flow rate increased pressure and had no effect on basal VO2 but increased the VO2 response due to norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effects of the new inotropic agent, SDZ 218-135 [(+)-(S)-4-[3-(4-diphenyl-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2-hydroxy-propyl]- 6-(2-hydroxyethyl)-5-methyl-1,2,4-triazolo-[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(4H)-one], were investigated using in vitro and in vivo techniques. In isolated rat atria, SDZ 218-135 elicited a dose-dependent increase in contractile force (+50% at 10 microM), which was paralleled by an increase in functional refractory period. In anesthetized rats SDZ 218-135 enhanced left ventricular (+)dP/dtmax by 100% at 10 mg/kg without influencing heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and cardiac output. In contrast to its predecessor, DPI 201-106, cardiac relaxation remained essentially unimpaired. The positive inotropic action was also maintained in a rabbit model of depressed heart function after myocardial infarction, where SDZ 218-135 increased peak acceleration of blood in the aorta. The prolongation of the effective refractory period in rat atria suggested possible antiarrhythmic effects. Indeed, SDZ 218-135 showed a dose-dependent marked reduction in reperfusion arrhythmias after coronary artery occlusion in rats. This effect was most likely due to a Class III action, since SDZ 218-135 significantly increased action potential duration (+10% at 10 microM/l) of the isolated guinea pig papillary muscle. In conclusion, SDZ 218-135 is a novel positive inotropic agent with an interesting profile of action. It does not impair cardiac relaxation and shows antiarrhythmic effects in a model of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. The in vivo and in vitro data are consistent with a mechanism of action via sodium channel agonism.", 
    "29": "Antiischemic effects of beta 1-blocking agents are based on intrinsic negative inotropic and chronotropic properties. Partial beta 1-agonistic activity, although useful in preserving cardiac function, may counteract such antiischemic properties by modulating the intrinsic negative cardiac effects of beta-blockade. To investigate the acute hemodynamic and antiischemic profile of epanolol, a cardioselective beta 1-antagonist and partial agonist, 20 patients with left coronary artery disease underwent two incremental atrial pacing tests, 45 minutes before (APST I) and 15 minutes after (APST II) 4 mg intravenous epanolol, administered over 5 minutes. Additional measurements were carried out at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after epanolol, at basal and fixed heart rates. Epanolol immediately reduced heart rate with a maximum of 10% at 15 minutes and decreased contractility (Vmax) by 7% (both p < .05), whereas cardiac output fell temporarily by 9% (p < .05). Other hemodynamic parameters did not change, except for a significant 11% reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. Despite comparable pacing conditions, both the double product and contractility decreased significantly less during APST II, resulting in a 17% lower myocardial oxygen consumption (p < .05). Myocardial ischemia was markedly reduced, indicated by normalization of lactate metabolism [lactate extraction 16 +/- 7% vs. -7 +/- 8% (APST I)], less ST depression (21%), and modulation of LV end-diastolic pressure postpacing (all p < .05 vs. APST I), whereas angina was absent or less in 14 patients. None of the patients reported an adverse effect. Thus, under resting conditions intravenous epanolol induces moderate, short-lasting negative chronotropic and inotropic effects, but does not alter cardiac pump function or vascular resistance, reflecting its additional beta 1-agonistic properties. Alternatively, during pacing it still reduces ischemia through negative inotropic effects and diminishes myocardial oxygen demand, reflecting its beta 1-antagonistic profile.", 
    "30": "Presentation of maternal stimuli to mother- or littermate-deprived 16-day-old rat pups strengthens the transport response. Administration of varying doses of haloperidol failed to attenuate this response potentiation. In contrast, administration of varying doses of propranolol blocked response potentiation. It is proposed that under high levels of stress the potentiation of transport response is primarily under the control of beta-noradrenergic systems.", 
    "31": "Selective alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists were used to determine the action of catecholamines on fatty acid biosynthesis in freshly isolated human mononuclear leukocytes. Incubation of cells for 22 h in a lipid-free medium resulted in a 4-fold increase in the incorporation of [14C]acetate into fatty acids. Addition of (-)-epinephrine in increasing concentrations to the incubation medium inhibited the rate of fatty acid synthesis by 42% at a concentration of 0.1 M. Similar effects were observed using (-)-norepinephrine and the beta-agonist isoproterenol. The catecholamine action was diminished by the unselective beta-blocker propranolol and mimicked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Since human mononuclear leukocytes possess beta 2-, but not beta 1-adrenoceptors (Brodde, Engel and Hoyer 1981), catecholamines may act via beta-adrenergic receptors of the beta 2-subtype. In addition, it appears that stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors inhibits fatty acid synthesis, too. In the presence of a beta-blockade by 1 microM propranolol, the alpha 2-agonist alpha-methylnorepinephrine, but not the alpha 1-agonist phenylephrine inhibited fatty acid synthesis rate. Accordingly, the epinephrine effect was attenuated by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine, but not by the alpha 1-antagonist prazosin. The results provide evidence that catecholamines may inhibit the synthesis rate of fatty acids by stimulation of both, beta 2- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "32": "The aim of these studies was to investigate the mechanism underlying the haemodynamic changes associated with brain death. The initial series of studies were to assess whether these changes involved some blood-borne factor. When control rats (n = 6) were exsanguinated whilst being simultaneously transfused with blood from rats that had been brain-dead for 60 min, their haemodynamic function did not deteriorate. Likewise, when brain-dead rats (n = 6) were exsanguinated and transfused with blood from control rats there was no improvement of haemodynamic function. The absence of any blood-borne factor was further confirmed in studies in which isolated hearts from control rats were perfused with blood from a support rat which had been brain-dead for 15 min (n = 6/group). The brain-death-induced haemodynamic changes in the support rat (mean arterial pressure increased from 98 +/- 6 to 176 +/- 9 mm Hg after 30 s and then fell to 44 +/- 5 mm Hg after 5 min) were not associated with changes in cardiac function of the perfused heart (left ventricular developed pressure was 146 +/- 4 mmHg before the induction of brain death and 147 +/- 4 and 151 +/- 7 mm Hg at 30 s and 5 min, respectively, after the induction). In further in vivo studies, we assessed the involvement of the autonomic nervous system in brain-death-induced haemodynamic instability. We achieved this by employing beta-adrenoreceptor blockade or bilateral vagotomy (n = 6/group); propranolol (1 mg/kg given as a bolus 6 min before brain death followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h continuous infusion) abolished the early transient tachycardia and positive inotropic response to brain death but did not alter the subsequent deterioration of function (mean arterial pressure fell from 75 +/- 7 mmHg before brain death to 49 +/- 5 mmHg after 30 min). Bilateral vagotomy had no effect on the functional changes induced by brain death. The effect of catecholamine depletion was then investigated; 6-hydroxydopamine (given over 15 days) depleted myocardial norepinephrine content by approximately 90% (from 2.3 +/- 0.1 to 0.3 +/- 0.1 nmol/g wet wt; P < 0.05). Depletion of cardiac catecholamines reduced brain-death-induced mortality to zero but did not affect cardiac dysfunction. Finally, we used L-NAME and naloxone in an attempt to identify roles for nitric oxide and endogenous opioid peptides but were again unable to influence the cardiac events. In conclusion, the initial transient hyperdynamic response induced by brain death appears to be mediated through cardiac innervation and can be inhibited by beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. However, the autonomic nervous system, nitric oxide, endogenous opioid peptides and blood-borne factors do not appear to be involved in the subsequent deterioration of cardiac function.", 
    "33": "In patient and experimental models of regions of the left ventricle subjected to ischaemia and thus made dysfunctional it is important to characterize the inotropic state of the remaining myocardium. Eighteen pentobarbitone-anaesthetized open-chest cats with an acute circumflex coronary artery occlusion were therefore studied during either sympathetic nerve stimulation (n = 9), or after beta-adrenergic blockade (n = 9). Myocardial contractility was evaluated from cross-oriented segments in the left ventricular anterior wall during stable haemodynamics and during 5 s inferior caval occlusion. The end-systolic pressure-length relationship of longitudinal segments was rather insensitive to beta-adrenergic blockade and sympathetic nerve stimulation. The end-systolic pressure-length relationship of circumferential segments was suitable as a marker of contractility in the low contractility range, whereas the peak systolic shortening velocity parameter was more suitable in the upper contractility range. The pressure-length loop area versus end-diastolic length relationship of both circumferential and longitudinal segments reflected both increased and decreased left ventricular inotropic state. We therefore conclude that the pressure-length loop area versus end-diastolic length relationship is the best index of regional myocardial contractility in regional ischaemic hearts.", 
    "34": "Previous studies in other systems have shown that beta-receptor blockers may effectively inhibit oxygen radical-induced lipid peroxidation. On the other hand, it has been recently proposed that oxygen free radicals can induce peroxidation of human low density lipoproteins (LDL), and that peroxidized LDL may be an atherogenic stimulus. Chemically modified LDL are internalized by macrophages via a specific cell surface receptor that was termed the scavenger receptor. This phenomenon may induce foam cells transformation in vivo. In the present study we investigated whether beta-blockers may reduce oxygen radical-mediated LDL peroxidation. Purified human LDL were oxidized by exposure to oxygen free radicals generated by xanthine (0.2 mM) and xanthine oxidase (100 mU) at 37 degrees C after a pre-incubation (30 min) in presence of different concentrations (from 1 to 30 microM) of acebutolol, metoprolol or propranolol, three agents with a different degree of lipophilicity. Peroxidation was measured from malonyldihaldehyde (MDA) production. Data have shown a significant percent inhibition of MDA formation in presence of beta-blockers (from 33 to 85%). Thus, beta-blockers reduced peroxidation of human LDL in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. The order of potency appears to follow the degree of lipophilicity. These data suggest that, although beta-blockers are known to adversely effect lipid metabolism, these agents might on the other hand prevent atherogenesis via a mechanism of inhibition of LDL peroxidation in vivo and reduced foam cells formation.", 
    "35": "Adipocytes from genetically obese (ob/ob) mice display an impaired response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, but the molecular defects have not been unequivocally identified. The expression and functional activity of the beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes in white and brown adipose tissue from genetically lean and obese (ob/ob) mice were compared. Three beta 3AR transcripts of 2.1, 2.6, and 3.5 kilobases were identified in adipose tissue from lean mice by Northern blotting. All three beta 3AR mRNA species were dramatically reduced (by approximately 300-fold) in 12-week-old obese mice compared to those in lean animals. beta 1AR mRNA levels were also reduced (by approximately 4-fold) in obese mice, whereas beta 2AR mRNA levels were not significantly changed. The functional consequences of these changes in beta 3AR and beta 1AR expression were assessed by measuring beta-agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in adipocyte plasma membranes with subtype-selective beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. Dose-response curves with epinephrine from lean mice were best fit to a two-component model comprised of 23% high affinity (K(act) = 1.42 x 10(-7) M) and 77% low affinity (K(act) = 1.67 x 10(-5) M) components, corresponding to activation of beta 1AR and beta 2AR conjointly, and beta 3AR, respectively. The beta 1AR-selective antagonist CGP20712A reduced the high affinity component to about 10%, whereas the nonselective beta-antagonist propranolol eliminated the high affinity component. The beta 3AR-selective agonist BRL37344 stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in lean membranes to a slightly lesser extent than epinephrine, but was more potent (73% high affinity component; K(act) = 3.61 x 10(-8) M). In obese mice, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by all agonists was severely blunted and was best fit to a single class of sites. Studies with CGP20712A or the beta 2AR-selective antagonist ICI118,551 indicated that this residual response was predominantly beta 2AR in character. Expression of beta AR subtypes in both brown and white adipose tissue of weanling obese mice (4-5-weeks of age) was also affected, but to a lesser extent, consistent with the progressive severity of obesity with age. Together the reduction in expression of the beta 3AR and beta 1AR impairs the beta-agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase response over a broad concentration range by greatly lowering the maximum stimulation and shifting the adrenergic sensitivity at low concentrations from a mixed beta 1AR/beta 2AR response to predominantly beta 2AR.", 
    "36": "In patients with cirrhosis, both beta-blockers and diuretics decrease the degree of portal hypertension. Since their mechanisms of action differ, the combination of these two substances should induce a more pronounced effect on portal pressure than one of these substances alone. Thus, the hemodynamic effects of furosemide were evaluated in ten patients with cirrhosis receiving beta-blockers. One hour after furosemide (0.75 mg/kg intravenously) administration, cardiac output decreased significantly from 6.2 +/- 0.6 to 5.2 +/- 0.3 l/min and blood volume from 8.0 +/- 1.6 to 5.3 +/- 0.5 l. Mean arterial pressure was not affected. Wedged and free hepatic venous pressures did not change significantly; nor did the hepatic venous pressure gradient (19.6 +/- 1.7 to 18.6 +/- 1.5 mmHg). Azygos blood flow was not affected (0.46 +/- 0.05 to 0.50 +/- 0.07 l/min). In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate that the addition of furosemide to propranolol further decreased portal pressure in patients with cirrhosis. The long-term effects of this combination are unknown and should be tested.", 
    "37": "A high performance liquid chromatographic method with internal analog standardization for the quantification of propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone enantiomers in human plasma is described. The method comprises extraction from alkalinized plasma into a toluene/diethylether phase (9:1), separation of the optical antipodes on a silica gel column using N-tert-Boc-(L)-proline as the chiral additive to the mobile phase and UV detection. A detection limit of 10 pmol/assay was established for the propafenone enantiomers, whereas for the optical antipodes of 5-hydroxypropafenone the limit was around 50 pmol/assay. Under routine conditions the limit of quantification (variation coefficient 15%) for the propafenone enantiomers is about 13 pmol/assay and for the 5-hydroxypropafenone enantiomers it is 66 pmol/assay. The determination method for the enantiomers is not impaired by the other metabolites. The suitability of the method for human pharmacology studies is demonstrated with samples obtained from healthy subjects.", 
    "38": "The present investigation compared the pattern of substrate utilization during prolonged walking in obese women with upper (UB) and lower (LB) body fat patterns and the effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on that response. Twenty healthy, premenopausal, obese volunteers (% fat > or = 30%) were characterized by waist-to-hip (WHR) circumference ratios into two distinct groups (UB: WHR > or = 0.85, LB: WHR < or = 0.75). The groups (n = 10 each) were similar for BMI, age, % fat, and maximal aerobic power (VO2max). Subjects participated in two 60-min walk bouts at 55-60% VO2max. The trials (placebo (C) and 80 mg propranolol (PR)) were performed in random order, 110 min after ingestion, with 2-4 days between tests. Open-circuit spirometry was employed to calculate the VO2, VCO2 and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at 10 min intervals. A significant (P < 0.0001) decline in RER with time was evident in both trials. However, no group differences existed in RER values during either the C trial (RER range = 0.81-0.88) or the PR trial (RER range = 0.86-0.91). The PR trial induced a 23% reduction in the amount of calories utilized as fat compared to C in both WHR groups. Both groups of women showed equal capabilities for performing prolonged exercise with typical and appropriate metabolic shift in fuel mobilization from carbohydrate to fat. Despite the well-defined differences in metabolic activity of adipose cells shown in vitro, this study indicates that women with significantly different regions of adipose tissue stores have similar physiological potentials for substrate use during exercise.", 
    "39": "A negative calcium balance has previously been described in human hypertension with low levels of plasma ionized calcium (Ca2+) and an increased urinary excretion of calcium. The cause of this disturbance in mineral metabolism is not known, nor is it known if this derangement could be abolished if blood pressure is reduced by antihypertensive treatment. In the present investigation, the effects of antihypertensive monotherapy on serum and fasting urinary electrolytes were studied. For 3 to 6 months, 319 hypertensive patients entered 17 study groups, each group using one of the following antihypertensive drugs: dilevalol, metoprolol, antenolol, pindolol, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, bendrofluomethiazide, furosemide, spironolactone, doxazocine, prazocine, diltiazem, verapamil, nifedipine, isradipine, captopril, or lisinopril. Treatment with different beta-blockers, as well as diuretics, reduced the fasting urinary calcium excretion (P < .001). However, while the beta-blockers increased the proportion of the ionized form of calcium in blood (Ca2+) (P < .001), Ca2+ was further decreased by diuretic treatment (P < .05). Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors caused no major changes in mineral metabolism while of the calcium antagonists studied only verapamil raised the levels of Ca2+ (P < .01). No significant relationship between the changes in mineral metabolism and the reduction in blood pressure was observed in any of the treatment groups. Of the antihypertensive drugs used in the present study, beta-blockers appeared to reverse the basic abnormality with regard to calcium balance, suggesting that the activity of the sympathetic nerve system is involved in the disturbed calcium metabolism seen in hypertensive patients.", 
    "40": "Using the conflict drinking test as a model, we studied in rats the effect of the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers pindolol and cyanopindolol which bind to 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, and of the selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists betaxolol and ICI 118,551, respectively, which have a negligible affinity for 5-HT receptors. Both pindolol (2.0-8.0 mg/kg) and cyanopindolol (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) showed an anticonflict effect, having dose dependently increased the number of punished licks. On the other hand, neither betaxolol nor ICI 118,551--administered separately or in combination--affected the punished responding. The anticonflict effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol were completely abolished by the 5-HT1A receptor and alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phtalimmido)butyl]piperazine (NAN-190), but were not modified by the selective alpha 1(-)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. The effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol were also not modified in animals with lesions of 5-HT neurons, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (PCA). Moreover, it was also found that the anticonflict effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol in PCA-pretreated rats were antagonized by NAN-190 but not prazosin. Our results indicate that the anticonflict effects of pindolol and cyanopindolol depend on their agonist action on postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.",

The objectives of treatment are relief of symptoms, prevention of complications and a smooth transition into a long-term rehabilitation programme. Recently, progress has been made in the clinical management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome through standardization of the assessment using the CIWA-A scale and frequent monitoring of clinical findings, recognition of the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions (i.e. standardized supportive care) and simplification of pharmacotherapy by optimizing the use of long-acting benzodiadepines via a loading dose technique. Benzodiazepines, because of their cross-tolerance with ethanol, wide margin of safety and low potential for physical dependence and tolerance, are very effective and are the drugs of choice for the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "42": "The objective of this study was to analyse predictive factors for the development of diabetes mellitus during long-term treatment of hypertension and to compare the diabetogenic potential of thiazide diuretics and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockers. The study population comprised 686 hypertensive men, aged 47-54 years, who were followed for 15 years. Patients were treated with either thiazide diuretics or beta-adrenoceptor blockers as monotherapy or in combination with one another or alternative other antihypertensive drugs. During the first part of the study, i.e. during the 1970s, only non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockers were used. The average yearly incidence of the development of diabetes mellitus during follow-up was 1.3%. In univariate analysis body mass index, serum triglyceride level, radiographic heart enlargement and beta-blocker therapy were significantly associated with the development of diabetes mellitus. Predictors selected by stepwise Cox regression were body mass index, radiological heart enlargement and beta-blocker therapy. Two subgroups with patients treated with nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers but not with thiazide diuretics during the first five years of follow-up (the beta-blocker group; n = 93) or with thiazide diuretics but not with nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers during the first five years of follow-up (the thiazide-group; n = 96) were identified. The relative risk for developing diabetes mellitus was significantly higher in the beta-blocker group being 6.1 after 10 years and 3.5 after 15 years treatment in comparison with the thiazide group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Recent evidence has demonstrated that neurogenic vascular headaches are a combination of neurological primary events and secondary vasomotor changes. The neurological events involve the hypothalamus and sensory cortex with sympathetic hypofunction and noradrenergic abnormalities. A platelet theory has been proposed but has not really been confirmed as a legitimate cause of the neurogenic vascular headaches. Food and chemicals in foods can act as a precipitating factor in the food-sensitive neurogenic vascular headache patient. In these patients evidence is now being demonstrated to confirm this, but larger patient studies are needed. The food-sensitive migraine patient and cluster headache patient must give a good history and food diary to go along with active challenges and provocative testing in order to determine the causative foods. Any concomitant allergies of inhalants or environmentals must also be treated. The treatment modalities of elimination and rotation diets or provocation neutralization may successfully control the headaches without the need for continuous medications.",

Eight normal males received single oral doses of BRL35135 8 mg (BRL) or the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol 8 mg (SAL), after pretreatment with either placebo (PL), bisoprolol 5 mg (B5) as a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, or nadolol 20 mg (N20) to block beta 1- and beta 2- but not beta 3-receptors. Both BRL and SAL produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in keeping with beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation, and this response was totally abolished by pretreatment with N20. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and Doppler stroke distance occurred with BRL and SAL which were unaffected by pretreatment with B5 and completely blocked by N20, in keeping with beta 2-mediated effects. BRL and SAL produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses which were unaffected by beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. However, whereas N20 blocked these responses to SAL, a small but significant response occurred with BRL in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing beta 2-mediated effects. Compared with PL, the mean responses to N20/BRL, and the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4 beats min-1 [3.2 to 11.6] (P = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3] (P = 0.02) for minute distance responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Studies have shown that regular exercise may contribute to a lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The extent of the blood pressure reduction, however, appears to be limited and will in most cases be insufficient to normalize blood pressure in these patients. Therefore, many of the physically active hypertensive patients will be treated with antihypertensive agents. Treatment of physically active patients with uncomplicated hypertension with beta-blocking agents has disadvantages, since these agents reduce exercise capacity and may affect trainability in a negative way. beta 1-Selective blockers have less pronounced effects than beta 1+2-blockers and may be acceptable for some patients. In patients with very high systolic blood pressures during exercise and those with impaired oxygen delivery to the heart during exercise beta 1-selective blockers may have advantages over other antihypertensive agents, since they very effectively reduce systolic blood pressure and heart rate during exercise.",

It is a late manifestation of a multifactorial, multisystem disease, initiated very early in pregnancy, the features of which suggest an inadequate maternal response to pregnancy. There is a genetic susceptibility to pre-eclampsia. Endothelial cell dysfunction in response to an unknown factor(s) may evoke some of the hormonal anomalies. In established severe disease there is volume contraction, reduced cardiac output, enhanced vascular reactivity, platelet exhaustion and disseminated intravascular coagulation in addition to the hypertension. Delivery is associated with resolution of the hypertension. Pharmacological treatment is most suitable for early-onset, severe disease when an attempt to delay delivery is indicated. Methyldopa or beta-blockers and/or vasodilators may be used. ACE inhibitors are contra-indicated. Low-dose aspirin may be useful in prophylaxis.",

Forty cases of RAS were treated exclusively by antihypertensive drugs. A good result was obtained in 82.5% of cases. Thirty three transluminal angioplasties (TLA) were performed in 23 children with 26 RAS. A good clinical result was obtained in 15 children with a total of 17 stenoses, corresponding to a success rate of 65%. Transluminal dilatation of anastomotic stenoses always failed. There were no cases of transplant thrombosis. Eleven RAS were operated, including 5 after failure of TLA. Eight patients (73%) obtained a clinical improvement. There were 2 postoperative thromboses. Antihypertensive treatment must be administered in every case. If medical treatment fails, and with the exception of anastomotic stenoses, TLA should be the first-line procedure, while surgery is reserved for failures of TLA and for anastomotic stenoses.", 
    "48": "Beta-adrenergic blockade has been a mainstay in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction for nearly two decades. Clearly, it has withstood the test of time. The emergence of thrombolytic therapy, however, has shifted the medical community's focus, raising questions as to the benefit of beta-adrenergic blockade. Although further investigation is warranted, the available evidence suggests that beta blockers can be given safely to selected patients following coronary thrombolysis, particularly in the absence of moderate to severe left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "49": "Based on the foregoing data it is not unreasonable to hypothesize that restoration of flow in the infarct-related artery at a later date might decrease mortality. If that is the case, then a strong argument can be made for coronary angiography in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction. Of course, the ideal way to investigate this problem is to perform a large-scale prospective trial in which patients who have an occluded infarct-related artery are randomized to a revascularization procedure or continued on nonsurgical therapy. The specific management strategy for the patient with an occluded infarct-related artery after myocardial infarction depends on several features that the patient exhibits. For example, the presence or absence of LV dilatation, arrhythmias, recurrent ischemia, or clinical heart failure may dictate one form of therapy or another. There is no generic postinfarction patient with an infarct-related artery occlusion. Choices of drugs to use in these patients include the vasodilators, such as nitrates and ACE inhibitors, as well as aspirin and beta blockers. The use of calcium antagonists, chronic anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics should have specific indications. Antithrombin agents are still experimental.", 
    "50": "Previous studies reach conflicting conclusions regarding the presence of physiologically significant sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) in conscious rats with transection of the cervical spinal cord (CST). The objective of the current study was to determine whether either spinally generated SNA or nonspecific effects of antagonists are responsible for the natriuresis and decreased heart rate that accompany adrenergic blockade in CST rats. To test the first possibility, adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine and propranolol) were administered to three groups of CST rats: 1) renal denervated, 2) adrenalectomized or sham-adrenalectomized, and 3) rats who received the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium. Neither renal denervation, adrenalectomy, nor ganglionic blockade prevented either the three- to fivefold increase in sodium excretion or the 25-50 beats/min decrease in heart rate previously reported. We then administered combinations of different adrenergic antagonists to CST rats to test for nonspecific effects of the drugs. Whereas idazoxan+propranolol reproduced the natriuresis seen with phentolamine+propranolol, prazosin+yohimbine+propranolol did not. We conclude that there is no evidence for functionally significant spinally generated SNA in conscious CST rats and that the natriuresis observed with phentolamine administration is due to imidazoline binding.", 
    "51": "Cocaine-induced increases in catecholamines and the resulting enhanced activation of myocardial adrenergic receptors could contribute significantly to the formation of ventricular fibrillation (VF). In order to test this hypothesis, a 2-min coronary occlusion was initiated during the last minute of exercise in instrumented mongrel dogs. Forty-one animals were selected in which this test failed to provoke ventricular arrhythmias. The test was repeated after cocaine HCl (1.0 mg/kg). Cocaine significantly (P < .01) increased heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure and positive left ventricular dP/dt, as well as elicited VF in 34 animals. The cocaine exercise plus ischemia test was repeated in animals after pretreatment with either the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol HCl (1.0 mg/kg, n = 14) or the alpha adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin HCl (0.5 mg/kg, n = 15). Both propranolol and prazosin reduced the hemodynamic effects of cocaine and prevented VF in 12 of 14 and 12 of 15 animals, respectively. The studies were then repeated with heart rate matched to the cocaine heart rate by ventricular pacing. Prazosin (n = 5) but not propranolol (n = 4) still prevented VF even with heart rate held constant. Finally, the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor subtype antagonist WB4101 (2.0 mg/kg, n = 10) also prevented cocaine VF in 7 of 10 animals without changing heart rate. In contrast, the alpha-1B adrenergic receptor antagonist chloroethylclonidine (2.0 mg/kg, n = 3) failed to prevent VF. Thus, alpha but not beta adrenergic receptor antagonists can prevent cocaine-induced malignant arrhythmias independently of their action on heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "A conditioned emotional response paradigm was established to determine the roles of adrenergic and nonadrenergic neurotransmitters in the hemodynamic responses during stress in conscious rats. The alpha adrenoceptor antagonists, prazosin (alpha-1-selective) or phentolamine (nonselective), blocked the stress-induced increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP), but not the increase in iliac blood flow or the decrease in iliac vascular resistance. Stress-induced iliac dilation was eliminated by the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol. In rats treated with prazosin plus sotalol, stress increased MAP but did not alter iliac vascular resistance. In contrast, stress did not increase MAP after complete adrenergic blockade with phentolamine plus sotalol yet did decrease iliac vascular resistance. Bilateral adrenal demedullation (ADM) did not affect the hemodynamic responses during stress, but ganglionic blockade eliminated them in both intact rats and in rats subjected to ADM. The stress-induced vasodilation in rats with ADM was not altered by sotalol, in direct contrast to intact rats. Finally, in rats with ADM, neither atropine nor sotalol (individually or when combined) altered any of the hemodynamic responses elicited by stress. The data suggest that during a conditioned emotional response: 1) adrenal catecholamines are not critical to the hemodynamic responses; 2) the increase in MAP is mediated by alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor activation and 3) most critically, the hindquarter vasodilation is mediated by the release of neural adrenergic and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic factors.",

On the surface electrocardiogram, the diagnosis is suggested by the absence of P waves during tachycardia or very discrete P waves immediately after the QRS or an rSr' pattern in lead VI. Electrophysiologically, it can be reproducibly initiated or terminated by cardiac pacing. The reentrant circuit is limited to the atrioventricular node and a small amount of perinodal atrial tissue. Acute termination of tachycardia can be achieved by vagal manoeuvres or drugs. Adenosine compounds are excellent drugs, as are calcium channel blockers, for acute termination of the arrhythmia.

Although beta-adrenergic blockade is known to have beneficial effects during acute ischemia, its anti-arrhythmic efficacy during post-infarction ischemia is not known. To explore this question, we have used a model with a relatively high incidence of ischemic arrhythmias. Mongrel dogs 2 to 3 years of age were studied intact under anesthesia. An irreversible injury of the infero-posterior myocardium was produced with an electrode catheter 1 week earlier. The arrhythmic response to acute ischemia was assessed using serial, transient 15-minute occlusions of the left-anterior descending coronary artery with a balloon catheter. During ischemia alone, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation in animals who underwent all phases of the study was 6 of 9; with atenolol (0.2 mg/kg intravenously) and ischemia, 1 of 9 (p < 0.05). To assess the role of the bradycardic response, the latter was repeated 1 week subsequently during atrial pacing at the heart rate that existed before ischemia. Fibrillation occurred in 8 of 9, a significant reversal of the therapeutic effect. To exclude the potential artifact of a fixed intervention protocol, a study was undertaken with the short-acting esmolol, in which three ischemic periods were alternated at 1-hour intervals: (A) ischemia without treatment, (B) ischemia with continuous infusion of 150 micrograms/kg/min esmolol, and (C) same as B except that heart rate was maintained by atrial pacing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Intravenous injection of these propanolamine derivatives (1 mg/kg) in normotensive Wistar rats induced a transient fall in blood pressure but significantly reduced the heart rate for more than 30 min. These derivatives (10(-8)-10(-6) M) inhibited isoproterenol (10(-10)-10(-5) M)-induced positive chronotropic and inotropic effects in isolated guinea pig atrium. On the other hand, these derivatives (10(-5)-10(-4) M) exhibited a positive cardiotonic effect that is independent of intrinsic sympathomimetic effects. Investigation of the structure-activity relationship of these derivatives revealed that the position of the oxypropanolamine side chain and substituents of the 4-OH position play significant roles in imparting their pharmacological effects. Of the derivatives tested, the most effective one was compound 9. In conclusion, the results obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies suggested that these derivatives and compound 9 may be expected to be beta-adreneoceptor blocking agents with nonadrenergic positive chronotropic and inotropic properties.",

We tested the hypothesis that dispersion of ventricular repolarization may be differently affected by interventions destined to provide complete or incomplete protection against malignant arrhythmias in patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS). Twenty-eight patients affected by the Romano Ward form of LQTS entered the study and were divided into three groups: LQTS patients before institution of therapy, patients who did respond to beta-blocker therapy, and patients who continued to have syncope and cardiac arrest despite beta-blockade and who underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation.

Both indexes of dispersion of repolarization were higher in the LQTS patients than in control subjects; also, patients not responding to beta-blockers had a significantly higher dispersion of repolarization than responders. A cutoff value of 100 milliseconds for QTmax-QTmin had an 80% sensitivity and 82% specificity in discriminating between responders and nonresponders. A cutoff value of 6 for QT relative dispersion yielded similar results. The LQTS patients who did not respond to beta-blockade underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation and thereafter remained asymptomatic (mean follow-up, 5 +/- 4 years).

The aim of this communication was to provide more evidence for the existence of separate DHP binding sites on the surface of cultured green monkey renal cells (GMRC). The saturation ligand binding experiments with [3H]-nitrendipine (NTP) and photoaffinity labelling studies with (-)-[3H]-azidopine (AZI) were performed in order to identify and further characterize the DHP receptor on cultured GMRC. Specific high affinity sites identified on GMRC with [3H]-NTP (Bmax = 0.78 +/- 0.03 pmol/mg protein and KD = 0.06 +/- 0.1 nmol/l in native cells) and photolabelled with AZI represent DHP receptor on L-type Ca2+ channels. The low affinity binding sites photolabelled with AZI on GMRC (9.84 +/- 2.4 pmol/mg protein and KD = 3.21 +/- 1.25 nmol/l in native cells) were significantly increased after preincubation of GMRC with low concentrations of DHPs nitrendipine and nisoldipine. Preincubation of GMRC with Ca2+ channel agonist (-)BAYK 8644 significantly reduced specific photolabelling with AZI on GMRC and increased low affinity labelling. Preincubation of (+)BAYK 8644 was without any effect. Niguldipine (DHP with the voluminous substituent on the port side of the DHP ring) partially inhibited specific photolabelling with AZI on GMRC and also partially reduced the maximal number of low affinity binding sites labelled with AZI.

The present study examined EFS-mediated on and off responses in neonatal (3- to 5-d-old), juvenile (2-wk-old), and adult rabbits to determine whether colonic motility undergoes a period of postnatal maturation with respect to the pattern of contraction/relaxation that develops in response to stimulation of the enteric nervous system. Muscle strips from the proximal and distal colon were oriented parallel to the circular muscle layer and stimulated electrically (80 V;0.5-ms pulse width) for 10 s using platinum wire electrodes. Stimulus frequency varied between 1 and 64 Hz. EFS stimulation of circular smooth muscle from the proximal colon of neonatal, juvenile, and adult rabbits was characterized by the development of atropine-sensitive on-contractions. The frequency-response curves were similar for each age group. In the distal colon, EFS of circular smooth muscle from neonatal, juvenile, and adult rabbits produced on-relaxations and atropine-insensitive off-contractions. The frequency-response data for the off-contractions were similar for each age group. Although no age-related differences were observed with respect to the pattern of contractile response to EFS, the force of the proximal colon on contractions and the distal colon off-contractions increased as the animals matured.

The effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was studied on excitatory neurally mediated non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) contractions evoked by electrical field stimulation (EFS) in guinea-pig isolated bronchi. 2. 5-HT (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the excitatory NANC response with 50.9 +/- 5.0% (n = 5, P < 0.01) inhibition at 100 microM. This inhibition was not significantly affected by the 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin (1 microM) when inhibitions (+/- ketanserin) at each concentration of 5-HT were compared by unpaired t tests; however, this concentration appeared to produce a leftward shift (approximately 10 fold) of the 5-HT concentration-inhibition curve. Ketanserin (1 microM) was effective in blocking bronchoconstriction evoked by activation of 5-HT2A receptors on airway smooth muscle. In the presence of ketanserin (1 microM) 5-HT (100 microM) evoked an inhibition of 57.4 +/- 5.9% (n = 5, P < 0.01) with an EC50 of 0.57 microM. 3. Inhibition evoked by 5-HT (0.1-100 microM) was unaffected by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 microM), the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 (0.1 microM), the 5-HT1A/B antagonist, cyanopindolol (1 microM) or the 5-HT3/4 antagonist, ICS 205-930 (1 microM). 4. Methiothepin (0.1 microM) produced an insurmountable inhibition of the effect of 5-HT (0.1-100 microM), reducing the maximum inhibition produced by 5-HT (100 microM) to 30.2 +/- 5.0% (n = 5, P < 0.001) and suggesting a non-competitive antagonism. Methiothepin inhibited the effect of 5-HT (10 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 81 nM. 5. Selective 5-HT receptor agonists were also tested on excitatory NANC responses. 5-Carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, 0.1-100 MicroM) was the most potent, producing a concentration-dependent inhibition with an EC50 of 0.13 MicroM. Calculation of approximate IC25 values (concentration of the agonist required to give a 25% inhibition of the excitatory NANC response) gave a rank order of potency 5-CT > 5-HT> > 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) >alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (alpha-Me-5HT). Sumatriptan, 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT) and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-Me-5HT) were essentially inactive with IC25> 100 MicroM.6. 5-HT (10 microM) did not significantly affect contractile responses to exogenously applied substance P(1 nM-10 Microm).7. The effect of 5-HT was unchanged after incubation with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 Microm). However, pretreatment with charybdotoxin (ChTX,0.1-30 nM), a blocker of the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+channel (K+ca), produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the effect of 5-HT (10 MicroM).8. 5-HT evokes a concentration-dependent inhibition of e-NANC bronchoconstriction in guinea-pig isolated bronchi but does not affect cumulative concentration-dependent contractile responses to substance P, suggesting that inhibition is via a prejunctional receptor. Effects of selective antagonists and agonists suggest that an atypical 5-HT receptor mediates this inhibition. The inhibitory effect of 5-HT does not involve the production of NO, but may involve the opening a ChTX-sensitive K+ca channel.These data suggest that an atypical 5-HT receptor inhibits the release of neuropeptides from sensory C fibres and may act as other inhibitory neuromodulators via the opening of a common K'channel.", 
    "80": "Galanin is localised to sensory nerve fibres and cholinergic nerves in airways. Galantide has been shown to be a novel high affinity antagonist to galanin, since it inhibits galanin-mediated inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion and the neuronal action of galanin in the brain. We investigated the effects of galanin on cholinergic and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) responses to electrical field stimulation in guinea-pig airways, and examined whether galantide antagonised the effect of galanin on neurotransmission. Galanin (10(-6)M) had no effect on cholinergic bronchoconstrictor responses and inhibitory NANC relaxation responses in trachea, but significantly inhibited excitatory NANC bronchoconstrictor responses in bronchi which is due to the release of tachykinins. Galantide (10(-8)-10(-6)M) had no effect on the galanin-induced inhibition of the excitatory NANC responses. Galanin may be important in the modulation of excitatory NANC responses but not cholinergic and inhibitory NANC responses in guinea-pig airways. This modulatory effect may be via a different type of galanin receptor than is present in other organs.",

Standardized exercise tests were recorded at different times for 48 h after infusion with simultaneous bisoprolol assay (high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) in plasma. After a 1-week interval, subjects received oral bisoprolol (10 mg once daily) for 5 days and exercise tests were repeated on day 5 before and 2, 3, and 4 h after dosing, with bisoprolol plasma level determined simultaneously. In the acute period, bisoprolol significantly decreased exercise heart rate (HR: peak effect -20.5 +/- 4%) as compared with placebo. There was a direct relationship (no hysteresis) between beta-blockade and plasma concentrations with a sigmoid (7 subjects) or a linear (3 subjects) best-fit model. After repeated bisoprolol administration, steady-state plasma levels were achieved and 88% of the observed decreases in exercise HR were within the 95% confidence interval (CI) for individual prediction. These data suggest that bisoprolol-induced beta-blockade after repeated oral dosing can be predicted by single-test i.v. dose administration.", 
    "82": "The electrophysiologic effects of a new anti-arrhythmic agent NE-10064 were compared with known class III drugs, E-4031 and sotalol, in sheep Purkinje fibres paced at 1 Hz under normal and simulated ischaemic conditions. NE-10064 0.3-3 microM and sotalol 0.3-300 microM prolonged action potential duration at 90% of repolarization (APD90) and effective refractory period (ERP) concentration dependently without affecting APD50 under normal conditions. E-4031 0.3-300 microM prolonged APD50, APD90, and ERP concentration dependently. Percentage increases in APD90 of 20 +/- 6, 27 +/- 6, and 33 +/- 9 were calculated for NE-10064 3 microM, sotalol 300 microM, and E-4031 1 microM under normal conditions, respectively. The concentration-response curves for all three drugs were shifted to the right under simulated ischaemic conditions. The shift was more marked for NE-10064 and sotalol. Percentage increases in APD90 of 8 +/- 5, 13 +/- 2, and 23 +/- 4 were observed with NE-10064 3 microM, sotalol 300 microM, and E-4031 1 microM during simulated ischaemia. NE-10064 exhibits electrophysiologic characteristics similar to those of known class III agents. Its ability to prolong APD90 under normal conditions may explain its antiarrhythmic action in vivo.", 
    "83": "The chronotropic cardiac effects of falipamil were studied in conscious dogs with chronic atrioventricular (AV) block. Falipamil (0.5-2 mg/kg) initially increased atrial rate dose dependently. After atropine and atropine-pindolol, falipamil (2 mg/kg) decreased atrial rate, but after pindolol, it did not modify atrial rate. After atropine-pindolol-phenoxybenzamine, atropine-pindolol-yohimbine, atropine-pindolol-verapamil, and atropine-pindolol-quinidine pretreatment, falipamil produced atrial bradycardia. Falipamil dose-relatedly decreased ventricular rate. Falipamil (2 mg/kg) decreased ventricular rate after atropine, pindolol, and atropine-pindolol more than under basal conditions. After the other four pretreatments, it also produced ventricular bradycardia. Falipamil did not affect mean blood pressure (MBP) at any dose. These results (a) show that the initial atrial cardio-acceleration produced by falipamil results from its direct vagolytic action; (b) show that absence of atrial bradycardia results from buffering by the vagolytic effect and/or a relatively low basal atrial rate; (c) suggest that the falipamil ventricular bradycardia is partly buffered by the vagolytic effect, norepinephrine (NE) release, and involvement of alpha 2-adrenoceptors; (d) exclude involvement of postsynaptic muscarinic, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, and of the slow calcium current in the mechanism(s) by which falipamil decreases cardiac automaticity; and (e) suggest possible involvement of a quinidine-sensitive current in this (these) mechanism(s).", 
    "84": "For two decades, the evaluation of antiarrhythmic drugs has essentially been based on the count of premature beats during Holter monitoring and the inducibility of tachyarrhythmias during electrophysiologic studies. These approaches are convenient to provide firmly established short-term evaluations of the effects of type I agents in relatively benign arrhythmias occurring in patients with good cardiac function. However, the situation is much more uncertain for long-term outcome in serious tachyarrhythmias occurring in severely diseased patients with an altered myocardium. In addition, indications for type I agents are not really adapted to beta-blockers and type III drugs, the effects of which are much more difficult to assess and depend at least in part on the target arrhythmia. There is an interest in evaluating drug efficacy in terms of responders and nonresponders and in understanding the reasons for a response rather than reliance on pure quantitative data, the meaning of which may be less relevant in the final analysis. We must also recognize the need to reconcile the multiple obstacles encountered when severely diseased patients must be managed efficaciously and safely in the long term with new drugs, the effects of which need objective assessment.", 
    "85": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) adherent to fibrinogen exhibit a delay in the onset of the respiratory burst in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Previously, we demonstrated that H2O2 release in adherent PMNs coincides with the exocytosis of lactoferrin-containing specific granules. Since diradylglycerol (DRG) has been implicated in PMN secretion and oxidant release, we measured DRG formation during PMN adhesion to fibrinogen. PMNs were added to fibrinogen-coated plastic in the presence of fMLP, and H2O2 release, lactoferrin release, and DRG formation measured over a time course of 120 min. H2O2 and lactoferrin release were not apparent until 45-60 min, reaching maximal levels by 120 min. In contrast, DRG concentration increased by 15-30 min, from 275 +/- 27 pmol/mg of protein in resting cells to 600 +/- 173 pmol/mg protein in cells exposed to fMLP. DRG levels returned to base line by 30-45 min (383 +/- 32 pmol/mg of protein) before increasing again between 60 and 120 min (944 +/- 230 pmol/mg of protein and 1632 +/- 351 pmol/mg of protein, respectively). Propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of both H2O2 and lactoferrin release, with maximal inhibition at 50-100 microM. Propranolol also inhibited the second, but not the first phase of DRG formation. Similarly, ethanol treatment completely blocked H2O2 and lactoferrin release, and the second phase of DRG formation. In the presence of ethanol, phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol from 3H-O-alkyl-phosphatidylcholine corresponded to the second, but not the first, phase of DRG formation (23,169 +/- 2,017 cpm/mg protein, ethanol versus 2,696 +/- 261 cpm/mg protein, control). These data indicate that DRG, generated through the activation of PLD, plays an important role in degranulation and oxidant release in adherent PMNs.", 
    "86": "To define metabolic influences on cardiac myosin expression and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase streptozotocin-diabetic rats were treated for 9-10 wk with etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-1) and fatty acid synthesis, or an antilipolytic drug, acipimox. Etomoxir reduced myosin V3 of diabetic rats but did not normalize it. However, the high serum triglyceride, free-fatty acid and cholesterol concentrations in diabetic animals were greatly reduced. After bypassing the CPT-1 inhibition with a medium-chain fatty acid (miglyol) diet, the V3 contents and serum lipids were still reduced in the etomoxir-treated diabetic rats; V3 was also reduced in diabetic rats fed miglyol or treated with acipimox. Since low serum insulin or triiodothyronine concentrations in diabetic rats were not improved by these interventions but changes in V3 were correlated with those in triglyceride, free-fatty acid and cholesterol concentrations, it is likely that myosin may be influenced by some metabolic factors. To assess the role of adrenergic influences, diabetic rats (7-8 wk) were treated with an antisympathotonic drug, moxonidine, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, propranolol, and a bradycardic drug, tedisamil. Myosin V3 was not reduced significantly in moxonidine-treated or propranolol-treated rats in comparison to untreated diabetic rats. Serum thyroid hormones and insulin were not altered, whereas triglycerides were reduced but not significantly by these antiadrenergic agents. Lowering serum lipids in diabetic rats by treatment with etomoxir, miglyol and acipimox increased the depressed SR Ca(2+)-stimulated ATPase activity. On the other hand, in diabetic rats treated with moxonidine, propranolol or tedisamil, the ATPase activity was not increased significantly. These results suggest that normalization of blood lipids is important for improving subcellular organelle function in diabetic hearts with impaired glucose utilization.", 
    "87": "The thermodynamic properties of the binding of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol and of the antagonist propranolol to beta-adrenoceptors of rat lung were investigated. We found that in our experimental conditions, the high- and low-affinity binding sites for the agonist displayed different properties: the binding to the high-affinity binding site was entropy-driven with a small increase in enthalpy, while agonist binding to the low-affinity binding site was enthalpy-driven. Binding of isoproterenol in the presence of GTP or its non-hydrolyzable analogue GppNHp, and the binding of propranolol were enthalpy-driven with a small increase in entropy.",

    "94": "Many experimental observations have demonstrated the modulatory role exerted by several neural structures and neurotransmitters on spontaneous and paroxysmal bioelectric activity of the hippocampus. Recently, the control exerted by locus coeruleus (LC) and its noradrenergic (NA) efferent pathway on different experimental models of epilepsy (e.g. cortical cobalt chronic epilepsy, amygdaloid and hippocampal kindling) was emphasised. On this basis, a series of experiments was performed to elucidate the functional role of LC-NA system on the hippocampal penicillin (PCN) focus and the type of adrenergic receptor involved. The experiments were carried out on 25 rats in which an epileptiform hippocampal focus was obtained through intrahippocampal PCN administration (100-200 I.U.). In these conditions, LC, ipsilateral to PCN hippocampal focus, was stimulated before and after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (2 mg/kg). Results showed a significant reduction of hippocampal spiking frequency during LC stimulation; after i.p. propranolol injection, LC stimulation, at the same parameters, failed to induce any sort of modification of PCN hippocampal spiking frequency. Furthermore, intrahippocampal application of a beta-selective agonist 2-fluoro-noradrenaline (2-FNA) mimics the inhibitory effects of LC stimulation. All data suggest that the LC-NA system is able to induce a net reduction of hippocampal epileptiform focus and the inhibitory NA control involves the activation of adrenergic beta receptors.", 
    "95": "To test the hypothesis that abolition of exercise-induced painless myocardial ischemia by anti-ischemic medication improves prognosis in patients with medically treated coronary artery disease, we studied such patients with painless ischemia during exercise radionuclide ventriculography performed after temporary discontinuation of medication. The test was repeated while patients received conventional medical therapy that rendered angina no worse than New York Heart Association class I. The relative risk of adverse cardiac events was reduced by > 5-fold when painless ischemia was abolished by symptom-dictated therapy. Thus, the abolition of exercise-induced painless ischemia by conventional medical therapy carries a better short-term prognosis in medically treated coronary artery disease, suggesting that therapeutic efficacy may need to be assessed by titration against ischemia and not angina. In patients without overt cardiac events, there were no significant differences between baseline and 12-month measurements of ejection fraction at rest, peak exercise, and the change in ejection fraction from rest to exercise. Thus, in those who remain asymptomatic and event-free, painless ischemia that is easily inducible at baseline despite medication does not lead per se to deterioration of left ventricular systolic function at rest or during exercise over 12 months. Such an effect, if evident as early as at 12 months, would favor a strategy of early revascularization over medical treatment in asymptomatic patients who have inducible painless ischemia despite medication.", 
    "96": "A disulfide bond between two extracellular cysteines, conserved in all G-protein-coupled receptors, is believed to be critical for stabilization of the ligand-binding pocket. The beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2-AR) contains two conserved cysteines (Cys106 and Cys184) as well as two other extracellular cysteines (Cys190 and Cys191). The specificity of the interactions between these four cysteines has not yet been clearly established. Mutants encoding alanines for specific extracellular cysteines in the beta 2-AR gene were constructed and expressed in COS-1 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Ala106, Ala184,190,191, and Ala106,184,190,191 mutants displayed low affinity for the beta-antagonist, 125I-cyanopindolol and insensitivity to dithiothreitol (DTT). The Ala106,191 mutant displayed an intermediate affinity and DTT sensitivity. Mutants Ala184, Ala184,190, and Ala184,191 displayed high affinity and DTT sensitivity, indicating that a solvent-accessible disulfide bond(s) is present in these mutant receptors as in the wild-type beta 2-AR. Additionally, thermal stability studies provided evidence that the extracellular disulfide bonds are essential for stabilization of the high affinity state of the receptor. These studies indicate that the covalent linkage between loops 1 and 2 of the beta 2-AR extracellular domains involves the formation of disulfide bonds, uniquely between Cys106 and Cys191, and Cys184 and Cys190, and is, thus, distinct from that of other G-protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "97": "3T3-F442A adipocytes, which express major beta 3-adrenergic receptors (beta 3-AR) (90%) and minor beta 1-AR (< 10%) and beta 2-AR (< 1%) populations, were used to investigate regulation by n-butyric acid of beta-AR subtype expression. Following butyrate treatment, EC50 values of beta 1- and beta 2-selective agonists, dobutamine and fenoterol, were decreased, whereas that of the beta 3-selective agonist BRL37344 was increased. Direct binding and competition of (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding by selective beta 1- and beta 2-AR antagonists, CGP20712A and ICI118551, and by the beta 3-AR agonist, BRL37344, revealed that both beta 1- and beta 2-AR were increased in butyrate-treated adipocytes, whereas beta 3-AR almost totally disappeared. In control adipocytes, beta 1-, beta 2-, and beta 3-AR transcripts (quantitated by a polymerase chain reaction assay) represented 6.5, 0.5, and 93% of total beta-AR mRNA, respectively. In butyrate-exposed cells, proportions of beta-AR proteins and mRNAs were, respectively, 87 and 94% for beta 1 and 9 and 1% for beta 2-AR. beta 3-ARs were barely detectable in binding assays and accounted for 4.5% of beta-AR transcripts. Variations of beta-AR protein and mRNA levels were accompanied by parallel changes in the transcription rates of the corresponding genes. The differential regulation of the three beta-ARs by n-butyric acid, a dietary factor produced from colonic fermentation, may have significant nutritional and energetic consequences.", 
    "98": "Alanine mutagenesis scanning of the intracellular portion of the human muscarinic cholinergic Hm1 receptor was performed to identify domains mediating agonist induced receptor sequestration. Using these multiple alanine point mutants of Hm1, we had previously identified several receptor domains in the intracellular loops i1-3 that play a role in coupling to phosphatidyl inositol turnover, most notably, a lipophilic residue, Leu-131, in the conserved i2 loop domain DRYXXVXXPL (Moro, O., Lameh, J., Hogger, P., and Sad\u00e9e, W. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 6862-6865). We now demonstrate that alanine substitutions in three of these domains, i.e. middle of the i2 loop and both junctions of the i3 loop, also result in defective sequestration (loss of surface receptor sites accessible to a polar tracer) in transfected human kidney U293 cells. The i2 loop was studied further by single point mutations. The strongest impairment of sequestration occurred with mutant L131A which was also highly defective in phosphatidyl inositol (PI) coupling. Substitution of Leu-131 with several distinct amino acids indicated that a bulky lipophilic residue is required for sequestration in this position, as shown for coupling to PI turnover. Further, the double point mutation, V127A/L131A, almost completely suppressed both sequestration and coupling of Hm1. In the beta 2 adrenoceptor, alanine substitution of the i2 residue Phe-139, equivalent to Leu-131 in Hm1, also resulted in impaired coupling to adenylyl cyclase and sequestration, indicating a general role for this conserved i2 loop residue in both processes. The combined results show that the multi-site domain involved in signal transduction of Hm1 is similar to and overlaps with that involved in sequestration. However, three Hm1 mutants that were moderately deficient in stimulating PI turnover displayed normal sequestration, suggesting distinct mechanisms. We propose that cellular mediators of receptor sequestration are structurally similar or identical to the heterotrimeric G proteins.", 
    "99": "We studied the effects of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, on head twitch behavior induced by 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) administered together with pargyline in mice. Buspirone dose dependently (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.) enhanced head twitch behavior. This effect was blocked by (-)-propranolol and NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]-piperazine hydrobromide). The enhancing effect of buspirone was also observed when mice were pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine. These findings suggest that the enhancing effect of buspirone on head twitch behavior may be exerted through the activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "100": "Both the production of active oxygen species and cellular damage due to concurrent lipid peroxidation are believed to be important factors in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and the ageing process. Since cardiovascular drugs are often administered over a long term, it might be advantageous if they reduced lipid peroxidation. There have been conflicting reports concerning the antiperoxidant effect of nifedipine. Therefore, we investigated whether nifedipine could inhibit lipid peroxidation in a nonenzymatic active oxygen-generating system, utilizing rat crude myocardial membranes, and compared its effect with those of propranolol, nisoldipine, and diltiazem. Nifedipine and diltiazem had no inhibitory effects on the lipid peroxidation of myocardial membranes. In contrast, nisoldipine and propranolol had a concentration-dependent antiperoxidant effect, with IC50 values of 28.2 and 50.1 microM, respectively. In addition, nisoldipine appeared to possess dual antiperoxidant mechanisms, involving both preventive and chain-breaking properties.",

MIA was a more potent inhibitor of both trout apparent erythrocyte proton extrusion (IC50 = 20.1 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcmol l(-1), N = 6) activity (as evaluated by measuring plasma pH changes after addition of catecholamine in vitro) and specific (3)H-MIA binding (IC50 = 257 \u00b1 8.2 nmol l(-1), N = 3) than amiloride, which possessed a proton extrusion IC50 of 26.1 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcmol l(-1) (N = 6) and a binding IC50 of 891 \u00b1 113 nmol l(-1) (N = 3). The specific Na(+) channel blocker phenamil was without effect on adrenergic proton extrusion activity or specific (3)H-MIA binding. Trout erythrocytes suspended in Na(+)-free saline and maintained under normoxic conditions possessed 37,675 \u00b1 6,678 (N = 6) amiloride-displaceable (3)H-MIA binding sites per cell (Bmax, presumptive Na(+)/H(+) antiporters) with an apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 244 \u00b1 29 nmol l(-1) (N = 6). Acute hypoxia (PO2 = 1.2 kPa; 30 min) did not affect the KD, yet resulted in a 65% increase in the number of presumptive Na(+)/H(+) antiporters. Normoxic eel erythrocytes, similarly suspended in Na(+)-free saline, possessed only 17,133 \u00b1 3,716 presumptive Na(+)/H(+) antiporters (N = 6), 45% of that of trout erythrocytes, with a similar KD (246 \u00b1 41 nmol l(-1), N = 6). These findings suggest that inter- and intra-specific differences in the responsiveness of the teleost erythrocyte \u03b2-adrenergic signal transduction system can be explained, in part, by differences in the numbers of Na(+)/H(+) exchange sites.", 
    "102": "A patient with severe tetanus, who had a sympathetic crisis while sedated with 30 mg/h diazepam and 30 mg/h morphine, is described. Satisfactory control of the haemodynamic crisis was achieved with bolus doses of esmolol to a total of 180 mg. A disturbing finding was that although there was adequate control of the tachycardia and hypertension, arterial catecholamine levels remained markedly elevated. Adrenaline levels of 531 pg/ml (normal 10-110 pg/ml) and noradrenaline levels of 1,036 pg/ml (normal 100-500 pg/ml) were recorded when the patient had a systolic arterial pressure of 110 mmHg and a heart rate of 97/min. The implications of this finding are discussed.", 
    "103": "Administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1 mg kg-1 SC) completely antagonised the catalepsy produced by the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor antagonist raclopride (16 mg kg-1 SC). This effect by 8-OH-DPAT was in turn completely antagonised by treatment with the new 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin [(S)-UH-301] (3.5 mg kg-1 SC), but not by the mixed 5-HT1 receptor/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)pindolol (2.0 mg kg-1 SC). The failure by (-)pindolol to antagonise the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on raclopride-induced catalepsy could be due to its beta-receptor-blocking properties, since by themselves both (-)pindolol and the selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol (4 mg kg-1 SC) at least partially antagonised the raclopride-induced catalepsy. The present results provide further support for specific interactions between 5-HT1A and DA D2 receptor mechanisms in the mediation of extrapyramidal motor functions in the rat.", 
    "104": "Experiments were done on anesthetized and curarized cats to see whether the increase in blood pressure caused by electrical stimulation of group I afferent fibers is related to a direct reflex effect on the heart. The reflex effect of electrical stimulation of group I afferent fibers from the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles on the arterial pressure, the left ventricular pressure, the inotropic state of the left ventricle (dP50/dt) and the heart rate were compared before and after beta-blockade with propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenously) to reduce a possible direct effect on the heart. The same comparison was made before and after alpha-blockade with phentolamine (2.5 mg/kg intravenously) to keep the peripheral resistance constant. Electrical stimulation of group I afferent fibers caused an increase in the blood pressure, the left ventricular pressure and, to some extent, the inotropic state of the left ventricle and the heart rate. The beta-blockade had no significant effect on these increases, while the alpha-blockade abolished the increase in blood pressure. It is concluded that the effect of stimulation of group I afferent fibers on the blood pressure is not dependent on a direct reflex effect on the heart, but can be better explained by a reflex increase in the peripheral resistance."
