    "0": "Fifty patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma were studied in a double-blind study with Timolol ophthalmic solution, in a concentration of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.5%, and Pilocarpine eye drops 1%, 2% and 4% over a period of seventeen weeks. Timolol was instilled twice daily into the conjunctival sack, or Pilocarpine four times daily. The results of the investigations may be summarised as follows: Timolol (0.1%-0.5%) achieved a mode-rate reduction in I.O.P. of 29%, compared to a 10.3% drop with Pilocarpine (1%-4%). Under treatment with Timolol, there was a statistically significant reduction in pulse rate of 12%, also a slight drop in blood-pressure of 3.5% systolic and 2.5% diastolic. During this study, those treated with Timolol showed no statistical changes of visual acuity, visual field, or on slit lamp examination and ophthalmoscopy of the optic disk and retina. The average pupillary diameter and tear flow (Schirmer Test), were little changed in the group of patients treated with Timolol, whereas in the Pilocarpine group, the size of the pupil decreased by 30.5% as expected.", 
    "1": "Insulin (5 to 40 I.U.) produced dose-dependent positive inotropic effect in the isolated rat heart. The responses to insulin were markedly inhibited in the presence of propranolol (1 . 1X10(-6) M). Insulin responses were markedly reduced in reserpine pretreated (5 mg/kg, i.p.) rats. Theophylline (4.4 mM), the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, potentiated the responses to insulin, whereas imidazole (20 mM), the phosphodiesterase stimulator inhibited the responses to insulin. The data suggest that the positive inotropic effects of insulin in rat heart is mediated through the release of cardiac catecholamines which stimulates beta-adrenoceptors. The final mediator of cardiac action seems to be cyclic-AMP.", 
    "2": "The effects of tetraethylammonium (TEA), a specific blocker of K+ conductance, on calcium fluxes and insulin release in isolated islets were investigated in order to explore the possible relevance of changes in K+ conductance to the mechanism by which glucose both decreases Ca fractional outflow rate from and stimulates Ca entry into the beta-cell. TEA reduced 86Rb efflux from prelabeled islets to the same extent as a non-insulinotropic glucose concentration. In the absence of glucose, TEA failed to affect 45Ca fractional outflow rate, 45Ca net uptake and insulin release from isolate islets. The drug lowered the threshold concentration of glucose required to stimulate these parameters and dramatically increased the cationic and secretory responses to intermediate glucose concentrations. The effect of TEA was less marked at a high glucose concentration. In the absence or presence of TEA, the effect of glucose to stimulate 45Ca efflux required the presence of extracellular calcium. It is concluded that TEA by inhibiting K+ conductance mimics to a limited extent the effect of glucose in causing the gating of voltage-sensitive calcium channels in isolated islets. The inhibitory effect of glucose upon Ca outflow rate, however, appears unrelated to changes in K+ conductance.", 
    "3": "The pattern of cardiac arrhythmias and their treatment, by propranolol and chlordiazepoxide, during the first 48 hr of alcohol withdrawal has been studied. Prior to treatment, the incidence of serious and life-threatening arrhythmias was found to be very low and uncorrelated with most biochemical parameters. Propranolol treatment, while efficacious in controlling arrhythmias, was limited due to its association with hallucinations. Chlordiazepoxide was associated with poor early control of arrhythmias. The combination of propranolol and chlordiazepoxide was found to perform best overall with substantial reductions in arrhythmias and the fewest treatment failures.", 
    "4": "1. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in the release of renin during head-up tilt has been studied in five normal subjects and in four tetraplegic patients with cervical spinal-cord transection above the sympathetic outflow. Blood pressure, heart rate and concentrations of plasma noradrenaline, plasma adrenaline and plasma renin activity were measured during head-up tilt to 45 degrees before and after acute beta-adrenoreceptor blockade with intravenous propranolol. 2. In the normal subjects there were minimal changes in blood pressure during head-up tilt and there was a rise in both plasma noradrenaline concentration and plasma renin activity. After propranolol values of plasma renin activity at rest fell with little change occurring during head-up tilt. 3. In the tetraplegic patients there was a substantial fall in blood pressure during head-up tilt. Concentrations of plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline did not change but there was a marked increase in plasma renin activity. Values of plasma renin activity both at rest and during head-up tilt were unaffected by propranolol. 4. We conclude that in tetraplegic patients renin release during head-up tilt may occur independently of sympathetic nervous activity and is probably largely dependent on activation of renal vascular receptors.", 
    "5": "A double-blind cross-over trial of timolol maleate (Timoptol) while routine medical therapy was continued gave the result that pressure was reduced by 3.22 mmHg is compared to placebo and 5.01 compared to pre-timolol levels in 24 patients. There was also a small (1.858 mmHg) drop in pressure in placebo treated eyes, a small and statistically significant drop in resting pulse rate, 76.67 to 71.39/min, and a small but not statistically significant drop in diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "6": "The metabolic and hormonal responses to oral glucose were studied in a patient with a pheochromocytoma before treatment, after alpha-blockade, after combined alpha- and beta-blockade, and after surgical removal of the tumor. Before treatment, fasting blood glucose was elevated [6.5 mmol/liter (117 mg/dl); normal range, 4.2--5.5 mmol/liter (75--100 mg/dl)], as was the fasting plasma nonesterified fatty acid level (1.19 mmol/liter; normal range, 0.06--0.7 mmol/liter), the blood total ketone body concentration (0.50 mmol/liter; normal range, 0.02--0.44 mmol/liter) and the lactate ot pyruvate ratio (16.2; normal range, 5.9--15.01. These abnormalities were corrected by alpha-adrenergic blockade alone and together with beta-blockade. Oral glucose tolerance (50 g) was mildly impaired in the untreated state, and the insulin response was decreased. Both alpha- and alpha- plus beta-blockade restored the insulin response to glucose but failed to correct the glucose intolerance. Three months after removal of the tumor, all metabolic findings were normal. The correction of the fasting metabolite concentrations and serum insulin levels by alpha-adrenergic blockade suggests that an alpha-adenergic effect causes the original metabolic abnormalities. The residual glucose intolerance after adrenergic blockade may result from incomplete blockade or factors other than alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity.", 
    "7": "Serum human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP) responses to adrenergic modulation were measured in 24 normal subjects. Epinephrine (6 microgram/min) was infused to stimulate adrenergic alpha- and beta-receptors. Beta-receptor stimulation was achieved by infusing epinephrine and selectively blocking alpha- receptors with phentolamine, and alpha-receptor stimulation was achieved by infusing epinephrine and blocking beta-receptors with propranolol. Combined alpha- and beta-receptor stimulation caused a small but insignificant rise in hPP concentration. Phentolamine alone caused a twofold rise in hPP concentration, which was abolished by simultaneous atropine infusion. Propranolol alone had no effect. Adrenergic beta-receptor stimulation with epinephrine plus phentolamine caused a sevenfold rise from 45 +/- 10 to 351 +/- 60 pM (P < 0.05), whereas adrenergic alpha-receptor stimulation caused a significant fall from 100 +/- 25 pM (the rise in hPP concentration induced by epinephrine) to 44 +/- 7.8 pM. The changes in hPP concentration did not correlate with changes in serum insulin, glucose, or free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. The pattern of the response was quite different from insulin, while reached a peak within 1 min of phentolamine administration, whereas hPP levels rose slowly to a peak at 45 min. The rise induced by adrenergic beta-receptor stimulation with epinephrine plus phentolamine was equivalent to the rise from 40 +/- 11 to 280 +/- 48 pM caused by an insulin-induced fall in serum glucose of about 50% and that induced by isoproterenol infusion, which caused a fourfold rise from 69 +/- 3 to 271 +/- 84 pM. These data suggest that the adrenergic system may be important in the regulation of hPP release.", 
    "8": "The normal period of depression of sinoatrial node automaticity (sinus node recovery time, SNRT) following one minute of overdrive right atrial pacing was evaluated in 34 subjects, aged 27--83 years. Specific attention was paid to the influence of the patient's heart rate, atrial pacing rate (100 and 130 bpm) and site, and of vagal and sympathetic effects, as assessed by observations following the administration of atropine, 0 . 03 mg/kg, and propranolol, 0 . 15 mg/kg. Normal SNRT was 1046 +/- 17 ms at 100 bpm and 980 +/- 19 ms at 130 bpm. Linear regression analysis showed that at pacing rates of both 100 and 130 bpm, both before and after autonomic block, a highly significant relation existed between SNRT and the stable P-P interval observed after cessation of pacing. These regression equations were used to develop a correction factor for cycle length in assessing SNRT (corrected SNRT = SNRT--0 . 86 X cycle length, where 0 . 86 was the slope of the regression equation). The mean corrected SNRT was 314 +/- 10 ms and 290 +/- 8 ms at 100 and 130 bpm, respectively. Vagal influences increased SNRT and were of greater magnitude than the decrease in SNRT due to sympathetic effects. Corrected SNRT was significantly longer following left atrial than following right atrial pacing, but in those eight patients studied, was not significantly different following right atrial or right ventricular stimulation.", 
    "9": "Infusion of noradrenaline at rates between 32-160 nmol.min-1 for 30 min into one lateral cerebral ventricle of conscious sheep caused a diuresis which was accompanied by negative solute-free water reabsorption and which lasted for 90-120 min. The range of noradrenaline infusion rates used reflects differences between individual animals in the rate of infusion necessry to cause diuresis. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of noradrenaline at half the diuretic rate caused no significant changes in urine flow. The diuresis induced by ICV noradrenaline infusion was prevented by concurrent ICV administration of the alpha-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, but was not prevented by concurrent ICV administration of the beta antagonist, propranolol, or by concurrent intravenous infusion of phentolamine. Intravenous infusion of noradrenaline at rates that were diuretic by ICV infusion caused a diuresis of approximately 30 min duration which coincided with the period of intravenous noradrenaline infusion. This diuresis was prevented by concurrent intravenous infusion of phentolamine. These results were interpreted as indicating that the higher rates of ICV infusion of noradrenaline caused the prolonged water diuresis by acting at a site in the brain and, thereby, inhibiting the release of endogenous vasopressin. ICV infusion of noradrenaline at all rates was followed by a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure and pulse pressure with variable changes in heart rate and by depression of the rates of renal clearance of PAH, potassium and total solute.", 
    "10": "A case of hyperemesis gravidarum at 9 weeks' gestation is described for which no cause could initially be found. Intravenous feeding was needed as a life preserving measure and following improvement on this regime the patient went into a thyrotoxic crisis which was successfully diagnosed and treated. The continuing pregnancy and its outcome is described. The need for practitioners to remember vomiting as a presenting sign of thyrotoxicosis is stressed.", 
    "11": "The clinical usage of antiarrhythmic drugs may pose problems which could be solved by the direct application of the basic principles of pharmacokinetics. These problems involve the calculation of intravenous infusion rates and or oral dosages. Examples are provided by the rate of initial infusion of lignocaine in order to obtain a concentration within the therapeutic range, the eventual adjustment of this rate of infusion and the calculation of a loading dose. As regards the oral route, the calculation of the doses of procainamide is taken as an example. The estimation of the serum procainamide is a method for determining whether the dose should be increased or whether the drug is ineffective when no clinical result is observed. The pharmacokinetics of the main antiarrhythmic drugs are reviewed; procainamide, quinidine, propanolol, phenytoin, disopyramide. The therapeutic dose, clearance, extraction coefficient, bioavailability and half-life are the object of particular study. The fractioning of the dose and the total dose in a 24 hour period depend on these factors. The effects of cardiac, renal and hepatic failure on the clearance of each drug are recalled. These pharmacokinetic principles help the clinician not only in the prescription of an antiarrhythmic drug but also in deciding on the indications for drug serum concentration, estimations which are particularly useful in some difficult clinical situations, and in interpreting the results.", 
    "12": "Nine patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT) that could be repeatedly terminated by a Valsalva maneuver are described. In two, the tachycardia would cease for only a few seconds and then resume, whereas in seven, the tachycardia could be permanently and reproducibly terminated with a Valsalva maneuver. In all patients the tachycardia ended during the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver, when blood pressure and radiographic measurement indicated that cardiac dimensions had been reduced dramatically. The speed with which the Valsalva maneuver terminated VT incresed in direct proportion to the strain pressure. Maneuvers such as standing or nitroglycerin, which independently reduce cardiac dimensions, enhanced the potency of the Valsalva maneuvers. Pretreatment with atropine or propranolol in four patients did not alter the response of VT to the Valsalva maneuver. Thus, it appears that a strong Valsalva maneuver can terminate some forms of VT, most likely related to an abrupt reduction in cardiac dimensions.", 
    "13": "The plasma adenosine 3', 5' - cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to 50 micrograms of intravenous glucagon was examined in 14 normal euthyroid subjects, 15 patients with thyrotoxicosis and 5 patients with myxedema. The cyclic AMP responses to 50 micrograms of intravenous glucagon was significantly higher in the hyperthyroid group than in the euthyroid or hypothyroid group. However, the areas of overlap between all three groups were large and there was little relationship between the plasma cyclic AMP response to glucagon and the biochemical assessment of thyroid function. Serial studies of the response to 50 micrograms glucagon were carried out in four patients receiving treatment for thyrotoxicosis. Again, there was not consistent relationship between the plasma cyclic AMP responsiveness to glucagon and the free thyroxine index. It is concluded that although the plasma cyclic AMP response to glucagon is increased in thyrotoxicosis and decreased in myxedema, the variability of this response in thyroid disease precludes its use as a tissue index of thyroid hormone responsiveness.", 
    "14": "To assess the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the control of aldosterone reease in response to heat exposure, 6 sodium restricted subjects were studied on three random experimental days: a control day and two heat exposure days (46C, 35 mbar, 90 min) with and without propranolol. Plasma aldosterone, renin activity, ACTH and K+ were determined from plasma samples taken every 20 min from 08:00 to 14:00. After propranolol administration, plasma aldosterone responsiveness to heat exposure increased, though plasma renin activity was depressed. Concurrently, propranolol reduced heat tolerance, leading to an increased ACTH and cortisol release in 3 of the subjects. Plasma levels of K+ were not significantly different during both heat exposure days. The enhanced response of plasma aldosterone may in part be related to the concurrent rises in ACTH, but a similar sustained aldosterone response was observed in subjects without ACTH release. Except for a significantly lower heart rate, propranolol induced no changes in hemodynamic and thermal response to heat. Plasma volume, blood pressure, sodium excretion, mean skin and rectal temperature rises and body weight losses were not modified by prior administration of the drug. The dissociation between aldosterone and renin activity after propranolol administration suggests that the aldosterone response to heat exposure is not primarily mediated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system. Propranolol may lead to a reduced metabolic clearance rate of aldosterone or increase the sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to concomitant changes in the known stimuli, but the involvement of an additional factor in aldosterone regulation during heat exposure cannot be excluded.", 
    "15": "Electrical stimulation of rat uterine preparations induced constant and reproducible contractions. The inhibitory effect of some adrenergic substances was tested on oestrogen- or progesterone-primed electrically stimulated rat uteri. The rank order of the relative potencies of some adrenergic agonists was shifted from Iso greater than E greater than Salb greater than Ne greater than H 133/22 greater than Phe greater than Clo in the oestrogen primed uterus to Iso greater than Salb greater than E greater than Ne greater than Phe greater than Clo greater than H 133/22 in progesterone primed uterus. The selective beta 2- agonist salbutamol was relatively more potent in progesterone treated rats than in oestrogen treated, while the beta 1-agonist H 133/22 was more potent in oestrogen dominated uterus. We therefore suggested that beta 2-receptors is dominating in the progesterone primed uterus, while both beta 1 and beta 2-receptors could be found in oestrogen primed uterus. No dissociation between the inhibitory effect on contractility and the cAMP increasing effect of isoprenaline could be demonstrated in rat uteri.", 
    "16": "The results presented in this study indicate that the defect in catecholamine-stimulated adenylate-cyclase which is characteristic of the ob/ob mouse is associated with a decrease in the sensitivity of the system to guanine nucleotides (guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate and guanosine 5'-triphosphate). No difference in the beta-adrenergic receptor activity was found between the lean and obese mice on the basis of their capacity to bind the beta-adrenergic antagonist [3H]dihydroalprenolol. The data suggest that a defect in the activation of the adenylate cyclase by beta-adrenergic agents may reside in the guanyl nucleotide binding site(s).", 
    "17": "Rhythmic motility of teats in lactating cows in vivo was studied by an improved plethysmographic technique. Oxytocin was infused intravenously and drugs were injected into the artery of the filled udder. The beta-adrenergic agent, isoprenaline, induced relaxation of the teats whereas the alpha-adrenergic agents phenylephrine and noradrenaline, elicited contraction. In one animal however, noradrenaline always exerted a biphasic effect. Pre-treatment with propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, changed the biphasic effect into a purely activating response. Adrenaline, which exhibits both alpha and beta effects, induced relaxation, but after propranolol treatment relaxation was abolished and even converted into contraction of the teat. It seems clear that both alpha and beta adrenoceptors are present in longitudinal smooth muscles of the teats. Milk losses as intermittent spurts were observed in several cows. Spurts occurred synchronously with rhythmical teat motility in the filled udder during oxytocin infusion. The intensity of milk leakage was increased by isoprenaline and inhibited by noradrenaline, indicating the presence of alpha and beta receptors in teat sphincter muscles. Starting and stopping of milk spurts in correlation with rhythmical teat contractions were studied by audiovisual synchronization of video recording tape. The most common type of spurt began near the middle of the teat's relaxation phase and ended either just before or exactly at the beginning of the contraction phase. Interruption of the spurt is primarily due to closure of the streak canal.", 
    "18": "Experiments were carried out in dogs with the use of resistography of circulatory-isolated internal carotid artery. Both activation of adenyl cyclase by adenosine and inhibition of phosphodiesterase by theophylline in the vascular wall result in a significant decrease in the vasoconstrictor effect of prestaglandin E2. On the contrary, inhibition of adenyl cyclase by the beta-blocker propranolol or activation of phosphodiesterase by imidazol in the vascular wall causes potentiation of vasoconstriction brought about by prostaglandin E2. Thus the endogenous cyclic AMP either antagonizes the vasoconstrictor effect of prostaglandin E2, or the latter affects vascular smooth muscles by influencing the activity of enzymes that are responsible for the cyclic AMP level in the vascular wall.", 
    "19": "Abdominal aortic constriction in rats results in mild cardiac hypertrophy (20% increase in left ventricular weight compared to sham-operated controls) which is associated with increased numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors (123 +/- 7.3 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- SE) vs. 87 +/- 4.3 fmol/mg in controls, P < 0.01) without changes in their affinities for dihydroalprenolol. In vitro synthesis of phosphatidylcholine through successive methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine by S-adenosyl-L-methionine is enhanced in the hypertrophied myocardium) 0.38 +/- 0.03 nmol/mg per 30 minutes vs. 0.23 +/- 0.03 nmol/mg per 30 minutes in controls, P < 0.01). In both experimental groups, methyltransferase activity has a high affinity for S-adenosyl-L-methionine (Km = 6.8 microM), depends on Mg2+, is optimal around pH 9.0, and is inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (ki = 8.3 microM). The possible relationship between phospholipid methylation and changes in myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors was studied in both normal and hypertrophied hearts. Preincubation of cardiac membranes with S-adenosyl-L-methionine increased the numbers of b eta-adrenergic receptors in proportion to the duration of incubation and the concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. In both groups, S-adenosyl-homocysteine, but not 5'-AMP or L-methionine, attenuated the increase in beta-adrenoreceptors. These results indicate that phospholipid methylation may be an important mechanism for regulation of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in both normal and hypertrophied myocardium.", 
    "20": "The effect of isoproterenol, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin on the accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) was studied in homogeneous neuronal cultures from 8-day chick embryo hemispheres. Among the catecholamines, isoproterenol had a more pronounced effect on the accumulation of cAMP. Norepinephrine and dopamine were considerably less potent and serotonin was ineffective. The response of neuronal cells to isoproterenol was inhibited by propranolol, suggesting that the cAMP increase was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Maximally effective concentration of isoproterenol (10 microM) produced a 2.5-fold increase in cAMP content which is in contrast to the much greater cAMP response elicited by isoproterenol in chick brain tissue. These results suggest that in chick embryo hemispheres the nonneuronal cells are the major sites of the effect of beta-adrenergic agonists. The low responsiveness of the cAMP-generating system found in neuronal cultures is interpreted as reflecting either the number of beta-adrenergic receptors or the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase at the membrane level.", 
    "21": "The beta-blocking agent bufuralol is subject to first-pass metabolism and is eliminated from the body almost entirely by biotransformation. Its major metabolite in plasma (1'-hydroxy-bufuralol) is biologically active and may contribute to the pharmacological effect of the drug. The effect of renal failure on the behavior of the parent compound and three of its metabolites was studied by comparing their kinetics in normal volunteers and in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Bufuralol was given orally to all subjects (20 mg); some of the healthy volunteers also received the drug intravenously (5 mg). Renal failure was found to be associated with a marked increase of the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves of the parent compound, whereas its halflife of elimination was not markedly influenced. The behavior of 1'-hydroxy-bufuralol was consistent with a decreased renal clearance. The behavior of bufuralol in patients with renal failure was analyzed using the clearance approach. From this analysis it appears that the presystemic biotransformation of bufuralol is decreased in renal failure and that changes in systemic clearance are compensated in our patients by modifications of the volume of distribution, resulting in little net change in the halflife of elimination.", 
    "22": "Beta antagonists competitively block beta 1-adrenoceptors that mediate both the rate and force of myocardial contraction. Their precise mechanism of anti-anginal action is uncertain. A reduction in oxygen demand may relative pain and improve effort tolerance. Alternatively inhibition of the adrenergic drive to contraction may offset the increased ventricular wall tension due to incomplete relaxation. Partial agonist activity in a beta-antagonist does not influence efficacy nor protect against airflow obstruction. Membrane stabilising activity is clinically trivial. Cardioselectivity makes airflow obstruction less likely at low but not at high blood concentrations of drug. Alpha-receptor antagonism may also prevent broncho-constriction; it has not been assessed in coronary vasospasm. The dosage and choice of drugs are based on pharmaco-kinetic and dynamic data in animals and man. The major side-effects of beta-blockade are heart failure and airflow obstruction. Cardiotoxicity from overdosage may be treated with isoprenaline, dopamine or glucagon while beta 2-agonists will reverse bronchoconstriction. Since beta-antagonists raise-peripheral vascular impedance, reduction of preload with nitrates enhances their antianginal efficacy. Combining a beta-antagonist with nifedipine seems especially useful. Beta-blockade is worth trying in angina with normal coronary arteries. In acute coronary insufficiency beta-blockade reduces both the work-load on the heart and the somatic features of anxiety, so preparing patients for investigations, like coronary arteriography, aimed at definitive treatment.", 
    "23": "This paper evaluates the haemodynamics of intravenous Acebutolol (SECTRAL) (0.5 mgm/Kgm) in the acute phase of myocardial infarction uncomplicated by hypertension, cardiac failure or conduction abnormalities. Nineteen observations were made on 15 consecutive patients. Haemodynamic parameters were recorded just before, and at 15 and 30 min after injections, using Swan-Ganz Catheter-Thermister and Edslab Cardiac Output Computer (9520) in the Intensive Care Unit. All patients survived; none had extension of infarction. The Heart Rate dropped by 9 +/- 1% (+/- SEM) (from 90.2 +/- 4.0 to 81.6 +/- 3.1 per min, P less than 0.001) but systolic and mean Blood Pressures were not significantly altered. Pulmonary Capillary Pressure was elevated by 2.5 +/- 6% (from 11.6 +/- 0.8 to 14.4 +/- 0.9 mmHg P less than 0.001) but cardiac failure hardly ever developed clinically. The mean Pulmonary Arterial Pressure rose by 10 +/- 2% (P less than 0.005) while the Right Atrial mean increased from 6.0 +/- 1.0 to 8.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.005). Although the Cardiac Index was depressed by 11 +/- 2% (from 3.0 +/- 0.1 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 L/min/M2; P less than 0.001), the Stroke Index remained virtually unaffected. Myocardial oxygen consumption per min as reflected by Heart Rate x BP product declined by 12 +/- 2% (P less than 0.001), while the Stroke Work Index was lowered by 9 +/- 3% (P less than 0.005). The haemodynamic profile indicates that intravenous Acebutolol in uncomplicated infarcts is well tolerated, and that it could be employed with advantage to manipulate determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption through reduction of Heart Rate Pressure product and Stroke Work Index.", 
    "24": "Cardioselective property of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking action of atenolol and its effect on the AV conduction, the atrial muscle refractory period and the cardiac contractility were studied in comparison with these of propranolol. A ratio of pA2 values obtained in the isolated right-atrial preparations and the isolated tracheal preparations of guinea pigs demonstrated that atenolol was highly cardioselective, while propranolol was non-selective. This cardioselective property of atenolol was confirmed in in vivo experiments using guinea pigs. Atenolol increased the AV conduction time and decreased the cardiac contractility dose-dependently in anesthetized dogs of which the heart was electrically driven at fixed rates. At 140 beats/min, AV block was observed at 10 mg/kg, i.v. in 3 of 8 dogs, and further increase in a dose ti 30 mg/kg resulted in acute heart failure in one of remaining 5 dogs, while propranolol, though showing a tendency to be less potent in depressing AV conduction in a dose range less than 0.3 mg/kg, produced a state of heart failure in 2 of 5 dogs at 3 mg/kg, i.v. and AV block in all of the remainder at 10 mg/kg, i.v. Functional refractory period of AV node as well as functional and effective refractory period the the atrial muscle were increased dose-dependently by atenolol and propranolol. There were no significant differences between both drugs regarding these effects. Further increase in a pacing rate to 160 and 180 beats/min augmented the depressing effect of both drugs on the AV conduction.", 
    "25": "The evaluation of special literature shows that in recent years a considerable change took place in the recommendations concerning the medicamentous therapy of high blood pressure. According to this the beta-receptor blockers took the first place, whereas the Rauwolfia-preparations increasingly receded into the background. An analysis of the consumption of antihypertensive drugs in the County of Leipzig resulted in the fact that the newer scientific knowledge is only very slowly followed in practice; thus the Rauwolfia-preparations are still at the top in the prescription of antihypertensive drugs. The results show that increased troubles are necessary to transfer scientific knowledge more quickly into practice. The ways to this are shown.", 
    "26": "The endocrine system becomes involved in the physiopathologic mechanisms of essential arterial hypertension (EAH) by the interference of hormones with the pressor and depressor substances. A \"depressor\" pharmacodynamic model with beta-blockers based on the variations of hormone-dependent data offers a series of characteristics for assessing the vasoconstrictive and volemic components, evolution (accelerated for instance) and treatment. Hormone data are also useful for avoiding errors and for increasing the efficiency and control of the therapy. It is not uncommon for EAH to become endocrine-dependent, for instance: increase in aldosterone secretion by activation of the renin-angiotensin (RA) system or of the hypophysis- corticoadrenal system and the adreno-sympathetic system, transforms the relatively \"benign\" evolution of EAH into an \"accelerated\" one. The incidence of hyperreactive corticoadrenal (with or without altered steroidogenesis), corticoadrenal hyperplasia or adenoma, is in reality higher than commonly diagnosed.", 
    "27": "The actions of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol, pindolol, timolol, carteolol, sotalol and practolol, were examined regarding effects on crayfish giant axon in an attempt to determine the relationship among chemical structure and local anesthetic activity, and the interaction of these drugs with Ca++. The activities of local anesthetics such as procaine and lidocaine served for comparisons. A conventional microelectrode technique was used to obtain the resting membrane and action potentials. All drugs except sotalol and practolol dose-dependently inhibited the dV/dt and amplitude of the action potential with a slight decrease (less than 6 mV) in the resting membrane potential. The relative potencies of these drugs in the reduction of the dV/dt were as follows: propranolol 13.3, pindolol 1.7, procaine 1.0, lidocaine 0.91, timolol 0.71 and carteolol 0.22. Sotalol and practolol had little activity. The chemical structure of the drugs for local anesthetic action was closely related to that of the lipophilic aromatic group; the most potent activity seen in the naphthyl group. Potentiation of the local anesthetic activity in low Ca++ solution was obtained with pindolol, timolol, carteolol, sotalol and practolol. Reduction of the activity in high Ca++ solution was observed with propranolol, pindolol, timolol, procaine and lidocaine. These results suggest that external Ca++ competes with the local anesthetic action of the beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, at the site of the action potential generating mechanism.", 
    "28": "EG-626, 7-ethoxycarbonyl-6, 8-dimethyl-4-hydroxymethyl-1 (2H)-phthalazinone, was found to be a considerably potent cardiotonic agent. It produced both the positive chronotropic and inotropic actions in the guinea pig heart muscle. Positive inotropic action of isoproterenol was potentiated by EG-626 at the concentration which did not produce a substantial positive inotropic action by itself. Cardiac action potential was not modified by EG-626 at concentrations sufficient to produce positive inotropic actions. EG-626 has a strong activity to produce slow responses in the depolarized myocardium, indicating that it can increase the density of the slow channels. The possibility was shown that the increase in the density of the slow channel may play an important role in the positive inotropic action of EG-626. The increase in the intracellular cyclic AMP due to the phosphodiesterase inhibition is tentatively most likely to be the cause of the EG-626 induced in the density of the slow channels.", 
    "29": "A pharmacokinetic investigation was carried out on a group of 13 elderly patients (2 males, 11 females, mean age 79 years) who were either mildly hypertensive or had a history of hypertension. The aim of the study was to determine and compare the plasma concentrations, urinary excretion and pharmacokinetic parameters of pindolol (Visken) after a single oral dose and in steady-state. Each patient received 10 mg (two 5 mg tablets in one dose) of pindolol daily for 7 days. Blood plasma and urine samples were obtained for up to 24 h after administration on days 1 and 7, blood pressure and pulse rate were also taken on the same days. The pharmacokinetic parameters and the effects on blood pressure and pulse rate of pindolol after 7 days of treatment showed no statistical difference to those recorded after a single dose. Kinetic data in this group did not differ from findings recorded in previous studies conducted on younger subjects. Results of this study indicate that pindolol does not accumulate on repeated administration to older patients. Therefore no adjustment of the usual dosage is necessary when prescribing for this age group. Finally the problems concerning pharmacokinetic investigations in elderly patients are discussed.", 
    "30": "The effect of epinephrine, phenoxybenzamine (alpha-receptor blocker), and propranolol (beta-receptor blocker) on the oviductal motility in an in vitro system was investigated in strips from infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, and uterus from laying hens. Epinephrine resulted in a significant (P less than .05) contraction of both infundibulum (+166.6%) and magnum (+70.3%) and relaxation of the uterus (-56.9%), while the response of the isthmus was inconsistent. Epinephrine induced contractions in propranolol blocked strips in all four oviductal segments studied (infundibulum, +138.1; magnum, +70.4; isthmus, +35.9; and uterus, +30.1%). Epinephrine, in phenoxybenzamine-blocked strips, resulted in relaxation of all segments (infundibulum, -27.5; magnum, -40.5; isthmus, -63.4; and uterus -53.6%). These results suggest that the activity of alpha-excitatory adrenergic receptors is greater in the anterior than in the posterior segment of the oviduct. conversely, greater activity of beta-inhibitory receptors seems to be present in the posterior than in the anterior segment of the oviduct.", 
    "31": "The effects of cardioselective beta-1 adrenergic agonist, 1-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)-isopropylamino-2-propanol), i.e., prenalterol, were examined on direct and continuous measurements of left ventricular (LV) pressure, diameter, dP/dt, velocity of shortening, arterial pressure, iliac blood flow and heart rate in 10 conscious dogs. Prenalterol was infused on 3 separate days in doses of 1, 2 and 4 micrograms/kg/min for 15 min. The largest dose of the drug increased LV/dP/dt by 70 +/- 7% from 3581 +/- 130, velocity of LV shortening by 27 +/- 4% from 86 +/- 7 mm/sec, heart rate by 51 +/- 9% from 80 +/- 5 beats/min and iliac blood flow by 40 +/- 4% from 134 +/- 15 ml/min and decreased LV end-diastolic diameter by 8 +/- 2% from 35 +/- 2 mm and LV end-systolic diameter by 15 +/- 2% from 24 +/- 2 mm. All these responses were significant, P < .01. Mean arterial pressure did not change. The positive inotropic effects persisted for 1 hr. The lowest dose of the drug studied increased LV dP/dt and velocity but not heart rate. Practolol, a beta-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, prevented the positive inotropic effects and the increases in iliac blood flow indicating that prenalterol exerts its cardiovascular actions primarily by stimulation of beta-1 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "32": "1. Metoprolol (ME), pindolol (PI) and propranolol (PR) were studied in nine subjects at different doses and at 'maximum beta-adrenoceptor blockade' at a defined exercise load. Exercise tests were performed after each dosing period; isoprenaline stimulation was studied at the highest dose level. 2. ME and PR reduced heart rate at rest with most doses tested, while PI had no effect on resting heart rate. 3. Exercise heart rate was reduced with the smallest daily doses (ME 75 mg; PI 7.5 mg; PR 60 mg), and maximum reduction was from 163 to 116 beats/min (ME), 124 (PT) and 115 (PR) beats/min with daily doses of 242, 23 and 233 mg, respectively. 4. Resting blood pressure was not significantly affected by any beta-adrenoceptor blocker dose, but exercise induced blood pressure decreased from 166 to 130 (ME), 138 (PI) and 131 (PR) mm Hg, respectively. 5. Mean plasma concentrations at 'maximum beta-adrenoceptor blockade' were 158 (ME), 24 (PI) and 159 (PR) ng/ml without significant differences in the plasma level variation between beta-adrenoceptor blockers. 6. Isoprenaline doses required to increase heart rate by 30 beats/min were 3.8 microgram (control), 22 microgram (ME), 458 microgram (PI) and 200 microgram (PR), respectively. The differences may be due to different ratios of beta 1, beta 2 activity of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers tested.", 
    "33": "Combination of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent visken with glucagon in the acute period of myocardial infarction possesses higher antiarrhythmic activity with a negligible cardiodepressive effect as compared to that of isolated administration of visken and leads to a decrease in the excessive production of catecholamines and glucocorticoids in the blood.", 
    "34": "The intraoperative medical management of eight children, ages 6--15 yr, with familial benign pheochromocytoma is described. All patients received a standardized regimen of alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs during a preoperative period ranging from 5 to 20 days. In six patients, all symptoms, including diaphoresis, palpitations and hypertension became well-controlled and the operative course was uneventful. In two others the cardiovascular symptoms persisted despite gradual increases in the above medications; in these two patients, the addition of sodium nitroprusside resulted in satisfactory titration of blood pressure and permitted performance of the operation with minimal complications. The specific treatment guidelines used in our patients may reduce the intraoperative complications previously encountered in this tumor.", 
    "35": "The acute haemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a selective adrenergic beta-1-receptor agonist, were studied in eight healthy male volunteers. Prenalterol was administered i.v. in five increasing doses to a cumulative dose of 5.55 mg. After the last dose of prenalterol, three doses of the selective adrenergic beta-1-receptor antagonist metoprolol were administered i.v. to a cumulative dose of 17.5 mg. After each dose, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), systolic time intervals (STI) and forearm blood flow (FBF) were determined. Prenalterol had the following effects: CO was significantly increased by 21.0% after the fourth dose, but the fifth dose did not further change CO. SV was unchanged after the first four doses, but after the fifth dose a significant decrease in SV of 7.0% was seen. Mean BP was increased significantly by 7.7%, but diastolic BP remained unchanged. HR was increased by 28.4%. Total peripheral resistance was reduced by 8.8%. STI were reduced significantly after the second dose, which indicates that prenalterol has a positive inotropic action. FBF was increased significantly after the fourth dose. After the third dose of metoprolol, the CO, SV, means BP, HR, STI and FBF had returned to their control values. It is concluded that prenalterol has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the myocardium, and that metoprolol is a specific antidote.", 
    "36": "In order to elucidate the role of the adrenergic nervous system in the mechanism of TSH release in men the effects of alpha- and beta-receptors blocking agents were studied in 11 healthy volunteers. Phentolamine administered iv as a bolus injection in a dose of 10 mg, significantly lowered the TSH release in basal condition and in response to TRH stimulation. However, propranolol in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg administered in the same fashion as phentolamine had no effect on the TSH secretion. The results obtained suggest that the alpha-receptors of the adrenergic system are involved in the physiological mechanism which stimulates TSH release in men.", 
    "37": "For the purpose of determining exercise intensity required for evaluating the effect of beta-blocking agents, the multi-stage treadmill exercise was carried out up to intensity of 85% of maximal oxygen intake (VO2max) after administration of beta-blocking agents in 7 healthy men. To obtain a stable dose response in the inhibitory effect of beta-blocking agents on heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (S-BP), the exercise intensity more than 65% of VO2max (75% of maximal heart rate) was needed. In order to evaluate the effect of befunolol (BFE), a submaximal treadmill exercise of 75% of the age adjusted predicted maximal heart rate was loaded in 6 healthy men at 1.5, 4, and 8 hours following a single oral administration of 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of BFE and 20 mg or 40 mg of propranolol. Simultaneously, the plasma concentration of BFE was determined 1.5, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the administration of BFE at each dose. In human serum, BFE was detected together with its metabolite, revealing a significant correlation between BFE and metabolite (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). Almost a certain rate of metabolite (4--5 times) was detected against BFE. As for the biological half life, it was 1.79 +/- 0.13 hours with BFE and 3.67 +/- 1.33 hours with metabolite. The inhibitory effect of BFE on HR and S-BP during exercise exhibited a dose response with the oral dose and its plasma concentration, and was almost twice as much as that of propranolol at the same dose. Accordingly, the myocardial oxygen consumption which may be represented as rate pressure product was inhibited twice as much as propranolol. BFE is characteristic of its more rapid elimination of its effect compared to the other beta-blocking agents. The decrease in the inhibitory effect of BFE or HR during exercise was about 1.8 times quicker than that of propranolol.", 
    "38": "The two optical isomers of propranolol caused a concentration-dependent increase in functional refractory period of the rat isolated left atrium. In this property the isomers were equipotent. Naradrenaline (1 X 10-(7) M) decreased the functional refractory period. This effect was completely reversed by (-)-propranolol. The (+)-isomer was much less potent than (-)-propranolol in antagonizing the effects of noradrenaline on functional refractory period.", 
    "39": "Ovarian tissue from immature rats treated with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) or PMSG and human chorionic gonadotrophin was incubated in Medium 199. Stimulation of the formation of cyclic AMP in follicular and luteal tissue by terbutaline (10(-5) mol/l), a selective beta 2-agonist, was blocked by butoxamine (10(-5) mol/l), a selective beta 2-antagonist, whereas practolol (10(-5) mol/l), a selective beta 1-antagonist, was ineffective. Propranolol (10(-5) mol/l) a non-selective beta-antagonist, butoxamine nor practolol affected the increase in cyclic AMP promoted by the addition of 1 microgram LH. Stimulation of the production of progesterone in both follicular and luteal tissue by terbutaline was blocked by butoxamine, but not by practolol. These findings indicated that beta-adrenergic stimulation of ovarian cyclic AMP and progesterone is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "40": "1 Atrial and ventricular chronotropic effects of acebutolol, metoprolol and propranolol were studied in conscious dogs with chronic heart-block. Ventricular beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity was assessed for the three dogs against isoprenaline (1 microgram/kg) under the same experimental conditions. 2 Acebutolol and metoprolol significantly increased atrial rate. The effect was proportional to the dose for acebutolol, independent for metoprolol. Propranolol had no significant effect on atrial rate. All three drugs significantly lowered ventricular rate in proportion to the dose. 3 Ventricular beta-blocking potencies of metoprolol and acebutolol were respectively 2 and 3 times weaker than that of propranolol as indicated by ED50 values. 4 The ventricular depressor effect observed was proportional to the degree of ventricular beta-blockade present, although this may not be the only factor involved.", 
    "41": "1 A method for measuring propranolol concentrations in plasma has been modified to permit estimations to be made on small volumes. The method has been used to correlate blockade of heart rate increases in response to intravenous isoprenaline, in both young and adult rabbits, with plasma concentrations of propranolol after subcutaneous injections of 2 or 4 mg/kg. It has been found that the relation between beta-adrenoceptor blockade and plasma concentrations is the same in rabbits as that determined by previous workers in man. 2 Adult Dutch dwarf rabbits were treated for 9 weeks twice daily subcutaneously with 2 mg/kg propranolol, or 10 mg/kg practolol, or with saline. 3 The treatment caused no change in heart weight in relation to body weight or in the water content of the hearts, in contrast to effects previously observed in young rabbits. 4 As in the young rabbits, treatment did cause a prolongation of action potential duration, as measured with intracellular electrodes in hearts of animals killed 24 h after the last dose of drug. 5 In another series of experiments, with a similar regime of treatment for 6 weeks, a significant reduction of diastolic blood pressure was observed in the propranolol group. 6 During the course of treatment and at the end, there was no change in the heart-rate increases observed in response to intravenous isoprenaline administered not less than 15 h after the previous dose of beta-blockers. Thus no functional alteration in sensitivity ot beta-adrenoceptor stimulation was apparent.", 
    "42": "The tolerance to strophanthin was studied in acute and subacute experiments on 76 cats at varying time after occlusion of the coronary artery branch. The beta-adrenoblocker alpheprol completely smoothed away the hypersensitivity to strophanthin after the coronary blood flow cessation while the alpha-adrenolytic tropaphen virtually did not affect the tolerance to strophanthin in intact animals even after experimental myocardial infarction.", 
    "43": "beta-Blocking drugs suppress plasma renin activity (PRA) promptly. The current study was undertaken to document the return of PRA once blockade is withdrawn. In addition, we have correlated the return of PRA with both fall in plasma propranolol levels and change in blood pressure (BP). Fourteen patients established a baseline PRA. Propranolol hydrochloriode, 40 mg twice daily, was given for seven days and withdrawn abruptly. The PRA, plasma propranolol level, and BP were measured one and 12 hours after withdrawal, then every 24 hours. The PRA returns to baseline 12 hours after cessation of therapy. After withdrawal of therapy, there seems to be a \"rebound\" phenomenon in PRA, with elevations of 70% above baseline. This rebound also is demonstrated by a nonsignificant rise in BP. Plasma propranolol levels fall by; 70% within 13 hours of withdrawal. The decrease in propranolol levels closely correlates with the rise in PRA.", 
    "44": "The synthesis of a series of (3-hydroxyprop-1-enyl)-substituted 1-(aryloxy)-3-(alkylamino)propan-2-ols is described. These compounds were investigated for their beta-adrenoreceptor blocking properties and their selective of action. Among the o-(hydroxypropenyl)-substituted derivatives we have found some potent noncardioselective beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents which have a greater blocking action on the beta 2 receptor, thus resembling propranolol. The p-(hydroxypropenyl)-substituted analogues were generally less potent and tended to be cardioselective. The structure-activity relationships are discussed in the light of the hypothesis that the cardioselective of p-amido-substituted (aryloxy)propanolamines is attributable, in part, to binding of the amide group to some additional site on the beta receptor; our findings argue against a similar interaction for the allylic hydroxyl group.", 
    "45": "The ability of timolol to act as a beta-adrenergic antagonist in the cornea and in the iris--ciliary body of albino rabbits is reported. In vitro, timolol potently blocks the isoproterenol-stimulated synthesis of cAMP. In the iris-ciliary body, the apparent inhibition constant (K1) for timolol is 0.6 nM, indicating that timolol is approximately seven times more potent than propranolol. Topical timolol (0.5% and 4%) rapidly inhibits the beta-adrenergic--stimulated synthesis of cAMP in both corneal and iris--ciliary body tissues. Within 3 hr, however, the iris--ciliary body tissue regains its ability to produce large amounts of cAMP when challenged in vitro with isoproterenol. The washout of timolol from corneal tissue is more protracted. Intraocular pressure measurements by anterior chamber cannulation of anesthetized rabbits indicate that topical timolol (0.5% and 4%) has no significant influence on intraocular pressure. These concentrations of timolol significantly decrease heart rate but do not affect femoral arterial blood pressure. Because of the marked potency of timolol clinically, we conclude that the effects of the drug in the rabbit do not completely account for its therapeutic efficacy in humans, which must depend on more complex pharmacological actions.", 
    "46": "Topical administration of 0.5% vanadate lowers intraocular pressure in monkey and rabbit eyes. This appears to be a consequence of a reduction in the rate of aqueous humor secretion, probably resulting from the inhibition of ciliary epithelium membrane. NaK ATPase. The ubiquitous vanadate and its interactions with catecholamines and ascorbate may play a role in regulating the sodium pump of the ciliary epithelium. Adrenergic blocking agents may also lower intraocular pressure by inhibiting the NaK ATPase of the ciliary epithelium.", 
    "47": "In this study we extended the characterization of outcome in 1214 medically treated patients with coronary disease by considering nonfatal infarction and death together as ischemic events. At 7 years, the cumulative event rate was 47% (18% for nonfatal infarction as the initial event and 29% for death as the initial event). In multivariable analysis of 81 baseline descriptors, 11 (six clinical and five catheterization) were independent predictors of events. Progressive chest pain, number of diseased vessels, left main stenosis and left ventricular (LV) function were the most important predictors. Progrressive pain was a more important predictor of total events than of survival alone. In patients with one-, two- or three-vessel disease and normal LV function, nonfatal infarcation accounted for at least 50% of initial events. In patients with left main disease or severe LV dysfunction, death was the predominant event. These results have important implications for interpreting the natural history of coronary artery disease.", 
    "48": "The intravenous infusion of high doses of histamine (400 micrograms base/min) produced only small increases in weight (approximately equal to +30 g) and lymph total protein concentration (+ 0.9 g/100 ml) in canine forelimbs perfused at constant inflow. The weight gain was associated with profound decreases in aortic pressure (112 to 30 mm Hg) and in forelimb perfusion pressure (105 to 75 mm Hg) and marked increases in forelimb skin small-vein pressure (from 12 to 25 mm Hg). After treatment with phentolamine, the intravenous infusion of these doses of histamine under the same conditions produced marked decreases in forelimb perfusion pressure (120 to 60 mm Hg) and failed to increase forelimb skin small-vein pressure, yet still produced only minimal increases in weight (+ 12 g) and lymph total protein concentration (+ 0.8 g/100 ml). Following treatment with both phentolamine and propranolol, the intravenous infusion of histamine caused very marked increases in forelimb weight (approximately equal to +75 g) and lymph total protein concentration (+ 2.9 g/100 ml). These marked increases in forelimb weight and lymph formation were associated with profound decreases in perfusion pressure (112 to 60 mm Hg) but no change in skin small-vein pressure relative to control. These same increases in weight and lymph total protein concentration were observed after treatment with propranolol alone. Thus, treatment with propranolol markedly increased net fluid filtration and protein efflux during intravenous infusions of massive doses of histamine, idicating that this edemogenic agent causes an endogenous release of catecholamines which tend to antagonize the direct actions of histamine on the microvascular membrane via stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "49": "The effects of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, on blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone were studied in 17 adult patients with essential hypertension. Following a total dose of 1 g labetalol administered over a 48-hour period, there was a rapid and significant fall in systolic and diastolic BP averaging 16,5 +/- 7,9%/14,8 +/- 7,5% respectively supine, 18,7 +/- 8,3%/17,8 +/- 7,2% standing and 23,9 +/- 7,1%/16,8 +/- 10,3% after moderate exercise; 24 hours after labetalol was discontinued, the BP had gone up but was still below pretreatment values. Bradycardia remained slight throughout. During treatment a significant decrease in PRA (mean : 45%) was observed in all patients and found to correlate in standing position with changes in standing and post-exercise mean arterial pressure. There was no significant changes in plasma aldosterone. Side-effects were mild and limited to tingling of the scalp in 5 patients. No clinical symptoms of postural hypotension were recorded.", 
    "50": "The effects of the long-acting beta-receptor blocking agent Nadolol on ventricular rate was evaluated by Holter monitoring in 14 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, in whom no effective control of heart rate could be obtained by digitalis only. There was a significant drop of heart rate after the treatment with 2 times 60 mg Nadolol daily to 70% of control values (ten patients treated for one week). Treatment with 120 mg Nadolol once daily proved to be equally effective in four patients. Reduction of heart rate was most marked in periods of physical activity, while there was only a small effect during periods of rest.", 
    "51": "Nineteen patients have been treated with timolol maleate (a non selective beta-blocking) and the decrease of their blood arterial pressure was correlated with the suppression of renine secretion. The patients which controlled their arterial pressure (63%) as well as those who did not (37%) showed a significative decrease of the plasmatic renine. The patients were diagnosed of essential hypertension, with normal renal function and formed an homogenous group. The sodium intake was similar in all of them. The results showed that although the beta-blocking can act in hypertensive patients through the suppression of the renine angiotensine system, this is not the only maintenance factor of the arterial pressure, nor its only way of action. A relevant point to be stressed in the possibility of ARP stimulation by walking, in spite of the beta-blocking, which means that this is not a total blocking or that there are other factors regulating the ARP secretion, and that act together with the autonomous nervous system.", 
    "52": "The effects of trinitrin and propranolol on left ventricular function were compared with those of saphenous bypass grafting in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Simultaneous echocardiograms, apexcardiograms and phonocardiograms were recorded and digitized before and after drug administration or operation. As expected, trinitrin caused a reduction in left ventricular cavity size, an increase in peak VCF and an increase in heart rate, while propranolol consistently reduced heart rate and peak VCF. Asynchronous onset of wall movement was unaffected by propranolol or trinitrin, but when present preoperatively, consistently improved after saphenous bypass grafting. Abnormalities of relaxation, usually due to asynchronous termination of contraction, were aggravated by trinitrin or propranolol in those patients in whom contraction was initially incoordinate, but after operation, they tended to improve along with systolic abnormalities. The time interval, Q to minimum LV cavity dimension is frequently reduced in patients with ischaemic heart disease, and treatment with propranolol increases the frequency of this abnormality. Saphenous bypass grafting, however, was associated with a consistent return towards normal, regardless of changes in heart rate. Thus although trinitrin, propranolol and saphenous bypass grafting all relieve angina, their effects on left ventricular function are significantly different.", 
    "53": "Reference is made to the preliminary results of an extensive investigation of the relationship between weather and the incidence of myocardial infarct in Rome hospital patients. An account is offered of the many relations between meteorological and psychic stress on the one hand, and cardiovascular disease on the other. Beta-blocking agents, tranquillisers (benzo-diazepines), and platelet antiaggregants are useful in this connection.", 
    "54": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril was tested on 19 patients with essential hypertension, WHO grade I or II. In 11 patients blood pressure levels returned to normal over an observation period of 12 weeks at a dose of 3 C 50-150 mg daily (group A). In eight patients with grade II hypertension the absolute blood-pressure reduction was the same, but did not reach normal levels (group B). Although additional intake of propranolol, at a dose of 3 X 40 mg daily, achieved further reduction, normal pressures were still not attained. Initial blood pressure levels were higher and plasma-renin activity lower in patients of group B than of group A. There was a definite rise in plasma-renin activity with captopril, but corresponding to the suppression of plasma-renin in severe hypertension it was less. There was a fall in plasma-aldosterone levels, corresponding to a reduced angiotensin II level as a result of inhibition of the converting enzyme. The fall in plasma-aldosterone activity was less in severe hypertension, although there was the same inhibition of converting enzyme activity in both groups. Normochromic anaemia was noted in three patients, requiring further observation and explanation. No patient developed orthostatic hypotension or reflex tachycardia.", 
    "55": "Newer antiarrhythmic drugs are tentatively classified on the basis of their influence on the transmembrane action potential, the fast sodium inward current and its kinetics, and the slow inward current which is primarily carried by calcium ions. Disopyramide is probably a quinidine-like antiarrhythmic drug, while the effects of aprindine, lorcainide, and tocainide resemble those of lidocaine. Mexiletine and propafenon cannot be classified definitely on the basis of the hitherto available electrophysiological data. Besides their effects on the fast inward current these substances may have additional calcium antagonistic properties.", 
    "56": "The effects of 100 mg indomethacin daily for three weeks on blood pressure and urinary excretion of prostaglandin F2 alpha were studied in a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of two groups of patients with essential hypertension, eight receiving propranolol and seven thiazide diuretics. Compared with placebo, adding indomethacin to the patients' established antihypertensive treatment increased blood pressure by 14/5 Hg supine and 16/9 mm Hg erect in the patients receiving propranolol, and by 13/9 mm Hg supine and 16/9 mm Hg erect in the patients receiving thiazide diuretics (all p less than or equal to 0.05). The excretion of the major urinary metabolite of prostaglandin F2 alpha was reduced by 67% in the propranolol-treated patients and by 57% in those receiving a thiazide diuretic. Body weight increased by 0 . 8 kg (propranolol) and 1 . 1 kg (thiazide diuretic) when indomethacin was given, but there were no significant changes in creatinine clearance, urinary sodium excretion, or packed cell volume in either treatment group. These results suggest that products formed by the arachidonic acid cyclo-oxygenase contribute to the regulation of blood pressure during treatment with both propranolol and thiazide diuretics. Inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase with indomethacin partially antagonises the hypotensive effect of these drugs.", 
    "57": "A group of 39 patients has been divided in three categories according to their plasmatic renine activity and the correlation of the hipotensive answer to the Timolol Maleate (betadrenergic blocking). The control is more favourable in the normorreninemic than in the hiporreninemic patients and, paradoxically, even more than in the hyperreninemic. This unexpected answer is probably due to the lowest sodium intake of this last group. Hyperreninemia is more than a factor determining their basal hypertension: it is a regulation factor by hiposodic diet and probably, drug resistant. Nor quantitative neither qualitative correlation among the basal plasmatic renine activity and the hipotensive activity has been observed."
