A concern is that several studies have reported a decline in the incidence of VF/PVT over the past few decades. One plausible explanation is that contemporary cardiovascular therapies, such as increased use of statin and beta blocker drugs, may shorten the duration of VF/PVT after arrest. As a result, EMS response time would become an increasingly important factor in the likelihood of a shockable presenting rhythm, and consequently, cardiac arrest survival.",

This compound was suggested previously to act as a natriuretic hormone based on its ability to block short circuit currents in a frog skin assay and to induce a sustained natriuresis when injected into rats (C. D. Cain et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2007: 17873-17878). The present communication describes the effects of the compound on renal clearance and hemodynamic parameters in male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on a normal salt (0.4-0.5%) diet. Intravenous administration of synthetic xanthurenic acid 8-o-\u03b2-d-glucoside in two consecutive incremental doses (6.3 and 31.5 nmol) resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05), in urine flow (43.91 \u00b1 6.31 \u03bcL/min vs. 10.54 \u00b1 2.21 \u03bcL/min), absolute rate of sodium excretion (3.99 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcEq/min vs. 1.15 \u00b1 \u03bcEq/min), and percentage sodium excretion (1.63 \u00b1 0.46% vs. 0.37 \u00b1 0.12%, peak response vs. baseline, respectively). The natriuretic/diuretic effect was associated also with a significant increase in potassium excretion. These effects were not related to changes in renal hemodynamics or in arterial blood pressure. Pretreatment with the sodium channel blocker, amiloride, completely abolished the natriuretic and kaluretic actions of the compound. Administration of the xanthurenic acid derivative caused a dose-related increase in urinary nitrite/nitrate excretion. Moreover, under chronic nitric oxide blockade by l-NG-Nitro-Arginine-Methyl-Esther (l-NAME) sodium excretion was similar in rats treated or untreated with the compound. Our data demonstrate that xanthurenic acid 8-o-\u03b2-d-glucoside has significant diuretic/natriuretic and kaluretic properties. An intact amiloride-sensitive sodium channel is required for the renal effects of the compound. The data further suggest that the natriuretic effect is mediated in part by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism.",

However, an existing lack of published examples contributes to some uncertainties about the reliability of their predictions of oral drug exposure. Developing and validating pediatric PBPK models for oral drug application shall enrich our knowledge about their limitations and lead to a better use of the generated data. This study was conducted to investigate how whole-body PBPK models describe the oral pharmacokinetics of sotalol over the entire pediatric age. Two leading software tools for whole-body PBPK modeling: Simcyp\u00ae (Simcyp Ltd, Sheffield, UK) and PK-SIM\u00ae (Bayer Technology Services GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany), were used. Each PBPK model was first validated in adults before scaling to children. Model input parameters were collected from the literature and clinical data for 80 children were used to compare predicted and observed values. The results obtained by both models were comparable and gave an adequate description of sotalol pharmacokinetics in adults and in almost all pediatric age groups. Only in neonates, the mean ratio(Obs/Pred) for any PK parameter exceeded a twofold error range, 2.56 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.10-3.49) and 2.15 (95% CI, 1.77-2.99) for area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the first to the last concentration point and maximal concentration (Cmax) using SIMCYP\u00ae and 2.37 (95% CI, 1.76-3.25) for time to reach Cmax using PK-SIM\u00ae.

We found that MS fibroblasts showed increased SMAD4 protein levels, impaired matrix deposition, and altered expression of genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases and related inhibitors. Increased TGF-\u03b2 signaling and progression of aortic root dilation in Marfan syndrome can be prevented by the antihypertensive drug losartan, a TGF-\u03b2 antagonists and angiotensin-II type 1 receptor blocker.

    "27": "The reconsolidation hypothesis states that memories, when reactivated, enter a transient, labile state followed by a re-stabilization termed reconsolidation. By affecting the reconsolidation process, memory persistence can be influenced, leading to memory enhancement or decrement. This is a time-dependent process and the result of modulating reconsolidation is present only after the reconsolidation process is completed. Historically, reconsolidation research has been performed on non-human animals, since the methods originally used for reconsolidation disruption are not safe. However, there now exist several techniques safe for humans, and consequently, in recent years, papers on human reconsolidation have emerged. Here, the existing literature on human reconsolidation is reviewed and discussed, including studies on fear memories, appetitive memories, procedural memories, and declarative memories. Methods of memory reactivation are compared between studies, and the consistency and lack of consistency in results over reactivation methods and memory types are discussed. These results provide future challenges, both experimental and clinical, in defining the boundary conditions and mechanisms governing the reconsolidation phenomenon.

In this work, we investigated the role of \u03b1- and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors on the function of monocyte/macrophages during rest and exercise. Adult male Wistar rats were i.p. administered (100 \u03bcL/100 g) with specific adrenergic antagonists before an acute moderate exercise bout: prazosin (\u03b11-specific antagonist 2 mg/kg), propranolol (unspecific \u03b21/\u03b22 antagonist 10 mg/kg), double blockade (\u03b11 and \u03b21/\u03b22), or phosphate-buffered saline (control). Acute exercise consisted in a single swimming session of moderate intensity (5% body weight overload on the chest) for 60 min. Control groups (rest) received the same antagonists and were killed 60 min after drug administration. Exercise increased phagocytic capacity (1.7-fold, p\u2009<\u20090.05), NO\u02d9 production (5.24 fold, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) expression (by 58.1%), thus suggesting macrophage activation. The \u03b2-adrenoreceptor blockade did not change this behavior. In resting animals, \u03b11 antagonist, as well as the double (\u03b11/\u03b2) blockade, however, further increased phagocytic capacity (by up to 261%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), NO\u02d9 production (by up to 328%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and the expressions of NOS2 (by 182%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and HSP70 (by 42.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.01) suggesting a tonic inhibitory effect of \u03b11 stimulation on macrophage activation. In exercised animals, \u03b11-blockade showed similar enhancing effect on phagocytic indices and expressions of NOS and HSP70, particularly in double-blocked groups, although NO\u02d9 production was found to be reduced in exercised animals submitted to both \u03b1- and \u03b2-blockade. Redox (glutathione) status and lipoperoxidation were evaluated in all test groups and approximately paralleled macrophage NO\u02d9 production. We suggest the prevalence of a peripheral \u03b11-adrenoreceptor inhibitory tonus that limits macrophage responsiveness but operates differently after physical exercise.",

In each diet group, mice were treated with either vehicle (VEH) or propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist. Over 12-weeks, \u03b2-blockade mitigated body weight and fat mass increases induced by the high calorie diet. Femoral trabecular bone mineral density and the expression levels of osteogenic marker genes in bone marrow cells were reduced in HIGHVEH and LOWVEH mice, and BB significantly attenuated this decline only in HIGH mice. In summary, the magnitude of bone loss induced by low calorie diet was greater than that caused by high calorie diet in growing mice, and \u03b2-blockade mitigated high calorie diet-induced bone loss.",

Although early generations of computed tomographyscanners are not applicable to be tailored according to patients' heart rate, a low and regular heart rate is possible to be achieved by the administration of medications according to the beta-blocker protocol.

    "48": "Fear memory enhances connectivity in cortical and limbic circuits but whether treatments disrupting fear reset connectivity to pre-trauma level is unknown. Here we report that C56BL/6J mice exposed to a tone-shock association in context A (conditioning), and briefly re-exposed to the same tone-shock association in context B (reactivation), exhibit strong freezing to the tone alone delivered 48 h later in context B (long term fear memory). This intense fear response is associated with a massive increase in dendritic spines and phospho-Erk (p-ERK) signaling in basolateral amygdala (BLA) but neurons. We then show that propranolol (a central/peripheral \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blocker) administered before, but not after, the reactivation trial attenuates long term fear memory assessed drug free 48 h later, and completely prevents the increase in spines and p-ERK signaling in BLA neurons. An increase in spines, but not of p-ERK, was also detected in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) of the conditioned mice. DH spines, however, were unaffected by propranolol suggesting their independence from the ERK/\u03b2-ARs cascade. We conclude that propranolol selectively blocks dendritic spines and p-ERK signaling enhancement in the BLA; its effect on fear memory is, however, less pronounced suggesting that the persistence of spines at other brain sites decreases the sensitivity of the fear memory trace to treatments selectively targeting \u03b2 ARs in the BLA.", 
    "49": "Beta blockers are widely used pharmaceuticals that have been detected in the environment. Interactions between beta blockers and dissolved organic matter (DOM) may mutually alter their environmental behaviors. To assess this potential, propranolol (PRO) was used as a model beta blocker to quantify the complexation with DOM from different sources using the fluorescence quenching titration method. The sources of studied DOM samples were identified by excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMs) combined with fluorescence regional integration analysis. The results show that PRO intrinsic fluorescence was statically quenched by DOM addition. The resulting binding constants (log K oc) ranged from 3.90 to 5.20, with the surface-water-filtered DOM samples claiming the lower log K oc and HA having the highest log K oc. Log K oc is negatively correlated with the fluorescence index, biological index, and the percent fluorescence response (P i,n) of protein-like region (P I,n) and the P i,n of microbial byproduct-like region (P II,n) of DOM EEMs, while it is correlated positively with humification index and the P i,n of UVC humic-like region (P III,n). These results indicate that DOM samples from allochthonous materials rich in aromatic and humic-like components would strongly bind PRO in aquatic systems, and autochthonous DOM containing high protein-like components would bind PRO more weakly.", 
    "50": "A pathophysiological model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) posits that an overly strong stress response at the time of the traumatic event leads to overconsolidation of the event's memory in part through a central \u03b2-adrenergic mechanism. We hypothesized that the presence of a \u03b2-blocker in the patient's brain at the time of the traumatic event would reduce the PTSD outcome by blocking this effect. The unpredictable, uncontrollable discharge of an implantable intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) is experienced by most patients as highly stressful, and it has previously been shown to be capable of causing PTSD symptoms. The present pilot study evaluated a convenience sample of 18 male cardiac patients who had been taking either a lipophilic \u03b2-blocker (which penetrates the blood-brain barrier) or a hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker (which does not) at the time of a discharge of their ICD. The self- report PTSD Checklist-Specific Version quantified 17 PTSD symptoms pertaining to the ICD discharge during the month preceding the evaluation. There was a statistical trend for patients who had been taking a lipophilic \u03b2-blocker at the time of the ICD discharge to have (35%) less severe PTSD symptoms than patients who had been taking a hydrophilic \u03b2-blocker (one-tailed p=0.07, g=0.64). Further, prospective, randomized, controlled studies are suggested.", 
    "51": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, which is often associated with elevated catecholamines. More than half of patients with metastatic NB relapse and survival is extremely poor with current therapies. In a high-throughput screen of FDA-approved drugs we identified anti-NB activity for the nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol hydrochloride. Propranolol inhibited growth of a panel of fifteen NB cell lines irrespective of MYCN status, and treatment induced apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Activity was dependent on inhibition of the \u03b22, and not \u03b21, adrenergic receptor, and treatment resulted in activation of p53 and p73 signaling in vitro. The majority of NB cell lines and primary tumors express \u03b22 adrenergic receptor and higher mRNA levels correlate with improved patient survival, but expression levels did not correlate with in vitro sensitivity to propranolol. Furthermore, propranolol is synergistic with the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38 and propranolol inhibits growth of NB xenografts in vivo at doses similar to those used to treat infants with hemangiomas and hypertension. Taken together, our results suggest that propranolol has activity against NB and thus should be considered in combination treatments for patients with relapsed and refractory NB.", 
    "52": "L-type Ca(2+) channels (LTCC) play a crucial role in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. We previously found that in failing ventricular myocytes of mice chronically treated with isoproterenol, basal t-tubular (TT) LTCC activity was halved by activation of protein phosphatase (PP)2A whereas basal surface sarcolemmal (SS) LTCC activity was doubled by inhibition of PP1. Interestingly, chronic treatment of these mice with pertussis toxin almost completely normalized TT and SS LTCC densities and cardiac contractility. In the present study, we therefore sought to identify the Gi/o protein-coupled receptors in cardiac myocytes (i.e. \u03b22-adrenergic, M2-muscarinic and A1-adenosine receptors) that are responsible for these abnormalities in heart failure by chronically administrating mice a selective antagonist of each receptor (ICI118,551, atropine and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropilxanthine (DPCPX), respectively) with isoproterenol. Compared with mice treated with isoproterenol alone, mice treated with isoproterenol plus ICI118,551 or atropine, but not DPCPX showed significantly lower lung weight/tibial length, higher fractional shortening, lower left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and higher dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin. In addition, ventricular myocytes of mice treated with isoproterenol plus ICI118,551 or atropine, but not DPCPX exhibited significantly higher TT and lower SS LTCC current densities than those of mice treated with isoproterenol alone due to normalization of the PP activities. These results indicate that \u03b22-adrenergic, M2-muscarinic, but not A1-adenosine receptors contribute to reduced ventricular contractility at least partially by decreasing basal TT LTCC activity in heart failure. Therefore, antagonists of \u03b22-adrenergic and/or M2-muscarinic receptors can be good adjuncts to \u03b21-adrenergic receptor antagonists in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "53": "Nebivolol, a third generation beta1-blocker was previously found to reduce the size of atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of orally administered nevibolol on the components of the atherosclerotic plaque in apoE-deficient mice. The quantitative evaluation of cross-sectioned plaques stained by histological and immunohistochemical techniques revealed that treatment with nebivolol (2.0 \u03bcol per kg b.w.) for 4 months caused a decrease in the necrotic core area (by 46%, p=0.03), density of CD68+ macrophages (by 41%, p=0.008) and CD3+ lymphocytes (by 16%, p=0.03), collagen content (by 49%, p=0.008) and the activity area of metalloproteinases (by 48%, p=0.008), as well as an increase in the smooth muscle content of the fibromuscular cap (by 46%, p=0.008). These effects suggest that nebivolol suppresses the inflammatory/immune processes in the plaque and enhances its stability.", 
    "54": "Although cocaine ingestion may cause or contribute to myocardial infarction (MI), few contemporary data are available describing cocaine-associated MI. We describe the characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients with MI and recent cocaine use from the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With The Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) program. The study population was 102,952 patients enrolled in the American College of Cardiology ACTION Registry-GWTG from July 2008 to March 31, 2010 from 460 sites across the United States. Cocaine exposure was defined as self-reported cocaine use within the last 72 hours or a positive urine test for cocaine. Demographics and medical history, presenting characteristics, treatments, and in-hospital outcomes were reported on a standard case record form. A total of 924 patients (0.9%) were cocaine positive. Compared with cocaine-negative patients, cocaine-positive patients were younger and predominantly men with fewer cardiovascular risk factors. There was a higher percentage of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (46.3% vs 39.7%) and cardiogenic shock at presentation in the cocaine-positive group, but the percentage of multivessel coronary artery disease was lower (53.3% vs 64.5%). Beta blockers within 24 hours (85.8% vs 90.1%, p <0.0001) and drug-eluting stents (40.1% vs 68.8%, p <0.0001 in patients with non-STEMI; 27.6% vs 54.6%, p <0.0001 in patients with STEMI) were used less commonly in cocaine-positive patients. Multivariable-adjusted in-hospital mortality was similar between cocaine-positive and cocaine-negative patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.44, p value = 0.98). In conclusion cocaine-positive patients with acute coronary syndrome are younger with fewer risk factors, multivessel coronary artery disease and lower drug-eluting stent and \u03b2-blocker usage. Cocaine use was not associated with in-hospital mortality.",

Participants were randomly assigned to chlorthalidone-based stepped-care therapy (n = 2,365) or placebo (n = 2,371) for 4.5 years, and all participants were advised to take active therapy thereafter. At the 22-year follow-up, the gain in life expectancy free from CV death in the active treatment group was 145 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 23 to 260, p = 0.012). The gain in overall life expectancy was smaller (105 days, 95% CI -39 to 242, p = 0.073) because of a 40-day (95% CI -87 to 161) decrease in survival from non-CV death. Compared with an age- and gender-matched cohort, participants had markedly higher overall life expectancy (Wilcoxon p = 0.00001) and greater chance of reaching the ages of 80 (81.3% vs 57.6%), 85 (58.1% vs 37.4%), 90 (30.5% vs 22.0%), 95 (11.9% vs 8.8%), and 100 years (3.7% vs 2.8%).

    "56": "Patients surviving a variceal bleed are at high risk of re-bleeding with a mortality of 25-50% during a 1-2 year follow-up. Several studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated reduced rates of oesophageal variceal rebleeding with the use of \u03b2-blockers. However, their use can be limited by contraindications or intolerance to therapy. Other trials have shown that addition of nitrates may improve the efficacy of \u03b2-blockers in prevention of variceal re-bleeding. Endoscopic variceal band ligation (VBL) has been shown in meta-analyses to decrease the rates of rebleeding and mortality compared with endoscopic sclerotherapy. Studies comparing combined drug therapy with VBL have shown similar rebleeding rates although there is a suggestion that survival may be higher in those given drug therapy. Recent data suggest that combined VBL and drug therapy reduces the risk of rebleeding from oesophageal varices compared with either therapy alone; however there appears to be no reduction in overall mortality.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HRP with a large dose of 1\u2009mg/kg/d on glucose status in the rats treated neonatally with monosodium L-glutamate (MSG). At the age of 8 weeks, the MSG rats were randomly divided into MSG control group, HRP treated group with minipump (MSG-HRP group), losartan treated group (MSG-L group), and HRP and losartan cotreated group (MSG-HRP-L group) and fed with high-fat diet for 4 weeks. Losartan but not HRP increased the levels of insulin releasing and ameliorate glucose status although both losartan and HRP improved insulin sensitivity. On the one hand, both losartan and HRP decreased levels of pancreatic local Ang-II and NADPH oxidase activity as well as its subunits P(22phox). On the other hand, losartan but not HRP decreased \u03b1 -cell mass and number of PCNA-positive cells located periphery of the islets and decreased picrosirius red stained area in islets. HRP ameliorating insulin resistance but not \u03b2 -cell functions leads to hyperglycemia in the end in male MSG rats, and the dual characters of HRP may partly account for the phenomenon.", 
    "59": "BP variability (BPV) is an important predictor of outcomes in the general population, but its association with clinical outcomes in hemodialysis patients is not clear. We identified 11,291 patients starting dialysis in 2003-2008 and followed them through December 31, 2008 (median=22 months). Predialysis systolic BPV was assessed over monthly intervals. Outcomes included factors associated with BPV, mortality (all-cause and cardiovascular), and first cardiovascular event (cardiovascular death or hospitalization). Patients' mean age was 62 years, 55% of patients were men, and 58% of patients were white. Modifiable factors associated with higher BPV included obesity, higher calcium-phosphate product levels, and lower hemoglobin concentration; factors associated with lower BPV included greater fluid removal, achievement of prescribed dry weight during dialysis, higher hemoglobin concentration, and antihypertensive regimens without \u03b2-blockers or renin-angiotensin system blocking agents. In total, 3200 deaths occurred, including 1592 cardiovascular deaths. After adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and clinical factors, higher predialysis BPV was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] per 1 SD increase in BPV, 1.13 to 1.22), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.24), and first cardiovascular event (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.15). Results were similar when BPV was categorized in tertiles and patients were stratified by baseline systolic BP. In summary, predialysis systolic BPV is an important, potentially modifiable risk factor for death and cardiovascular outcomes in incident hemodialysis patients. Studies of BP management in dialysis patients should focus on both absolute BP and BPV.",

There is a general consensus that oral \u03b1-methyldopa and parenteral labetalol are the drugs of choice for nonsevere and severe hypertension in pregnancy, respectively. Long-acting nifedipine is recommended by various guidelines as an alternative for first-line and second-line therapy in nonsevere and severe hypertension. The safety of \u03b2-blockers, atenolol in particular, in early and late stages of pregnancy is unresolved; their use is contraindicated according to several guidelines. Diuretic-associated harmful effects on maternal and fetal outcomes are controversial: their use is discouraged in pregnancy. It is important to develop specific guidelines for treating hypertension in special groups such as adult females of childbearing age and sexually active female adolescents to minimize the risk of adverse effects of drugs on the fetus. In several guidelines, the antihypertensive classes, recommended drug(s), intended drug formulation, and route of administration are not explicit. These omissions should be addressed in future guideline revisions in order to enhance the guidelines' utility and credibility in clinical practice.", 
    "69": "Sensitive and selective liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis is a powerful and essential tool for metabolite identification in drug discovery and development. An MS(2) (or tandem, MS/MS) mass spectrum is acquired from the fragmentation of a precursor ion by multiple methods including information-dependent acquisition (IDA), SWATH (sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment-ion spectra), and MS(All) (also called MS(E)) techniques. We compared these three techniques in their capabilities to produce comprehensive MS(2) data by assessing both metabolite MS(2) acquisition hit rate and the quality of MS(2) spectra. Rat liver microsomal incubations from eight test compounds were analyzed with four methods (IDA, MMDF (multiple mass defect filters)-IDA, SWATH, or MS(All)) using an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-qudrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF MS) platform. A combined total of 227 drug-related materials (DRM) were detected from all eight test article incubations, and among those, 5% and 4% of DRM were not triggered for MS(2) acquisition with IDA and MMDF-IDA methods, respectively. When the same samples were spiked to an equal volume of blank rat urine (urine sample), the DRM without MS(2) acquisition increased to 29% and 18%, correspondingly. In contrast, 100% of DRM in both matrixes were subjected to MS(2) acquisition with either the SWATH or MS(All) method. However, the quality of the acquired MS(2) spectra decreased in the order of IDA, SWATH, and MS(All) methods. An average of 10, 9, and 6 out of 10 most abundant ions in MS(2) spectra were the real product ions of DRM detected in microsomal samples from IDA, SWATH, and MS(All) methods, respectively. The corresponding numbers declined to 9, 6, and 3 in the urine samples. Overall, IDA-based methods acquired qualitatively better MS(2) spectra but with a lower MS(2) acquisition hit rate than the other two methods. SWATH outperformed the MS(All) method given its better quality of MS(2) spectra with an identical MS(2) acquisition hit rate.",

In addition to the BCS class, its therapeutic index, pharmacokinetic properties, data related to the possibility of excipient interactions, and reported BE/bioavailability problems are taken into consideration. Qualitative compositions of IR tablet dosage forms of bisoprolol with a marketing authorization (MA) in ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation) countries are tabulated. It was inferred that these tablets had been demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the innovator product. No reports of failure to meet BE standards have been made in the open literature.

    "77": "Compensation has been widely applied to explain neuroimaging findings in neuropsychiatric patients. Functional compensation is often invoked when patients display equal performance and increased neural activity in comparison to healthy controls. According to the compensatory hypothesis increased activity allows the brain to maintain cognitive performance despite underlying neuropathological changes. Due to methodological and pathology-related issues, however, the functional relevance of the increased activity and the specific brain regions involved in the compensatory response remain unclear. An experimental approach that allows a transient induction of compensatory responses in the healthy brain could help to overcome these issues. To this end we used the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol to pharmacologically induce sub-optimal noradrenergic signaling in healthy participants. In two independent functional MRI (fMRI) experiments participants received either placebo or propranolol before they underwent a cognitive challenge (Experiment 1: working memory; Experiment 2: emotional learning: Pavlovian fear conditioning). In Experiment 1 propranolol had no effects on working memory performance, but evoked stronger activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In Experiment 2 propranolol produced no effects on emotional memory formation, but evoked stronger activity in the right IFG. The present finding that sub-optimal beta-adrenergic signaling did not disrupt performance and concomitantly increased IFG activity is consistent with, and extends, current perspectives on functional compensation. Together, our findings suggest that under conditions of impaired noradrenergic signaling, heightened activity in brain regions located within the cognitive control network, particularly the IFG, may reflect compensatory operations subserving the maintenance of behavioral performance.", 
    "78": "Patients undergoing a lateral thoracotomy for pulmonary resection have moderate to severe pain postoperatively that is often treated with opioids. Opioid side effects such as respiratory depression can be devastating in patients with already compromised respiratory function. This prospective double-blinded clinical trial examined the analgesic effects and safety of a dexmedetomidine infusion for postthoracotomy patients when administered on a telemetry nursing floor, 24 to 48 hours after surgery, to determine if the drug's known early opioid-sparing properties were maintained. Thirty-eight thoracotomy patients were administered dexmedetomidine intraoperatively and overnight postoperatively and then randomized to receive placebo or dexmedetomidine titrated from 0.1 to 0.5 \u03bcg\u00b7kg\u00b7h(-1) the day following surgery for up to 24 hours on a telemetry floor. Opioids via a patient-controlled analgesia pump were available for both groups, and vital signs including transcutaneous carbon dioxide, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, and pain and sedation scores were monitored. The dexmedetomidine group used 41% less opioids but achieved pain scores equal to those of the placebo group. The mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure were lower in the dexmedetomidine group but sedation scores were better. The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were similar in the two groups. Mild hypercarbia occurred in both groups, but periods of significant respiratory depression were noted only in the placebo group. Significant hypotension was noted in one patient in the dexmedetomidine group in conjunction with concomitant administration of a beta-blocker agent. The placebo group reported a higher number of opioid-related adverse events. In conclusion, the known opioid-sparing properties of dexmedetomidine in the immediate postoperative period are maintained over 48 hours.",

Therefore in the current study, the role of \u03b23-adrenoceptors in modulating efferent neurotransmission was evaluated. The effects of \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonism on neurogenic contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) were compared with effects on contractions induced by exogenous acetylcholine (Ach) and \u03b1\u03b2-methylene adenosine triphosphate (\u03b1\u03b2-meATP) in order to determine the site of action. Isoproterenol inhibited EFS-induced neurogenic contractions of human bladder (pD2=6.79; Emax=65%). The effect of isoproterenol was selectively inhibited by the \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist L-748,337 (pKB=7.34). Contractions induced by exogenous Ach (0.5-1\u03bcM) were inhibited 25% by isoproterenol (3\u03bcM) while contractions to 10Hz in the same strip were inhibited 67%. The selective \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonist CL-316,243 inhibited EFS-induced neurogenic contractions of rat bladder (pD2=7.83; Emax=65%). The effects of CL-316,243 were inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by L-748,337 (pA2=6.42). Contractions induced by exogenous Ach and \u03b1\u03b2-meATP were significantly inhibited by CL-316,243, 29% and 40%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the activation of \u03b23-adrenoceptors inhibits neurogenic contractions of both rat and human urinary bladder. Contractions induced by exogenously applied parasympathetic neurotransmitters are also inhibited by \u03b23-agonism however the effect is clearly less than on neurogenic contractions (particularly in human), suggesting that in addition to a direct effect on smooth muscle, activation of prejunctional \u03b23-adrenoceptors may inhibit neurotransmitter release.",

A proniosome gel type transdermal delivery system of Atenolol was prepared and extensively studied both in vitro drug release and ex vivo permeation studies. The prepared formulations were evaluated for vesicle size, entrapment efficiency, in vitro drug loading, and drug release studies. The release of drug had shown considerable improvement in controlled manner from the prepared gel formulation. It was observed that Span 40 & 60 (A 8) based formulations shows vesicles of minimum size and higher entrapment efficiency compared to the other formulations. Proniosomal transdermal therapeutic system (A 8) was found to be the optimized formulation as it possess good drug release and shows permeation in a steady-state manner over a desired period of time. Also the drug diffusion across snake sheded skin, guinea pig abdomen skin, albino rat, porcine ear correlates better with in vitro drug release studies. The formulation was found to be stable when stored at room temperature and at refrigeration temperature (4 \u00b1 2\u00b0C) for 90 days.", 
    "92": "There is considerable interest, from both a basic and clinical standpoint, in gaining a greater understanding of how pharmaceutical or behavioral manipulations alter fear extinction in animals. Not only does fear extinction in rodents model exposure therapy in humans, where the latter is a cornerstone of behavioral intervention for anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and specific phobias, but also understanding more about extinction provides basic information into learning and memory processes and their underlying circuitry. In this paper, we briefly review three principal approaches that have been used to modulate extinction processes in animals and humans: a purely pharmacological approach, the more widespread approach of combining pharmacology with behavior, and a purely behavioral approach. The pharmacological studies comprise modulation by: brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), d-cycloserine, serotonergic and noradrenergic drugs, neuropeptides, endocannabinoids, glucocorticoids, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and others. These studies strongly suggest that extinction can be modulated by drugs, behavioral interventions, or their combination, although not always in a lasting manner. We suggest that pharmacotherapeutic manipulations provide considerable promise for promoting effective and lasting fear reduction in individuals with anxiety disorders.

    "93": "In the present study, we examined the effect of stress-related catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline on macrophage expression of a new host defense factor REDD1 using murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and murine peritoneal macrophages. Short-term adrenaline exposure (15-60 min) upregulated REDD1 mRNA expression and its protein synthesis in macrophages. This adrenaline-induced REDD1 expression was completely blocked by \u03b22-adrenoceptor selective antagonist ICI 118,551, whereas \u03b22-adrenoceptor specific agonist salmeterol markedly enhanced REDD1 expression. Moreover, noradrenaline increased REDD1 mRNA expression at doses higher than the effective doses of adrenaline. The effect of adrenaline on REDD1 mRNA expression was mimicked by treatment with membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP. Thus, increased intracellular cAMP level resulting from \u03b22-adrenoceptor stimulation appeared to be responsible for adrenaline-induced REDD1 mRNA expression. However, inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) activity had no significant effect on REDD1 mRNA expression after \u03b22-adrenoceptor stimulation. In addition, exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac) agonist 8-CPT-20-O-Me-cAMP had no effect on REDD1 mRNA expression. Thus, \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated increase in cAMP levels seems to induce REDD1 mRNA expression in macrophages through a PKA- and Epac-independent pathway.",

First described in 1985, there are 10 reported cases of adrenergic urticaria in the English-language medical literature. Episodes are caused by various triggers, including emotional upset, coffee, and chocolate, during which serum catecholamines and IgE are elevated, whereas histamine and serotonin levels remain within normal limits. The precise mechanisms leading to the pathogenesis of adrenergic urticaria have yet to be elucidated. Diagnosis can be made by intradermal injection of epinephrine or norepinephrine, which reproduces the characteristic rash, or by clinical observation. Trigger avoidance and oral propranolol are currently the best known treatments for adrenergic urticaria. Nonspecific therapies, including tranquilizers and antihistamines, may also ease symptoms. This article explores the pathophysiology of adrenergic urticaria and proposes a mechanism by which propranolol treats the condition.",

    "143": "Arterial hypertension is one of the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases and one of the most important causes of heart failure with low or preserved ejection fraction. Although many drugs are highly effective in lowering blood pressure, the optimal treatment for preventing progression to heart failure is still uncertain. Beta-blockers, a class of drugs with well-established indications and benefits for both hypertension and heart failure seem to show different pharmacological properties with different consequences on the cardiovascular hemodynamic. The third class beta-blocker nebivolol, by its particular mechanism of vasodilatation mediated by nitric oxide release, has been proven to provide substantial benefits beyond the effect of blood pressure lowering, such as reversal of endothelial dysfunction, improvement of ventricular-arterial coupling, improvement of coronary flow reserve and an overall improvement of the diastolic function which is independent of the changes in ventricular geometry. Thus, nebivolol seems to be superior to other \"classical\" beta-blockers for the reversal of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive patients, before the onset of overt heart failure. This could be an important fact to take into consideration especially for the early stages of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction for which the optimal management is not established yet.",

Echocardiographic super-responders to CRT were treated with higher average dosages of ACE-I/ARBs (68.1 vs. 52.4%, P < 0.01) and beta-blockers (59 vs. 42.2%, P < 0.01). During follow-up, the average dosage of loop diuretics was decreased by 20% in super-responders, but increased by 30% in non-super-responders (P < 0.03).",

Fb spontaneously differentiated to proliferating MyoFb (p-MyoFb) with stress fibre formation decorated with alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) promoted differentiation into \u03b1-SMA-positive MyoFb showing near the absence of proliferation, i.e. non-p-MyoFb. SD-208, a TGF-\u03b2-receptor-I (TGF-\u03b2-RI) kinase blocker, inhibited p-MyoFb differentiation as shown by stress fibre absence, low \u03b1-SMA expression, and high proliferation levels. Fb seeded in collagen matrices induced no contraction, whereas p-MyoFb and non-p-MyoFb induced 2.5- and four-fold contraction. Fb produced little collagen but high levels of interleukin-10. Non-p-MyoFb had high collagen production and high monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 levels. Transcriptome analysis indicated differential activation of gene networks related to differentiation of MyoFb (e.g. paxilin and PAK) and reduced proliferation of non-p-MyoFb (e.g. cyclins and cell cycle regulation). Dedifferentiation of p-MyoFb with stress fibre de-polymerization, but not of non-p-MyoFb, was induced by SD-208 despite maintained stress. Stress fibre de-polymerization could also be induced by mechanical strain release in p-MyoFb and non-p-MyoFb (2-day cultures in unrestrained 3-D collagen matrices). Only p-MyoFb showed true dedifferentiation after long-term 3-D cultures.",

Floating pulsatile concept was applied to increase the gastric residence of the dosage form having lag phase followed by a burst release. The prepared system consisted of two parts: a core tablet containing the active ingredient and an erodible outer shell with gas generating agent. The rapid release core tablet (RRCT) was prepared by using superdisintegrants with active ingredient. Press coating of optimized RRCT was done by polymer. A 3\u00b2 full factorial design was used for optimization. The amount of Polyox WSR205 and Polyox WSR N12K was selected as independent variables. Lag period, drug release, and swelling index were selected as dependent variables. Floating pulsatile release formulation (FPRT) F13 at level 0 (55\u2009mg) for Polyox WSR205 and level +1 (65\u2009mg) for Polyox WSR N12K showed lag time of 4\u2009h with >90% drug release.

Surviving pigs were euthanatized at 24 h after ROSC, and the hearts were removed for analysis by electron microscopy, Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Compared with the EP and SA groups, EE group had a better outcome in hemodynamic function, (improved dp/dt maxima and minima and cardiac output) (P<0.05), and improved oxygen metabolism (oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption) (P<0.05), which suggesting that EE can protect myocardial tissue from injury and improve post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction.

Meanwhile, sympathetic hyperactivity is an important factor in inducing cardiac remodeling. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of beta-adrenoceptor signaling pathways would help to find better ways to reverse the adverse remodeling. Here, we reviewed five pathways, namely mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, Gs-AC-cAMP signaling, Ca(2+)-calcineurin-NFAT/CaMKII-HDACs signaling, PI3K signaling and beta-3 adrenergic signaling, in cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, we constructed a cardiac-remodeling-specific regulatory network including miRNA, transcription factors and target genes within the five pathways. Both experimental and clinical studies have documented beneficial effects of beta blockers in cardiac remodeling; nevertheless, different blockers show different extent of therapeutic effect. Exploration of the underlying mechanisms could help developing more effective drugs. Current evidence of treatment effect of beta blockers in remodeling was also reviewed based upon information from experimental data and clinical trials. We further discussed the mechanism of how beta blockers work and why some beta blockers are more potent than others in treating cardiac remodeling within the framework of cardiac remodeling network.",

Evidence-based guidelines for the care of patients with acute coronary syndrome are not followed up to 25% of the time. Antiplatelet therapy, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins constitute the foundation of medical therapy. Early noninvasive stress testing is an important risk assessment tool, especially in patients who do not undergo revascularization. Discharge preparation should include a review of medications, referral for exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, activity recommendations, education about lifestyle modification and recognition of cardiac symptoms, and a clear follow-up plan. Because nonadherence to medications is common in patients after a myocardial infarction and is associated with increased mortality risk, modifiable factors associated with medication self-discontinuation should be addressed before discharge. Structured discharge processes should be used to enhance communication and facilitate the transition from the hospital to the family physician's care.",

Reperfusion-induced increase in dialysate myoglobin level was suppressed in the pro(2)-pre, pro(5)-pre and zat-pre groups in comparison with vehicle group. The ratios of reperfusion/ischemia myoglobin level in pro (2)-pre and pro(5)-pre were lower than those in vehicle and zat-pre. Reperfusion-induced increase in myoglobin level was suppressed by administration of propranolol immediately before reperfusion.",

These antihypertensive therapies were given for at least one week before the operation and continued thereafter. IMA blood flow volume was measured for one minute just before cardiopulmonary bypass (measurement A) and before left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-left anterior descending (LAD) artery anastomosis (measurement B) in the three groups.

    "174": "The concept of ''diastolic'' heart failure grew out of the observation that many patients who have the symptoms and signs of heart failure had an apparently normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Thus it was assumed that since systolic function was ''pre- served'' the problem must lie in diastole, although it is not clear by whom or when this assumption was made. Nevertheless, many guidelines followed on how to diagnose ''diastolic'' heart failure backed up by indicators of diastolic dysfunction derived from Doppler echoardiography. Diastolic heart failure is associated with a lower annual mortality rate of approximately 8% as compared to annual mortality of 19% in heart failure with systolic dysfunction, however, morbidity rate can be substantial. Thus, diastolic heart failure is an important clinical disorder mainly seen in the elderly patients with hypertensive heart disease. Early recognition and appropriate therapy of diastolic dysfunction is advisable to prevent further progression to diastolic heart failure and death. There is no specific therapy to improve LV diastolic function directly. Medical therapy of diastolic dysfunction is often empirical and lacks clear-cut pathophysiologic concepts. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and ARB as well as nitric oxide donors can be beneficial. Treatment of the underlying disease is currently the most important therapeutic approach.",

The dysfunction of serotoninergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, abnormal regulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), disturbance of cellular plasticity including reduced neurogenesis, or chronic inflammation connected with high oxidative damage play a crucial role in the development of anxiety and depression. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of atenolol alone and in combination with alprazolam/escitalopram on anxiety, depression and oxidative stress. Wistar albino rats were subjected to 21 day treatment of drugs then exposed to elevated-plus maze (EPM) and modified forced swim test (MFST), and oxidative stress markers were estimated in isolated brain tissue of all groups. The results indicated that atenolol in combination with alprazolam/escitalopram exhibited antidepressant effects by significantly decreasing the immobility and increasing the swimming behavior in the MFST and anti-anxiety effects by increasing the percentage preference and number of open arm entries as well as time spent in open arm in EPM. Pretreatment with atenolol alone and combination with alprazolam/escitalopram also ameliorated tissue glutathione (GSH) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level significantly which explore antioxidant properties of drugs, and combination augments the therapeutic response of monotherapy in depression. In conclusion behavioral and biological findings indicate that the combination of atenolol with alprazolam/escitalopram has the potential of being highly efficacious in treating anxiety and depressive disorders as well as oxidative stress.",

Urinary incontinence has been associated with worse functional status in patients with heart failure, occurring three times more frequently in patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV symptoms compared with those with milder disease. The association between heart failure and urinary symptoms may be directly attributable to worsening heart failure pathophysiology; however, medications used to treat heart failure may also indirectly provoke or exacerbate urinary symptoms. This type of drug-disease interaction, in which the treatment for heart failure precipitates incontinence, and removal of medications to relieve incontinence worsens heart failure, can be termed therapeutic competition. The mechanisms by which heart failure medication such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers aggravate lower urinary tract symptoms are discussed. Initiation of a prescribing cascade, whereby antimuscarinic agents or \u03b23-agonists are added to treat symptoms of urinary urgency and incontinence, is best avoided. Recommendations and practical tips are provided that outline more judicious management of heart failure patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Compelling strategies to improve urinary outcomes include titrating diuretics, switching ACE inhibitors, treating lower urinary tract infections, appropriate fluid management, daily weighing, and uptake of pelvic floor muscle exercises.", 
    "197": "Heart rate was proposed as an emergent cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. Previous studies have shown associations between increased heart rate and CV risk in various populations. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic relevance of heart rate in a large contemporaneous medically optimized cohort of patients with stable chronic CV disease.", 
    "198": "In a post hoc analysis of the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trials, we evaluated associations between baseline and average heart rate in trial with CV risk in 31, 531 patients followed for a median of 5 years. The primary outcome, major vascular events (MVE), was a composite of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and congestive heart failure (CHF). Pre-specified secondary outcomes included all-cause death and the individual components of the primary outcome. Associations between heart rate and outcomes were computed with heart rate as a continuous variable, baseline heart rate >70 vs \u2264 70 bpm, and across heart rate quintiles, adjusting for other markers of risk, beta-blocker and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker use. For each 10 bpm increase in baseline and average heart rate, we observed a significant increase in risk of MVE, CV death, CHF and all-cause death. There was a continuous relationship between MVE and baseline and, more importantly, average in-trial heart rate, with no observed threshold. MVE, CV death, stroke, CHF, and all-cause death increased across heart rate quintiles. There was no association between MI and HR. Results were consistent in clinically relevant subgroups. There were modest but significant improvements in C-statistic and in statistical measures of model calibration for models that included heart rate for MVE, CV death, CHF and all-cause death.", 
    "199": "This large study examined and quantitated associations between heart rate and CV events in a contemporary medically optimized population with stable CV disease. Resting and, in particular, in-trial average heart rate are independently associated with significant increases in CV events and all-cause death.", 
    "200": "Using C9 cells stably expressing LPA1 receptors fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein, it was observed that activation of protein kinase C induced a rapid and strong increase in the phosphorylation state of these receptors. Overnight incubation with phorbol esters markedly decreased the amount of conventional (\u03b1, \u03b2I, \u03b2II and \u03b3) and novel (\u03b4) but not atypical (\u03b6) immunodetected PKC isoforms, this treatment blocks the action of protein kinase on receptor function and phosphorylation. Bis-indolylmaleimide I a general, non-subtype selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and G\u00f6 6976, selective for the isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2, were also able to block LPA1 receptor desensitization and phosphorylation; hispidin, isoform \u03b2-selective blocker partially avoided receptor desensitization. Expression of dominant-negative protein kinase C \u03b1 or \u03b2 II mutants and knocking down the expression of these kinase isozymes markedly decreased phorbol ester-induced LPA1 receptor phosphorylation without avoiding receptor desensitization. This effect was blocked by bis-indolyl-maleimide and G\u00f6 6976, suggesting that these genetic interventions were not completely effective. It was also observed that protein kinase C \u03b1 and \u03b2 II isozymes co-immunoprecipitate with LPA1 receptors and that such an association was further increased by cell treatments with phorbol esters or lysophosphatidic acid. Our data suggest that conventional protein kinase C \u03b1 and \u03b2 isozymes modulate LPA1 receptor phosphorylation state. Receptor desensitization appears to be a more complex process that might involve additional elements.",

    "205": "During in-tube solid phase microextraction, sample mixing with mobile phase contained in the autosampler tubing during extraction may result in some amount of sample becoming entrained in the mobile phase rather than returning to the sample vial or being directed to waste after extraction. In cases where target analytes have relatively low affinity for the sorbent on the wall of the capillary, mixing can impact data quality. Where the sample contains components that may interfere with either the separation (e.g. proteins) or detection (e.g. ions with MS detection), additional difficulties can arise. In the current research, the magnitude of the sample mixing effect was illustrated by analyzing ranitidine and a series of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The sample volume equivalent of mixing was calculated as 37 \u03bcL for ranitidine and 20 \u03bcL for PAHs using the same inner diameter of capillary. To address this issue, a novel approach involving adding a switching valve located between the metering pump and the capillary was developed. Capillary flush conditions, draw/eject speed and extraction time were optimized for ranitidine with the result that in the final method, no mixing of sample with mobile phase was apparent in the detected amounts. To provide information on a compound class with intermediate polarity, two -blockers were also extracted using the optimized washing conditions respectively. The results indicated that the issue of sample mixing had been resolved for these as well. Finally, in-tube SPME calibration of these three analyte classes was shown to be highly linear, providing further indication that sample mixing was not impacting data quality. Available literature on the subject was surveyed, and a discussion on the rational selection of conditions to guide method development was also provided.",

A total of 329 patients (92%) alive at 18 months agreed to long-term follow-up. HF medication was intensified to a larger extent in the NT-proBNP-guided group. During long-term, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve hospital-free (primary end point: hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-1.06; P=0.16) or overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.13; P=0.25) but did improve HF hospitalization-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.90; P=0.005). Patients aged 60 to 74 years had benefit from NT-proBNP-guided therapy on the primary end point and HF hospitalization-free survival, whereas patients aged\u226575 years did not (P<0.10 for interaction). In landmark analysis, there was no regression to the mean after cessation of the NT-proBNP-guided strategy. More intensified HF medication at month 12 was associated with better long-term HF hospitalization-free and overall survival.",

Within the subgroup of patients aged 60 to 74 years, it improved clinical outcome including the primary end point. These effects did not disappear after cessation of the NT-proBNP-guided strategy on the long-term. This is possibly attributable to a more intensified HF medical therapy in the NT-proBNP-guided group.",

Drug costs and diagnosis costs, computer tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), and coronary angiography (CAG), are adopted to the model. Landiolol is administered only to slow the heart rate to take CT images appropriately. Since some trials proved that there was no difference between landiolol and placebo in terms of efficacy and safety, this study conducted cost-minimization analysis. Of those suspected of coronary heart diseases, 22.5% are thought to be taking beta-blockers. The success rates for CT scanning for landiolol and placebo, derived from domestic trial data, were 81.4% (96/118, 77.8-84.9%) and 54.2% (64/118, 49.7-58.8%).
