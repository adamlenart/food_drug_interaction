The goal of our study was to compare the association of routinely prescribed antihypertensive regimens with outcomes in US hemodialysis patients.We used 2 datasets for our analysis. Our primary cohort (US Renal Data System [USRDS]) included adult patients initiating in-center hemodialysis from July 1, 2006 to June 30, 2008 (n\u200a=\u200a33,005) with follow-up through December 31, 2009. Our secondary cohort included adult patients from Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI), a national not-for-profit dialysis provider, initiating in-center hemodialysis from January 1, 2003 to June 30, 2008 (n\u200a=\u200a11,291) with follow-up through December 31, 2008. We linked the USRDS cohort with Medicare part D prescriptions-fill data and the DCI cohort with USRDS data. Unique aspect of USRDS cohort was pharmacy prescription-fill data and for DCI cohort was detailed clinical data, including blood pressure, weight, and ultrafiltration. We classified prescribed antihypertensives into the following mutually exclusive regimens: \u03b2-blockers, renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs-containing regimens without a \u03b2-blocker (RAS), \u03b2-blocker\u200a+\u200aRAS, and others. We used marginal structural models accounting for time-updated comorbidities to quantify each regimen's association with mortality (both cohorts) and cardiovascular hospitalization (DCI-Medicare Subcohort).In the USRDS and DCI cohorts there were 9655 (29%) and 3200 (28%) deaths, respectively. In both cohorts, RAS compared to \u03b2-blockers regimens were associated with lower risk of death; (hazard ratio [HR]) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for all-cause mortality, (0.90 [0.82-0.97] in USRDS and 0.87 [0.76-0.98] in DCI) and cardiovascular mortality (0.84 [0.75-0.95] in USRDS and 0.88 [0.71-1.07] in DCI). There was no association between antihypertensive regimens and the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations.In hemodialysis patients undergoing routine care, renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs-containing regimens were associated with a lower risk of death compared with \u03b2-blockers-containing regimens but there was no association with cardiovascular hospitalizations. Pragmatic clinical trials are needed to specifically examine the effectiveness of these commonly used antihypertensive regimens in dialysis patients.", 
    "1": "Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is one manifestation of atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD have an increased rate of mortality due to concurrent coronary artery disease and hypertension. Betablockers (BB) may, therefore, be prescribed, especially in case of heart failure. However, BB safety in PAD is controversial, because of presumed peripheral hemodynamic consequences of BB that could lead to worsening of symptoms in patients with PAD. In this context, we aimed to determine the impact of BB on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and amputation rate at 1 year after hospitalization for PAD from the COPART Registry population. This is a prospective multicenter observational study collecting data from consecutive patients hospitalized for PAD in vascular medicine departments of 4 academic hospitals in France. Patients with, either claudication, critical limb ischemia or acute lower limb ischemia related to a documented PAD were included. We compared the outcomes of patients with BB versus those without BB in their prescription list at hospital discharge. The mean age of the study population was 70.9 years, predominantly composed of males (71%). Among the 1267 patients at admission, 28% were treated by BB for hypertension, prior myocardial infarction or heart failure. During their hospital stay, 40% underwent revascularization (including bypass surgery 29% and angioplasty 74%), 17% required an amputation, and 5% died. In a multivariate analysis, only prior myocardial infarction was found associated with BB prescription with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.11, P\u200a<\u200a0.001. Conversely, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or PAD with ulcer impeded BB prescription (OR: 0.57 and 0.64, P\u200a=\u200a0.007; P\u200a=\u200a0.001, respectively). One-year overall mortality of patients with BB did not differ from those without (23% vs. 23%, P\u200a=\u200a0.95). The 1-year amputation rate did not differ either (4% vs. 6%, P\u200a=\u200a0.14). Patients hospitalized for PAD with a BB in their prescription did not worsen their outcome at 1 year compared to patients without BB. Based on these safety data, prospective study could be conducted to assess the effect of BB on long-term mortality and amputation rate in patients with mild, moderate, and severe PAD.", 
    "2": "A relapse into nicotine addiction during abstinence often occurs after the reactivation of nicotine reward memories, either by acute exposure to nicotine (a smoking episode) or by smoking-associated conditioned stimuli (CS). Preclinical studies suggest that drug reward memories can undergo memory reconsolidation after being reactivated, during which they can be weakened or erased by pharmacological or behavioral manipulations. However, translational clinical studies using CS-induced memory retrieval-reconsolidation procedures to decrease drug craving reported inconsistent results.",

    "9": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is increasingly identified as modulator of fibrosis. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, has been widely used as the first choice of treatment in chronic renal diseases. We postulated that anti-fibrotic effect of losartan is mediated through inhibition of ER stress via SIRT1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1) hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1)/thioredoxin pathway. Renal tubular cells, tunicamycin (TM)-induced ER stress, and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model were used. Expression of ER stress was assessed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical stain. ER stress was induced by chemical ER stress inducer, tunicamycin, and non-chemical inducers such as TGF-\u03b2, angiotensin II, high glucose, and albumin. Losartan suppressed the TM-induced ER stress, as shown by inhibition of TM-induced expression of GRP78 (glucose related protein 78) and p-eIF2\u03b1 (phosphospecific-eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2\u03b1), through up-regulation of SIRT1 via HO-1 and thioredoxin. Losartan also suppressed the ER stress by non-chemical inducers. In both animal models, losartan reduced the tubular expression of GRP78, which were abolished by pretreatment with sirtinol (SIRT1 inhibitor). Sirtinol also blocked the inhibitory effect of losartan on the UUO-induced renal fibrosis. These findings provide new insights into renoprotective effects of losartan and suggest that SIRT1, HO-1, and thioredoxin may be potential pharmacological targets in kidney diseases under excessive ER stress condition.", 
    "10": "Coronary artery microfistulas are a rare anomaly; their association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is even rarer and can lead to serious cardiac complications owing to coronary steal phenomena such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden death.", 
    "11": "A 32-year-old Indian woman presented to our institute with severe angina on exertion and multiple episodes of pre-syncope. Echocardiography revealed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography showed no significant atherosclerotic lesions; however, it revealed multiple microfistulas originated from all three major coronary arteries and draining into her right ventricle. This finding was confirmed by the rapid filling of the pulmonary artery after dye was injected into her left coronary artery during a cardiac catheterization study and by a significant oxygen step up of 15\u00a0% seen from her right atria to right ventricle during oximetry analysis. We treated our patient's condition with medical therapy including metoprolol and nicorandil. She improved and angina grade had decreased from class III to class II on a follow-up visit 1\u00a0month after discharge.",

    "13": "The spectrum of sepsis and septic shock remains a highly prevalent disease state, carrying a high risk of morbidity and mortality. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays an important role in this initial cascade, enabling the host to respond to invading pathogens; however, prolonged activation can become pathological. The potential for unregulated sympathetic tone to become of detriment in patients with sepsis has fueled interest in the role and impact of sympatholysis, the selective inhibition of sympathetic tone. The cornerstone of septic shock therapy for decades has been the supplementation of catecholamines and thus potential further perpetuation of this sympathetic dysregulation. Although the theory of sympatholysis circulates around cardiovascular effects and stroke volume optimization, the impact of augmenting the SNS may extend well beyond this, including the impacts on the immune system, inflammatory cascade, and even gene transcription. Presently, the most robust clinical evidence involves the use of the cardioselective \u03b2-blocker esmolol in patients with septic shock with persistent tachycardia secondary to catecholamine use. Evidence is isolated only to animal models with \u03b1-agonists. Future evidence stands to elucidate the balance of sympathetic and autonomic tone as well as the potential role of redirecting and maximizing sympathetic activity.",

    "18": "Alcohol abuse disorders are associated with dysfunction of frontal cortical areas including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC is extensively innervated by monoamines, and drugs that target monoamine receptors have been used to treat a number of neuropsychiatric diseases, including alcoholism. However, little is known regarding how monoamines affect OFC neuron excitability or whether this modulation is altered by chronic exposure to ethanol. In this study, we examined the effect of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin on lOFC neuronal excitability in naive mice and in those exposed to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment. All three monoamines decreased current-evoked spike firing of lOFC neurons and this action required Gi\u03b1-coupled D2, \u03b12-adrenergic, and 5HT1A receptors, respectively. Inhibition of firing by dopamine or the D2 agonist quinpirole, but not norepinephrine or serotonin, was prevented by the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin. GABA-mediated tonic current was enhanced by dopamine or the D1 agonist SKF81297 but not quinpirole, whereas the amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs was increased by quinpirole but not dopamine. Spiking was also inhibited by the direct GIRK channel activator ML297, whereas blocking these channels with barium increased firing and eliminated the inhibitory actions of monoamines. In the presence of ML297 or the G-protein blocker GDP-\u03b2-S, DA induced a further decrease in spike firing, suggesting the involvement of a non-GIRK channel mechanism. In neurons from CIE-treated mice, spike frequency was nearly doubled and inhibition of firing by monoamines or ML297 was lost. These effects occurred in the absence of significant changes in expression of Gi/o or GIRK channel proteins. Together, these findings show that monoamines are important modulators of lOFC excitability and suggest that disruption of this process could contribute to various deficits associated with alcohol dependence.",

    "31": "Non-cardiac critically ill patients with type II myocardial infarction (MI) have a high risk of mortality. There are no evidence-based interventions to mitigate this risk. We systematically reviewed the literature regarding the use of medications known to reduce mortality in patients with cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation due to type I MI (\u03b2 blockers, statin, and aspirin) in studies of critically ill patients without Type I MI. All PubMed publications between 1976-2/19/16 were reviewed. Search terms included: \u03b2 blocker or aspirin or statin and intensive care unit (ICU) or critically ill or sepsis; 497 primary references were obtained. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) study population consisted of critically ill patients in the ICU with non-cardiovascular illnesses, (2) mortality end point, (3) severity of illness (or injury) was measured, and (4) the antiplatelet agent was primarily aspirin. Retrospective investigations, prospective observational studies, meta-analysis, systematic review, and randomized controlled trials were included; case reports were excluded. 25 primary references were obtained. The data were extracted and tabulated using data collection headings as follows: article title, first author/year/reference number, study type/design, population studied, outcome and intervention, and study question addressed. Evidence was not graded as the majority of studies were non-randomized (low-to-moderate quality). 11 studies were found through bibliography reviews for a total of 36 references. In conclusion, \u03b2 blockers, statins, and aspirin may play a role in reducing mortality in non-cardiac critically ill patients. Benefit appears to be related to severity of illness, for which cTn may be a marker.",

Diagnosis is often delayed or misdiagnosed due to its rarity in the western world and subtle features of hyperthyroidism on initial presentation. Here we present the case of a 25-year-old man who presented to the emergency department (ED) with sudden onset weakness of bilateral upper and lower extremities. His labs revealed hypokalaemia with elevated T4 and suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone and he was diagnosed with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. He was treated with potassium repletion, atenolol and methimazole with complete reversal of his paralysis within the next day. Unfortunately, he failed to keep the follow-up appointment after discharge, ran out of his methimazole and landed up in the ED again.",

Here, we report the discovery of a small-molecule negative allosteric modulator (antagonist), compound 15 [([4-((2S)-3-(((S)-3-(3-bromophenyl)-1-(methylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)amino)-2-(2-cyclohexyl-2-phenylacetamido)-3-oxopropyl)benzamide], exhibiting a unique chemotype and low micromolar affinity for the \u03b22AR. Binding of 15 to the receptor cooperatively enhances orthosteric inverse agonist binding while negatively modulating binding of orthosteric agonists. Studies with a specific antibody that binds to an intracellular region of the \u03b22AR suggest that 15 binds in proximity to the G-protein binding site on the cytosolic surface of the \u03b22AR. In cell-signaling studies, 15 inhibits cAMP production through the \u03b22AR, but not that mediated by other Gs-coupled receptors. Compound 15 also similarly inhibits \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the activated \u03b22AR. This study presents an allosteric small-molecule ligand for the \u03b22AR and introduces a broadly applicable method for screening DNA-encoded small-molecule libraries against purified GPCR targets. Importantly, such an approach could facilitate the discovery of GPCR drugs with tailored allosteric effects.", 
    "38": "Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) remains a challenge, and there are currently no specific or uniformly effective therapies. Although widespread or rapidly progressive disease often requires systemic treatment, localised and mild lesions may be effectively controlled with topical agents. The most frequently applied topical drugs are corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Recently, a patient with idiopathic PG of the lower limb was successfully treated with topical timolol and collagenase. Here, we report a case of a patient with collagenous colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and periumbilical PG. Persistent ulcerated skin lesions were successfully treated with topical timolol, although a flare of the underlying bowel disease temporarily interrupted the improvement. The case presented enhances the previously reported therapeutic potential of topical timolol in the treatment of PG. Control of chronic underlying disorders is critical to prevent rebound flares and maintain the benefit.", 
    "39": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which comprises approximately 50% of all heart failure patients, is a challenging and complex clinical syndrome that is often thought to lack effective treatments. Areas covered: Despite the common mantra that HFpEF has no effective treatments, closer inspection of HFpEF clinical trials reveals that several of the drugs tested are associated with benefits in exercise capacity and quality of life, and reduction in heart failure hospitalization. Here we review major randomized controlled trials in HFpEF, focusing on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists, organic nitrates, digoxin, beta-blockers, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. In addition, we review several classes of drugs currently in development for HFpEF such as neprilysin inhibitors, inorganic nitrates (nitrites), and soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators. Expert opinion: HFpEF should not be viewed as lacking effective treatments. While there have been no breakthrough clinical trials showing a reduction in mortality, several existing medications are likely to benefit specific subgroups of HFpEF patients. HFpEF is now well known to be a heterogeneous syndrome; thus, the clinical management of HFpEF patients and future HFpEF clinical trials will both likely require a nuanced, phenotype-specific approach instead of a one-size-fits-all tactic. Drug development for HFpEF therefore represents an exciting opportunity for personalized medicine.",

An almost 2-fold greater response to G15 than to supramaximal tolbutamide in G3 or to KCl+diazoxide in G15 vs G3 quantified the contribution of metabolic amplification to insulin secretion. Both disruption (latrunculin-B) and stabilization (jasplakinolide) of microfilaments augmented insulin secretion without affecting metabolic amplification.

Sulphonylurea effects were thus clearly glucose-dependent. Insulin secretion was also increased by inhibiting K channels other than KATP channels: Kv or BK channels (tetraethylammonium), TASK-1 channels (ML-365) and SK4 channels (TRAM-34). Opening KATP channels with diazoxide inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion with half maximum inhibitory concentrations of 9.6 and 24\u2009\u00b5mol/L at G7 and G15. Blockade of L-type Ca channels (nimodipine) abolished insulin secretion, whereas a blocker of T-type Ca channels (NNC-55-0396) was ineffective at specific concentrations.

Methods UCMSCs and BMECs were co-cultured by double-chamber Transwell(TM), and other BMECs were cultured alone as a control group. Insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitor AG1024 was used to treat cells. IGF-1, \u03b2 casein (CSN2) and \u03ba casein (CSN3) content in the supernatants were determined by ELISA; the relative expression abundance of Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway-related genes were detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR); and after the cells were treated with JAK2 signal blocker AG490, qRT-PCR was performed to test the relative expression abundance of CSN2 and CSN3 mRNAs. Results CSN2, CSN3 synthetic quantity, and the relative expression abundance of CSN2, CSN3, JAK2, STAT5, E74-like ETS transcription factor 5 (ELF5) mRNAs of the co-culture group were significantly higher than those of the control group. After treated with AG1024, the co-culture group showed remarkably decreased CSN2, CSN3 synthesis in BMECs as well as the decreased relative expression abundance of CSN2, CSN3, JAK2, STAT5, ELF5 mRNAs. After blocked with AG490, the relative expression abundance of CSN2 and CSN3 mRNAs were reduced significantly in the co-culture group. In addition, the expressions of CSN2 and CSN3 mRNAs were inhibited significantly when both AG1024 and AG490 were supplemented. Conclusion UCMSCs can mediate JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway via IGF-1, and increase the expressions of milk protein synthesis key genes in BMECs, thus promoteing the synthesis of milk protein.",

We found no outcome trials involving the newer vasodilating beta-blockers (e.g. nebivolol).There was no difference in all-cause mortality between beta-blockers and placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.11), diuretics or RAS inhibitors, but it was higher for beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14). The evidence on mortality was of moderate-certainty for all comparisons.Total CVD was lower for beta-blockers compared to placebo (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97; low-certainty evidence), a reflection of the decrease in stroke (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.96; low-certainty evidence) since there was no difference in coronary heart disease (CHD: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The effect of beta-blockers on CVD was worse than that of CCBs (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.29; moderate-certainty evidence), but was not different from that of diuretics (moderate-certainty) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty). In addition, there was an increase in stroke in beta-blockers compared to CCBs (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.40; moderate-certainty evidence) and RAS inhibitors (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.53; moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was little or no difference in CHD between beta-blockers and diuretics (low-certainty evidence), CCBs (moderate-certainty evidence) or RAS inhibitors (low-certainty evidence). In the single trial involving participants aged 65 years and older, atenolol was associated with an increased CHD incidence compared to diuretics (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.32). Participants taking beta-blockers were more likely to discontinue treatment due to adverse events than participants taking RAS inhibitors (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.54; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little or no difference with placebo, diuretics or CCBs (low-certainty evidence).", 
    "88": "Most outcome RCTs on beta-blockers as initial therapy for hypertension have high risk of bias. Atenolol was the beta-blocker most used. Current evidence suggests that initiating treatment of hypertension with beta-blockers leads to modest CVD reductions and little or no effects on mortality. These beta-blocker effects are inferior to those of other antihypertensive drugs. Further research should be of high quality and should explore whether there are differences between different subtypes of beta-blockers or whether beta-blockers have differential effects on younger and older people.", 
    "89": "Inhibition of the potassium channels TREK-1 by spadin (SPA) is currently thought to be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of depression. Since these channels are expressed in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, we investigated their role in the control of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we confirmed the expression of TREK-1 channels in the insulin secreting MIN6-B1 \u03b2-cell line and in mouse islets. We found that their blockade by SPA potentiated insulin secretion induced by potassium chloride dependent membrane depolarization. Inhibition of TREK-1 by SPA induced a decrease of the resting membrane potential (\u0394Vm ~ 12\u2009mV) and increased the cytosolic calcium concentration. In mice, administration of SPA enhanced the plasma insulin level stimulated by glucose, confirming its secretagogue effect observed in vitro. Taken together, this work identifies SPA as a novel potential pharmacological agent able to control insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis.",

Our laboratory indicated that these effects may be attributable to changes at the level of the myofilaments. However, these signaling mechanisms remain unknown. Because a common finding in dilated cardiomyopathy is a reduction in the myofilament-Ca(2)(+) response, we hypothesized that \u03b2-arrestin signaling would increase myofilament-Ca(2)(+) responsiveness in a model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and improve cardiac function and morphology.",

At the end of the treatment protocol, we assessed cardiac function using echocardiography, the myofilament-Ca(2)(+) response of detergent-extracted fiber bundles, and used proteomic approaches to understand changes in posttranslational modifications of proteins that may explain functional changes. We also assessed signaling pathways altered in vivo and by using isolated myocytes.",

Myofilaments of TRV120067-treated Tm-E54K mice had significantly improved myofilament-Ca(2)(+) responsiveness, which was depressed in untreated Tm-E54K mice. We attributed these changes to increased MLC2v and MYPT1/2 phosphorylation seen only in TRV120067-treated mice. We found that the functional changes were attributable to an activation of ERK1/2-RSK3 signaling, mediated through \u03b2-arrestin, which may have a novel role in increasing MLC2v phosphorylation through a previously unrecognized interaction of \u03b2-arrestin localized to the sarcomere.", 
    "93": "Long-term \u03b2-arrestin 2-biased agonism of the angiotensin II receptor may be a viable approach to the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy by not only preventing maladaptive signaling, but also improving cardiac function by altering the myofilament-Ca(2)(+) response via \u03b2-arrestin signaling pathways.",

Here, we present the case of a 33-year-old female patient with extensive metastatic ER+/PR+/HER2- mucinous adenocarcinoma of the breast, who was started on doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide therapy after progressing on paclitaxel and ovarian suppressor goserelin with aromatase inhibitor exemestane. The patient was comanaged by cardiology, who carefully monitored measures of cardiac function, including EKGs, serial echocardiograms, and profiling of lipids, troponin, and pro-BNP every 2 months. The patient was treated with the cardioprotective agent dexrazoxane, and changes in cardiac markers [e.g. decreases in ejection fraction (EF)] were immediately addressed by therapeutic intervention with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril and beta-blocker metoprolol. The patient had a complete response to doxorubicin therapy, with a cumulative dose of 1,350 mg/m(2), which is significantly above the recommended limits, and to our knowledge, the highest dose reported in literature. Two and a half years after the last doxorubicin cycle, the patient is asymptomatic with no cardiotoxicity and an excellent quality of life. This case highlights the importance of careful monitoring and management of doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity, and that higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines can be considered in patients with ongoing clinical benefit.",

We hypothesized that nebivolol, a \u03b2-blocker with nitric oxide activity, would be superior to a pure \u03b2-blocker in preventing tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in a porcine model. Fifteen healthy Yucatan pigs were randomly assigned to receive nebivolol, metoprolol, or placebo once a day. All pigs underwent dual-chamber pacemaker implantation. The medication was started the day after the pacemaker implantation. On day 7 after implantation, each pacemaker was set at atrioventricular pace (rate, 170 beats/min), and the pigs were observed for another 7 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiograms, serum catecholamine levels, and blood chemistry data were obtained at baseline and at the end of the study. At the end of week 8, the pigs were euthanized, and complete histopathologic studies were performed. All the pigs developed left ventricular cardiomyopathy but remained hemodynamically stable and survived to the end of the study. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from baseline by 34%, 20%, and 20% in the nebivolol, metoprolol, and placebo groups, respectively. These changes did not differ significantly among the 3 groups (P =0.51). Histopathologic analysis revealed mild left ventricular perivascular fibrosis with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in 14 of the 15 pigs. Both nebivolol and metoprolol failed to prevent cardiomyopathy in our animal model of persistent tachycardia and a high catecholamine state.",

Those in the esmolol treatment group were given esmolol in addition to the conventional treatment. The heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and respiratory rate (RR) were continuously monitored for all children. Blood samples were collected from all children before treatment and 1, 3, and 5 days after treatment to measure the levels of norepinephrine (NE), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) p65 in mononuclear cells.

We assessed whether guiding therapy with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) monitoring may improve survival by preventing VRB. Patients with cirrhosis with controlled variceal bleeding were randomized to an HVPG-guided therapy group (N\u2009=\u200984) or to a control group (N\u2009=\u200986). In both groups, HVPG and acute \u03b2-blocker response were evaluated at baseline and HVPG measurements were repeated at 2-4 weeks to determine chronic response. In the HVPG-guided group, acute responders were treated with nadolol and acute nonresponders with nadolol+nitrates. Chronic nonresponders received nadolol+prazosin and had a third HVPG study. Ligation sessions were repeated until response was achieved. The control group was treated with nadolol+nitrates+ligation. Between-group baseline characteristics were similar. During long-term follow-up (median of 24 months), mortality was lower in the HVPG-guided therapy group than in the control group (29% vs. 43%; hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.59; 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20090.35-0.99).

    "106": "Cirrhosis is the end-stage of chronic liver disease and leads to the development of portal hypertension and its complications such as esophagogastric varices. Non-selective beta blockers (NSBB) are the keystone for the treatment of portal hypertension since the 1980s and, over the decades, several studies have confirmed their beneficial effect on the prevention of variceal (re)bleeding. Pharmacological studies showed effects of gender, sex hormones, oral contraceptives, and pregnancy on cytochrome P450 (CYPs) enzymes that metabolise NSBB, suggesting that gender differences might exist in the effect of NSBB. In this review, we focused on the 35-year knowledge about the use of beta blockers in cirrhosis and potential gender differences. We specifically examined the role of NSBB in pre-primary, primary and secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, compared two commonly used NSBB (i.e., Propranolol and Carvedilol), and present the current controversies about the window of treatment in advanced cirrhosis with a specific focus on gender differences in NSBB effects. NSBB are not currently recommended in pre-primary prophylaxis of varices mainly because of lack of proven efficacy. On the other hand, NSBB are strongly recommended in patient with cirrhosis as primary (as alternative to endoscopic band ligation, EBL) and secondary prophylaxis (in addition to EBL) of variceal bleeding. To date, no studies have focused specifically on the effect of gender on NSBB treatment. Data extrapolated from clinical studies show that gender was neither a risk factor for the development of varices nor associated with a different response to treatment in primary or secondary prophylaxis. According to the available guidelines, no different, gender-based treatment for portal hypertension is recommended.",

This anemia is associated with suppression of bone marrow (BM) erythroid colony growth, along with decreased iron levels, and elevated erythropoietin (EPO) levels, which are insufficient to promote effective erythropoiesis. The impact of norepinephrine on iron regulators, such as ferroportin, transferrin, and transferrin receptor-1 (TFR-1), is unknown. Using a clinically relevant rodent model of lung contusion (LC), hemorrhagic shock (HS), and chronic stress (CS), we hypothesize that daily propranolol (BB), a nonselective \u03b2 blocker, restores BM function and improves iron homeostasis.",

Daily BB use after LCHS/CS improved BM cellularity, colony-forming units granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte megakaryocyte, burst-forming unit erythroid and colony-forming unit erythroid cell colony growth. LCHS/CS + BB significantly reduced plasma EPO levels and increased plasma hepcidin levels on day 7. The addition of CS to LCHS resulted in decreased liver ferroportin expression as well as decreased BM transferrin and TFR-1 expression, thus, blocking iron supply to erythroid cells. However, daily BB after LCHS/CS improved expression of all iron regulators.",

The values of k biol for fluoxetine, mefenamic acid, and metoprolol determined with the three consortiums indicated that ammonium-nitrite-oxidizing and heterotrophic biomass allow a partial biodegradation of the compounds, while no substantial biodegradation can be expected using nitrite-oxidizing consortium. Metoprolol was the less biodegradable compound. The sorption of fluoxetine and mefenamic acid onto biomass had a significant contribution for their removal (6-14%). The lowest sorption coefficients were obtained for metoprolol indicating that the sorption onto biomass is poor (3-4%), and the contribution of this process to the global removal can be neglected.",

For the landiolol concentrate formulation and esmolol, maximum blood concentrations were rapidly reached (mean t max ranged between 1.8 and 3.0\u00a0min for landiolol and 1.8 to 2.4\u00a0min for esmolol). The parent drugs disappeared very fast from the blood stream, with a t 1/2 of 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 (SD) minutes and 3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 (SD) minutes for the low doses of landiolol and esmolol, respectively. Despite comparable injection rates (0.1 or 0.5\u00a0mg/kg/15\u00a0s for landiolol and esmolol, respectively), the onset of significant heart rate reduction occurred earlier in response to landiolol (1\u00a0min) than in response to esmolol (2\u00a0min). In addition, significantly lower heart rate values were obtained at every dose level of landiolol, in comparison to esmolol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both compounds reduced the systolic blood pressure to a comparable degree. Especially at the highest dose, the duration of blood pressure reduction was longer under esmolol compared to landiolol. Seven mild to moderate adverse events occurred after administration of landiolol, and five occurred after administration of esmolol. No serious adverse events were reported in this study.",

Both agents reduced systolic blood pressure to a comparable degree, but the blood pressure decrease lasted longer after esmolol infusion. The local tolerance and safety profiles of the two formulations were similar. In summary, compared to esmolol, landiolol shows a more prominent and pronounced bradycardic effect in relation to its blood pressure-lowering effect, an action profile that might be of specific advantage in the perioperative setting.",

Treatment of HCM patients is empirical and current pharmacological treatments are unable to stop disease progression or reverse hypertrophy. In this study, we tested if the non-dihydropyridine Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem, which previously showed potential to stop disease progression, can improve the phenotype of a HCM mouse model (Mybpc3-targeted knock-in), which is based on a mutation commonly found in patients. Diltiazem improved contractile function of isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes acutely, but chronic application did not improve the phenotype of adult mice with a fully developed HCM. Our study shows that diltiazem has beneficial effects in HCM, but long-term treatment success is likely to depend on characteristics and cause of HCM and onset of treatment.",

Guidelines recommend \u03b2-adrenoceptor or Ca(2+) channel antagonists as pharmacological treatment. The Ca(2+) channel blocker diltiazem recently showed promising beneficial effects in pre-clinical HCM, particularly in patients carrying MYBPC3 mutations. In the present study we evaluated whether diltiazem could ameliorate or reverse the disease phenotype in cells and in vivo in an Mybpc3-targeted knock-in (KI) mouse model of HCM. Sarcomere shortening and Ca(2+) transients were measured in KI and wild-type (WT) cardiomyocytes in basal conditions (1-Hz pacing) and under stress conditions (30\u00a0nm isoprenaline, 5-Hz pacing) with or without pre-treatment with 1\u00a0\u03bcm diltiazem. KI cardiomyocytes exhibited lower diastolic sarcomere length (dSL) at baseline, a tendency to a stronger positive inotropic response to isoprenaline than WT, a marked reduction of dSL and a tendency towards arrhythmias under stress conditions. Pre-treatment of cardiomyocytes with 1\u00a0\u03bcm diltiazem reduced the drop in dSL and arrhythmia frequency in KI, and attenuated the positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline. Furthermore, diltiazem reduced the contraction amplitude at 5\u00a0Hz but did not affect diastolic Ca(2+) load and Ca(2+) transient amplitude. Six\u00a0months of diltiazem treatment of KI mice did not reverse cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction, activation of the fetal gene program or fibrosis. In conclusion, diltiazem blunted the response to isoprenaline in WT and KI cardiomyocytes and improved diastolic relaxation under stress conditions in KI cardiomyocytes. This beneficial effect of diltiazem in cells did not translate in therapeutic efficacy when applied chronically in KI mice.",

A variety of treatments are now available, but reaching a diagnosis before cardiac arrest remains a challenge. Most cases are related to variants in the gene encoding for ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2), which mediates calcium-induced calcium release. Up to half of cases remain genetically elusive. The condition is presently incurable, but one basic intervention, the universal administration of \u03b2-blockers, has improved survival. In the past, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) were frequently implanted, especially in those with a history of cardiac arrest. Treatment limitations include under-dosing and poor compliance with \u03b2-blockers, and potentially lethal ICD-related electrical storm. Newer therapies include flecainide and sympathetic ganglionectomy. Limited data have suggested that genotype may predict phenotype in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, including a higher risk of life-threatening cardiac events in subjects with variants in the C-terminus of ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2).

Kawasaki disease is the leading cause for acquired coronary artery abnormalities, which can cause late coronary artery sequelae including aneurysms, stenosis, and thrombosis, leading to myocardial ischaemia and ventricular fibrillation. Patients with anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery can develop adequate collateral circulation from the right coronary artery in the newborn period, which remains asymptomatic only to manifest in adulthood with myocardial ischaemia, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death. Anomalous origin of coronary artery from the opposite sinus occurs in 0.7% of the young general population aged between 11 and 15 years. If the anomalous coronary artery courses between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, sudden cardiac death may occur during or shortly after vigorous exercise, especially in patients where the anomalous left coronary artery originates from the right sinus of Valsalva. Symptomatic patients with evidence of ischaemia should have surgical correction. No treatment is needed for asymptomatic patients with an anomalous right coronary artery from the left sinus of Valsalva. At present, there is no consensus regarding how to manage asymptomatic patients with anomalous left coronary artery from the right sinus of Valsalva and interarterial course.

Methods A single-center retrospective study was conducted on 157 patients who underwent first-time isolated aortic valve replacement between April 1999 and February 2015. Fifty-eight patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation within 6 months postoperatively, and they were compared with patients who remained in sinus rhythm. Multivariate analyses, which incorporated the propensity score patient matching technique, were conducted to evaluate the long-term outcome of new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation and identify patients at risk of developing this arrhythmia. Results At a mean follow-up of 52.4 months (range 8.4-200.7 months), mortality was significantly higher in patients who developed atrial fibrillation compared to those who remained in sinus rhythm (2.8%/patient-year vs. 0.2%/patient-year, respectively; p\u2009<\u20090.05). Patients developing atrial fibrillation were also at an independently increased risk of stroke and readmission during follow-up. Risk analysis revealed that advanced age (>70 years) and absence of a postoperative \u03b2-blocker were predictors of atrial fibrillation. Conclusions New-onset atrial fibrillation after first-time isolated aortic valve replacement correlated significantly with late morbidity and mortality.

    "191": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ disease of unknown etiology in which the normal immune responses are directed against the body's own healthy tissues. Patients with SLE often suffer from chronic pain. Currently, no animal studies have been reported about the mechanisms underlying pain in SLE. In this study, the development of chronic pain in MRL lupus-prone (MRL/lpr) mice, a well-established lupus mouse model, was characterized for the first time. We found that female MRL/lpr mice developed thermal hyperalgesia at the age of 13\u00a0weeks, and mechanical allodynia at the age of 16\u00a0weeks. MRL/lpr mice with chronic pain had activation of microglia and astrocytes, over-expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), as well as suppression of glial glutamate transport function in the spinal cord. Intrathecal injection of either the CSF-1 blocker or IL-1 inhibitor attenuated thermal hyperalgesia in MRL/lpr mice. We provide evidence that the suppressed activity of glial glutamate transporters in the spinal dorsal horn in MRL/lpr mice is caused by activation of the CSF-1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that targeting the CSF-1 and IL-1\u03b2 signaling pathways or the glial glutamate transporter in the spinal cord is an effective approach for the management of chronic pain caused by SLE.", 
    "192": "We tried to establish the halothane-anesthetized microminipigs as an alternative animal model for non-clinical toxicity and/or safety pharmacology studies. In order to characterize the halothane-anesthetized microminipigs, we firstly clarified the effects of halothane anesthesia on their cardiovascular system (n = 5). Then, we examined the cardiovascular effects of dl-sotalol in doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.v. on the halothane-anesthetized microminipigs (n = 6). Induction of the halothane anesthesia by itself prolonged the QT interval as well as QTcF, suggesting that the halothane anesthesia can reduce the cardiac repolarization reserve in microminipigs like in dogs. dl-Sotalol showed more potent negative chronotropic, dromotropic and hypotensive effects together with repolarization delay in microminipigs than in dogs, although each cardiovascular response to dl-sotalol was directionally similar between them, suggesting greater basal sympathetic tone and/or smaller volume of distribution of the drug in microminipigs than in dogs. Analyses of proarrhythmic surrogate markers indicate that Tpeak-Tend and short-term variability of QT interval may be more sensitive to detect the dl-sotalol-induced direct electrophysiological changes in microminipigs than in dogs, but its reverse will be true for J-Tpeakc. Thus, these results may help better understand the drug-induced cardiovascular responses in microminipigs.", 
    "193": "In the elderly, calcium-channel blockers are the first-line treatment for hypertension, and macrolides are commonly prescribed antibiotics. Here we report a 78-year-old man taking nifedipine, diltiazem and carvedilol who presented with persistent hypotension and bradycardia after clarithromycin was prescribed. He was diagnosed with drug-induced hypotension and treated with fluid resuscitation and vasoactive agents. His symptoms gradually improved. He was transferred out of the intensive care unit 3\u2005days after hospitalisation. Combining calcium-channel blockers and clarithromycin can cause vasodilatory hypotension. The concomitant use of calcium-channel blockers and macrolide antibiotics increases the levels of calcium-channel blockers in the blood as they are metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), which is inhibited by macrolide antibiotics. Moreover, the addition of another calcium-channel blocker and a \u03b2 blocker can lower cardiac output due to bradycardia and worsen hypotension. Therefore, it is important to consider drug interactions when the cause of hypotension is unknown.",

    "206": "Randomized controlled trials have concluded that the cardiovascular outcome of first-step treatment of hypertension with traditional vasoconstricting beta-blockers is inferior to treatment with other antihypertensive drug classes. Beta-blocker use is also associated with undesirable side effects. Consequently, some recent guidelines consider beta-blockers an inferior option for first-step treatment of hypertension. Despite this, beta-blockers are still widely prescribed, and likely overused, in the management of hypertension. It is the contention of this perspective that beta-blockers do have an important role in treating hypertension, but their use needs to be much better targeted, by better identification of both the right patient and the right beta-blocker. Identifying the right patient involves consideration of underlying mechanisms of hypertension. In the absence of comorbidities for which a beta-blocker is indicated, beta-blockers would not seem to be the preferred treatment for patients with either sodium/volume-mediated hypertension, for which they are usually ineffective, or for those with renin-angiotensin system-mediated hypertension, for which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers provide equal antihypertensive efficacy with evidence of better outcome and fewer adverse effects. Beta-blockers would instead appear to be best suited for patients with sympathetically driven, that is, neurogenic, hypertension, whether as a first-step drug, such as in patients with hypertension in the acute post-stroke period, in so-called \"hyperkinetic\" patients, and in patients with labile hypertension, or as an add-on drug in patients with resistant hypertension. In choosing among the beta-blockers, combined alpha/beta-blockade offers advantages over beta-blocker monotherapy and merits greater clinical and research attention. Finally, unreliable bioavailability greatly interferes with the effectiveness of lipophilic, but not nonlipophilic, beta-blockers. Clinical effectiveness could be improved with greater focus on the beta-blockers with the more favorable pharmacokinetics.",

However, there is a possibility of secondary causes of hypokalemia in such a setting. CASE REPORT Herein, we present the case of a 38-year-old woman with untreated hypertension and hyperthyroidism. She presented with muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea since one week. The initial diagnosis was TPP. However, biochemistry tests showed hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis and renal potassium wasting. Moreover, a suppressed plasma renin level and a high plasma aldosterone level were noted, which was suggestive of primary aldosteronism. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed this diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, it is imperative to consider other causes of hypokalemia (apart from TPP) in a patient with hyperthyroidism but with renal potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. This can help avoid delay in diagnosis of the underlying disease.", 
    "212": "The rodents exposed to repeated cold stress according to a specific schedule, known as specific alternation of rhythm in temperature (SART), exhibit autonomic imbalance, and is now used as an experimental model of fibromyalgia. To explore the susceptibility of SART-stressed animals to novel acute stress, we tested whether exposure of mice to SART stress for 1 week alters the extent of acute restraint stress-induced hyperthermia. Mice were subjected to 7-d SART stress sessions; i.e., the mice were alternately exposed to 24 and 4\u00b0C at 1-h intervals during the daytime (09:00-16:00) and kept at 4\u00b0C overnight (16:00-09:00). SART-stressed and unstressed mice were exposed to acute restraint stress for 20-60\u2009min, during which rectal temperature was monitored. Serum corticosterone levels were measured before and after 60-min exposure to restraint stress. SART stress itself did not alter the body temperature or serum corticosterone levels in mice. Acute restraint stress increased the body temperature and serum corticosterone levels, both responses being greater in SART-stressed mice than unstressed mice. The enhanced hyperthermic responses to acute restraint stress in SART-stressed mice were significantly attenuated by SR59230A, a \u03b23 adrenoceptor antagonist, but unaffected by diazepam, an anxiolytic, mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, or indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. These results suggest that SART stress enhances the susceptibility of mice to acute restraint stress, characterized by increased hyperthermia and corticosterone secretion, and that the increased hyperthermic responses to acute stress might involve accelerated activation of sympathetic \u03b23 adrenoceptors, known to regulate non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue.",

Using the French Registry of ST-Elevation and Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (FAST-MI) 2010 registry, we investigated whether previous manifestations of atherosclerotic disease (i.e., previous MI, or a history of any form of atherosclerotic disease) are at truly increased risk compared with those in whom AMI is the first manifestation of the disease. FAST-MI 2010 is a nationwide French registry including 3,079 patients with AMI, among whom 1,062 patients had a history of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease and 498 patients had a history of MI. Overall, patients with a history of atherosclerotic disease (or MI) were older compared with patients without known cardiovascular disease (71 \u00b1 13 vs 63 \u00b1 14\u00a0years) and had higher cardiovascular risk profiles and co-morbidities. Using fully adjusted Cox multivariate analysis, previous manifestations of atherosclerotic disease were associated with higher 3-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.31; p <0.001) as history of previous MI alone (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.73; p\u00a0= 0.048). Similar results were found in patients discharged alive. In conclusion, previous cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease represents 1/3 of patients with AMI and are strongly associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes. Intensive follow-up and therapy should be encouraged in this high-risk population.",

The aim of this study was to analyze the structural changes of serum albumin caused by alkaline ageing using absorption, spectrofluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The N-A isomerization generates significant changes in bovine (BSA) and human (HSA) serum albumin subdomains-the greatest changes were observed close to the tryptophanyl (Trp) and tyrosyl (Tyr) residue regions while a smaller change was observed in phenyloalanine (Phe) environment. Moreover, the changes in the polarity of the Trp neighborhood as well as the impact of the ageing process on \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet content, and albumin molecule rotation degree have been analyzed. Based on the spectrofluorescence study, the alterations in metoprolol binding affinity to the specific sites that increase the toxicity of the drug were investigated.",

In four separate studies we used cycle ergometry exercise and infusions of isoproterenol and epinephrine to test the heart rate (HR)-lowering effect of esmolol compared with propranolol and saline in healthy humans. In cohort 1, both esmolol (\u0394HR 57 \u00b1 6 beats/min) and propranolol (\u0394HR 56 \u00b1 7 beats/min) attenuated exercise tachycardia compared with saline (\u0394HR 88 \u00b1 17 beats/min). In cohort 2, we found that the HR response to exercise was similar at 5 min (\u0394HR 57 \u00b1 9 beats/min) and 60 min (\u0394HR 55 \u00b1 9 beats/min) after initiation of the esmolol maintenance infusion. In cohort 3, we confirmed that the HR-lowering effect of esmolol disappeared 45 min after termination of the maintenance infusion. In cohort 4, changes in femoral blood flow and hematological parameters in response to epinephrine infusion were not different between esmolol and saline infusion, indicating that our esmolol infusion paradigm does not block \u03b22-receptors. Collectively, our data indicate that infusion of ~160 mg of esmolol (range 110-200 mg in the 5 min before exercise) acutely and selectively blocks \u03b21-receptors in healthy humans.

We developed 3 Markov models (one for each glaucoma stage: early, moderate and advanced), using a hypothetical cohort of POAG patients, from the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) and a horizon of the average life expectancy of the Brazilian population. Different strategies were tested according to disease severity. For early glaucoma, we compared observation, laser and medications. For moderate glaucoma, medications, laser and surgery. For advanced glaucoma, medications and surgery. Main outcome measures were ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio), medical direct costs and QALY (quality-adjusted life year).",

Compared to observation strategy, the two alternatives have provided significant gains in quality of life. In moderate glaucoma population, medical treatment presented the highest costs among treatment strategies. Both laser and surgery were highly cost-effective in this group. For advanced glaucoma, both tested strategies were cost-effective. Starting age had a great impact on results in all studied groups. Initiating glaucoma therapy using laser or surgery were more cost-effective, the younger the patient.",

    "250": "Previous studies suggest beta-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) decrease breast cancer progression, tumor metastasis, and patient mortality; however the mechanism for this is unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal and malignant breast tissue revealed overexpression of \u03b21-AR and \u03b23-AR in breast cancer. A retrospective cross-sectional study of 404 breast cancer patients was performed to determine the effect of \u03b2-blocker usage on tumor proliferation. Our analysis revealed that non-selective \u03b2-blockers, but not selective \u03b2-blockers, reduced tumor proliferation by 66% (p < 0.0001) in early stage breast cancer compared to non-users. We tested the efficacy of propranolol on an early stage breast cancer patient, and quantified the tumor proliferative index before and after treatment, revealing a propranolol-mediated 23% reduction (p = 0.02) in Ki67 positive tumor cells over a three-week period. The anti-proliferative effects of \u03b2-blockers were measured in a panel of breast cancer lines, demonstrating that mammary epithelial cells were resistant to propranolol, and that most breast cancer cell lines displayed dose dependent viability decreases following treatment. Selective \u03b2-blockers alone or in combination were not as effective as propranolol at reducing breast cancer cell proliferation. Molecular analysis revealed that propranolol treatment of the SK-BR-3 breast cancer line, which showed high sensitivity to beta blockade, led to a reduction in Ki67 protein expression, decreased phosphorylation of the mitogenic signaling regulators p44/42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, JNK, and CREB, increased phosphorylation of the cell survival/apoptosis regulators AKT, p53, and GSK3\u03b2. In conclusion, use of non-selective \u03b2-blockers in patients with early stage breast cancer may lead to decreased tumor proliferation.", 
    "251": "Severely injured burn patients receive multiple blood transfusions for anemia of critical illness despite the adverse consequences. One limiting factor to consider alternate treatment strategies is the lack of a reliable test platform to study molecular mechanisms of impaired erythropoiesis. This study illustrates how conditions resulting in a high catecholamine microenvironment such as burns can instigate myelo-erythroid reprioritization influenced by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation leading to anemia. In a mouse model of scald burn injury, we observed, along with a threefold increase in bone marrow LSK cells (lin(neg) Sca1(+)cKit(+)), that the myeloid shift is accompanied with a significant reduction in megakaryocyte erythrocyte progenitors (MEPs). \u03b2-Blocker administration (propranolol) for 6 days after burn, not only reduced the number of LSKs and MafB(+) cells in multipotent progenitors, but also influenced myelo-erythroid bifurcation by increasing the MEPs and reducing the granulocyte monocyte progenitors in the bone marrow of burn mice. Furthermore, similar results were observed in burn patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived ex vivo culture system, demonstrating that commitment stage of erythropoiesis is impaired in burn patients and intervention with propranolol (nonselective \u03b21,2-adrenergic blocker) increases MEPs. Also, MafB(+) cells that were significantly increased following standard burn care could be mitigated when propranolol was administered to burn patients, establishing the mechanistic regulation of erythroid commitment by myeloid regulatory transcription factor MafB. Overall, results demonstrate that \u03b2-adrenergic blockers following burn injury can redirect the hematopoietic commitment toward erythroid lineage by lowering MafB expression in multipotent progenitors and be of potential therapeutic value to increase erythropoietin responsiveness in burn patients.",

The aim of the present work was to reveal the physicochemical properties of API-TNT composites, focusing on the interactions between the TNTs and the incorporated APIs. Drugs belonging to different Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) classes were loaded into TNTs: diltiazem hydrochloride (BCS I.), diclofenac sodium (BCS II.), atenolol (BCS III.) and hydrochlorothiazide (BCS IV.). Experimental results demonstrated that it is feasible for spiral cross-sectioned titanate nanotubes to carry drugs and maintain their bioactivity. The structural properties of the composites were characterized by a range of analytical techniques, including FT-IR, DSC, TG-MS, etc. The interactions between APIs and TNTs were identified as electrostatic attractions, mainly dominated by hydrogen bonds. Based on the results, it can be stated that the strength of the association depends on the hydrogen donor strength of the API. The drug release of incorporated APIs was evaluated from compressed tablets and compared to that of pure APIs. Differences noticed in the dissolution profiles due to incorporation showed a correlation with the strength of interactions between the APIs and the TNTs observed in the above analytical studies.",

Based on prior studies suggesting a link between the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) and hypoxia responses, we hypothesized that the \u03b2-AR mediates hypoxia sensing and is necessary for HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation. Beta blocker treatment of mice suppressed hypoxia induction of renal HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation, erythropoietin production, and erythropoiesis in vivo. Likewise, beta blocker treatment of primary human endothelial cells in vitro decreased hypoxia-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation and binding to target genes and the downstream hypoxia-inducible gene expression. In mechanistic studies, cAMP-activated PKA and/or GPCR kinases (GRK), which both participate in \u03b2-AR signal transduction, were investigated. Direct activation of cAMP/PKA pathways did not induce HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation, and inhibition of PKA did not blunt HIF-1\u03b1 induction by hypoxia. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of GRK, or expression of a GRK phosphorylation-deficient \u03b2-AR mutant in cells, blocked hypoxia-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative analyses revealed a hypoxia-mediated \u03b2-AR phosphorylation barcode that was different from the classical agonist phosphorylation barcode. These findings indicate that the \u03b2-AR is fundamental to the molecular and physiological responses to hypoxia.",

Silk fibroin and casein concentration were selected as the independent variables and their effect were observed on dependent variables: particle size, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency, drug release, and dissolution efficiency. The developed optimized formulation was characterized using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and Powder X-ray diffraction. Surface morphology of optimized formulation using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy revealed spherical nature of particles without any evidence of aggregation. The optimized formulation showed a 2.04-fold increase in Cmax, and 6.87-fold increase in bioavailability as compared to aqueous suspension. The formulation showed sustained release as confirmed by increases in mean residence time. The in vivo in silico simulation using physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) model and population simulation (100 subjects) revealed a reasonable degree of superimposition of simulated and observed pharmacokinetic parameters based on overall fold error (\u22642.0).
