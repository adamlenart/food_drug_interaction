By oral administration of 20 mg/kg propranolol hydrochloride together with 1.5 g/kg of ethanol, it was suggested that there might be an increase in blood 4-hydroxypropranolol concentration (BHPC) though BPC did not increase. By oral administration of propranolol 3 hours after oral administration of 1.0 g/kg ethanol, it was suggested that both BPC and BHPC might increase. It was considered that the main mechanisms of increases in BPC and BHPC by ethanol were a rise of intestinal permeability to propranolol and an inhibition of 4-hydroxypropranolol metabolism in hepatic microsomes, respectively.", 
    "1": "Patients with mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism who do not meet currently accepted guidelines for surgery may be followed medically. General medical management of these individuals should be directed toward maintaining adequate hydration, therapy of hypertension, and avoiding immobilization. Diuretics should be used only with caution. Moderate dietary calcium intake (500-800 mg/day) should be encouraged. Propranolol and cimetidine are not useful in the therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism. Oral phosphate is efficacious in lowering serum and urinary calcium. However, because of concerns related to ectopic calcification, phosphate is usually reserved for those patients who meet surgical guidelines but who are not to undergo surgery. Bisphosphonates, potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, have been shown to lower serum and urinary calcium in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. However, long-term data on their efficacy in this disorder are not yet available. The use of bisphosphonates at the present time is generally restricted to the research setting. More potent bisphosphonates as well as the design of newer agents that interfere with parathyroid hormone secretion may become very useful in future approaches to the medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism.", 
    "2": "After bilateral superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) in adult male rats, norepinephrine content of the pituitary neurointermediate lobe (NIL) decreased at 12-24 h after surgery to attain concentrations 40-60% of controls between 24 and 60 h after surgery. To assess arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion during this time, plasma and NIL-AVP levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. In sham SCGx controls, plasma AVP increased about 2-fold within 6 h after surgery and decreased thereafter, to attain presurgical values by 60 h after surgery. In SCGx rats, a significant increase in plasma AVP concentration was observed at the 6th h after surgery, as compared to presurgical concentrations, with a decrease to values significantly lower than those of presurgical controls at 16-18 h after SCGx. As compared to sham-operated rats, significantly higher plasma AVP levels 6 h after surgery and significantly lower plasma AVP levels 16-24 h after surgery were found. NIL-AVP concentration in SCGx and sham-operated ras were significantly lower than presurgical levels at 6 h after surgery. SCGx rats had significantly higher amounts of AVP in NIL at 16-24 h after surgery. The changes in plasma and NIL-AVP levels found 6 or 16 h after SCGx or sham SCGx were unaffected by a prior pinealectomy. Two injections of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin 45 and 90 min before sacrifice, alone or together with the beta-blocker propranolol, prevented the increase in plasma AVP found in SCGx rats 6 h after surgery, and the decrease in plasma AVP and the increase of NIL-AVP found 16 h after SCGx.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The effects of noradrenergic and opioid peptidergic receptor blockade, either alone or in combination, on the electrical activity of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) pulse generator were studied in ovariectomized rats fitted with chronically implanted electrode arrays in the medial basal hypothalamus. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, i.e. phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg i.v.) and propranolol (5 mg/kg i.v.), respectively, significantly increased the intervals between characteristic increases (volleys) in hypothalamic multiunit activity (MUA), which were associated with the initiation of LH pulses. In contrast to this, an opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (2 mg/kg i.v.) significantly decreased the intervals between the MUA volleys. Naloxone given after the injection of propranolol induced MUA volleys with a latency of a few minutes. However, when given after the injection of phenoxybenzamine, naloxone failed to induce such immediate MUA volleys. These changes in the intervals between the MUA volleys were faithfully reflected by the pulsatile LH secretion. These results suggest that norepinephrine facilitates LHRH pulse generator activity through both alpha- and beta-adrenergic-receptors, and that the action of opioid peptides on it requires an alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated mechanism.", 
    "4": "The arterial blood pressure (BP) components of the Valsalva maneuver (VM) were analyzed to ascertain whether they could be used as an index of adrenergic regulation of the circulation. We studied a control and three age- and sex-matched patient groups. Sympathetic adrenergic failure was graded on the basis of the degree of systolic BP (SBP) reduction during tilt: orthostatic hypotension (OH; SBP greater than 30 mmHg), borderline OH (BOH; 30 less than SBP greater than 10 mmHg), and sympathetic sudomotor failure (SSF). Controls exhibited a biphasic phase II, consisting of a modest decrement (early phase II) followed by a rise in BP (late phase II; II1) above resting values. All the patient groups including SSF exhibited a significant reduction in II1. An excessive BP fall in phase II and an absent phase IV overshoot were observed in the OH group. BOH and, to a lesser extent, SSF groups showed a significant reduction in phase IV overshoot. We conclude that BP changes during VM will detect adrenergic vasoconstrictor failure with greater sensitivity than orthostatic BP recordings.", 
    "5": "To evaluate the ex-vivo effects of labetalol, at effective vasodepressor doses, on platelet aggregation in hypertension, 30 hypertensive patients were randomized to either a labetalol or control group in a ratio of two to one. For the labetalol group, the dosage was titrated from 400 mg to 600 mg per day to achieve a fall of 10 mmHg in mean arterial pressure (MAP). No drug was used in the control group. The study lasted for 4 to 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, platelet aggregation to collagen, adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine were measured according to Born's method. In contrast to the significant reduction in MAP, platelet aggregation was not altered by labetalol compared with the control group. Our data do not support the hypothesis that labetalol, at effective vasodepressor doses, inhibits platelet aggregation in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients.", 
    "6": "The effect of enalapril and angiotensin II on junctional conductance (gj) of isolated rat heart cell pairs was investigated. It was found that enalapril (1 micrograms/ml) increases gj by 106 +/- 3.1% (SEM) (n = 20) within 4 min. The effect of enalapril on gj was not suppressed by propranolol (10(-6) M) or by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor. Angiotensin II (1 micrograms/ml) reduced gj by 55%. These observations might indicate that an intrinsic renin-angiotensin system in heart is involved in the control of gj in cardiac muscle.", 
    "7": "Methoxamine, an alpha adrenoreceptor agonist, and sleep abolished repetitive nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in a 41-year-old man without detectable underlying heart disease. Detailed pacing studies revealed that the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia was totally dependent on the basic heart rate. Sleep and the alpha adrenoreceptor agonist abolished the ventricular tachycardia by slowing the basic heart rate. Verapamil, propranolol, and disopyramide were able to decrease the upper limit of the tachycardia-initiating heart rate, but none of them were able to increase the lower limit (75/min). Failure to increase the lower limit of the tachycardia-initiating heart rate was a major reason why these conventional antiarrhythmic drugs were unable to suppress his daytime episodes of repetitive ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "8": "The newborn heart is an excellent model in which to study cardiac growth because the neonatal period is a normal situation in which the left ventricle (LV) grows rapidly and the right ventricle grows slowly. Accelerated LV growth is in response to mechanical, neural, and endocrine changes at birth. Faster growth of the LV is accounted for by greater capacity for protein synthesis, as evidenced by greater RNA content. At 18 h of life, ribosomes are formed in preference to total heart protein, but at 48 h of life, faster rates of both ribosome formation and total protein synthesis are observed. In the LV of hearts from 2-day-old pigs, these rates are insensitive to the addition of glucagon, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, or a combination of norepinephrine and propranolol. These observations could result because of maximal growth stimulation already present in the LV of the newborn heart. To restrain LV growth in the neonatal period, we treated pigs with enalapril maleate, an angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitor. Enalapril blocked growth of the LV as well as the increase in RNA content. When hearts from enalapril-treated pigs were perfused in vitro, rates of protein synthesis and ribosome formation in the LV were lower. These studies suggest that angiotensin II is an important factor accounting for rapid growth of the neonatal heart in response to pressure overload at birth.", 
    "9": "Self poisoning with beta-blocking drugs might increase with the extension of their therapeutic fields. Usually the management of this intoxication is mainly directed toward antagonizing the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking effects. Thus attention is specially directed to the cardiovascular condition and to the bronchoconstrictor effect. Nonetheless, in spite of this treatment, fatal cases have been reported, suggesting that other complications are responsible of the clinical course of this acute poisoning. In fact, in some cases, a respiratory arrest appeared as the major determinant of death, although the cardiovascular effects were correctly antagonized. Furthermore, the few studies in animals and in healthy volunteers indicated that beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the brain stem stimulate the ventilatory control system. Beta 1 lipophilic antagonists induce a central ventilatory depression and consecutively a respiratory arrest, which is not antagonized by beta mimetic drugs. Awareness of this complication may lead to a greater care in managing the poisoned patients and in starting early mechanical ventilation, which influence the outcome favourably.", 
    "10": "New duplicated analogs of the alpha 1-selective agonist methoxamine and of its cyclic derivative 5,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthylamine have been synthesized and tested for their adrenergic properties. All the compounds prepared, presenting a polymethylene spacer of varying length between two units of the active structure, turned out to be completely devoid of any alpha-stimulating activity. Surprisingly, some of them showed a marked beta-adrenergic agonistic effect, being the most interesting compound active at nanomolar concentration.", 
    "11": "A prospective study of electrocardiograms (ECG's) was carried out on 102 adult hypertensive African patients at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Their mean age was 45.2 years. All the patients had normal sinus rhythm. Forty seven percent of the patients had sinus bradycardia, although this could be attributable to the drugs they were taking. The duration of the P wave increased with the severity of hypertension. Twenty five percent of the patients had evidence of first degree A-V block. This was an expected finding as most of the patients were on treatment with B-adrenoreceptor blocking agents. Two patients had LBBB and none had RBBB. There were 13 patients with evidence of left axis deviation (LAD) and the incidence increased with the severity of hypertension. S-T, T changes were noted in 12.8% and 29% of patients respectively. Q-Tc duration did not increase with severity of hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy was noted in 27.5% of the patients using the criteria devised by Romhilt et al.", 
    "12": "Tracheal relaxing effects and beta 2-selectivity of TA-2005 were investigated by functional experiments and radioligand binding assay in guinea pigs in comparison with those of other beta-agonists, isoproterenol, procaterol, formoterol and salbutamol. The relaxing activity of TA-2005 on histamine-induced contraction in the isolated trachea was most potent among the five agonists, and it was blocked by a beta 2-selective antagonist (ICI 118,551) but not by a beta 1-selective antagonist (bisoprolol). The potency of the relaxing effect was in the order of TA-2005 (pD2 = 9.79) greater than formoterol greater than procaterol greater than isoproterenol greater than or equal to salbutamol. The positive chronotropic effect of TA-2005 was similar to that of isoproterenol; and it was more potent than those of formoterol, procaterol and salbutamol in the isolated atria. The selectivity for tracheal muscle to atria of these agonists were in the order of procaterol greater than greater than or equal to formoterol greater than TA-2005 greater than salbutamol much greater than isoproterenol. A radioligand binding experiment using guinea pig lung and cardiac ventricle as beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptor sources, respectively, has also demonstrated that TA-2005 possesses extremely high affinity (IC50 = 1.04 nM) and selectivity (38-fold) to beta 2-adrenoceptors. By addition of GTP, the competition curve of [125I]iodocyanopindolol shifted rightward, indicating the agonist property. These results confirmed that TA-2005 is a highly beta 2-selective agonist that exerts a potent tracheal relaxing effect.",

The influence of instrumental parameters on the fragmentation pattern of labetalol, acebutolol, diacetolol, sotalol and atenolol is described. A short biomedical application is presented.", 
    "14": "A retrospective review was made of the early management of 50 consecutive patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction to assess the potential suitability and actual application of thrombolysis, intravenous beta-blockade and aspirin therapy. Thrombolysis was indicated for 15 patients (30%), of whom 14 actually did receive intravenous streptokinase. Thus, 93.3% of all eligible patients received thrombolysis. The main contraindication to thrombolysis was a presentation more than six hours from onset of symptoms in 26 patients (52%). Intravenous beta-blockade was indicated for 17 patients (34%), six patients were actually treated resulting in a therapeutic coverage of 35.3%. Heart failure in 21 patients (42%) was the main contraindication. Aspirin was indicated for 48 patients (96%). However, only 14 were treated giving a therapeutic coverage of 29.2%. A large majority of our patients with an acute myocardial infarction were eligible to receive aspirin which has been a neglected therapeutic modality.", 
    "15": "Drug use among athletes has become a recognised problem in sports. Athletes may use drugs for therapeutic indications, for recreational or social reasons, as ergogenic aids or to mask the presence of other drugs during drug testing. Stimulants were some of the first drugs used and studied as ergogenic aids. Amphetamines may increase time to exhaustion by masking the physiological response to fatigue. Caffeine may improve utilisation of fatty acids as a fuel source thereby sparing muscle glycogen. Cocaine and other sympathomimetic drugs have little or no effect on athletic performance. Anabolic steroids appear to have the potential to increase lean muscle mass and strength under certain conditions. Human growth hormone may also be used for an anabolic effect, but data on this effect are lacking. Erythropoietin may represent a pharmacological alternative to blood doping by increasing red blood cell mass. The use of narcotic analgesics is not necessarily ergogenic but can be harmful if used to allow participation of an athlete with a severe injury. According to the American College of Sports Medicine alcohol does not possess an ergogenic effect. However, it may be used to reduce anxiety or tremor prior to competition. Marijuana does not increase strength. Tobacco products may produce psychomotor effects or control appetite which may be beneficial to some athletes. Other drugs used by athletes include beta-blocking agents, diuretics, and a variety of nutritional supplements. In addition, diuretics and probenecid may be taken to mask drug contents in the urine. Whether the ergogenic effects are real or perceived, the potential for adverse effects exists for all of these drugs. Potential health complications represent a serious risk to an otherwise healthy population. Further research on the long term health risks in athletes taking ergogenic drugs is needed.", 
    "16": "We questioned whether carbon monoxide hypoxia (COH) would affect peripheral blood flow by neural activation of adrenoceptors to the extent we had found in other forms of hypoxia. We studied this problem in hindlimb muscles of four groups of anesthetized dogs (untreated, alpha 1-blocked, alpha 1 + alpha 2-blocked, and beta 2-blocked). Cardiac output increased, but hindlimb blood flow (QL) and resistance (RL) remained at prehypoxic levels during COH (O2 content reduced 50%) in untreated animals. When activity in the sciatic nerve was reversibly cold blocked, QL doubled and RL decreased 50%. These changes with nerve block were the same during COH, suggesting that neural activity to hindlimb vasculature was not increased by COH. In animals treated with phenoxybenzamine (primarily alpha 1-blocked), RL dropped (approximately 50%) during COH, an indication that catecholamines played a significant role in maintaining tone to skeletal muscle. Animals with both alpha 1 + alpha 2-adrenergic blockade (phenoxybenzamine and yohimbine added) did not survive COH. RL was higher in beta 2-block than in the untreated group during COH, but nerve cooling indicated that beta 2-adrenoceptor vasodilation was accomplished primarily by humoral means. The above findings demonstrated that adrenergic receptors were important in the regulation of QL and RL during COH, but they were not activated by sympathetic nerve stimulation to the limb muscles.", 
    "17": "We investigated the use of metered-dose beta agonist inhalers (MDIs) by means of 17-item questionnaires from the standpoint of psychosomatic medicine in 56 subjects with bronchial asthma. The results can be summarized as follows: 1) Many asthmatics with neurotic characters used MDIs frequently; Thirteen percent of them suffered adverse effects. The number of times the inhalers were used increased in proportion to the severity and the duration of illness. Fifteen percent of the subjects used MDIs frequently because of anxiety. 2) Fifty percent of the subjects, most of them had neurotic or alexithymic characters, used MDIs without suffering from dyspnea or wheezes; the subjects who used MDIs because of anxiety increased in proportion to the duration of illness. 3) Seventy eight percent of the subjects were anxious about asthmatic attack when they did not carry any MDI; sixty two percent of the subjects, most of them had neurotic or alexithymic characters, actually experienced asthmatic attack. 4) Seventy three percent of the subjects used MDIs secretly; sixty percent of the subjects did not like to inhale in the presence of others. 5) There were some subjects who acted incorrectly on or after asthmatic attack when MDIs were not effective.", 
    "18": "The responses of the urethra to hypogastric nerve (HGN) and lumbosacral sympathetic chain (SC) stimulation were observed in 25 chloralose-anesthetized cats. Urethral perfusion pressure was monitored as an index of functional urethral responses. SC was stimulated at four points from L4 to S1. Urethral constrictive response induced by HGN stimulation (delta P:HGN) was significantly larger in male cats than in female cats. But there was no difference between male and female cats in urethral constrictive response induced by SC stimulation (delta P:SC). delta P:HGN was significantly larger than delta P:SC in both sexes, and the ratio of delta P:HGN to delta P:SC (L7-S1) was 2.7 to 1 in male cats and 1.7 to 1 in female cats. delta P:HGN was blocked by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (1-2 mg/kg) and reduced about 50% by autonomic ganglion blockade with hexamethonium bromide (2 mg/min, 25-50 mg). delta P:SC was blocked by both phenotolamine and hexamethonium bromide. In order to examine the pathways of projections of sympathetic fibers from the sacral SC to the urethra, HGN, pelvic nerve and pudendal nerve were transected serially. delta P:SC (L7-S1) was decreased 0%, 12% and 50% by transection of HGN, pelvic nerve and pudendal nerve, respectively. After severance of these three nerves, delta P:SC (L7-S1) was reduced 62%, but not abolished. These data suggest: 1) The effect of HGN to the feline urethra is more prominent than that of SC in both sexes and significantly larger response was noted in male cats with HGN stimulation but not with SC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether the anabolic effects of clenbuterol in rat skeletal muscle are mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. Female rats were treated with clenbuterol, alone or in combination with either the nonselective beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist sotalol, or the beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist ICI118551. Clenbuterol caused an increase in muscle growth, accompanied by a reduction in beta 2-adrenoceptor density in the rat hind-limb. Both actions were attenuated by sotalol. However, at the dose tested ICI118551 was the more effective antagonist of the muscle growth response, and when given alone, ICI118551 caused significant muscle atrophy. An increase in the weight of the heart was also observed in clenbuterol-treated rats, and again while this effect was attenuated by sotalol, it was reversed by ICI118551. It is concluded that beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate the anabolic effects of clenbuterol in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and that they play an important physiological role in the growth and maintenance of muscle mass in the rat hind-limb.", 
    "20": "To study whether in the (denervated) transplanted human heart beta-adrenoceptors are up-regulated we determined in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies (weighing 2-7 mg) of 8 heart transplant recipients beta-adrenoceptor density and beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio in weekly, later monthly intervals for 6-18 posttransplant months. beta-adrenoceptor density was assessed by 1-2 concentration (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP, 200 and 150 pmol/l) binding, the beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio by a beta 1-adrenoceptor saturating concentration of the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 A (500 nmol/l). In biopsies taken from the donor hearts immediately before transplantation beta-adrenoceptor density was 64.5 +/- 6.3 fmol ICYP bound/mg protein (n = 5), the beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio 81.2 +/- 2.2:18.8 +/- 2.2%. beta-Adrenoceptor density did not change during the whole period investigated; it was in the first 9 posttransplant weeks 73.1 +/- 8.3 (n = 22) and after 4-18 months 74.2 +/- 7.6 fmol/mg protein (n = 16). In contrast, with increasing posttransplant time beta 1:beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio was shifted towards beta 2-adrenoceptors: in the first 9 weeks it was 80:20% (n = 17), after 16 weeks 75:25% (n = 10) and after 25-80 weeks 65:35% (n = 7). We conclude that in the first 18 posttransplant months beta-adrenoceptors in the transplanted human heart are not up-regulated. There is, however, a gradual decline in beta 1- and increase in beta 2-adrenoceptors with increasing posttransplant time. As noradrenaline acts in the human heart solely at beta 1-adrenoceptors, while adrenaline activates both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors with about the same potency, with increasing posttransplant time (and increasing proportion of beta 2-adrenoceptors) adrenaline may play an important role for regulation of contractility and/or heart rate in heart transplant recipients.", 
    "21": "The main aim of conservative treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in portal hypertension is aim to treat and prevent esophageal variceal hemorrhage. Controlled trials show that the hemostasis rate following vaso-active therapy (vasopressin and analogues, somatostatin) is only slightly superior to the spontaneous hemostasis rate. Complications caused by vasopressin treatment can be avoided by concomitant application of nitroglycerin or by alternative treatment with somatostatin. Balloon tamponade is slightly superior to vasopressin for arresting variceal hemorrhage. Injection sclerotherapy influences acute bleeding most positively. Analysis of controlled trials favors sclerotherapy for prophylaxis of rebleeding, but beta-adrenoceptor blockers appear to be almost equally good.", 
    "22": "Increased sympathetic tone is one physiopathological mechanism of vasovagal syncope. In this case, betablocker therapy is logical. The reports in the literature suggest that the head-up tilt test can reliably reproduce vasovagal syncope. Ten patients (4 men and 6 women, mean age 59 +/- 18 years) who suffered from recurrent vasovagal syncopes (2 to 10 attacks in 6 patients and more than 10 in the other 4) with a positive initial head-up tilt test (syncope or severe dizziness with marked hypotension after a maximum of 40 minutes at 60 degrees) were treated with atenolol (200 mg daily in 7 cases and 100 mg daily in the other 3). A second head-up tilt test was performed 15 +/- 6 days later under betablocker therapy; this test was negative in 7 and remained positive in 3 cases. Irrespective of the result, the 10 patients followed the same therapy at the same dosage. After 9 +/- 5 months, 3 patients had another syncopal attack; 2 stopped taking their medication and the third patient continued the betablocker because there was a marked reduction in the frequency of his attacks. There were no further syncopal episodes during follow-up of the other 7 patients. The medium-term efficacy could not be predicted from the results of the second head-up tilt test. The following conclusions may be drawn from this study: The head-up tilt test becomes negative in 70% of cases after introducing betablocker therapy, assuming a 100% reproductivity. This treatment is effective in over half the patients at medium term and should be considered in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope.", 
    "23": "Very rapid changes in activity of transglutaminase (TG), a calcium-dependent enzyme contributing to cross-linkage formation of intracellular polypeptide chains, were observed in vitro in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and nodose ganglion (NG) following application of cholinergic or adrenergic agonists and antagonists. In SCG, a tissue rich in synapses, the depolarizing agent acetylcholine (ACh, 0.1 mM) produced an 8.7-fold increase in TG activity within 5 min that lasted for 30 min and returned to control levels by 2 h. In contrast, the ACh-induced increase in TG activity in NG, a tissue containing neuronal cell bodies with few synapses, was more gradual and of smaller magnitude, reaching a peak of approximately 2.4 times control by 30 min that was maintained for at least 2 h. In both tissues the ACh-stimulation was effectively blocked by the nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium (0.1 mM), whereas the muscarinic antagonist, atropine (0.1 mM), partially blocked the ACh effect in SCG and was without effect in NG. Addition of the hyperpolarizing adrenergic agonists norepinephrine (NE, 50 microM), isoproterenol (0.2 mM) or dopamine (0.1 mM) produced an inhibition of TG activity in SCG but had no effect in NG. The inhibitory effects of the adrenergic agonists in SCG were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (10 microM) and alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine (10 microM). A kinetic study revealed that the ACh-induced stimulation of TG activity in SCG and NG was a result of decrease in apparent Km and an increase in Vmax value, whereas the NE-induced inhibition of SCG enzyme activity was a result of an increased Km and decreased Vmax. 45Ca2+ influx into excised SCG or NG was significantly reduced by the application of either ACh or NE. The ACh inhibition was effectively blocked by either hexamethonium or atropine. The NE inhibition was more effectively blocked by yohimbine than by propranolol. These results suggest that the rapid alterations of TG activity in SCG produced by cholinergic and adrenergic neurotransmitters are attributable to the processes of receptor-mediated depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively, via modulation of nerve-impulse-induced Ca2+ fluxes during synaptic activity.", 
    "24": "To gain further insight into the central nervous system (CNS)-action of beta-adrenergic blocking agents (beta-blockers), we examined the effects of various kinds of beta-blockers on opioid receptors (Op-Rs) using radiolabeled receptor assay (RRA). We demonstrated that beta-blockers are competitively bound to Op-Rs in the CNS. Sodium index of beta-blockers in [3H]naloxone binding study indicated that beta-blockers had the mixed agonist-antagonist activity of opiates. The relative potency of beta-blockers in opioid RRA was negatively correlated with their membrane stabilizing activity. Neither beta-blocking activity nor intrinsic sympathomimetic activity was correlated with IC50 values of beta-blockers in opioid RRA. While it is widely accepted that beta-blockers have a tranquilizing activity, a part of the tranquilizing action of beta-blockers may be mediated through Op-Rs in the CNS. Although beta-blockers may have effects on their own receptors (beta-receptors) in the CNS, the more precise mechanisms of central action of these drugs must be further investigated.", 
    "25": "In this study, we examined the effects of three different beta-blockers, propranolol, pindolol, and metoprolol, on membrane phospholipid preservation in the ischemic and reperfused rat heart. Isolated rat hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer by the Langdendorff technique in the presence or absence of propranolol, pindolol, or metroprolol (20 microM each) for 15 mins at 37 degrees C. Hearts where then either made ischemic alone at 37 degrees C for 30 mins, or followed by 30 mins of reperfusion. Coronary flow and perfusate creatine kinase content were monitored during both pre- and post-ischemic periods. At the end of the experiment, hearts were frozen by freeze-clamping at liquid nitrogen temperature. Membrane phospholipids, fatty acid composition of these phospholipids, non-esterified free fatty acids, and myocardial thiobabituric acid (TBA) reactive product were examined in these hearts. The beta-blocker-treated hearts exhibited significantly less lipid peroxidation than the control hearts (P less than 0.05), as indicated by decreased formation of TBA reactive product and the higher percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in the phosphatidylcholine (PC) in heart. In addition, compared to the control group, less accumulation of free fatty acids was observed in the propranolol and pindolol treated groups. Finally, reduced myocardial creatine kinase release and enhanced recovery of coronary flow indicated significant myocardial preservation by these beta-blockers. The efficacy of these beta-blockers were in the following order: propranolol, pindolol, metoprolol. These results suggest that beta-blockers could also protect an ischemic heart from reperfusion injury by preserving the membrane phospholipids.", 
    "26": "A multicentre trial was designed to determine the dose-response and side-effects of esmolol when administered as a single iv bolus prior to induction of anaesthesia for controlling the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. Five hundred and forty-eight patients from 12 university-affiliated centres across Canada were randomized prospectively to receive either placebo (PLAC) or esmolol (E) in a dose of 100 mg (E100) or 200 mg (E200). Study medication was given immediately before induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone 3-5 mg.kg-1 and succinylcholine 1.5 mg.kg-1. Low-dose narcotic (fentanyl 2-3 micrograms.kg-1 or sufentanil 0.3 micrograms.kg-1) or moderate dose narcotic (fentanyl 4-7 micrograms.kg-1) was also given at five of the participating centres, whereas patients in the remaining seven centres received no narcotic. Patients who received PLAC and no narcotic had greater HR and SBP values after tracheal intubation than patients who received either E100 or E200 (P less than 0.005). The proportion of patients whose maximum HR exceeded 110 min-1 was also greater in the PLAC group (22/180) than in either the E100 (10/187) or E200 (9/181) groups (P less than 0.05), but was not different when comparing E100 with E200. Esmolol was less effective in controlling blood pressure, but, in combination with low-dose narcotic, esmolol suppressed the SBP response to tracheal intubation. In the presence of moderate-dose narcotic, however, a decrease in SBP occurred in all three groups following induction of anaesthesia (P less than 0.003), with the largest decrease (17 +/- 4%) occurring in patients who had received E200. The overall incidence of hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg) was greater in the E200 group (33%) than either the E100 (25%) or PLAC (16%) groups (P less than 0.05). Other side-effects, such as bradycardia, bronchospasm or pain on injection, occurred no more frequently in either esmolol group than with placebo. It is concluded that a 100 mg bolus of esmolol is safe and effective for controlling the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation. This dose of esmolol combined with a low dose of narcotic (fentanyl 2-3 micrograms.kg-1 or equivalent) results in effective control of both heart rate and blood pressure, while avoiding important side-effects.", 
    "27": "A double-blind, randomized study was undertaken to determine if the alpha-agonist apraclonidine has an additive effect in eyes treated with long-term timolol. Seventeen patients (15 with primary open-angle glaucoma, 1 with pigmentary glaucoma, and 1 glaucoma suspect) on long-term timolol treatment in both eyes received a single dose of apraclonidine in one eye and a placebo in the other. Aqueous flow and intraocular pressure were compared in the treated and untreated eyes. There was no statistically significant difference in pretreatment aqueous flow between the two eyes. When flow in the apraclonidine-treated eyes (1.39 +/- 0.41 microliter/min, mean +/- standard deviation) was compared with that of the untreated eyes (1.66 +/- 0.38 microliter/min), a statistically significant difference was found (P less than 0.01). Apraclonidine reduced intraocular pressure by 1.3 mmHg (P = 0.05). The implications of these findings on the understanding of the mechanism of action of adrenergic drugs in the human eye is discussed.", 
    "28": "Early passage bovine brain capillary endothelial cells were immortalized by transfection with the plasmid pSV3 neo. Cells from one clone, SV-BEC, expressed nuclear SV 40 large T antigen, displayed a contact-inhibited and anchorage-dependent proliferation, and a high sensitivity to the addition of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor. SV-BEC cells are morphologically unaltered and express typical markers of endothelial cells: Factor VIII-related antigen, angiotensin-converting enzyme and Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin binding site. Endothelium like immunoreactivity was detected in the conditioned medium from these cells. Moreover, SV-BECs present numerous intercellular tight junctions characteristic of the blood-brain barrier and possess functional beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, as observed on isolated bovine brain capillaries.", 
    "29": "Tetanus is often accompained by autonomic instability, rendering hemodynamic management difficult. Death is frequently secondary to an inability to control this instability. A variety of modalities have been used to stabilize the cardiovascular system, but all are not ideal. Esmolol offers theoretical advantages over other modalities. We report a case of severe tetanus in which a continuous infusion of esmolol was effective in controlling the autonomic instability.", 
    "30": "Water uptake from the skin changes dermally applied near-saturated solutions of beta-blockers in microemulsion-bases into supersaturated microemulsions. Due to an enhanced thermodynamic activity, high absorption rates are expected from these preparations. The pharmacodynamic effect after dermal administration of such preparations has been evaluated using rabbits as a suitable in-vivo model. The dose dependency, influence of lipophilicity and of the thermodynamic activity of the drug is described. Assessment of dermal doses which were therapeutically equivalent to i.v. doses as, for example, shown with carazolol is possible. Although not all observed pharmacodynamic effects were due to these influences but rather due to the numerous other skin-vehicle-drug interactions which could not be explained with this model, the presented in-vivo model is helpful in evaluation of beta-blockers which were suitable candidates for transdermal administration.", 
    "31": "Experiments were conducted to examine the hypothesis that increased neuronal discharge activity of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) above resting discharge rates can alter forebrain electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Small infusions (70-135 nl) of the cholinergic agonist bethanechol within 500 microns of the LC were used to activate this nucleus reversibly in halothane-anesthetized rats. A combined recording-infusion probe allowed verification of this electrophysiological activation. Simultaneously, EEG activity was recorded from sites in the frontal cortex and hippocampus and subjected to power-spectrum analyses. The findings were (1) LC activation was consistently followed, within 5 to 30 sec, by a shift from low-frequency, high-amplitude to high-frequency, low-amplitude EEG activity in frontal neocortex and by the appearance of intense theta-rhythm in the hippocampus; (2) forebrain EEG changes followed LC activation with similar latencies whether infusions were made lateral or medial to the LC; (3) infusions placed outside the immediate vicinity of the LC were not followed by these forebrain EEG effects; (4) following infusion-induced activation, forebrain EEG returned to preinfusion patterns with about the same time course as the recovery of LC activity (10-20 min for complete recovery). These infusion-induced effects on EEG activity were blocked or severely attenuated by pretreatment with the alpha 2-agonist clonidine, which inhibits LC discharge and norepinephrine release, or the beta-antagonist propranolol. These observations indicate that enhanced LC discharge activity is the crucial mediating event for the infusion-induced changes in forebrain EEG activity observed under these conditions and suggest that LC activation may be sufficient to induce EEG signs of cortical and hippocampal activation.", 
    "32": "Treatment with beta 1-selective antagonists causes selective sensitization of isolated strips of human atrial myocardium to the inotropic action of epinephrine and beta 2-agonists but not of norepinephrine. To determine whether beta 1-selective antagonist treatment alters the responsiveness of cardiac beta 2-adrenoreceptors in vivo, we measured the positive chronotropic responses to salbutamol injected into the right coronary artery. Ten patients treated with atenolol (50-100 mg daily) were compared with 10 patients not treated with beta-blockers. The mean dose required to cause an increase in heart rate of 30 beats/min was 2.29 micrograms (log dose 0.36 +/- 0.12 micrograms [mean +/- SEM]) in the atenolol-treated patients. In the non-beta-blocker-treated patients, the dose required to cause an increase in heart rate of 30 beats/min was significantly greater, 8.91 micrograms (log dose 0.95 +/- 0.11 micrograms) (p less than 0.005). We conclude that treatment with beta 1-selective beta-blockers leads to increased cardiac responsiveness to beta 2-adrenoreceptor stimulation. This may be the underlying mechanism of the beta-blocker withdrawal syndrome and may make the heart more susceptible to the adverse effects of epinephrine in situations of stress (e.g., myocardial infarction).", 
    "33": "We report the intraoperative use of esmolol for control of arterial pressure during repair of a traumatic transection of the descending thoracic aorta. A mean infusion rate of esmolol 50.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 resulted in a decrease in mean arterial pressure to 63 mm Hg and heart rate to 99 beat min-1 and was associated with excellent surgical conditions. The infusion rate of esmolol was titrated easily against mean arterial pressure, which increased rapidly on discontinuing its infusion. Control of arterial pressure with esmolol was comparable to that achieved with sodium nitroprusside, but without the reflex tachycardia or decrease in Pao2 associated with the latter agent.", 
    "34": "Approximately 10% of western populations are genetically deficient in the enzyme that metabolizes the antihypertensive drug debrisoquin. These \"poor metabolizers\" process many common medications in an aberrant fashion, resulting in a variety of untoward consequences including exaggerated drug effect, subtherapeutic drug concentrations, or complex drug interactions. A variety of medications, including neuroleptics, antidepressants, beta-blockers, and certain antiarrhythmics, are subject to the influence of this metabolic polymorphism. Quinidine administration changes persons to poor metabolizers of debrisoquin for the duration of therapy. Thus, the use of quinidine with any of the other drugs metabolized by this isozyme may be expected to result in a drug interaction in which a person's response will mimic that of a poor metabolizer. Because no test is commonly available to determine directly the debrisoquin metabolic phenotype, clinicians should be alert to unusual drug reactions in patients receiving quinidine concurrently with the other medications.", 
    "35": "The present experiments were aimed at evaluating the acute effects of exercise on lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in untrained rats. The activity of LPL was measured in postheparin plasma (PHP) before and at various times after a 1-h run on a treadmill (22 m/min, O degrees grade). LPL in PHP was 50% below pre-exercise levels immediately and 3 h after the run but was increased 65% over resting levels 24 h postexercise. To further characterize the very early fall in LPL activity in response to exercise and to assess the possible involvement therein of the beta-adrenergic pathway, LPL in heart, vastus lateralis muscle (VLM), and white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues was determined at rest and immediately after exercise in rats that were treated or not with nadolol (25 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 30 days). Immediately after 1 h of exercise, there was a reduction in total enzyme activity in WAT (40% below resting levels), BAT (-58%), VLM (-53%), and heart (-30%). Exercise reduced serum triacylglycerol levels (-64%) and doubled those of nonesterified fatty acids. beta-Adrenergic blockade did not affect any of these variables. Both exercise and nadolol lowered serum cholesterol levels by approximately 20%, but the effects were not additive. These results show that the global intravascular pool of LPL undergoes divergent, time-dependent alterations in response to a single bout of moderate exercise. The acute downregulation of postheparin plasma LPL immediately after exercise reflected a fall in the total enzyme pool of all tissues studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "To assess the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the development of genetic hypertension, blood pressure (BP) was recorded in conscious adult Lyon hypertensive (LH) and normotensive (LN) rats that had received daily injections of saline or guanethidine at 1-13 wk of age. Guanethidine abolished the pressor response to tyramine, decreased plasma norepinephrine by greater than 70% and plasma 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol by approximately 90%, and did not change plasma epinephrine. Bilateral adrenalectomy further reduced plasma norepinephrine to 8 and 5% of control levels in LH and LN rats, respectively. BP was lowered (-7%) in sympathectomized rats, but the mean absolute BP difference between LH and LN rats was unaltered. Despite marked supersensitivity to alpha-adrenoreceptor stimulation, phentolamine induced only a small transient depressor response, which was abolished by adrenalectomy in sympathectomized rats. It is concluded that the sympathetic nervous system is not necessary for the development of hypertension in LH rats. After sympathectomy, circulating catecholamines, which mostly derive from the adrenal medulla, play only a minor role in BP maintenance.", 
    "37": "The diagnostic value of exercise-induced ST segment depression is considered to be decreased in patients receiving beta-blockers. One approach to improving predictive accuracy has been to use the ratio of maximal change in exercise-induced ST segment depression to the corresponding maximal change in heart rate (delta ST/HR index). The present study compared these two ECG methods. The records of exercise tests performed on 3047 male veterans were screened to exclude patients with prior revascularization procedures or myocardial infarction, those receiving digoxin, and those with certain resting ECG abnormalities; the use of beta-blocker drugs at the time of testing was also noted. All exercise tests were sign/symptom limited. Significant angiographic coronary disease was defined as greater than or equal to 75% reduction in luminal diameter of at least one coronary artery. Disease severity was evaluated in an expanded study group that included patients with prior myocardial infarction. Mean maximal heart rate was 21 beats.min-1 lower for those receiving beta-blockers (p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in mean metabolic equivalent (MET) level achieved. The diagnostic accuracy of an abnormal test result for determination of the presence or absence of coronary artery disease was not significantly different in the subgroup taking beta-blockers versus the subgroup not taking beta-blockers (N = 200), and use of the delta ST/HR index did not improve test performance. For discrimination of severe disease, test accuracy was also unaffected by beta-blockers and was not improved by the delta ST/HR index (N = 454).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Although the efficacy of long-term administration of antithrombotic agents in unstable angina has been established, short-term effects on myocardial ischemia are unknown. A retrospective analysis was performed in 47 patients undergoing three-channel continuous ST segment monitoring as part of a multicenter trial using esmolol in unstable angina, in which 20 patients received a continuous heparin infusion during the initial assessment of chest pain. Concomitant medications included calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, nitrates, and aspirin in the majority of patients. Clinical variables between the heparin and no heparin groups were similar, except for fewer males and fewer total artery occlusions in the heparin group. No significant differences in the incidence or duration of ischemia were found in a 36 +/- 16 hour monitoring period. Forty percent of the heparin group had 35 episodes of ischemia with a mean of 11 +/- 10 minutes per episode and a total ischemic time of 48 +/- 39 minutes per patient with ischemia. Forty-four percent of the no heparin group had 47 episodes of ischemia with a mean of 13 +/- 13 minutes per episode and a total ischemic time of 58 +/- 47 minutes per patient with ischemia. Multiple linear regression analysis to adjust for intergroup differences did not alter the results. Eighty-five percent of all episodes were asymptomatic. Clinical events, such as episodes of chest pain, emergency coronary arteriography, or coronary revascularization, were also similar between groups. Thus the short-term administration of heparin did not alter the incidence or duration of ischemia in patients with unstable angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Asymmetric synthesis of the diastereomeric 7-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-[1-hydroxy-2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl]benzofurans (2), the benzylic hydroxylation metabolites of bufuralol (1), is described, and the absolute configurations of these diastereomers are assigned. 1\"-Oxobufuralol (3) was reduced with a complex of (2S)-(-)-2-amino-3-methyl-1,1-diphenylbutan-1-ol and borane, yielding 2, which had a 95:5 ratio of the possible 1\"R and 1\"S isomers as determined by HPLC. Separation of the resulting diastereomers was facilitated by derivatization with the enantiomers of 1-phenethyl isocyanate (PEIC). The absolute configurations 1'S,1\"R and 1'R,1\"R were assigned to the diastereomers formed in excess, 2c and 2b, on the basis of the known stereochemistry of reduction of closely related alkyl phenyl ketones to R alcohols by using this chiral borane reagent. The circular dichroism spectra of the four isomeric benzylic alcohols were in agreement with these assignments. In the presence of the rat liver microsomal fraction, benzylic hydroxylation of bufuralol was significantly product stereoselective favoring formation of diastereomers with the 1\"R absolute stereochemistry at the new chiral center in products from (1'R)-1 by a ratio of 4.5:1 [(1'R,1\"R)-2:(1'R,1\"S)-2] and by nearly 8:1 [(1'S,1\"R)-2:(1'S,1\"S)-2] from (1'S)-1. (1'R)-Bufuralol was more rapidly hydroxylated than was (1'S)-1, by about 3-fold. In the presence of human liver microsomes, (1'R)-bufuralol was also more rapidly hydroxylated than was (1'S)-1, by ca. 2.5-fold. However, product stereoselectivity from the 1'R enantiomer was reversed from that observed in the rat liver microsomal oxidation, with more (1\"S)-carbinol being formed than 1\"R isomer by nearly 4-fold. From (1'S)-1, about equal amounts of the two possible hydroxybufuralol diastereomers were formed. The results from the human liver microsomal studies are consistent with observed enantioselectivity of hydroxylation of bufuralol in vivo in humans.", 
    "40": "Interactions of dl-flerobuterol with central beta adrenoceptors were investigated. It inhibited the binding of [3H]CGP 12177, a selective beta adrenoceptor ligand, to membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex, cerebellum, heart and lung. The affinity of dl-flerobuterol was very close in all tissues (Ki approximately 1 microM). In cerebral cortex, binding inhibition of [3H]CGP 12177 was stereospecific, l-flerobuterol (Ki = 483 nM) being 70-fold more potent than d-flerobuterol (Ki = 34 microM). Moreover, dl-flerobuterol (Ki = 926 nM) was 7-fold less potent than isoproterenol (Ki = 140 nM) to displace [3H]CGP 12177 binding, but 5-fold more potent than salbutamol (Ki = 4600 nM). Flerobuterol did not inhibit the radioligand binding to the other receptors at the highest concentration tested, thus leading to a very high beta adrenergic selectivity. Flerobuterol increased the concentration of cyclic AMP in slices of rat cerebral cortex in a dose-dependent manner; this effect was antagonized by atenolol and propranolol. Compared to isoproterenol or norepinephrine, which produced cyclic AMP maximal increases of 380 and 460%, respectively, it showed a weaker activity with a maximal stimulation obtained at 100 microM, corresponding to a cAMP increase of 140% over basal value (100%). These data revealed that flerobuterol possessed a beta adrenergic agonist activity. Moreover, it antagonized competitively the isoproterenol- or norepinephrine-stimulated accumulation of cAMP. At low concentrations of isoproterenol or norepinephrine, the stimulation of adenylate cyclase was only due to the action of flerobuterol, but at higher concentrations, the response of isoproterenol or norepinephrine was competitively blocked by flerobuterol. At 10 microM, isoproterenol surmounted fully this antagonism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "The relaxant effects of beta adrenoceptor agonists were investigated in isolated bovine mesenteric lymphatics which had been contracted by 5-hydroxytryptamine. Addition of isoproterenol (a nonselective beta agonist), denopamine (a selective beta-1 agonist) and procaterol (a selective beta-2 agonist) caused concentration-dependent relaxations in the lymphatic preparations. There was no significant difference in the relaxant responses to the beta adrenoceptor agonists between the preparations with and without endothelium. Treatment with 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-6) M metoprolol (a selective beta-1 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for denopamine to the right, whereas 10(-9) to 3 x 10(-8) M ICI 118,551 (a selective beta-2 antagonist) did not affect the relaxant response to denopamine. The relaxations of bovine mesenteric lymphatics induced by isoproterenol were suppressed by both metoprolol and ICI 118,551. The procaterol-induced relaxations were inhibited by 10(-9) to 3 x 10(-8) M ICI 118,551 but not by 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-6) M metoprolol. Schild plot analyses showed that the slope and pA2 values for metoprolol against denopamine were 1.10 and 7.59, respectively, and that those for ICI 118,551 against procaterol were 0.91 and 9.96. These results suggest that both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenoceptors are located on the smooth muscle cells in bovine mesenteric lymphatics and that stimulation of either receptor produces a marked relaxation.", 
    "42": "Catecholamine tachyphylaxia was investigated in human s.c. adipose tissue in situ by using microdialysis. The tissue was dialyzed with adrenergic agents (10(-8) mol/l) and the glycerol concentration (lipolysis index) was determined. Perfusion with adrenaline caused a 3-fold rise in the glycerol concentration, which peaked at 30 min and then (within 1 hr) declined to a level 75% higher than base line; the latter elevation was constant for at least 2 hr. Noradrenaline or isoprenaline in the absence and presence of a selective beta-2 receptor antagonist, or the selective beta-1 adrenergic agonist dobutamine, caused a 2- to 2.5-fold transient lipolytic response which also peaked at 30 min but then (within 3 hr) declined to the base-line level. On the other hand, isoprenaline plus a selective beta-1 receptor antagonist or the beta-2 selective adrenergic agonist terbutaline caused a constant lipolytic effect for at least 3 hr. Noradrenaline or adrenaline plus a nonselective beta adrenergic antagonist as well as the alpha-2 selective adrenergic antagonist clonidine caused a sustained antilipolytic action for at least 3 hr. In conclusion, the adrenoceptor subtypes involved in lipolysis regulation in humans have different in vivo sensitivities to homologous desensitization. Beta-2 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors are resistant in this respect whereas activation of beta-1 adrenoceptors leads to rapid desensitization. However, simultaneous beta-1 and beta-2 receptor activation is accompanied by different degrees of tachyphylaxia, indicating regulatory in vivo interactions within this receptor family in human adipose tissue.", 
    "43": "A new high-precision ultrasonic device was developed to determine noninvasively arterial compliance as a function of blood pressure. Because of the nonlinear elastic properties of arterial walls, measurements of compliance can be appropriately compared only if obtained over a range of pressures. This apparatus was used to evaluate in a double-blind, parallel fashion the effect of three different antihypertensive drugs and of a placebo on radial artery compliance. Thirty-two normotensive volunteers were randomly allocated to an 8-day, once-a-day oral treatment with either a placebo, 100 mg atenolol, 20 mg nitrendipine, or 20 mg lisinopril. Blood pressure, heart rate, radial artery diameter, and arterial compliance were measured immediately before as well as 6 hours after dosing on the first and last days of the study. On the eighth day of administration, within 6 hours after dosing, lisinopril induced an acute increase in radial artery diameter, from 2.99 +/- 0.06 to 3.28 +/- 0.09 mm (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01). The compliance-pressure curve was shifted upward on day 1 (p less than 0.01) as well as on day 8 (p less than 0.05). None of the other drugs induced any significant modification of these parameters. Arterial compliance has a strong nonlinear dependency on intra-arterial pressure and therefore has to be defined as a function of pressure. Antihypertensive drugs acting by different mechanisms may have different effects on the mechanical properties of large arteries.", 
    "44": "Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism at rest and during exercise were investigated in 21 patients with heart failure. The patients were evaluated before and after long-term treatment (14 +/- 7 months) with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol. Clinical improvement with increased functional capacity occurred during treatment. Maximal work load increased by 25% (104 to 130 W; p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic data showed an increased cardiac index (3.8 to 4.6 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.02) during exercise. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased at rest (20 to 13 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and during exercise (32 to 28 mm Hg; p = NS). Stroke volume index (30 to 39 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) and stroke work index (28 to 46 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) increased during exercise and long-term metoprolol treatment. The arterial norepinephrine concentration decreased at rest (3.72 to 2.19 nmol/liter; p less than 0.02) but not during exercise (13.2 to 11.1 nmol/liter; p = NS). The arterial-coronary sinus norepinephrine difference suggested a decrease in myocardial spillover during metoprolol treatment (-0.28 to -0.13 nmol/liter; p = NS at rest and -1.13 to -0.27 nmol/liter; p less than 0.05 during exercise). Coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged during treatment. Four patients produced myocardial lactate before the study, but none produced lactate after beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). There was no obvious improvement in a subgroup of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In summary, there were signs of increased myocardial work load without higher metabolic costs after treatment with metoprolol.", 
    "45": "In mature animals, thyroid hormone produces parallel up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites and their linkage to adenylate cyclase; during development, these same processes may be critical in establishing the set-point for subsequent adrenergic reactivity. In the current study, we administered triiodothyronine to neonatal rats for the first five days postpartum and evaluated [125I]pindolol binding capabilities and adenylate cyclase activity in membrane preparations from heart and kidney. In the heart, hyperthyroidism elicited an initial increase in receptor density, with subsequent deficits and an eventual return to normal values by young adulthood. In contrast, the ability of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, to stimulate adenylate cyclase was enhanced regardless of whether receptor numbers were increased or decreased; the same effects were also present for basal adenylate cyclase activity and non-receptor-mediated stimulation by forskolin. Enhanced cyclase activity involved both increases in the magnitude of response as well as accelerated onset of the postweaning peak of enzyme activity, results which suggest a direct impact of thyroid status on the ontogenetic expression of adenylate cyclase itself. The kidney, which possesses less efficient beta-receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase in the neonate, was less drastically affected by triiodothyronine for either beta-receptor binding sites or enzyme activity. As we had previously shown that neonatal hyperthyroidism uncouples beta-receptors from growth-related enzymes, such as ornithine decarboxylase, we also evaluated whether the promotion of adenylate cyclase responses was mechanistically linked to effect on ornithine decarboxylase; administration of cyclic AMP analogs to 5 days-old rats led to inhibition of the enzyme in the heart, whereas the same treatment in 9 days-old animals was ineffective. These data suggest that thyroid hormone differentially regulates the development of beta-receptors as well as adenylate cyclase and ornithine decarboxylase, with preferential effects on tissues, such as the heart, that already possess efficient linkage of the receptors to cell transduction mechanisms at birth.", 
    "46": "The current study investigated the early response of some determinants of triacylglycerol (TG) metabolism to acute exercise in rats that were treated or not with the nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker, nadolol (25 mg.kg b.wt.-1.day-1 for 30 days). Measurements of hepatic TG secretion rate (HTGSR), postheparin plasma hepatic TG lipase (HTGL) activity, and that of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in postheparin plasma, heart, vastus lateralis muscle (VLM), white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissues were carried out in untrained rats at rest or immediately after a 1 h run on treadmill (22 m.min-1, 0 degrees grade). All animals were in the fasted state. Exercise reduced serum TG levels (46% below resting levels) and doubled those of nonesterified fatty acids. HTGSR was enhanced (+28%) by exercise while HTGL activity was not modified. The decrease in postheparin plasma LPL activity (-24%) caused by exercise was consistent with a reduction in enzyme activity in WAT (-32%), BAT (-45%) and heart (-25%). One h of treadmill running did not influence LPL activity in VLM. beta-Adrenergic blockade did not affect any of the variables of lipid metabolism, except for a slight decrease in specific activity of LPL in the heart (-14%). This study demonstrates that absolute variations in HTGSR and in LPL activity cannot account for the acute fall in serum TG levels caused by moderate exercise, in fasted, untrained rats. In addition, these results show that the beta-adrenergic pathway is either not involved in, or not necessary for, the latter effects of exercise on TG metabolism.", 
    "47": "To investigate the extrarenal release of renin, plasma active renin (PAR) and plasma trypsin activatable or inactive renin (PIR) in blood taken simultaneously from bilateral median cubital veins were measured in seven normal men before and after occlusion of the right upper arm with a standard cuff inflated halfway between systolic and diastolic blood pressures for 15 min. After 15 min, both PAR (P less than 0.05) with PIR (P less than 0.01) increased significantly in occluded arms compared with 0 min. PIR rose significantly (P less than 0.01) in occluded arms compared with controls at 15 min, but PAR was unchanged. The same studies were repeated after pretreatment with oral doses of either 1 mg prazosin or 10 mg propranolol at 1600 h and 2400 h on the previous day and 1 hour before the experiment. After prazosin, both PAR (P less than 0.05) and PIR (P less than 0.01) in occluded arms increased significantly at 15 min compared with those at 0 min and PIR rose significantly (P less than 0.01) in occluded arms compared with controls at 15 min, as observed in the control studies. On the other hand, after propranolol, the significant increment of PAR in the occluded arms was abolished. Moreover, the significant difference of PIR between the occluded and the control arms at 15 min was also abolished. These results indicate that inactive renin may be present in the vascular wall of the arm and released into circulation by a stimulus such as arm occlusion by mechanisms related to beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "48": "Tissue oxygen tension, peroxidation of lipids (malonic dialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase activity), fatty acid, spectrum and phospholipid composition in the red blood cells, Na+, K(+)-ATPase were studied in 11 healthy children and 21 with cyanotic heart disease. The beta-adrenoblocker obsidan was used in the multimodality treatment of 10 patients. Unlike healthy children, the patients had decreased tissue oxygen tension, intensified lipid peroxidation, an altered lipid profile in the red blood cell membranes, their abnormal permeability, diminished intracellular ATP depot. The conventional tools of intensive care (oxygenation, cardiotropic drugs, goal-oriented fluid therapy) are low beneficial. There is evidence for the supplementation of obsidan, a beta-adrenoblocker, to a therapeutical complex for this group of patients. Clinical and metabolic evidence for the positive action of the drug on lipid peroxidation, lipid spectrum in the red blood cell membranes, their permeability and biological energy reactions.", 
    "49": "The present study has examined the time course of autonomic tone changes in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) and one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) renal hypertension. In conscious rats, cardiac sympathetic and vagal tone were determined using propranolol and atropine, respectively. The development of renovascular hypertension was accompanied by a significant tachycardia, increase in cardiac sympathetic tone and decrease in cardiac vagal tone. In the isolated perfused heart we observed a reduced chronotropic response to isoproterenol. These alterations were transitory in 2K1C and greater and more persistent in 1K1C renal hypertension. These results show the relative role played by the cardiac sympathetic and vagal systems in the maintenance of tachycardia in renovascular hypertension.", 
    "50": "The cardiac responses to sympathetic and vagal stimulations are attenuated with ageing. To understand these findings, the densities of beta adrenergic (beta R) and muscarinic (MR) receptors in the left ventricles have been quantitated in parallel in male Wistar rats (4- and 24-month-old) using [125I]iodocyanopindolol and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate as specific radioligands. The homologous regulation of these receptor densities was also explored after a 7-day continuous infusion of propranolol or atropine. As compared to young rats, the beta R and MR densities in aged animals were decreased (from 31 +/- 2 to 23 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.05 for beta R; from 104 +/- 7 to 54 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, P less than 0.001 for MR) but the diminution in MR was more pronounced (-48%) than that in beta R (-26%), resulting in a drop in the beta R/MR ratio. Continuous infusion of propranolol or atropine up-regulated the beta R and MR densities (respectively +50%, P less than 0.01 and +33%, P less than 0.05) in aged but not in young adult rats. We therefore conclude: (i) that the diminution of the cardiac response to the sympathetic and vagal stimulations during ageing may be partly explained by a decrease in the corresponding receptor density; (ii) these changes are reversible and the density of these two groups of receptors can return to adult control values by chronic administration of the appropriate antagonist.", 
    "51": "Behavioral stress and high dietary salt have been reported to increase blood pressure additively in non-human primates. This study was designed to replicate this phenomenon and to assess neuroendocrine correlates and responses to two commonly used antihypertensives, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. High-salt intake (240 mmol sodium per day) and stress were administered for 9 weeks in adult baboons. Oral atenolol hydrochloride (50 mg, twice daily) or hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) was administered for 2 weeks each. In all four baboons, salt loading and stress increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) chronically by 14 mmHg, with increases in water intake, urine osmolality and excretion of sodium, decreases in levels of serum sodium, plasma renin activity and plasma vasopressin and no changes in urinary excretion of norepinephrine or epinephrine. Neither drug decreased SBP during ongoing high salt and stress. The results confirm the additive chronic effects of high-dietary salt intake and behavioral stress on blood pressure in non-human primates. The hypertension in this model is resistant to two antihypertensive drugs commonly used clinically.", 
    "52": "We treated 48 patients with intravenous enalaprilat within 24 hours from the onset of acute myocardial infarction. Concomitant therapy included thrombolytic treatment (29), intravenous metoprolol (34), intravenous nitroglycerin (16) and intravenous furosemide (15). The first 40 patients included had systolic blood pressure at baseline greater than or equal to 110 mmHg. Intravenous bolus injections of 0.2-1.2 mg (mean 1.0 mg) enalaprilat in one hour were given to 20 patients and an intravenous infusion of 1 mg over two hours was administered to another 20 patients, as well as to a separate group of 8 patients with systolic blood pressure between 100-109 mmHg at baseline. The infusion was stopped in five cases when the systolic blood pressure fell below 100 and 90 mmHg, respectively, in the two infusion groups. No hypotensive reactions were symptomatic. Blood pressure decreased from a mean of 134/82, 131/79 and 106/72 mmHg to a minimum of 117/71, 118/73 and 97/63 mmHg, respectively, in the three groups. Almost complete suppression of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity was achieved within 30 minutes. No significant changes were found in plasma levels of angiotensin II, renin activity or atrial natriuretic peptide between baseline and 24 hours. Treatment was continued with oral enalapril 2.5-10 mg/day, which was generally well tolerated. We conclude that intravenous and oral enalapril added to conventional therapy in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction is well tolerated in selected patients, but should be carefully titrated.", 
    "53": "1. To assess the role of the vasodepressor prostaglandin system in the antihypertensive properties of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, we investigated the alterations of prostaglandin generation in the kidney and in the aorta when spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with atenolol for 2 weeks. 2. The blood pressure reduction was associated with an increase in urinary sodium excretion and urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion. The sodium excretion was positively related to the prostaglandin E2 excretion. 3. Basal release of prostaglandin E2 from the sliced renal cortex was enhanced by the atenolol treatment. Prostacyclin-generating capacity in the aortic wall was also significantly increased. 4. Atenolol treatment stimulated prostaglandin synthesis in the kidney and vascular wall in a dose-dependent manner. However, atenolol per se did not directly stimulate prostaglandin synthesis in the vascular wall. 5. Inhibition of prostaglandin generation by a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, was associated with attenuation of the antihypertensive effects of atenolol. 6. Thus these data indicate that sub-chronic atenolol treatment stimulates vasodepressor prostaglandin generation in the kidney and in the aortic vessels, and this shares the antihypertensive effects of this drug with the mechanism of beta-adrenergic antagonism probably mediated through vasorelaxation and natriuresis.", 
    "54": "When expressed in Escherichia coli, the human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors retain their ligand binding specificity. Their functional integrity was investigated by analyzing receptor-guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory (G) protein coupling by using two splice variants of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein Gs synthesized in E. coli (rGs alpha-S and rGs alpha-L) and the beta gamma subunits of G protein purified from bovine brain. In competition binding experiments with (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol and (-)-isoproterenol, rGs alpha-S.beta gamma and rGs alpha-L.beta gamma reconstituted guanine nucleotide-sensitive high-affinity agonist binding with comparable affinities, whereas rGs alpha PT, a mutant of rGs alpha-L with an altered carboxyl terminus, and a recombinant subtype of the alpha subunit of the inhibitory G protein, rGi alpha-1, were approximately 20- and approximately 200-fold less potent, respectively. A comparison of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor expressed in E. coli with the beta 2-receptor in S49 murine lymphoma cyc- cell membranes revealed a similar affinity of rGs alpha-S and rGs alpha-L for the recombinant and native receptors. After stable incorporation of rGs alpha-S.beta gamma into E. coli membranes, receptor-G protein coupling was also verified by determining the isoproterenol-mediated acceleration of the rate for guanine 5'-[gamma-[35S]thio]triphosphate binding. These results show that (i) receptor-G protein coupling can be reconstituted in E. coli using recombinant components and that (ii) such an approach may be more generally used to evaluate coupling preferences between defined molecular species of receptors and G-protein subunits.", 
    "55": "Activating the protein-tyrosine kinase of v-Src in BALB/c 3T3 cells results in rapid increases in the intracellular second messenger, diacylglycerol (DAG). v-Src-induced increases in radiolabeled DAG were most readily detected when phospholipids were prelabeled with myristic acid, which is incorporated predominantly into phosphatidylcholine. Consistent with this observation, v-Src increased the level of intracellular choline. No increase in DAG was observed when cells were prelabeled with arachidonic acid, which is incorporated predominantly into phosphatidylinositol. Inhibiting phosphatidic acid (PA) phosphatase, which hydrolyzes PA to DAG, blocked v-Src-induced DAG production and enhanced PA production, implicating a type D phospholipase. Consistent with the involvement of a type D phospholipase, v-Src increased transphosphatidylation activity, which is characteristic of type D phospholipases. Thus, v-Src-induced increases in DAG most likely result from the activation of a type D phospholipase/PA phosphatase-mediated signaling pathway.", 
    "56": "After snorting crystalline cocaine, the nasal and airway mucosa will be exposed to high concentrations of this drug. We have examined the actions of mucosal and serosal cocaine application on the basal short circuit current (Isc) and the changes in Isc (delta Isc) induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and isoproterenol (ISO) across swine tracheal epithelium. Cocaine displacement of muscarinic receptor and beta adrenoceptor radioligands was also examined. Cocaine at low, less than 1 mM, concentrations induced basal Isc to increase in some tissues by 9 to 10 microA in some preparations it induced only a decrease in basal Isc. The maximal decrease was 15 to 20 microA in these preparations. In all tissues 14 mM cocaine decreased basal Isc. The IC50 for the cocaine inhibition of Isc was 3 +/- 0.9 mM after mucosal application. Mucosal cocaine (3 mM) did not affect the actions of mucosal amiloride, an epithelial sodium channel blocker (IC50 = 0.6 +/- .1 microM, control; 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM, in the presence of 3 mM cocaine) or serosal tetraethylammonium, a potassium channel blocker. However, cocaine altered the response of the tissue to ACh and ISO. Cocaine (14 mM) applied mucosally reduced the maximal delta Isc induced by ACh (serosal) to 34 +/- 14% of control. By contrast, serosal cocaine (3 mM) caused a parallel shift to the right in the concentration-response relationships for ACh- and ISO-induced increases in Isc (EC50 increased by approximately 6.3 and approximately 2.5 times, respectively) but did not reduce the maximal response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "We studied halothane/epinephrine interaction in isolated canine trabeculae using the doses of epinephrine necessary to produce slow responses (epinephrine threshold for the development of slow responses, ETSR) as an indicator. The preparations were depolarized in Tyrode's solution containing 26 mmol/L of KCl, then epinephrine concentrations in the solution were increased in a stepwise manner. Halothane (1%) had no significant effect, whereas 2% and 4% halothane significantly increased the ETSR. alpha 1-Blockade with either 4, 8, or 16 ng/mL of prazosin or 20, 40, or 80 ng/mL of droperidol did not alter the ETSR, whereas beta 1-adrenergic blockade with 8, 17, or 34 ng/mL of metoprolol significantly increased the ETSR. The same trend was observed when either 8 ng/mL of prazosin or 17 ng/mL of metoprolol was given in combination with 2% halothane. Verapamil (5, 10, or 20 ng/mL) increased the ETSR in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that halothane decreases rather than increases the sensitivity of slow calcium channels to epinephrine and that any increase above the baseline ETSR after halothane administration cannot be ascribed to halothane/adrenoceptor interaction but rather to calcium entry-blocking effects of halothane. As slow responses are induced by the activation of slow calcium channels, our findings are consistent with known data that halothane can interfere with slow calcium channel conductance.", 
    "58": "The effect of a once a day dose one or one and a half mg bopindolol on mild to moderate hypertensive patients was studied. During the treatment the changes in blood pressure, heart rate, serum triglyceride, cholesterin, HDL cholesterin were examined. The drug was given as monotherapy to 9 previously untreated patients with a mean blood pressure of 163/102 mm Hg. 12 patients, who had received a combination therapy including beta-blocking agents, were treated with bopindolol instead of the previously taken beta-blockers. The initial mean blood pressure of this group was 140/80 mm Hg. The patients' age was between 35 and 72. The observation period was 12 months. The cardiac performance was examined by bicycle ergometry. On the base of the results the authors think that bopindolol is effective in blood pressure lowering both in mono- and combination therapy, and it doesn't increase the level of blood lipids. No side-effects were observed. The results of the bicycle ergometry indicated better cardiac performance. Because of its long duration of action it is important to emphasize that bopindolol in a once a day dose of one or one and a half mg is effective in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertensive patients.", 
    "59": "The effects of chronic administration of antidepressant drugs on beta-adrenergic and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)B receptors have been assessed with radioligand binding. Tricyclics [imipramine (IMI), 30 mg/kg/day, and desmethylimipramine (DMI), 10 mg/kg day] or monoamine oxidase inhibitors [(+/-)-tranylcypromine (TCP), 1 mg/kg/day, and phenelzine (PLZ), 10 mg/kg/day] were administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats by constant infusion via Alzet 2ML4 osmotic minipumps for 28 days. Pumps were implanted s.c. in the interscapular region. On day 28 the animals were killed and their brains removed; [3H]GABA binding to GABAB receptors was measured in frontal cortex and the remaining cortical tissue was used to measure [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding to beta-adrenoceptors. All drugs tested induced a significant decrease in density (Bmax) of [3H]DHA binding, although no significant changes in affinity (Kd) were observed. [3H]GABA binding was not altered significantly by chronic antidepressant treatment. TCP-treated animals showed a tendency towards increased [3H]-GABA binding, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. No effects on Kd were observed. These data do not support the proposal that an increase in the total population of cortical GABAB receptors is a common effect of chronic antidepressant treatment.", 
    "60": "Twenty patients with acute severe hypertension were randomised to therapy with either nifedipine capsules (10 mg) or captopril tablets (25 mg) given sublingually and the blood pressure recorded for 240 minutes. Oral monotherapy with either agent followed for 3 weeks, then the agents were combined for a further 2 weeks and in the final 6 weeks of the trial a beta-blocker and diuretic were added, if needed. Thirteen patients completed the trial. The major results were: (i) nifedipine decreased blood pressure more rapidly than captopril 60 minutes after first ingestion but at 240 minutes equal degrees of fall in blood pressure had been obtained; (ii) neither agent given as sustained monotherapy was able to reduce blood pressure adequately, although nifedipine was better than captopril; and (iii) combination therapy with both agents was conspicuously successful in achieving reduction in blood pressure. It is suggested that combination nifedipine-captopril therapy be subject to a formal trial for early therapy in acute severe hypertension.", 
    "61": "A 58-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of exertional dyspnoea and a cardiac murmur not previously heard. For one year he was known to have left-sided fibrinous pleuritis. For 5 years he had been taking methysergide for cluster headaches. From 1950-1980 he had worked with asbestos-containing insulating material. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was greatly increased to 117/136 mm and there was an hypochromic anaemia (Hb 10.4 g/dl). The cholestasis enzymes were elevated (gamma-GT 88 U/l; alkaline phosphatase 511 U/l). Computed tomography of the thorax demonstrated left-sided pleural thickening of up to 3 cm. Endocarditis was excluded (sterile blood culture; normal echocardiogram). There was no evidence of an infectious, immunological or malignant cause for the pleural fibrosis. One year after pleurectomy and having discontinued methysergide all biochemical tests were normal.", 
    "62": "A chiral stationary phase (CSP) derived from an N-3,5-dinitrobenzoyl-alpha-amino phosphonate was prepared for the direct separation of the enantiomers of underivatized beta-blockers. Structure-chromatographic activity relationships for beta-blockers and closely related analogues are reported for this CSP and are found to be consistent with the model used to design this CSP. The effect of temperature on the chromatographic behavior of beta-blocker enantiomers is unusual. A reduction in temperature reduces the retention of the less retained enantiomer and increases the retention of the more retained enantiomer without appreciable band broadening.", 
    "63": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cortex. Activation of postsynaptic GABAA receptors hyperpolarizes cells and inhibits neuronal activity. Synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors also strongly excited hippocampal neurons. This excitatory response was recorded in morphologically identified interneurons in the presence of 4-aminopyridine or after elevation of extracellular potassium concentrations. The synaptic excitation sustained by GABAA receptors synchronized the activity of inhibitory interneurons. This synchronized discharge of interneurons in turn elicited large-amplitude inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal and granule cells. Excitatory synaptic responses mediated by GABAA receptors may thus provide a mechanism for the recruitment of GABAergic interneurons through their recurrent connections.", 
    "64": "A procedure for determining esmolol concentrations in blood is described. Dichloromethane was used to extract esmolol from the blood and to inhibit the activity of blood esterases. Blood esmolol concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using 3-methoxy-O-demethylencainide as the internal standard. The limit of detection of this assay was 5 ng/ml. The relationship between the peak-height ratio of esmolol and the internal standard was linear in the concentration ranges 10-30,000 ng/ml. The mean absolute and relative recoveries of esmolol from blood were 84 and 89%, with coefficients of variation less than 3%. This method has been used in our laboratory for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies.", 
    "65": "To study the effect of drug resistance on the response of stage IV astrocytomas to interferon, a human glioblastoma multiforme cell line, GBM-18, was transfected with an expression-vector plasmid containing a human multidrug resistance (MDR) gene (pHaMDR1/A), and clones surviving in colchicine were isolated. GBM-18 multidrug-resistant subclones displayed cross-resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents, including vincristine, doxorubicin, and dactinomycin. The multidrug-resistant phenotype was reversible when GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells were cultured in colchicine and the calcium-channel blocker verapamil. The level of the MDR1 gene (also known as PGY1) message was increased in GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells selected for increased resistance to colchicine, and this effect was not correlated with an amplification of the MDR1 gene. In both parental GBM-18 and GBM-18 multidrug-resistant cells, growth was suppressed to a greater degree when cultures were treated with the combination of fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and immune interferon (IFN-gamma). Parental cells and multidrug-resistant subclones varied in their de novo and/or interferon-modulated expression of HLA class I and class II antigens, a high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). Of the antigens tested, ICAM-1 and HLA class I antigens were the most sensitive to enhanced expression induced by IFN-beta and IFN-gamma when used alone or in combination. The results of the present study indicate that multidrug-resistant human glioblastoma multiforme cells retain their increased sensitivity to the antiproliferative activity of the combination of IFN-beta plus IFN-gamma, and differences in antigenic phenotype are apparent in independent multidrug-resistant glioblastoma multiforme clones.", 
    "66": "The ionic mechanisms underlying concentration-related alterations in the action potential configuration caused by ATP were studied using preparations of the guinea-pig vas deferens voltage-clamped by a double sucrose gap method. Under current-clamp conditions, ATP at concentration of 1.6 microM enhanced the rates of rise and of repolarisation of the action potential whereas at concentration of 1.6 mM it reduced both rates. Under voltage-clamp conditions, lower concentrations increased the maximum inward Ca current without altering kinetics or reversal potential. Higher concentrations reduced the maximum inward Ca current with slowing of rates of activations and inactivation, but also caused a negative shift in reversal potential without affecting conductance. These results suggest that a low ATP concentration activates the voltage-dependent Ca current channels and that the action of a high ATP concentration is related to the internal Ca ion concentration.", 
    "67": "The serotonin (5-HT)1A agonist, LY 165,163 (1-[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine) , also known as PAPP, has been suggested to exert effects via an interaction with dopamine receptors. Thus, in this study, we examined its ability to induce rotation in rats sustaining unilateral 6-hydroxy-dopamine lesions of the substantia nigra, an in vivo model of dopaminergic activity. In analogy to the direct dopamine (mixed D1/D2) agonist, apomorphine, (0.01-0.63 mg/kg), LY 165,163 (0.16-10.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently elicited robust and sustained contralateral rotation. Its maximal effect was comparable to that of apomorphine and its duration of action more extended. Rotation elicited by LY 165,163 (10.0 mg/kg) was resistant to the 5-HT1A antagonist, (-)-alprenolol. It was also unaffected by the selective D1 antagonist, SCH 23390 (R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5,tetrahydro-1H-3-be nza zepine) (2.5 mg/kg) or the selective D2 antagonist, raclopride (10.0 mg/kg) when each was administered alone. However, upon joint administration they clearly diminished the effect of LY 165,163. The dopamine antagonist, haloperidol (D2 greater than D1) also reduced the action of LY 165,163. This profile of partial antagonism by mixed D1 and D2 receptor blockade has been reported previously for apomorphine and contrasts to that seen with selective D1 or D2 agonists, the actions of which are completely blocked by D1 or D2 antagonists, respectively. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that LY 165,163 exerts pronounced rotation in nigral-lesioned rats: this reflects a mixed D1/D2 action rather than an activation of 5-HT1A sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "The effects of atenolol, nifedipine, and their combination on gas exchange and exercise tolerance were studied in 27 patients with effort angina and normal global ventricular function in an open-label and randomized cross-over trial. Symptom-limited semi-supine exercise tests using a ramp protocol (20 W/min) with simultaneous breath-by-breath analysis of gas exchange were carried out after a 4-day wash-out period and after consecutive 2-week treatment periods with atenolol (50 mg b.i.d.), slow-release nifedipine (20 mg b.i.d.), and their combination (b.i.d.). Exercise tolerance was not significantly higher with atenolol than with nifedipine [118(24) vs 113(23) W]. Combination therapy [120(23) W] was more effective than monotherapy with nifedipine (p less than 0.05) but produced no further increase in exercise tolerance over atenolol monotherapy. Maximum oxygen uptake was not significantly different among the treatments. In the range of light to moderate exercise, the slope of the VO2-workload regression line expressed as ml.min-1.W-1 was lower with atenolol than with nifedipine [8.64(1.59) vs 10.28(1.74), p less than 0.005] and intermediate with combination therapy [9.99(1.83)]. The intercept on the VO2 axis was higher with atenolol than with nifedipine [366(111) vs 299(113) ml.min-1, p less than 0.05]. A similar pattern of results was seen when the drug effects on the slope of the VCO2-workload relation were analyzed.

    "69": "Withdrawal of beta-blocker therapy has been associated with the development of adrenergic hypersensitivity and adverse clinical effects in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. The aim of this study was to establish the occurrence and clinical significance of adrenergic hypersensitivity after abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockade in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Beta-adrenergic sensitivity was measured using the isoprenaline chronotropic dose25. Symptom assessment chronotropic dose25 calculation, bicycle exercise, echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed while the patient received beta-blocker therapy and repeated on days 2, 4, 6, 8 (acute withdrawal period) and on day 21 after abrupt withdrawal. The study was terminated after 7 patients had been studied because all patients experienced a marked deterioration in symptoms and several clinical events had occurred. The chronotropic dose25 (mean +/- standard deviation) demonstrated beta 1-adrenergic hypersensitivity with a minimal value of 1.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms during the acute withdrawal period compared with 3.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms on day 21 (p = 0.003). Heart rates during rest and exercise showed an overshoot increase during the acute withdrawal period. The maximal 24-hour ventricular ectopic count was higher during the acute withdrawal period than during day 21 (p = 0.04). Of 3 patients with inducible outflow tract gradients, 2 developed resting gradients greater than 30 mm Hg during the acute withdrawal period. There was an increase in peak late filling velocity of mitral inflow after beta-blocker withdrawal. In conclusion, transient beta-adrenergic hypersensitivity occurs after beta-blocker withdrawal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is associated with significant physiologic changes and adverse clinical consequences.",

Intraocular pressure was not markedly changed in placebo-treated patients. Outflow facility was unaltered two hours after instillation of metipranolol at study week 2 compared to baseline measurement. Aqueous humor flow rates were reduced (P = .02) 20% after 0.6% or 0.3% metipranolol instillation and were unchanged after placebo administration compared to baseline measurement. Mean systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate were not markedly altered. Metipranolol reduces intraocular pressure by suppressing aqueous humor flow rates.", 
    "71": "Increasing evidence indicates that long-term use of topically administered medications can induce changes in the conjunctiva and ocular surface. We used the technique of conjunctival impression cytology to evaluate the conjunctival changes that develop with long-term use of topically administered antiglaucoma medications. Patients with glaucoma who were on a stable regimen of one, two, or three topically administered medications were recruited for study; glaucoma suspects who were not using topically administered medications served as controls. Eyes with clinical or historical evidence of external eye disease or conjunctival surgery were excluded. Impression cytology specimens, collected from the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva, were coded and subsequently graded by a masked observer. We examined specimens from 72 eyes by using this technique. Aggregate scores for the bulbar conjunctiva were compiled, using a previously described grading system with a range of 0 (normal) to 3 (diffuse, severe metaplasia). The results show statistically significant degrees of conjunctival metaplasia associated with the number of glaucoma medications used. These results suggest that the long-term use of antiglaucoma medications induces changes in the conjunctival surface. These changes may be related to the medications themselves, the preservatives in the commercial preparations, or the duration of topical treatment. The clinical relevance of these changes remains unknown.", 
    "72": "The beta 2-adrenergic transmembrane signal transduction was investigated in malignant B-cells from 15 patients with low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as compared with normal lymphocytes of seven healthy adults. The number of beta 2-adrenoceptors and the response of adenylate cyclase (AC) to isoproterenol were slightly decreased in lymphoma cells. The responsiveness of AC to forskolin was 8-fold lower in lymphoma cells, whereas the response to cholera toxin showed no difference. These findings demonstrate an impairment of the beta 2-adrenergic signal transduction in low grade lymphoma cells that particularly affects the function of AC. The comparison with forskolin resistant mutants of an adrenocortical tumor cell line, Y1 (Schimmer et al., J Biol Chem 262: 15521-15526, 1987), suggests that the availability of functional active alpha subunits of stimulatory G proteins (Gs) might be reduced in human B-cell lymphoma, although other mechanisms known to inhibit the AC activity might be involved.",

Increases in ERP produced by the four class III agents at 37 degrees C were significantly greater at a pacing frequency of 1 Hz (range of 70.0 +/- 7.6 to 102.0 +/- 2.3 ms) than at 3 Hz (range of 18.3 +/- 4.4 to 31.BBB/- 4.8 ms).

Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, alpha- and beta-blockers, and beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity are lipid neutral. alpha 1-Antagonists (e.g., terazosin and prazosin) lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and improve total cholesterol/HDL ratios. Observational epidemiologic studies indicate that the lipid effects of antihypertensive agents are large enough to account for substantial differences in the predicted incidence of coronary heart disease. Combination therapy with the alpha 1-antagonist terazosin plus either thiazides or beta-blockers also ameliorates the adverse lipid effects of these agents used alone. A reasonable approach to managing the lipid problems often associated with hypertension is to advise a cholesterol-lowering, low-sodium diet and weight reduction and to select drugs that alone or in combination do not adversely affect lipid profiles.", 
    "76": "A single population of alpha 2 adrenoceptors was characterized in intact B lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) by binding and saturation studies with 3H labelled yohimbine and by competition studies with alpha adrenergic antagonists. While the affinity of B-CLL alpha 2 adrenoceptors was low (KD: 9.81 nM-20.98 nM), each cell expressed a large number of receptors. No binding of the alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin was observed and the binding properties of beta adrenergic receptors (assayed with 3H-labelled dihydroalprenolol), were similar to those described for normal lymphocytes. Reaction of B-CLL with the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol raised the levels of cAMP in 11/13 patients tested, and in 8 of these, incubation with the alpha 2 adrenergic agonist clonidine prevented the effect and reduced the basal cAMP levels. The presence of active alpha 2 adrenoceptors on B-CLL lymphocytes may be involved in the regulation of metabolic pathways that affect cell functions and favor neoplastic growth.", 
    "77": "UD-CG-212 CL is a metabolite of pimobendan (UD-CG-115 BS), a non-glycosidic, non-adrenergic positive inotropic agent. In the present study we investigated the effect of UD-CG-212 CL on cat papillary muscles in the presence or absence of an intact endocardial endothelium. The endocardium was damaged by a very short detergent treatment. We demonstrated that, in muscles with an intact endocardial endothelium, UD-CG-212 CL induced a moderate, but significant inotropic effect resembling the changes induced by adrenoceptor agonists. Addition of an alpha- and or beta-blocker reduced this positive inotropic effect. The effect induced by UD-CG-212 CL, was completely abolished after the endocardial endothelium was damaged. We conclude that the endocardium played a modulatory role in the action of UD-CG-212 CL through the release of various factors with inotropic activity.", 
    "78": "Splanchnic and systemic haemodynamics were measured in 24 patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices and no previous bleeding. The patients were randomized either to long-term treatment with propranolol (14 patients) or no active treatment (controls, 10 patients). Catheterization was performed again 1 year after randomization. After 1 year of treatment the hepatic venous pressure gradient had decreased in both the propranolol and control group (-16% versus -24% (NS), respectively). Hepatic blood flow decreased substantially in both groups but significantly more in the propranolol group (-39% versus -17% (p less than 0.05), respectively). Azygos blood flow was significantly reduced after 1 year in the propranolol group (-47%, n = 5 (p less than 0.05)), and no obvious effect was observed in the control group (-2%, n = 4). The cardiac index decreased significantly in the propranolol group but not in the control group (-20% versus -1% (p less than 0.05), respectively). Our results demonstrate that the splanchnic hyperdynamic condition observed in cirrhosis is in some of the patients partly reversible without pharmacologic treatment. No additional effect of propranolol was observed on portal pressure after 1 year of treatment with propranolol, whereas a decrease in azygos blood flow was observed only in the propranolol group. The beneficial effect of propranolol on the risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices may, therefore, mostly be due to a selective decrease in collateral blood flow and thereby variceal blood flow.", 
    "79": "Quantitative bronchial challenge tests with methacholine and propranolol were performed in volunteers with bronchial asthma (n = 17) and in normal controls (n = 13), in order to test the earlier assumption that propranolol might be more useful to assess nonspecific bronchial responsiveness in bronchial asthma. The investigations were performed in random order, with a minimum interval of 24-hours. The aerosol was administered by a dosimeter (APS, Jaeger), using doubling concentrations, with a maximum of 25 mg/ml (2.5%), the lowest concentrations being 0.26 mg/ml (propranolol) and 0.03 mg/ml (methacholine), respectively. The provocation dose at a decrease in sGaw of 50% (PD50) was calculated from the dose-response curve. While methacholine induced an airways obstruction sufficient to calculate a PD50 in 29/30 subjects, propranolol was similarly effective in only 19/30 cases the rank correlation coefficient was 0.4368 (p less than 0.025). At a methacholine-PD50 greater than 0.2 mg(= concentration greater than 1 mg/ml) no propranolol-PD50 could be determined. In accordance with the literature, in the asthmatic subgroup the PD50sGaw [geometric means] were 25 (2.7-109.6) micrograms for methacholine, and 900 (75.9-3331) micrograms for propranolol, or 0.13 mumol and 3.46 mumol, respectively. The inhalation of propranolol in the highest possible concentration (limited solubility) induced airways obstruction only in subjects with asthmatic hyper-responsiveness. A similar distinction between asthmatic and normal subjects is possible by methacholine using a threshold concentration (in this study: cumulative PD50sGaw 0.2 mg or provocation concentration 1 mg/ml). Moreover, methacholine allows a determination of minor degrees of hyperresponsiveness, in mild airways obstruction or normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "Dilevalol is a vasodilating beta-blocker with proven antihypertensive activity. In this study, 28 patients with mild-to-moderate uncomplicated hypertension underwent 2 submaximal exercise tests, each consisting of progressive steps of 20 watts for 2 minutes or up to 85% theoretical maximum heart rate. Five minutes after the first test, patients received either placebo or dilevalol 200 mg, 400 mg or 600 mg. The second exercise test was performed 3 hours later. Diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and norepinephrine plasma levels were assessed before and after exercise. Dilevalol at all doses caused a significant decrease in heart rate and blood pressure both at rest and during exercise, compared to placebo. Dilevalol 600 mg had a greater effect on diastolic blood pressure than dilevalol 200 mg and 400 mg. Administration of dilevalol 200 mg and 400 mg enabled 42% of patients to increase their maximal exercise level by 20 to 60 watts. Dilevalol increased plasma norepinephrine levels at the 100 watts exercise levels from 5.1 +/- 4.0 nmol/l to 7.6 +/- 4.3 nmol/l (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects were observed during dilevalol treatment. This study shows that dilevalol is an effective antihypertensive agent that blunts heart rate and blood pressure risings during exercise.", 
    "81": "Because most patients with mild to moderate hypertension will not suffer a cardiovascular event due to elevated blood pressure, the presence of other risk factors must be assessed. Many of these are alterable with nondrug therapies, which cost little and carry no risks if applied sensibly. Drug therapies have costs, discomforts, and risks and should be used only for those at high risk or those who fail to respond adequately to nondrug therapies. When drug therapy is necessary, start with low doses and aim for a slow reduction of blood pressure, avoiding hypoperfusion and reducing as many risk factors as possible. Alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers may avoid metabolic risks associated with high-dose diuretic and beta-blocker therapy. The establishment of therapeutic goals, individualized assessment of status, and a conservative approach to treatment are the basis for optimal management of patients with hypertension.", 
    "82": "The fast and slow components of the response to noradrenaline in rat aorta were studied to assess their relative contribution to the total mechanical response. The fast component, the magnitude of which varied with the concentration of noradrenaline in a dose-dependent manner, was shown to be dependent on release of calcium from intracellular stores. In calcium-free medium with ethylene glycol bis-(beta-aminoethylether) N,N,N',N-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) a noradrenaline challenge (1 microM) produced a transient increase in force which faded in about 10 mins. Addition of calcium at this point produces a slow component of similar amplitude to the total response to noradrenaline. Recycling of calcium through the intracellular store does not appear to play an important role under these experimental conditions, since the presence of noradrenaline in the bath prevented its refilling. It is concluded that extracellular calcium by itself (ie, the slow component) can account for the total contractile response to noradrenaline in rat aorta.", 
    "83": "The authors evaluated the effect of Dilevalol infusion on blood pressure, heart rate, central hemodynamics, and rheologic parameters in hospitalized inpatients affected with mild or moderate hypertension. After a dose-finding phase and a washout period of one week, 10 patients aged fifty to seventy-two-years (median 61.5) were given either a single dose of Dilevalol 60 mg or placebo, and seven days later they underwent the other treatment, according to a single-blind, crossover design. Central hemodynamic measurements were performed by means of M-mode echocardiography, and hemorheologic parameters were evaluated by means of strain-gauge plethysmography. The maximal increase in lower extremity flow at rest had been obtained with the infusion of 60 mg Dilevalol during dose-finding, and so this dose was chosen for the second part of the study. The infusion of Dilevalol significantly increased rest flow and decreased blood viscosity, but the changes in central, parameters were not considered clinically relevant, although statistically significant. Blood pressure decreased without significant changes in heart rate. Thus, the acute administration of Dilevalol reduced blood pressure, without affecting heart rate and central hemodynamics, confirming the vasodilating effect of the drug. A significant improvement was also shown on blood viscosity in these hypertensive patients.", 
    "84": "Forty-nine patients, with ages ranging from eighteen to seventy years and with mild to moderate primary hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure of greater than or equal to 95 mmgH and less than or equal to 115 mmHg) were randomized into a twenty-one-week, double-blind, prospective study to determine the effects of monotherapy of nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) versus atenolol on serum lipids, lipid subfractions, apolipoproteins, (apo), and blood pressure (BP). Nifedipine GITS and atenolol significantly reduced blood pressure, but nifedipine GITS reduced sitting and standing systolic BP significantly more than atenolol (p = .001). Sitting and standing heart rate decreased significantly (p = 0.001) during atenolol therapy but did not change significantly during nifedipine GITS therapy. Atenolol increased weight (mean change + 2.2 lb; p = 0.011), but nifedipine GITS decreased weight (mean change - 2.4 lb; p = 0.07). Nifedipine GITS had a more favorable effect on the lipid profile. High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL2 subfractions were increased significantly (p = .001) as were apo A1 (p = 0.037) and apo A2 (p = 0.025). Nifedipine GITS increased HDL3 (NS), reduced triglycerides (TG) (NS), and had no significant effect on total cholesterol (TC) low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apo B. Atenolol significantly increased serum total cholesterol (p = 0.039) and HDL-C and HDL2 (p = 0.049 and 0.048 respectively). Atenolol increased TG (NS) and apo B (NS) with little change in apo A1 and apo A2. It is concluded that nifedipine GITS had equal or better antihypertensive efficacy than atenolol and had a more favorable effect on the lipid profile. These effects may offer advantages in reducing CHD risk.", 
    "85": "A case of refractory hypotension following propranolol overdose is reported. Management included isoprenaline, glucagon and extracorporeal circulatory support using femoral vein-femoral artery bypass. The unreliability of neurological observations, especially unreactive pupils, in the presence of drug overdose is reiterated.", 
    "86": "The effect of propranolol was studied on 23 dental phobics in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving actual dental treatment. The subjects were selected because they showed high physiological reactivity in the dental situation. Twelve subjects received the test drug and 11 subjects received the placebo at individualized doses of either 80 or 120 mg. A significant difference in self-reported anxiety at the injection phase of treatment and less overall pain intensity and aversiveness were observed for the propranolol as compared with the placebo group. No differences were detected for behavior ratings. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may have utility for reducing anxiety in individuals fearful of dental treatment.", 
    "87": "The ability of continuous infusions of opioids to control hypertension at the end of neurosurgical procedures without compromising prompt emergence was studied in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumours. Four infusion regimens were compared in a randomized double-blind fashion; three of alfentanil and one of fentanyl. Low-dose alfentanil was administered to nine patients (35.1 micrograms.kg-1 then a continuous infusion of 16.2 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1); mid-dose alfentanil to eight patients (70.2 micrograms.kg-1 then 32.4 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1); high-dose alfentanil to eight patients (105.3 micrograms.kg-1 then 48.6 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1). Eight additional patients were given fentanyl (8.3 micrograms.kg-1 then 1.6 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1). Using published values for the pharmacokinetic variables of alfentanil and fentanyl, modelling predicted stable concentrations of 60, 120, 180 ng.ml-1 for the alfentanil infusion regimens respectively and 2 ng.ml-1 with the fentanyl regimen. Maintenance anaesthesia comprised the opioid infusion, 50% N2O in O2 and isoflurane titrated to control mean arterial pressure (MAP) within 20% of ward MAP. Isoflurane was discontinued after closure of the dura. Nitrous oxide was discontinued at the same time as reversal of neuromuscular blockade. The opioid infusion was discontinued with closure of the galea. A greater time-averaged isoflurane concentration was required to control MAP within the prescribed limits in the low alfentanil group (ANOVA; P less than 0.05). The PaCO2 at two, five and 30 min after extubation were not different among groups. The times from discontinuing N2O to eye opening and tracheal extubation were not different. The time to follow commands was longer in the low alfentanil group (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "The effectiveness of propranolol, a nonsedating anxiolytic premedication, was studied by monitoring preoperative anxiety and postoperative recovery of cognitive function in 92 healthy ASA physical status I females aged 15-42 yr undergoing outpatient dilatation and curettage (D&C) for therapeutic abortion. In a randomized double-blind design, patients received one of the following oral medications 1-1.5 hr preoperatively: (1) diazepam 10 mg (n = 31); (2) propranolol 80 mg (n = 31); (3) placebo (n = 30). Anxiety throughout the hospital stay was monitored using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Postoperative cognitive recovery was assessed using the digit span and Trieger tests. STAI anxiety levels were recorded on admission to hospital, immediately before entering the operating room, and two hours postoperatively. There was no difference among the anxiolytic properties of the three medications and all three patient groups showed a significant decrease in anxiety levels after administration of the medication. Tests of cognitive function after anaesthesia showed the fastest return to baseline status in patients receiving propranolol, possibly because beta adrenergic blockade blunted the autonomic signs of light anaesthesia and less anaesthetic was administered. None of the study premedications was demonstrated to have an anxiolytic advantage, but propranolol did offer a faster return of cognitive function in the postoperative period.", 
    "89": "We have studied the effect of labetalol on anaesthetic requirements, cardiac and humoral responses in 16 healthy women during elective abdominal surgery. The experimental group (n = 8) received increments of i.v. labetalol 0.15-0.3 mg kg-1 to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 15% from values obtained before anaesthesia. All patients received thiopentone 6 mg kg-1 and anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and nitrous oxide. In the placebo group, tracheal intubation provoked a 33% increase in heart rate (HR) and a 52% increase in MAP (P less than 0.001 vs baseline for both). In contrast, pretreatment with labetalol resulted in a 7.3% increase in HR and a 21.3% increase in MAP (P less than 0.05 vs baseline for MAP). Two patients treated with labetalol had a reduction in MAP to 50-60 mm Hg during surgery. After tracheal extubation, the labetalol group had a significantly slower HR than the placebo group (P less than 0.05). The cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation was associated with an increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration in both groups. Labetalol did not affect isoflurane requirements, plasma concentrations of adrenaline, cortisol and aldosterone or arterial PO2, but prevented the decrease in plasma concentration of potassium which occurred in placebo treated patients (P less than 0.05) in early recovery. We conclude that preanaesthetic administration of labetalol attenuated the perioperative hypertensive and tachycardic responses, but was accompanied by intraoperative hypotension when given in doses greater than 0.5 mg kg-1, despite an increase in plasma noradrenaline concentrations.", 
    "90": "The effects of the ATP-sensitive K(+)-channel blocker glibenclamide on the cardiovascular responses to adenosine in dogs were determined. Adenosine (0.01-20 mumol/kg iv) caused coronary vasodilatation, arterial hypotension, and bradycardia in dogs with either combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockade or with bilateral cervical vagotomy plus beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The 50% effective dose for adenosine-induced coronary dilatation was increased from 0.13 +/- 0.04 mumol/kg in the control state to 1.1 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg after 2 mg/kg of glibenclamide (P less than 0.001). Adenosine at 5 mumol/kg reduced heart rate by 19 +/- 5% from a baseline of 158 +/- 6 beats/min in five anesthetized dogs. After glibenclamide (10 mg/kg), this dose of adenosine failed to cause a significant change in heart rate. The arterial hypotensive effects of adenosine were also attenuated by glibenclamide. Thus glibenclamide inhibited adenosine-induced bradycardia, hypotension, and coronary dilatation. On the other hand, glibenclamide did not affect the reductions in heart rate caused by vagus nerve stimulation. The mechanism of this adenosine antagonism is not known but, in the case of bradycardia, it does not appear to involve any of the steps shared in common by both adenosine-induced and vagal responses of the sinoatrial node.", 
    "91": "A total of 5778 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomized to early intravenous metoprolol followed by oral treatment for 15 d, or to placebo. Thereafter, the two groups were treated similarly. During a 1-year follow-up period the mortality in patients who were randomized to early metoprolol was 10.6% compared to 10.7% for placebo (P greater than 0.2). Among patients with a higher risk of death, the tendency towards a reduced mortality in the metoprolol group that was observed after 15 d remained similar after 1 year. It is concluded that early intervention with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction did not improve the long-term prognosis compared to placebo treatment."
