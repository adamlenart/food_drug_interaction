In stimulation of supraoptic and lateral hypothalamic nuclei the hepatic O2 consumption changed insignificantly. The hypothalamic effects on the liver tissue respiration was blocked by obsidan (propranolol) but not by atropine. A correlation exists between shifts of the O2 consumption rate and those of temperature in the liver. The data suggest that hypothalamus can modify the liver oxidative metabolism through the sympathetic nervous system and beta-adrenergic receptors of the hepatocytes and redistribute the energy of this metabolism between processes of thermogenesis and endothermic reactions in the liver.", 
    "1": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocker sotalol has been shown to possess class III antiarrhythmic action. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that class III antiarrhythmic action and positive inotropy may be linked. Since d,l-sotalol has previously been reported to have variable inotropic effect, we studied direct effects of the d- and l-stereoisomer of sotalol on refractoriness and inotropy of isolated rat atria at different strengths of electrical stimulation. Both the d- and l-stereoisomer of sotalol (7.5 x 10(-5) M) increased the effective refractory period, and to the same extent. However, d-sotalol increased isometric contractile force by 10%, while l-sotalol had no significant effect, when the atria were stimulated at close to threshold values (10 +/- 1 mA). Probably due to release of noradrenaline within the myocardium, contractile force increased when the atria were stimulated at suprathreshold values (40 mA). At suprathreshold stimulation, however, d-sotalol induced a 10% decrease and l-sotalol a 20% decrease, in contractile force. In conclusion, the class III antiarrhythmic action of sotalol is linked with positive inotropy. In the presence of neurotransmitter release, negative inotropic effect of d- and in particular l-sotalol, may occur due to beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity.", 
    "2": "1. Plasma drug concentrations, and heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise at a predetermined load were examined in twelve hypertensive patients following single and repeated doses of oxprenolol administered once daily as oral osmotic drug delivery systems (10/170 and 16/260 oxprenolol OROS). 2. Plasma oxprenolol concentration profiles after each preparation were consistent with the criteria for sustained drug release. Levels immediately after exercise were significantly higher than those prior to exercise (P less than 0.001), but differences were slight. 3. Both OROS drug forms reduced exercise heart rate for 24 h after single and repeated doses; effects were greater for 16/260 OROS than for 10/170 OROS. Significant reductions in post-exercise systolic BP were observed 24 h after drug administration and after repeated doses there was little difference between the preparations. Effects on diastolic BP after exercise were slight. 4. The relationship between plasma oxprenolol concentrations and exercise heart rates fitted an exponential mathematical model which makes allowance for inter-individual variability. No such kinetic-dynamic relationship could be defined for post-exercise systolic or diastolic BP.", 
    "3": "1. To clarify whether the bradycardic agent UL-FS 49 exhibits a positive inotropic effect even in the absence of improvement in regional myocardial function of an underperfused myocardial area, this study was undertaken in dogs with unimpaired coronary flow. 2. We also investigated the haemodynamic and functional effects of the negative chronotropic and inotropic beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol. 3. UL-FS 49 did not depress total or regional myocardial performance. Moreover, an increase in positive left ventricular dp/dt max at rest suggests a positive inotropic effect of UL-FS 49. 4. Propranolol, in contrast to UL-FS 49, led to a marked reduction in positive dp/dt max, stroke volume and systolic wall thickening at rest and during exercise. Additionally, propranolol decreased the exercise values of cardiac output, left ventricular work and left ventricular power to a far greater extent than UL-FS 49. 5. In contrast to propranolol, the selective bradycardic agent UL-FS 49 did not decrease total or regional ventricular performance and caused less reduction in cardiodynamic parameters during exercise. 6. These results suggest that patients with moderate coronary insufficiency or patients with coronary vessel disease and mild left ventricular failure may attain a higher exercise limit under selective bradycardia with UL-FS 49 in comparison to that possible with a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, such as propranolol.", 
    "4": "1. The potentiating effects of racemic 4-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (PI-OH), cocaine, desipramine and nomifensine on the concentration-response curves of the rat anococcygeus muscle to noradrenaline (NA) and field stimulation were examined. 2. PI-OH and cocaine concentration-dependently potentiated the responses of anococcygeus muscle to NA and field stimulation, but the activity of PI-OH was stronger than that of cocaine on both responses. 3. At high concentrations the potentiating activities of desipramine and nomifensine were less, a fact that was explained by their postsynaptic inhibitory properties; the actions of nomifensine and desipramine as antagonists against NA were competitive and non-competitive, respectively. 4. It is concluded that PI-OH may be an ideal potentiator of the response to NA in adrenergically-innervated tissues because it has no side effects such as postsynaptic inhibition.", 
    "5": "A genetically determined impairment in the ability to oxidase sparteine and debrisoquine also affects the oxidation of several other drugs. This impairment in oxidation may result in accumulation of the associated drugs and in an increased susceptibility to adverse reactions from these drugs. Dunedin houses the New Zealand national centre for the collation and study of adverse drug reactions. Included among the reporting schemes is an intensified monitoring system for newly released drugs, in which physicians report all clinical events occurring during treatment with the drugs under surveillance. The centre thus has available extensive records of names and addresses of prescribers and patients who have been reported as experiencing an adverse event while receiving drug therapy. We investigated the association between genetically poor oxidation of sparteine and adverse reactions to drugs selected as possibly sharing the sparteine/debrisoquine oxidation pathway; these included perhexiline, metoprolol, debrisoquine, piroxicam, mianserin and nifedipine. A kit containing instructions, a sparteine capsule and a container for urine collection was sent to physicians who reported adverse reactions or events to one of the above drugs for forwarding to the patient. It appeared possible, after assays of returned urine for sparteine and its metabolites, that adverse reactions to nifedipine were associated with genetically poor oxidation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "A high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with internal analogue standardization for the determination of 5-hydroxypropafenone in plasma is described. The method comprises extraction from plasma at pH 9 with diethyl-ether and quantification after HPLC separation using a reverse phase by means of electrochemical (reductive) detection after electrochemical preoxidation. When using 1 ml plasma the lower limit of detection is 0.5 ng/ml. Under routine conditions the limit of determination is estimated to be lower than 2 ng/ml. The variation coefficients of duplicates drop from about 10% in the range of the determination limit to about 3% at 5 ng/ml and above. The determination of 5-hydroxypropafenone is not impaired by other known metabolites of propafenone.", 
    "7": "This study describes a method that utilizes a combination of the Millar transducer and Columbus thermistor in the conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rat and that permits simultaneous evaluation of the effects of cardiovascular agents on ventricular performance and systemic hemodynamics. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP, mmHg) and LV dp/dt (mmHg/sec) were measured with a Millar transducer inserted into the left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats under ether anesthesia. Cardiac output (CO, ml/min) was measured by thermodilution (Columbus Instruments) with a thermocouple in the thoracic aorta via the femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg) was measured via a catheter in the other femoral artery. All cardiovascular parameters measured were shown to attain a steady state within 3 hr after cessation of ether administration. Infusion of the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol increased LV max dP/dt, heart rate (HR), and CO, and decreased arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistance. Administration of propranolol resulted in decreased HR, LV dP/dt and CO. The results show that this model was stable over an extended period of time and was responsive to standard inotropic agents. Thus, the combined use of the Millar transducer and the Columbus thermistor appears suitable for the assessment of acute pharmacological interventions on cardiovascular function in the conscious rat.", 
    "8": "Acebutolol, a beta-1 selective beta blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity has been shown to be an effective agent in chronic angina pectoris therapy, with twice or three times daily dosing. The long-term effects of 400 mg of acebutolol given only once a day versus placebo on exercise hemodynamics, ST segment depression, and rate pressure product were studied. Eleven patients (mean age, 60 +/- 12 years) with hypertension and chronic angina pectoris were enrolled. Resting heart rate was not significantly altered after therapy, (80 vs 72 bpm). Objective measurements from exercise treadmill tests showed significant reduction in peak heart rate from 130 to 103 bpm, systolic blood pressure from 197 to 167 mm Hg, rate pressure product (from 25 to 18 bpm-mm Hg X 1000), and ST depression in patients receiving acebutolol compared with those receiving placebo. No significant adverse effects were reported. These data indicate that acebutolol may be efficacious as once daily therapy for chronic stable angina pectoris.", 
    "9": "To assess the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation in cardiovascular conditioning we examined the effects of a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, in mongrel dogs during an 8-wk treadmill-training program. Seven dogs were trained without a drug (NP), six were trained on propranolol 10 mg.kg-1.day-1 (P), and five served as caged controls (C). Effective beta-adrenergic blockade was documented by a decrease in peak exercise heart rate of 54 +/- 11 (SE) beats/min (P less than 0.05) and a one-log magnitude of increase in the isoproterenol-heart rate dose-response curve. Testing was performed before drug treatment or training and again after training without the drug for 5 days. Submaximal exercise heart rate decreased similarly in both NP and P (-26 +/- 4 NP vs. -25 +/- 9 beats/min P, P less than 0.05 for both) but peak heart rate decreased only with NP (-33 +/- 9 beats/min, P less than 0.05). Treadmill exercise time increased similarly in both groups: 3.4 +/- 0.6 min in NP and 3.0 +/- 0.2 min in P (both P less than 0.05). Blood volume also increased after training in both groups: 605 +/- 250 ml (26%) in NP and 377 +/- 140 ml (17%) in P (both P less than 0.05). Submaximal exercise arterial lactates were reduced similarly in both groups but peak exercise lactate was reduced more in NP (-1.4 +/- 0.3 NP vs -0.3 +/- 0.12 mmol/l P, P less than 0.05). Lactate threshold increased in both groups but the increase was greater in NP (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Thirty healthy volunteers were treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking doses of long-acting propranolol for at least 28 days before being randomized to continue propranolol treatment, receive identical placebo under double-blind conditions, or discontinue all treatment. No evidence of a central nervous withdrawal syndrome occurred during the next 28 days as assessed by changes in psychomotor tests, rating scales, visual analogue scales, tremor recordings and melatonin excretion. Three subjects in the placebo withdrawal group but none in the propranolol group complained of insomnia for up to 14 days of the withdrawal period.", 
    "11": "To evaluate the roles for catecholamines in angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced vasopressin (AVP) release, we examined in conscious rats the effects of intraventricular (ivt) administrations of catecholamine antagonists on plasma AVP responses to ivt applications of its agonists and ANG II. Plasma AVP was determined by RIA using trunk blood collected after decapitation. Dopamine (0.15 mumol), phenylephrine (an alpha-adrenergic agonist, 0.15 mumol) or ANG II (48.2 pmol) augmented plasma AVP 90 sec after the injection, whereas after isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic agonist, 0.15 mumol) plasma AVP was unaffected. The plasma AVP responses to both dopamine and ANG II were significantly (P less than 0.01) inhibited by haloperidol (a dopamine blocker, 0.15 mumol) given 10 min before administration of these agents. Pre-administration of phenoxybenzamine (an alpha antagonist, 0.15 mumol) which was confirmed to abolish the effect of phenylephrine, or propranolol (a beta antagonist, 0.15 mumol) did not block the effect of ANG II. Administration of haloperidol, phenoxybenzamine or propranolol alone was without effect on plasma AVP level. On the basis of these results, we concluded that ANG II-induced AVP secretion may be mediated and/or modulated by dopamine.", 
    "12": "The use of nisoldipine (10-20 mg b.i.d.) was evaluated as a replacement therapy for long-acting nifedipine (40-120 mg/day) in 21 patients with severe hypertension, who were resistant to or intolerant of nifedipine. Except for one patient with specific contraindications, all participants received an individually determined constant dose of beta blocker throughout the 8-month study. Results indicated a significant decrease in blood pressure after four weeks of treatment with nisoldipine (173 +/- 5/98 +/- 4 to 156 +/- 3/91 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.05) without an associated change in pulse rate in 19 patients; only 5 of the 21 patients showed no further benefit from nisoldipine. No significant biochemical changes were noted in any of the patients during the study. In three patients, leg edema that had developed as a consequence of previous nifedipine therapy resolved completely following nisoldipine administration. Two patients withdrew from the study before term because of headaches and palpitations. An additional two patients suffered headaches, but tolerated the drug and continued the study. One patient suffered from polyuria. Nisoldipine appears to be an effective substitute treatment for nifedipine in severely hypertensive patients sensitive or resistant to nifedipine.", 
    "13": "Lysosomotropic amines can raise the acidic internal pH of the neutrophil lysosome and inhibit neutrophil function. Because pH and calcium regulation are intimately connected in various types of excitable cells, we studied the effects of several lysosomotropic weak bases on neutrophil calcium homeostasis. Base-treated cells had normal to minimally elevated resting cytosol free calcium, but weak bases produced significant release of calcium from organelles when this release was directly measured in permeabilized cells, even after depletion of inositol-triphosphate-sensitive stores. Collapse of transmembrane pH gradients with monensin similarly released organelle calcium. The initial cytosol calcium response to f-met-leu-phe was enhanced by some of the lysosomotropic amines but the calcium rise was more transient in base-treated cells than in control samples. These findings suggest that existence of an acidic intracellular compartment, such as the lysosome, is important to normal calcium homeostasis in the neutrophil and that pH sensitivity and inositol triphosphate sensitivity may define two pools of releasable organelle calcium. The effect of pH perturbation on calcium homeostasis may partially account for the inhibition of neutrophil function by lysosomotropic amines.", 
    "14": "The role of the adrenergic mechanism in the pathogenesis of atopic diseases is controversial. Recent experimental and clinical reports have suggested that beta-2 adrenergic stimulation impairs and beta-2 adrenergic blockade enhances the histamine effect on vascular permeability. This led us to study the effect of salbutamol and of propranolol on histamine-induced cutaneous response in 13 healthy subjects and in 16 patients with allergic oculo-rhinitis. Both in normal subjects and in atopic patients salbutamol attenuated the whealing response to histamine and the protective effect of salbutamol was counteracted by propranolol. The ability, however, of salbutamol to inhibit histamine-induced response was significantly reduced in 50% of atopic patients. These findings suggest that beta-2 adrenergic hyporesponsiveness is present in some allergic patients.", 
    "15": "The pharmacology of the spinal and peripheral adrenergic receptor-subtypes controlling the micturition reflex was studied in a chronic unanesthetized rat model by continuous infusion of saline in the bladder and cystometrography after intrathecal (i.t.) and i.p. injections, respectively. Due to the absence of a catheter in the urethra, the bladder contraction-sphincter relaxation coupling could be assessed very precisely. For each agent tested in this study, dose-response curves were established. Norepinephrine (i.p.), methoxamine (i.p.) and ST-91 (i.p. and i.t.) produced an increase in frequency of bladder contraction. A decrease in frequency was observed after i.p. injection of isoproterenol (30 micrograms) and terbutaline (300 micrograms). Phentolamine, yohimbine, propranolol (i.p. and i.t.), isoproterenol (i.t.) and methoxamine (i.t.) had little or no effects on frequency of contraction at the highest doses examined. In addition, norepinephrine (i.p.), isoproterenol (i.p. and i.t.), ST-91 (i.p.), terbutaline (i.p.), phentolamine (i.p.) and yohimbine (i.p.) produced some relaxation of the bladder outlet. Methoxamine (i.p.) produced an increase in tone of the outlet. Propranolol (i.p. and i.t.), methoxamine (i.t.), ST-91 (i.t.), phentolamine (i.t.) and yohimbine (i.t.) had little or no effects on the tone of the bladder outlet at the highest doses examined. Those observations suggest that peripherally, catecholamines modulate the frequency of bladder contraction (increase through alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors; decrease through beta-2 receptors), and the tonic activity of the bladder outlet (increase in tone through alpha-1 receptors; relaxation through alpha-2 and beta-2 receptors). At the spinal level, noradrenergic systems appear to modulate the frequency of contraction and sphincter tone through alpha-2 receptors. Isoproterenol effects after i.t. injection are thought to be due to systemic distribution. However, absence of effects after i.t. injection of adrenergic antagonists suggests that spinal adrenergic systems might not be active during a normal volume-evoked micturition reflex, but might be activated in special circumstances, such as the voluntary act of retaining urine.", 
    "16": "To assess the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on atrial latency and atrial vulnerability, the electrophysiologic properties of the atrium were studied before and during intravenous infusion of isoproterenol at 2 to 5 micrograms/min in 11 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia exhibiting atrial latency during programmed atrial extrastimulation. In all patients, the isoproterenol infusion reduced the extent of maximum atrial latency (from 86 +/- 19 to 62 +/- 16 ms, p less than 0.001). This was accompanied by a significant shortening of both effective and functional refractory periods of the atrium (from 213 +/- 31 to 174 +/- 40 ms, p less than 0.005 and from 259 +/- 31 to 215 +/- 29 ms, p less than 0.001, respectively). The intra-atrial and interatrial conduction times were also significantly reduced (from 24 +/- 15 and 63 +/- 17 to 15 +/- 10 and 48 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.005, respectively). In 3 patients with demonstrable atrial vulnerability, the isoproterenol infusion abolished the inducibility of repetitive atrial responses or atrial flutter, or both. Although the clinical significance of the suppressive action of beta-adrenergic stimulation on atrial vulnerability remains to be determined, the present study has demonstrated that beta-adrenergic stimulation significantly reduces atrial latency.", 
    "17": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has potent negative dromotropic effects on the atrioventricular (AV) node, but variable effects on accessory pathway conduction have been described. The effects of an intravenous bolus injection of 8 mg ATP on accessory pathway and AV nodal conduction were determined during electrophysiologic testing with controlled atrial and ventricular rates. AV conduction was monitored during atrial or ventricular pacing at a constant cycle length, 30 msec longer than the cycle length at which block occurred. During atrial pacing antegrade block after administration of ATP occurred in 1 of 30 (3.2%) patients with accessory pathway conduction and 12 of 13 (92%) patients with AV nodal conduction (p less than 0.001). During ventricular pacing only 5 of 26 (16%) patients had accessory pathways blocked, whereas 25 of 35 (71%) patients with AV nodal conduction had block (p less than 0.001). Thus, failure of ATP to produce ventriculoatrial block identified the presence of an accessory pathway with a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 71%, and predictive value of 72%. There was no correlation between accessory pathway properties and the effects of ATP. The effects of ATP on the AV node were concordant with the effects of a combination of verapamil and propranolol in 21 of 23 patients, suggesting that this dose ATP is an equipotent AV nodal blocker with a short duration of action. Thus, although the effects of ATP on accessory pathways and the AV node differ, block in ventriculoatrial conduction after administration of ATP cannot be used as the sole criterion to distinguish the mechanism of conduction.", 
    "18": "In the presence of 1 microM ( +/- )-pindolol [to block 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 1B receptors] and 100 nM mesulergine (to block 5-HT 1C receptors), 2.0 nM [3H]5-HT binding to rat cortical homogenates is specific, saturable, and reversible. Scatchard analysis of [3H]5-HT binding, in the presence of 1 microM ( +/- )-pindolol and 100 nM mesulergine, produced a KD of 3.2 nM and Bmax of 43 fmol/mg protein. Distribution studies show this site to be present in most rat brain regions. This site is also detectable in human caudate. The pharmacological profile of this site is distinct from the previously identified 5-HT receptor subtypes. Compounds with high affinity for 5-HT 1A (8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin), 5-HT 1B (trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine), 5-HT 1C (mesulergine), 5-HT 2 (4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine), and 5-HT3 (ICS 205-930) receptors have low affinity for this site. These data suggest the presence of an additional, previously unidentified, 5-HT binding site in rat and human brain tissue. This putative novel 5-HT receptor has a similar pharmacology to the \"5-HT 1D\" site detected in bovine brain by Heuring and Peroutka.", 
    "19": "To evaluate autonomic influence on arrhythmogenesis in an animal preparation of triggered activity, we gave increasing doses of cesium chloride (0.125 to 5.0 mmol/kg iv) to 24 dogs distributed equally among four protocols of autonomic intervention: control, total denervation, beta-blockade, and left stellate stimulation. All dogs underwent atrioventricular node ablation followed by ventricular pacing. A left ventricular endocardial monophasic action potential (MAP) catheter allowed for detection of \"MAP early afterdepolarizations\" (mEAD). mEAD amplitude was measured relative to MAP amplitude. Cesium chloride (CsCl) increased both MAP duration (132% after 0.125 mmol/kg to 188% after 1.0 mmol/kg; p less than .001) and mEAD amplitude (20% after 0.125 mmol/kg to 49% after 1.0 mmol/kg; p less than .001) in a dose-dependent fashion. All dogs exhibited ventricular ectopy at roughly equivalent doses (0.88 +/- 0.5 mmol/kg). Cesium's peak effect on MAP characteristics, sinus node automaticity, and systolic blood pressure coincided with the onset of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). Whereas control and denervated dogs developed VT after similar doses of CsCl (1.21 +/- 0.1 vs 1.12 +/- 0.14 mmol/kg; p = NS), none of the six beta-blocked dogs developed sustained VT. Conversely, those dogs having undergone stellate stimulation developed VT after smaller doses (0.58 +/- 0.34 mmol/kg; p less than .001) and with earlier onset (12 vs 30 sec; p less than .025). After 0.5 mmol/kg of CsCl, left stellate stimulation augmented relative mEAD amplitude compared with control (51% vs 38%; p less than .001), whereas beta-blockade had little effect (39% vs 38%; p = NS). Autonomic intervention as such can affect the arrhythmogenicity of CsCl and similarly alter MAP characteristics. Furthermore, as beta-blockade can prevent sustained arrhythmia without eliminating mEADs, autonomic tone appears to modulate the expression of mEADs as sustained VT.", 
    "20": "To examine whether cardiopulmonary receptors participate in the reflex control of coronary vascular resistance, systemic and coronary hemodynamics were assessed before and during -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure in eight normal subjects and eight hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. In both study groups, lower body negative pressure induced a significant decrease in right atrial pressure, left ventricular filling pressure and cardiac output, an increase in systemic vascular resistance and no change in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In normal subjects, there was also a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine concentration (from 294 +/- 39 to 421 +/- 47 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). This increase was accompanied by a reduction in coronary blood flow, assessed by the continuous thermodilution method (from 101 +/- 5 to 79 +/- 4 ml/min, p less than 0.05). An increase in coronary vascular resistance (from 0.865 +/- 0.1 to 1.107 +/- 0.1 mm Hg/ml per min, p less than 0.05) and in myocardial oxygen consumption was detected in normal subjects during cardiopulmonary baroreceptor unloading. In contrast, in hypertensive patients, -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure failed to induce any change in plasma norepinephrine, coronary blood flow or vascular resistance. Intravenous propranolol administration caused no significant change in the systemic hemodynamic response to -10 mm Hg lower body negative pressure in either study group, but it did abolish the decrease in coronary flow and the increase in plasma norepinephrine, coronary vascular resistance and myocardial oxygen consumption observed in normal subjects in control conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The short-term cellular electrophysiologic actions of d-sotalol on isolated neonatal and adult canine ventricular myocardium and Purkinje fibers were evaluated using standard microelectrode techniques. d-Sotalol, 10(-6) to 10(-4)M, had no effects on action potential amplitude, maximal diastolic potential or action potential upstroke velocity (Vmax) in any neonatal or adult preparation. In five adult myocardial preparations, d-sotalol produced concentration-dependent increases in action potential duration at 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) repolarization and effective refractory period. In six neonatal myocardial preparations, d-sotalol produced a biphasic response; APD50, APD90 and effective refractory period decreased at 10(-6) and 10(-5)M. At 10(-4)M, these values increased significantly but to a lesser extent compared with values in adults. In seven adult Purkinje fibers, d-Sotalol significantly increased APD50, APD90 and effective refractory period in a concentration-dependent manner. All six neonatal Purkinje fibers responded in a biphasic manner, with values for APD50, APD90 and effective refractory period being less than control at 10(-6)M and near control values at 10(-5)M. At 10(-4)M, these variables were significantly increased, but to a lesser extent than in adult preparations. Our data confirm the typical class III effects of d-sotalol in adult cardiac tissues. The shortening of repolarization and refractoriness at lower drug concentrations in developing cardiac tissues may relate to age-dependent differences in cellular ionic function and basic electrophysiology.", 
    "22": "This study evaluated the ability of exercise Doppler echocardiography to identify hemodynamic changes due to cardiac medication. Twenty young healthy volunteers (mean age 30 years) underwent continuous wave Doppler examination from the suprasternal notch at rest, during each stage of a standard exercise protocol and immediately after exercise. On completion of the control test, each subject received either 60 to 80 mg of propranolol or 120 mg of verapamil orally, and the same exercise protocol was repeated after 90 min. During the control test, values for modal velocity, acceleration and flow velocity integral all increased significantly from baseline (p less than 0.0002 for each). When exercise was repeated after propranolol administration, values for all Doppler measurements were significantly altered. Modal velocity at baseline was significantly lower after propranolol when compared with control (0.53 +/- 0.11 versus 0.63 +/- 0.17 m/s; p less than 0.0001). Similarly, modal velocity at maximal exercise was significantly lower after propranolol (1.11 +/- 0.2 versus 1.25 +/- 0.21 m/s; p less than 0.0001). The effect of propranolol on acceleration was even greater, with blunting of baseline (11.4 +/- 2 versus 15.4 +/- 5 m/s per s; p less than 0.0005) and exertional (33.4 +/- 10 versus 56.3 +/- 15 m/s per s; p less than 0.0001) acceleration. The flow velocity integral during exercise was greater after propranolol (14.1 +/- 3.1 versus 10.1 +/- 3.2 cm; p less than 0.0005) than during the control test. Verapamil failed to influence any Doppler-measured index of aortic blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "To examine whether the typical nightly rise of nonesterified fatty acids in high yielding dairy cows is due to enhanced sympathoadrenal activity, the beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, was infused from 1800 to 0805 h. Concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids continuously increased, whereas those of glucose and insulin decreased. Nonesterified fatty acid concentration decreased within minutes in response to concentrate feeding, starting at 0700 h, in association with an increase of insulin and glucose. In a second experiment, adrenaline (.82 mumol/kg/min) was infused from 1800 to 1810 h, 0600 to 0610 h, and 0600 to 0610 h on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd d. After the second infusion, food was withdrawn for 23 h. Concentrations of adrenaline increased similarly. Nonesterified fatty acids and glucose responses were higher during the second than the first infusion. During fasting, nonesterified fatty acid concentrations increased, whereas glucose and insulin concentrations decreased. During the third infusion nonesterified fatty acids responses were unchanged, whereas glucose responses were decreased. Thus, the nightly rise of nonesterified fatty acids was not the consequence of enhanced beta-adrenergic activity. Responses of glucose and nonesterified fatty acids to adrenaline exhibited diurnal differences. Responses of glucose to adrenaline were reduced within 1 d of fasting, whereas those of nonesterified fatty acids were not altered.", 
    "24": "Orthostatic hypotension is one of the most troublesome symptoms in diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Some reports have suggested Pindolol - a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity - to be effective in the treatment of this condition. In order to elucidate the value of this therapy we performed a double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study with Pindolol (15 mg/day). Eight Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy and signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure decrease greater than 30 mm Hg when standing) participated in the study. Patients were treated for 10 weeks. Clinical examinations were performed every fortnight and patients registered postural symptoms twice daily on a visual analog scale. No significant changes were seen in blood pressure recordings, heart-rate or visual analog scale registration during treatment with Pindolol compared to placebo. Our study does not support the suggestion that Pindolol is a valuable drug for treatment of diabetic patients with autonomic neuropathy and postural giddiness.",

This study investigated, in a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial, the clinical usefulness of the combination of prazosin (2 mg b.i.d.) and verapamil (160 mg b.i.d.). Therapeutic efficacy was monitored at regular outpatient visits: average supine and erect blood pressures were, respectively, 175/99 and 176/103 mm Hg with placebo, 160/91 and 164/96 mm Hg with single drug treatment, and 152/84 and 152/89 mm Hg with combination therapy. This significant and clinically useful reduction in blood pressure had an overall magnitude of approximately 28/18 mm Hg (supine) and 29/19 mm Hg (erect). Further measurements were made during a series of intensive study days, and the most important additional finding was a pharmacokinetic interaction that resulted in increased peak concentrations and bioavailability of prazosin. In conclusion, the combination of prazosin and verapamil proved effective in the treatment of 12 patients with essential hypertension who had been poorly responsive to conventional treatment with a beta-blocker and thiazide diuretic.", 
    "26": "The differential effects of prazosin and labetalol on blood pressure and heart rate in the clinic and during daily activity were measured in a double-blind study utilizing automatic ambulatory monitors. One hundred five patients with essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure equal to 101 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to receive prazosin (n = 52) or labetalol (n = 53). Sixty-eight percent of labetalol-treated patients and 50 percent of prazosin-treated patients achieved blood pressure control during clinic visits (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) and were subsequently monitored for 12 hours of normal daily activities. Ambulatory monitoring revealed labetalol-treated patients to have significantly greater decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures during daily activity than prazosin-treated patients. Heart rate and rate-pressure product were significantly reduced in the labetalol group but not in the prazosin group. It is concluded that the potential benefits of dual adrenergic blockade, not readily apparent in the non-stressful clinic environment, become more evident during the course of daily activities.", 
    "27": "Beta blockers are frequently prescribed for survivors of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Although ventricular ectopic activity was found to be associated with mortality in several cohorts, there are no data on the relation of ventricular ectopic activity to mortality in patients with AMI who receive beta blockers. One thousand six hundred and fifty participants in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial who were randomized to receive propranolol (60 or 80 mg 3 times daily) had 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography at baseline. By multivariate analysis considering 16 variables, ventricular ectopic activity was independently associated with sudden death (p = 0.02 to 0.001) and total mortality (p = 0.04 to 0.0001) for an average follow-up of 25 months. By univariate analysis, ventricular ectopic activity was associated with increased total mortality (odds ratios 2.13 to 3.54) and sudden death mortality (odds ratio 2.26 to 3.93). The association of ventricular ectopic activity with mortality was observed in both high- and low-risk patient subsets with odds ratios similar to the placebo group. Thus, treatment with propranolol does not alter the relation between ventricular ectopic activity and mortality.", 
    "28": "The electrophysiologic effects of intravenous sotalol (1.5 mg/kg load followed by 0.008 mg/kg maintenance, mean dose 150 +/- 23 mg) and oral sotalol (mean dose 583 +/- 204 mg daily) were prospectively evaluated in 16 patients undergoing electrophysiologic evaluation for sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to coronary artery disease. Electrocardiographic intervals, indexes of sinus and atrioventricular node function and indexes of atrial and ventricular function were assessed. Inducibility or noninducibility of sustained VT and characteristics of the induced arrhythmia were also evaluated. Intravenous and oral sotalol exerted similar beta-blocking effects, which included significant prolongation of sinus cycle length (baseline 820 +/- 165 ms, intravenous sotalol 1,077 +/- 206 ms, oral sotalol 1,141 +/- 306 ms), AH interval (baseline 126 +/- 43, intravenous sotalol 169 +/- 42, oral sotalol 197 +/- 55 ms) and Wenckebach cycle length (baseline 375 +/- 70, intravenous sotalol 460 +/- 84, oral sotalol 449 +/- 68 ms). Both intravenous and oral sotalol also prolonged repolarization and refractoriness including significant increases in QT interval (baseline 338 +/- 47, intravenous sotalol 417 +/- 35, oral sotalol 450 +/- 70 ms), atrial effective refractory period (baseline 240 +/- 38, intravenous sotalol 330 +/- 71, oral sotalol 299 +/- 26 ms) and right ventricular effective refractory period (baseline 241 +/- 16, intravenous sotalol 289 +/- 35, oral sotalol 291 +/- 22 ms).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "In a one-year, double-masked, randomized study, the ocular hypotensive efficacy of twice-daily treatment with 0.25% levobunolol hydrochloride or timolol maleate was evaluated in 78 patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension (phase 1). If intraocular pressure (IOP) was not well controlled during the study, the concentration of medication was increased to 0.5%, and the patient was followed up for an additional three months (phase 2). During phase 1, the mean IOP was reduced by 4.6 mm Hg in the timolol treatment group and by 5.1 mm Hg in the levobunolol treatment group. Seventy-one percent (29/41) of the patients in the timolol treatment group and 70% (26/37) of the patients in the levobunolol treatment group successfully completed phase 1. Of those patients who required the higher concentration of medication, 89% (8/11) in the timolol treatment group and 75% (3/4) in the levobunolol treatment group successfully completed phase 2. Higher concentration, however, did not produce greater IOP reduction. No statistically or clinically significant differences between the groups were noted in any of the efficacy or safety variables evaluated.", 
    "30": "Prophylactic therapy to prevent the first variceal hemorrhage ceased being recommended for any cirrhotic because risks outweighed benefits. In this study, we identified cirrhotics that have never bled who are most prone to hemorrhage from varices. We developed a numerical grading system which combined size with other endoscopic characteristics, so varices would get an aggregate grade of 1 to 10. Varices were classified as either high grade (scored greater than or equal to 8) or low grade (scored less than or equal to 7). The grading system had a predictive value for bleeding when studied prospectively for a mean duration of 26 months in 52 patients subjected to placebo (15 patients) or various treatments (37 patients) in a randomized trial. High grade varices had a significantly higher association with bleeding than did low grade varices; 73% versus 7% (p less than 0.001) analyzing all 52 patients (of which 21% bled), and 83% versus 11% (p less than 0.05) analyzing the 15 placebo-treated patients (of which 40% bled). An esophagram positive for varices proved to be a sensitive screen for high grade varices, picking up 91% of them. However, it was a poor predictor of bleeding (one-third bled), since only 45% of radiologically evident varices were high grade. Since almost all cirrhotics with high grade varices can be expected to bleed within 2 yr, this group should be the focus of controlled trials to determine whether low risk prophylactic therapies reduce the incidence of first variceal hemorrhage.", 
    "31": "We present evidence, from studies with slow release verapamil and nifedipine, for Michaelis-Menten metabolism during first pass through the liver. Drug input rate from the GI-tract after an oral dose appears to be a determinant of bioavailability. Highest oral bioavailabilities are observed with standard release formulations at high dosage. The bioavailability of slow release formulations with a zero order release kinetic is lower than standard release formulations and related to the dissolution rate in vitro. In addition, (a) the presence of non-linear absorption kinetics offers a further explanation for the considerable inter-patient variability in AUC since the ability of drug to cross the liver is a function of the concentrations attained in portal blood which will be dependent on dissolution conditions prevailing in the GI-tract, (b) depending on the choice of the dose and dosage interval of the conventional release formulation used for comparison and as a consequence of Michaelis-Menten first pass metabolism it is possible to obtain relative bioavailability data showing superiority, equivalence or bioavailability loss with the slow release form. This may explain the discrepancies in bioavailability data for slow release drugs reported in the literature, (c) 'true' estimates of relative bioavailability of a slow release formulation can only be achieved if steady state conditions are present, and the dose and dosage interval of the slow and conventional release formulation are the same, (d) since a slower dissolution rate is 'ipso facto' associated with a lower bioavailability, slow release formulations of verapamil and nifedipine cannot be classified as being 'inferior' or of poorer quality on the basis of bioavailability alone.", 
    "32": "Phosphorylase was determined in biopsy samples frozen immediately or after a delay of 10 s to 6 min. Muscle biopsies were performed at rest without and with propranolol, or adrenalin infusion and after electrical stimulation. The phosphorylase a fraction was 36% (28-44) in resting samples frozen immediately and 12% (12-13) after 10 s delay and remained at the same level when the freezing was further delayed (up to 6 min). It is suggested that an increase in [Ca2+] in the cytoplasm due to the insertion of the needle in muscle or cutting of tissue membranes may cause transformation of phosphorylase from b to a form, a transformation which is restored when Ca2+ is pumped back during the delay. Also the increased phosphorylase a fraction observed in biopsy samples obtained during adrenalin infusion reverted partially back when freezing was delayed for 10 s and 30 s, respectively. In muscle samples taken during contraction the mole fraction of phosphorylase a decreased from 53 to 12% when freezing was delayed for 10 s. The lowest value of the phosphorylase a mole fraction was observed in resting muscle after beta-blockade when the tissue samples were frozen 10 s after sampling and corresponded to 10% of the total phosphorylase. It is concluded that both muscle sampling and circulating adrenalin will increase phosphorylase a fraction in resting muscle and probably also augment the effect of adrenalin infusion.", 
    "33": "In the present study the influence of beta-receptor blockers on uterine activity was examined. In the postpartum period of 16 enrollees blood pressure, heart frequency, contraction frequency, basal tone, contraction intensity as well as the Montevideo Units were recorded at intervals of 10 minutes during and after infusion of 0.8 resp. 1.6 mg pindolol. Pindolol with its inherent intrinsic sympathomimetic activity led to the well known decrease of blood pressure but did not increase uterine activity.", 
    "34": "The interactions of propranolol, nimodipine, and amiodarone with membrane lipids were examined in an effort to explain their different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Propranolol and nimodipine, which bind with high affinity to plasmalemmal beta-adrenergic and calcium channel receptors, respectively, have membrane partition coefficients of approximately 1200 and 5000 and are readily washed out of membranes with which they had been equilibrated. X-ray and neutron diffraction studies showed that after partitioning into lipid membranes, both propranolol and nimodipine are located approximately 6 A from the phosphate headgroup region of the membrane bilayer, near the hydrocarbon core/water interface. Amiodarone, which blocks Na and K channels with less site specificity than propranolol and nimodipine, has a much higher partition coefficient of approximately 1,000,000, resists washout from membrane bilayers, and is located deeper in the membrane, approximately 12 A from the phosphate headgroup region of the bilayer, nearer to the terminal methyl groups of the fatty acyl chains. The shorter durations of clinical action of propranolol and nimodipine may be related to the reversibility of their interactions with the region of the bilayer exposed to the aqueous media near the hydrocarbon core/water interface, whereas the much longer duration of clinical action of amiodarone may reflect a location more deeply within the fatty acyl region of the bilayer where this hydrophobic drug interacts avidly with the hydrocarbon core of the membrane.", 
    "35": "The effect of smoking a cigarette on bronchial responsiveness was studied in healthy non-smokers. Twenty two subjects performed a methacholine inhalation test before and after smoking a single cigarette. Ten of the subjects took part in a further study in which propranolol was inhaled before the smoking challenge to diminish the baseline beta adrenergic tone of the airway. After they had smoked a single filtered or non-filtered cigarette the indices of bronchial responsiveness (the cumulative dose of methacholine starting a decrease in the reciprocal of resistance, Grs (Dmin), and the cumulative dose causing a 35% drop in the Grs (PD35Grs)) did not change significantly. With the inhalation of propranolol mean (SD) log Dmin decreased from 1.37 (0.44) units to 0.74 (0.57) (p less than 0.01) and log PD35Grs from 1.93 (0.38) to 1.51 (0.38) (p less than 0.01). Smoking a single cigarette after the inhalation of propranolol did not, however, cause any further change in bronchial responsiveness. This study suggests that smoking a single filtered or non-filtered cigarette does not change bronchial responsiveness in non-smokers, and that changes in beta adrenergic tone of the airway do not modify the effect of smoking a single cigarette on bronchial responsiveness.", 
    "36": "The direct cardiac effects of hydralazine were studied in isolated working rat heart, isolated cat right ventricular papillary muscle, and isolated rabbit right atrium. The haemodynamics, myocardial energetics, and contractility of isolated hearts were measured at hydralazine concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 10 and 100 mumol.litre-1. Coronary flow was significantly increased (greater than or equal to 21%, p less than 0.01) in paced (325 beats.min-1) rat hearts at greater than or equal to 0.5 mumol.litre-1 hydralazine and in spontaneously beating hearts (greater than or equal to 37%; p less than 0.05) at greater than or equal to 1.0 mumol.litre-1 hydralazine. The increases in coronary flow occurred without significant increases in heart rate, contractility (dP/dtmax), or coronary perfusion pressure. Myocardial oxygen consumption was not significantly changed at any hydralazine concentration in spontaneously beating hearts and was unaltered in paced hearts except for a small significant increase (9.8%) at 10 mumol.litre-1. A negative inotropic effect was apparent at 100 mumol.litre-1 hydralazine as indicated by a significant reduction of dP/dtmax (paced and non-paced hearts), peak aortic flow rate (non-paced), and maximum left ventricular pressure (paced). In isolated cat papillary muscles and rabbit right atria, cumulative hydralazine log dose-response curves (0.1-1000 mumol.litre-1) were obtained. A positive inotropic effect that could be abolished by beta adrenergic blockade was produced in papillary muscles only at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 mumol.litre-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "Spontaneous EEG was recorded in nine cigarette smokers who had been abstinent from tobacco for 12 hr. Subjects were treated with a capsule containing either centrally acting nicotine blocker, mecamylamine (10 mg), or placebo. At each of three 60-min intervals after the capsule was ingested, the subjects chewed two pieces of gum containing a total of 0, 4 or 8 mg of nicotine. Nicotine and mecamylamine dose combinations were randomized across subjects. Two three-minute periods of spontaneous EEG were recorded before the capsule and before and after gum chewing from bipolar electrode montages at the following positions: Cz-T5, Cz-T6, Cz-F7 and Cz-F8. During one period the subjects relaxed with eyes closed, in the other period they performed a math task with eyes open. When the drugs were given individually, mecamylamine decreased beta power and nicotine gum (4 and 8 mg) increased alpha frequency. Mecamylamine pretreatment prevented the increase in alpha frequency caused by the 4 mg gum dose but not the 8 mg dose. Alpha power was increased by the 8 mg gum dose and that increase was prevented by mecamylamine. Self-reported ratings of the \"strength\" of the gum were significantly diminished by mecamylamine pretreatment. The data are consistent with the results of earlier studies which indicate that the effects of tobacco administration and withdrawal are mediated by central actions of nicotine.", 
    "38": "The electrophysiological effects of intravenous propranolol (0.15 mg/kg) were studied in 26 patients with sinus node dysfunction (SND group) and 9 patients with normal sinus node function (control group). Spontaneous cycle length and AH interval were significantly increased in the control and SND groups after propranolol. PA and HV intervals, calculated sinoatrial conduction time and refractory periods of the atrium, AV node and ventricle were not significantly changed in either group. Maximum corrected sinus node recovery time (max CSRT) was not changed in the control group, but it was significantly prolonged in the SND group. These results of the overdrive suppression test were in disagreement with those of previous studies. Propranolol lengthened spontaneous cycle length (by more than 200 msec) and/or max CSRT (by more than 1000 msec) in 8 of 26 patients with SND. Thus, it is suggested that propranolol should be used with caution in patients with SND.", 
    "39": "In order to avoid first-pass metabolism and to maintain therapeutically effective concentration of propranolol (PL) for a prolonged time, ointments of PL were prepared and the percutaneous (p.c.) absorption was investigated in rabbits. To describe the plasma PL concentration profile during repeated p.c. administrations, a simple pharmacokinetic model, including a first-order absorption process, was applied. The p.c. absorption of PL from both macrogol (400:4000, 30:40, g/g) and Carbopol 934 ointments was significantly increased by adding Azone (AZ). Effective plasma levels were sustained for about 10-20 h, but the absorption of PL from the macrogol ointment was relatively slow. The bioavailability of PL in the 5% PL Carbopol ointment with AZ was 13%. The plasma level of PL after application of Carbopol ointment was enhanced as PL was increased in the ointment, 3 to 5%. The repeated p.c. absorption studies were carried out by applying the 5% PL ointment daily for 3 d. The use of the pharmacokinetic model was justified by good agreement with the observed data after repeated applications of the ointment. Thus, the plasma PL concentration profile during repeated p.c. administrations can be predicted using the model.", 
    "40": "In order to localize the main site of action of the beta 2-adrenoceptor selective agonist terbutaline and the beta 1-adrenoceptor selective antagonist atenolol in the airways of asthmatic patients, we compared the effects of these drugs on maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves when breathing air and when breathing a helium-oxygen (HeO2) mixture. To investigate whether a shift in localization of the bronchodilator effect occurs when terbutaline is inhaled repeatedly, dose-response curves with terbutaline were performed for parameters derived from MEFV curves when breathing air and for density dependence of expiratory airflow. By measurement of MEFV curves when the patients were breathing air alone, it was not possible to determine whether there is a difference in the bronchoconstrictor effect of atenolol between large and small airways. Inhalation of terbutaline to a cumulative dose of 2.0 mg induced a stepwise improvement in expiratory airflow parameters for large and small airways function when breathing air. Doubling the dose of inhaled terbutaline to 4 mg did not result in any further improvement of lung function. Neither atenolol nor terbutaline induced significant mean changes in density dependence of expiratory airflow. This was partly due to large inter- and intra-individual variations of this parameter. Another possibility is that atenolol and terbutaline effect large and small airways function equally.", 
    "41": "Ligand binding studies indicate that multiple serotonin (5-HT) binding sites exist in the brain. To relate these putative receptor subtypes to startle reactivity and habituation, compounds with varying specificities for 5iHT1 and 5-HT2 binding sites were administered to rats prior to the presentation of 201 startling tactile stimuli. The 5-HT2 antagonists cyproheptadine, cinanserin, ritanserin, and ketanserin increased the rate of tactile startle habituation without affecting initial levels of reactivity. The 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, ipsapirone, and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, the 5-HT1B agonist m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine, and the 5-HT2 agonist quipazine affected startle reactivity rather than having specific effects on habituation. The effects of the exogenous 5-HT2 antagonists were consistent with the effects of manipulations of endogenous 5-HT. Specifically, the serotonin depleting agents parachlorophenylalanine and parachloroamphetamine accelerated startle habituation. Conversely, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine decreased startle habituation. These findings support the hypothesis that serotonergic systems modulate the habituation of tactile startle via actions at 5-HT2 receptors.", 
    "42": "The extent of serum protein binding of AL01576, phenytoin (DPH), diazepam (DIAZ), and propranolol (PRO) was evaluated in a group of nondiabetic and a group of insulin-dependent diabetic subjects, as well as in streptozotocin-treated rats. Both serum glucose and glucosylated protein levels were elevated in the diabetic patient population (179 and 150% of control values, respectively). The mean free fractions (fp) of AL01576, DPH, and PRO were not statistically different for the two human groups. The DIAZ fp was slightly elevated (P less than 0.05) in the diabetic patients (mean = 0.016) compared to the control group (mean fp = 0.014). An acute (less than 3 days) and chronic (greater than 20 days) diabetic rodent model was evaluated using Sprague-Dawley rats following streptozotocin administration (60 mg/kg i.p.). Both diabetic rat groups exhibited substantial increases in serum glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), and protein glucosylation compared to controls. The fp of AL01576 was increased in both the acute (mean = 0.248) and the chronic (mean = 0.202) condition compared to controls (mean = 0.163). The fp of DPH was also markedly increased in the acute (mean = 0.348) and the chronic (mean = 0.280) models compared to untreated controls (mean = 0.207). DIAZ and PRO binding was largely unaffected by the streptozotocin treatment. In vitro studies of purified human albumin suggest that a considerable degree of glucosylation would need to be present in diabetic serum before it would effectively alter drug binding. Our data suggest that only minor drug-serum binding changes occur in diabetic patients who are otherwise healthy and whose disease is well controlled.", 
    "43": "Sotalol is a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent with Vaughn-Williams class III activity. Its efficacy was tested in 9 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) that had previously remained inducible during electrophysiologic testing of type I drugs (procainamide or quinidine). Eight patients had coronary artery disease with remote myocardial infarction and 1 had cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 0.34 +/- 0.08, mean +/- standard deviation). Type I drugs prolonged the effective refractory period of the right ventricle 12 +/- 14% and prolonged the VT cycle length 41 +/- 24%. In contrast, despite an equivalent effect on the effective refractory period, a sustained VT could no longer be initiated in any of the 8 patients ultimately tested while taking oral sotalol. Daily doses averaged 600 +/- 103 mg and blood levels associated with VT suppression in electrophysiologic studies were generally greater than 3,000 ng/ml. In addition, sotalol was moderately effective at reducing ventricular ectopic activity measured by ambulatory electrocardiography. Over a mean follow-up of 23 months (range 1 to 37), mild heart failure (3 patients), symptomatic brady-cardia requiring pacemaker (1) and drug-related polymorphous VT (1) have occurred. Sudden death occurred in 1 patient and nonfatal VT recurrence was noted in 2. Five of 8 chronically treated patients currently are successfully treated with minimal side effects. Sotalol appears to be a promising antiarrhythmic drug in the treatment of serious ventricular arrhythmias, even in patients refractory to type I antiarrhythmic agents.", 
    "44": "1. A haemorrhage volume/plasma renin activity (PRA) response relationship was established for five levels of acute haemorrhage ranging from 1.5 to 15 ml/kg in conscious rats. In addition, the effects of chronic indomethacin and/or acute propranolol administration on the PRA response to 5 and 10 ml/kg haemorrhage was assessed. 2. Mean arterial pressure decreased in a haemorrhage volume dependent manner which was not significantly altered by indomethacin and/or propranolol. 3. Haemorrhage volumes of 1.5 and 3.0 ml/kg did not significantly alter PRA. At haemorrhage volumes of 5.0 ml/kg and higher, PRA increased in a volume-dependent manner. Propranolol decreased basal PRA levels but had little effect on the response to haemorrhage. Indomethacin had no effect on basal PRA, but attenuated the response to haemorrhage somewhat. When propranolol and indomethacin were combined, the PRA response to haemorrhage was significantly attenuated. 4. The conscious cannulated rat model exhibits predictable and reproducible renin responses to haemorrhage and is an excellent model for studying the control of renin secretion.", 
    "45": "The role of prazosin, an alpha 1 adrenoceptor blocker, was investigated in patients with chronic stable asthma who continued to have symptoms despite conventional treatment. Forty patients were entered into a double blind, placebo controlled, crossover trial to examine the effect of adding oral prazosin (2 mg twice daily) to previous medication for three weeks. Sixteen patients withdrew from the study. The remaining 24 patients showed no significant change in peak expiratory flow, FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, diary card symptom scores, or dose of beta sympathomimetic.", 
    "46": "The case of a 69 year old man with a right adrenal pheochromocytoma who manifested cyclic fluctuations of blood pressure with a cycle length of 9 to 13 min is reported. We collected and reviewed 14 similar cases previously reported in the literature. In these cases, right adrenal pheochromocytoma was most common, while 1 case involved the left adrenal and 2 cases were of extra-adrenal origin. The incidence in males was twice that in females and the median age was 45.3 years. Although a good correlation between the blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentrations was observed in our patient, the exact mechanism for the cyclic fluctuations of blood pressure is not known. In our patient, both YM-09538 and bunazosin were effective in controlling severe hypertension preoperatively. YM-09538 induced significant increases in urinary norepinephrine concentrations (1327 +/- 238 micrograms/day), while bunazosin induced a significant decrement in urinary norepinephrine concentrations (475 +/- 188 micrograms/day) compared with pretreatment levels (900 +/- 42 micrograms/day) (p less than 0.01). These observations indicated that bunazosin as a postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker interfered with release of norepinephrine from the tumor and thus might be beneficial in the management of elevated blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma.", 
    "47": "The effect of 1600 mg/day ibuprofen in two groups of patients with hypertension controlled by either propranolol or bendrofluazide was studied in a double-blind, double-placebo, randomized crossover trial. No significant difference in blood pressure was found at the end of the crossover period in either group, suggesting that the routine co-administration of ibuprofen does not attenuate the anti-hypertensive effect of thiazide diuretics or propranolol. Significant weight gain, attributable to fluid retention, had occurred in the bendrofluazide-treatment group by the end of the drug-free washout period. No significant change in mean weight occurred in the crossover stages in either group, although substantial weight gain was noted during ibuprofen treatment in two patients given bendrofluazide and one given propranolol. Biochemical variables were unaffected by ibuprofen throughout the crossover period. This study suggests that ibuprofen may be administered routinely to patients receiving thiazides or propranolol without loss of control of the anti-hypertensive action of these drugs but it is recommended that individuals are monitored for possible weight gain or an increase in diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "48": "Ten eyes of nine patients with endothelial dystrophy requiring iridectomy for acute angle-closure glaucoma developed corneal edema sufficient to require penetrating keratoplasty. Because of the proximity of iris to cornea, simultaneous lens extraction was carried out to prevent malignant glaucoma. Penetrating keratoplasty using techniques presented here provided improved visual acuity and control of glaucoma in all cases.", 
    "49": "In most animal species, left ventricular hypertrophy due to pressure overload is associated with an advantageous increase of the \"slow\" V3 isomyosin. In contrast, in spontaneously hypertensive turkeys, the development of left ventricular hypertrophy is associated with the synthesis of a \"fast\" V1-like isomyosin, with high incidence of cardiac failure. This could be related to the high catecholamine levels found in these animals. This is why we studied the ventricular myosin pattern after lowering of blood pressure and regression of cardiac hypertrophy obtained by means of labetalol, and alpha- and beta-blocking drug which inhibits the effects of catecholamines. From the 2nd to the 32nd week of age, 22 turkeys were treated with increasing doses of p.o. labetalol (from 20 to 35 mg/kg body weight daily) and 16 other turkeys were given daily p.o. placebo. Blood pressure and heart rate were periodically measured by an indirect method. After sacrifice, the degree of cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by the biventricular weight to body weight ratio, ventricular myosin was purified, Ca++-activated ATPase activity assessed, and ventricular myosin pattern was determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of myosin heavy chains. Plasma and cardiac catecholamines were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Throughout the study period, blood pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced in the labetalol-treated animals as compared to the untreated ones. At the end of the study period, the ventricular mass was significantly lower in the labetalol group. Nevertheless, no differences were observed in ventricular myosin pattern and Ca++-activated ATPase activity levels between the two groups. In the labetalol group, an increase in plasma catecholamines and only a slight, but not significant, increase in cardiac catecholamines was found. These data indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive turkeys, the synthesis of the \"fast\" V1-like isomyosin is not influenced by known pathophysiological stimuli like blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy and catecholamines.", 
    "50": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of acute and chronic propranolol on heart size and regional O2 supply/consumption variables in thyroxine (T4)-treated rabbit hearts. New Zealand white rabbits were given 0.5 mg/kg T4 for 3 or 16 days with and without concomitant 2 mg/kg propranolol. Another group was given 16 days of propranolol alone and another 3-day T4 group was given 2 mg/kg propranolol 1 h before the experiment began. Another group served as control. Myocardial blood flows were determined using radioactive microspheres and small arteriolar and venous O2 saturations were determined using microspectrophotometry. Treatment with T4 for 3 or 16 days increased the heart weight/body weight ratio, myocardial blood flow, and regional O2 consumption. 16-day T4 treatment resulted in myocardial flow 195% and O2 consumption 300% above control group values. When propranolol was given chronically along with T4, heart weight/body weight ratios did not increase to the degree seen with 3 or 16 days of T4, alone. Propranolol given acutely in 3-day T4-treated animals, resulted in a reduced O2 consumption and O2 extraction, though not to the extent seen with chronic propranolol treatment of T4-treated animals. Acute propranolol treatment slightly reduced myocardial blood flow in 3-day T4-treated animals, while chronic treatment significantly reduced it. Chronic propranolol treatment in 16-day T4-treated animals resulted in a significant reduction in flow and O2 consumption. Thus, T4 treatment increased O2 consumption, flow, and heart size and these effects could be attenuated using acute and chronic propranolol.", 
    "51": "In seven normal subjects we investigated whether a nonadrenergic bronchodilator nervous system is demonstrable in humans in vivo. After inhalation of leukotriene D4 (LTD4), respiratory resistance (Rrs) increased by 115 +/- 11% (SE). Subsequent inhalation of 2 nmol of capsaicin induced coughing and a fall in Rrs of 22.1 +/- 2% (P less than 0.01). However, inhalation of the diluent of capsaicin, 10% saline-ethanol, decreased Rrs similarly. These bronchodilator responses were not altered by inhaled ipratropium bromide (120 micrograms) and oral propranolol (80 mg). After ipratropium and propranolol, voluntary coughing alone decreased Rrs by 25 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05). We next investigated whether these bronchodilator responses could be blocked by anesthesia of the airways with inhaled lidocaine. After inhalation of lidocaine and LTD4, capsaicin aerosol induced coughing and a transient increase in Rrs of 18 +/- 6% (P less than 0.05) but no bronchodilation. Inhalation of saline-ethanol (n = 4) and a deep inhalation (n = 6) decreased Rrs by 18 +/- 4% (P less than 0.05) and 34 +/- 3% (P less than 0.001), respectively. We conclude that in normal subjects a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic bronchodilator mechanism exists, which can be activated by inhalation of capsaicin and inhibited by local anesthesia.",

This observation is not consistent with the suggestion that abnormal waveforms are associated with obliteration of the tertiary stem villus arterioles.", 
    "53": "Huntington's disease is characterized by striatal degeneration, leading to progressive choreoathetoid movements, dementia and behavioral changes. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant illness with complete penetrance. New technology has localized the aberrant gene, and presymptomatic and even prenatal testing may eventually be available. Although no definitive treatment currently exists, judicious use of neuroleptics, appropriate referrals and a strong therapeutic alliance with the family may be helpful.", 
    "54": "Therapeutic interventions in patients with myocardial infarction, whether during the first hours after coronary occlusion or several days later, aim to reduce mortality and morbidity by several mechanisms: Prevention of fatal ventricular fibrillation, limitation of infarct size, and inhibition of platelet aggregation are some examples of such mechanisms. Results from early intervention trials with beta blocking agents, particularly from ISIS-I, suggest that 1-year mortality is significantly lower in selected patients randomized to active treatment. Late intervention studies also suggest a significant reduction in coronary mortality and morbidity with beta blockade, particularly when data are pooled. Studies with the calcium channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil were unable to demonstrate any beneficial effects of these drugs on mortality or reinfarction. In this review article, attention will be directed to the most recent information about the preventive value of beta adrenergic blocking drugs and slow calcium channel inhibitors.", 
    "55": "The goal of early intervention of acute coronary occlusion by beta blockers is to reduce ultimate infarct size and to consequently reduce morbidity and mortality. Until 1986 small early intervention trials suggested that infarct size may be reduced by 25% if treatment was started within 6 to 10 hours after the onset of symptoms. At this time, an average of 80% of the infarct is fully developed. On the basis of previous trials, the reduction of infarct size has been associated with improvement of symptoms, prevention of infarct development, reduced occurrence of arrhythmias and reinfarctions, and earlier discharge from the hospital. Although the trials suggested some benefit in mortality, this issue has not been solved. The MIAMI trial randomized 5778 patients to blind treatment with metoprolol or placebo. ISIS-I randomized 16,027 patients to atenolol with an open label. No titration of the effect on lowering myocardial oxygen requirement was attempted. Both studies included less than 25% of all eligible patients. Exclusions were chiefly due to current beta blocker or calcium blocker treatment. Thus, the results obtained concern only a selected group of patients. In MIAMI only 15% received treatment within 6 hours, while in ISIS 38% were treated within 4 hours. It is therefore likely that in most patients the infarcts were completed before intervention was started. Thus, the two trials did not differentiate between primary and secondary effects on the acute myocardial infarct. Mortality was reduced by 13% (NS) and 15% (p less than 0.04), respectively, in MIAMI and ISIS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The relaxant effect on smooth muscle of nitro compounds is suggested to be linked with the increase in the tissue level of cyclic GMP by activating guanylate cyclase. In this study, we investigated the effects of nipradilol, a new beta-blocker, which has NO2 residue in the molecular structure, and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) on guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle in comparison with the effect of propranolol. Nipradilol and ISDN showed dose-dependent relaxant effects on leukotriene (LT) D4-induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle, though propranolol had no effect. 8-Bromo-cyclic GMP also showed a relaxant effect dose dependently. Nipradilol and ISDN elevated cyclic GMP levels in tracheal tissue dose dependently; however, propranolol caused no change in cyclic GMP levels. From these results, it is suggested that nipradilol relaxes LTD4-induced contraction of tracheal smooth muscle by increasing the tissue level of cyclic GMP.", 
    "57": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy, effective dose, administration frequency and antianginal effect of a new antianginal agent, nipradilol, in 12 patients with stable effort angina. A single blind design was employed; the test consisted of an observation period (1 week) and a treatment period (1-2 weeks). Twenty four hour Holter monitoring was performed on the penultimate day of each period. Nipradilol was administered twice a day at a daily dose of 3-12 mg (mean 7.9 +/- 3.3 mg). The mean frequency of ST-segment depression was 7.1 +/- 6.7 times per day at baseline and 3.1 +/- 2.7 after drug administration, showing a significant reduction (p less than 0.05). The suppression of ST-segment depression and decrease in heart rate due to this drug persisted for 12 hours following administration. The plasma drug concentration at a daily dose of 12 mg peaked at 9.5 +/- 2.4 ng/ml 1 hour after administration and the 12 hour value was 2.3 +/- 1.2 ng/ml. No side effects were observed. Therefore, it seems that, when administered twice a day (total daily dose 6 mg) this drug is effective in effort angina and that the antianginal effect is mainly attributable to beta-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "58": "The synthesis and properties of a fluorescent derivative of the hydrophilic beta-adrenergic antagonist CGP-12177 are described. The fluorescence of the NBD derivative of CGP-12177 (CGP-NBD) is extremely sensitive to its environment, the quantum yield increasing 23-fold upon transfer from water to acetonitrile. This property of CGP-NBD was taken into account and a procedure was developed using quantitative chloroform extraction of ligand for the measurement of CGP-NBD bound specifically to beta-receptors on A431.E3 membranes. The fluorescent NBD-derivative of CGP-12177 bound strongly and specifically to A431 cells, a KD of 3.9 x 10(-10) M being measured; the specific binding represented 63% of the total binding at a concentration of 1 x 10(-8) M (256 x KD). A431.E3 cells were used for the binding studies since they gave consistently higher receptor numbers when compared with the native strain. A maximal number of 47,000 sites/cell and a KD of 100 pM were measured with CGP-12177 on adhered cells. The receptor number was strongly dependent upon cell density with only 3000 sites/cell being measured in suspension at confluence.", 
    "59": "Inula racemosa root powder was investigated in patients with proven ischaemic heart disease. The powder prevented ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion as observed in the post-exercise electrocardiogram. The petroleum ether extract of roots lowered plasma insulin and glucose levels within 75 min of oral administration to albino rats and it significantly counteracted adrenaline-induced hyperglycaemia in rats. The extract further showed negative inotropic and negative chronotropic effects on frog heart. All these findings indicate that one of the constituents of Inula racemosa may have adrenergic beta-blocking activity.", 
    "60": "The infusion of a small volume of blood with temperature higher (\"warm\") or below (\"cold\") the temperature of atrial blood into the right atrium induced \"warm\" tachycardia and \"cold\" bradycardia, resp., in anesthetized and in alert cats. Infusion of the blood with temperature equal to that of atrial blood induced no changes of the heart rate. Infusion of the same volume of \"cold\" or \"warm\" blood after adreno- and cholinoreceptor-blocking agents was accompanied by a less severe tachycardia or bradycardia. There seem to be two mechanisms in the initiation of the above effects: the neural and the myogenic ones.", 
    "61": "In 22 dogs, blockade of adrenergic and M-cholinergic structures reduced hemodynamic effect of prostaglandin E2. After blockade of beta-adrenoreceptor the injection of prostaglandin E2 induced lesser changes in hemodynamic values than after blockade of alpha-adreno- and M-cholinoreactive structures.", 
    "62": "A disorder in the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow due to a drop of arterial blood pressure (shift to the right) occurred earlier in hypotensive rats than in normotensive ones.

    "63": "Contractile responses of small intestine segments to isopropylnoradrenaline (INA) disappeared after the blockade of M- and N-cholinoreceptors, beta-adrenoreceptors and increased after the blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors. Infusion of acetylcholine in subthreshold doses enhanced the small intestine contractile responses to the INA. The blockade of beta-adrenoreceptors with propranolol reduced contractile responses to exogenous (i. a. administration) and endogenous (electrical stimulation of the n. vagus' efferent fibers) acetylcholine, histamine and bradykinin. Stimulation of beta-adrenoreceptors with the INA enhanced contractile responses to exogenous acetylcholine and histamine and reduced the responses to bradykinin. The data obtained suggest the existence of activating beta-adrenoreceptors, apart from alpha- and beta-inhibitory adrenoreceptors, in the small intestine. Activating beta-adrenoreceptors are situated on cholinergic interneurons of the myenteric plexus and mediate the activating effect of endogenous catecholamines upon cholinergic neurons of small intestine.",

    "65": "I.v. propranolol (Prop) produced sustained pressor responses in rats but not in dogs under urethane anesthesia. In the dogs there was a progressive reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in accordance with a significant heart rate (HR) reduction. Even at the i.v. dose (5 mg/kg) where vasoconstrictor response to i.v. norepinephrine (NE) is changed to the vasodilator one in rats, phenoxybenzamine could not completely suppress the NE-induced vasoconstriction in dogs. In pithed dogs, unlike pithed rats, i.v. Prop augmented neither sympathetic nerve stimulation- nor i.v. epinephrine (Epi)-induced pressor responses. Urethane anesthesia brought much higher concentrations in plasma Epi and NE in the dog than in the rat. In comparison with their respective values under the conscious state, SBP and HR of the dog were higher and those of the rat were lower under urethane anesthesia. As in urethane-anesthetized dogs, i.v. Prop elicited remarkable HR reduction accompanied by progressive hypotension in coronary-ligated rats with high sympathetic activity. Thus the reason for the absence of pressor response to beta-receptor blockage in the dog may be due to less functional significance of beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in determining the peripheral vascular tone; and also, the possibility that there may be the involvement of an inverse influence of urethane on the cardiovascular regulatory system in terms of enhancing sympathetic nervous activity in the dog and a decreasing one in the rat can not be ruled out.", 
    "66": "Beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized in human fat cell membranes using 125I-labeled cyanopindolol (125I-labeled CYP) and highly selective beta 1-antagonists. The iodinated radioligand bound saturably and specifically to a single class of high affinity binding sites. The number of binding sites determined with 125I-labeled CYP closely agreed with that determined with two other tritiated radioligands: [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]CGP-12,177. Since 125I-labeled CYP does not discriminate between beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, the densities of the two receptor subtypes were determined from the competition curves of 125I-labeled CYP by highly selective beta 1-antagonists (bisoprolol, ICI-89,406, CGP-20,712A, and LK-204,545). Moreover, in order to enable correlation with binding data, the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity and of lipolysis was tested with various beta-agonist and antagonist compounds. The results obtained on fat cell membranes from abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue demonstrated the following. 1) 125I-labeled CYP represents a valuable tool for the quantification and the delineation of beta-receptor subtypes. 2) The presence of sodium ions in binding buffers causes a modification of the affinity of beta-sites for some beta-antagonists. 3) The human fat cell beta adrenergic receptor population defined by nonselective radioligands is composed of two subtypes that can be interpreted in terms of classic beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes as assessed by competition studies with highly selective antagonists; beta 2-sites are predominant (60-70% of 125I-labeled CYP sites) in the adipocytes of slightly overweight women. 4) Results support the idea that beta 1- as well as beta 2-adrenergic receptors are coupled with adenylate cyclase and involved in the induction of lipolysis. 5) The results focus on the interest in some beta 2-agonist drugs (zinterol, clenbuterol) as partial inductors of lipolysis, with the lipolytic efficacies of these compounds being well correlated with their efficacies at 125I-labeled CYP sites.", 
    "67": "A new cardioselective and rapidly metabolized beta-blocker, esmolol (E), was given to prevent post-intubation tachycardia in 40 ASA Class PS I-II patients induced with thiopental, succinylcholine, N2O: O2 and enflurane sequence. The control group (A, n = 10) received 5% D/W. Three study groups received E loading doses of 500 micrograms/kg/min for 1 min (B, n = 8), 2 min (C, n = 10) and 4 min (D, n = 12); the continuous i.v. maintenance doses were 100, 200 and 300 micrograms/kg/min for a total of 10 min, respectively. The pre-esmolol heart rates were 85 +/- 4 in group A, 80 +/- 5 in B, 77 +/- 5 in C, 83 +/- 5 in D; at anesthetic induction and at 4 min after E-infusion, heart rates were 93 +/- 5, 65 +/- 4, 71 +/- 4, 70 +/- 5, respectively; three min post-intubation heart rates were in the control group 111 +/- 4 and 82 +/- 5, 93 +/- 5, 85 +/- 4, respectively, in the E-treated groups. Group A showed marked tachycardia (p less than or equal to 0.001) not observed in the treated groups B, C, D. A significant blockade of HR increases at all infusion rates of E (p less than or equal to 0.05) was found. E at all doses reduced the significant increase in BP observed in Group A. Catecholamine increases were identical and not significantly different among the groups.

    "68": "The stereoselective hydrolysis of esmolol was examined in blood from several species including humans. Blood esmolol esterase activity was in the order of guinea pigs greater than rats greater than rabbits greater than dogs greater than rhesus monkeys greater than humans. Dog and rat blood esterases hydrolyzed the (-)-enantiomer of esmolol faster than the (+)-enantiomer whereas rhesus monkey, rabbit, and guinea pig blood esterases hydrolyzed the (+)-enantiomer faster. Human blood esterases did not demonstrate stereoselectivity. Dog liver esterases also showed stereoselectivity towards the (-)-enantiomer but dog skeletal muscle esterases did not. Studies in mongrel dogs indicated that during esmolol infusions the concentration ratio of (-)-esmolol/(+)-esmolol was approximately 0.85. After termination of the esmolol infusion the (-)/(+) concentration ratio continuously decreased until (-)-esmolol was no longer quantifiable. These results indicate that stereoselective hydrolysis of esmolol occurs in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "69": "alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors in detrusor muscle and bladder base of horses were investigated by in vitro responses of smooth muscle strips to exogenous agonist and antagonist drugs. Noradrenaline, isoprenaline and salbutamol induced relaxation of detrusor muscle strips which was significantly inhibited by propranolol and butoxamine suggesting that the response is mediated by beta-2 adrenergic receptors. In the urinary bladder base noradrenaline, phenylephrine and B-HT 920 induced strong contractile effects. These contractile responses were inhibited by the alpha antagonist phenoxybenzamine, the alpha-1 selective antagonist prazosin and the alpha-2 selective antagonist yohimbine. The inhibitory action of prazosin was more potent than that observed with yohimbine suggesting that the response in the bladder base of horses is mediated predominantly by alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, although alpha-2 receptors also participate.", 
    "70": "In an attempt to identify possible beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the cat retina the authors extended their previous studies on the effects of beta-agonists (Graefe's Arch. clin. exp. Ophthalmol. 225: 33-38, 1987) to three beta-adrenergic antagonists: propranolol, ICI 118.551, and timolol were applied in micromolar concentrations to the arterially perfused, dark-adapted cat eye. The rod ERG b-wave was generally depressed, sometimes enhanced after initial depression (propranolol), without showing any clear-cut dose-dependency. In contrast, the rod-mediated optic nerve action potential exhibited dose-dependent depression of the plateau and OFF components. All effects were reversible within 60-80 minutes. These results, in conjunction with earlier data on the effects of beta-agonists and recent biochemical and autoradiographic studies, strongly support the theory that there are beta-adrenergic synaptic mechanisms located in the inner layers of the mammalian retina.", 
    "71": "beta-adrenergic receptors were localized and characterized in control and cryptorchidized rats to investigate further their role in testicular function. Slide-mounted cryostat sections were incubated with [125I]cyanopindolol, a specific ligand for beta-adrenergic receptors. The subtypes were characterized by the displacement of [125I]cyanopindolol binding by practolol, which binds preferentially to the beta 1 subtype, and zinterol, which is preferential for beta 2 receptors. Labeling was detected by autoradiography, first by exposing sections to Ultrofilm (LKB) and second by dipping slides in NTB-2 Kodak photographic emulsion. The histologic distribution of receptors was analyzed by counting silver grains overlying the testicular structures. It was found that the vast majority of receptors were of the beta 2-subtype. In intact rats, the greatest density of receptors was found in interstitial cells, with some specific labeling over the seminiferous tubules. However, in cryptorchidized animals, the proportion of beta 2 receptors in tubules that contained mainly Sertoli cells appeared to be markedly increased. The results obtained suggest that catecholamines have multiple sites of action in the testis.", 
    "72": "1. The pressor responses produced by the intravenous administration of alpha,beta-methylene ATP were tachyphylactic. 2. alpha,beta-Methylene ATP can attenuate pressor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation both in the presence and in the absence of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents. 3. alpha,beta-Methylene ATP has no effect on the pressor responses produced by bolus injections of noradrenaline. 4. In the presence of alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents, alpha,beta-methylene ATP further attenuates contractions of the vas deferens produced by nerve stimulation. 5. The results, together with previous data, suggest that the vasopressor response to stimulation of the sympathetic outflow in the rat is partly purinergic and partly alpha-adrenergic and that this occurs as co-transmission. The same applies to rat vas deferens, confirming in vitro data. The pithed rabbit had an alpha-blocker-resistant vasopressor nerve-mediated response but this was resistant to alpha,beta-methylene ATP.", 
    "73": "Recent large scale antihypertensive treatment trials emphasise the importance of blood pressure control in reducing both cerebrovascular accidents and myocardial infarction. Obviously therefore, the drug that best normalises blood pressure while producing the fewest adverse effects should be sought. On the basis of studies demonstrating cellular membrane and calcium homeostatic derangements and an age-dependent transition of overall cardiovascular regulation and peripheral vasoconstrictor forces during the course of essential hypertension, this review proposes an alternative treatment. Under this treatment scheme angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers should be used in younger patients and in those with high plasma renin activity, while calcium antagonists are used in place of diuretics in older low-renin or Black patients. Age-oriented 2-way drug selection enables a normalisation of blood pressure without untoward effects in about 80% of patients with essential hypertension and helps to optimise drug combinations in those patients who are difficult to treat.", 
    "74": "Infusion of esmolol, an ultra short acting beta-blocker was used in the acute management of 48 patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Following acute control of the heart rate, patients received maintenance of esmolol infusion for 6 h when they were transferred to alternate oral antiarrhythmic agents. Prompt control of heart rate (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 8.8 mins) was achieved in 85% of patients with esmolol at a dose rate of 80 +/- 59 micrograms/kg/min. Ninety percent of these subjects were successfully transferred to alternate oral therapy. Five subjects experienced transient side effects. Esmolol was highly effective and particularly suitable for the acute management of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.", 
    "75": "The purpose of the present study was to devise a technique for the isolation of a relatively homogeneous mononuclear leukocyte (MNL) preparation from rabbit whole blood and determine the density and affinity of beta-adrenoceptors on MNL. A modified method based upon that by B\u00f6yum was developed to maximize isolation of MNL from red blood cells (RBC), granulocytes, and platelets. The method involved an initial centrifugation to remove platelets and two centrifugations with a Ficoll solution to eliminate RBC and granulocytes. beta-Adrenoceptor density as determined with [125I]cyanopindolol and MNL membrane or whole cell preparations ranged between 317 and 360 sites per cell. Affinity for the binding sites was dependent upon whether membrane or whole cell preparations were studied, being 56.3 +/- 9.9 and 11.4 +/- 1.4 pM, respectively. Binding sites were found to be saturable and noncooperative. In addition, the binding sites demonstrated selectivity and stereospecificity for beta-adrenoceptor ligands. It is concluded that the modified method of harvesting MNL from rabbit whole blood provides a relatively homogeneous cell suspension that can be used to study the beta-adrenoceptor system.", 
    "76": "The efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic parameters of a 30-mg oral dose of cetamolol hydrochloride (Betacor), a new synthetic cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were evaluated by studying 32 hypertensive patients with normal renal function or different degrees of renal impairment. After administration of cetamolol, serial blood and urine sample collections, as well as vital sign determinations for the next 48 hours, were performed in all patients (with the exception of urine collection, which was not possible in hemodialysis patients). Results indicate that cetamolol's pharmacokinetic parameters are significantly changed in patients who have moderate or severe renal impairment. Specifically, as the severity of renal impairment increased, the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and the area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) increased, whereas the renal clearance (CLR), urinary excretion, and total body clearance (CL) decreased. Additionally, significant direct or inverse correlations for AUC, CL, CLR, and urinary excretion with creatinine clearance (CLCR) were demonstrated. In the subjects with mild renal impairment, the trends toward changes in the cetamolol pharmacokinetic parameters were evident, though small and not statistically significant. Although anuric, patients on hemodialysis still retained the ability metabolically to clear cetamolol at a rate of about one-third of that found in normal subjects. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate also were found to be greater and more prolonged as the severity of renal impairment increased. There were no adverse drug or toxic effects noted in any of the study patients. Based on these findings, dosing recommendations are suggested for patients who have compromised renal function because of the effects of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of cetamolol.", 
    "77": "The pharmacokinetics of unchanged and total (unchanged plus Glusulase [Biotechnology Systems, Boston, MA]) released dilevalol and secretion into human breast milk was studied in six healthy breast-feeding female volunteers administered a single 400-mg dilevalol hydrochloride capsule. In plasma, the mean Cmax for unchanged dilevalol, 485 ng/mL was reached at 0.8 hour (tmax) and the AUC(48 hours) was 1435 hr X ng/mL. Pharmacokinetic analysis of unchanged dilevalol in plasma showed that dilevalol was distributed and eliminated with half-lives of 0.9 and 8.2 hours, respectively. Breast milk concentrations of unchanged dilevalol as a function of time, paralleled those of plasma but were consistently lower. The milk Cmax, 149 ng/mL, occurred during the 0 to 2 hour collection interval; the AUC(42 hours) for unchanged dilevalol in milk was 663 hr X ng/mL. The mean milk to plasma concentration ratio was 0.46. The unchanged dilevalol plasma concentrations were 12 to 18% those of total drug suggesting that the drug is extensively conjugated. By contrast, the concentrations of unchanged dilevalol in breast milk, based on Cmax and AUC data were 63 to 94% those of total drug, indicating that very little conjugated drug is secreted into breast milk. Through 48 hours, a mean of only 27 micrograms dilevalol or 0.007% of the administered dose was secreted into breast milk, which is much less than that reported for other beta blockers."
