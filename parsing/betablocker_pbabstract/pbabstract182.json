    "0": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the primary cause of death in women for almost a century, and more women than men have died of CVD every year since 1984. Although CVD incidence can be reduced by adherence to a heart-healthy lifestyle and detection and treatment of major risk factors, preventive recommendations have not been consistently or optimally applied to women. The American Heart Association guidelines for CVD prevention in women provide physicians with a clear plan for assessment and treatment of CVD risk and personalization of treatment recommendations. The emphasis of preventive efforts has shifted away from treatment of individual CVD risk factors in isolation toward assessment of a woman's overall or \"global\" CVD risk. In addition to accounting for the presence or absence of preexisting coronary heart disease or its equivalents (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease), cardiovascular risk can be further calculated with the Framingham risk score, which is based on age, sex, smoking history, and lipid and blood pressure levels. Intervention intensity and treatment goals are tailored to overall risk, with those at highest risk receiving the most intense risk-lowering interventions. Women at high risk for CVD and without contraindications should receive aspirin, beta blockers, and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in addition to pharmacologic therapy for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. Women who already are at optimal or low risk for CVD should be encouraged to maintain or further improve their healthy lifestyle practices. Optimal application of these preventive practices significantly reduces the burden of death and disability caused by heart attack and stroke in women.",

    "2": "Examinations were performed on a Siemens Somatom Sensation 64 scanner with a total of 110 ml of contrast agent and ECG pulsing (interval from 40% to 70%) after oral application of a beta-blocker if the heart rate was higher than 65 bpm. All human subjects were referred for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease. Coronary artery segments were evaluated by two experienced radiologists in a consensus reading. A ranking of diagnostic image quality (from 1 (no evaluation possible) to 5 (excellent image quality)) was statistically evaluated by Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test.", 
    "3": "In 45 patients (30 male, 15 female, age 63.8 +/- 12.1 years) we detected a significant advantage of the 60% reconstruction interval over 40%, 50%, and 70% (for each p < 0.05). In cases of sudden arrhythmia or movement during the scan, additional reconstruction intervals within the ECG-pulsed reconstruction intervals remained necessary for diagnosis.", 
    "4": "In a routine diagnostic setting with frequency controlled patients and ECG pulsing the 60% reconstruction interval can be considered superior for the initial diagnosis in 64-row multislice computed tomography coronary angiography. However, further information can be derived from various reconstruction intervals such as 40% and 70%.", 
    "5": "Decisions about chronic treatments during the perioperative period must be made at the presurgical anesthesia consultation. It is increasingly rare to stop treatment during this period, because: This new rule is applied particularly to patients with cardiovascular disorders. Beta blockers have a special role in preventing the onset of postoperative cardiovascular events. The role of statins requires further precision but they appear to fit into the same preventive approach. Interruption of antiplatelet agents appears to be associated with a risk of arterial thrombosis in patients with coronary conditions, notably those with conventional stents and most especially those with drug-eluting stents.", 
    "6": "The findings of sympathetic remodeling and its electrophysiological implications force us to rerecognize the drugs presently used. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of metoprolol on sympathetic remodeling and electrical remodeling at the infarcted border zone (IBZ) after myocardial infarction (MI).", 
    "7": "Forty rabbits were randomly assigned into two groups: MI group (n = 20), ligation of the anterior descending coronary; Metoprolol group (n = 20), ligation of the anterior descending coronary and administration of oral metoprolol 5 mg/kg/day. Eight weeks after surgery, transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) at baseline, TDR and difference of TDR (deltaTDR) during sympathetic nerve stimulation were measured at the IBZ. The distribution and densities of growth associated protein 43 and tyrosine hydroxylase positive nerves at the IBZ were detected with immunohistochemical techniques.", 
    "8": "The study was completed in the 36 surviving animals (18 rabbits in each group). The densities of growth associated protein 43 and tyrosine hydroxylase positive nerves in the Metoprolol group (2,550 +/- 554 and 1,779 +/- 458 microm2/mm2, respectively) were lower than in the MI group (3,217 +/- 589 and 2,616 +/- 528 microm2/mm2, respectively; both p < 0.01). TDR at baseline, TDR and deltaTDR during sympathetic nerve stimulation were shorter in the Metoprolol group than in the MI group (p < 0.01 for all).", 
    "9": "Metoprolol can inhibit sympathetic remodeling and electrical remodeling at the IBZ after MI. The association of metoprolol with improved electrical remodeling may be partly related to the inhibition of sympathetic remodeling.", 
    "10": "An increasing body of evidence suggests that cytokines may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Immunopharmacological studies provide new information on immunomodulating activity of some drugs, including their effect on the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of the present study was to find out whether amlodipine and atenolol, drugs applied in the treatment of arterial hypertension, can modulate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine level (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The experiments were performed on 4 groups of animals as follows: WKY + MET(control Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats), SHR + MET(control hypertensive rats), SHR + AML(hypertensive rats receiving amlodipine), SHR + AT (hypertensive rats receiving atenolol). Control rats received 1% solution of methylcellulose (1 ml/kg) by a gavage. Amlodipine and atenolol were administered by a gavage at doses of 15 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, respectively. Arterial blood pressure was measured in conscious rats, using the tail-cuff method. Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 concentrations were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Additionally, lipid levels were evaluated. The present data provide the evidence that amlodipine and atenolol act as immunomodulators of pro-inflammatory cytokines in SHR. Amlodipine decreased TNF-alpha, increased IL-6 and did not affect IL-1 level. Atenolol did not influence TNF-alpha and IL-1, but raised IL-6 in SHR. Additionally, amlodipine decreased total cholesterol level without changing HDL cholesterol level whereas atenolol did not influence lipid levels. The identification of additional immunomodulating properties of hypotensive drugs may be important for better understanding of their mechanisms of action.", 
    "11": "Hypertension remains one of the primary causes of preventable death in developed countries. Universally accepted clinical practice guidelines based on well designed trials are needed to ensure standardized treatment for these patients. It has been hypothesized that agents such as calcium channel antagonists and ACE inhibitors may be more effective than beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blocker)- or diuretic-based regimens. However, until recently, there have been limited data on the efficacy of 'newer' antihypertensive regimens, particularly combination therapy, relative to standard therapeutic options. The ASCOT-BPLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm), a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in >19 250 patients with hypertension, highlights the benefit of a combined amlodipine plus perindopril regimen over an atenolol plus diuretic-based combination in terms of significant reductions (p < 0.05) in all-cause mortality, total cardiovascular events and procedures, and fatal and nonfatal stroke. The ASCOT-BPLA trial underlines the cardiovascular benefit of ACE inhibitors, specifically perindopril, beyond that provided by BP reduction, and potentially reflects a mechanistic feature of the ACE inhibitors. It also suggests that the combination of amlodipine plus perindopril may provide broad-spectrum cardiovascular protection, as well as reduce the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus and renal impairment, in addition to its efficacy in lowering BP. The ASCOT-BPLA trial provides evidence of the need to reconsider traditional prescribing recommendations in patients with hypertension, particularly conclusions reached in the US after the publication of the ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) study. The recently published National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK emphasize the efficacy of ACE inhibitors as first-line agents for hypertensive patients <55 years of age and recommend ACE inhibitor therapy at any stage of hypertension management.", 
    "12": "Although in the developed world the incidence of and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke have been declining over the last 15 years, heart failure is increasing in incidence, prevalence and overall mortality, despite advances in the diagnosis and management of the condition. Hypertension, alone or in combination with CHD, precedes the development of heart failure in the majority of both men and women. Whilst there have been improvements in the overall management of hypertension, as reflected in rates of diagnosis, awareness, treatment and control of blood pressure (BP), there are still many patients with hypertension who remain undiagnosed or untreated and of those who do receive treatment many fail to achieve current targets for BP control. Placebo-controlled trials in hypertension, largely based on diuretic and beta-blocker-based regimens, have unequivocally demonstrated that the treatment of hypertension can significantly reduce the incidence of heart failure. Newer treatment strategies offer theoretical and proven practical advantages over established antihypertensive therapy. In particular, AT1-receptor blockers appear to provide benefits beyond BP control and are effective in the treatment of both hypertension and heart failure. Thus, the primary prevention of heart failure in hypertensive patients should be based upon strategies that provide tight and sustained BP control necessitating the use of multiple drugs. However, there is now compelling evidence to suggest that this therapy should include an antihypertensive agent that inhibits the reninangiotensin- aldosterone system (RAAS).", 
    "13": "A joint initiative between the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) has led to the publication of new guidelines for the management of hypertension in the community. Recent trial evidence highlighting the increased incidence of new-onset diabetes in those exposed to beta-blocker-based treatment regimens, with or without diuretics, compared with those based on calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-Is) inhibitors has led to a recommendation that in the uncomplicated patient, beta-blockers are no longer considered suitable options for first-line therapy. Together with mounting evidence that age and ethnicity dictate blood pressure (BP) responsiveness to different classes of antihypertensive drugs, the ACD algorithm is now proposed (formerly ABCD), with ACE inhibitors (ACE-Is) (or angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs] when ACE-Is are poorly tolerated) preferred in younger patients and CCBs or diuretics preferred for older patients and in black patients of any age. Pathophysiological considerations have influenced proposals for combination therapies with CCBs or diuretics added to ACE-Is in younger patients and vice versa in older patients. Health economic analyses have clearly indicated the cost effectiveness of CCBs which are now elevated to equal standing with diuretics in older patients.", 
    "14": "Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is increasingly attracting more scientific and public interest, and represents a poorly investigated issue in patients with essential hypertension. We evaluated the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in hypertensive women compared with normotensive women according to age, hypertension severity, hypertension duration, and antihypertensive treatment.", 
    "15": "The study population consisted of consecutive, sexually active women attending an outpatient hypertension clinic. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI questionnaire) was used to evaluate FSD. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate predictors of FSD.", 
    "16": "Four hundred and seventeen women were studied. From them, 216 women had arterial hypertension (136 treated, 80 untreated) and 201 were normotensive. Sexual dysfunction was found in 42.1% of hypertensive women compared with 19.4% of normotensive women (odds ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-4.7; P < 0.001). Systolic blood pressure levels were significantly related to FSFI score (r = -0.67, P < 0.001). Successful control of hypertension was related to lower prevalence of FSD. Increasing age (beta = -0.187, P = 0.001), increasing systolic blood pressure (beta = -0.687, P < 0.001), and beta-blocker administration (beta = -0.162, P = 0.001) were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction in this patient population.", 
    "17": "FSD is more prevalent in women with essential hypertension compared with women with normal blood pressure, and its prevalence declines with adequate blood pressure control. Adequate control of hypertension with medication not affecting sexual function can have a great impact on the quality of life of hypertensive patients. Physicians should recognize and properly manage FSD in hypertensive women.", 
    "18": "For assessment of the independent renoprotective effect of BP control and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy, the relationships of baseline BP, BP reduction, and follow-up BP with the incidence of persistent microalbuminuria were evaluated in 1204 hypertensive patients who had type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria and were included in the BErgamo Nephrologic Diabetic Complications Trial (BENEDICT) study and were randomly assigned to 3.6 yr of treatment with the ACEi trandolapril (2 mg/d), the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (ndCCB) verapamil SR (240 mg/d), their fixed combination Veratran (trandolapril 2 mg/d plus verapamil SR 180 mg/d), or placebo, plus other antihypertensive medications targeted at systolic/diastolic BP <130/80 mmHg. Follow-up (from month 3 to study end) systolic, diastolic, mean, and pulse BP and their reductions versus baseline--but not baseline BP--independently predicted (P < 0.001) the risk for microalbuminuria. In patients with follow-up BP above medians, ACEi significantly reduced the risk for microalbuminuria to levels that were observed among patients with BP below medians, regardless of ACEi treatment. The same trend was observed among patients with BP reductions below medians. ndCCB therapy did not independently affect microalbuminuria. Patients who were on Veratran had lower BP and less frequently received diuretics, beta blockers, or dihydropyridine dCCB. In hypertensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, BP reduction and ACEi therapy both independently may prevent microalbuminuria. ACEi therapy is particularly effective when BP is poorly controlled, whereas ndCCB therapy is ineffective at any level of achieved BP. As compared with trandolapril, Veratran may help with achievement of target BP with less need for concomitant antihypertensive medications.", 
    "19": "The alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) has relatively low expression in the CNS, but is increased in vivo following 48 h administration of the GABA-modulatory steroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one (THP or [allo]pregnanolone) to female rats. The purpose of the following study was to determine the optimal conditions for steroid-induced upregulation of alpha4 expression in an in vitro model. To this end, we used the IMR-32 cell, a neuroblastoma cell line, which normally expresses alpha4 mRNA at low levels. In undifferentiated IMR-32 cells, 48 h administration of THP increased alpha4 expression when ambient THP levels were reduced by the 5alpha-reductase blocker 4MA, suggesting that the background steroid milieu affects steroid regulation of this subunit. Following neuronal differentiation in serum-free medium, 48 h THP treatment significantly increased alpha4 expression two-fold following application of nerve growth factor (NGF) suggesting that development of neuronal processes facilitates this effect of the steroid. In the absence of NGF treatment, combined administration of 17beta-estradiol (E2) plus THP also increased alpha4 expression to a similar extent as THP following NGF treatment. In addition, E2 alone effectively increased alpha4 expression to maximal levels following NGF treatment. In contrast, neuronal differentiation in the absence of serum deprivation did not increase alpha4 levels. These results suggest that both THP and E2 can increase expression of the GABAR alpha4 subunit, but that this effect is dependent upon the background steroid milieu as well as the degree of neuronal development. These findings demonstrate optimal conditions for steroid-induced upregulation of the alpha4 subunit in an in vitro system.", 
    "20": "Nitric oxide (NO) is cytoprotective to certain types of neuronal cells. The neuroprotective ability of NO in the retina was reportedly mediated by the cyclic GMP (cGMP) to protein kinase G (PKG) pathway. Cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) plays an essential role in the NO/cGMP/PKG-mediated survival of rat cerebellar granule cells. We tested whether CREB transduces the NO/cGMP/PKG anti-apoptotic cascade in R28 neuro-glial progenitor cells. Apoptosis was induced in R28 cells by serum deprivation for 24 h. Varying concentrations of two NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and nipradilol, were added to medium with or without an NO scavenger, a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, or a PKG inhibitor. The cells were immunostained against activated caspase-3 and counterstained with Hoechst 33258. Apoptosis was quantified by counting activated caspase-3 positive or pyknotic cells. SNP and nipradilol rescued R28 cells from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, at an optimal concentration of 1.0 microM and 10 microM, respectively. Higher concentrations were cytotoxic. The NO scavenger and the inhibitors decreased the anti-apoptotic effect of the NO donors. Intracellular cGMP levels were increased after exposure to SNP and nipradilol. Western blotting showed that both NO donors increased CREB phosphorylation, which was blocked when pre-exposed to the inhibitors. Transfection with a dominant negative CREB construct defective of phosphorylation at Ser-133 interfered with the anti-apoptotic activity of SNP. These results indicate that CREB at least in part mediates the cGMP/PKG-dependent anti-apoptotic signal induced by NO in R28 cells.",

If DBP > 90 mm Hg at 4 weeks, Lodoz (5 mg/6.25 mg/day) was given for another 8 weeks. Clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed at the end of placebo run-in period and at 4 and 8 weeks.",

    "25": "The evolution of arrhythmologic technology introduced new therapeutic opportunities for cardiology patients. Competence, continuity of care, integration and collaboration between medical doctors and nurses allow a safe management of short and long term complications. A typical example of a new arrhythmic complication is the \"electrical storm\" or \"arrhythmic warm up\" in patients implanted with a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The definition and epidemiology of the electrical storm stress the relevance of this clinical situation; its dramatic emergency involves several aspects of nursing care, clinical, prognostic, ethical and deontological. The definition and implementation of an integrated protocol for the treatment of this condition is described and ethical and unresolved questions are rised. One of these problems is the recommendation to offer the patient the opportunity to receive information about the option of inactivating the ICD.", 
    "26": "Recent studies using ovarian cancer cells have shown that the catecholamine hormones norepinephrine (norepi) and epinephrine (epi) may influence cancer progression by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The purpose of this study is to determine if the stress hormone norepi can influence the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) tumors by using three NPC tumor cell lines. The NPC cell lines HONE-1, HNE-1, and CNE-1 were treated with norepi. The effects of norepi on MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF synthesis were measured by ELISA; functional MMP activity was measured by the invasive potential of the cells using a membrane invasion culture system whereas functional activity of VEGF was analyzed using a human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation assay. Norepi treatment increased MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF levels in culture supernatants of HONE-1 cells, which could be inhibited by the beta-blocker propranolol. Norepi induced the invasiveness of all NPC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked by CMT-3, an MMP inhibitor, and propranolol. Norepi stimulated the release of functional angiogenic VEGF by HONE-1 cells as well. Finally, HONE-1 cells were shown to express beta-adrenergic receptors as did seven of seven NPC biopsies examined. The data suggest that catecholamine hormones produced by the sympathetic-adrenal medullary axis may affect NPC tumor progression, in part, through modulation of key angiogenic cytokines.", 
    "27": "Alpha-methyl-5-HT is widely used as a high-affinity 5-HT(2) receptors agonist, though some studies have postulated that this drug also activates other serotonergic receptors. In the present work, we found that a wide range of concentrations of alpha-methyl-5-HT induced biphasic responses (contraction followed by relaxation) in guinea pig tracheal rings. The relaxing phase caused by 32microM alpha-methyl-5-HT was blocked by 0.1microM propranolol. Furthermore, during an ongoing histamine-induced contraction, alpha-methyl-5-HT (0.1-100microM) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation starting at 10microM. This relaxation was fully abolished by 0.1microM propranolol or 1microM ICI 118,551 (a selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist). Additionally, in electrophysiological recordings, 32microM alpha-methyl-5-HT also enhanced the membrane K(+) currents of single tracheal myocytes, an effect reverted by propranolol and ICI 118,551, and mimicked by 0.1microM salbutamol. Thus, we concluded that alpha-methyl-5-HT activates beta(2)-adrenoceptors in guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle at concentrations >or=10microM. This effect must be taken into account when this drug is used in airway smooth muscle and in other tissues expressing beta(2)-adrenoceptors.", 
    "28": "The aim of this study was to provide preliminary validation of a new sublingual mucosal cell line (HO-1-u-1) for use as in vitro sublingual drug delivery screening of compounds involving passive diffusion. HO-1-u-1 cells were seeded on cell culture inserts. The ultrastructure and integrity of cell layers, inter-passage variation and directionality of drug transport, and apparent permeability coefficient (P(app)) of eight beta-blockers (representing compounds involving passive diffusion) were determined. HO-1-u-1 cells grown on inserts formed stratified and epithelial-like structure and maintained the typical histological features of normal human sublingual epithelium. The maximal integrity of the cell layer was reached in 23 days. No significant inter-passage variation was found at the passages ranging from 2 to 11 when measured by radiolabeled transcellular and paracellular markers (testosterone and mannitol, respectively). Bidirectional transport studies confirmed the passive diffusion as the mechanism of transport for these markers. The P(app) of eight beta-blockers across HO-1-u-1 cell culture ranged from 2.89+/-0.17 to 6.37+/-0.37x10(-6)cm/s and correlated well to the P(app) obtained from porcine sublingual mucosa (r(2)=0.647 and 0.83 when excluding propranolol). The above results indicate that the HO-1-u-1 cells grown on inserts may offer as a potentially in vitro model for screening sublingual drug permeation involving passive diffusion.",

    "35": "Thirty patients with CCF (mean age 64.5 +/- 9.5 years) received beta-blockers (n = 10, atenolol in a dose 50.0 +/- 23.2 mg/day or metoprolol in a dose 45.0 +/- 20.9 mg/day), verapamil (n = 10, 192.0 +/- 83.9 mg/day) and diltiazem (n = 10, 286.6 +/- 107.2 mg/day). The patients were studied with Holter ECG monitoring (Schiller MT-100, Switzerland) and high resolution ECG (electrocardioanalyser Cardis, Geolink-electronics, RF) with construction of periodograms of ff waves and interval histograms RR (IHrr), estimation of the rhythm variability (SDRR, rMSSD, PNN50).", 
    "36": "Beta-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol), verapamil and diltiazem had no significant effect on the period of ff waves. The degree of a mean heart rate lowering decreased in the following order: beta-blockers-verapamil-diltiazem (30.1 +/- 12.5, 25.0 +/- 18.8 and 22.0 +/- 23.6 beat/min, differences are insignificant), this corresponded to the degree of Rrmin increase (0.12 +/- 0.04, 0.08 +/- 0.07 and 0.07-0.08). In CCF the inhibiting effect of beta-blockers and verapamil is substrate-dependent: the shorter baseline Rrmin (and higher heart rate), the more potent is the effect due to action of beta-blockers and verapamil (r = -0.58 and r = -0.57, p < 0.05) and reduction of a mean heart rate (r = -0.74 and r = -0.84, p < 0.05). Dependence of diltiazem effect on initial Rrmin is inverse. In contrast to Ca antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem), beta-blockers increased latent conduction manifesting in a significant rise of Rrmax, range of RR intervals (the difference between Rrmax and Rrmin) and in increased latent conduction (Rrmax/Rrmin) by 0.4 versus 0 and 0.1 in the groups on verapamil and diltiazem). In addition to insufficient shift RRmod, there appeared non-optimal rhythm structure--combination of a large number of short and long RR in small number of middle ones. Verapamil and diltiazem improved the rhythm pattern due to proportional increase of RRmin shift RRmod (r = 0.72 and r = 0.71, p < 0.05) and absence of a distinct effect on latent conduction. The between groups differences by SDRR, RMSSD and PNN50 dynamics were insignificant. Diltiazem in doses 360-480 mg/ day moderately increased latent conduction, but was low effective in the presence of early peak RR (0.28-0.46 s).",

Thus, heart rate control is an important therapeutic strategy in coronary artery disease and, for example, chronic heart failure. The pacemaker current I(f) plays a central role in determining spontaneous activity of the sinus node. Ivabradine, a selective inhibitor of the I(f) channel, reduces heart rate without any effect on cardiac contractility and without lowering blood pressure. While beta-blockers remain the first choice for heart rate reduction, in cases of adverse effects ivabradine may be used to treat stable angina pectoris. Studies evaluating possible further uses, for example in heart failure or after acute myocardial infarction, are still warranted.", 
    "59": "Several QT correction (QTc) formulas have been used for assessing the QT liability of drugs. However, they are known to under- and over-correct the QT interval and tend to be specific to species and experimental conditions. The purpose of this study was to determine a suitable formula for halothane-anesthetized dogs highly sensitive to drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Twenty dogs were anesthetized with 1.5% halothane and the relationship between the QT and RR intervals were obtained by changing the heart rate under atrial pacing conditions. The QT interval was corrected for the RR interval by applying 4 published formulas (Bazett, Fridericia, Van de Water, and Matsunaga); Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT/RR(0.33)) showed the least slope and lowest R(2) value for the linear regression of QTc intervals against RR intervals, indicating that it dissociated changes in heart rate most effectively. An optimized formula (QTcX = QT/RR(0.3879)) is defined by analysis of covariance and represents a correction algorithm superior to Fridericia's formula. For both Fridericia's and the optimized formula, QT-prolonging drugs (d,l-sotalol, astemizole) showed QTc interval prolongation. A non-QT-prolonging drug (d,l-propranolol) failed to prolong the QTc interval. In addition, drug-induced changes in QTcF and QTcX intervals were highly correlated with those of the QT interval paced at a cycle length of 500 msec. These findings suggest that Fridericia's and the optimized formula, although the optimized is a little bit better, are suitable for correcting the QT interval in halothane-anesthetized dogs and help to evaluate the potential QT prolongation of drugs with high accuracy.",

Carvedilol (CAR), a sparingly water-soluble antihypertensive drug, was selected as a model for the study. As first, we attempted to improve CAR apparent solubility by association with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) and then incorporated CAR/HPbetaCD binary systems in sustained-release tablets made of poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO). Solid CAR/HPbetaCD binary systems were prepared by physical mixing, kneading, co-melting and freeze-drying methods and characterized by DSC and X-ray powder diffractometry. The amount of CAR dissolved from all the HPbetaCD-containing systems was higher than pure CAR, the co-molten and freeze-dried products showing the best dissolution performance. The incorporation of the binary systems in PEO tablets resulted in a CAR release rate much higher than tablets containing only CAR. It was found that the time necessary to achieve complete release from the tablet was linearly related to the dissolution parameters of CAR/HPbetaCD powders. In the case of co-molten and freeze-dried products, all CAR content could be released in about 12 and 10 h, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of drug/cyclodextrin solid systems in erodable PEO matrices intended for the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs is useful to modulate the release rate by controlling the dissolution properties of the drug inside the tablet.",

The octanol/ water partition coefficient (PC(O/W)) and the aqueous humor concentration in rabbits after instillation of carteolol containing fatty acids having not more than 6 carbons were measured. The longer carbon chain fatty acid showed the higher PC(O/W) of carteolol. The aqueous humor concentration of carteolol increased with carbon chain length of fatty acid and was clearly correlated with logPC(O/W). The increment of counter ion also increased both the logPC(O/W) and aqueous humor concentration of carteolol. The findings suggested that the transcorneal absorption of carteolol would be designed by coordinating with quality and quantity of counter ions. The area under concentration (AUC) in aqueous humor applied by ion pair formulation containing 2% carteolol with sorbate was 2.6 times higher than that by 2% carteolol ophthalmic solution (control), whereas the AUC applied by 4% carteolol ophthalmic solution was 1.4 times higher.

Agglomeration was induced by triboelectrification of the particles during mixing, and it was evaluated as a method to achieve controlled drug release rate. These agglomerates, mixed with different amounts of a disintegrant, were compressed into tablets whose dissolution characteristics were determined. Triboelectric measurements showed that when the drugs were in contact with SS, charges of the opposite polarity were generated to SA (+) and caffeine and NAG (-) promoting adhesion. Instead, propranolol HCl was charged with the same polarity as SA. SEM micrographs showed that smaller caffeine particles, in spite of their larger negative charge, agglomerated less efficiently with SA than larger NAG particles. This emphasizes the importance of particle size in the agglomeration process. Propranolol HCl did not form agglomerates with SA since their particle sizes and charges were identical. As a result, agglomeration of powders prior to tablet compression allows for modification and control of the release rate of the drugs from the SA matrix tablets as well as the tensile strength of the tablets.",

In fact, carotid atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness are both related to risk factors associated with the occurrence of stroke. In addition, several cross-sectional studies have shown that risk factors associated with the occurrence of stroke have been correlated with carotid atherosclerosis development and progression and with increased arterial stiffness. Some studies have also shown that aortic stiffness is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in the carotid and in other vascular beds. More importantly, longitudinal studies have demonstrated that carotid atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness are independent predictors of stroke (and other cardiovascular events). Interventional studies have demonstrated that treatment with statins, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and insulin sensitizers may be particularly effective on slowing the progression or favoring the regression of atherosclerotic changes, and may reduce large artery stiffness. It remains to be proven, in large prospective studies, whether the regression of increased arterial stiffness or of carotid intima-media thickness and plaque have a prognostic significance, i.e. are associated with a reduction of the risk of cerebrovascular events.", 
    "92": "Large artery stiffening may be both a cause and a consequence of atherosclerosis and is independently related to coronary outcome. This relationship is likely to be causal given the unfavourable effect of large artery stiffening on coronary hemodynamics. There is clear experimental and clinical evidence that large artery stiffening promotes myocardial ischemia secondary to central pulse pressure elevation. Many agents commonly used to treat ischemic heart disease symptoms also reduce large artery stiffness, through both functional and structural mechanisms. Such effects likely contribute to the anti-ischemic actions of these drugs. However, it remains to be elucidated whether agents specifically targeted to reduce large artery stiffness provide ischemic protection in the setting of coronary disease.",

    "94": "Atrial myocytes were obtained from consenting patients in sinus rhythm, just prior to CS. Action potentials and ion currents were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Post-CS AF occurred in 53 of 212 patients (25%). Those with post-CS AF were older than those without (67 +/- 2 vs 62 +/- 1 years, P = 0.005). In cells from patients with post-CS AF, the action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization, maximum upstroke velocity, and effective refractory period (ERP) were 13 +/- 4 ms, 217 +/- 16 ms, 185 +/- 10 V/s, and 216 +/- 14 ms, respectively (n = 30 cells, 11 patients).

None of these values were significantly different in cells from patients without post-CS AF (P > 0.05 for each, 60-279 cells, 29-86 patients), confirmed by multiple and logistic regression. In patients treated >7 days with a beta-blocker pre-CS, the incidence of post-CS AF was lower than in non-beta-blocked patients (13% vs 27%, P = 0.038).

During a 48h exposure to a very high concentration of propranolol (70.9\u03bcg/L) no effects on heart rate were found. After a subsequent intravenous injection of propranolol, heart rate remained unaffected in pre-exposed fish but was significantly lowered in na\u00efve fish. Other studies have reported effects on the reproduction of fish by propranolol dissolved in water at much lower concentrations.

To start with, a simple trabeculectomy can be augmented by a deep sclerectomy, concentrated Mitomycin C application and iridencleisis. This surgical alternative starts with an \"L\" shaped conjunctival flap, followed by a superficial scleral flap, then by a deep scleral flap in which bed, Mitomycin C is applied. A trabeculectomy is then performed in the deep sclerectomy. The iris is prolapsed followed by a horseshoe iridotomy in order to suture it in the deep sclerectomy. The scleral flap is tightly sutured and the anterior chamber is filled with viscelastic material. The postoperative treatment consists of topical steroids until the IOP reaches 14mmHg; by then NSAIDs are used for several weeks. If needed, a beta-blocker or acetazolamide can be used during the hypertensive period.", 
    "102": "The effect of renal failure on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bisoprolol was investigated in bilateral ureter-ligated (BUL) rats. The blood bisoprolol concentrations following 30-min intravenous infusion at a rate of 60 microg/kg/min were higher in renal artery-occluded (RAO) rats than in control rats, and were higher in BUL rats than in RAO rats. Increased blood bisoprolol concentrations accompanied decreased mean systemic clearances: 50.7, 36.4, and 26.2 mL/min/kg in control, RAO, and BUL rats, respectively. The finding indicated that approximately 30% of administered bisoprolol was excreted via the kidney, and that not only the renal clearance but also non-renal clearance of bisoprolol was decreased in BUL rats. The beta-blocking action of bisoprolol was assessed by the reduction in isoproterenol-induced increases in the heart rate. The relationship between blood concentration and the beta-blocking action of bisoprolol in BUL rats was similar to that in control rats. These results suggested that renal excretion and hepatic metabolism of bisoprolol were significantly reduced in BUL rats, but that pharmacodynamics of bisoprolol was not altered by acute renal failure.", 
    "103": "beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) coexist in different regions of the heart. The beta(2)/beta(1) expression ratio is higher in the sinoatrial node (SAN) than in atria and ventricles, but the specific contribution of either type of receptor to rate modulation is still not well established. We have recently demonstrated that pacemaker (\"funny\") f-channels are located in lipid rafts of the rabbit SAN. Since in ventricular myocytes beta(2)-, but not beta(1)-ARs, localize to caveolae, we hypothesized that modulation of f-channels and of pacemaker activity in SAN myocytes is controlled mainly by beta(2)-AR activation. To address this point, we investigated the caveolar localization of proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry, and found that f-channels interact with caveolin 3. We also recorded I(f) current and spontaneous activity from SAN myocytes, and found that beta-AR activation by the non-selective agonists isoproterenol and fenoterol shifted the I(f) activation curve similarly (by 6.3 and 5.3 mV) and increased similarly spontaneous rate (by 23.1% and 21.6%, respectively). Specific beta(2) stimulation had similar effects (4.9 mV shift of the activation curve and 16.9% rate increase), but specific beta(1) stimulation was less effective (1.7 mV shift and 7.2% rate increase). However, after caveolar disorganization by MbetaCD (2%), stimulation of beta(1)-ARs was as effective as non-specific beta-AR stimulation. These data show that specific stimulation of beta(2)-ARs is the main mechanism by which heart rate is modulated through a positive shift of the I(f) activation curve and that this mechanism requires specific membrane compartmentation.",

Catecholamines are well known to act through both beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors (ARs), which mediate their effects through distinct receptor pathways. Beta-AR blockers are commonly used in the treatment of HF and have distinct receptor affinity profiles. The recent COMET trial comparing 2 important beta-blocking drugs showed a distinct advantage for carvedilol in decreasing the risk of mortality from HF. The mechanism of action for carvedilol differs from metoprolol tartrate in its ability to block both alpha- and beta-ARs, leading to renewed interest in the potential role of alpha-ARs in the progression of HF. In contrast, however, the ALLHAT study discontinued use of doxazosin, an alpha1-receptor blocker because of an increase in cardiovascular events among patients using this drug. The results of these studies appear to be in contrast with respect to the role of alpha-ARs in regards to cardiovascular pathophysiology. Further study of the alpha-receptor and understanding the role of alpha-ARs in HF is necessary to understand the therapeutic effect of alpha-blockade.

Cocaine's principal effects on the cardiovascular system are mediated via alpha-adrenergic stimulation and include (a) an increase in the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate and systemic arterial pressure) and (b) a concomitant decrease in myocardial oxygen supply (caused by vasoconstriction of the epicardial coronary arteries). Cocaine-induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction is enhanced at sites of atherosclerotic narrowing. Delayed or recurrent vasoconstriction of the coronary arteries may occur hours after the serum cocaine concentration has declined and appears to be caused by cocaine's major metabolites. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate cocaine-induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction, thereby increasing the magnitude of myocardial ischemia.

After 1 year, blood pressure was comparably reduced by 32/14 and 27/13 mmHg, respectively, in the losartan and atenolol groups, but the atenolol group had higher mean LV mass index (118 vs 103 g/m2) and lower LV ejection fraction (61% vs 67%) and midwall shortening (15.8% vs 16.8%) (all p<0.05). Resting diastolic Doppler indices remained unchanged and did not differ between the groups. Peak oxygen uptake during exercise was virtually unchanged after 1 year and did not differ between the groups in spite of a lower peak exercise heart rate in atenolol-treated patients. In multivariate analysis, higher peak oxygen uptake at 1 year was associated with lower body mass index, and higher systolic blood pressure and shorter isovolumic relaxation time at peak exercise (multiple R2 = 0.51, p<0.01), while age, gender, heart rate increase during exercise, reduction in LV mass and study treatment did not enter. In conclusion, reduction in blood pressure and LV mass induced by losartan or atenolol treatment was not accompanied by improved exercise capacity after 1 year.

However, there is a paucity of data on the incidence of and risk factors for LV remodeling in modern clinical practice that incorporates widespread use of acute reperfusion strategies and almost systematic use of \"antiremodeling\" medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. We enrolled 266 patients with anterior wall Q-wave AMI who had >or=3 segments of the infarct zone that were akinetic on echocardiography before discharge. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed 3 months and 1 year after AMI. LV volumes, ejection fraction, wall motion score index, and mitral flow velocities were determined in a blinded analysis at a core echocardiographic laboratory. Acute reperfusion was attempted in 220 patients (83%; primary angioplasty in 29% and thrombolysis in 54%). During hospitalization, 99% of patients underwent coronary angiography and 87% underwent coronary stenting of the infarct-related lesion. At 1 year, 95% of patients received an antiplatelet agent, 89% a beta blocker, 93% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, and 93% a statin. Echocardiographic follow-up was obtained in 215 patients. There was recovery in LV systolic function as shown by a decrease in wall motion score index and an increase in ejection fraction. There was a significant increase in end-diastolic volume (EDV; 56.4 +/- 14.7 ml/m2 at baseline, 59.3 +/- 15.7 ml/m2 at 3 months, 62.8 +/- 18.7 ml/m2 at 1 year, p <0.0001). LV remodeling (>20% increase in EDV) was observed in 67 patients (31%). Peak creatine kinase level, systolic blood pressure, and wall motion score index were independently associated with changes in EDV. In conclusion, recent improvements in AMI management do not abolish LV remodeling, which remains a relatively frequent event after an initial anterior wall AMI.",

In addition to obtaining individualized maximum a posteriori Bayesian post hoc parameter estimates, the subpopulation to which an individual was classified can be determined. However, the accuracy of the classification of subjects to subpopulations is not well studied. We investigated the impact of several factors on the accuracy of classification in mixture models applied to pharmacokinetics using a simulation strategy. The availability of actual subject data allowed us to evaluate mixture model classification in a potentially common application, namely, the classification of clearance into poor metabolizer (PM) or extensive metabolizer (EM) subgroups with the known phenotype status in subjects receiving metoprolol. The factors explored in the simulation study were the magnitude of difference between the clearances in two subpopulations, the between subject variability in clearance, the mixing-fraction, and the population sample size. Populations were simulated at various levels of the above factors and analyzed with a mixture model using NONMEM. The population pharmacokinetics of metoprolol were modeled with the EM/PM phenotype as a known covariate, and without the phenotype covariate using a mixture model. Within the range of scenarios studied, the proportion of subjects classified into the correct subpopulation was high. The simulation-estimation study suggests that a greater separation between two subpopulations, a smaller variability in the parameter distribution, a larger sample size, and a smaller size subpopulation tend to be associated with a greater accuracy of subpopulation classification when a mixture model is applied to pharmacokinetic data. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of metoprolol, a drug that undergoes polymorphic metabolism, it was possible to correctly identify phenotype status using a mixture model.",

    "210": "Smokers reported higher anxiety levels than nonsmokers reported on both anxiety scales. Female smokers reported the highest anxiety and peak pain levels of all, yet women were the least likely to receive anxiolytic agents. Smoking status was not a predictor for anxiety level when sex, peak pain, use of beta-blockers in the hospital, and age were controlled for. However, smokers were twice as likely as nonsmokers to receive an anxiolytic agent and 60% more likely to receive a beta-blocker in the emergency department, and smokers were 80% more likely than nonsmokers to receive an anxiolytic agent during hospitalization when these variables were controlled.",

    "213": "The impact of neurohormonal blockade on the association between BMI and mortality was examined in 5548 patients following AMI (CONSENSUS II), 50% receiving enalapril and 7% beta-blockade, and in 4367 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (4S), 79% with prior AMI, 12% receiving ACEi and 67% beta-blockade. Median follow-up was 0.4 and 5.2 years, respectively. Patients were categorized into 4 BMI groups: Underweight, < 22.00; normal-weight, 22.00-24.99; overweight, 25.00-29.99; obese, > or = 30.00 kg/m2. Multivariable analysis adjusted for demographics, patient history, physical examination, biochemistry and medication.", 
    "214": "CONSENSUS II: Overall, adjusted mortality (n=301) risk was similar across BMI groups. Comparing overweight with normal-weight patients, the hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality differed significantly (P=0.028) between patients randomized to placebo (HR 1.41) and enalapril (HR 0.75). 4S: Overall, adjusted mortality (n=421) risk was similar for normal-weight, overweight and obese patients. In a time-dependent analysis for drug use, comparing obese with normal-weight patients, the HRs for mortality differed significantly (P=0.047) between patients without (HR 1.86) and those with (HR 0.97) neurohormonal blockade.", 
    "215": "In patients after AMI or with CAD, high BMI was associated with increased mortality risk among patients not receiving neurohormonal blockade, but with decreased or neutral mortality risk among those receiving neurohormonal blockade. Tests for interaction indicate that neurohormonal blockade may attenuate the relationship between high BMI and increased mortality risk. Neurohormonal blockade may thus partly explain the so-called obesity paradox.", 
    "216": "This paper reviews recent studies on the role of Nnt (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase) in insulin secretion and detoxification of ROS (reactive oxygen species). Glucose-stimulated insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells is mediated by increased metabolism. This elevates intracellular [ATP], thereby closing KATP channels (ATP-sensitive potassium channels) and producing membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx and, consequently, insulin secretion. The C57BL/6J mouse displays glucose intolerance and reduced insulin secretion, which results from a naturally occurring deletion in the Nnt gene. Transgenic expression of the wild-type Nnt gene in C57BL/6J mice rescues the phenotype. Knockdown of Nnt in the insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 with small interfering RNA dramatically reduced Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Similarly, mice carrying ENU (N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea)-induced loss-of-function mutations in Nnt were glucose intolerant and secreted less insulin during a glucose tolerance test. Islets isolated from these mice showed impaired insulin secretion in response to glucose, but not to the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide. This is explained by the fact that glucose failed to elevate ATP in Nnt mutant islets. Nnt is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein involved in detoxification of ROS. beta-Cells isolated from Nnt mutant mice showed increased ROS production on glucose stimulation. We hypothesize that Nnt mutations enhance glucose-dependent ROS production and thereby impair beta-cell mitochondrial metabolism, possibly via activation of uncoupling proteins. This reduces ATP production and lowers KATP channel activity. Consequently, glucose-dependent electrical activity and insulin secretion are impaired.", 
    "217": "The evidence for loss of Ca2+ homeostasis due to neuronal degeneration is considerable and rapidly increasing. In this study, we try to evaluate the protective effect of tetrandrine (TET), an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Radix Stephania tetrandrae S., on amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) induced cell death in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Both compounds reduced cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner after 72 h in culture. Cell proliferation in the presence of 20 microM Abeta or 0.4 mM MPTP was reduced to 58.3 +/- 4.9 or 54.9 +/- 5.5 %, respectively. TET (0.1, 0.5 and 1 microM) alone had no significant effect on cell survival; however, it prevented Abeta-induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, TET failed to counteract MPTP-induced cytotoxicity. Also, an L-type calcium channel blocker, nimodipine, solely reversed Abeta-induced cell death. On the other hand, ELISA determination of mono-/oligo-nucleosomes accumulation showed that the mode of cell death evoked by Abeta was necrosis while that evoked by MPTP was presumably apoptosis. These results suggest that TET may mitigate the harmful effects of Abeta on cell survival, probably by interfering via the necrotic signal related to Ca2+ overloading through the L-type calcium channel.", 
    "218": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a high risk of death from coronary artery disease and may modify the response to standard cardiovascular therapies. Treatment of subjects with CKD should ideally be based on evidence from randomized, clinical trials, but how often subjects with CKD have been excluded from these trials is uncertain. We undertook this study in order to quantify how often subjects with moderate to advanced CKD were excluded from large cardiovascular trials. MEDLINE and the reference list of selected articles were searched in order to identify large, randomized, controlled trials of five different coronary artery disease therapies published between 1998 and 2005. Exclusion criteria and reported clinical characteristics of subjects were abstracted. Rates of exclusion and reporting of baseline characteristics of study participants were compared for CKD, diabetes, history of smoking, and hypertension. Eighty-six trials randomizing 411 653 patients were identified. More than 80% of trials excluded subjects with end-stage renal disease and 75.0% excluded patients with CKD. Subjects with diabetes, hypertension, or a history of smoking were excluded less than 4% of the time. Baseline renal function of study participant was reported in only 7% of trials. Patients with CKD are frequently excluded from coronary artery disease trials and renal function of randomized subjects is rarely reported. These findings reinforce the notion that available data on the treatment of coronary artery disease in subjects with CKD have significant limitations and should be generalized to the treatment of subjects with CKD cautiously.", 
    "219": "The aim of this study was to evaluate whether curcumin could modulate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A expression, and in turn modify the pharmacokinetic profiles of P-gp and CYP3A substrates in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Intragastric gavage of the rats with 60 mg/kg curcumin for 4 consecutive days led to a down-regulation of the intestinal P-gp level. There was a concomitant upregulation of hepatic P-gp level, but the renal P-gp level was unaffected. Curcumin also attenuated the CYP3A level in the small intestine but induced CYP3A expression in the liver and kidney. Regular curcumin consumption also caused the C(max) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-8) and total AUC) of peroral celiprolol (a P-gp substrate with negligible cytochrome P450 metabolism) at 30 mg/kg to increase, but the apparent oral clearance (CL(oral)) of the drug was reduced. Similarly, rats treated with curcumin for 4 consecutive days showed higher AUC (AUC(0-4) and total AUC) and lower CL(oral) for peroral midazolam (a CYP3A substrate that does not interact with the P-gp) at 20 mg/kg in comparison with vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, curcumin administered 30 min before the respective drug treatments did not significantly modify the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drugs. Analysis of the data suggests that the changes in the pharmacokinetic profiles of peroral celiprolol and midazolam in the rat model were contributed mainly by the curcumin-mediated down-regulation of intestinal P-gp and CYP3A protein levels, respectively.",

N-terminal histidine-tagged gene constructs with optimized codon usage were designed so as to obtain Pichia pastoris transformants with a high expression level. The constructs were inserted into the pPIC9 vector, and then electroporated into the SMD1168 strains. The highest expression level obtained was about 4 mg/liter-culture broth. The dissociation constant of the receptor in the membrane fraction was 1.2 nM toward CGP-12177 antagonist. The receptor was solubilized with sucrose monolaurate and purified with a series of chromatography steps including anion-exchange, Ni-Sepharose, alprenolol-Agarose, and hydroxyapatite columns. The receptor was heterogeneously glycosylated, showing broad SDS-PAGE bands around 70-90 kDa. After endoglycosidase treatment, the receptor appeared as a single band around 45 kDa, and was further purified with hydroxyapatite and gel-filtration columns. The receptor was eluted as a sharp peak at the gel-filtration elution volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 117 kDa. The saccharide-trimmed receptor thus purified is homogeneous as analyzed with SDS-PAGE, shows the dissociation constant of 4.7 nM toward CGP-12177 antagonist, and is suitable for crystallization experiments.",

In all, 293 patients (91.6%) completed the study. The proportion of patients who reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) was 9.1%, which is not significantly different (P=.13) from the 5.9% observed during previous short-term (2-4 wk) treatment. Headache accounted for 80.6% of all drug-related AEs and required discontinuation of the drug in one quarter of patients who reported the symptom (ie, 1.9% of the 320 patients involved in the study). No serious drug-related AEs occurred during the study. Tolerability to molsidomine, evaluated with use of a visual analog scale (VAS), improved by 20% from beginning to end of 1-year follow-up. Two-by-two Bonferroni's comparisons were significant at the .05 level between the 2-month assessment and assessments performed at 8, 10, and 12 months. No age-time interaction was noted (P=.82). Heart rate, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and blood parameters showed no statistically significant or clinically relevant changes during the study. Compliance with treatment was satisfactory throughout the follow-up period. There was no significant change in the weekly frequency of anginal attacks and consumption of short-acting nitroderivatives during the 1-year study (P=.07 and P=.12,respectively), but their frequency was significantly (ie, approximately 50%) lower than during a preceding short-term treatment period (P<.0001 and P=.014, respectively). Subjective clinical status, evaluated through an appropriate VAS, improved by 38% from start to end of 1-year follow-up. Bonferroni's comparisons between baseline and subsequent 2-month evaluations were all significant at the .05 level. No age-time interaction could be seen for frequency of anginal attacks and consumption of short-acting nitroderivatives, nor for clinical status )P=.10, P=.11, and P=.51, respectively). Neither tolerability to molsidomine nor effectiveness of the drug was biased by concomitant antianginal therapies, insofar as none of these parameters showed a significant treatment type (ie, molsidomine administered as monotherapy or add-on therapy)-time interaction (VAS for tolerability: P=.44; angina: P=.39; nitroderivatives: P=.72; VAS for clinical status: P=.62). Molsidomine 16 mg QD administered for 1 y to patients with stable angina was well tolerated and remained effective during the entire treatment period, independent of age and concomitant antianginal therapy.", 
    "222": "Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) is a method to screen drug candidates for membrane permeability. The objective was to characterize the transport of a model weak base, metoprolol, across a three lipid-component PAMPA system (denoted A-PAMPA, for anionic-PAMPA) and challenge ion pairing as a mechanism for metoprolol transport. A-PAMPA was designed to mimic the lipid composition of the enterocyte's plasma membrane and included 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-l-serine] (PS18:1) as an anionic lipid-component. Metoprolol flux was measured across A-PAMPA, as well as across three other PAMPA systems. Permeability studies were conducted under various conditions, with varying pH, ionic strength, and presence/absence of competing cations. Permeabilities of mannitol and benzoic acid, as model neutral and anionic solutes, were also measured. PAMPA membrane fluidity was inferred from anisotropy measurements in liposomes. Ion pairing between metoprolol and PS18:1 was assessed via NMR. Metoprolol transport across A-PAMPA was dominated by an ion pair-mediated mechanism (i.e. metoprolol-PS18:1 complex), rather than a membrane fluidity-mediated mechanism. Compared to other PAMPA systems, metoprolol permeability across A-PAMPA and PS18:1 was high. Permeability and anisotropy values suggested PS18:1 selectively facilitated metoprolol transport, while neutral lipid did not. Additional studies supporting ion pairing of metoprolol across A-PAMPA showed that a) metoprolol transport was self-inhibited across A-PAMPA but not across neutral lipid PAMPA; b) competing cations reduced metoprolol permeability across A-PAMPA but not across neutral lipid PAMPA; and c) NMR spectrum of a mixture of metoprolol and PS18:1 showed a broadening of some metoprolol peaks, presumably due to metoprolol interaction with anionic lipid. Metoprolol transport across a three lipid-component PAMPA system that contained anionic lipid was facilitated by apparent ion pairing.",

    "227": "The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) has been proposed as a region playing a major role in the tonic and reflex control of sympathetic vasomotor activity and blood pressure. Pharmacological activation of GABA(A) receptors with muscimol in the RVLM of anesthetized rats results in a large fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and sympathetic activity. In this study we evaluated the effects of activation of GABA receptors in the RVLM of conscious, freely moving rats. Bilateral microinjections of muscimol into the RVLM of conscious rats produced a large fall in MAP (-38+/-4 mm Hg, n=7) when compared with saline injections (NaCl 0.9%, 7+/-1 mm Hg, n=4). The decrease in MAP evoked by muscimol was accompanied by a significant increase in HR (muscimol 69+/-13 bpm vs. vehicle -33+/-12 bpm, P<0.05), an effect that was completely abolished by beta1 adrenergic receptor blockade. Conversely, bilateral microinjections of GABA(B) agonist, baclofen, evoked a pressor response, but in this case, the increase was not significantly different from that evoked by vehicle injections. These results 1) indicate that GABA(A) receptors have a powerful influence on the resting activity of RVLM neurons in conscious rats; 2) indicate that a compensatory sympathetic-mediated tachycardia is present after inhibition of RVLM neurons in conscious rats; 3) confirm and extend previous findings showing that RVLM neurons are critical for blood pressure maintenance even in normal non-anesthetized conditions.",

    "234": "A supersensitivity of the beta-adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic response has been demonstrated in atria isolated from rats subjected to septic shock. Our study was undertaken to investigate whether bacterial endotoxin/LPS affects the increase in heart rate induced by beta-adrenoceptor agonists in the rat also in vivo. In pithed and vagotomized rats, the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (0.05-0.15 nmol/kg) and agonists at the high- and low-affinity state of beta1-adrenoceptors, that is, prenalterol (0.3-3 nmol/kg) and (+/-)-4-[3-[(1,1-dimethylethyl)amino]-2-hydroxypropoxy]-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzimidazole-2-one (CGP 12177; 3-6 nmol/kg), respectively, and at beta2-adrenoceptors, that is, fenoterol (1-5 nmol/kg), increased heart rate by 50 to 60 beats/min. Administration of LPS (0.4, 1, and 1.5 mg/kg), under continuous infusion of vasopressin, dose-dependently amplified the chronotropic response to isoprenaline, prenalterol, and fenoterol (by 80%, 50%, and 100%, respectively) but not to CGP 12177. The beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol (ICI 118551 0.1 mumol/kg) did not affect the chronotropic responses of isoprenaline, fenoterol, and prenalterol under non-endotoxic conditions, but abolished the potentiation of tachycardia produced by LPS (1.5 mg/kg). The beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist (+/-)-2-hydroxy-5-[2-[[2-hydroxy-3-[4-[1-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-phenoxy]propyl]-amino]ethoxy]-benzamide CGP 20712A; 0.1 mumol/kg almost completely reduced the chronotropic effects of isoprenaline, fenoterol, and prenalterol both in control rats and in animals exposed to LPS (1.5 mg/kg). We conclude that LPS sensitizes cardiac beta-adrenoceptors by recruiting functionally active beta2-adrenoceptors, but the amplification of tachycardia occurs only when both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors are concomitantly activated. The pithed rat may serve as a model to examine the beta-adrenoceptor supersensitivity in vivo."
