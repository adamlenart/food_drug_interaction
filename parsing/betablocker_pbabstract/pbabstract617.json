    "0": "The present experiments were designed to elucidate what mechanism(s) would be responsible for beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (beta-blockers)-induced pressor responses in rats. In urethane-anaesthetized rats, 6 beta-blockers at i.v. doses ranging from 0.3 to 300 micrograms/kg evoked the pressor response in a dose-dependent manner. The relative potency in causing the pressor action was correlated not to their beta 1-blocking activities (r = 0.374, P greater than 0.05) but to their beta 2-blocking ones (r = 0.856, P less than 0.05). In pithed or adrenalectomized rats with low levels of plasma catecholamines, however, propranolol failed to exert its sustained pressor action. Propranolol (300 micrograms/kg i.v.) distinctly potentiated the pressor responses not to noradrenaline but to adrenaline and to electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow (E.S.) in pithed rats. On the contrary, there was not any potentiation of pressor response to E.S. in pithed, adrenalectomized rats treated with propranolol (300 micrograms/kg i.v.). In rats treated with phenoxybenzamine (5 mg/kg i.v.), adrenaline was shown to have much more potent vasodilating action resulting from beta 2-stimulation than noradrenaline, the dose difference for causing the diastolic blood pressure decrease by a 25 mm Hg being almost 80 times. In pithed rats, infusion of adrenaline at the rate of 0.02 micrograms/min caused a significant increase in plasma adrenaline level from 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 0.45 +/- 0.048 ng/ml, being close to basal level obtained in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Under this situation, propranolol (1-100 micrograms/kg i.v.) showed a distinct pressor response in a dose-dependent fashion as observed in adrenal intact rats anaesthetized with urethane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The direct identification of beta adrenoceptors in endothelial cell cultures has not been possible until the advent of a new beta-adrenergic radioligand, [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP). Using [125I]ICYP, we report the successful identification of a beta adrenoceptor in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. At 37 degrees C, specific binding is saturable, stable and reversible. There is a single class of binding sites (21,500 +/- 2,900 sites/cell) with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 109 +/- 26 pM. The rate constant of association, k1, is 1.22 X 10(9) M-1 min-1 and of dissociation, k-1, is 0.01 min-1. Binding studies on monolayers of endothelial cells grown in microtiter plates yield similar data (Kd = 53 +/- 9 pM, Bmax = 20,000 +/- 1,900 sites/cell). Stereoselectivity of binding for the (-)-isomer is demonstrable for both agonists and antagonists. A series of adrenergic agonists competes with [125I]ICYP for binding with an order of potency suggesting beta 2 subselectivity ; isoproterenol (0.73 microM) greater than epinephrine (15 microM) greater than norepinephrine (71 microM). Furthermore, the beta 2 inhibitor butoxamine is more potent than the beta 1 inhibitor practolol (7.7 microM vs 22 microM respectively). The GTP analogue, Gpp(NH)p, reduces isoproterenol affinity to 1.9 microM and increases the Hill coefficient from 0.62-0.90.", 
    "2": "The results of a 3-month study of Befunolol eye drops 0.25% and 0.5% have already been published. The continuation of the study has shown that there is no diminution of the effect of the drug on IOP after a year of treatment. The absence of significant influences on pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, corneal sensitivity, tear production, pupil diameter, visual acuity or visual field, which was established within the first 12 weeks, was also confirmed after 12 months.", 
    "3": "A new stereospecific hplc method that is capable of simultaneously quantitating the S-(-)- and R-(+)-enantiomers of acebutolol and its major metabolite, diacetolol, in plasma and urine, is described. When applied to the assay of biological fluids collected during single and chronic oral dosing with acebutolol (Sectral), this procedure failed to reveal any important stereoselectivity in the disposition of either acebutolol or diacetolol in man. This may occur because acebutolol is metabolized by hydrolysis and N-acetylation, whereas the other beta-blockers which exhibit some degree of stereoselective disposition (e.g. metoprolol and propranolol) are primarily metabolized by oxidation.", 
    "4": "The past decade has seen the introduction of many new class 1 drugs, restricting fast inward current. Confirmative evidence has been obtained that the antiarrthymic action of lidocaine and diphenylhydantoin is indeed due to their effect as class 1 agents depressing conduction. The original class 3 drug, amiodarone, is increasingly in use as an antiarrhythmic of first choice for WPW and for arrhythmias associated with hypertrophic myopathy, and as a reserve drug in resistant arrhythmias of other types. Other compounds delaying repolarization have proved to be clinically effective as antiarrhythmics. In addition to their class 2 antiarrhythymic action exhibited acutely, on long-term treatment beta blockers have a class 3 action, which might be, at least in part, responsible for the protection of postinfarction patients against sudden death. Recent research suggests that inhibition of slow inward current may lead, as a secondary consequence of lowered [Ca]i, to improved cell-to-cell conduction. Finally, all but one of the new antiarrhythmic drugs, none of which existed in 1972, have turned out to possess one or more of the four classes of action originally described. This can hardly be a coincidence. The single exception, alinidine, a selective bradycardic agent, may restrict anionic currents, which would constitute a fifth class of action, but this is far from proved.", 
    "5": "Relaxant responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonists isoprenaline, fenoterol, noradrenaline or procaterol were obtained on isolated ring preparations of canine coronary arteries contracted with KCl (20 mM) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (3 microM). On left circumflex arterial preparations, Schild plots for the selective antagonists atenolol (beta 1-selective) or ICI 118,551 (beta 2-selective), when using noradrenaline or fenoterol as agonist, were superimposed. This suggested that only one subtype of beta-adrenoceptor was involved in the responses. The pA2 values on left circumflex artery preparations were: atenolol, noradrenaline as agonist 6.98, fenoterol as agonist 6.71; ICI 118, 551, noradrenaline as agonist 6.66, fenoterol as agonist 7.04. These data indicated that the beta-adrenoceptor subtype was beta 1. The relative potencies of isoprenaline: noradrenaline: fenoterol were left circumflex 100: 10.0: 2.3, left ventricular branch 100: 9.7: 2.0, septal branch 100: 10.9: 2.5. These data confirmed that beta 1-adrenoceptors were involved in the responses of all three arterial preparations. On preparations of left circumflex artery, left ventricular branch and septal branch, responses were obtained to high concentrations (1 to 100 microM) but not to low concentrations (0.001 to 0.1 microM) of procaterol. This observation confirmed the absence of beta 2-adrenoceptors in these arteries. Responses of left circumflex artery to isoprenaline were potentiated by the extraneuronal uptake inhibitor drugs, corticosterone and metanephrine. 7 It is concluded (a) that responses of canine left circumflex artery, left ventricular branch and septal branch are mediated by a homogeneous population of beta 1-adrenoceptors, and (b) that modulation of responses to isoprenaline by extraneuronal uptake is not confined to responses mediated by beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "(+/-)-Isoprenaline (Iso), (-)-adrenaline (Ad), (-)-noradrenaline (NA), (+/-)-phenylephrine (Phe) and the beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist (+/-)-fenoterol (Fen) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of human isolated bronchial preparations. Iso, Ad and NA caused complete relaxation of both spontaneous and carbachol-induced bronchial tone. Fen, which was only tested in preparations where tone was induced with carbachol, also caused complete relaxation. However, Phe was a partial agonist in all preparations tested. When relaxation responses to these amines were calculated as a % of their maximal effects, comparison of EC50 values showed that the order of potency was Iso greater than Ad = Fen greater than NA greater than Phe (92:27:25:1:0.2) in preparations with carbachol-induced tone and Iso greater than Ad greater than NA greater than Phe (112:38:1:0.3) in preparations with spontaneous tone. pA2 values determined for the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (non-selective), atenolol (beta-selective) and ICI-118, 551 (beta 2-selective), using Iso as an agonist were, 9.3, 5.3 and 9.1 respectively. These results indicate that beta 2-adrenoceptors mediate relaxation of human isolated bronchus to sympathomimetic amines in preparations obtained 4-14 h post-mortem from non-diseased lung. alpha-Adrenoceptors were apparently sparse or absent in this tissue.", 
    "7": "beta-Adrenoceptors in the myometrium of the pregnant ewe were studied both functionally and by radioligand binding techniques using [3H] dihydroalprenolol (DHA). Spontaneous contractile activity in vitro was inhibited by beta-adrenoceptor agonists in a stereoselective manner; the order of potency suggested a beta 2-adrenoceptor was involved. The effects of salbutamol were antagonized competitively by propranolol but the antagonism demonstrated by atenolol and ICI 118,551 (beta 1- and beta 2-selective, respectively) was complex. DHA binding was saturable, rapidly reversible, stereoselective and appeared to occur to a single class of noninteracting sites with a Kd of 4.1 +/- 0.3 nM and a maximal capacity of 0.8 +/- 0.05 pmol/mg protein. Agonists demonstrated the same order of potency in competition for ligand binding sites as in inhibition of contractile activity. These data suggested that the DHA binding sites were part of the beta-adrenoceptor. Strong agonists occupied only 0.1% of all receptors to produce the full response. Competition experiments with antagonists produced complex curves which could be resolved into two components comprising approximately 70% and 30% of the total number of sites. It was suggested that these sites represented beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors, respectively. The possibility of regulation of the relative numbers of beta 2- and beta 1-adrenoceptors in the myometrium was discussed.", 
    "8": "Individual differences in cardiovascular regulation result from a dynamic interaction between genetically programmed developmental processes and extrinsic (environmental) conditions. The alterations in autonomic functioning previously identified among pups of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) strain suggest a genetic influence on autonomic development. In the present studies, an early stimulation procedure previously shown to reduce the behavioral and endocrine responsiveness of rodents in adulthood was demonstrated to alter both neural control of heart rate and regional brain catecholamine levels during the preweaning period. Pups from litters of SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were handled daily during the first postnatal week. Selective pharmacological blockade with atenolol and atropine methylnitrate was used to identify autonomic controls of heart rate at 16 and 28 days of age. Combined blockade was used to estimate intrinsic heart rate. In both SHR and WKY, early handling was associated with elevated basal heart rate, elevated intrinsic heart rate, and decreased sympathetic tone. Parasympathetic influence on heart rate was elevated by early handling in WKY and decreased by handling in SHR. In addition, an increase in dorsal cortical norepinephrine concentration was produced by early handling in both strains. These data suggest that early environmental conditions can interact with the genetic predisposition for elevated blood pressure and may play a potentially important role in organizing the neural controls of cardiovascular regulation.", 
    "9": "The present study describes developmental changes in autonomic controls of heart rate in a strain of rats genetically predisposed to hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive rats or SHR) and in a normotensive strain of rats (Wistar-Kyoto rats or WKY). Rat pups were tested at 4, 8, 12, and 16 days to determine heart rate changes after selective pharmacological treatments. Specifically, freely moving pups were treated with selective beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockers (i.e., atenolol and atropine methylnitrate), using procedures designed to produce minimal pain or discomfort. The results indicated that by 4 days of age there is a substantial sympathetic acceleratory influence on heart rate. Comparison of inferred autonomic control of the heart in prehypertensive SHR and normotensive WKY pups suggested exaggeration of this early sympathetic influence among SHR pups. After 2 wk of age, however, equivalent autonomic control of heart rate was seen in SHR and WKY rats, with the higher basal heart rate of SHR rats being mediated by an increased intrinsic heart rate (i.e., heart rate after combined blockade). These findings suggest that enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity may be an early expression of the genetic predisposition to develop hypertension.", 
    "10": "The effect of isometric exercise on hemodynamic parameters before and after beta blockade were investigated in two groups of six male volunteers, ages 25-28 years. On the basis of a randomized scheme, the subjects received either 15 mg propranolol i.v. or 0.5 mg mepindolol sulfate i.v. Cardiac output (CO) was determined by means of the Swan-Ganz thermodilution technique, and blood pressure was measured invasively in the radial artery. Analysis of the results pointed to the following conclusions. Isometric contraction brings about a reflex constriction of arterial and venous vessels, and thus an increase in blood pressure, pulmonary artery wedge pressures (PAWP) and CO, as well as a reduction in stroke volume (SV). The circulatory reflex mechanism operative during isometric exercise cannot be significantly influenced by beta blockade with propranolol or mepindolol sulfate. The increase in heart rate during isometric exercise is therefore unlikely to be the result of sympathetic activation, but rather of other (vagal?) reflex mechanisms.", 
    "11": "Increased circulating adrenaline produces systemic hypokalaemia by the stimulation of a membrane bound Na/K ATPase. In man, this enzyme appears to be linked to an adrenoceptor of the beta-subtype. We have further studied the subtype of beta-adrenoceptor involved by infusing adrenaline intravenously in normal volunteers after pretreatment with either a selective beta 2 antagonist (ICI 118551) or placebo. During the adrenaline infusion the serum potassium fell from 4.08 +/- 0.21 to 3.32 +/- 0.25 mmol/l (P less than 0.002). This adrenaline induced hypokalaemia was completely blocked by ICI 118551 (3.82 +/- 0.13 to 4.03 +/- 0.22 mmol/l, NS). Adrenaline also caused electrocardiographic changes of T wave flattening (-1.8 +/- 1.5 mm, P less than 0.05) whereas the T wave height increased after ICI 118551 (+ 1.0 +/- 0.9 mm, P less than 0.05). This suggests that adrenaline acts via beta 2 adrenoceptors in man to cause potassium influx and systemic hypokalaemia.", 
    "12": "We assessed the prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) in 111 migrainous patients and 111 controls matched for age and sex. While 29 (26%) of the 111 migrainous patients suffered from RP, its prevalence among the controls was seven (6%) of 111. Raynaud's phenomenon was diagnosed among 13 (33%) of 39 patients with classic migraine and 16 (22%) of 72 patients with common migraine. Drug treatment did not account for the different prevalence in the two groups. We conclude that RP occurs more frequently in patients suffering from migraine than in the non-migrainous population.", 
    "13": "The administration of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs in the pre-operative preparation and operative management of thyrotoxic patients undergoing subtotal thyroidectomy is reviewed. Particular reference is made to some of the recent advances and it is emphasised that there has been a considerable reduction in the incidence of problems following judicious use of these drugs. The choice of anaesthetic technique employed for thyroidectomy is less important than the degree of control of thyrotoxicosis by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug. Propranolol has proved safe and effective for the majority of patients. The longer acting agent nadolol is easier to administer, particularly in the peri-operative period. Patients are rendered less thyrotoxic and safety thereby enhanced by adding potassium iodide for 10 days preoperatively. The combination of nadolol and potassium iodide offers real advantages in the preparation of the thyrotoxic patient for surgery.", 
    "14": "A series of 4-substituted phenoxypropanolamines has been prepared and examined for beta-adrenoceptor activity. The 4-substituents, di- and triazole ring systems connected to the phenoxy ring by different length chains, were chosen as a means of introducing cardioselectivity. This has been achieved, especially in the 1-[4-[(4-chloropyrazol-1-yl)methoxy] phenoxy]-3-(isopropylamino)-2-propanol (11), the 4-[(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)methoxy] analogue (21), and the 4-[2-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)ethoxy] analogue (22), which show potent beta 1-blockade with selectivity ratios in excess of 100:1. Structure-activity relationships are discussed, and the optimum position of the heteroatom in the 4-substituent is defined.", 
    "15": "To clarify the role of noradrenergic neurons in the regulation of GH secretion, the effects of iv administered noradrenergic antagonists were investigated in freely moving, conscious male rabbits. During a 6-h observation period (1030-1630 h), control rabbits manifested pulsatile GH secretion with surges between 1030-1200 and 1415-1630 h. Phenoxybenzamine, (POB), an alpha-adrenergic blocker (5 mg/kg, twice), abolished the episodic GH surges; propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker (2.5 mg/kg, twice), did not. The bolus injection (1 or 10 micrograms) of synthetic human pancreatic GH-releasing factor (hpGHRF) with 44 amino acid residues (hpGHRF1-44) resulted in significant rises in the plasma GH of control animals. The plasma GH responses to hpGHRF1-44 were significantly larger in propranolol-treated than control rabbits. In contrast, POB completely suppressed the hpGHRF1-44-induced GH release. The injection of antisomatostatin (SRIF) serum into POB-treated rabbits did not yield a disinhibition of the episodic GH surges but restored the plasma GH rises after hpGHRF1-44 injection. These results indicate that noradrenaline++ plays an important role in regulating GH secretion in the rabbit. We propose that alpha-noradrenergic blockade suppresses GH release not only by inhibiting the release of hypothalamic GHRF but also by stimulating the secretion of SRIF and that beta-noradrenergic blockade enhances GH release by inhibiting the release of SRIF from the hypothalamus.", 
    "16": "The binding potencies of 3 new beta 2 blocking drugs to beta receptors in the ciliary processes were studied by means of radioligand techniques. The drugs studied were IPS339, ICI118,551, and Sandoz L1 32-468. The order of potency of these drugs was IPS339 greater than Sandoz L1 32-468 greater than ICI118,551. The beta 2 dissociation constants (KDs) for these drugs were 0.90 nM, 6.60 nM, and 55 nM respectively. These results are compared with those for other adrenergic agents, including timolol. The potential role of topical beta 2 blockers in glaucoma is discussed.", 
    "17": "Impairment of myocardial contractility results in reduction of cardiac output and activation of various compensatory mechanisms which eventually work to disadvantage. Drug treatment is directed towards improving myocardial contractility with inotropic agents and relieving congestion and vasoconstriction with diuretics and vasodilators. Digitalis is a relatively modest inotropic agent with considerable toxic potential and there is a need for alternative inotropic agents which are potent, active orally, effective long term and have minimal adverse effects. A number of beta agonists have been evaluated but their application appears limited to some extent by the development of tolerance, probably due to downregulation of myocardial beta receptors. Of the non-adrenergic inotropic agents currently under evaluation, amrinone appears most promising although its mechanism of action is not known.", 
    "18": "Tumor promoting phorbol esters can stimulate Ca++-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase. It has been suggested that this enzyme may mediate the effects of calcium-dependent hormones. In this paper the effects of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) on isolated rat hepatocyte metabolism were studied. Phorbol esters completely blocked alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation of glycogenolysis. This effect is quite specific for alpha 1-adrenergic actions, as the stimulations of glycogenolysis by vasopressin, angiotensin II, ionophore A-23187 and glucagon were unaffected by TPA. The potencies of the different phorbol esters used in this study suggests that the inhibitory effects of these agents may be due to activation of protein kinase C. The effect of phorbol esters on alpha 1-adrenergic actions seems to occur at an early step of the alpha 1-adrenergic action. TPA (10(-11) -10(-6)M) was unable to stimulate glycogenolysis. Urea synthesis, which is stimulated by vasopressin and alpha 1-adrenergic agents, was not stimulated by phorbol ester, neither alone nor in combination with the Ca++ ionophore A-23187.", 
    "19": "A quite heterogenous variety of drugs is used for the prophylactic treatment of patients with severe migraine. These drugs may prove effective in preventing migraine attacks due to two different pharmacological effects: a reduction of platelets' aggregability and/or an effect on blood vessels tone. The latter effect may be characterized by a decrease in reactivity, i.e. vasoconstriction as well as an overshooting vasodilation is prevented. The vascular tone is stabilized.", 
    "20": "The elderly have reduced beta-adrenergic sensitivity to agonists, but no change in receptor density. We investigated the relation between beta-receptor affinity for agonists and age in beta-receptors on lymphocytes from 20 healthy men 21 to 74 years old. As an index of beta-receptor affinity for agonists, we determined the IC50 of isoproterenol--the concentration of isoproterenol required to inhibit 50 per cent of iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding in vitro. We found that receptor affinity for agonists was correlated with age and plasma norepinephrine concentration. Twelve subjects (six 21 to 29 years old and six 55 to 74 years old) were also studied in both the supine and upright positions. In samples obtained in the supine position, the proportion of receptors binding agonist with a high affinity was decreased in the older subjects as compared with the young subjects (22 +/- 1 per cent vs. 38 +/- 3 per cent; P less than 0.05). With upright posture and the associated acute elevation of endogenous plasma catecholamines, the proportion of receptors binding agonist with a high affinity was reduced in the young; no such changes were seen in the older subjects. The data suggest that reduced beta-receptor affinity for agonists may be an explanation for altered beta-adrenergic sensitivity in the elderly.", 
    "21": "beta-Adrenergic receptors and the activities of adenylate cyclase, phosphodiesterase and protein kinase were examined in two human glioma cell lines, U 251 and LM, as well as in rat C6 glioma. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors was specific, saturable and of high affinity in each cell line. The dissociation constant (Kd) and maximal binding (Bmax) extrapolated from Scatchard curves were Kd = 17.4 +/- 3.2 nM and Bmax = 1110 +/- 197 fmol/mg protein for the U-251 cells; Kd = 14.4 +/- 2.2 nM and Bmax = 655 +/- 105 fmol/mg protein for the LM cells; and Kd = 5.6 +/- 1.1 nM and Bmax = 454 +/- 80 fmol/mg protein for the C6 glioma cells. L-Isoproterenol stimulated cyclic AMP formation in all 3 cell lines. beta-Adrenergic agonists also increased calcium-dependent and calcium non-dependent phosphodiesterase activity in these tumor cells. Cytosolic protein kinase in the 3 cell lines phosphorylated exogenous histone as a substrate. The phosphorylation was enhanced by cyclic AMP. Cytosolic protein kinase also phosphorylated endogenous cytosolic macromolecules. The phosphorylated proteins had molecular weights of 30,000, 51,000 and 90,000 in the two human glioma cell lines. The present results indicate that human glioma cell lines have functional beta-adrenergic receptors linked to adenylate cyclase. These beta-receptors can also regulate phosphodiesterase activity and cyclic AMP in human glioma cells can activate protein kinase and induce the phosphorylation of specific proteins.", 
    "22": "The effects of repeated mild stress on cortical alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites and on the rate of noradrenaline synthesis in cortical synaptosomes were measured. The stressful stimuli were either daily handling (1 min) or daily handling which included an i.p. saline injection. In both cases, rats killed 24 h after the last of 14 daily treatments showed an increase in noradrenaline synthesis rate and a decrease of alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor density. There were no changes in adrenoceptor density or the noradrenaline synthesis rate after either a single or 5 daily handlings plus saline injections. At no time was a change found in the Kd of either alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptor binding sites. The results are discussed in relation to the effects on adrenoceptors of chronic antidepressant treatments.", 
    "23": "A 7-day treatment with 20 mg/kg/day desipramine reduced the immobility time in the behavioral \"despair\" test in rats. The effect of DMI was antagonized by sulpiride (100 mg/kg i.p.), metoclopramide (20 mg/kg i.p.) and clopazine (20 mg/kg i.p.) but not by haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) or chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg i.p.). Alpha-adrenoreceptor blockers (prazosin 3 mg/kg s.c.; aceperone 10 mg/kg i.p.; azapetine 24 mg/kg s.c.; phentolamine 20 mg/kg i.p.), dl-propranolol (5 mg/kg i.p.) and clonidine (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) failed to modify the anti-immobility effect of DMI. The data suggest that a particular subtype of dopamine receptors is involved in the anti-immobility effect of a 7-day treatment with DMI in the behavioral \"despair\" test in rats.", 
    "24": "Treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension is often unsatisfactory. A patient with the Shy-Drager syndrome, in which the most important symptom is orthostatic hypotension, was treated with prenalterol, initially 30 mg six times daily. The dosage was reduced to 30 mg four times daily because of the development of complex ventricular premature beats. Orthostatic symptoms were reduced and standing blood pressure increased. Fludrocortisone 0.5 mg a day was added to treatment with further improvement. This clinical effect was maintained throughout 12 months of follow up, during which the treatment was continued unchanged. Prenalterol was effective in reducing orthostatic symptoms in this patient. Further studies in patients with a similar haemodynamic pattern are indicated.", 
    "25": "Reported are pharmacologic data from a new animal model used for evaluating drugs from several therapeutic classes for their potential use in the treatment of premature labor. This model measures the spontaneous delivery time between the first and second rat pups in a term pregnancy. In control animals, this averaged 16.3 +/- 4.2 minutes. Ethanol (3.5 gm/kg) and the beta-agonists ritodrine (12.5 mg/kg) and albuterol (0.25 mg/kg) significantly delayed delivery of the second pup. The calcium blockers nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem were the most active of all compounds tested in this model. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents indomethacin and naproxen were inactive at doses as high as 5 and 25 mg/kg, respectively. Metiamide, an H2-antagonist, and dimenhydrinate, an H1-antagonist, were inactive.", 
    "26": "There is growing evidence that two, or possibly more, neurotransmitters can coexist within the same neurone. In particular, the presence of a peptide and a biogenic amine has been demonstrated in the same terminals of central and peripheral neurones. These findings have led to the hypothesis that neurotransmitters, coexisting within the same neurones, can interact at pre- or postsynaptic sites in a functionally coordinated manner. However, interactions between neurotransmitters contained in distinct neuronal systems terminating within the same region of the central nervous system (CNS) can be envisaged. We have examined this last possibility in the cerebral cortex, an area of the CNS where the two neurotransmitters vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and noradrenaline are contained in separate neuronal systems and where they both stimulate the formation of cyclic AMP. We report here that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and noradrenaline act synergistically to stimulate the formation of cyclic AMP and that this synergistic interaction is antagonized by the specific alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine.", 
    "27": "Neurotransmitters and hormones mediate their effects through interaction with specific receptors. A complete understanding of the effects of these chemical signals requires detailed knowledge, at the molecular level, of agonist/receptor interactions. It is likely that agonists and antagonists interact with the same site on a receptor. Agonists, however, are by definition different from antagonists in that agonists are responsible for transducing information across the cell membrane, ultimately resulting in a biological response, while antagonists appear to act through passive occupancy of receptors. Implicit in this concept is the idea that these fundamental differences between agonists and antagonists arise from the sequelae induced by agonist-specific interactions with receptors.", 
    "28": "Slices of rat hypothalamus were superfused and endogenous release of dopamine (DA) was measured by high performance liquid chromatography combined with electrochemical detection. The K+ (20 mM)-evoked release in the presence of tetrodotoxin was Ca2+-dependent. The evoked release was facilitated by a beta-agonist, isoproterenol and this effect was completely abolished by a beta-antagonist, 1-propranolol. Isoproterenol also concentration-dependently facilitated the electrically (at 5Hz) evoked release of DA. The pretreatment with 1-propranolol, beta 1-antagonist, atenolol and beta 2-antagonist, butoxamine shifted the concentration-effect curve of isoproterenol to the right. On the other hand, beta 1-agonist, tazolol, beta 2-agonist, salbutamol and low concentration (10(-9) M) of adrenaline also facilitated the release. 1-Propranolol alone reduced the electrically (at 2 Hz) evoked release, and this effect was completely abolished when the adrenaline content in the brain was drastically reduced by use of a potent PNMT inhibitor, DCMB. These findings suggest that in the rat hypothalamus adrenaline released from adrenaline-containing nerve terminals probably modulates DA release via presynaptic beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors on DA nerve terminals.", 
    "29": "Fifty-two patients, most of whom had had daily headaches for years, were examined and treated. Among them there were 40 who originally had migraine, the others had vasomotor or post-contusional headaches. Average duration of the migraine was 21 years, of chronic headache 7.6 years. All patients had been taking analgesics of a mixed type regularly and for a long time, on average 35.6 tablets or suppositories weekly. All patients had taken more than three different drugs. After an observation period of 3-6 months for grading the headaches and registering the amount of drug intake, all patients were admitted to hospital when all analgesics were at once discontinued. Changing degrees of withdrawal symptoms were the rule: increased headaches, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, sweating, sleep disorders, and in some also hallucinations and cerebral episodes. At the end of the hospital stay chronic headache had completely disappeared or markedly improved in 77% of patients. Even after an average of 16 months of subsequent observation, chronic headache continued to be significantly improved in 70% of patients. There was a significant reduction in frequency and intensity of attacks in the patients with originally typical migraine. Regular intake of analgesics of the mixed type induces chronic headaches. These are most commonly caused by ergotamine tartrate and aminophenol derivatives, while psychological and physical dependence on anti-migraine drugs is initiated and maintained by additional barbiturates, caffeine and codeine.", 
    "30": "Combinations of a beta-blocker and a diuretic often produce a greater fall in blood pressure than does either drug alone. Furthermore, beta-blockers prevent an increase in plasma renin activity, thereby attenuating diuretic-induced potassium excretion and also the reduction in hypotensive response to the diuretic. This study was designed to compare the effects of the two fixed-dose combinations atenolol 100 mg plus chlorthalidone 25 mg (Tenoretic; ICI) and sotalol 320 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg (Sotazide; B-M) on the pattern of diuresis and the biochemical composition of the urine in normal subjects. These preparations differ mainly in that the plasma half-lives of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide are 60 hours and 6 hours respectively; the former therefore accumulates when given once daily while the latter does not. These two preparations were found to have similar effects on the pattern of diuresis and the biochemical values. It is therefore concluded that the relationship between the serum chlorthalidone level and the fall in serum potassium level is in keeping with the flat dose-response curves for the thiazide and phthalimide diuretics.", 
    "31": "An investigation was made into the effect of various types of beta blockers, an alpha blocker, a combined alpha and beta blocker, and a diuretic on physical performance in a normotensive man. Beta blockers, the alpha blocker, and the combined alpha and beta blocker significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced physical performance. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in a larger series of subjects.", 
    "32": "Pyrethroid insecticides have been reported to increase transmembrane sodium influx and inhibit ion-dependent ATPases in insect, squid, and toad nerve tissues. Since changes in sarcolemmal ion fluxes and inhibition of membrane-bound ATPases can alter myocardial contractility, the effects of a potent synthetic pyrethroid, decamethrin, on mammalian myocardium were examined using isolated left atrial muscle of the guinea-pig heart electrically stimulated at 1.5 Hz. Decamethrin (0.1-10 microM) increased the force of isometric contraction in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the resting tension. Propranolol (5 microM) reduced the magnitude of the pyrethroid's inotropic effect; however, a significant inotropic effect was still observed with 1 and 10 microM decamethrin in the presence of this concentration of propranolol. Similar results were noted in the presence of 500 microM procainamide and in left atrial muscle obtained from reserpine-treated animals. The results suggest that decamethrin increased the force of myocardial contraction by two mechanisms; indirectly by releasing catecholamines from sympathetic nerve terminals and directly by an action on the myocardium. Inotropic concentrations of the pyrethroid did not inhibit partially purified rat brain or guinea pig heart Na+, K+-ATPase. Moreover, twitch tension recordings of isometric contractions showed that, in the presence of propranolol, decamethrin increased tension development without changing either the time to peak tension or the duration of contraction. Tetrodotoxin almost completely abolished the positive inotropic effect of decamethrin. Thus, the positive inotropic effect of decamethrin is apparently due to an increase in transmembrane sodium influx which causes catecholamine release from the sympathetic nerve terminals and also directly enhances muscle contraction.", 
    "33": "The anti-arrhythmic effectiveness of an oral treatment schedule combining three times 200 mg mexiletine and three times 20 mg propranolol daily was compared with each drug given alone in 14 patients with stable or reproducible ventricular extrasystoles of various aetiologies, randomly divided into two groups for different therapy sequences. After each treatment phase the results and any changes in cardiac status were compared by analysing resting, exercise and long-term ECG records. Definite success of treatment with the combined drugs was obtained in nine patients with ventricular premature systoles (VPS) and in all patients with coupled VPS. A favourable influence on bigeminal and exercise-induced arrhythmias was also demonstrated. There was a significant difference in the frequency of ectopic beats between treatment with mexiletine alone or in combination with propranolol as regards the frequency of ventricular and exercise-induced premature systoles.", 
    "34": "The ability of the beta 1 partial agonists prenalterol and corwin , to displace the binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol to the heterogeneous populations of beta-adrenoceptors on rat and rabbit lung membranes was compared. Both drugs exhibited higher affinity for the binding sites in rabbit lung (predominant beta 1) as compared to rat lung (predominant beta 2). Curve fitting analysis of the displacement curves into high affinity (beta 1) and low affinity (beta 2) components indicates that both drugs exhibit beta 1 selective affinity. Further competition experiments performed in the presence of carefully calculated concentrations of highly selective beta 1 (atenolol) or beta 2 (ICI 118,551) antagonists to produce homogeneous receptor subtype populations in rat and rabbit lung membranes respectively, confirmed this beta 1 selective affinity. These results suggest an approximate selective affinity ratio (beta 1 to beta 2) of ten and forty fold for prenalterol and corwin respectively.", 
    "35": "We have investigated the effects of catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine and isoproterenol) and tyramine on sinoatrial conduction time (SACT), sinus cycle length (SCL) and developed tension (DT) in isolated atrial muscle, using an isolated and blood-perfused dog atrial preparation, perfused with heparinized blood from the carotid artery of the anesthetized donor dog. Each substance was continuously administered intraarterially into the cannulated sinus node artery. They had dose-dependent positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Each produced not only a shortening but a prolongation of SACT. In experiments in which only a shortening occurred, the order of the potency for inducing the shortening of the SACT was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine = epinephrine greater than dopamine greater than tyramine. The ratio of doses required to produce roughly a 15-25% shortening of the SACT was 1: 10: 10: 100: 300, respectively. The isoproterenol-induced shortening of the SACT was inhibited by treatment with propranolol. Tyramine-induced shortening was inhibited by imipramine. From these results, it is suggested that sympathomimetic amines induce a shortening of SACT through adrenergic beta-receptors and also readily induce a pacemaker shift in the SA nodal area.", 
    "36": "The effector mechanisms responsible for the bradycardia evoked by bilateral lesions of the brainstem coinciding with the A1 catecholamine cells were analyzed in four groups of rabbits. Sham or lesion operations were carried out in animals with intact cardiac effectors, with cardiac sympathetic block induced by propranolol, with cardiac vagal block induced by methylscopolamine and with total cardiac autonomic block induced by the use of both drugs together. Lesions produced a transient increase in blood pressure of 25 (s.e.m. = 4) mmHg and a transient bradycardia, or increase in heart period of 141 (s.e.m. = 18) ms. The bradycardia had both baroreflex-independent and baroreflex-dependent components as determined from analysis of stimulus response curves relating heart period to mean arterial pressure. The 'baroindependent' component of the bradycardia, measured as a lengthening in heart period, ranged from 35-49 ms in the four groups of animals and was unaffected by administration of propranolol alone, methylscopolamine alone, or of both together. These findings suggest that the baroindependent slowing of the heart is not mediated through changes in activity of either the cardiac sympathetic nerves or of the vagal fibres innervating the heart. The 'baroreceptor' component of the bradycardia reflects that portion of the decrease in heart rate resulting directly from the increase in blood pressure. This component was found to account for a lengthening in the heart period of 81 (s.e.m. = 23) ms in animals with intact effector mechanisms: it was virtually abolished by methylscopolamine (0 ms, s.e.m. = 13) but not significantly affected by propranolol (54 ms, s.e.m. = 25), indicating that this barodependent component is predominantly mediated through the vagus.", 
    "37": "The reactivity to NA was studied in vas deferens and atrial preparations from adult rats undernourished at perinatal age. The contractile response on isolated vas deferens was markedly reduced in experimental preparations as compared with controls; however, the maximal contractile response elicited by Ba++ did not differ between them. Furthermore, the positive chronotropic effect of NA on isolated atria was significantly lower in preparations from deprived animals. The specific beta adrenergic receptor binding was significantly reduced in the hearts of experimental animals as compared with controls, without changes in receptor affinity. These results demonstrated that, in addition to changes in reactivity on vascular bed previously described, perinatal undernutrition produces a subsensitivity to adrenergic agonist on other peripheral sympathetic innervated tissues, as vas deferens and heart. This subsensitivity may be the consequence of a reduction in the number of adrenergic receptors caused by early malnutrition.", 
    "38": "Little is known about the action adrenaline has on vascular areas of functionally different parts of the stomach and intestine. Therefore the vasoactivity of adrenaline (1-1024 ng/kg i.v.) was studied by electromagnetic flow measurements in 8 vascular beds covering the gastrointestinal tract. Adrenaline induced 1) a vasodilation in the lesser curvature and antrum of the stomach; 2) a vasoconstriction in the greater curvature of the stomach; 3) a vasoconstriction followed by a vasodilation in the duodenum and jejunum; 4) a vasoconstriction in the ileum, caecum/colon and colon/rectum. Phenoxybenzamine (750 micrograms/kg i.v.) blocked systematically the vasoconstriction in the duodenum and jejunum but not in the ileum and colon. Vasodilation could be blocked by propranolol (100 micrograms/kg i.v.). It is concluded that 1) adrenaline-effects are mediated predominantly by beta-receptors in the antrum and lesser curvature of the stomach; predominantly by alpha-receptors in the greater curvature of the stomach; by alpha- and beta-receptors in the duodenum and jejunum; 2) receptors in the large intestine are of another alpha-adrenergic type than those in the small intestines. Evidence was provided for a gradient of diminishing vasodilating effects of adrenaline from cranial to caudal of the gut.", 
    "39": "Propranolol and Dyazide (25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene) were used singly to reduce the elevated blood pressure (systolic ranging from 170 to 271 mmHg and diastolic ranging from 100 to 141 mmHg) of 38 elderly hypertensive patients whose ages ranged from 69 to 91 years. Each compound was administered for a period of four weeks with a wash-out period of four weeks in between. The following parameters were assessed before and after each treatment period: cerebral blood flow (CBF), mental functions, cardiac output (CO), electrocardiogram, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and serum biochemistry. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced following the administration of either compound. No significant change in CBF and CO could be observed after reducing the blood pressure whether Propranolol or Dyazide was used. The GFR was, however, significantly reduced and the plasma creatinine significantly increased following Dyazide but not Propranolol administration. As expected the administration of the latter compound was associated with a significant bradycardia. No significant change could be observed in the other parameters studied.", 
    "40": "30 hypertensive patients aged over 60 years underwent an antihypertensive treatment for a time of 3 months with Viskaldix . There was an excellent hypotensive effect in supine and standing position and no bradycardia or orthostatic dysregulation occurred. Metabolic parameters were not influenced, and this is of great importance in elderly patients. It seems notable that elderly patients may benefit from a beta-blocker therapy, as there is clinical or subclinical coronary heart disease.", 
    "41": "The hypothesis that homeostatic control mechanisms control mucociliary function in ciliated mucous membranes was induced artificially by means of mechanical stimulation. The edge of right palatine cleft was stimulated mechanically by gentle touching with a dissecting needle, and sinus clearance time was recorded as soon as mechanical stimulation was initiated. Mechanical stimulation caused acceleration of mucociliary flow of the sinus; sinus clearance time was accelerated on the side adjacent to the mechanically stimulated side of the palatine cleft, but not on the opposite side. Therefore, the reflex may be effective only on the stimulated side. We investigated the effect of nerve blockers on mechanical stimulation. Mucociliary clearance in the chicken sinus was not affected by parasympatholytic agents, but was decelerated by the beta-adrenergic blocker. The effect of nerve blockers on the mechanical stimulation showed that parasympatholytic agents blocked mechanical stimulation, while sympatholytic agents did not completely block the response. These data suggest that mucociliary clearance may be regulated by the reflex of parasympathetic and partially sympathetic nerve fibers.", 
    "42": "The effects of iontophoretic applications of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) on potentials evoked by the stimulation of the hippocampal slice preparations were investigated. Dopamine, ejected at the soma, produced an increase of the amplitude of the population spike of CA1 pyramidal cells; NA had an excitatory action on some responses, inhibitory on others. The field-excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were unaffected by ejection of DA and NA on the dendritic tree. Domperidone, a dopaminergic antagonist, blocked the increase of the population spike induced by DA, but was unable to antagonize noradrenergic responses. Timolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, blocked the excitatory action of NA, but did not modify either the effect of DA or the inhibition induced by NA. Phentolamine, an alpha-antagonist, antagonized only the inhibition induced by NA. These results indicate that DA and NA modulate the activity of hippocampal neurones by interacting on different receptors.", 
    "43": "The influence of pre-ischemic treatment with propranolol (0.8 mg/kg bw) or with verapamil (0.1 mg/kg bw) on myocardial O2 consumption and on coronary resistance after cardioplegic arrest (300 minutes at 22 degrees - 24 degrees C) was investigated, using a Langendorff technique in open chest experiments (canine hearts). For myocardial protection histidine buffered Bretschneider solution was used, while for standardization all hearts were postischemically reperfused with a modified Tyrode solution at 35 degrees C. Both drugs were given intravenously in two fractions, 60 and 30 minutes before the onset of cardioplegic perfusion; a third group was not pretreated. Although the verapamil group had the lowest O2 consumption post-ischemically, the most impressive results were found in coronary resistance. Propranolol significantly diminished coronary resistance (p less than 0.05), while verapamil distinctly enhanced it compared to the non treated group. The \"membrane labilizing\" effect of verapamil combined with calcium-free cardioplegic solution was confirmed by a massive postischemic myocardial sodium uptake.", 
    "44": "Studies were conducted on the direct actions of counterirritants on the peripheral circulation and the reflex actions on muscular circulation that would refer to the skin nerve excitation activated with counterirritants . Blood pressure falling tendencies were observed with menthol, thymol, and methyl salicylate (MS) without any effects on respiration, heart rates, and blood flow in femoral artery and gastrochemius muscle. Vasodilatation was caused by the direct application of menthol, camphor, and MS in the isolated ear vessels of rabbits, but none of the counterirritants had effects when they were externally applied on the skin of the ear in plaster form. An increase (circa 40%) in gastrocnemius muscle blood flow was induced by the external application of plasters which contained menthol, camphor, or nonylic vanilyl amide ( NVA ) on the skin of rabbit's hind limb. A slight augmentation was also observed after the application of plasters with MS and without drugs, but these effects disappeared after the hemisection electrical stimulation on the sural nerve of rabbits disappeared almost completely after the pretreatment with propranolol (40 micrograms/kg, i.v.), but atropine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) had no effect. A rise of blood flow in the deep radial muscle elicited by electrical stimulation on the superficial radial nerve remained after the spinal transection at the C 3 level, and at this time, the A beta and A delta components were involved in the superficial radial nerve. These results suggest that when plasters containing counterirritants were externally applied on the skin, direct actions of percutaneously absorbed drugs on peripheral circulation are not expected, but a rise of muscle blood flow is thought to be induced by the spinal somato sympathetic reflex that will cause a suppression on tonic activity in the sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve or a stimulation on beta-adrenoceptors referred to adrenaline released from the adrenal gland.", 
    "45": "In cat papillary muscles, under control conditions (1.25 mmol/L Ca2+ bathing solution, 25 degrees C), increasing the afterload by switching from isotonic to isometric contraction elicited a positive inotropic response. Halving the bath [Ca2+] resulted in a percentagewise similar or greater positive inotropic response to increased afterload, while doubling the bath [Ca2+] reduced and caffeine abolished or reversed this response, indicating [Ca2+]i predictably influences it. Since it was markedly reduced by verapamil and unaffected by propranolol, the positive inotropic response to increased afterload was concluded to be largely due to increased Ca2+ influx, unrelated to catecholamine release, caused by increased mean muscle length over time owing to the changing from isotonic to isometric contraction. While at 25 degrees C, increasing the afterload caused a positive inotropic response at 12 to 48 stimulations/min, at 37 degrees C and at similar frequencies, a negative inotropic response occurred. This reversed to a positive inotropic response at 86 stimulations/min, well below the normal cat heart rate, suggesting an increased afterload would cause a positive inotropic response via this mechanism in vivo, as observed for years in intact mammalian hearts. Similarities between positive inotropic responses to increased afterload in isolated cardiac muscle, isolated hearts, and intact animals indicate all may be examples of the same phenomenon (Anrep effect).",

    "47": "Clinical and hemodynamic investigations of the effects of the new beta-receptor blocking agent mepindolol were compared with those of pindolol in studies with seven male subjects 23-34 years old. Mepindolol was found to be more effective in lowering the resting and exercise heart rate at lower dose levels. A more pronounced increase in right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure was observed on exercise, but there was no difference between the two drugs in the effect on cardiac output. Thus mepindolol seems to have a greater effect on chronotropic than on inotropic receptors. This means that the drug can be given to patients with exertional angina without increasing the risk of cardiac decompensation.", 
    "48": "We have measured the psychological effects of acebutolol and atenolol in sixteen patients with essential hypertension. The drugs were administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind manner, in single daily doses of 100 mg atenolol, 400 mg acebutolol or placebo for periods of 6 weeks, each drug period being separated by a placebo period. At each 2 weekly clinic visit, a questionnaire designed for assessment of state anxiety and state arousal was administered for self-completion. Arousal was significantly reduced by atenolol over the whole 6 weeks of administration. It was not affected by acebutolol. Anxiety was significantly reduced by acebutolol but only at the first of the three 2 weekly assessments on treatment. It was not affected by atenolol. Differences in the psychological effects of these two beta-adrenoceptor blockers are discussed in terms of their lipid solubility and haemodynamic effects.", 
    "49": "We have studied the physiological responses to 50 min of intermittent, moderate exercise in hypertensive men after the ingestion of a single dose of placebo, propranolol or metoprolol, and also after 28 days treatment. In addition, subjective assessments of mood were made during the last 7 days of each period of chronic treatment. Heart rate and blood pressure, both at rest and during exercise, were significantly reduced by a single dose of propranolol or metoprolol; more marked effects were observed after chronic treatment. Ventilation and gas exchange during exercise were only slightly disturbed by single doses of propranolol or metoprolol, whereas chronic treatment had no effect. Perceived exertion scores were increased after a single dose of either drug, compared to placebo, and the effect of propranolol was greater than that of metoprolol. With chronic treatment there were fewer differences between the perceived exertion scores during exercise, although 'leg' fatigue remained greater after propranolol than after placebo. Sweating from the forehead during exercise was enhanced by a single dose of either beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, with propranolol having the greater effect. After chronic treatment the effect of propranolol was diminished, whereas the effect of metoprolol was maintained. Very few disturbances of mood were found after chronic ingestion of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "50": "Propranolol induced changes in blood plasma chemistry were followed in thirty hypertensive patients (WHO I-II) who were seen each week during 14-15 weeks. The initial 4 weeks were a drug free period and the next 2 weeks were a drug adjustment period. After that the patients were on an unchanged propranolol dose for 8 weeks (40, 80 or 160 mg four times daily). For all observed changes the correlation was studied to (1) dose, (2) free and total simultaneously determined plasma concentration and (3) free and total average plasma concentration of unchanged drug during the preceding 24 h period. Total protein and albumin did not change significantly. After 4 and 8 weeks on the final dose orosomucoid was increased significantly (by 10%) compared with the value from the end of the drug free period. Creatinine rose significantly during the initial 4-6 weeks therapy to remain at the same level during the last 4 weeks. Urate was increased at the two lowest dose levels. Total cholesterol fell significantly (5%) while triglycerides increased significantly (16%). T4 rose significantly, T3 fell and r-T3 rose significantly in a dose dependent way. Interindividually r-T3 was the only biochemical change showing a significant relationship to the propranolol plasma concentration. The relationship reached the highest level of significance to the average 24 h free concentration.", 
    "51": "Felodipine, a dihydropyridine, is a new vasodilating calcium antagonist which lowers blood pressure (BP) by selective action on vascular smooth muscle, especially in the resistance vessels. The effects on BP, heart rate (HR) and tolerance of different single oral doses of felodipine were studied in two series of hypertensive patients. When felodipine was given as single drug to 14 previously untreated hypertensives in a single-blind manner, BP was rapidly reduced by about 15% while HR increased by 25%. Felodipine given in a double-blind manner to eight patients on chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade reduced BP by some 15-20% compared to placebo, while HR did not change. There was a significant correlation between the pre-treatment mean arterial BP (MAP) and the maximal relative change in MAP, i.e. the higher the initial BP the greater the reduction after felodipine. A significant correlation was also found between the plasma concentration of felodipine and the relative change in MAP. Felodipine was generally well tolerated. When given alone felodipine caused the side effects expected from a pure vasodilator, i.e. headache, flushing and palpitations. When given together with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, the side effects were much less apparent.", 
    "52": "Effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were measured in 22 mild-to-moderate, uncomplicated, essential hypertensive patients during placebo and after 3 months of randomly assigned treatment either with prizidilol (n = 10) or propranolol (n = 12). Measurements were performed at rest and during cycloergometer exercise. For a comparable effect on blood pressure effective renal plasma flow was significantly increased at rest by prizidilol (+9%) and decreased by propranolol (-13.6%); these patterns were maintained during exercise. Glomerular filtration rate was immodified after the treatment with both drugs. It is concluded that prizidilol is an effective hypotensive agent with no deleterious effects on renal haemodynamics.", 
    "53": "According to hemodynamic theories of atherogenesis, atherosclerotic plaques are a reaction to endothelial damage caused by arterial flow disturbances such as turbulence. Earlier studies showed that hydralazine increased, whereas propranolol decreased, the product of heart rate X blood velocity, a predictor of arterial flow disturbances, and that hydralazine aggravated, whereas propranolol decreased turbulence in the region of carotid artery stenosis. This study was done to test the hypothesis that drugs which reduce arterial flow disturbances may be more effective in preventing atherosclerosis, than antihypertensive drugs which worsen arterial flow disturbances. Eighty-three New Zealand white rabbits were made hypertensive by a one-kidney Goldblatt procedure, and were fed a 1% cholesterol diet. Untreated hypertensive (P less than 0.01) and hydralazine-treated hypertensive rabbits (P less than 0.05) had significantly more atherosclerosis than did the normotensive controls; propranolol-treated rabbits did not differ significantly from the normotensive controls. Analysis of covariance showed that propranolol-treated rabbits had significantly less atherosclerosis than hydralazine-treated rabbits with blood pressure (P less than 0.04) or heart rate (P less than 0.006) as the covariates.", 
    "54": "After oral administration, the fraction of unchanged drug available systemically is predominantly governed by hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme activity and/or binding to the liver. If the \"well stirred\" model for hepatic elimination mimics reality, the apparent oral clearance (Clo) of metoprolol, a drug which is completely absorbed and metabolized only by the liver, should reflect the intrinsic clearance (Cli), i.e., the maximum enzyme activity in absence of blood flow limitations. According to theory, the hepatic venous (hv) drug concentrations after an i.v. dose are also a function of Cli. This postulate has previously been verified in the isolated perfused rat liver by others and has now been tested by us in the intact rhesus monkey. We have compared Clo, Cli and the systemic clearance (Cls) of metoprolol in six rhesus monkeys catheterized in the hepatic and femoral veins (hv; fv). They were given simultaneously 37 to 73 micrograms of [3H]metoprolol i.v. and 9 mg of metoprolol per kg b.w. orally. Unlabeled drug was analyzed in plasma by gas chromatography and 3H-labeled metoprolol by liquid scintillation after liquid chromatography separation. The Cls [dose i.v./area under the blood concentration vs. time curve in the femoral vein (AUCs)] varied between 27 and 32 ml X kg-1 X min-1. As expected, the Clo (doseo/AUCs) was considerably higher and ranged from 89 to 147 ml X kg-1 X min-1. The Cli (dosei.v./AUChv) was in the same range as Clo (46-163 ml X kg-1 X min-1). The determined oral availability was 19 to 31% with a mean of 25.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "55": "Tetanus toxin, fragment B and fragment C were assayed for toxicity on the mouse phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparation. The native toxin was a potent blocker of neuromuscular transmission; fragment B possessed little toxicity and fragment C was atoxic. Pretreatment of tissues with fragment C antagonized the neuromuscular blocking properties of tetanus toxin, but not those of type A botulinum toxin or beta-bungarotoxin. Agents that antagonize cholera toxin (B subunit) and diphtheria toxin (CRM197) did not antagonize tetanus toxin and did not alter the ability of fragment C to antagonize tetanus toxin. Fragment C exerted its effect by competing with unbound toxin for receptor sites on the nerve membrane. The fragment did not: 1) displace bound toxin; 2) inhibit internalization of toxin; or 3) inhibit intracellular expression of toxicity. In assays on intact cells, under conditions in which toxin binding was not dissociable, fragment C binding to phrenic nerves had an apparent KD of approximately 1.4 X 10(-7) M. Homogenates of mouse cerebral cortex adsorbed tetanus toxin and these homogenates competed with phrenic nerves for unbound toxin. Homogenized cortex did not displace or promote desorption of toxin already bound to phrenic nerves. Homogenates of eel and torpedo electric organ were not very effective in adsorbing toxin.", 
    "56": "The comparative haemodynamic dose-response effects of beta- (propranolol) or alpha- plus beta-blockade (labetalol) were evaluated in a randomised between-group study of 16 patients with an uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. In equivalent beta-blocking doses both drugs equally reduced myocardial stroke work index and presumably myocardial oxygen requirements. However, although propranolol reduced heart rate and cardiac output, these haemodynamic changes were accompanied by an augmentation of systemic vascular resistance. In contrast, labetalol reduced heart rate, cardiac output without change in systemic vascular resistance. Moreover, concomitant alpha- and beta-blockade with labetalol resulted in lesser depression of cardiac output at equivalent beta-blocking doses to propranolol. These results suggest that the addition of alpha to beta-blockade may attenuate some of the adverse reflex circulatory consequences of pure beta-blockade; the usefulness of this pharmacological approach to the manipulation of the circulation in the early post-infarction period merits further study.", 
    "57": "Immobilization stress applied for 6 h induced, in adult male rats, a rise of epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) plasma levels and a decrease of baseline plasma testosterone (T) values and of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-induced T response. Treatment of the animals for 5 weeks with guanethidine (G), a sympathetic neuron toxic agent, significantly decreased E and NE responses to stress and partly antagonized the inhibitory effects exerted by immobilization on T biosynthesis. Adrenalectomy totally suppressed circulating E and reduced the stress-induced NE increase while partly antagonizing the inhibitory effects exerted on T biosynthesis. Combined G and adrenalectomy treatments totally suppressed plasma E and NE, and completely blocked the effects of immobilization on T levels. Treatment of the animals with the alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, prazosin, and the beta 1-adrenergic blocker, metoprolol, did not modify the effects of stress on T biosynthesis. Treatment with propranolol or with butoxamine, a nonspecific beta- and a specific beta 2-adrenergic receptor blocker, respectively, antagonized the testicular hyposensitivity to hCG induced by stress. Stress- or treatment-induced changes of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and hCG levels were not consistently correlated with plasma T modifications. These findings suggest that at least part of the inhibitory effects of immobilization stress on T biosynthesis is exerted by catecholamines through a beta 2-adrenergic receptor.",

    "59": "A patient presenting with hyperthyroidism had a rapidly enlarging thyroid mass that histopathologically was a diffuse histiocytic lymphoma arising in a gland with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The concurrent development of both hyperthyroidism and lymphoma may have resulted from similar immunologic abnormalities. Appreciation of the relationship between thyroid lymphoma and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and their presentation with either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism should lead to an earlier diagnosis of lymphoma and improved survival.", 
    "60": "Treatment of hypertension with beta-adrenergic blockers may impair renal perfusion, perhaps because of beta 2-blockade in the renal vascular bed. We evaluated the effects of the cardioselective (beta 1 selective) beta-blocker metoprolol upon renal hemodynamics, intravascular volume, and renal electrolyte handling in nine essential hypertensive men. Metoprolol normalized systemic BP without significant acute or chronic changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, or renal blood flow. Overall renal sodium excretion and fractional sodium excretion increased on chronic metoprolol, without changes in intravascular volume or renal excretion of other electrolytes. Thus, cardioselective beta-blockade with metoprolol normalizes BP without renal hemodynamic impairment.", 
    "61": "The electrophysiologic effects of intravenous verapamil and propranolol were compared alone and in combination in 14 patients (aged 21 to 69 years) with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Ten patients had atrioventricular (AV) reentry utilizing a manifest (7 patients) or concealed (3 patients) accessory pathway. Four patients had AV nodal reentry. Electrophysiology studies were performed using standard techniques in the control state and after verapamil (0.15 mg/kg intravenous bolus and 0.005 mg/kg/min). The next day, studies were repeated after propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) and a combination of verapamil and propranolol. No adverse effects occurred with the drug combination. Each drug intervention prolonged anterograde functional refractory period of the AV node (control, 370 +/- 50 ms; verapamil, 446 +/- 90 ms; propranolol, 436 +/- 92, p less than 0.05), with the greatest increase occurring after the drug combination (502 +/- 103 ms, p less than 0.001). In 2 patients prolonged sinus node recovery time developed after the drug combination. Verapamil or propranolol prevented SVT induction in 7 patients (50%). However, only the drug combination prevented reinduction of sustained SVT in 6 patients. These 6 patients were treated chronically with verapamil and propranolol, with no recurrence of SVT in any patient after 2 to 26 months.", 
    "62": "Fourteen patients with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) underwent serial treadmill testing, and those with reproducible arrhythmia were treated with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. In 11 patients (79%), VT of similar rate, morphologic characteristics and duration was reproduced on 2 consecutive treadmill tests performed 1 to 14 days apart. Beta blockade prevented recurrent VT during acute testing in 10 of 11 patients and during chronic therapy in 9. Eight patients had a consistent relation between a critical sinus rate and the onset of VT. In these patients, successful therapy correlated with preventing achievement of the critical sinus rate during maximal exercise. Thus, serial exercise testing is an appropriate means of assessing efficacy of therapy in patients with exercise-induced VT, provided that reproducibility is established on 2 control tests before beginning treatment. Therapy with beta-blocking agents is effective, especially when guided by the presence of a critical sinus rate-VT relation."
