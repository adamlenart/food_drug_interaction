The purpose of this study is to determine whether ocular and systemic absorption of ophthalmic drug could be altered by an inserting direction of the insert in rabbit eyes. One-side-coated insert was prepared by attaching a polypropylene tape on the one side of the polymer disc of poly(2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate) (HPM) containing tilisolol as a model ophthalmic drug. The insert was applied in the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac of albino rabbits with the uncoated side facing bulbar conjunctiva/sclera (SC insert) or palpebral conjunctiva (CJ insert). At the adequate intervals, the tear fluid, plasma, aqueous humor, conjunctiva, and sclera were collected and the drug concentrations were determined by an HPLC. A release of tilisolol from the one-side-coated insert was twice slower than from the uncoated insert. Ocular application of the one-side-coated insert produced the constant concentrations of tilisolol in the tear fluid over 180 min. SC insert showed higher drug concentrations in the aqueous humor and sclera, and lower drug concentrations in the plasma and conjunctiva than CJ insert.The one-side-coated insert can alter the ocular and systemic absorption of drug by an inserting direction.",

Culture-induced DNA synthesis was suppressed to 22.6 and 8.51%, respectively, by 40 and 80 microM carbenoxolone. The other gap-junction blockers failed to affect the morphology and the DNA synthesis of activated HSCs. Carbenoxolone decreased the expression of cyclins D1/2 and cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-elicited DNA synthesis was reduced to 45.6 and 3.27%, respectively, by 40 and 80 microM carbenoxolone. Phosphorylation of c-Raf, MEK and mitogen-activated protein kinase, but not PDGF receptor beta, under PDGF-BB stimulation was attenuated by carbenoxolone. Collagen alpha1(I) mRNA expression was significantly reduced. In addition, carbenoxolone suppressed the activation process of quiescent HSCs.",

    "6": "Intravenous dosing was initially done via jugular cannula. For iontophoretic delivery, current (0.1 mA/cm2) was applied for 2 h through a drug reservoir patch containing the beta-blocker (10 mg/ml). Blood samples were collected and analyzed by stereoselective HPLC assays. Any irritation resulting from patch application was quantified by a chromameter. Multilamellar liposomal formulation was prepared by the thin-film hydration method and converted to unilamellar liposomes by extrusion.", 
    "7": "With transdermal iontophoresis, therapeutically relevant amounts of propranolol (83.78 +/- 7.4 ng/ml) were delivered within an hour and lasted for up to 4 h. Cmax (185.1 +/- 56.8 ng/ml) was reached at hour 3. A significantly higher amount (p < 0.05) of sotalol HCl was delivered compared to other beta-blockers. There was no significant difference in the S/R ratio of AUC0-t for enantiomers after both intravenous and transdermal delivery. Skin irritation was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) when a liposomal formulation of the propranolol base was used rather than the base itself.",

    "10": "In vitro permeation experiments were performed with a mixture of six beta-blockers using an immortalized human corneal epithelial cell culture model. Disappearance of the compounds from the apical donor solution and their appearance in the basolateral receiver solution were determined and used to calculate the corneal absorption and desorption rate constants. An ocular pharmacokinetic simulation model was constructed for timolol with the Stella program using the absorption and desorption rate constants and previously published in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "11": "The corneal absorption rates of beta-blockers increased significantly with the lipophilicity of the compounds. The pharmacokinetic simulation model gave a realistic mean residence time for timolol in the cornea (57 min) and the aqueous humor (90 min). The simulated timolol concentration in the aqueous humor was about 1.8 times higher than the previously published experimental values.", 
    "12": "The simulation model gave a reasonable estimate of the aqueous humor concentration profile of timolol. This was the first attempt to combine cell culture methods and pharmacokinetic modeling for prediction of ocular pharmacokinetics. The wider applicability of this approach remains to be seen.", 
    "13": "Cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been found to augment cerebral blood flow (CBF) in a number of animal models, although the mechanisms underlying the cerebrovascular effects of SCS are poorly described. In this study, the authors examined the role of sympathetic tone in CBF alterations induced by SCS in rats.", 
    "14": "Spinal cord stimulation was performed at three intervals while CBF was monitored with laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Either hexamethonium (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg), prazosin (0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg), idazoxan (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg), propranolol (1, 2, or 4 mg/kg), or vehicle was administered intravenously before the second stimulation. Changes in LDF values due to SCS were recorded as the percentage of change from baseline values and were analyzed. In vehicle-treated animals, SCS increased LDF values by 60.5 +/- 1.8% over baseline, whereas both high-dose hexamethonium and prazosin completely abolished the SCS-induced increases in LDF values. On the other hand, LDF values increased by 50.9 +/- 4% and 61.4 +/- 4% after SCS in the presence of idazoxan or propranolol, respectively. Administration of sympathetic nervous system blockers resulted in a variable degree of systemic hypotension as well. Nevertheless, induced hypotension without sympathetic blockade had only a minimal effect on SCS-induced augmentation of LDF values (48 +/- 1.4% over baseline).", 
    "15": "Sympathetic tone plays a major role in SCS-induced increases in CBF. This effect seems to be mediated primarily by alpha1-adrenergic receptors. Systemic hypotension alone cannot explain the effects of sympathetic blockade on the SCS response. Clinical use of SCS in the treatment of cerebral ischemia should take alpha1-adrenergic receptor sympathetic tone into account.", 
    "16": "In this study, the first experimental investigation carried out at the ultrastructural level on mucous cells of human salivary glands, we have examined by light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), the secretory response of labial glands stimulated in vitro by the beta-adrenergic agent, D,L isoproterenol, and by the muscarinic agent carbachol. For comparison we have used identical methods to study samples of mixed portions of human submandibular glands. Morphological findings obtained here on both submandibular and labial glands mucous cells demonstrate that mucous droplets are released solely by muscarinic stimulation, and that cytological events occurring during secretory discharge are similar to those described by others, using TEM, on stimulated mucous cells of rat sublingual glands. Despite the fact that human labial glands are said to have a prominent cholinergic innervation with scanty adrenergic nerves, the response of seromucous cells in these organs to stimulation with carbachol and with isoproterenol was similar to that observed by us, (using LM, TEM and HRSEM), in serous cells of human major salivary glands.", 
    "17": "Experiments were performed to study the relationship between presynaptic calcium and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) using voltage-clamp technique with whole cell mode in Xenopus optic tectal slices. The results are as follows: The frequency of mIPSCs decreased from 1.91+/-0.59 Hz to 0.34+/-0.09 Hz in calcium-free solution (paired t test, P=0.019, n=8), the value of mIPSCs frequency being (25.5+/-4.4)% of control. In order to rule out the effect of remaining calcium in perfusing solution we further applied calcium-free solution containing egtazic acid, ethyleneglycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N -tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (200 nmol/L-2 mmol/L). The mIPSCs frequency changed from 1.57+/-0.57 in control to 0.89+/-0.41 Hz in calcium-free solution containing EGTA (paired t test, P=0.002, n=12), decreasing to (40.0+/-5.9)% of control. There is no statistical difference in the results between Ca(2+)-free perfusion and Ca(2+)-free solution containing EGTA (paired t test, P=0.74, n=9). When cadmium chloride (CdCl2, 100 micromol/L), a non-specific Ca(2+) channel blocker, was applied to the bath solution, the mIPSCs frequency decreased from 1.15+/-0.34 Hz in control to 0.25+/-0.09 Hz in CdCl2-containing solution (paired t test, P=0.008, n=11), reaching (29.25+/-6.1)% of control. However, the amplitude did not change much. An endoplasmic reticulum pump inhibitor thapsigargin increased the mIPSCs frequency from 0.93+/-0.19 Hz to 1.58+/-0.28 Hz (paired t test, P=0.002, n=11). The value in the latter is (214.6 +/-49.1)% of that in the former. In order to exclude the remaining calcium from the bathing solution, the mIPSCs frequency was first recorded from calcium-free solution as control (0.41+/-0.08 Hz) and then from calcium-free containing TG solution (8-16 micromol/L)(0.71+/-0.15 Hz)(paired t test, P=0.026, n=5), increasing to (175.0+/-14.6)% of control. The endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) store RyR agonist (ryanodine, 10-100 nmol/L) enhanced mIPSCs frequency from 1.18+/-0.40 Hz to 1.80+/-0.44 Hz with increment of (261.8+/-89.5)% (paired t test, P=0.004, n=6). However, the endoplasmic reticulum RyR antagonist (procaine, 2 mmol/L) could inhibit mIPSCs from 1.26+/-0.35 Hz to 0.43+/-0.15 Hz (paired t test, P=0.027, n=6). U73122 (40 micromol/L), a phosphalipase C inhibitor, decreased also mIPSCs frequency from 2.01+/-0.58 Hz in control to 0.92+/-0.40 Hz in U73122-containing solution (paired t test, P=0.002, n=10). Caffeine (10 mmol/L) markedly diminished mIPSCs frequency from 3.22+/-0.64 Hz to 0.15+/-0.30 Hz (paired t test, P=0.003, n=7), which is (4.6+/-2.9)% compared to control. Furthermore, in some cases the caffeine could abolish mIPSCs. Taken together, our results demonstrated that cytosolic calcium might be important for mediating the generation of mIPSCs. The cytosolic calcium could be increased by calcium influx through membrane calcium channel on presynaptic membrane, and/or by calcium released through RyR and IP(3)R in presynaptical internal store. The increased cytosolic Ca(2+) both from external solution or internal Ca(2+) stores might increase the transmitter vesicles at the presynaptic terminal, which in turn results in the increase of the mIPSCs frequency in the postsynaptic neurons.", 
    "18": "The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of an inhibitory effect of nipradilol on cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. After being starved, cultured VSMCs were stimulated by 5% fetal bovine serum with various concentrations of nipradilol. Nipradilol dose-dependently decreased the values of [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation, cell numbers and total cellular protein content, and the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and p38. It also suppressed the level of proliferative cell nuclear antigen in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, nipradilol did not change the level of the phosphorylated value of c-jun NH(2)-terminal protein kinase or cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in VSMCs. These results indicate that nipradilol suppresses cell growth without apoptosis in rat VSMCs, suggesting that it could be effective for preventing the progression of restenosis after angioplasty.", 
    "19": "This study investigated the relative contribution of ion-trapping, microsomal binding, and distribution of unbound drug as determinants in the hepatic retention of basic drugs in the isolated perfused rat liver. The ionophore monensin was used to abolish the vesicular proton gradient and thus allow an estimation of ion-trapping by acidic hepatic vesicles of cationic drugs. In vitro microsomal studies were used to independently estimate microsomal binding and metabolism. Hepatic vesicular ion-trapping, intrinsic elimination clearance, permeability-surface area product, and intracellular binding were derived using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. Modeling showed that the ion-trapping was significantly lower after monensin treatment for atenolol and propranolol, but not for antipyrine. However, no changes induced by monensin treatment were observed in intrinsic clearance, permeability, or binding for the three model drugs. Monensin did not affect binding or metabolic activity in vitro for the drugs. The observed ion-trapping was similar to theoretical values estimated using the pHs and fractional volumes of the acidic vesicles and the pKa values of drugs. Lipophilicity and pKa determined hepatic drug retention: a drug with low pKa and low lipophilicity (e.g., antipyrine) distributes as unbound drug, a drug with high pKa and low lipophilicity (e.g., atenolol) by ion-trapping, and a drug with a high pKa and high lipophilicity (e.g., propranolol) is retained by ion-trapping and intracellular binding. In conclusion, monensin inhibits the ion-trapping of high pKa basic drugs, leading to a reduction in hepatic retention but with no effect on hepatic drug extraction.", 
    "20": "Brinzolamide is a highly specific carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor which lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) by reducing the rate of aqueous humour formation. Formulated as a 1% ophthalmic suspension (Azopt) and administered twice or three times daily, brinzolamide is indicated for the topical management of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular hypertension (OH) as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with topical beta-blockers. As monotherapy in patients with POAG or OH, brinzolamide 1% demonstrated IOP-lowering efficacy that was significantly greater than placebo, equivalent to three-times-daily dorzolamide 2% but significantly lower than twice-daily timolol 0.5%. Brinzolamide 1% was equally effective in twice- and three-times-daily regimens producing diurnal mean IOP reductions from baseline in the range of 13.2-21.8%. When used adjunctively twice daily with timolol 0.5%, brinzolamide 1% was as effective as dorzolamide 2% and superior to placebo in lowering IOP in patients with POAG or OH. In clinical trials, brinzolamide 1% was well tolerated causing only nonserious adverse effects that were generally local, transient and mild to moderate in severity. The incidence of the most common adverse events associated with the use of brinzolamide 1% was either similar to (blurred vision and abnormal taste) or significantly lower than (ocular discomfort) with dorzolamide 2%. Topical brinzolamide 1% does not appear to produce the acid-base or electrolyte disturbances and severe systemic adverse effects characteristic of oral CA inhibitors. It can be used in patients unresponsive to beta-blockers or in whom beta-blockers are contraindicated. Brinzolamide 1% administered twice daily is among the least costly alternatives and adjuncts to beta-blocker therapy for glaucoma and is generally associated with less direct medical cost than dorzolamide.", 
    "21": "Brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension administered twice or three times daily, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with topical beta-blockers, has good IOP-lowering efficacy in patients with POAG or OH that is equivalent to that of dorzolamide 2% (three times daily as monotherapy, twice daily as adjunctive therapy). Brinzolamide is generally well tolerated and does not produce the systemic adverse effects associated with oral CA inhibitors. It can be used in patients who are unresponsive to, intolerant of, or unable to receive, ophthalmic beta-blockers. Thus, brinzolamide, either as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy with topical beta-blockers, should be regarded as a good second-line option in the pharmacological management of POAG and OH, and may be preferred over dorzolamide because of significantly less ocular discomfort.", 
    "22": "1. This study used contractility methods with the portal veins of 5- and 14-week-old Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The SHRs are prehypertensive at 5 weeks. 2. The first part of our study was to determine whether the responsiveness to isoprenaline and forskolin was altered in the maturation of portal veins from normo- and prehypertensive rats. The responses to forskolin were similar on the portal veins of 5- and 14-week-old WKY and SHRs. 3. The sensitivity and maximum responses to isoprenaline were similar on portal veins of 5- and 14-week-old WKY. The sensitivity and maximum responses to isoprenaline were lower on the portal veins of 5-week-old SHRs (pD2 = 8.25, maximum = 85%) than age-matched WKY (pD2 = 8.79, maximum = 96%); these differences are not caused by hypertension. At 14 weeks, the sensitivity was similar (WKY pD2 = 8.74, SHR pD2 = 8.65) but the maximum responses to isoprenaline were lower on the portal veins SHRs (77%) than WKY (97%). Thus, the sensitivity to isoprenaline increases with the development of hypertension in the SHR portal vein. 4. The second part of the study was to determine whether the affinity for isoprenaline at beta2-adrenoceptors and the fractional beta2-adrenoceptor occupancy-response relationships on the portal vein were altered in maturation from normo- and pre-hypertensive rats. The effects of bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM), an irreversible beta-adrenoceptor blocker, on the isoprenaline responses of 5- and 14-week-old WKY and SHRs were studied. Maturation of the WKY portal vein between 5 and 14 weeks was associated with a loss of affinity for isoprenaline (from pKA of 7.13 to 7.87), and increase in beta2-adrenoceptor reserve (from 72 to 92% at the 95% response). There were similar affinity and reserve findings in the maturation of the SHR portal vein. Thus, there are major changes in beta2-adrenoceptor structure and reserve in maturation on the portal vein that are irrespective of the development of hypertension.", 
    "23": "Recent studies have suggested some gender-related differences in the incidence, quality of care, response to therapy, and outcome in heart failure patients. The majority of studies have proposed a better survival for women compared to men. However, the under-representation of women in clinical trials leads to some uncertainty regarding the survival benefit. Some data suggest the possibility that ACE-inhibitors may be less beneficial in women as compared to men. Beta-blockers seem to be effective both in women and men. Further studies are needed to clarify whether these differences may have a pathophysiological basis.", 
    "24": "The influence of physician leaders on their colleagues in local medical communities has been recognized for several decades. However, the literature indicates that little is known about the specific characteristics of physician leaders involved in improving quality in today's hospital environment. A taxonomy of the characteristics of the physician quality leader from the perspective of physicians and nonphysicians was developed.", 
    "25": "Information about physician leaders working to improve acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was gathered from in-depth interviews with 45 key physicians and nursing, quality management, and administrative staff at eight hospitals. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis.",

    "28": "The production of nitric oxide (NO) by constitutive nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was investigated in isolated rat pancreatic islets and dispersed beta-cells. Double-immunocytochemical analyses with a confocal microscope demonstrated the presence of NOS1 in alpha-, beta-, delta-, and PP-cells and that of NOS3 in beta-, delta-, and PP-cells, but not alpha-cells, in the isolated rat islets. Image analyses with the NO-reactive fluorescence dye DAF-2 clearly showed that an elevation in glucose concentrations from 0 to 11.1 mM increased intracellular NO in most cells of the isolated islets. The glucose-induced elevation of intracellular NO in the islet cells was abolished in the presence of the Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine and after treatment with the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine. Similarly, the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker tolbutamide, which elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, increased DAF-2 fluorescence in most cells of the isolated islets. In isolated beta-cells, 11.1 mM glucose increased DAF-2 fluorescence, which was suppressed by NG-nitro-L-arginine and by reducing the glucose concentration to 0 mM. DAF-2 fluorescence in beta-cells was also increased by 50 mM K+, which was suppressed by NG-nitro-L-arginine. These results suggest that NOS1 and NOS3 are present in rat pancreatic beta-cells, and that glucose produces NO by Ca(2+)-dependent activation of the constitutive NOS isoforms.", 
    "29": "The effect of alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha-NF) on vascular function was studied in isolated ring segments of the rat thoracic aorta and in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). alpha-NF induced concentration-dependent relaxation of the phenylephrine-precontracted aorta endothelium-dependently and -independently at lower and higher concentrations, respectively. The cGMP, but not cAMP, content was increased significantly in alpha-NF-treated aorta. Pretreatment with N(omega)-nitro- l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or methylene blue attenuated both alpha-NF induced vasorelaxation and the increase of cGMP content significantly. The increase of cGMP content induced by alpha-NF was also inhibited by chelating extracellular Ca(2+) with EGTA. These results suggest that the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by alpha-NF is mediated most probably through Ca(2+)-dependent activation of NO synthase and guanylyl cyclase. In HUVECs, alpha-NF induced concentration-dependent formation of NO and Ca(2+) influx. alpha-NF-induced NO formation was abolished by removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and by pretreatment with the Ca(2+) channel blockers SKF 96365 and Ni(2+), but not by the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil. The Ca(2+) influx, as measured by (45)Ca(2+) uptake, induced by alpha-NF was also inhibited by SKF 96365 and Ni(2+). Our data imply that alpha-NF, at lower concentrations, induces endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by promoting extracellular Ca(2+) influx in endothelium and the activation of the NO-cGMP pathway.", 
    "30": "Glucocorticoids affect the expression and density of neurotransmitter receptors in many tissues but data concerning the heart are contradictory and incomplete. We injected rats with hydrocortisone for 1-12 days and measured the densities of cardiac muscarinic receptors, alpha(1)-, beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors and propranolol-resistant binding sites (formerly assumed to be the putative beta(4)-adrenoceptor). Some aspects of intracellular signalling were also evaluated: we measured adenylyl cyclase activity (basal, isoprenaline- and forskolin-stimulated and carbachol-inhibited), the coupling between muscarinic receptors and G proteins and basal and isoprenaline-stimulated heart rate. The density of cardiac muscarinic receptors increased (in both the atria and the ventricles). The density of beta(1)-adrenoceptors increased in the atria and was little changed in the ventricles. The density of beta(2)-adrenoceptors increased in both the atria and the ventricles. The number of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors decreased initially, followed by a transient increase in the atria and did not change in the ventricles. The density of propranolol-resistant binding sites first increased and then diminished in the atria and did not change in the ventricles. Although there were noticeable changes in receptor densities, the stimulatory and inhibitory effects on adenylyl cyclase, basal and isoprenaline-stimulated heart rate and the coupling between muscarinic receptors and G proteins were not significantly altered. This may indicate that changes in receptor densities might be one of the mechanisms maintaining stable functional output.",

Patients admitted to cardiology units were younger (56.3% >70 years vs 76.2%, P <.0001), had more severe symptoms (NYHA IV 35% vs 29%, P =.00014), and more often underwent evaluation of ventricular function (89.3% vs 54.8%, P <.0001) and coronary angiography (7.5% vs 0.9%, P <.0001) than those admitted to medical units. Moreover, they were more often prescribed beta-blockers (17.8% vs 8.7%, P <.0001). However, prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (78.7% vs 81.5%, P = not significant [NS]) and inhospital mortality (5.2% vs 5.9%, P = NS) were similar. A 6-month follow-up visit was performed in 56.4% of cases (68.2% of cardiology vs 49.4% of medicine patients, P <.0001); 6-month readmission (43.7% vs 45.4%, P = NS) and mortality (13.9% vs 16.7%, P = NS) rates were similar.", 
    "33": "Patients with heart failure admitted to cardiology and internal medicine units represent 2 clearly different populations. In both groups, diagnostic procedures and evidence-based treatments, such as beta-blockers, appeared to be underused, and there was a lack of structured follow-up, as well as a poor 6-month prognosis.",

Patients with CHF in New York Heart Association class II to IV with an ejection fraction (EF) < or =0.40 and a history of being hospitalized for an acute MI (n = 1926) were randomized to metoprolol succinate controlled release/extended release (CR/XL) versus placebo.

The combined end point of all-cause mortality/hospitalization for worsening CHF was reduced by 31% (95% CI 0.16-0.44, P <.0001), and cardiac death/nonfatal acute MI by 45% (95% CI 0.26-0.58, P <.0001).

    "38": "Critical pathways are standardized protocols for optimizing and streamlining patient care. They are important in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction, many of whom do not receive evidence-based therapies. Several studies have demonstrated that the development and implementation of critical pathways that follow published guidelines and are tailored to the needs and resources of each institution result in increased use of evidence-based therapies, such as aspirin and beta-blockers, and is associated with decreased mortality. Use of these protocols has also been shown to reduce unnecessary therapy and under- or overutilization of certain procedures, thereby resulting in more cost-effective treatment.", 
    "39": "Patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) face a high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, repeat hospitalizations, heart failure, and mortality. There is compelling scientific evidence that antiplatelet therapy, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and lipid-lowering therapy reduce these risks in patients with acute MI. Despite this evidence and national guidelines, a number of studies in a variety of clinical settings have documented that a significant proportion of patients with acute MI is not being treated with these guideline-recommended, evidence-based therapies when receiving conventional care. The demonstration that initiation of cardiovascular protective medications, including lipid-lowering therapy, prior to hospital discharge for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events results in a marked increase in treatment rates, improved long-term patient compliance, and better clinical outcomes has led to the revision of national guidelines to endorse this approach as the standard of care. Physicians have been reluctant to initiate beta-blockers in post-MI patients with significant left ventricular dysfunction and/or heart failure symptoms, and this reluctance has contributed to the treatment gap. Recent studies suggest that when the beta-blocker carvedilol is initiated in acute-MI patients with left ventricular dysfunction with or without symptoms of heart failure prior to hospital discharge, it is safe and effective and improves clinical outcomes. Adopting in-hospital initiation of cardiovascular protective medications as the standard of care for patients hospitalized with acute MI could dramatically improve treatment rates and thus substantially reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events and hospitalizations and prolong life in the large number of patients hospitalized each year.", 
    "40": "The prognosis for patients who suffer myocardial infarctions (MIs) is poor, with 22% of male and 46% of female survivors being disabled by heart failure within 6 years. Many well-established risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality post-MI are closely linked to the metabolic syndrome and associated with over-activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. Results from numerous large-scale clinical endpoint trials have shown that blocking the deleterious effects of these systems with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist significantly reduces the risk of mortality and cardiovascular events in post-MI patients. Results from 1 recent study of the beta-blocker, carvedilol, have shown further that these benefits extend to high-risk patients with either diabetes or hypertension.", 
    "41": "The CAPRICORN (Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control in Left Ventricular Dysfunction) trial established that the beta-blocker carvedilol reduces the risk of death in patients with left ventricular dysfunction post myocardial infarction, whether or not the infarct is complicated by clinical heart failure. Thus, the utility of the beta-blocker carvedilol is confirmed in the modern era as an adjunct to revascularization, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and statins. In addition, the results prompt us to review the prior studies of beta-blockers postinfarction. Critical review of CAPRICORN and earlier beta-blocker studies suggests that specific beta-blockers should be matched to specific clinical scenarios. The COMET (Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial) study reinforces this view by establishing that beta-blockers are not simply interchangeable agents.", 
    "42": "In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (MI), the early use of intravenous beta-blockade followed by short-term oral administration in the absence of reperfusion therapy has shown a modest reduction in mortality. In contrast, major reductions in mortality and reinfarction have been shown when beta-blockers have been used soon after an acute MI and continued long-term. These benefits were observed in trials conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the widespread use of reperfusion therapies, antiplatelet agents, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; those trials excluded patients with postischemic heart failure. Recently, the CAPRICORN trial has shown a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and reinfarction in post-MI patients with systolic dysfunction, in response to carvedilol. In spite of compelling evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in the post-MI setting, data published by the National Cooperative Cardiovascular Project have shown that fewer than half of all post-MI patients receive beta-blockers as long-term therapy. It appears that post-MI patients with perceived contraindications, such as advanced age, diabetes, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and/or chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, may derive a substantial benefit from the use of beta-blockers. Given the considerable evidence from randomized clinical trials, the use of beta-blockers is recommended in all post-MI patients without a contraindication, particularly in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.", 
    "43": "An understanding of the process of left ventricular (LV) remodeling has led to greater knowledge of the pathophysiology of heart failure syndrome. This article examines the relationship between LV remodeling and clinical outcomes of heart failure syndrome from several different perspectives. The studies cited suggest that the post-myocardial infarction process is related to and associated with long-term progression of LV dysfunction, heart failure symptoms, and mortality. It is also demonstrated that drug therapies that slow or reverse the remodeling process appear to have favorable natural history effects in the short term as well as during long-term therapy.", 
    "44": "The clinical benefit of beta blockade has been proven in a variety of pathologic settings, including hypertension, angina pectoris, acute- and post-myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. However, beta blockers do not all share the same clinical outcomes with respect to efficacy or safety in many of these conditions. This is especially true in HF, where differences in reverse remodeling and effects on the periphery may be important differentiating factors leading to improved efficacy. In fact, beta blockers are a heterogeneous group of agents with respect to pharmacology, receptor biology, hemodynamic effects, and tolerability. As cardiovascular disease progresses, the issue of switching from one b blocker to another is an important consideration as to how to optimize the effectiveness of adrenergic blockade. Because of the differences among beta blockers, switching should be conducted in a manner that takes into account pharmacologic differences. For example, the similarities and differences of receptor subtype blockade of the two agents and the potential effects of ancillary properties. Two protocols for switching between carvedilol, a third-generation nonselective agent with vasodilation through alpha1 blockade, and a beta1-selective agent (e.g., metoprolol, atenolol) are described to simplify the process and maximize the safety and tolerability of this procedure. The optimal selection and use of adrenergic-blocking agents in the cardiovascular continuum will assist in providing improved management while minimizing safety and tolerability concerns.", 
    "45": "Beta blockers have been shown to prolong survival in chronic heart failure. It is currently a matter of debate whether any beta blocker is superior to the other in terms of improving symptoms, left ventricular function, or prognosis. A number of comparative studies have been performed with metoprolol, a beta1-selective second-generation beta blocker, and carvedilol, a nonselective and vasodilatative third-generation beta blocker. This review will focus on the different pharmacological profiles of carvedilol and metoprolol as well as on the clinical consequences derived from these differences. The results indicate that in some studies carvedilol is superior to metoprolol in improving left ventricular ejection fraction. However, because there is no conclusive evidence that carvedilol is superior to metoprolol in terms of prognosis, it is not justified to substitute metoprolol with carvedilol. Comparative data on mortality reduction are not available before termination of the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial. Nevertheless, the different effects of both beta blockers on the beta-adrenergic system have an impact on tolerability and beta-adrenergic responsiveness and thus exercise tolerance in heart-failure patients.", 
    "46": "Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials has provided compelling evidence to support the use of beta blockers in most patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. There is little disagreement about the mortality benefit provided by adding beta blockers to standard therapy, which may include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and sometimes digoxin. A few areas are still controversial. The authors review the available literature encompassing four of those controversial areas: 1) the comparability among beta blockers; 2) the utility of beta blockers among patients with New York Heart Association class I and class IV heart failure symptoms; 3) the impact of race on the effectiveness of beta blockers; and 4) the safety and efficacy of beta blockers among patients on concomitant therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or spironolactone.", 
    "47": "Large-scale outcome trials have demonstrated that blood pressure reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) is associated with reduced cardiovascular complications in hypertension. Comparative trials against conventional drugs and between ACE inhibitors and CCBs have failed to reveal conclusive differences in cause-specific outcomes. Studies in high-risk patients suggest that ACE inhibitors are superior to CCBs and other drugs in protection against cardiovascular events and renal disease. Very long-term prospectively collected observational data from the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic and the UK General Practice Research Database strongly support an advantage of ACE inhibitors over CCBs for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Considering all the available information, it can be concluded that the use of CCBs in the routine therapy of hypertension cannot be recommended while wider use of ACE inhibitors, along with low-dose diuretics and beta blockers, appears justified.", 
    "48": "Effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment depends not only on drugs that avoid or minimize symptomatic side effects but also on therapy that has a positive effect on quality of life. This study assessed the effect on quality of life of a contemporary agent (an angiotensin receptor blocker) and evaluated the validity and practicality of using a quality-of-life instrument in the practice-based setting. A total of 2716 hypertensive patients, either untreated or on single-agent therapy, were started on or switched to 40 mg telmisartan for 6 weeks; in patients whose blood pressures remained above 130/85 mm Hg after 2 weeks, the dose was increased to 80 mg for the remaining 4 weeks of treatment. Quality of life was measured by patient self-administration of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (GWBI) at baseline and at the end of the study. Sixty-eight percent (n=1858) of patients treated with telmisartan fully completed both GWBI tests; the test score increased by 5.2+/-0.3 (p<0.0001) from 77.7+/-0.4. This improvement was observed across all six emotional and health subscales of the GWBI. White and black patients, those aged <65 or >/=65 years, and men and women had similar increases, though the baseline value in women was sharply lower (p<0.001) than in men. The GWBI rose more in patients whose blood pressure was controlled by treatment (<140/90 mm Hg) than in noncontrolled patients (6.1 vs. 4.1, p<0.0001); for all patients the decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures produced by telmisartan correlated significantly (p<0.001 for each) with the increases in the GWBI scores. Controlling blood pressure appears to be an important element in improving subjective health perceptions of hypertensive patients.",

Patients underwent one Tc-99m sestamibi study at rest on a separate day. The interval between DMPI studies was <or=14 days. Images were interpreted by three observers blinded to clinical data using a 17-segment, five-point model.

    "59": "The success of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure has led to investigations of other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although ACE inhibitors remain first-line drugs in the treatment of heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction, clinical evidence suggests that a newer class of agents--angiotensin II receptor blockers--may provide additional benefit by blocking the adverse effects of angiotensin II more completely. An improved adverse-effect profile also makes angiotensin II receptor blockers appropriate in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers on the combined endpoints of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Aldosterone antagonism with spironolactone has additive benefits in patients receiving an ACE inhibitor. The most recent treatment guidelines for heart failure recommend the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers and spironolactone in selected patients.", 
    "60": "The effects of beta blocker therapy in the settings of heart failure and coronary artery disease have been well described, although little data exist in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The current study will attempt to evaluate the efficacy of beta blocker therapy in this setting. Pooled data from five randomized, controlled trials of abciximab during coronary intervention were used to analyze the clinical efficacy of beta blocker therapy. The pooled analysis evaluated the end points of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, and the combined endpoint of death and myocardial infarction in 2,894 patients. At 30 days, death occurred in 12 of 1,939 (0.6%) patients receiving beta blocker therapy and in 19 of 955 (2.0%) patients not receiving beta blocker therapy, (P < 0.001). At 6 months, death occurred in 33 of 1,939 (1.7%) patients receiving beta blocker therapy and 35 of 955 (3.7%) not receiving beta blocker therapy, (P < 0.001). After creating a propensity model and adjusting for variables predictive of mortality in the multivariable analysis, beta blocker therapy continued to be associated with a significant reduction in mortality. The findings were similar to those shown for the effects of beta blocker therapy in separate subgroups of patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. This analysis demonstrates a lower short-term mortality in patients receiving beta blocker therapy who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention for unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction.",

Preserved and preservative-free carteolol as well as preserved latanoprost did not worsen or prevent complement activation induced by zymosan or aggregated IgG. Unexpectedly, both preserved and unpreserved timolol and betaxolol significantly counteracted the effects of complement activators. Timolol prevented activation triggered by both IgG and zymosan to the same extent (24% to 29%), despite the presence of BAK in the preserved formulation. Betaxolol was twice as effective at preventing the effect of IgG (34% to 37%) than that of zymosan (14%), regardless of the presence of BAK. However, BAK itself strongly aggravated complement activation by both activators.",

On the contrary, the beta-blockers timolol and betaxolol exerted an anti-inflammatory effect by preventing complement activation.

Our study suggests that inflammatory signs in glaucoma patients should not be attributed to complement activation by antiglaucoma drugs.", 
    "65": "Neuromedin U activates noradrenergic neurones in the medulla oblongata and oxytocin neurones in the hypothalamus. Here we examined roles of noradrenergic transmission in oxytocin release from the pituitary after intracerebroventricular administration of neuromedin U in rats. Neuromedin U administration facilitated noradrenaline release in the supraoptic nucleus. Administration of a beta1 adrenoceptor antagonist, metoprolol, or a beta2 antagonist, ICI 118551 but not an alpha1 antagonist, benoxathian, reduced increases in plasma oxytocin concentrations observed after administration of neuromedin U, but plasma ACTH concentrations were not significantly changed. All theses data suggest that neuromedin U stimulates oxytocin release from the pituitary, at least in part, via activation of beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "66": "This study was performed to elucidate the protection afforded by post-treatment with Betoptic (0.25% betaxolol) against neuronal cell damage after ischemia/reperfusion insult in rats. Betaxolol was applied topically after the start of reperfusion and its effect was evaluated by morphometry and choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity of retinas at 7 days after reperfusion. In non-treated eyes, the thickness of the inner plexiform layer decreased markedly after a reperfusion period of both 3 and 7 days. However, when eyes were treated with betaxolol after ischemia/reperfusion injury, both the reduction of the inner plexiform layer thickness and the retinal choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity were significantly attenuated. These findings suggest that betaxolol is an efficient neuroprotective agent and prevents the retinal cell damage induced by ischemic injury in rats.",

The hypotension produced by 6 mg/kg dose of the extract was blocked by propranolol but not by atropine or mepyramine maleate. This indicates that muscarinic or histaminergic mechanisms are not likely to be involved in the hypotension produced by the extract. The blockade by propranolol of the hypotension produced by T. arjuna indicates that the extract might contain active compound(s) possessing adrenergic beta2-receptor agonist action and/or that act directly on the heart muscle.",

These drugs have traditionally been considered contraindicated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study was to assess the effect of cardioselective beta-blockers on respiratory function of patients with COPD. Comprehensive searches were performed of the EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL databases from 1966 to May 2001, and identified articles and related reviews were scanned. Randomised, blinded, controlled trials that studied the effects of cardioselective beta-blockers on the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or symptoms in patients with COPD were included in the analysis. Interventions studied were the administration of beta-blocker, given either as a single dose or for longer duration, and the use of beta2-agonist given after the study drug. Outcomes measured were the change in FEV1 from baseline and the number of patients with respiratory symptoms. Eleven studies of single-dose treatment and 8 of continued treatment were included. Cardioselective beta-blockers produced no significant change in FEV1 or respiratory symptoms compared to placebo, given as a single dose (-2.05% [95% CI, -6.05% to 1.96%]) or for longer duration (-2.55% [CI, -5.94% to 0.84]), and did not significantly affect the FEV1 treatment response to beta2-agonists. Subgroup analyses revealed no significant change in results for those participants with severe chronic airways obstruction or for those with a reversible obstructive component. In conclusion, cardioselective beta-blockers given to patients with COPD do not produce a significant reduction in airway function or increase the incidence of COPD exacerbations. Given their demonstrated benefit in conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease and hypertension, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered for patients with COPD.",

After baseline tilt test, propranolol in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight was administered intravenously and the tilt test was repeated.

The extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway refers to the conversion of cAMP to AMP by ectophosphodiesterase, followed by metabolism of AMP to adenosine by ecto-5'-nucleotidase, with all steps occurring in the extracellular compartment. The goal of this study was to assess whether the extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway exists in CDs. Studies were conducted in both freshly isolated CDs and in CD cells in culture (first passage) that were derived from isolated CDs. Purity of CDs was confirmed by microscopy, by Western blotting for aquaporin-1, aquaporin-2, bumetanide-sensitive cotransporter type 1, and thiazide-sensitive cotransporter; and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for adenosine receptors. Both freshly isolated CDs and CD cells in culture converted exogenous cAMP to AMP and adenosine. In both freshly isolated CDs and CD cells in culture, conversion of cAMP to AMP and adenosine was affected by a broad-spectrum phosphodiesterase inhibitor (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), an ectophosphodiesterase inhibitor (1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine), and a blocker of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (alpha,beta-methylene-adenosine-5'-diphosphate) in a manner consistent with exogenous cAMP being processed by the extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway. In CD cells in culture, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase increased extracellular concentrations of cAMP, AMP, and adenosine, and these changes were also modulated by the aforementioned inhibitors in a manner consistent with the extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway. In conclusion, the extracellular cAMP-adenosine pathway is an important source of adenosine in CDs.",

Receptor-independent activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by plasma membrane-associated nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) has been demonstrated in vivo, and elevated levels of NDPK were found in purified sarcolemmal membranes of patients with end-stage heart failure. 2. Among 22 consecutive patients with chronic heart failure who underwent cardiac transplantation, those treated with a beta-blocker (n=8) had a 65% lower NDPK content and activity in the cardiac sarcolemma, compared to patients with similar base line characteristics who had no beta-blocker therapy (n=14). 3. The lower NDPK was associated with a reduced NDPK-dependent, Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, as assessed by in vitro measurement of adenylyl cyclase activity in the presence of GDP or its kinase-resistant analog guanosine 5'-O-(2-thio)diphosphate (GDPbetaS). 4. We further tested whether treatment with a beta-adrenergic agonist would induce an increase in sarcolemmal NDPK. Rats treated with isoproterenol developed myocardial hypertrophy, and NDPK in the sarcolemma rose by 60% during 14 days of treatment. The beta-blocker propranolol prevented both effects. When hypertrophy was induced with thyroid hormone, NDPK did not increase. 5. In conclusion, chronic activation of beta-adrenergic receptors increases the binding of NDPK to cardiac sarcolemma, where it may activate heterotrimeric G proteins.",

Distinctions were made between the pharmacological and toxicological effects of these drugs and the adequacy of physicochemical characteristics of its habitat (reconstituted water). Video microscopy and digital image processing were used to study the pharmacological effects on the heart. D. magna exhibited the expected sensitivity to the reference toxicant sodium dodecyl sulfate with a LC(50) of 15.6+/-4.5 mg/l. All drugs were toxic with 48 h-LC(50) of 2.03 mg/l ouabain, 7.04 mg/l verapamil, 32.45 mg/l metaproterenol and 76.21 mg/l metoprolol. Ouabain was the most toxic and caused a positive concentration-dependent inotropic effect. Verapamil caused positive chronotropic and inotropic effects, while metaproterenol showed positive concentration-dependent chronotropic effects at high concentrations (10(-3) and 10(-4) M). Metoprolol induced a positive chronotropic effect at low concentrations (10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6) M) and a negative chronotropic effect at high concentration (10(-4) M). Ouabain, metaproterenol and metoprolol in D. magna caused similar effects to those produced in mammals. In contrast, verapamil caused opposite effects. The results suggest the presence of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase receptors to verapamil and of non-specific adrenergic receptors in heart of D. magna.",

    "92": "Although beta-blockers can not be used for the treatment of vasospastic angina, the effect of beta-blockers with vasorelaxant property on coronary vasospasm remains uncertain. In this study, we evaluated the effect of betaxolol, a new beta-blocker with calcium antagonistic property, as an additional therapy on vasospastic angina (VSA) with anginal attacks on effort. We enrolled 12 patients with VSA and anginal attacks with ST segment depression during exercise stress test. All patients received 1.25-5 mg of betaxolol for 3 months. Treadmill exercise stress test and adenosine triphosphate stress thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy were performed before and 3 months after the onset of the betaxolol treatment. The other drugs including calcium antagonists, nitrates and nicorandil were continued. No patients experienced the exacerbation of angina during the betaxolol treatment. Exercise time to chest pain (317.5+/-72.1-454.2+/-75.5 s, P<0.01) and maximal ST segment depression (1.67+/-0.67-1.16+/-0.46 mm, P<0.01) obtained by exercise stress test, the defect score (8.6+/-2.7-5.3+/-2.1, P<0.01), the extent score (14.8+/-5.8-8.8+/-4.6%, P<0.01), the severity score (17.5+/-7.3-11.3+/-5.2, P<0.01) and washout rate (31.4+/-5.6-37.6+/-5.0%, P<0.01) obtained by the scintigraphy were improved by betaxolol. Our results suggest that betaxolol increases regional myocardial blood flow and improves exercise capacity in patients with VSA. Betaxolol may become a drug for a new potential therapy for VSA.",

The purpose of this study was twofold: to determine if response AC/A ratios vary with refractive error and with myopic progression rate in Hong Kong Chinese children, and to determine the effect of beta-adrenergic antagonism with topical timolol application on AC/A ratios.", 
    "94": "Thirty children aged eight to 12 years participated in the study. All refractive errors were corrected with spectacle lenses. Accommodative responses were measured using a Shin-Nippon autorefractor and concurrent changes in vergence were assessed using a vertical prism and a Howell-Dwyer card at three metres and 0.33 metre. Accommodative demand was altered using plus or minus two dioptre lenses and lens- and distance-induced response AC/A ratios were calculated. Measurements were repeated 30 minutes after the instillation of topical timolol maleate (0.5 per cent).", 
    "95": "AC/A ratios appeared higher in progressing myopic children but the difference was not statistically significant. Timolol application reduced accommodative convergence (AC) in the stable myopes (reduction = -3 +/- 1.14 prism dioptres) but not in the emmetropes (0.69 +/- 0.96 prism dioptres) or progressing myopes (0.16 +/- 0.43 prism dioptres) and this difference between refractive groups was statistically significant (F(2, 27) = 3.766; P = 0.036). However, timolol did not produce a significant change in the accommodative response to positive or negative lenses or response AC/A ratios.", 
    "96": "We did not find that AC/A ratios in myopic Chinese children were elevated and therefore, it is unlikely that elevated AC/A ratios are responsible for the high levels of myopia that occur in Hong Kong. The finding that timolol reduced AC in the stable myopes suggests that the autonomic control of accommodative convergence in these children may be different from that in emmetropic children and those with progressing myopia.",

Plasma protein binding of this drug was determined in vitro and in vivo. AUC0-infinity values for radioactivity and NS-7 after the intravenous administration of 14C-NS-7 to male rats increased with the dose, namely from 0.04 to 5 mg/kg (radioactivity) and from 0.2 to 5 mg/kg (NS-7), indicating the linearity of the drug's pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentrations of the unchanged drug after the intravenous injection of 0.2 mg/kg 14C-NS-7 decreased biexponentially, respective t1/2 beta values being 15.9 h in the male and 22.4 h in the female rats. The t1/2 beta values difference in the males and females might be due to sex differences in NS-7 metabolism. Urinary and fecal excretions of radioactivity within 168 h of administration were 33.0 and 61.4% of the dose in the male and 35.0 and 53.2% in the female rats. No radioactivity was detected in air exhaled from the males and females collected for 168 h after NS-7 administration. Within 24 h of administration, respective biliary excretions for the male and female rats were 26.1 and 11.9% of the dose. Of this excreted radioactivity, 34.9% was reabsorbed in the males. NS-7 plasma concentrations decreased biexponentially after intravenous administration of 0.2 mg/kg 14C-NS-7 to dogs and monkeys. The elimination half-life was 18 h for the dogs and 9.52 h for the monkeys. Urinary and fecal excretions of radioactivity within 168 h of administration were 24.2 and 70.0% of the dose for the dogs, and 63.3 and 24.8% for the monkeys. These species differences in excretion may be due to differences in urinary metabolite compositions. In vitro protein binding of NS-7 showed no marked species differences and was independent of the NS-7 concentration. Binding of 14C-NS-7 in the sera of rats, dogs, monkeys and humans was 90.7%, 73.5% 79.0% and 87.1%, respectively. Binding to human serum albumin, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and lipoprotein was 56.2%, 45.4% and 79.5%, in the range of 4-40 ng/ml. In vivo binding in rat serum 5 min, 6 h and 24 h after the intravenous injection of 14C-NS-7(0.2 mg/kg) ranged from 89.6 to 90.6%.",

Basal leg vascular resistance was higher in SCI than in control subjects (41+/-6 arbitrary units [AU] versus 24+/-4 AU; P=0.034). The same accounts for minimal leg vascular resistance, assessed during reactive hyperemia, which was higher in SCI compared with control subjects (6.9+/-1.0 AU versus 2.5+/-0.2 AU; P<0.01). The maximal phentolamine-induced reduction in leg vascular resistance normalized to each individual's minimal resistance did not differ between the groups (68+/-17% and 51+/-4% for SCI and control subjects, respectively; P>0.1).

Although celiprolol, a specific beta1-antagonist with weak beta2-agonistic action, stimulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) production, the mechanisms remain to be determined. Because it was recently reported that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effector Akt are implicated in the activation of eNOS and that regulation of VCAM-1 expression is mediated via nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), we hypothesized that celiprolol activates phosphorylation of eNOS through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway; that celiprolol modulates VCAM-1 expression, which is associated with inhibiting NF-kappaB phosphorylation; and that celiprolol suppresses NAD(P)H oxidase p22phox, p47phox, gp91phox, and nox1 expression in the left ventricle of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. eNOS and Akt phosphorylation upregulated by celiprolol alone were suppressed by treatment with celiprolol plus wortmannin. Increased expression of VCAM-1, p22phox, p47phox, gp91phox, nox1, activated p65 NF-kappaB, c-Src, p44/p42 extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and their downstream effector p90 ribosomal S6 kinase phosphorylation in DOCA rats was inhibited by celiprolol. Celiprolol administration resulted in a significant improvement in cardiovascular remodeling and suppression of transforming growth factor-beta1 gene expression. In conclusion, celiprolol suppresses VCAM-1 expression because of inhibition of oxidative stress, NF-kappaB, and signal transduction, while increasing eNOS via stimulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and improving cardiovascular remodeling.",

SD of NN intervals, spectral indexes, the short-term fractal scaling exponent (alpha(1)), power-law slope (beta), and turbulence onset and slope were measured in 600 patients at 5 to 7 days after AMI and in 416 patients at 12 months after AMI. In the multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical variables, only reduced fractal HR indexes, alpha1 and beta (p <0.01 for both), turbulence onset, and slope (p <0.05 for both), measured at the convalescent phase after AMI, predicted subsequent cardiac death. All time-domain and spectral HR variability indexes and turbulence onset increased significantly during the 12-month period after AMI (p <0.001 for all), whereas the fractal indexes and turbulence slope remained unchanged. Late after AMI, reduced beta (p <0.05) and turbulence slope (p <0.01) were the only independent predictors of cardiac mortality. Traditional time-domain and spectral measurements of HR variability and turbulence onset improved significantly after AMI, whereas the fractal HR dynamics and turbulence slope remained stable.

Mice overexpressing cardiac AC(VI) were generated using the alphaMHC promoter and studied 10 days after implantation of telemetry devices. Cardiac transgene AC(VI) presence and expression was verified using PCR, RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Ambulatory heart rates were assessed using time and frequency domain analysis over two 24 hour light-dark cycles. Heart rates then were assessed following pharmacological blockade. Time domain analyses showed ambulatory heart rates were unchanged (AC(VI): 597 +/- 15 (SEM) bpm, Control: 595 +/- 12 bpm; p = 0.92).

Mechanical stress, which acts on the posterior ligaments, is thought to be an important factor in the progression of OPLL. To elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the effects of in vitro sinusoidal cyclic stretch (120% peak to peak, at 1 Hz) on cultured spinal ligament cells derived from OPLL and non-OPLL patients. The mRNA expressions of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, BMP-4, and BMP receptors as well as ALP activity in cell layers and production of BMPs into the conditioned medium were significantly increased by cyclic stretch in OPLL cells, whereas no change was observed in non-OPLL cells. A stretch-activated Ca(2+) channel blocker, Gd(3+), the voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channel blockers diltiazem and nifedipine, and Ca(2+)-free medium suppressed stretch-induced ALP activity, which suggests a role of Ca(2+) influx in the signal transduction of mechanical stress to the osteogenic response of OPLL cells.

In such cases it is likely that hypertension is at least partly maintained by pathophysiologic mechanisms other than volume and the renin-angiotensin system, and therefore, that pharmacotherapy directed at other mechanisms is needed. One such form of hypertension is the often overlooked entity of neurogenic hypertension. The purpose of this article is to renew attention to this overlooked entity, to provide a very clinically oriented overview of its possible causes and manifestations, and to discuss the potentially important treatment implications of recognizing this form of hypertension. These implications underscore the need for further clinical and research attention concerning neurogenically mediated hypertension.",

We systematically analyzed all available outcome studies and found no evidence that beta-blocker based therapy, despite lowering blood pressure, reduced the risk of heart attacks or strokes. Despite the inefficacy of beta-blockers, the incidence of adverse effects is substantial. In the MRC study, for every heart attack or stroke prevented, three patients withdrew from atenolol because of impotence, and another seven withdrew because of fatigue. Thus the risk/benefit ratio of beta-blockers is characterized by lack of efficacy and multiple adverse effects.

The method is based on the direct separation of the enantiomers of drugs on a laboratory-made chiral stationary phase (CSP) containing covalently bonded teicoplanin (TE) as chiral selector. Detection of the effluent was performed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, run in the selected-ion recording (SIR) mode. The method was applied to the pharmacokinetic monitoring of sotalol (STL) in the plasma of five young healthy volunteers, dosed with racemic drug. The limits of quantitation (LOQ) reached 4 ng/ml for both sotalol enantiomers. Such a method, fully validated, offers a novel, fast and very efficient tool for the direct determination of sotalol enantiomers in human plasma, and can be generally applied to the beta-adrenergic blockers stereoselective pharmacokinetics.",

    "147": "Patients presenting with unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEM) have a highly variable course. Optimal management is critical because of the high risk of death or myocardial infarction (MI) in the ensuing 30 days. In this article, we review the therapeutic options available to clinicians. Anti-ischemic therapy with beta-blockers and nitrates should be considered in all patients without contraindications. Aspirin remains a cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy and has been shown to substantially reduce the risk of death or MI. Although the data are less robust, unfractionated heparin (UFH) also appears to be efficacious, and the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin appears to be superior to UFH. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, highly beneficial in the setting of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), should be considered in patients with continuing ischemia or other high-risk features. The ADP receptor blocker clopidogrel has been shown to be beneficial in patients who are managed conservatively and in those who undergo PCI. Lastly, a strategy of early angiography should be considered in patients with recurrent ischemia or in those who present with high-risk features such as elevated troponins or ST deviation. Thus, early risk stratification using clinical features, electrocardiographic data, and biomarkers allows identification of subgroups of patients who are not only at high risk but also enjoy the greatest benefits from these aggressive therapies and thereby enables clinicians to target these interventions most effectively.",

    "166": "N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play key roles in both physiological processes, particularly synaptic plasticity, and in neuropathological states such as epilepsy and acute neurodegeneration. R-(R*,S*)-alpha-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenyl-methyl)-1-piperidine propanol (RO 25-6981), is a high-affinity and selective blocker of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit. Using site-directed mutagenesis, [3H]RO 25-6981 binding, Xenopus oocyte voltage-clamp recordings, and molecular modeling, we have identified several critical residues involved in the RO 25-6981 binding site within the N-terminal LIVBP-like domain of the human NR2B subunit. Two mutations, NR2B(D101A) and NR2B(F176A), resulted in a complete loss of [3H]RO 25-6981 binding and also abolished the high-affinity RO 25-6981-mediated inhibition of NMDA-induced currents. The mutation NR2B(T233A) led to a marked reduction in binding affinity by 13-fold. Mutations F182A, D104A, or K234A had a more moderate influence on the binding affinity (KD values increased by 8-, 7-, and 6-fold, respectively). In a three-dimensional model of the NR2B LIVBP-like domain based on the X-ray crystal structure of the amino-terminal domain of the mGlu1 receptor, the critical residues are located in the central cleft where interaction with RO 25-6981 may stabilize the closed structure of the domain. Our results suggest that the three amino acids Asp-101, Phe-176, and Thr-233 are important molecular determinants for the high-affinity binding of RO 25-6981 to the LIVBP-like domain of human NR2B. A possible binding mode for RO 25-6981 is proposed.", 
    "167": "The disposition kinetics of O-butyryl propranolol (butyryl-PL), a model compound containing an ester moiety, after intravenous administration was compared with that of PL in rats and beagle dogs. Rats showed only 30% conversion of butyryl-PL to PL up to 2 h after dosing, whereas dogs showed nearly complete conversion within 10 min after administration. The CL(total) of butyryl-PL in rats was 5.8 l/h/kg and that in dogs was 65.6 +/- 18.6 l/h/kg, both of which were greater than hepatic blood flow. The in vivo conversion from butyryl-PL to PL in the rat could be explained on the basis of the hydrolysis characteristics in the liver and blood. The in vitro hydrolysis data and the in vivo data after intra-arterial administration clearly demonstrated that the extremely high CL(total) of butyryl-PL in dogs was dependent on first-pass hydrolysis in the lung in addition to hydrolysis at a blood flow-limited rate in the liver and kidney. The availability of butyryl-PL after passage through the lung was 50%. Furthermore, the isoform of carboxylesterase involved in the pulmonary hydrolysis of butyryl-PL in the dog was identified as D1, a CES-1 group enzyme. However, butyryl-PL was not recognized as a substrate by CES-1 family carboxylesterases, which are present at high levels in the rat lung (RH-1) and kidney (RL-1). These findings indicate that extrahepatic metabolism, especially in the lung, is important in the disposition of drugs containing an ester moiety after intravenous administration and that the substrate specificity of carboxylesterase isozyme distinguishes from others.", 
    "168": "Calsenilin has been identified as a presenilin-binding protein, a transcription factor regulating dynorphin expression, and a beta-subunit of Kv4 channels and could, thus, be a multifunctional protein. To study these functions of calsenilin in vivo and to determine the neuroanatomical expression pattern of calsenilin, we generated mice with a disruption of the calsenilin gene by the targeted insertion of the beta-galactosidase gene. We found that calsenilin expression (as represented by beta-galactosidase activity) is very restricted but overlaps better with that of presenilins and Kv4 channels than with dynorphin, suggesting that calsenilin may regulate presenilin and Kv4 channels in brain. Abeta peptide levels are reduced in calsenilin knock-out mice, demonstrating that calsenilin affects presenilin-dependent gamma-cleavage in vivo. Furthermore, long-term potentiation (LTP) in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, in which calsenilin is strongly and selectively expressed, is enhanced in calsenilin knock-out mice. This enhancement of LTP coincides with a downregulation of the Kv4 channel-dependent A-type current and can be mimicked in wild-type animals by a Kv4 channel blocker. The data presented here show that lack of calsenilin affects both Abeta formation and the A-type current. We suggest that these effects are separate events, caused by a common mechanism possibly involving protein transport.",

Regression analysis of the 58 patients showed that on day 0, PRL levels were dependent on the ACTH plasma levels on day 0, the time of the collection of the blood sample and the age. On day 42, the PRL levels were dependent on the ACTH levels and the time of the blood collection but not on the age. Patients with lower baseline ACTH levels on day 0 displayed a better clinical outcome when taking the combination of milnacipran and pindolol as shown in the differences in MADRS on day 42.

    "173": "Intense or chronic stress can produce pathophysiological alterations in the systems involved in the stress response. The amygdala is a key component of the brain's neuronal network that processes and assigns emotional value to life's experiences, consolidates the memory of emotionally significant events, and organizes the behavioral response to these events. Clinical evidence indicates that certain stress-related affective disorders are associated with changes in the amygdala's excitability, implicating a possible dysfunction of the GABAergic system. An important modulator of the GABAergic synaptic transmission, and one that is also central to the stress response is norepinephrine (NE). In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that stress impairs the noradrenergic modulation of GABAergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). In control rats, NE (10 microM) facilitated spontaneous, evoked, and miniature IPSCs in the presence of beta and alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonists. The effects of NE were not blocked by alpha(1D) and alpha(1B) adrenoceptor antagonists, and were mimicked by the alpha(1A) agonist, A61603 (1 microM). In restrain/tail-shock stressed rats, NE or A61603 had no significant effects on GABAergic transmission. Thus, in the BLA, NE acting via presynaptic alpha(1A) adrenoceptors facilitates GABAergic inhibition, and this effect is severely impaired by stress. This is the first direct evidence of stress-induced impairment in the modulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission. The present findings provide an insight into possible mechanisms underlying the antiepileptogenic effects of NE in temporal lobe epilepsy, the hyperexcitability and hyper-responsiveness of the amygdala in certain stress-related affective disorders, and the stress-induced exacerbation of seizure activity in epileptic patients.", 
    "174": "We have reexamined the muscarinic receptor subtype mediating carbachol-induced contraction of rat urinary bladder and investigated the role of phospholipase (PL)C, D, and A2 and of intra- and extracellular Ca2+ sources in this effect. Based on the nonsubtype-selective tolterodine, the highly M2 receptor-selective (R)-4-[2-[3-(4-methoxy-benzoylamino)-benzyl]-piperidin-1-ylmethyl]-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid amide (Ro-320-6206), and the highly M3 receptor-selective darifenacin and 3-(1-carbamoyl-1,1-diphenylmethyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenylethyl)pyrrolidine (APP), contraction occurs via M3 receptors. Carbachol stimulated inositol phosphate formation in rat bladder slices, and this was abolished by the phospholipase C inhibitor 1-(6-[([17beta]-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5[10]-trien-17-yl)-amino]hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U 73,122; 10 microM). Nevertheless, U 73,122 (1-10 microM) did not significantly affect carbachol-stimulated bladder contraction. Carbachol had only little effect on PLD activity in bladder slices, but the PLD inhibitor butan-1-ol, relative to its negative control butan-2-ol (0.3% each), caused detectable inhibition of carbachol-induced bladder contraction. The cytosolic PLA2 inhibitor arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone weakly inhibited carbachol-induced contraction at a concentration of 300 microM, but the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (1-10 microM) remained without effect. The Ca2+ entry blocker nifedipine (10-100 nM) almost completely inhibited carbachol-induced bladder contraction. In contrast, 1-[beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-imidazole HCl (SKF 96,365; 10 microM), an inhibitor of store-operated Ca2+ channels, caused little inhibition. We conclude that carbachol-induced contraction of rat bladder largely depends on Ca2+ entry through nifedipine-sensitive channels and, perhaps, PLD, PLA2, and store-operated Ca2+ channels, whereas cyclooxygenase and, surprisingly, also PLC are not involved to a relevant extent.",

Patients were included if they were hemodynamically stable and required bronchodilator therapy every four hours; patients were excluded if they were maintained on a beta-blocker. Four hours after the most recent bronchodilator treatment, each patient was randomized to receive at least two consecutive doses of albuterol 2.5 mg or levalbuterol 1.25 mg four hours apart via nebulization.

Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats treated with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a non-selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, injected intracerebroventricularly (250 microg/1 microl) 30 min before lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1.5 mg/kg i.v. injection. One hour after LPS administration we observed a significant drop in body temperature (hypothermic response), followed by a temperature increase after the second hour (febrile response), which remained until the end of the experiment. Increased plasmatic AVP levels were concomitantly observed during hypothermia, nearly returning to basal levels during the febrile phase. When L-NAME was administered with LPS, plasmatic AVP concentrations remained high throughout the experiment, hypothermia was accentuated and the febrile response was abolished. Additionally, pre-treatment with beta-mercapto-beta,beta-cyclopentamethylenepropionyl1, O-Et-Tyr2, Val4, Arg8-vasopressin, an AVP V1 receptor blocker (10 microg/kg) administered i.v., reduced hypothermia and exacerbated the febrile response to endotoxin. In conclusion, our data indicate that the central NO pathway plays an inhibitory role in AVP release during experimental septic shock, which seems to be critical for the thermoregulation during this pathophysiological state.", 
    "181": "Sudden cardiac death remains a major health issue in western countries as well as in Hong Kong. Despite increasing knowledge of the mechanisms and risk factors of sudden cardiac death, methods for identifying high-risk candidates and predicting the efficacy of measures to prevent sudden cardiac death are still inadequate. A significant proportion of patients have known heart disease but are generally considered to be at low risk for this event. More efforts are needed to improve the success rate of out-of-hospital resuscitation through better warning systems, the use of amiodarone for refractory arrhythmias, and the widespread availability of automated defibrillation devices to allow early defibrillation. It is likely that these measures could increase the number of survivors following cardiac arrest. In survivors of sudden cardiac death episodes, treatment of the underlying cardiac disease, especially early revascularisation for myocardial ischaemia, is required. In the majority of patients, implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, with or without the use of an anti-arrhythmic drug such as amiodarone, would then be used to maintain survival. Furthermore, for individuals at significant risk of sudden cardiac death, primary prevention of sudden cardiac death through the placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is increasingly being used.",

We investigated the role of ATP in enteric transmission in circular muscle strips of the mouse jejunum. 2. On PGF2alpha-precontracted muscle strips and in the presence of atropine and guanethidine, electrical field stimulation (EFS, 1-8 Hz) of nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerves induced transient relaxations that were abolished by the nerve-conductance blocker tetrodotoxin. The NO synthase blocker l-nitroarginine (l-NOARG) partially inhibited the NANC relaxations to EFS, but fast-twitch relaxations to EFS were still observed in the presence of l-NOARG. 3. In the presence of l-NOARG, ATP, the P2X receptor agonist alphabetaMeATP and the P2Y receptor agonist ADPbetaS relaxed jejunal muscle strips. Tetrodotoxin did not affect the relaxation to ATP and ADPbetaS, but inhibited that to alphabetaMeATP. 4. The l-NOARG-resistant NANC relaxations to EFS were almost abolished by apamin, a blocker of small-conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channels, and by suramin and PPADS, blockers of P2 purinoceptors. Relaxations to ATP were almost abolished by apamin and suramin but not affected by PPADS. 5. Desensitisation of alphabetaMeATP-sensitive P2X receptors, the P2X receptor blocker Evans blue and the P2X1,2,3 receptor blocker NF 279 inhibited the l-NOARG-resistant NANC relaxations to EFS and that to alphabetaMeATP without affecting the relaxation to ADPbetaS. Brilliant blue G, a P2X2,5,7 receptor blocker, did not affect the relaxations to EFS. 6. Desensitisation of P2Y receptors and MRS 2179, a P2Y1 receptor blocker, virtually abolished the l-NOARG-resistant NANC relaxations to EFS and the relaxation to ADPbetaS without affecting the relaxation to alphabetaMeATP. 7. Dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake inhibitor, or theophylline and 8-phenyltheophylline, blockers of P1 and A1 purinoceptors, respectively, did not affect the purinergic NANC relaxations to EFS. 8. Our results suggest that ATP or a related purine acts as an inhibitory NANC neurotransmitter in the mouse jejunum, activating P2 but not P1 purinoceptors. Relaxations to the purinergic NANC neurotransmitter mainly involve P2Y receptors of the P2Y1 subtype that are located postjunctionally. Purinergic NANC neurotransmission also involves P2X receptors, most likely of the P2X1 and P2X3 subtype, located pre- and/or postjunctionally.",

To assess the possible modulatory influence of nAChRs on epileptiform activity, a range of nAChR ligands were applied during experimentally induced epileptiform activity in rat hippocampal slices. Bath application of the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4AP; 10-50 microM) resulted in the development of spontaneous epileptiform bursting activity in area CA3 that consisted of short duration (257+/-15 ms) field events occurring regularly at a frequency of 0.4+/-0.02 Hz. Subsequent co-application of the selective nAChR agonists 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium iodide (DMPP; 0.3-300 microM), choline (0.01-3mM) and lobeline (3-30 microM) produced sustained and concentration-dependent increases in burst frequency with maximal frequency potentiation of 37+/-5%, 27+/-5% and 24+/-11%, respectively. DMPP (10-30 microM; n=31) also potentiated epileptiform bursting induced by reducing GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission using 20 microM bicuculline or enhancing NMDA receptor-mediated excitation by lowering extracellular Mg(2+). Irrespective of the epileptiform model studied all nAChR agonist induced frequency potentiation was reversed upon washout of the agonist or co-application of one of the selective nAChR antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine (10-30 microM), mecamylamine (50-200 microM) or alpha-bungarotoxin (100 nM). These results provide compelling evidence that activation of nAChRs exacerbate epileptiform activity in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "188": "A retrospective audit of the first twelve months of out patient drug treatment of hypertension at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital during the period 1973-1993 is reported. A previous study had shown that at least 7 drug regimes were used to treat hypertension at Korle-Bu during the period. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect and efficacy of these antihypertensive drug treatment regimes on blood pressure during the first 12 months of treatment. Result of 155 (47%) case notes, which met the inclusion criteria, are presented. One month of drug treatment of hypertension significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 21.4 +/- 30.5 (p<0.001) and 13.8 +/- 16.5 (p<0.001) mmHg, respectively. This reduction in blood pressure was maintained to the 12th month. At 12 months, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were unchanged in 19% and 28% of patients, respectively, indicating no response to drug treatment. Recommended target blood pressure of < or = 140/90 mm Hg was achieved in only 25.6% of all patients. All drug treatment regimes significantly reduced blood pressure to a similar extent so that any differences were not statistically significant. However, the efficacy of the drug regimes differed significantly (p=0.02). It was greatest in patients treated with monotherapy with either diuretic or reserpine, intermediate with two drug combinations and least with 3 or 4 drugs. The data showed that diuretics were marginally better than reserpine as first line monotherapy. Furthermore, any diuretic based 2-drug regime was equally efficacious although a beta-blocker or methyldopa as second drug seemed favoured by the data. The addition of a third or fourth drug was counter productive as the increased number of drugs did not decrease blood pressure significantly."
