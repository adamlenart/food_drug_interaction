    "1": "We measured the prevalence of ocular beta-blocker prescribing in people with asthma and ocular hypertension, and performed a nested case-control study (NCCS) measuring risk of moderate exacerbations (rescue steroids in primary care) and severe exacerbations (asthma hospitalization) using linked data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We then performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating changes in lung function following ocular beta-blocker administration in people with asthma.", 
    "2": "From 2000 to 2012, the prevalence of non-selective and selective beta-blocker eye drop prescribing in people with asthma and ocular hypertension fell from 23.0% to 13.4% and from 10.5% to 0.9% respectively. In the NCCS, the relative incidence (IRR) of moderate exacerbations increased significantly with acute non-selective beta-blocker eye drop exposure (IRR 4.83, 95% CI 1.56-14.94) but not with chronic exposure. In the meta-analysis, acute non-selective beta-blocker eye drop exposure caused significant mean falls in FEV1 of -10.9% (95% CI -14.9 to -6.9), and falls in FEV1 of \u226520% affecting one in three. Corresponding values for selective beta-blockers in people sensitive to ocular non-selective beta-blockers was -6.3% (95% CI -11.7 to -0.8), and a non-significant increase in falls in FEV1 of \u226520%.",

    "4": "There is scarce information regarding ambulatory blood pressure (BP) achieved in daily practice with a wide range of antihypertensive drug combinations. We looked for differences in office and ambulatory BP among major drug combinations of two and three antihypertensive agents from a different drugs class. A total of 17187 patients treated with six types of two-drug combinations and 9724 treated with six types of three-drug combinations from the Spanish ABPM Registry were analyzed. We compared achieved office and ambulatory BP, as well as office (< 140/90 mmHg) and ambulatory (24-hour BP < 130/80; day BP < 135/85, and night BP < 120/70 mmHg) BP control among groups. The combination of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers with diuretics and the triple combination of RAS blockers with diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCB) were associated with lower values of 24-hour, daytime and nighttime BP, as well as more pronounced nocturnal BP dip. Compared with such combinations (reference), other double combinations had lower rates of ambulatory BP control. Moreover, triple combinations containing alpha blockers also had lower rates of ambulatory BP control. We conclude that even with similar office BP control, differences exist among antihypertensive two-drug and three-drug combinations with respect to ambulatory BP control achieved during treatment, with RAS blockers/diuretics and RAS blockers/CCBs/diuretics obtaining better control rates. This can help physicians choose among drug combinations in order to obtain further ambulatory BP reductions.", 
    "5": "Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by a dilated and poorly functioning left ventricle and can result from several different etiologies including ischemic, infectious, metabolic, toxins, autoimmune processes or nutritional deficiencies. Carnitine deficiency-induced cardiomyopathy (CDIM) is an uncommon cause of dilated cardiomyopathy that can go untreated if not considered. Here, we describe a 30-year-old woman with an eating disorder and recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy (PEG) tube placement for weight loss admitted to the hospital for possible PEG tube infection. Carnitine level was found to be low. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed ejection fraction 15%. Her hospital course was complicated by sepsis from a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). She was discharged on a beta-blocker and carnitine supplementation. One month later her cardiac function had normalized. Carnitine deficiency-induced myopathy is an unusual cause of cardiomyopathy and should be considered in adults with decreased oral intake or malabsorption who present with cardiomyopathy.",

    "9": "Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a bimatoprost insert plus artificial tears twice daily or a placebo insert plus timolol (0.5% solution) twice daily for 6 months after a screening washout period. Diurnal IOP measurements (at 0, 2, and 8 hours) were obtained at baseline; weeks 2, 6, and 12; and months 4, 5, and 6. Key eligibility included washout IOP of 23 mmHg or more at time 0, IOP of 20 mmHg or more at 2 and 8 hours, and IOP of 34 mmHg or less at all time points; no prior incisional surgery for OAG or OHT; and no known nonresponders to prostaglandins.",

Secondary end points were diurnal IOP measurements at months 4, 5, and 6 and adverse events (AEs).", 
    "11": "A mean reduction from baseline IOP of\u00a0-3.2 to\u00a0-6.4 mmHg was observed for the bimatoprost group compared with\u00a0-4.2 to\u00a0-6.4 mmHg for the timolol group over 6 months. The study met the noninferiority definition at 2 of 9 time points but was underpowered for the observed treatment effect. Adverse events were consistent with bimatoprost or timolol exposure; no unexpected ocular AEs were observed. Primary retention rate of the insert was 88.5% of patients at 6 months.", 
    "12": "Clinically relevant reduction in mean IOP was observed over 6 months with a bimatoprost ocular insert and seems to be safe and well tolerated. The topically applied bimatoprost insert may provide an alternative to daily eye drops to improve adherence, consistency of delivery, and reduction of elevated IOP.", 
    "13": "Diverse techniques have been developed to analyze antibody-mediated responses to infections. However, the most common tests, i.e., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, require separate reactions for each antigen and consequently necessitate large sample volumes. Luminex technology allows the detection of multiple antibodies in a single experiment, but nonspecific binding can impair the results. Therefore, we examined the use of Escherichia coli lysates to reduce nonspecific binding and improve the results of liquid microarrays based on Luminex technology. Anti-bacteria antibodies were detected in human serum samples, as evidenced by high median fluorescence intensity (MFI) in assays performed with paramagnetic microspheres coupled with E. coli lysates. Moreover, the addition of an E. coli lysate as a blocker reduced the nonspecific binding of antigens produced by E. coli in a concentration-dependent manner. Tris-HCl reduced MFI values in negative samples, but did not affect MFI for positive samples. For microspheres coupled with different antigens, an E. coli lysate blocker significantly improved the fluorescence signals from positive samples. The addition of Tris-HCl and the E. coli lysate induced antigen-specific differences in MFI. This combination of the E. coli lysate blocker and Tris-HCl yielded a statistically significant improvement in MFI in the assays for Chagas disease and hepatitis C virus samples. However, for the Treponema pallidum p47 antigen improvement in MFI was only observed for the preparation with the E. coli blocker at a concentration of 3%. In conclusion, the addition of an E. coli lysate and Tris-HCl to the microarray assay reduced the nonspecific binding of human anti-bacteria antibodies and, therefore, increased the specific MFI.", 
    "14": "Adsorption of weakly basic compounds by sludge is poorly understood, although it has important implications on the distribution and fate of such micropollutants in wastewater effluent and sludge. Additionally, many of these compounds are chiral, and it is likely that their interactions with sludge is stereoselective and that the process may be further modified by surfactants that coexist in these systems. Adsorption of (R) and (S)-enantiomers of five commonly used \u03b2-blockers, i.e., acebutolol, atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol, on sludge was characterized through batch experiments. Stereoselectivity in adsorption increased with decreases in hydrophobicity of the \u03b2-blockers. The enantiomeric fraction (EF) of the amount of acebutolol, atenolol and metoprolol sorbed on sludge were 0.27, 0.55 and 0.32, respectively. Thus, Kd values of the (S)-enantiomers of acebutolol and metoprolol were approximately twice that of the (R)-enantiomer, that is, 109\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 and 57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0L/kg compared to 52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 and 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0L/kg, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in Kd values of the enantiomers of pindolol and propranolol, suggesting stereoselectivity in adsorption was likely driven by specific polar interactions rather than hydrophobic interactions. The EF value of atenolol decreased from 0.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 to 0.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04 after modifying the sludge with Triton X 100. These results suggested that surfactants altered adsorption of \u03b2-blockers to sludge, likely by forming ion pair complexes that promote hydrophobic interactions with the solid surfaces.",

    "19": "Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort of 216 participants recently hospitalized with systolic HF, attending 5 HF-DMPs in Queensland, Australia. Medication history at baseline (6weeks after discharge) and 6months provided data to describe prescription rates, dosage and optimal titration of HF medications, and associations with patient and system factors were explored. At baseline, 94% were on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB), 94% on a beta-blocker (BB) and 42% on a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). The proportion of participants on optimal doses of ACEI/ARB increased from 38% (baseline) to 52% (6months, p=0.001) and on optimal BB dose from 23% to 49% (p<0.001). Significant barriers to ACEI/ARB up-titration were body mass index (BMI)<25, female gender, polypharmacy, previously diagnosed HF, and tertiary hospital. Significant barriers for BB up-titration were BMI<25, previously diagnosed HF and non-cardiologist care.",

    "21": "Acute administration of olanzapine rapidly elevates blood glucose levels. However, the mechanism underlying the rapid development of hyperglycemia with the administration of olanzapine remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanism underlying olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of saline (control) or olanzapine 2.5, 5, or 10\u2009mg/kg. Blood samples were obtained periodically after olanzapine infusion to determine serum concentrations of glucose, olanzapine, and several endogenous substances. In a separate experiment, rats received an intravenous injection of propranolol (2\u2009mg/kg) 30\u2009min before infusion of olanzapine (10\u2009mg/kg). The intravenous infusion of olanzapine induced dose-dependent increases in the serum concentrations of glucose, epinephrine, and insulin. Pretreatment with propranolol suppressed olanzapine-induced elevations in the serum concentration of glucose, but did not affect the serum concentration of olanzapine or olanzapine-induced increase in the serum concentration of epinephrine. Although the serum concentration of corticosterone increased after administration of olanzapine, no significant differences were observed among the olanzapine dose groups. Furthermore, administration of olanzapine did not affect the serum concentration of glucagon or histamine. We developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model assuming that the olanzapine-induced secretion of epinephrine leads to elevated serum glucose concentrations. This model appeared to satisfactorily characterize olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia. In conclusion, a single intravenous dose of olanzapine dose-dependently increased the serum concentration of glucose in rats, and epinephrine plays a role in olanzapine-induced acute hyperglycemia.", 
    "22": "For many patients any type of surgical invention can increase their stress response which can make the body vulnerable to untoward outcomes. An extreme consequence of the stress response is death with other responses including heart attacks and stroke, to impacting on the patients' postoperative reviver such as their psychological status and pain recovery. Therefore there is a need to consider the attenuation of the perioperative stress response through the use of drugs such as beta-blockers. These drugs have been shown to reduce the heart rate and lower the patients' blood pressure. Although this is a desired result in trying to eliminate the effects of the stress response it can also have the opposite effect on reducing the patients' blood pressure and pulse to a point where the patients suffers ill effects such as stroke or death. Therefore it is vital to understand the influence of beta-blockers and their ability to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "23": "The aim was to investigate the effect of the long-acting \u03b22-adrenergic agonist formoterol on muscle strength and power output, muscle metabolism, and phosphorylation of CaMKII Thr(287) and FXYD1 during maximal sprinting. In a double-blind crossover study, 13 males [V\u0307o2 max: 45.0 \u00b1 0.2 (means \u00b1 SE) ml\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7kg(-1)] performed a 30-s cycle ergometer sprint after inhalation of either 54 \u03bcg of formoterol (FOR) or placebo (PLA). Before and after the sprint, muscle biopsies were collected from vastus lateralis and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), and contractile properties of quadriceps were measured. Oxygen uptake was measured during the sprint. During the sprint, peak power, mean power, and end power were 4.6 \u00b1 0.8, 3.9 \u00b1 1.1, and 9.5 \u00b1 3.2% higher (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA, respectively. Net rates of glycogenolysis and glycolysis were 45.7 \u00b1 21.0 and 28.5 \u00b1 13.4% higher (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA, respectively, and the decrease in ATP content was lower (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA (3.7 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 8.0 \u00b1 1.6 mmol/kg dry weight). There was no difference in breakdown of phosphocreatine and oxygen uptake between treatments. Before and after the sprint, MVC and peak twitch force were higher (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA. No differences were observed in phosphorylation of CaMKII Thr(287) and FXYD1 between treatments before the sprint, whereas phosphorylation of CaMKII Thr(287) and FXYD1 was greater (P < 0.05) in FOR than in PLA after the sprint. In conclusion, formoterol-induced enhancement in power output during maximal sprinting is associated with increased rates of glycogenolysis and glycolysis that may counteract development of fatigue.",

However, the tolerance to betablockers in patients hospitalized with acute heart failure should be evaluated. Objective To estimate the proportion of patients hospitalized with acute heart failure who can tolerate these agents in clinical practice and compare the clinical outcomes of patients who can and cannot tolerate treatment with beta-blockers. Setting Two reference hospitals in cardiology. Methods Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized for acute heart failure between September 2008 and May 2012. Population-based sample. During the study period, 325 patients were admitted consecutively, including 194 individuals with an acute heart failure diagnosis and systolic left ventricular dysfunction and ejection fraction \u226445\u00a0%, who were candidates for the initiation or continuation of beta-blockers. Main outcome measure The percentage of patients intolerant to beta-blockers and the clinical characteristics of patients. Results On admission, 61.8\u00a0% of patients were already using beta-blockers, and 73.2\u00a0% were using beta-blockers on discharge. During hospitalization, 85\u00a0% of patients used these agents for some period. The main reasons for not using betablockers were low cardiac output syndrome (24.4\u00a0%), bradycardia (24.4\u00a0%), severe hypotension or shock (17.8\u00a0%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13.3\u00a0%). Patients who were intolerant or did not use a beta-blocker had a longer hospital stay (18.3 vs. 11.0\u00a0days; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), greater use of vasoactive drugs (41.5 vs. 16.3\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001, CI 1.80-7.35), sepsis and septic shock (RR\u00a0=\u00a03.02; CI 95\u00a0% 1.59-5.75), and higher mortality rate during hospitalization (22.6 vs. 2.9\u00a0%; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; CI 3.05-32.26).

A total of 378 patients were enrolled, with 145 treated with aspirin and clopidogrel (AC) and 233 with aspirin and ticagrelor (AT). The AC patients were older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and more often showed elective PCI as an indication to DAPT (<0.001); they received chronic therapy with ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), nitrates (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044), CCB (calcium channel blocker; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and diuretics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044).

No difference was found in the baseline uric acid and creatinine levels between AC and AT patients. At 30-90 days, a significant absolute and percentage increase in the SUA levels was found in AT as compared to AC patients (0.204\u00a0mg/dl vs. -0.165\u00a0mg/dl, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034; 6.26% vs. -0.005%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018, respectively). Results were not influenced by variations in renal function. At multivariate analysis, in fact, ticagrelor therapy emerged as an independent predictor of increase in the uric acid levels (odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval (CI))\u00a0=\u00a02.79 (1.66-4.67), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

However, only two studies have examined the content of noradrenaline or its metabolites in the amygdala of rats previously exposed to traumatic stress showing inconsistent results. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an inescapable foot shock (IFS) procedure (1) on reactivity to novelty in an open-field (as an index of hyperarousal), and (2) on noradrenaline release in the amygdala during an acute stress. To test the role of noradrenaline in amygdala, we also investigated the effects of microinjections of propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, and clenbuterol, a \u03b2-adrenoreceptor agonist, into the amygdala of IFS and control animals. Finally, we evaluated the expression of mRNA levels of \u03b2-adrenoreceptors (\u03b21 and \u03b22) in the amygdala, the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Male Wistar rats (3 months) were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae. After recovering from surgery, animals were exposed to IFS (10 shocks, 0.86mA, and 6s per shock) and seven days later either microdialysis or microinjections were performed in amygdala. Animals exposed to IFS showed a reduced locomotion compared to non-shocked animals during the first 5min in the open-field. In the amygdala, IFS animals showed an enhanced increase of noradrenaline induced by stress compared to control animals. Bilateral microinjections of propranolol (0.5\u03bcg) into the amygdala one hour before testing in the open-field normalized the decreased locomotion observed in IFS animals. On the other hand, bilateral microinjections of clenbuterol (30ng) into the amygdala of control animals did not change the exploratory activity induced by novelty in the open field. IFS modified the mRNA expression of \u03b21 and \u03b22 adrenoreceptors in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.

    "54": "The impairment of vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) production is well accepted as a typical marker of endothelial dysfunction in vascular diseases, including in the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but the molecular mechanisms accounting for loss of NO production are unknown. We hypothesized that low NO production by pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in PAH is due to inactivation of NO synthase (eNOS) by aberrant phosphorylation of the protein. To test the hypothesis, we evaluated eNOS levels, dimerization, and phosphorylation in the vascular endothelial cells and lungs of patients with PAH compared with controls. In mechanistic studies, eNOS activity in endothelial cells in PAH lungs was found to be inhibited due to phosphorylation at T495. Evidence pointed to greater phosphorylation/activation of protein kinase C (PKC) \u03b1 and its greater association with eNOS as the source of greater phosphorylation at T495. The presence of greater amounts of pT495-eNOS in plexiform lesions in lungs of patients with PAH confirmed the pathobiological mechanism in vivo. Transfection of the activating mutation of eNOS (T495A/S1177D) restored NO production in PAH cells. Pharmacological blockade of PKC activity by \u03b2-blocker also restored NO formation by PAH cells, identifying one mechanism by which \u03b2-blockers may benefit PAH and cardiovascular diseases through recovery of endothelial functions.",

    "56": "INTRODUCTION Adipose tissue has been recently recognized as an endocrine organ secreting a number of adipokines contributing to the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and vascular remodeling. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with a \u03b2-blocker, calcium antagonist, thiazide-like diuretic, or angiotensin II receptor type 1 influences plasma concentrations of apelin, resistin, and visfatin in obese hypertensive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study included 84 obese patients with essential hypertension. One control group included obese subjects without hypertension, and the other, lean subjects without hypertension. Patients with hypertension were randomized into 4 groups treated for 6 weeks with bisoprolol, amlodipine, indapamide, or candesartan, respectively. RESULTS Mean daily plasma apelin concentrations in patients treated with amlodipine was significantly higher than the baseline values, whereas the difference in plasma apelin concentrations in other treatment groups was not significant. Mean daily plasma resistin concentrations were significantly lower after 6-week treatment with amlodipine, bisoprolol, or indapamide compared with the baseline values. In patients treated with candesartan, no significant differences in resistin concentrations were shown. After 6-week treatment with bisoprolol, mean daily plasma concentrations of visfatin were significantly lower compared with the baseline values. Treatment with amlodipine, candesartan, or indapamide did not significantly affect plasma visfatin levels. CONCLUSIONS Antihypertensive treatment exerts significant and varied effects on adipokine secretion in obese hypertensive patients. Changes in apelin secretion, caused by the use of different antihypertensive drugs, may protect the cardiovascular system and kidneys. The involvement of adipokins in the mechanism of diverse protective effects of antihypertensive drugs, independently of the effect on blood pressure, requires further research.",

For individuals with secondary hypertension arising from primary hyperaldosteronism, adrenal vein sampling is recommended for those who are candidates for potential adrenalectomy. With respect to the treatment of hypertension, a new recommendation that has been added is for increasing dietary potassium to reduce blood pressure in those who are not at high risk for hyperkalemia. Furthermore, in selected high-risk patients, intensive blood pressure reduction to a target systolic blood pressure \u2264\u00a0120 mm Hg should be considered to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Finally, in hypertensive individuals with uncomplicated, stable angina pectoris, either a \u03b2-blocker or calcium channel blocker may be considered for initial therapy. The specific evidence and rationale underlying each of these recommendations are discussed. Hypertension Canada's Canadian Hypertension Education Program Guidelines Task Force will continue to provide annual updates.",

    "91": "Reactive oxygen species play an important role in both acute and chronic kidney diseases. Chronic kidney disease is associated with various consequences to the cardiovascular system and metabolic profiles. Nebivolol, a highly cardioselective third-generation \u03b2-blocker, has nitric oxide (NO) induced vasodilation and antioxidant properties. Nebivolol affects the endothelial NO pathway in two complementary ways: it increases endothelial mediated NO expression and has antioxidant action, which leads to a decrease in degradation. Central blood pressure can be effectively lowered by nebivolol in the prehypertension phase. Clinically nebivolol's ability to modulate endothelial dysfunction may offer additional vascular protection in treating hypertension. As well, pre-treatment with 5mg nebivolol every 24\u00a0hours for 4 days is protective against nephrotoxic effects of contrast media. The aim of this study is to review the current literature on the efficacy and safety of nebivolol in the treatment of various states of renal diseases.",

LV stiffness is a main component of diastolic function, but its role and prognostic value in HFrEF patients remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether diastolic wall strain (DWS) as a noninvasive and simple marker of LV stiffness can predict the prognosis of HFrEF patients who were administrated chronic beta blockade enough. We enrolled 75 HFrEF patients who were administrated chronic beta blockade. We evaluated the echocardiographic parameters and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) before the induction of beta blockade and also obtained pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) from the right heart catheterization. DWS was obtained from standard M-mode echocardiography as follows: DWS\u00a0=\u00a0[(LV posterior wall thickness (LVPWT) at end-systole\u00a0-\u00a0LVPWT at end-diastole)/LVPWT] at end-systole. DWS did not correlate with other echocardiographic parameters and PAWP. We defined primary outcome as HF hospitalization\u00a0or cardiovascular death and followed for 7\u00a0years. The incidence rate was higher in low DWS than high DWS patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Other echocardiographic parameters could not be significant predictors of HFrEF outcome under the condition of enough beta blocker therapy. In multivariate analysis, DWS was the independent contributor to the event-free time. Impaired LV stiffness evaluated with DWS was associated with worse outcome and DWS might be an independent prognostic factor in HFrEF patients with chronic beta blockade.",

We tested the hypothesis that chronic nebivolol treatment reduces ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone in adult humans with elevated blood pressure (BP). Furthermore, reducing ET-1 vasoconstrictor activity contributes to the improvement in endothelial vasodilator function associated with nebivolol treatment. Forty-two middle-aged adults with elevated BP (systolic BP \u2265130 mm Hg or diastolic BP \u226585 mm Hg) completed a 3-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial: 14 received nebivolol (8 men/6 women; 5 mg per day); 14 received metoprolol succinate (9 men/5 women; 100 mg per day); and 14 received placebo (9 men/5 women). Forearm blood flow (plethysmography) responses to selective (BQ-123: 100 nmol/min; 60 minutes) and nonselective (BQ-123+BQ-788 [50 nmol/min]; 60 minutes) ET-1 receptor blockade, as well as acetylcholine (4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 \u03bcg per 100 mL of tissue per minute) in the absence and presence of nonselective ET-1 receptor blockade were determined before and after each treatment intervention. Forearm blood flow responses to BQ-123 and BQ-123+BQ-788 were similarly and significantly elevated (\u224830% and 60%, respectively) from baseline in all 3 groups. Nebivolol, but not metoprolol or placebo, therapy resulted in a marked (\u224825% and 45%; P<0.05) reduction in forearm blood flow response to BQ-123 and BQ-123+BQ-788. Moreover, after nebivolol therapy only, vasodilator response to acetylcholine was not significantly increased by ET-1 receptor blockade. These results demonstrate that nebivolol, but not metoprolol, treatment reduces ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone in adult humans with elevated BP. In addition, nebivolol-induced reduction in ET-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone underlies the favorable effects of this \u03b2-blocker on endothelial vasodilation.",

We herein present a case of unresectable giant hepatic hemangioma with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The patient was a 60-year-old woman who complained of hematochezia, ecchymosis, and abdominal distension. She refused all surgical management and was therefore treated with systemic glucocorticoids and beta-blockers. After two weeks of steroid therapy, she responded partially to the treatment. Her laboratory findings and hematochezia improved. She was discharged on hospital day 33 and observed without signs of bleeding for three months.",

Improvement in LV function and size may result from either change in loading conditions or reversal of remodeling (RR). When complete normalization of LV function and geometry occurs (ejection fraction >50% and indexed LV end-diastolic dimension <33\u2009mm/m(2)), true reversal of LV alteration is likely to have occurred. Sustained improvement in function and dimensions after therapy withdrawal further supports RR. In the absence of complete RR one cannot readily differentiate incomplete RR from changes in loading conditions.

The present study was designed to evaluate the role that central gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA-B) receptor plays in neutrophil migration in a murine model of zymosan-induced arthritis by using different pharmacological tools. We observed that intrathecal administration of baclofen, a selective GABA-B agonist, exacerbated the inflammatory response in the knee after zymosan administration characterized by an increase in the neutrophil recruitment and knee joint edema, whereas saclofen, a GABA-B antagonist, exerted the opposite effect. Intrathecal pretreatment of the animals with SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) blocked the pro-inflammatory effect of baclofen. On the other hand, systemic administration of guanethidine, a sympatholytic drug that inhibits catecholamine release, and nadolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reversed the effect of saclofen. Moreover, saclofen suppressed the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines into the knee joint (ELISA) and pain-related behaviors (open field test). Since the anti-inflammatory effect of saclofen depends on the sympathetic nervous system integrity, we observed that isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, mimics the central GABA-B blockade decreasing knee joint neutrophil recruitment. Together, these results demonstrate that the pharmacological manipulation of spinal GABAergic transmission aids control of neutrophil migration to the inflamed joint by modulating the activation of the knee joint-innervating sympathetic terminal fibers through a mechanism dependent on peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors and central components, such as p38 MAPK.",

    "117": "Heart rate plays a major role in myocardial ischemia. A high heart rate increases myocardial performance and oxygen demand and reduces diastolic time. Ivabradine reduces heart rate by inhibiting the If current of sinoatrial-node cells. In contrast to beta-blockers, ivabradine has no negative inotropic and lusitropic effect for a comparable heart rate reduction. Consequently, diastolic duration is increased with ivabradine compared to beta-blockers. This has potential consequences on coronary blood flow since compression of the vasculature by the surrounding myocardium during systole impedes flow and coronary blood flow is mainly diastolic. Moreover, ivabradine does not unmask alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction and, unlike beta-blockers, maintains coronary dilation during exercise. In comparison with beta-blockers, ivabradine increases coronary flow reserve and collateral perfusion promoting the development of coronary collaterals. Ivabradine attenuates myocardial ischemia and its consequences even in the absence of heart rate reduction, possibly through reduced formation of reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, ivabradine differs from other anti-anginal agents by improving coronary blood flow and by additional pleiotropic effects. These properties make ivabradine an effective anti-anginal and anti-ischemic agent for the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.",

Interestingly, BmKTX-D33H, with its conserved anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet domain as a Kv1.3 channel-interacting interface, exhibited more than 1000-fold selectivity towards the Kv1.3 channel as compared to other K\u207a channels (including Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.7, Kv11.1, KCa2.2, KCa2.3, and KCa3.1). As expected, BmKTX-D33H was found to inhibit the cytokine production and proliferation of both Jurkat cells and human T cells in vitro. It also significantly improved the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses, an autoreactive T cell-mediated inflammation in rats. Amino acid sequence alignment and structural analysis strongly suggest that the \"evolutionary\" Gly11 residue of BmKTX-D33H interacts with the turret domain of Kv1 channels; it appears to be a pivotal amino acid residue with regard to the selectivity of BmKTX-D33H towards the Kv1.3 channel (in comparison with the highly homologous scorpion toxins).

These bioactive substances are responsible for the carcinoid syndrome characterized by diarrhea, flushing, syncope, and right-sided valvular heart disease. Previous case reports have described carcinoid syndrome associated with coronary vasospasm and the well-characterized carcinoid heart disease. Case. Our patient is a 73-year-old female with complex past medical history most notable for metastatic carcinoid tumors diagnosed in 2013-05. She initially presented in 2014-09 with syncope and dizziness associated with sinus pause on an event monitor. She received a pacemaker given normal left ventricular function and was discharged. However, she was readmitted with similar symptoms corresponding to multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia. She was started on high-dose beta blockade and has had no recurrence of arrhythmia over a follow-up period of 12 months. Conclusion. We hypothesize that the patient's ventricular tachycardia was mediated by the multiple bioactive substances secreted by her carcinoid tumors. Her carcinoid tumor biomarkers were elevated and other explanations for arrhythmia were investigated and ruled out. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ventricular tachycardia mediated by carcinoid syndrome and suppressed by beta-blocker. Further investigation into this relationship is needed.",

The heart is endowed with powerful self-protective ability executed by endogenous \u03b22-adrenopeptide receptor activation. I/R triggers cardiac epinephrine and neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release. Cardiac \u03b21- and \u03b22-AR stimulation mediates pro- and anti-apoptotic cell signaling, respectively. Removal of myocardial \u03b21-AR-derived proapoptotic force with \u03b21-AR blockade unmasks the dominance of \u03b22-AR mediated prosurvival cell signaling through the well-defined PKA-Akt dependent mechanism. This review focuses on recent clinical and experimental findings including intrinsic cardiac \u03b22-adrenopeptide neuroparacrine signaling mechanisms involved in I/R injury protection. While \u03b22-adrenopeptide-mediated cardioprotection is important, age-related \u03b22-adrenopeptide receptor decoupling can result in their ineffectiveness in response to the receptor-specific therapies. Accordingly, direct activation of receptor-coupled upstream PKA-dependent signaling may serve as a therapeutic alternative to achieve cardioprotection bypassing adrenopeptidergic receptor decoupling accompanied with aging. Phosphodiesterase-3 (PDE3) inhibitor reduces infarct-size via cAMP-dependent PKA signaling. Non-\u03b21-AR-mediated PKA activation activates multiple prosurvival signaling pathways eventually leading to Akt activation. Combination therapy with \u03b21-blocker esmolol and PDE3 inhibitor milrinone additively reduced infarct-size in preclinical studies.

    "189": "Vasospastic angina is a diagnosis of exclusion that manifests with signs and symptoms, which overlap with obstructive coronary artery disease, most often ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The pharmacotherapy that is available to treat vasospastic angina can help ameliorate angina symptoms. However, the etiology of vasospastic angina is ill-defined, making targeted pharmacotherapy difficult. Most patients receive pharmacotherapy that includes calcium channel blockers and/or long-acting nitrates. This article reviews the efficacy and safety of the pharmacotherapy used to treat vasospastic angina. High-dose calcium channel blockers possess the most evidence, with respect to decreasing angina incidence, frequency, and duration. However, not all patients respond to calcium channel blockers. Nitrates and/or alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonists can be used in patients who respond poorly to calcium channel blockers. Albeit, evidence for use of nitrates and alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonists in vasospastic angina is not as robust as calcium channel blockers and can exacerbate adverse effects when added to calcium channel blocker therapy. Despite having a clear benefit in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, the benefit of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, statins, and aspirin remains unclear. More data are needed to elucidate whether or not these agents are beneficial or harmful to patients being treated for vasospastic angina. Overall, the use of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of vasospastic angina should be guided by patient-specific factors, such as tolerability, adverse effects, drug-drug, and drug-disease interactions.", 
    "190": "We started with a medium throughput screen of heterocyclic compounds without basic amine groups to avoid hERG and \u03b2-blocker activity and identified [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine as an early lead. Optimization of substituents for Late INa current inhibition and lack of Peak INa inhibition led to the discovery of 4h (GS-458967) with improved anti-arrhythmic activity relative to ranolazine. Unfortunately, 4h demonstrated use dependent block across the sodium isoforms including the central and peripheral nervous system isoforms that is consistent with its low therapeutic index (approximately 5-fold in rat, 3-fold in dog). Compound 4h represents our initial foray into a 2nd generation Late INa inhibitor program and is an important proof-of-concept compound. We will provide additional reports on addressing the CNS challenge in a follow-up communication.", 
    "191": "This retrospective, consecutive, clinical case series examined the use of topical timolol in the treatment of 5 children with deep, periocular infantile hemangiomas that caused astigmatism, change in head posture, or ptosis. All patients were treated with timolol maleate solution 0.5% twice daily until the lesions had regressed. All 5 children showed regression of the lesion and improvement in amblyogenic risk factors within 2\u00a0weeks.",

Current safety guidelines focus on the effects of blocking the KCNH2/HERG ion channel-in tissues and animals with intact repolarization. Novel models with better predictive value are needed that more closely reflect the conditions in patients with cardiac remodelling and reduced repolarization reserve.", 
    "193": "We have developed a model for the long QT syndrome type-5 in rabbits (LQT5 ) with cardiac-specific overexpression of a mutant (G52R) KCNE1 \u03b2-subunit of the channel that carries the slow delayed-rectifier K(+) -current (IKs ). ECG parameters, including short-term variability of the QT interval (STVQT ), a biomarker for proarrhythmic risk, and arrhythmia development were recorded. In vivo, arrhythmia susceptibility was evaluated by i.v. administration of the IKr blocker dofetilide. K(+) currents were measured with the patch-clamp technique.", 
    "194": "Patch-clamp studies in ventricular myocytes isolated from LQT5 rabbits revealed accelerated IKs and IKr deactivation kinetics. At baseline, LQT5 animals exhibited slightly but significantly prolonged heart-rate corrected QT index (QTi) and increased STVQT . Dofetilide provoked Torsade-de-Pointes arrhythmia in a greater proportion of LQT5 rabbits, paralleled by a further increase in STVQT .",

Impairment of vision, although rare, is a devastating complication of this procedure, which may not be reversible. We report on a patient who experienced visual acuity impairment and ischemic oculomotor nerve palsy after injection of HA into the nasal dorsum. In this case, clinical signs improved within 14 days of treatment. We also provide a review of the mechanism, clinical features, risk factors, and prevention and treatment strategies relating to embolization of ocular circulation after injection of HA. Vision loss is a rare but devastating complication of injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the face. Visual acuity seldom recovers completely. We report on a 22-year-old Asian woman who experienced obstruction of a branch of the retinal artery after injection of HA to augment her nose. The patient's visual acuity declined shortly after the procedure, and ophthalmoplegia occurred. Combination treatment was administered to restore the perfusion and oxygen supply to the retina and optic nerve. Within 14 days of rigorous treatment, the patient experienced improvement in visual acuity, extraocular movement, and visual field defects. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE 5: Risk.", 
    "201": "The synchronous sustained-release of two drugs was desired urgently for patients needing combination therapy in long term. However, sophisticated technologies were used generally to realize the simultaneous delivery of two drugs especially those with different physico-chemical properties. The purpose of this study was to obtain the concurrent release of felodipine and metoprolol tartrate, two drugs with completely different solubilities, in a simple monolithic osmotic pump system (FMOP). Two types of blocking agents were used in monolithic osmotic pump tablets and the synchronous sustained-release of FMOP was acquired in vitro. The tablets were also administered to beagle dogs and the plasma levels of FMOP were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental model. Cmax of both felodipine and metoprolol from the osmotic pump tablets were lower, tmax and mean residence time of both felodipine and metoprolol from the osmotic pump tablets were longer significantly than those from immediate release tablets. These results verified prolonged release of felodipine and metoprolol tartrate from osmotic pump formulations. The similar absorption rate between felodipine and metoprolol in beagles was also obtained by this osmotic pump formulation. Therefore, it could be supposed that the accordant release of two drugs with completely different solubilities may be realized just by using monolithic osmotic pump technology.",

Treatment had an average duration of 10.5\u00a0months. Ninety-six percent responded to the treatment, showing decreases in size and coloration of the hemangioma. Children who started therapy before 5\u00a0months of age had a significantly better response and shorter duration of treatment. The average therapeutic dose was 1.5\u00a0mg/kg/day. Five patients experienced mild adverse effects during the first month of therapy.",

    "207": "Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are common vascular tumors that typically follow a predictable pattern of rapid proliferation followed by gradual involution. Although most do not require treatment, some large or difficult IHs do, with medical and surgical options available. Prior reports indicate the success of using propranolol, a nonselective \u03b2-blocker, to treat these lesions. This report will demonstrate the use of propranolol preoperatively to manage a large IH followed by surgical excision of the lesion in a collaborative medical and surgical approach.",

The dog was diagnosed with bilateral immune-mediated keratoconjunctivitis sicca, treated with topical cyclosporine 0\u00b72% ointment and sodium hyaluronate eye drops and improved considerably. After 2 months, pulmonic stenosis was diagnosed, and the dog commenced treatment with oral atenolol; the ophthalmological disease worsened dramatically within a few days. The ophthalmic signs rapidly improved after discontinuation of atenolol, and there was bilateral complete remission after 3 weeks. No oral \u03b2-blocker therapy was reintroduced, and thereafter, keratoconjunctivitis sicca was well-controlled with topical therapy.",

Fifty-one water samples were collected from 17 pools located in sport centres and hotels in Catalonia, Spain. The samples were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The pharmaceuticals atenolol, carbamazepine, hydrochlorothiazide, metronidazole, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen and phenazone were measured in water samples at concentrations higher than their limit of quantification (LOQ). The highest concentration of any individual pharmaceutical was measured for the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (904\u00a0ng/L). The most frequently detected pharmaceutical was carbamazepine, as it was observed in more than half of all the water samples measured (53\u00a0%, 27/51). The UV filters at concentrations higher than LOQ in water samples were BP1, BP2, BP3, BP8, THB, 4DHB, 4MBC, OD-PABA, 1HBT, MeBT and DMeBT. The highest concentration of UV filter observed was 4MBC (69.3\u00a0ng/L) while the most frequent UV filters in the samples were 1HBT (59\u00a0%, 30/51). The results also showed that pharmaceuticals and UV filters were most frequently found in spas. Finally, from a water treatment technology perspective, the lowest occurrence of pharmaceuticals was in the pools applying sand filters followed by disinfection by sodium hypochlorite, while the lowest occurrence of UV filters was in the pools applying coagulation, sand filtration, UV and salt electrolysis.",
