Rats exposed to light at night or kept in darkness during the daytime do not show any elevation of enzyme activity. Treatment with reserpine, a compound that depletes norepinephrine from nerves, 1-propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, or cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, abolishes the nocturnal increase in serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity, indicating that the enzyme activity is modulated by neural release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerves via beta-adrenergic receptors, and that the increase in enzyme activity is due to synthesis of new enzyme molecules. When rats are exposed to light at night or injected with 1-propranolol, there is a precipitous fall in serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity (half-life 5 min). Cycloheximide administered at night results in a slow fall in enzyme activity (half-life 60 min). When rats are kept in darkness and then exposed to light for 10 min, L-isoproterenol rapidly initiates the elevation of serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity to the initial level in 60 min. On the other hand, when the rats are kept in continuous light, L-isoproterenol initiates an increase in serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity after a lag phase of 60 min. The results indicate that there are two types of changes in serotonin N-acetyltransferase activity; a rapid increase and decrease mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor, and a slow increase and decrease in enzyme activity that appears to represent the turnover of the enzyme.", 
    "1": "1. A method for the measurement of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction in the rat is described.2. Dexamethasone inhibited this response in a dose-related manner.3. Disodium cromoglycate antagonized the response. A bell-shaped dose-response curve was obtained with peak activity at 1 mg/kg i.v.4. Meclofenamate was not active when given alone or in combination with dexamethasone.5. Methysergide significantly inhibited the response. Mepyramine, atropine, propranolol and adrenalectomy did not significantly modify the response.6. The relationships of anaphylactic bronchoconstriction in the rat to anaphylactic bronchoconstriction in the guinea-pig and to human asthma are discussed.", 
    "2": "1. Experiments have been made to identify the kinds of receptors concerned in the actions of catecholamines in increasing potassium efflux, membrane potential and glucose release in tissue slices prepared from guinea-pig liver.2. Glucose release could be accelerated by activation of either of two distinct receptors, one of which resembles the alpha receptor of Ahlquist's classification, the other being beta-like. Thus both amidephrine and isoprenaline (sympathomimetic amines which selectively activate alpha and beta receptors respectively) elicited the response.3. The effect of isoprenaline on glucose release was inhibited by the beta blocking agent propranolol (1 muM) but not by the alpha blocker phentolamine (10 muM), whereas the converse held for amidephrine. However, the degree of antagonism observed with phentolamine was less than found in smooth muscle, suggesting that the alpha-like receptor in the liver may differ somewhat from that in other tissues, or be less accessible to the antagonist.4. Amidephrine, like noradrenaline, increased the efflux of (42)K from the slices and caused hyperpolarization, suggesting that the increase in potassium permeability underlying these responses is alpha-mediated. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the effect of amidephrine on membrane potential was inhibited by phentolamine but not propranolol (1 muM).5. In keeping with this interpretation, low concentrations (20-50 nM) of isoprenaline, although sufficient to activate the beta receptors (as judged by the effect on glucose release) had little effect on the ionic composition of the tissue, and caused only a small increase in (42)K efflux. Thus the ;ion movement' and ;glucose' responses could be largely dissociated.6. Larger concentrations (1-6 muM) of isoprenaline increased (42)K efflux to a greater extent, although the effect was always less than with the same concentration of noradrenaline.7. Activation of the beta-receptors caused a small and inconsistent hyperpolarization which became more pronounced and also more reproducible on replacing the chloride content of the bathing fluid by the larger anion isethionate.8. Although these results show that activation of either of two distinct adrenergic receptors in guinea-pig liver can cause the same end-response (e.g. an increase in glucose release, or, under some circumstances, hyperpolarization of the cell membrane), the underlying mechanisms cannot be assumed to be identical. This is discussed.", 
    "3": "Long-term clinical studies have associated tolbutamide therapy with an increased incidence of cardiovascular deaths. The effects of this and other sulfonylurea drugs on contractility and rate of isolated rabbit atria, automaticity of isolated dog Purkinje fibers, and adenyl cyclase activity in particulate preparations of rabbit and human hearts were studied. At concentrations that are attained clinically, tolbutamide (10 mg/100 ml) increased contractility of driven rabbit atria to 124+/-5% of control, acetohexamide (3.9 mg/100 ml) to 140+/-5%, chlorpropamide (8.3 mg/100 ml) to 139+/-6%, and tolazamide (3.1 mg/100 ml) to 119+/-6%. These effects were accentuated in the presence of 2.5 x 10(-4) M theophylline and were not blocked by 1 x 10(-5) M propranolol. Adenyl cyclase was activated by each of these drugs at concentrations below those which increase contractility. The drugs also increased the rate and slope of phase 4 depolarization in spontaneously beating Purkinje fibers, but did not alter the spontaneous rate of isolated rabbit atria. Since inotropic and chronotropic stimulation can be deleterious in some clinical settings, these findings may be of significance in interpretation of cardiovascular mortality data.", 
    "4": "1. The antagonism of the contractile effects of prostaglandins F(2alpha) and E(2) by polyphloretin phosphate (PPP) was studied on the rat isolated colon.2. PPP (20 mug/ml) was found to reduce the myotropic action of angiotensin I (10 ng/ml) and II (0.3 ng/ml) whereas larger doses of both agents were not influenced.3. It is concluded that when a mixture of antagonists is used, including PPP, the rat isolated colon can be used to assay angiotensin with accuracy and specificity. The addition of 8-L-ala-AT(II) affords a further test of specificity.", 
    "5": "The immunologic release of histamine and slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from human lung tissue can be enhanced by stimulation with either alpha adrenergic agents (phenylephrine or norepinephrine in the presence of propranolol) or cholinergic agents (acetylcholine or Carbachol). The finding that atropine prevents cholinergic but not comparable alpha adrenergic enhancement is consistent with the view that cholinergic and alpha adrenergic agonists interact with separate receptor sites on the target cells involved in the immunologic release of chemical mediators. The consistent qualitative relationship between the antigen-induced release of mediators and the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) as measured by the isolation of (14)C-labeled cyclic AMP after incorporation of adenine-(14)C into the tissues or by the cyclic AMP binding protein assay suggests that changes in the level of this cyclic nucleotide mediate adrenergic modulation of the release of histamine and SRS-A. The addition of 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) produces an enhancement of the immunologic release of mediators while dibutyryl cyclic AMP is inhibitory. As cholinergic-induced enhancement was not associated with a measurable change in the levels of cyclic AMP, the possibility is suggested that cyclic GMP may be the intracellular mediator of cholinergic-induced enhancement of the immunologic release of histamine and SRS-A.", 
    "6": "1. The reversal by propranolol of its own adrenergic neurone blocking effect in the cat can be prevented by cutting the splanchnic nerves or by ligating the adrenal veins.2. In the absence of secretion from the adrenal medulla the nerve blocking action of propranolol is more complete, but can still be reversed by repeated injections or a constant infusion of adrenaline.3. Prior treatment with adrenaline or noradrenaline also prevents the development of the blocking action of propranolol in the cat and in the isolated guinea-pig vas deferens.4. It is suggested that in the cat, propranolol stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla which antagonize its nerve blocking effect.", 
    "7": "1. Effects of ventricular perivascular nerve stimulation (p.n.s.) on the ventricular contractility and idioventricular rate were investigated with the blood-perfused papillary muscle of the canine right ventricle.2. Perivascular nerve stimulation of supramaximal voltage and 1 msec pulse-duration caused a definite positive inotropic response at a frequency of 1 Hz, which gradually reached a maximum at 15 to 20 Hz when the papillary muscle was electrically driven at 120 beats/min at a constant temperature of 38-39 degrees C. The frequency-response curve was sigmoid.3. The spontaneous regular idioventricular rate of 46+/-4 beats/min was accelerated to at most 60+/-4 beats/min (n=11) by p.n.s. The stimulus frequency-response relations between chronotropic and inotropic responses to p.n.s. were almost the same.4. Tetrodotoxin blocked completely the responses to p.n.s. while it had little or no effect on the inotropic response to exogenous noradrenaline.5. Positive inotropic responses to p.n.s. were diminished by beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (alprenolol, propranolol and pindolol) and were enhanced during infusion of cocaine.6. In reserpine- or guanethidine-pretreated muscles, p.n.s. as well as field stimulation produced negative inotropic responses, which were enhanced by physostigmine and were blocked by atropine.7. Hexamethonium enhanced slightly the positive inotropic responses to p.n.s. as well as field stimulation.8. It was concluded that the perivascular nerves of the coronary artery of the canine ventricle are mainly composed of postganglionic adrenergic fibres but there are also pre- and postganglionic cholinergic nerve fibres.", 
    "8": "1. In dogs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone sodium, bradycardia with hypotension occurred on intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of noradrenaline (50-200 mug) or phenylephrine (100-400 mug), but tachycardia with hypotension occurred on i.c.v. injection of isoprenaline (100-200 mug).2. These cardiovascular responses were central effects, and from the results obtained after bilateral vagotomy, removal of both stellate ganglia and transection of the upper cervical cord, it was evident that the efferent nervous pathway for all these effects was the sympathetic nervous system.3. An i.c.v. injection of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine (10 mg) blocked the bradycardia and hypotension produced by noradrenaline or phenylephrine, and an i.c.v. injection of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, either propranolol (2 mg) or N-isopropyl-p-nitrophenyl-ethanolamine (INPEA) (10 mg), blocked the tachycardia and hypotension produced by isoprenaline.4. The cardiovascular effects produced by i.c.v. injection of the three sympathomimetic amines could be reproduced in cross-circulation experiments in the recipient dog when the amines were injected into its head circulation, and the effects of noradrenaline and phenylephrine, but not those of isoprenaline, were abolished by the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent yohimbine (1 mg/kg) injected intravenously into the donor dog.5. It is concluded that the central alpha-adrenoceptors are concerned with bradycardia and the central beta-adrenoceptors with tachycardia, but that both receptors are concerned with hypotension.", 
    "9": "The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade with oxprenolol upon adrenaline-induced relaxation of strips of human sigmoid colon was investigated. Following blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with oxprenolol, adrenaline evoked dose-dependent contractions of both longitudinal and circular muscle strips. Storage of the tissues for periods up to 24 hours at 4 degrees C did not modify the responses to adrenaline. Furthermore, the contractions induced by adrenaline following oxprenolol were significantly diminished by the addition of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent. Our results would suggest that oxprenolol has the property of unmasking or revealing alpha receptors responsible for the excitatory effects of adrenaline upon isolated strips of human colon.", 
    "10": "1. The effect of catecholamines on the time course and amplitude of contraction and on KCl-induced contractures has been studied in mammalian hearts.2. Marked and reproducible contractures could be obtained in mammalian ventricular trabeculae and papillary muscles after beta-adrenergic block with propanolol or if the hearts were depleted of their catecholamine stores by reserpine or by chemical denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine.3. In neonatal hearts with lower endogenous catecholamine stores and poorly developed sarcoplasmic reticulum KCl contractures are easily produced.4. Catecholamines potentiate twitch tension and relax the contracture tension under all of the above circumstances.5. The relaxant effect of catecholamines is present during the time course of a twitch. This increased relaxation rate as well as the shortening of the time-to-peak of tension is independent of the variation in the duration of the action potential.6. The shortened relaxation time is present when the action potential is shortened with anodal repolarization or prolonged with cathodal depolarization (voltage-clamp).7. The relaxant effect of catecholamines on the twitch is temperature and rate dependent. The effect is observed in the presence of high or low concentrations of calcium.8. The presence of catecholamines is necessary for full relaxation of mammalian heart muscle under high performance conditions or states of calcium overload.9. It is proposed that catecholamines exert their relaxant effect independent of their positive inotropic effect by stimulating the sequestering system (sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria or sarcolemma) for calcium."
