Erythroid colony growth in cultures form euthyroid dogs was enhanced by isoproterenol and other adrenergic agonists having beta 2-receptor specificity. With hypothyroidism, however, this responsiveness was lost, and sensitivity to alpha-agonists, such as phenylephrine and norepinephrine, was acquired. This alteration in receptor specificity appeared to be dependent upon thyroid hormone and was rapidly reversible. Preincubation of marrow cells from hypothyroid animals with thyroid hormone resulted in the reappearance of responsiveness to beta-adrenergic agonists and the loss of sensitivity to alpha-agonists. These findings are in agreement with previous suggestions that beta-adrenergic receptor activity is modulated by thyroid hormone levels and demonstrate that the specificity of adrenergic modulations of erythropoiesis in culture may accurately reflect the thyroid status of the intact animal.", 
    "1": "Using specific radioligand receptor binding assays, we have, for the first time, quantitated both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors in the musculature of the lower ureter, bladder body, posterior bladder base, and proximal urethra of the dog, and in the bladder base and body of the rabbit. For the beta receptor assay 3H-dihydroalprenolol was used as the ligand, and, for the alpha receptor assay, 3H-dihydroergocryptine was used. In the dog, there was a significantly greater density of beta receptors in the bladder body than in either the ureter or the posterior bladder base. The urethra had an intermediate density. The bladder base and the proximal urethra had a significantly greater density of alpha receptors than either the ureter or the bladder dome. The dissociation constant of beta receptors for DHA was approximately 9 nM for all tissues studied, and that of alpha receptors for DHE approximately 7 nM. A similar distribution of alpha-and beta adrenergic receptors was seen in the rabbit bladder.", 
    "2": "The appearance of a psoriasiform eruption in a seventy-eight year old patient after one year of treatment with propranolol is presented herein. The histologic picture was not compatible with psoriasis vulgaris, although it contained some of the same features. Immunologic investigation revealed immune deposits at the junction of the dermis and epidermis and in blood vessel walls as well as monoclonal gammopathy. The rash, which was followed by a reduction in tear secretion, is suggested to have been a drug reaction associated with propranolol. This is supported by the positive results of a migration inhibiting factor test towards propranolol, the clearing of the eruption which took place three weeks after withdrawal of the drug, and the negative result of the same test obtained soon afterwards.", 
    "3": "The ATP and lactate contents of erythrocytes from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) were measured before and after incubation with or without glucose plus either ouabain or propranolol. Samples from patients and controls were obtained at almost the same time on the same day and processed simultaneously. The erythrocyte ATP content differed in adults and children, but there was no difference between DMD patients and age-matched controls. Ouabain suppressed, and propranolol enhanced, the changes of ATP and lactate, to the same extent in patients and in controls. We found no gross abnormalities in generation and utilization of ATP in erythrocytes in DMD, and the response to ouabain or propranolol appeared normal.", 
    "4": "1. The metabolism of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent practolol has been studied in a variety of small animal species, using both ring- and acetyl-14C-labelled material. After oral dosing at 100 mg/kg, elimination of 14C in urine and expired air was monitored, and urinary metabolite patterns were examined by t.l.c. 2. Marmoset was unusual in extensively deacetylating practolol (c. 57% dose). Urinary elimination was low, with only 25% being recovered in 4 days; over 30% of urinary 14C was present as desacetyl practolol, whereas less than 50% was unchanged practolol. 3. Hamster was also atypical, in its extensive hydroxylation of practolol. Urine contained 60% dose; 11% of urinary radioactivity was present as 3-hydroxypractolol, much of the polar material present (48%) appeared to be a conjugate of this, and only 35% was present as practolol. 4. For the other species studied (rat, mouse, guinea-pig and rabbit, metabolism was more limited. Deacetylation was typically about 5%, but was somewhat higher in the mouse (8--14%). Urine was the major route of elimination and practolol represented 50--90% of urinary radioactivity. 5. Despite extensive toxicity studies, both in species which metabolize practolol similarly to man and in species such as the hamster and marmoset which metabolize practolol extensively, no animal model has been found for the human adverse reactions.", 
    "5": "A single blind randomized parallel study designed to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of pindolol and nifedipine was carried out in 42 ambulatory coronary patients with stable angina pectoris. Drug efficacy was assessed in terms of (a) pain, (b) frequency of anginal episodes, (c) nitroglycerin consumption, (d) exercise tolerance and (e) ST-segment changes. The effect of these drugs on asymptomatic resting myocardial ischemia was also assessed by means of 24-h dynamic electrocardiography (DCG). All patients were checked at weekly intervals. At the end of a 4-wk placebo period, the patients were randomly assigned either to the pindolol or nifedipine group. The treatment lasted for 45 days. During the placebo period, ischemic ECG changes and symptoms of coronary insufficiency were detected in all patients. Furthermore, 12 out of 42 patients had asymptomatic myocardial ischemia at rest. One patient from each group was dropped because of tolerance. At the end of the 45-day study, pindolol and nifedipine were equi-effective on spontaneous and effort-related angina. There were, however, some differences: increased tolerance to exercise appeared earlier with pindolol: the pindolol group showed a slightly reduced while the nifedipine group showed a slightly increased heart rate. Furthermore, nifedipine reduced or eliminated asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in 6 out of 7 patients while only 1 out of 5 improved in the pindolol group.", 
    "6": "beta-Adrenoceptors were labeled with the selective beta-antagonist (-)[3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). Cardiac membranes isolated from renal hypertensive rats had the same density of adrenoceptors as normotensive rats (28 fmoles/mg of protein in both groups) but showed a significant elevation of the dissociation constant for [3H]DHA (Kd = 1.86 nM versus 1.04 nM for controls), indicating a reduced affinity of cardiac adrenoceptors for the radioligant. The lowered sensitivity to catecholamine is probably due to chronic exposure of beta-receptors to a high concentration of noradrenaline, whose turnover in cardiac nerves of renal hypertensive rats was significantly accelerated (turnover time 10.5 hr for hypertensive versus 17.2 for normotensive).", 
    "7": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents propranolol and timolol on the initial calcium uptake velocity of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles of rabbit skeletal muscle were studied. Racemic d- and l-propranolol had similar inhibitory effects on initial calcium uptake velocity, which was inhibited 50% by 5--7 X 10(-4) M racemic propranolol. Timolol was a much less potent inhibitor of initial calcim uptake velocity; 50% inhibition occurred at approximately 10(-2) M timolol. Both drugs inhibited maximal calcium uptake velocity; however, KCa (the Ca2+ concentration at which calcium uptake was half-maximal) was modified differently. Propranolol increased KCa, whereas timolol caused the KCa to decrease. Addition of either drug to an ongoing calcium uptake reaction at the time that calcium content became maximal caused renewed calcium uptake. The relative potencies of propranolol and timolol as negative inotropic agents are similar to their potencies as inhibitors of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake, but dissimilar to their beta-adrenergic receptor blocking potencies. Timolol, which has been reported to have less negative inotropic effect than propranolol, is approximately 5 time more potent than propranolol as a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent but 15 times less potent as an inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake. Inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake may thus characterize negative inotropic potencies of new beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents.", 
    "8": "The opposing effects on blood pressure of clonidine and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists which have been observed in some hypertensive patients were studied in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats. Daily treament with clonidine (100 micrograms/kg, given by gavage) for 2 weeks significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate. After 2 weeks of treatment with clonidine, administration by gavage of d,l-propranolol (10 mg/kg daily) or sotalol (10 mg/kg daily) or intraperitoneal injection of H 35/25 [d,1-erythro-4-methyl-alpha-(1-isopropylaminoethyl)-genzylalcohol hydrochloride] (10 mg/kg daily) concomitantly with clonidine significantly counteracted the hypotensive action of clonidine. d-Propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol (all 10 mg/kg daily) had no such effect. All drugs except d-propranolol and H 35/25, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, enhanced the bradycardic action of clonidine. These findings suggest that the pressor effect of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents during treatment with clonidine occurs at the level of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the periphery.", 
    "9": "The cardiac electrophysiology of flecainide a new antiarrhythmic agent, was studied in open-chested dogs. At plasma concentrations of 0.4 to 0.7 microgram/ml, flecainide significantly prolonged atrioventricular (AV) conduction. At plasma concentrations greater than 6.5 micrograms/ml, flecainide caused delay throughout the conduction system (77--240%). Low plasma levels of flecainide caused slight prolongation in atrial effective refractory period and AV nodal functional and relative refractory periods. At flecainide levels of 0.7 microgram/ml, ventricular response during atrial fibrillation was significantly slowed. The effects of flecainide on AV nodal and infranodal conduction and refractoriness were significantly enhanced by d,1-propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) but were unaffected by ouabain (0.01 mg/kg). The ventricular fibrillation threshold of supraventricular beats and ventricular premature beats increased with increasing plasma flecainide concentration (122% at 9.3 micrograms/ml and 172% at 1.3 micrograms/ml, respectively). Flecainide slowed ectopic atrial and ventricular pacemakers without affecting sinusor junctional pacemakers.", 
    "10": "Sodium nitroprusside infused intravenously into conscious rabbits lowered blood pressure and raised heart rate and plasma noradrenaline. Acute beta blockade with propranolol, 2 mg/kg/hr i.v. for 2 hr, increased resting plasma noradrenaline and did not change the hypotensive effects of nitroprusside or the rise in plasma noradrenaline but attenuated the increase in heart rate. Chronic treatment with propranolol, 2 mg/kg twice daily for 3 weeks, did not modify the cardiovascular or reflex effects of nitroprusside. However, bilateral sinoaortic denervation augmented the hypotensive effect of nitroprusside and abolished both the heart rate and plasma noradrenaline responses to the vasodilator. The fall in blood pressure after nitroprusside is therefore attenuated by baroreflex mechanisms, which did not appear to be mediated by beta adrenoceptors or by withdrawal of vagal tone but could involve alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. Propranolol does not lower noradrenaline or modify the increase in noradrenaline after sodium nitroprusside.", 
    "11": "The incidence, mortality, physiology, clinical findings and diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma are reviewed. Treatment, after adequate medical stabilization, must be surgical because of the high incidence of malignancy. Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in the preoperative period was discussed. Anaesthetic management of patients with phaeochromocytoma requires close monitoring. Virtually all inhalational anaesthetic agents have been used in cases of phaeochromocytoma. Recent reports have favored enflurane. The merits of neuroleptanaesthesia and the various muscle relaxants are also discussed. Most authors favour lidocaine over propranolol for management of dysrhythmias during operation. Phentolamine or sodium nitroprusside are used for hypertension during operation. Hypotension is treated by fluid replacement with nor-epinephrine if a vasopressor becomes necessary. Close monitoring is necessary in the postoperative period. Adequate urinary output is of more importance than actual blood pressure levels.", 
    "12": "The effect of treatment for 1--4 weeks with metoprolol, a beta 1-selective blocking agent, or alprenolol, on the heart rate and blood pressure response to isometric exercise was studied in two groups of 12 patients with angina. Measurements were made during the peak effect of metoprolol 10, 40 or 50 mg, and alprenolol 200 mg as Aptin Durules. After 1 min of sustained handgrip at 50% of maximal voluntary contraction, systolic (6--15%) and diastolic (8--12%) blood pressure after both drugs was significantly lower than without any beta-blockade; Heart rate was decreased by 19--22% by metroprolol but not by alprenolol. The blood pressure rise during handgrip was not attenuated by either drug. The rise in heart rate was significantly reduced (by 36--50%) by metoprolol 40 and 50 mg and alprenolol 200 mg. No patient experienced angina during handgrip. In contrast, all but one were restricted by angina during bycycle exercise without treatment, at a level that produced the same increase in heart rate as the handgrip test, vis. 3 min at a load of 33 W). The cardiovascular response to sustained handgrip is too small to provide a useful challenge for determinatin of the anti-anginal efficacy of drugs. However, slight ECG changes of ischaemia did occur during handgrip, which were reversed by beta-blockade.", 
    "13": "The acute effects upon blood pressure and sympathetic outflow of two beta adrenoceptor blocking drugs, propranolol and atenolol, are described in five healthy normotensive subjects. Supine blood pressure, heart rate, plasma noradrenaline, and urinary catecholamine excretion were measured before and at intervals for 24 h after a single oral dose of either propranolol 200 mg, atenolol 100 mg, or placebo. Propranolol caused a fall in blood pressure and heart rate of 17.2/14.1 mm Hg and 20.4 beats/min respectively two hours after dose. Atenolol caused a fall in blood pressure of 11.4/18.6 mm Hg within 7 h of the dose, and a fall in heart rate of 13.8 beats/min after 2 h. The reduction in blood pressure after single high dose beta adrenoceptor blockade is established. The synchronous reduction in blood pressure and heart rate after propranolol was not associated with an increase in peripheral sympathietic activity as assessed by the biochemical indices. It is conceivable that the reduction in blood pressure during beta adrenoceptor blockade may be due in part to inappropriately low sympathetic activity but this cannot be the main mechanism of pressure reduction.", 
    "14": "The effects of histamine infusions on the rat uterine vasculature have been studied using the radioactive microsphere technique. Histamine produced a marked uterine vasodilatation which could be partly mimicked by infusion of either the H1-receptor agonist, 2-(2-aminoethyl)pyridine, or the H2-receptor agonist, 4-methyl-histamine. Histamine-induced uterine vasodilatation could only be reduced significantly by administration of a combination of the H1- and H2-receptor antagonists mepyramine and metiamide but not by either antagonist given alone. It was concluded that histamine-induced vasodilatation in the rat uterus is mediated by both H1- and H2-receptors.", 
    "15": "The sudden development of a red painful eye with blurred vision may be an acute attack of angle closure glaucoma which requires emergency attention. Once the attack is controlled with medication, surgical intervention with a peripheral iridectomy is indicated to relieve relative pupillary block. Eyes subject to angle closure glaucoma are anatomically different with 'crowded' anterior segments. In contrast, open angle glaucoma (the more common form) may progress to near blindness without symptoms. Routine screening of intraocular pressure is, therefore, necessary to make the diagnosis before extensive irreparable damage has occurred. Surgery for open angle glaucoma carries risks of cataract and infection, and is unpredictable. Open angle glaucoma patients are usually treated chronically with specific medications. Beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents appear to provide a significant new addition to the currently available antiglaucoma medications.", 
    "16": "The electrocardiographic (ECG) signs of ST-segment elevation and the development of Q was using 72-lead precordial surface mapping, and the release of creatine kinase (CK) activity has been studied in 47 patients with uncomplicated anterior myocardial infarction. These findings were compared with a further nine patients who had acute myocardial infarction but were receiving long-term beta-blocking drugs. It was found that ST-segment elevation and Q waves had rapidly changing and different natural histories and that beta-blocking drugs altered the natural history of ST-segment changes but had no effect on the pattern and time course for the loss of electrically active myocardium. There was a close relationship between the precordial area of ST-segment elevation at 2--3 h and the final development of Q waves in the patients with uncomplicated anterior myocardial infarction. No similar relationship could be found in those on beta-blocking drugs. The pattern of changes in plasma CK and its MB isoenzymes activity were similar for both groups. The relationship between early ST-segment elevation and the final area of Q waves may prove useful in clinical practice. This may not apply where beta-blocking drugs are commenced before the initial recording of ST-segment elevation.", 
    "17": "A prospective assessment of the effects of minoxidil on the ECG was carried out in a series of 80 patients with severe hypertension, representing an observation of 139.6 patient years. In combination with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and diuretics, minoxidil resulted in substantial reductions in blood pressure at rest and during exercise. Concomitant with the initiation of minoxidil treatment, ECG changes consisting of flattening or inversion of the T waves, ranging from slight to very marked, were observed in 90% of the patients. While these changes may be potentially disconcerting, the observations of this study show that they are not related to changes in heart rate or other clinical criteria associated with myocardial ischemia. They are not influenced by exercise or beta-blockade and they generally revert to control appearance during chronic treatment, at which time accompanying improvement in preexisting abnormalities of the T wave was frequently seen. During long-term treatment, a substantial reduction of increased QRS voltages was observed.", 
    "18": "Tricyclic antidepressants have anticholinergic, adrenolytic and quinidine-like activity. These actions result in a variety of cardiac and blood pressure effects. Tricyclic antidepressants can reverse the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and clonidine. Orthostatic hypotension may be increased with diuretics and hydralazine. Myocardial depression may occur with lidocaine, phenytoin or propranolol. Dangerous additive effects may result from concomitant use of a tricyclic antidepressant and either quinidine or procainamide.", 
    "19": "To further characterize mechanisms of glucose counterregulation in man, the effects of pharmacologically inducd deficiencies of glucagon, growth hormone, and catecholamines (alone and in combination) on recovery of plasma glucose from insulin-induced hypoglycemia and attendant changes in isotopically ([3-(3)H]glucose) determined glucose fluxes were studied in 13 normal subjects. In control studies, recovery of plasma glucose from hypoglycemia was primarily due to a compensatory increase in glucose production; the temporal relationship of glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone responses with the compensatory increase in glucose appearance was compatible with potential participation of all these hormones in acute glucose counterregulation. Infusion of somatostatin (combined deficiency of glucagon and growth hormone) accentuated insulin-induced hypoglycemia (plasma glucose nadir: 36+/-2 ng/dl during infusion of somatostatin vs. 47+/-2 mg/dl in control studies, P < 0.01) and impaired restoration of normoglycemia (plasma glucose at min 90: 73+/-3 mg/dl at end of somatostatin infusion vs. 92+/-3 mg/dl in control studies, P<0.01). This impaired recovery of plasma glucose was due to blunting of the compensatory increase in glucose appearance since glucose disappearance was not augmented, and was attributable to suppression of glucagon secretion rather than growth hormone secretion since these effects of somatostatin were not observed during simultaneous infusion of somatostatin and glucagon whereas infusion of growth hormone along with somatostatin did not prevent the effect of somatostatin. The attenuated recovery of plasma glucose from hypoglycemia observed during somatostatin-induced glucagon deficiency was associated with plasma epinephrine levels twice those observed in control studies. Infusion of phentolamine plus propranolol (combined alpha-and beta-adrenergic blockade) had no effect on plasma glucose or glucose fluxes after insulin administration. However, infusion of somatostatin along with both phentolamine and propranolol further impaired recovery of plasma glucose from hypoglycemia compared to that observed with somatostatin alone (plasma glucose at end of infusions: 52+/-6 mg/dl for somatostatin-phentolamine-propranolol vs. 72+/-5 mg/dl for somatostatin alone, P < 0.01); this was due to further suppression of the compensatory increase in glucose appearance (maximal values: 1.93+/-0.41 mg/kg per min for somatostatin-phentolamine-propranolol vs. 2.86+/-0.32 mg/kg per min for somatostatin alone, P < 0.05). These results indicate that in man (a) restoration of normoglycemia after insulin-induced hypoglycemia is primarily due to a compensatory increase in glucose production; (b) intact glucagon secretion, but not growth hormone secretion, is necessary for normal glucose counterregulation, and (c) adrenergic mechanisms do not normally play an essential role in this process but become critical to recovery from hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is impaired.", 
    "20": "The outcome of 54 pregnancies in 23 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was analysed. No mother or infant died in the perinatal period. Six patients developed dyspnoea requiring treatment with diuretics. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs were given in 18 pregnancies and three of the infants in this were small for dates and in two fetal bradycardia occurred. The results comfirmed that pregnancy is safe in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A flexible approach should be adopted towards administering beta-adrenergic blocking drugs to pregnant women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many such patients do well without these drugs and can thus avoid the potential hazards--namely, small-for-dates babies and fetal bradycardia--that are associated with them.", 
    "21": "The recent discovery of histamine (H) receptors in the heart raises the possibility that the H2-antagonist drug, cimetidine, used in the therapy of peptic ulcer, might have cardiac side-effects and might impair the cardiac response to exercise. In 10 normal subjects, cimetidine did not alter the normal heart rate and blood pressure response to treadmill exercise, nor was the effect of beta-blockade by propranolol exaggerated. Thus it appears that the use of propranolol is not necessarily a contraindication to cimetidine therapy, or vice versa. However, further trials on patients with ischaemic heart disease are required to exclude any additive effects of cimetidine and propranolol on the diseased heart.", 
    "22": "A randomized double-blind crossover trial of labetalol, bendrofluazide and placebo was carried out in 18 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The reduction in blood pressure observed with labetalol and bendrofluazide was similar. The plasma levels of labetalol showed a significant correlation with changes in blood pressure (r = 0.07; P less than 0.021); and plasma level determinations of this drug may be of value in the management of patients who receive antihypertensive agents.", 
    "23": "Twenty-seven patients with mild to moderate arterial hypertension were treated \"double-blind\" with either atenolol of oxprenolol. Placebo was given for four weeks before the beta-blocking drugs were administered. Atenolol was given in doses of either 50 mg twice a day, 100 mg twice a day or 100 mg once a day for periods of four weeks. Oxprenolol was given in doses of either 80 mg or 160 mg twice a day for the same duration. Patients were assessed at the end of each four-week period. The mean blood pressure and pulse rate did not vary significantly for the two different dose regimens at which each drug was administered. There was no statistical difference between the reduction of systolic blood pressure produced by the two drugs, but there was a significant difference in the reduction in diastolic blood pressure in favour of atenolol (P less than 0.05 supine; P less than 0.01 erect). A single, 100-mg daily dose of atenolol was just as effective as 50 mg or 100 mg twice a day. Similarly, an 80 mg twice a day dose of oxprenolol was just as effective as that of 160 mg twice a day. Side effects for each drug were not statistically different from those recorded with placebo.", 
    "24": "24 patients with congestive cardiomyopathy (group I) were compared with a group of 13 controls with similar clinical findings and myocardial function who were selected retrospectively (group II) . All patients received digitalis and diuretics, but group I patients received beta-blockers as well. The survival-rate in group I patients (83%, 66%, and 52% after one, two, and three years respectively) differed significantly from that in group II subjects (46%, 19%, and 10%, respectively). This finding is supported by the demonstration that beta-blockade improved myocardial function in group I subjects. It is therefore suggested that beta-blockade prolongs survival in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy.", 
    "25": "Systemic treatment with d-amphetamine produced a dose-dependent increase in the circling behavior of normal mice. Treatment with both alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MpT) and FLA-63 antagonized the amphetamine-induced circling behavior. Similarly, blockade of B-adrenergic receptors by propranolol and dopamine receptors by haloperidol reversed the circling response elicited by amphetamine. In contrast to alpha-MpT and haloperidol, however, neither FLA-63 nor propranolol attenuated the locomotor excitation engendered by amphetamine. Following repeated d-amphetamine injections the circling ordinarily induced by a single injection was abolished, whereas the locomotor effects of amphetamine remained unaltered. These findings are consistent with earlier work suggesting that tolerance may occur in those behaviors that involve a noradrenergic component.", 
    "26": "Recent reports have suggested that high doses of propranolol may be an effective treatment in schizophrenia. To determine whether such treatment has effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amine metabolites and prolactin similar to the effects of the neuroleptic drugs, we studied CSF from ten patients before and after propanolol therapy. The initial CSF sample was removed after a drug-free period and propranolol dosage was then increased over 1 week to 1000 mg daily in all ten patients. A second CSF sample was removed after 3 weeks of propranolol therapy. Propranolol levels and prolactin in CSF were measured by radioimmunoassay. Homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Propranolol had no effect on the prolactin or amine metabolite concentrations. CSF propranolol levels averaged 40 ng/ml (range less than 1--78).", 
    "27": "1. The influence of (+)-propranolol, 10(-6) to 4 x 10(-5) mol/l, upon the positive inotropic effect of dihydro-ouabain was studied on guinea-pig papillary muscle. At 1 Hz, negative inotropically effective concentrations of (+)-propranolol decreased the inotropic effectiveness of the glycoside. 2. For equivalent diminution of the basal force of contraction, either by reduction of stimulation frequency or by increasing concentrations of (+)-propranolol, a similar decrease in the inotropic effectiveness of dihydro-ouabain was observed. In contract, reduction of [Ca2+]o had almost no effect on the effectiveness of the glycoside. 3. The inhibitory effect of (+)-propranolol on the inotropic effectiveness of dihydro-ouabain declined with reduction of stimulation frequency. At any stimulation frequency tested, the inhibitory effect of (+)-propranolol was proportional to the effect of a reduction of that particular frequency to the rested-state condition in the absence of (+)-propranolol. 4. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the inhibition of the excitation-coupled sodium influx by (+)-propranolol is the cause of its inhibiting effect on the effectiveness of dihydro-ouabain.", 
    "28": "Fifty-three pregnant women with moderately severe hypertension were randomly allocated to treatment with methyldopa or oxprenolol. There were no significant differences between the groups in age, height, weight, parity, or stage of gestation at the start of treatment. The outcome of pregnancy was better in the group treated with oxprenolol, with greater maternal plasma volume expansion and placental and fetal growth. No intrauterine deaths occurred in either group, and antepartum fetal distress, detected by oxytocin challenge testing, was evident in only one patient, who received methyldopa. This infant, and one other in the methyldopa group, died in the neonatal period. No neonatal deaths occurred in the oxprenolol-treated group. Even in this small number of patients these results were considerably better than those in untreated women with hypertension of similar severity. Apgar scores in both groups were equivalent at birth, while blood sugar concentrations were higher in the oxprenolol group. Oxprenolol appears to be safe and effective in controlling hypertension during pregnancy. There was no evidence of harmful effects on the fetus, and oxprenolol may offer a selective advantage over methyldopa for fetal growth and wellbeing in utero.", 
    "29": "d,l-Propranolol (1 and 5 mg/kg s.c.) did not cause a fall in blood pressure and induced only a limited decrease in heart rate in conscious spontaneously) hypertensive rats (SHR). In contrast, after bilateral adrenalectomy, d,l-propranolol induced a rapid and profound decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. Decreases in heart rate and blood pressure in the individual animals were not correlated. The effects were mainly caused by l-propranolol but an additional effect of d-propranolol cannot be excluded. The decrease in blood pressure was not observed after removal of the adrenal medulla. Heart rate decreased only slightly in these animals. After treatment of adrenalectomized SHR with corticosterone (1 mg/kg b.w./h) the decrease in blood pressure due to d,l-propranolol was completely abolished. The fall in heart rate was diminished. Central injection of d,l-propranolol into the lateral brain ventricle of adrenalectomized SHR caused cardiovascular changes which were less pronounced than those following peripheral injection of comparable doses. The inhibitory effects of d,l-propranolol also occurred in adrenalectomized normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. However, no significant changes in blood pressure and only a limited fall in heart rate were observed in adrenalectomized normotensive and renal hypertensive Wistar rats. It is concluded that the presence of the adrenal cortex, but not of the adrenal medulla prevents acute hypotension and bradycardia after propranolol in the conscious SHR.", 
    "30": "In pigeon erythrocyte membrane, the beta-adrenergic receptor and the enzyme adenylate cyclase can be uncoupled in two different ways depending on the type of drug used. Cationic drugs: chlorpromazine, methochlorpromazine, tetracaine, n-octylamine and a neutral alcohol, octanol, abolished alprenolol receptor binding ability and in the same range of concentration of the drug, sensitized adenylate cyclase to fluoride or Gpp(NH)p stimulation. Anionic drugs: di- and trinitro-phenols, indomethacin and octanoic acid did not affect the total number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites and, with the exception of trinitrophenol, did not change the association constant for alprenolol but they abolished the stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol, fluoride or Gpp(NH)p. These modifications of the adenylate cyclase system occurred in a range of drug concentration where cell shape and protection against hemolysis were also affected. As chemical composition varies widely from one drug to another, it is suggested that these effects are largely nonspecific and mediated by the lipid bilayer. They are probably related to a preferential sidedness of action of the drugs in the lipid bilayer, displaying the role of an asymmetric control of the adenylate cyclase system in the membrane by the two halves of this bilayer.", 
    "31": "Thirty patients with mild to sever essential hypertension, satisfactorily controlled by twice daily Sotalol 80 to 320mg/day, entered a double-blind, crossover study comparing the efficacy, tolerability and safety of their usual twice daily dose of Sotalol with the same total dose given once a daily. Each double-blind period was eight weeks long; during it blood pressure and pulse rate were measured in each patient's home at 8-10 a.m., 12-2 p.m. and 8-10 p.m., on alternate days during the last week of each treatment period. There was no significant difference in bloodpressure or pulse rate betwen each regime for the three readings during the day. The mean serum concentration of Sotalol twenty-four hours after once daily administration was not sigificantly lower than the concentration 12 h after twice daily administration. Once daily dosage did not cause any problems of tolerance.", 
    "32": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects of pindolol were compared with those of a placebo in a double-blind trial in twelve hypertensive Africans. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured at rest and immediately after exercise, before and at intervals up to 8 h after oral administration of the drugs. Plasma levels of pindolol were also determined. Pindolol reduced systolic blood pressure and antagonised exercised-induced tachycardia. The mean time to peak level of pindolol was 1.9 h and the mean half-life was 4.2 h. Comparison of plasma levels of pindolol and beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity showed good correlation between them. It is concluded that the pharmacokinetics and beta-blocking effects of pindolol in Africans are not dissimilar from published data for other races.", 
    "33": "Intra-arterial pressure was recorded over 24 h in hypertensive patients before and during long-term treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists given once daily under standardised conditions. Arterial pressure was reduced throughout the 24 h after the last dose as was variability of pressure during physical activity; variability during sleep and rest did not change significantly.", 
    "34": "One hundred and eight patients suffering from hypertension due to a unilateral parenchymatous neophropathy were studied over a period of one to eight years after treatment was starded. The aetiologies were diverse: harmonious hypoplasia, segmental hypoplasia, pyelonephritis, reflux nephropathy, hydronephrosis and tuberculosis. Thirty nine patients were treated surgically, with 50% good results. In 82 cases medical treatment was continued for at least a year with a 52% success rate. Such success was recorded in 94% of cases in which beta-blockers were used (38 cases). Surgical success was not dependent upon the period for which hypertension had been present. The best results were seen in cases of hydronephrosis and pyelonephritis and the worst in tuberculosis. Thirteen patients underwent surgery event though there was no unilateral increase in plasma renin levels. Seven were improved or cured. Ten patients underwent surgery with a renin activity 50% greater than on the healthy side, 9 being improved or cured. Treatment with beta-blockers, alone or in association with diuretics, controlled blood pressure in 90% of cases, regardless of the renin activity. Plasma renin activity in the renal veins is of good prognostic value in terms of the effectiveness of nephrectomy against hypertension. In Call cases, beta-blockers were more effective than surgery.", 
    "35": "The treatment of hypertension requires in many cases a therapeutic combination. This survey, carried out in 96 cases, shows the interest of a fixed combination including a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), a potassium sparing (chlorhydrate of amiloride) and a beta-blocking agent (timolol maleate) as compared to therapy with a beta-blocking agent or diuretic alone. This combination, logical from a pharmacological view point, has proved significantly more effective (81% of patients were normalized) and as well tolerated (none additional side effect) as each of its components. As it simplifies prescription by reducing the number of tablets, it appears a considerable contribution to hypertension therapy.", 
    "36": "In 23 patients with essential hypertension of stage I and II according to the WHO, the effects of a fixed combination of a beta-receptor-blocker plus saluretic composed of 20 mg of metipranolol (Disorat 20) and 2.5 mg of butizid (Saltucin) = Torrat on blood pressure and important metabolic parameters (glucose, glucose tolerance, cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid, plasma potassium and whole body potassium) were tested over a 6-month treatment period.", 
    "37": "blood pressure and pulse rate were significantly reduced; bradycardia (pulse rate less than 60/min) was not observed. The metabolic parameters showed no significant changes during the 6-month treatment period. In no case did the therapy have to be discontinued because of undesirable effects. The investigations show that the combination has a good antihypertensive effect with few side-effects and that it has no influence on important metabolic parameters during long-term therapy.", 
    "38": "Perhexiline maleate was used as a prophylactic agent in 26 patients suffering from severe angina pectoris. The mean duration of treatment was 8.9 months, with a maximum of 28 months. Fifteen patients experienced a reduction in frequency of attacks to less than one-third of their previous level; six experienced a reduction to two-thirds of their previous level; no patient showed an increase in attack rates. During the period of study, there was one death. Frequently observed side effects included dizziness, gastrointestinal irritation and malaise. One patient developed clinically apparent hepatic dysfunction which resolved on withdrawal of perhexiline maleate, but recurred after rechallenge with a lower dose of the drug; the results of liver function tests in five others showed mild abnormalities. One patient developed peripheral neuropathy after taking perhexiline maleate for 18 months, but this resolved in two months after cessation of therapy. Good responses to perhexiline maleate were observed in patients who were concurrently treated with beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs."
