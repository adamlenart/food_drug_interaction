    "0": "Renal disease in elderly diabetic patients is costly in terms of morbidity, mortality and medical payments. Therefore, prevention of diabetic nephropathy has become a prominent goal in the treatment of diabetic patients. Preventive treatment should begin not later than at the stage of persistent microalbuminuria, and regular screening for microalbuminuria is recommended for both elderly and younger diabetic patients. Improved metabolic control, through diet and hypoglycaemic therapy, has been demonstrated to lower urinary albumin excretion. The target level of glycated haemoglobin is < 8%, or < 2% higher than the upper limit of normal in nondiabetic people. Insulin therapy has no adverse effects on renal indices, unless it increases bodyweight and consequently raises blood pressure. To preserve renal function in elderly diabetic patients, blood pressure should be kept well below 140/90 mm Hg. Treatment with ACE inhibitors may be the 'gold standard' intervention, and should be initiated at the lowest possible dosage and then titrated until the maximum tolerated dosage has been reached. Nonchronotropic calcium antagonists have been shown to be as effective as ACE inhibitors with regard to their effects on blood pressure, renal haemodynamics and urinary albumin excretion. Most dihydropyridines have been found to increase or to have no effect on urinary albumin excretion despite significant blood pressure reduction. A renoprotective action of diuretics is generally unlikely, with the possible exception of indapamide. Although beta-blockers are effective antihypertensive agents, they may not adequately preserve kidney function in diabetic patients. Because beta-blocker treatment may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, they should be reserved for patients with coronary artery disease or arrhythmias.",

FK506, an immunosuppressive drug, shows anti-gastric ulcer effects equivalent to famotidine, an H2 blocker, in rats. This study was designed to evaluate the cytoprotective mechanism of FK506 on gastric mucosa in relation to the changes in NO synthase activity.", 
    "2": "Gastric lesions were induced in rats by water immersion stress. Changes in NO synthase activity during water immersion stress treatment, and effects of FK506 on NO synthase activity were determined enzymatically. Gastric mucosal interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-2 were measured by immunoradiometric assay. Gastric mucosal blood flow was measured by hydrogen gas clearance technique.", 
    "3": "FK506 mitigated gastric lesions developed by water immersion stress. Stress-induced lesions were exacerbated by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of NO synthase, while sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, mitigated the lesions. Water immersion stress increased NO synthase activity in the early phase (0.5 h after stress treatment) and decreased it in the late phase (6 h after). Decrease in NO synthase activity in the late phase was significantly mitigated by FK506, though it did not affect changes in NO synthase activity in the early phase. Water immersion stress increased gastric mucosal IL-1 beta and IL-2 contents 6 h after stress treatment, and these increases were prevented by FK506. FK506 itself did not affect gastric mucosal blood flow. L-NMMA treatment significantly decreased gastric mucosal blood flow. In contrast, gastric mucosal blood flow was significantly increased by sodium nitroprusside.", 
    "4": "Increase in NO synthase activity might contribute to cytoprotection, and a decrease in activity might be a harmful factor for the gastric mucosa. Preservation of NO synthase activity by FK506 might be involved in FK506's protective effects on the gastric mucosa.", 
    "5": "The mechanism of the antidepressant action of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains unknown. Based on previous work with antidepressant drugs and their effects on the noradrenergic system, we undertook this study to further determine the effects of ECT on selected indices of peripheral adrenoceptor function in depressed patients.", 
    "6": "Binding parameters (Bmax and Kd) of platelet alpha 2- and leukocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors, plasma noradrenaline (NA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) and cortisol levels were determined in 18 patients, prior to treatment and 14 days after the last of a series of ECTs, and compared with samples obtained from 18 matched control subjects.", 
    "7": "Platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites were significantly elevated in untreated patients compared with controls (P < 0.03), but leukocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor numbers did not differ. Treatment with ECT led to a significant reduction in platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor numbers, whereas leukocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor densities increased. Pre-ECT plasma NA, MHPG, and cortisol levels were elevated in patients, compared with controls, and decreased following ECT, but these differences were not statistically significant. Post-ECT plasma NA and beta 2-adrenoceptor numbers were significantly, negatively correlated (P < 0.05).", 
    "8": "These results suggest that platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptors are supersensitive in depressed patients and treatment with ECT results in down-regulation of these receptors, which may be interpreted as a primary therapeutic, \"normalising' effect. The post-ECT changes in leukocyte beta 2-adrenoceptors are probably only secondary to the lower circulating plasma NA levels.", 
    "9": "1. Adenosine (ADO) is a potent negative chronotropic agent in the mammalian myocardium. We have used single myocytes from rabbit sino-atrial node (SAN) to examine whether nitric oxide (NO) is a significant mediator of the effects of ADO on the pacemaker activity, or the underlying Ca2+ and K+ currents. 2. SAN pacemaker cells were isolated from rabbit hearts by enzymatic dispersion, and Ca2+ and K+ currents were recorded by the nystatin-perforated patch voltage clamp method. ADO was applied in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isopremaline (Iso) to mimic the adrenergic tone which the SAN is subjected to in vivo. 3. Control experiments confirmed that isolated SAN cells responded to ADO (10-100 microM) with the expected (i) small increase in background inwardly rectifying K+ current, IK-ADOi and (ii) pronounced decrease in L-type Ca2+ current, ICa-L. These effects were mimicked by a selective A1 purinoceptor agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, 10 microM); and were inhibited following bath application of the antagonist, DPCPX (10 microM), which selectively blocks A1 purinoceptors. DMPX (10 microM), a blocker of A2 purinoceptor, had no effect on the actions of ADO. 4. A nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NMMA (100 microM), abolished the inhibitory effect of ADO on ICa-L but did not alter activation of IK-ADO. After L-NMMA washoff, it was possible to obtain the normal response (inhibition) of ICa-L to ADO in the same cell. 5. To evaluate whether the observed effect of nitric oxide (NO) on ICa-L was mediated by an increase in guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity and cyclic GMP formation, the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, LY 83583 (40 microM) was applied prior to ADO. Under these conditions, the inhibitory effect of ADO on ICa-L was abolished, but the activation of IK-ADO was still observed. 6. In combination, these findings strongly suggest that in mammalian primary pacemaker tissue which is under adrenergic tone, the effects of ADO on ICa-L are mediated by NO.", 
    "10": "1. In oesophageal smooth muscle strips from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) of 8-10 and 22-24 weeks of age, respectively, beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was investigated, by use of the beta-agonists, (-)-isoprenaline and fenoterol (both in the absence and presence of the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551) and the selective beta 3-agonist, BRL 37,344. 2. In preparations from 8-10 week SHR, (-)-isoprenaline- and fenoterol-induced concentration-response curves (CRCs) were hardly antagonized by ICI 118,551 at concentrations up to 1 microM, indicating only a minor contribution of beta 2-adrenoceptors. pA2-values for ICI 118,551 of 5.30 ((-)-isoprenaline as agonist) and 5.46 (fenoterol as agonist), estimated from the shifts at the highest (10-100 microM) antagonist concentrations, are consistent with affinity at a beta 3-adrenoceptor, similar to that in Wistar rat oesophageal smooth muscle. 3. In 8-10 week SHR, adrenodemedullated at 4 weeks of age (SHR-ADM4) the potency of fenoterol was markedly increased and CRCs were shallow. In addition, ICI 118,551 (0.1 microM) now produced a clear rightward shift accompanied by a steepening of the CRC. A marked further shift was observed only at 100 microM of the antagonist. The data are compatible with the involvement of both beta 2- and beta 3-adrenoceptors. 4. In 22-24 week animals, the same differences between SHR and SHR-ADM4 were observed with fenoterol as in 8-10 week animals, though beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness was slightly decreased. The potency of ICI 118,551 at beta 3-adrenoceptors (pA2 = 5.11) was significantly different from the pA2 value of 5.46 obtained with the younger animals. 5. Responses to the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 37,344, were similar in Wistar rat and SHR preparations. In 8-10 week SHR, a small decrease in the maximal response was observed, which in animals of 22-24 weeks of age was accompanied by a small decrease in the pEC50 value as well. 6. The results clearly indicate that beta 2-adrenoceptors in SHR oesophageal muscularis mucosae are desensitized, whereas beta 3-adrenoceptor-mediated responses are unaffected and similar to the responses observed in the Wistar rat oesophagus. The functional presence of beta 2-adrenoceptor-responses in SHR-ADM4 suggests a major role for adrenal-derived adrenaline in the desensitization of the beta 2-adrenoceptor-population.", 
    "11": "1. The effects of short- and long-term sympathectomy were evaluated on vasoconstrictor function of constantly perfused mesenteric arterial beds isolated from rats: the effects of short-term sympathectomy were assessed at 3 and 8 days after 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment of adult rats; the effects of long-term sympathectomy were assessed in adult rats treated at youth with guanethidine. 2. The relative degree of residual sympathetic innervation of the mesenteric arterial preparations was assessed by responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS; 16 Hz, 1 ms, 90 V, 30 s). Control responses were 95.6 +/- 3.9 mmHg (n = 35). Responses after sympathectomy were: 3 days after 6-OHDA, 2.9 +/- 0.9 mmHg (n = 15) < 8 days after 6-OHDA, 14.1 +/- 2.1 mmHg (n = 14) < guanethidine, 21.1 +/- 4.1 mmHg (n = 16). 3. Three days after 6-OHDA treatment there was an increase in the sensitivities of response to vasopressin and endothelin, producing leftward shifts of the dose-response curves of 0.66 +/- 0.11 and 0.88 +/- 0.13 log units respectively (n = 7-11), and a small increase in sensitivity of responses to noradrenaline (NA) and ATP. The maximal response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was increased. In contrast, there was a decrease in maximal constriction to NA and to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine did not elicit vasoconstriction at basal tone. There was no difference in vasodilator responses to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline in preparations with tone raised with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha; 0.1-0.3 microM). 4. Eight days after 6-OHDA sympathectomy there was no significant difference in sensitivities or maximal responses to ATP, vasopressin and endothelin, but a small increase in the sensitivity of responses to 5-HT. Maximal responses to NA and methoxamine were significantly lower than the controls, but sensitivities were similar. There was no significant difference in vasodilator responses to isoprenaline in PGF2 alpha-raised tone preparations. 5. After long-term guanethidine sympathectomy maximal responses to 5-HT and NA were significantly reduced. Responses to ATP, vasopressin and endothelin were unchanged. 6. In mesenteric arterial preparations from untreated rats, ouabain (0.1 mM), a blocker of the Na+/K+ pump, significantly augmented the sensitivity and maximal responses to EFS, NA, methoxamine and 5-HT. Responses to ATP, vasopressin and endothelin were unaffected. 7. It is concluded that in the rat mesenteric arterial bed, short-term sympathectomy, where only 3% of the sympathetic nerve-mediated response remained, results in non-uniform changes in sensitivity and maximal responses to different vasoconstrictors, which cannot be entirely explained by changes in the Na+/K+ pump. Most of these changes disappeared at 8 days after 6-OHDA treatment, when nerve-mediated responses had partially returned. After long-term guanethidine sympathectomy, there was little change in responses to vasoconstrictors, and nerve-mediated responses were reduced to 22%. Although the variable factors are complex, it appears that in general, changes in responses of smooth muscle to vasoconstrictor substances after sympathetic denervation only occur if there is near-complete loss of nerve-mediated responses.", 
    "12": "Calcium antagonists represent a diverse group of therapeutic agents with heterogenous pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties. It seems clear that the role of these agents in the management of patients with ischemic heart disease and hypertension is, in part, predicated on the subclass of calcium antagonists (dihydropyridine versus nondihydropyridine [heart rate-lowering]) that are used. The reports by Psaty and Furberg are important in that they remind clinicians of the fact that use of short-acting dihydropyridine agents may be associated with increased cardiac event rates in patients with ischemic heart disease and hypertension. It is our opinion, however, that there are no data that support the extrapolation of these untoward effects to the more contemporary, long-acting dihydropyridines (eg, amlodipine) or, especially, to the non-dihydropyridine (heart rate-lowering) calcium antagonists, such as diltiazem or verapamil. On the contrary, data pooled from homogeneous populations of post-MI patients from DRS, MDPIT, DAVIT-I, and DAVIT-II indicate that clinical outcomes are favorably influenced in patients recovering from non-Q wave MI, and in hypertensive post-MI patients with preserved left ventricular function. These findings support the belief that the deleterious effects observed in certain studies with short-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists represent a \"selective\" rather than a \"class action\" effect of these agents. Psaty and Furberg have assailed the absence of \"evidence-based medicine\" regarding, the utility of calcium antagonists as the most compelling argument to call for a moratorium on this broad class of therapy, pending the completion of several prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that are presently underway or planned. However, a large body of scientific evidence provides no sound basis for physicians to discontinue therapy in patients who are being treated with long acting calcium antagonists, particularly those that lower heart rate. Moreover, the available data support the use of heart rate lowering calcium antagonists in selected patients, such as those recovering from acute non-Q wave MI, who may experience long-term benefit from diltiazem or verapamil. Until the results of controlled trials are completed, these data suggest that a generic moratorium of all calcium antagonists is ill-advised.", 
    "13": "Pharmacokinetic drug interactions involving the calcium channel blocker diltiazem (DTZ) have been attributed to inhibition of microsomal cytochrome P450 (P450)-mediated drug oxidation. Accumulation of certain DTZ metabolites during dosage with the drug, as well as dose-related differences in DTZ pharmacokinetics, suggests that DTZ metabolites may also participate in P450 inhibition. The present study evaluated a series of putative DTZ metabolites as inhibitors of major constitutive P450s in rat liver in vitro, in relation to DTZ biotransformation. The principal finding to emerge was that the N-demethylated metabolite of DTZ was a more potent competitive inhibitor than DTZ of CYP3A2-dependent testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation. This P450 appeared to be the preferred target for inhibition, because the observed K/K(m) ratio for inhibition of CYP3A2-dependent steroid hydroxylation was approximately 4- and 100-fold lower than those for CYP2C11 and CYP2A1-dependent pathways, respectively. It was also established that N-desmethyl-DTZ was a major metabolite formed during microsomal DTZ biotransformation in rat liver in vitro. The other primary metabolites, desacetyl-DTZ and O-desmethyl-DTZ, were ineffective inhibitors of any pathways of steroid oxidation by P450s, but several other potential metabolites, which were not detected in microsomal incubations, also inhibited P450 activity. Consistent with previous reports, there was no evidence of P450 inactivation or complexation by DTZ, but the drug and its N-desmethyl metabolite generated binding interactions with ferric P450 in rat hepatic microsomes. Considered together, the findings of the present study establish that N-desmethyl-DTZ is a preferential inhibitor of CYP3A2 in rat hepatic microsomes, with greater potency than the parent drug. This is consistent with clinical reports in which this metabolite accumulates during multiple-dose therapy with DTZ. The competitive nature of the inhibitory interaction suggests that the eventual elimination of N-desmethyl-DTZ should restore normal hepatic oxidation capacity.", 
    "14": "Neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid NG108-15 cells were transfected to express stably either the wild-type human beta2-adrenoceptor or a constitutively active mutant (CAM) version of this receptor. Basal adenylyl cyclase activity in cells expressing the CAM beta2-adrenoceptor correlated well with the level of expression of the receptor and was substantially greater than that in cells expressing the wild-type beta2-adrenoceptor. The CAM beta2-adrenoceptor displayed higher affinity for the agonist isoprenaline than the wild-type receptor but not for the antagonist alprenolol or the inverse agonist betaxolol. Pretreatment of cells harboring the CAM beta2-adrenoceptor with betaxolol resulted in a large (4-7-fold within 24 hr) up-regulation in levels of this receptor. This was not observed after exposure of the CAM beta2-adrenoceptor-expressing cells to alprenolol, and a much smaller effect of betaxolol was produced in cells expressing the wild-type receptor. Betaxolol-mediated up-regulation of the CAM beta2-adrenoceptor was both time and concentration dependent. However, this up-regulation did not result in a substantial alteration in the cellular distribution profile of the receptor. Half-maximal up-regulation of the CAM beta2-adrenoceptor required concentrations of betaxolol similar to those needed to cause half-maximal inhibition of basal adenylyl cyclase activity, indicating the receptor up-regulation is associated with the inverse agonist properties of this compound. Despite the large up-regulation of CAM beta2-adrenoceptor levels, treatment with betaxolol did not significantly alter levels of the G protein that couples to this receptor (G(Salpha)). After sustained treatment with betaxolol, Northern analyses did not demonstrate up-regulation of either CAM beta2-adrenoceptor or G(Salpha) mRNA, and up-regulation of the receptor was prevented by cotreatment of the cells with cycloheximide. These data indicate that the up-regulation of the receptor by betaxolol is likely to reflect an increase in translational efficiency of existing mRNA and/or stabilization of the receptor polypeptide from proteolytic degradation and indicate that such effects can be produced by inverse agonists but not by neutral antagonists.", 
    "15": "This study was designed to examine the effects of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent on the ischemic response to dobutamine stress and to determine the degree to which these effects can be abolished by the addition of atropine.", 
    "16": "Whether beta-blockade affects the sensitivity of dobutamine stress echocardiography for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease has been controversial.", 
    "17": "In nine pigs, a left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis was created to reduce flow reserve (maximal/rest flow) to 1.1 to 1.9 without baseline regional wall motion abnormalities. This corresponded to a 50% to 90% diameter stenosis. Wall thickening was measured using epicardial echocardiography. Regional lactate production and coronary venous pH were monitored from an adjacent cardiac vein. A standard protocol of dobutamine stress echocardiography was first performed. After normalization of the ischemic abnormalities elicited with this infusion, esmolol was infused at 50 micrograms/kg body weight per min and the dobutamine test was repeated, with 1.0 mg of atropine added at the maximal dobutamine dose.", 
    "18": "Without esmolol, dobutamine stress induced myocardial ischemia with a reduction in regional wall thickening and lactate production in all nine pigs. Multiple regression analysis revealed that coronary flow per heartbeat (p < 0.01) and lactate production (p < 0.05) independently correlated with regional wall thickening during dobutamine stress. The beta-blocker significantly reduced heart rate and regional oxygen consumption and altered the relation between coronary flow per heartbeat and regional wall thickening (p < 0.05) during dobutamine stress. Esmolol prevented dobutamine-induced ischemia (lactate production and wall motion abnormalities) in seven of nine pigs. The addition of atropine induced lactate production and a reduction in wall thickening in five of seven pigs in which ischemia had been prevented by beta-blockade. However, lactate production was higher and regional venous pH was lower with the baseline dobutamine infusion than with that performed after esmolol with atropine added at the maximal dobutamine dose (p < 0.05).", 
    "19": "A correlation between regional wall thickening and coronary flow per heartbeat was demonstrated during baseline dobutamine stress. Beta-blockade shifted this relation so that dobutamine stress-induced myocardial ischemia was attenuated. The mechanisms by which beta-blockade prevents dobutamine-induced ischemia appeared to be mainly through decreases in heart rate and rate of rise in left ventricular pressure, improvement of regional coronary flow per heartbeat and attenuation of regional ischemic lactate production. Adding atropine in conventional doses enhanced the ability of dobutamine stress to induce myocardial ischemia but did not completely abolish the effects of beta-blockade on either the severity of dobutamine-induced wall thickening abnormalities or regional metabolic disturbances.", 
    "20": "The class III antiarrhythmics azimilide dihydrochloride and dl-sotalol were evaluated for ability to suppress induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT) in anesthetized, male mongrel dogs 4-6 days after surgical infarction of the left ventricle (LV) produced by ligation/reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Postmortem infarcts averaged 28.2 +/- 3.3% and 27.5 +/- 3.9% of the LV for azimilide- and sotalol-treated dogs, respectively. Both agents (0.3-30 mg/kg i.v.) increased ventricular effective refractory period as a function of dose in LV normal and infarcted zones without increasing conduction time. Azimilide was well tolerated hemodynamically up to 30 mg/kg i.v., whereas sotalol produced a significant and dose-related decrease in both blood pressure and heart rate. Azimilide was effective in five (56%) of nine dogs in preventing induction of ventricular arrhythmias by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) at doses from 1 to 30 mg/kg. Efficacy was seen for nonsustained and sustained VT and for ventricular fibrillation. Although sotalol (0.3-10 mg/kg) was effective in all five VT dogs tested, one of two nonsustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia (NSVT) dogs and two of three sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia (SVT) dogs were reinducible with the baseline arrhythmia at doses higher than the effective dose, and one dog died after 30 mg/kg of sotalol. Both agents increased the cycle length of VT. Thus azimilide simultaneously increased refractoriness and provided antiarrhythmic efficacy as suppression of PES-induced ventricular arrhythmias in infarcted dogs without the hemodynamic depression seen with sotalol.", 
    "21": "This work (a) provides evidence for hysteresis in the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) in the conscious dog; (b) studies the main stimulation parameters that may affect this phenomenon; and (c) evaluates the influence of the autonomic nervous system. AERP was measured by the extrastimulus method in the conscious dog with chronic atrioventricular block (n = 6) during the increasing and decreasing phases of an S1S2 fixed protocol. AERP was longer during the increasing phase than during the decreasing phase, thus demonstrating hysteresis, calculated as the difference between the two values. Hysteresis was greater with an S1S1 basic cycle length of 300 ms than with a basic cycle length of 400 ms, 9 +/- 0.9, and 7 +/- 0.9 ms, respectively. It was also greater with trains of six basic cycles before each extrastimulus S2 than with trains of 12 basic cycles, 9 +/- 0.9 and 7 +/- 1.0 ms, respectively. Suppression of vagal tone with atropine reduced hysteresis from 8 +/- 0.6 to 4 +/- 0.6 ms, whereas suppression of cardioaccelerator tone with propranolol increased it from 9 +/- 0.9 to 14 +/- 1.2 ms. These data were confirmed by the neostigmine-induced increase in hysteresis from 8 +/- 0.8 to 11 +/- 0.8 ms and the isoproterenol-induced decrease in hysteresis from 9 +/- 0.6 to 4 +/- 0.4 ms. Overall, these results provide evidence for a hysteresis effect in the AERP in the conscious dog that is stimulation frequency-dependent and modulated by the autonomic nervous system with permanent increase by vagal tone and decrease by cardioaccelerator tone.", 
    "22": "In hypertensives, a reduced coronary flow reserve is observed and may contribute to angina pectoris and silent (painless) myocardial ischemia, which frequently occur in these patients even in the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD). To assess the frequency of ischemia-type ST-segment depressions in these patients and the influence of heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) as major determinants of myocardial oxygen demand and to test the effects of beta-blocker therapy (10-20 mg betaxolol/day for 4 weeks) on these variables, simultaneous 24-h Holter and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring was performed in 19 patients with hypertension (age, 43-71 years; nine women, 10 men) without CAD (stenosis < 50% in angiography). Before treatment, 25 periods of significant ST-segment depressions with a total duration of 470 min were observed in nine patients. ST-segment depressions were significantly correlated with preceding increases in HR and the rate-pressure product. The majority (79%) of episodes with ST-segment depression were clinically painless. In this open study, beta-blockade significantly decreased the number of episodes with ST-segment depressions to six in four of 15 patients and the total duration to 38 min (p < 0.05). The data demonstrate that HR seems to be associated with the development of ischemic ST-segment deviations in patients with hypertension without CAD. Antihypertensive therapy in these patients should target not only sufficient BP control, but also reduction of ischemic events.", 
    "23": "The clinical importance of selection of different antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of diabetic patients is still unclear. Thus we performed a randomised, controlled study in 105 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients with microalbuminuria over 1 year. Patients received either the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril (2.5-5.0 mg/day; in addition 24% of patients also received felodipine) or the beta blocking agent atenolol (50-100 mg/day; in addition 24% of patients also received hydrochlorothiazide). Blood pressure, metabolic control, lipid levels and albumin excretion rate were studied during the follow-up. After 1 year an almost identical fall (p < 0.001) in blood pressure was observed with ramipril (170/100 vs 150/ 85 mmHg, median) and atenolol (180/100 vs 150/ 80 mmHg, median). With ramipril a reduction of total cholesterol (6.3 vs 5.9 mmol/l), of LDL cholesterol (3.8 vs 3.6 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol (1.3 vs 1.2 mmol/l) was found, whereas triglycerides slightly increased (1.8 vs 2.0 mmol/l). With atenolol a similar reduction of total cholesterol (6.3 vs 5.9 mmol/l), LDL cholesterol (3.8 vs 3.7 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol (1.4 vs 1.2 mmol/l) and an increase of triglycerides (1.4 vs 1.7 mmol/l) was noted. Metabolic control of the patients was maintained with both ramipril and atenolol treatment. With ramipril treatment urinary albumin creatinine ratio (14.4 vs 13.8 mg/mmol) and creatinine clearance (82 vs 84 ml/min) were constant, but with atenolol an increase of albumin creatinine ratio (13.9 vs 19 mg/mmol, p < 0.001) and a slight decrease of creatinine clearance (80 vs 66 ml/min, p < 0.05, not significant after Bonferroni correction) was observed.", 
    "24": "1-year treatment of NIDDM patients with ramipril or atenolol does not influence metabolic control, the changes in serum lipids were similar. Despite almost identical blood pressure reduction in both groups the albumin creatinine ratio was constant under ramipril, but increased under atenolol treatment.", 
    "25": "We report the efficacy of therapy over 5 years follow-up in 758 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients in a prospective, randomised controlled study of therapy of mild hypertension. Patients were recruited who on antihypertensive therapy had systolic blood pressure over 150 mmHg or diastolic over 85 mmHg, or if not on therapy had systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg or diastolic over 90 mmHg. Their mean blood pressure at entry to the study was 160/94 mmHg at a mean age of 57 years. They were allocated to tight control (aiming for systolic < 150/diastolic < 85 mmHg) or to less tight control (aiming for systolic < 180/diastolic < 105 mmHg). The tight control group were allocated to primary therapy either with a beta blocker (atenolol) or with an antiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), with addition of other agents as required. Over 5 years, the mean blood pressure in the tight control group was significantly lower (143/82 vs 154/88 mmHg, p < 0.001). No difference was seen between those allocated to atenolol or captopril. The proportion of patients requiring three or more antihypertensive therapies to maintain tight control in those allocated to atenolol or captopril increased from 16 and 15%, respectively at 2 years to 25 and 26%, respectively at 5 years, whereas in the less tight control group at 2 and 5 years only 5 and 7%, respectively required three or more therapies. There was no difference in the incidence of side effects or hypoglycaemic episodes between those allocated to atenolol or captopril, but those allocated to atenolol increased their body weight by a mean of 2.3 kg compared with 0.5 kg in those allocated to captopril (p < 0.01). Allocation to atenolol was also associated with small increases in triglyceride, and decreases in LDL and HDL cholesterol, which are of uncertain clinical relevance. The study is continuing to determine whether the improved blood pressure control, which was obtained, will be beneficial in maintaining the health of patients by decreasing the incidence of major clinical complications, principally myocardial infarction and strokes, and microvascular complications, such as severe retinopathy requiring photocoagulation and deterioration of renal function.", 
    "26": "Anginal symptoms alone are not a reliable guide to the extent of patients' ischaemic heart disease and silent episodes of ischaemia are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is becoming apparent that effective treatment of ischaemia will have to target the pattern of ischaemic events seen in patients' daily lives and treatment strategies are now being developed which aim to eliminate both silent and symptomatic episodes of ischaemia over the whole 24-h period. For example, the Circadian Anti-ischaemia Program in Europe (CAPE) trial has shown that significant improvements in objective and subjective measures of ischaemia occurred over 24 h when the once-daily third-generation dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine was added to background medical therapy. In addition, the Canadian Amlodipine/Atenolol in Silent Ischaemia Study (CASIS) has clearly shown the complementary effects of combination therapy with amlodipine and the long-acting beta-blocker atenolol. Ongoing and future outcome studies will determine the impact of such approaches on the prognosis for patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "27": "Approximately 20% of patients undergoing diagnostic coronary arteriography for acute or chronic cardiac ischaemia have angiographically normal coronary arteries. The mechanism behind this phenomenon is likely to be the result of a combination of functional or anatomical abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation, a metabolic disorder which affects the handling of energy substrates by the heart, insulin resistance and a neurological component affecting pain perception. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that these patients often exhibit an increase in sympathetic outflow to the cardiovascular system, which might account for the reduction in coronary flow reserve, changes in metabolic utilization and development of insulin resistance that are seen in some of these patients. Therapeutically, beta-blockers appear to be most effective in controlling the symptoms associated with this condition, although those calcium antagonists which do not affect the neurohormonal system may be of some utility in patients with primary microvascular angina, in which microvascular spasm is operating or in whom excessive constriction of the distal component of the coronary circulation limits the vasodilatory reserve.", 
    "28": "Angina with left ventricular dysfunction exhibits a wide range of different presentations. Approximately 45% of patients referred for coronary artery bypass surgery have some degree of left ventricular dysfunction and, given that at least a third of those suffering from angina have a history of myocardial infarction, the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction in such patients is likely to be substantial. The major prognostic factor in patients with coronary artery disease is the degree of left ventricular function and it is important to identify those with poor or reduced left ventricular function. High-risk patients, defined by exercise testing and echocardiography, should be considered for revascularization. For the majority of patients management should be medical, consisting of nitrates plus a beta-blocker or calcium antagonist. In severe ischaemia, the combination of these agents has been shown to provide additional efficacy. In patients with heart failure the newer calcium antagonist amlodipine has been shown to have a neutral effect upon survival, indicating that it may be used safely in patients with angina and left ventricular dysfunction. Progression of left ventricular dysfunction may be slowed through the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which have also been shown to improve survival, although they should be used with caution, since there is evidence that ACE inhibitors may worsen angina in some patients.", 
    "29": "The majority of post-myocardial infarction studies with beta-blocking drugs involved earlier generations. Newer drugs of this family with additional vasodilating and free-radical suppression properties, such as carvediol, are now available which may improve the prognosis still further. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was designed to assess the extent of myocardial ischaemia in clinically stable patients 6 weeks after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolysis, and to determine the influence of carvedilol on ischaemic events during the subsequent 6 months. One hundred and one patients who remained event free at 6 weeks post myocardial infarction underwent rest and exercise thallium-201 (TI-201) imaging. Reversible ischaemia was detected in 70 of the patients and there were 13 events in this group compared to one event in the 31 patients without ischaemia (P = 0.07). Four of the 56 patients on carvedilol and 10 of the 45 on placebo had adverse cardiac events (P = 0.04). In patients with reversible ischaemia carvedilol was more effective in reducing these events than was placebo (P = 0.03). These studies demonstrate that reversible myocardial ischaemia detected by TI-201 imaging is present in a large proportion of clinically stable patients following thrombolysis. In these patients, there is an increased cardiac event rate which is significantly reduced by carvedilol.", 
    "30": "Dobutamine-atropine stress echocardiography is an efficient method in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease. However, because high-dose dobutamine is potentially arrhythmogenic, the safety of this stress modality has been questioned.", 
    "31": "We performed a 24 h Holter monitoring, before and immediately after this test, in 73 consecutive patients (60 men and 13 women), mean age 60 +/- 12 years. Twenty-eight patients had had a recent myocardial infarction, 25 had stable chronic angina, 10 chronic ischaemic cardiomyopathy and 10 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dobutamine was progressively increased (5-40 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and atropine was injected in 30 patients. Arrhythmias and ST-segment deviation before and after the stress test were evaluated.", 
    "32": "The mean peak dobutamine dose was 32 +/- 11 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. The heart rate at rest and at peak dose was, respectively, 69 +/- 16 and 110 +/- 28 beats.min-1. Side effects during the injection of dobutamine were mainly ventricular (n = 14) or atrial (n = 4) premature contractions. Three patients had non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and five had hypotension during the test. No sustained episode of supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia was observed during the study. Non-sustained supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias were detected in 8 and 21 patients before and in 11 and 16 patients after dobutamine stress echocardiography (P = ns). Asymptomatic ST-segment deviation was observed in two patients before and four after dobutamine stress echocardiography. An increase in total ischaemic time (20 vs 102 mn) was observed after the test, but only five patients had ST modifications. A separate analysis of patients with and without beta-blocker did not alter these results. In addition, when the occurrence of significant arrhythmias was stratified according to a left ventricular ejection fraction threshold of 45%, we observed no difference in frequency and severity of cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "33": "This study demonstrates that dobutamine stress echocardiography does not significantly increase arrhythmia during the following 24 h. Further studies are required to evaluate the influence of the test on ST-segment modification during the same period.",

    "39": "Clinical variables associated with the decision to initiate angiography were young age, male gender, progression of angina, multiple pain episodes and use of beta-blocker or calcium antagonists before admission, abnormal ST-T segment on baseline ECG, recurrent pain in hospital, and ECG changes during pain. These associations did not differ between hospitals. Nevertheless, angiography was performed more often in the presence of angiography facilities (university hospital), independent of the variable case-mix. Survival and infarct-free survival were similar in both hospitals, 96% and 90% respectively.",

We present a case of refractory anaphylactoid shock during coronary angiography unresponsive to aggressive standard therapy in a patient on beta-blockers. Significant clinical improvement was noted upon administration of glucagon. Since beta-blockers are commonly used in patients with coronary artery disease, this potentially life-threatening complication has to be kept in mind with any procedure involving contrast media in patients on beta-blockers. Immediate access to glucagon by keeping it in the procedure room may be lifesaving in these situations.", 
    "42": "Antimalarial drugs are well known for their cardiovascular toxicity. Quinine, the most famous antimalarial agent, mostly causes bradycardia. Quinidine, its dextrorotatory isomer, may cause 1:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction during atrial flutter. The newly developed drug mefloquine was reported to have fewer cardiac side effects. We describe a 63-year-old male patient with atrial flutter in whom mefloquine use was associated with 1:1 AV conduction, and who then responded to therapy with digoxin and sotalol. The patient had a history of palpitations. This case report emphasizes that mefloquine should be used with caution in patients with a history of palpitations or underlying heart disease.", 
    "43": "We have previously shown that infarction impairs recovery of global function after subsequent cardioplegic arrest and that therapy with orotic acid improves recovery. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of infarction on regional and global left ventricular function and to determine whether orotic acid exerts a beneficial effect exclusive of the effects of cardioplegia.", 
    "44": "Acute myocardial infarction was produced in dogs. They then received either orotic acid or placebo (control) orally (n = 12 per group). Fractional radial shortening and systolic wall thickening were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography before and 1 and 3 days after infarction with and without beta-adrenergic blockade, and in 6 dogs up to 9 days after infarction. Global function was measured under anesthesia 4 days after infarction.", 
    "45": "In control animals, fractional radial shortening in the infarct decreased from 20.6% +/- 5.1% before infarction to 3.0% +/- 2.2% at day 1 and to 1.9% at day 3 (p < 0.01). In the border zone radial shortening declined from 21.9% +/- 3.7% to 11.0% +/- 2.3% at day 1 and 9.3% +/- 2.8% at day 3 (p < 0.05). In the noninfarcted myocardium radial shortening also declined from 27.1% +/- 1.9% before infarction to 18.3% +/- 2.3% on day 1 (p < 0.05) and to 16.0% +/- 2.8% on day 3 after infarction (p < 0.05) with recovery to preinfarct levels by 9 days after infarction. These findings were confirmed by measurements of systolic thickening. Before infarction beta-receptor blockade decreased fractional shortening in all regions of the left ventricle, but this effect was absent on day 3 after infarction, implying that the myocardium had become less responsive to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Measurements of global function 4 days after infarction showed marked depression of stroke work. There was no effect of orotic acid treatment on regional or global function.", 
    "46": "Myocardial infarction causes reversible depression of resting function and beta-adrenergic responsiveness in the remote and border zone areas, which is not prevented by metabolic therapy with orotic acid. This finding may explain the adverse response of the infarcted heart to cardioplegic arrest.",

    "48": "Nine patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and six patients with ocular hypertension were enrolled for this study. All patients were treated topically with 0.5% timolol or 0.005% latanoprost, using a double-masked crossover design with a 3-week washout before administration of each drug. Each patient had a baseline color Doppler imaging ultrasound of the central retinal artery, short posterior ciliary arteries, and ophthalmic artery and two other ultrasound examinations during the 1-week treatment with each drug, performed 12 hours after the first dose of the drug and 12 hours after the last dose, 7 days later.", 
    "49": "Both topical timolol and topical latanoprost significantly reduced the intraocular pressure. The only significant change observed in the retrobulbar blood velocity with timolol was a reduction of end diastolic velocity in the ophthalmic artery 12 hours after the first dose, accompanied by a trend toward a decrease in the peak systolic velocity and an increase in the resistance index in the same vessel. No change in blood velocity was observed with latanoprost.", 
    "50": "Topical timolol and latanoprost significantly reduced the intraocular pressure in ocular hypertensive and glaucoma patients without creating substantial hemodynamic changes in the retrobulbar vessels.",

    "52": "Included in this study were patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma who were followed for 3 years or longer and were treated, through either medical or surgical therapy, by adjusting intraocular pressure to 18 mm Hg or less as a therapeutic end point. We studied 31 matched pairs of patients in which one member was treated by surgery and one member had medical treatment. In every pair, we matched each patient individually by age, race, and intraocular pressure.", 
    "53": "For the matched pairs of patients in this study, the mean intraocular pressure following initiation of treatment was 13.5 and 13.1 mm Hg for the surgically and medically treated groups, respectively (P = .475). This study found no difference between groups in the incidence of glaucomatous progression following surgical (n = 3) or medical (n = 3) therapy (P > .99, McNemar's test) for an average follow-up of 40.0 +/- 10.0 and 43.4 +/- 8.4 months in the medical and surgical groups respectively. The glaucoma of three patients progressed on the basis of reduced visual acuity, two by visual field, and one by disk hemorrhage. Although the types of complications from therapy differed between groups, no vision loss or life-threatening events occurred directly from these treatments.",

    "55": "To assess cardiac function and exercise tolerance in patients receiving long term TSH-suppressive therapy with levothyroxine (L-T4), we studied maximal exercise capacity with a bicycle ergometer and left ventricular function at rest and during physical exercise by radionuclide angiography. The evaluation was performed in 10 patients receiving L-T4 therapy (2.31 +/- 0.13 microgram/kg) for 5-9 yr, presenting with effort dyspnea and symptoms of adrenergic overactivity, and 10 matched control subjects. The patients were reassessed after 4 months of administration of the selective beta-adrenergic blocker bisoprolol (4.25 +/- 0.4 mg/day); L-T4 therapy remained unchanged. The results showed that at rest, left ventricular diastolic filling was impaired in the patients (P < 0.05), whereas systolic function was unaltered. During submaximal physical exercise, left ventricular ejection fraction increased in the controls from 58 +/- 2% to 65 +/- 2% (P < 0.001), whereas in the patients it fell from 63 +/- 2% to 53 +/- 2% (P < 0.01), mainly because of increased end-systolic left ventricular volume (P < 0.05). Exercise capacity was markedly reduced in the patients in terms of both peak workload (P < 0.001) and exercise duration (P < 0.001). beta-Adrenergic blockade prevented both the fall in ejection fraction and the increase in end-systolic volume during exercise, and improved exercise tolerance. In conclusion, our data show that long term TSH-suppressive therapy with L-T4 is not as harmless as believed, because it may cause marked impairment of cardiac functional reserve and physical exercise capacity. Administration of a beta-blocking drug for 4 months caused significant improvement of cardiac performance and exercise tolerance.", 
    "56": "A rapid and feasible chromatographic method for determining atenolol, metoprolol, alprenolol, oxprenolol, acebutolol and propranolol by non-suppressed ion chromatography is proposed. The mobile phase consisted of 50 mM nitric acid in an aqueous solution of 4% (v/v) acetonitrile. Detection limits are in the range 0.1-2.7 mg l-1. The method was successfully applied to the determination of beta-blockers in several pharmaceutical formulations.", 
    "57": "The cumulative evidence acquired over 20 years suggests that beta-blockers improve functional capacity, ventricular function, and decrease mortality in patients with heart failure either due to dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease. This effect is independent of the beneficial effects of digoxin, diuretics and particularly ACE inhibitors and has resulted in re-evaluation of requirements for transplantation in patients with advanced cardiac failure. Ninety percent of patients appear to respond to beta-blockers but no clinical or biochemical parameters can identify a favourable response. The beneficial effects occur slowly but last for years. Further ongoing trials will provide more information but beta-blockade therapy should be considered in addition to other therapy in the management of heart failure.",

The purpose of this study was to establish whether patients treated with timolol maleate for primary open-angle glaucoma should be reviewed at a specific time of day, within normal clinical hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). It is normal practice to schedule review appointments into either morning or afternoon clinic sessions. This may result in abnormally high intraocular pressure values being missed.",

    "68": "The basic pharmacology of the third-generation beta-blocking agent carvedilol differs considerably from second-generation compounds such as metoprolol. Moreover, carvedilol may produce different, ie, more favorable, clinical effects in chronic heart failure. For these reasons, we compared the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on adrenergic activity, receptor expression, degree of clinical beta-blockade, hemodynamics, and left ventricular function in patients with mild or moderate chronic heart failure.", 
    "69": "The effects of carvedilol versus metoprolol were compared in two concurrent placebo-controlled trials with carvedilol or metoprolol that had common substudies focused on adrenergic, hemodynamic, and left ventricular functional measurements. All subjects in the substudies had chronic heart failure resulting from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Carvedilol at 50 to 100 mg/d produced reductions in exercise heart rate that were similar to metoprolol at 125 to 150 mg/d, indicating comparable degrees of beta-blockade. Compared with metoprolol, carvedilol was associated with greater improvement in New York Heart Association functional class. Although there were no significant differences in hemodynamic effects between the carvedilol and metoprolol active-treatment groups, carvedilol tended to produce relatively greater improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and stroke work compared with changes in the respective placebo groups. Carvedilol selectively lowered coronary sinus norepinephrine levels, an index of cardiac adrenergic activity, whereas metoprolol did not lower coronary sinus norepinephrine and actually increased central venous norepinephrine levels. Finally, metoprolol was associated with an increase in cardiac beta-receptor density, whereas carvedilol did not change cardiac beta-receptor expression.", 
    "70": "The third-generation beta-blocking agent carvedilol has substantially different effects on left ventricular function, hemodynamics, adrenergic activity, and beta-receptor expression than dose the second-generation compound metoprolol.

After a 2- to 4-week up-titration period, subjects remained on study medication for a period of 6 months. The primary efficacy parameter was submaximal exercise measured by two different techniques, the 6-minute corridor walk test and the 9-minute self-powered treadmill test. Carvedilol had no detectable effect on submaximal exercise as measured by either technique. However, carvedilol was associated with dose-related improvements in LV function (by 5, 6, and 8 ejection fraction [EF] units in the low-, medium-, and high-dose carvedilol groups, respectively, compared with 2 EF units with placebo, P < .001 for linear dose response) and survival (respective crude mortality rates of 6.0%, 6.7%, and 1.1% with increasing doses of carvedilol compared with 15.5% in the placebo group, P < .001). When the three carvedilol groups were combined, the all-cause actuarial mortality risk was lowered by 73% in carvedilol-treated subjects (P < .001).

The primary end point was clinical progression, defined as death due to heart failure, hospitalization for heart failure, or a sustained increase in heart failure medications. Clinical progression of heart failure occurred in 21% of placebo patients and 11% of carvedilol patients, reflecting a 48% (P = .008) reduction in the primary end point of heart failure progression (relative risk, 0.52; CI, 0.32 to 0.85). This effect of carvedilol was not influenced by sex, age, race, cause of heart failure, or baseline LVEF. Carvedilol also significantly improved several secondary end points, including LVEF, heart failure score, NYHA functional class, and the physician and patient global assessments. Carvedilol reduced all-cause mortality but had no effects on the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure scale, the distance walked in 9 minutes on a self-powered treadmill, or cardiothoracic index.

Compared with placebo, patients in the carvedilol group had a greater frequency of symptomatic improvement and lower risk of clinical deterioration, as evaluated by changes in the NYHA functional class (P = .014) or by a global assessment of progress judged either by the patient (P = .002) or by the physician (P < .001). In addition, treatment with carvedilol was associated with a significant increase in ejection fraction (P < .001) and a significant decrease in the combined risk of morbidity and mortality (P = .029). In contrast, carvedilol therapy had little effect on indirect measures of patient benefit, including changes in exercise tolerance or quality-of-life scores. The effects of the drug were similar in patients with ischemic heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy as the cause of heart failure.",

    "80": "We previously demonstrated that in white fat cell precursors alpha2-adrenoceptor stimulation lead to the phosphorylation of p44 and p42 mitogen-activated protein kinases and an increase in cell number. Regulation of cell adhesion and cell cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the control of cell growth by various growth factors. Here, we report that in mouse 3T3F442A preadipocytes expressing 2500 fmol/mg protein of the human alpha2C10-adrenoceptor (alpha2AF2 cells), alpha2-adrenergic stimulation rapidly restored the spreading of cells previously retracted by serum withdrawal. This effect was pertussis toxin sensitive and was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with dihydrocytochalasin B (a blocker of actin polymerization), genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), or agents that increase cell cAMP content. Spreading was accompanied by cell membrane ruffling, formation of lamelipodia and filipodia, appearance of focal adhesion plaques, and induction of actin stress fibers. alpha2-Adrenergic stimulation also lead to a rapid Gi- and actin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the pp125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as well as of the p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases. alpha2-Adrenergic-dependent spreading and FAK and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation were also observed in 3T3F442A preadipocytes permanently expressing 20 fmol/mg protein of the human alpha2C10-adrenoceptor (alpha2AF3 cells) as well as in BFC-1beta preadipocytes, which constitutively express 25 fmol/mg protein of mouse alpha2A-adrenoceptors. In BFC-1beta preadipocytes, alpha2-adrenergic-dependent spreading and pp125FAK phosphorylation were counteracted by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Our results suggest that alpha2-adrenergic control of actin polymerization and focal adhesion assembly could play a crucial role in the regulation of preadipocyte growth by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "81": "The anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG7142 increases dopamine turnover in rodent prefrontal cortex but not in other dopamine terminal field areas. FG7142-induced increases in prefrontal cortical dopamine receptor stimulation impair prefrontal-dependent, but not nonprefrontal-dependent, cognitive tasks in rats and monkeys. The degree of impairment correlates with levels of prefrontal cortical dopamine turnover in rats and can be blocked in rats and monkeys with dopamine receptor antagonists, suggesting that increased dopamine turnover is directly related to the cognitive deficits. The current study examined nondopaminergic drug effects on FG7142-perturbed biochemistry and cognition. Both the noradrenergic alpha-2 agonist clonidine and the glycine/NMDA antagonist (+)HA966 prevented the FG7142-induced increase in dopamine turnover in rodent prefrontal cortex. Infusion of (+)HA966 into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) also blocked this increase in dopamine turnover, indicating that critical modulatory effects of (+)HA966 on FG7142-induced changes in dopamine turnover are occurring at the level of mesoprefrontal dopamine neuron cell bodies. Systemic (+)HA966 and clonidine, but not propranolol or D-cycloserine, prevented FG7142-associated spatial working memory deficits in rats and monkeys. These results support the idea of a critical range of dopamine turnover for optimal prefrontal cortical cognitive functioning, with excessive dopamine turnover leading to cognitive impairment. These studies also provide evidence for the regulation of prefrontal cortical dopamine turnover and cognition by multiple neurotransmitter systems and suggest that the VTA is an important regulatory site for these effects.", 
    "82": "Leptin, a recently identified hormone, is believed to reduce appetite and maintain body weight. The mRNA of leptin is expressed only in mature adipose cells. To clarify the regulation of leptin gene expression in adipocytes, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 16 h with various agents known to modulate lipid metabolism, and then the leptin mRNA was measured by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method. Interestingly, both norepinephrine and isoproterenol reduced the level of leptin mRNA to about 20% of that found in untreated control cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The maximum reduction occurred at 100 nmol/l of either norepinephrine or isoproterenol, and the half-maximal effect was observed at approximately 3 nmol/l norepinephrine and approximately 1 nmol/l isoproterenol. Propranolol reversed about 50% of the reduction by either norepinephrine or isoproterenol. In contrast, phentolamine did not inhibit the reduction by either norepinephrine or isoproterenol. Moreover, both cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP decreased the level of leptin mRNA to about 10% of that in control cells in a dose-dependent fashion. The maximum effect was elicited at 100 ng/ml cholera toxin and 100 micromol/l dibutyryl cAMP. The concentration producing the half-maximal effect was approximately 1 ng/ml cholera toxin and approximately 50 micromol/l dibutyryl cAMP. Dibutyryl cGMP, however, did not affect leptin gene expression. These results suggest that a signaling pathway that results in the activation of protein kinase A regulates leptin gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.", 
    "83": "A macroscopic low-voltage-activated (LVA) inward current was found in pancreatic beta-cells isolated from NOD mice. However, this current was not present in nondiabetic prone mouse (e.g., Swiss-Webster) pancreatic beta-cells. We performed pharmacological analyses on this current in NOD insulinoma tumor cells (NIT-1). This cell line was developed from pancreatic beta-cells of a transgenic NOD mouse. The sodium-channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX; 2 micromol/l) had no effect on this LVA current. The amplitudes of currents elicited by a -20 mV test pulse retained similarity when the extracellular sodium concentration was increased from 0 to 115 mmol/l; when the extracellular calcium concentration was decreased from 10 to 2 mmol/l, there was an approximate 50% reduction of this current elicited by a -30 mV test pulse. Neither the L-type calcium-channel blocker, nifedipine (3 micromol/l), nor the N-type calcium-channel blocker, omega-CgTx-GVIA (1 micromol/l), at -30 mV produced an appreciable effect. The T-type calcium-channel blockers, nickel (3 micromol/l) and amiloride (250 micromol/l), effectively reduced the peak of this current. In 2 mmol/l calcium external solution, the threshold of voltage-dependent activation of this calcium current was approximately -65 mV, and the peak current occurred at -20 mV. Half-maximum steady-state inactivation was around -43 mV. The mean time constant of slow deactivating tail currents generated by a preceding 20 mV pulse was 2.53 ms. The intracellular free calcium concentration was two- to threefold higher in NOD mouse pancreatic beta-cells compared with Swiss-Webster pancreatic beta-cells. We concluded that there are LVA calcium channels abnormally expressed in NOD mouse beta-cells. This LVA calcium channel may be factorial to the high cytosolic free calcium concentration observed in these cells, and thereby may contribute to the pathogenesis of NOD mouse beta-cells.", 
    "84": "To clarify the mechanism of Ca2+ involvement in the DNA transfer through cell membrane, we studied the effects of Ca2+-chelator, Ca2+-ionophore, and Ca2+-channel blocker on the protoplast transfection of Lactobacillus casei ATCC 27092 by PL-1 phage DNA in the presence of Ca2+. Ca2+-chelators, citrate, EDTA, and dipicolinic acid, inhibited the transfection probably by compensating the effect of Ca2+. Ca2+-ionophores, A23187 and N,N,N', N'-tetracyclohexyl-3-oxapentanediamide, which were expected to accelerate transfection by introducing Ca2+ into cells, inhibited the transfection. This fact indicated the absence of correlation between the entry of Ca2+ and the transport of DNA into protoplasts. Verapamil, which blocks voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel besides beta-adrenergic receptor, inhibited the transfection with little effect on the survival of the protoplasts. Both flunarizine and vinpocetine, voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel blockers, did not show the selective toxicity. D-alpha-Aminoadipic acid, a glutamate receptor-operated Ca2+-channel blocker, had no effect. Propranolol, which blocks beta-adrenergic receptor as does verapamil, inhibited the transfection without severely damaging the protoplasts. These results suggested that a kind of receptor-operated Ca2+-channel was involved in the transport of PL-1 phage DNA into the cells and that the cell membrane might have a receptor structure somewhat similar to the beta-adrenergic receptor found in mammalian cells.", 
    "85": "In this study, we have investigated the release of immunoreactive interleukin-1 beta (irIL-1 beta) from the rat hypothalamus in vitro. It was found that (1) tissue explants release sizable amounts of irIL-1 beta (ranging from 0.43 to 0.52 pg/mg of wet tissue) in 20 min incubations; (2) basal release in significantly increased by depolarization induced with 56 mM KCl; (3) K(+)-induced irIL-1 beta release is inhibited by the specific blocker of N-type calcium channels, omega-conotoxin, and by verapamil, but not by nifedipine; (4) K(+)-induced release is also inhibited by the Na+ channel blockers tetrodotoxin and lidocaine; (5) irIL-1 beta release is significantly increased by noradrenalin; such increase is antagonized by verapamil and the beta-blocker propranolol, but not by the alpha-blocker phentolamine. The present evidence suggests that irIL-1 beta released by rat hypothalamic explants following KCl depolarization is neuronal in origin.", 
    "86": "We have investigated the presence of a cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent pathway in cerebrocortical nerve terminals and its role in the modulation of glutamate release. The activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin enhances intrasynaptosomal cAMP and induces Ca2+-dependent glutamate release. The membrane permeant analogue dibutyryl cAMP mimics this facilitatory effect, whereas the inactive compound 1,9-dideoxyforskolin is without effect. This cAMP-induced facilitation is consistent with the induction of spontaneous action potentials that are abolished by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin and by reducing nerve terminal excitability with arachidonic acid. We have also demonstrated that a beta-adrenergic receptor is linked to this pathway because isoproterenol increases cAMP levels and glutamate release, and both actions are antagonized by the receptor antagonist propanolol and the protein kinase A inhibitors H89 and 8-chloroadenosine 3',5'-monophosphorothioate ((Rp)-isomer). The finding that the increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration induced by synaptic activity reduces the concentration of agonist required to maximally activate adenylyl cyclase suggests that this enzyme may act as a coincidence detector, integrating glutamatergic neurotransmission and noradrenaline release.", 
    "87": "In vivo microdialysis in rat ventral hippocampus was used (i) to verify the importance of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the raphe as targets for drugs that enhance the citalopram-induced elevation of forebrain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and (ii) to further examine the specificity of (-)-penbutolol in this regard. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (s.c., or intra-raphe) or the mixed 5-HT1A/1B/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)-penbutolol (s.c.), potentiated the citalopram-induced 5-HT rise, whereas local \"reverse' dialysis of WAY100635 into the ventral hippocampus did not. Furthermore, the (-)-penbutolol-induced augmentation proved stereoselective and not mediated by beta-adrenoceptors (no effect of s.c. (+)-penbutolol, or beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blockers (betaxolol, ICI118.551)). These data provide direct evidence that increased stimulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the midbrain raphe impedes the effect of citalopram on forebrain extracellular 5-HT, whereas neither postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors nor beta-adrenoceptors appear to be involved.", 
    "88": "We have previously demonstrated that the facilitatory effect of the amygdala on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis responses to photic stimulation depends on the presence of norepinephrine (NE) in this region. In the present study we investigated the effect of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor blockers, injected into the central amygdala nucleus, on the HPA responses. In intact freely moving rats, short photic stimulation caused depletion of CRH-41 from the median eminence, due to its release into the portal circulation and a rise in serum ACTH and corticosterone levels. This effect was markedly inhibited by injection of prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker, but atenolol, a beta 1 blocker, had no effect. These data further indicate that amygdala NE plays a role in the activation of the HPA axis following neural stimuli and that this effect is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the central amygdala.", 
    "89": "The cardioprotective activity of propranolol is believed to be independent of its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic effect. Propranolol exerts this effect through a direct effect on the cardiac muscle, but the precise mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrated that propranolol binds to S100ao and S100L proteins with ED50 of approximately 1.0 microM without cation dependency and that this binding changes the conformation of these S100 proteins. Propranolol, however, was found to bind to and to change the conformation of S100C protein in the presence of Mg2+ or Zn2+ with ED50 of approximately 1.0 microM. No change was observed in the presence of Ca2+. Moreover, in the presence of Mg2+, the ED50 of L- and D- propranolol were approximately 0.8 and 2.0 microM, respectively. This study demonstrated for the first time, that the S100 proteins of the cardiac muscle are intracellular targets of propranolol, and that Mg2+ is a modulator of the cardioprotective activity of S100C protein.", 
    "90": "We have evaluated the effects of ligands with varying efficacies at beta-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A receptors in three in vivo models reflecting pre- and/or postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor activation. Forepaw treading in rats is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamin)tetralin)-induced discriminative stimulus is predominantly mediated by postsynaptic, but presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors might also be involved, and footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalization involves predominantly presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. In vitro receptor binding studies demonstrated high beta-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A receptor affinity of (-)-penbutolol, high beta-adrenoceptor and 60 times lower 5-HT1A receptor affinity of (+)-penbutolol, high beta-adrenoceptor affinity and about 100 times lower 5-HT1A receptor affinity of pindolol and (-)-tertatolol, only affinity for beta-adrenoceptors of metoprolol and ICI 118,551 (erythro-D,L-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylamine-b utan-2-ol, and only affinity for 5-HT1A receptors of WAY 100.635 ((N-[2-[4- (2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclo-hexane-carboxamide). (-)-Penbutolol, (-)-tertatolol, pindolol and WAY 100.635 antagonized 5-MeODMT-induced (5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) forepaw treading in rats, and (+)-penbutolol, ICI 118,551 and metoprolol were inactive. (-)-Penbutolol, WAY 100.635 and (-)-tertatolol antagonized 8-OH-DPAT-induced discriminative stimulus in rats, pindolol and metoprolol showed a mixed antagonistic and agonistic profile. Pindolol antagonized footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalization in rats, tertatolol inhibited maximum 36% and WAY 100.635, (-)-penbutolol, (+)-penbutolol, metroprolol and ICI 118,551 were inactive. (-)-Penbutolol and WAY 100.635 reversed 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of ultrasonic vocalization completely, (-)-tertatolol reversed maximum 52% and (+)-penbutolol and pindolol were inactive. It is concluded, that efficacies at 5-HT1A receptors can be estimated by applying a battery of in vivo test models that involve post- and presynaptic receptors to a variable degree. The in vivo ranking order of efficacy at 5-HT1A receptors was: WAY 100.635 = (-)-penbutolol < (-)-tertatolol < pindolol.", 
    "91": "Propranolol has been suggested to slow aortic aneurysm (AAA) expansion by a mechanism independent of simple blood pressure (BP) reduction. To investigate this hypothesis, we designed a series of experiments to examine the effects of hypertension and propranolol upon AAA expansion. Using an established animal model, we induced AAA in normotensive and genetically hypertensive rats by perfusion of the isolated infrarenal aorta with elastase for two hours. Systolic tail BP was monitored with a plethysmograph. AAA size was measured directly with a micrometer on postoperative days 7 and 14. All data are expressed as the mean +/- standard deviation (SD). BP (mmHg) was significantly higher in hypertensive rats: 164 +/- 15 versus 119 +/- 7 (p < 0.001). AAA were also significantly larger in hypertensive rats with a mean expansion rate (mm/day) nearly twice that of normotensive animals: 0.13 +/- 0.09 versus 0.07 +/- 0.03. In a second series of animals, propranolol treatment was compared to placebo. In those animals, hypertensive propranolol-treated rats had significantly smaller AAA than placebo-treated controls (p < 0.05). There was no difference in normotensive animals but these rats had an unexplained paradoxical rise in BP with treatment. In this model, hypertension increases the expansion rate of AAA. Propranolol reduced the size of AAA in hypertensive animals, at least in part because of a decrease in BP. Other possible mechanisms of propranolol's action may be operative and require further study.", 
    "92": "This study was undertaken to assess if the introduction of new angioplasty devices (autoperfusion balloon catheters, stent and atherectomy) could ameliorate early and late results of prompt percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in patients with refractory unstable angina. From January 1993 to June 1995, 59 of 278 patients (14 female, 45 male; mean age: 61 +/- 10 years; range: 38-78) admitted to our Coronary Care Unit with the diagnosis of unstable angina had more than one episode of chest pain at rest with dynamic electrocardiographic ST-T changes and without signs of cardiac necrosis while on medical therapy including oxygen, aspirin, heparin, nitroglycerin and either a beta-blocker or a calcium-antagonist. Coronary angiography was performed within 48 h from the last ischemic attack and a culprilesion technically suitable for PTCA was identified. PTCA was performed in 73 lesions. Elective stent implantation was considered for 16 type B or C lesions in 14 patients. The procedure was initially successful in 52/59 patients (88%), uncomplicated unsuccessful in 4/59 (7%) and complicated in 3/59 (5%). Elective stent insertions were all successful (16/16, 100%). All successfully treated patients were followed up for a mean of 12 +/- 7 months (range: 6-27): 2/52 patients (3.8%) suffered from non-transmural myocardial infarction, 14/52 (26.9%) had a recurrence of angina and 2/52 (3.8%), asymptomatic, had a positive stress test. We conclude that prompt PTCA in refractory unstable angina using 1990s 'state of the art' equipment compares favorably to previous study and that stent delivery might become the elective treatment of complex lesions in this subset of patients.", 
    "93": "The negative correlation between coronary heart disease and plasma levels of HDL has been attributed to the ability of HDL to take up cellular cholesterol. The HDL3-induced removal of cellular cholesterol was reported to be impaired in fibroblasts from patients with familial HDL deficiency (Tangier disease, TD). In addition, we have recently shown that HDL3 stimulates the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts. To investigate whether this cell signaling pathway is involved in cholesterol efflux mechanisms, we compared the HDL3-induced PC hydrolysis in normal fibroblasts and in fibroblasts from a TD kindred, in whom the HDL3- and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I)-induced mobilization of cellular cholesterol was found to be reduced by 50%. The HDL3-induced formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) via PC-specific phospholipase D (PC-PLD) was markedly reduced by 60-80% in these cells, whereas the formation of diacylglycerol (DG) via PC-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) was two- to threefold enhanced. Defective regulation of PC-PLC and PC-PLD was similarly observed in response to apo A-I and endothelin, but not in response to the receptor-independent stimulation of PC hydrolysis by PMA. A Tangier-like PA and DG formation pattern could be induced in normal cells after preincubation with pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a G-protein. The impaired mobilization of radiolabeled cellular cholesterol in TD cells could completely be overcome by increasing the PA levels in the presence of the PA phosphohydrolase inhibitor propranolol. Conversely, the inhibition of PA formation in the presence of 0.3% butanol as well as the inhibition of DG formation in the presence of the PC-PLC inhibitor D 609 reduced the mobilization of cellular cholesterol both in normal and in TD cells. Our data indicate that the coordinate formation of PA and DG via PC-PLD and PC-PLC is essential for efficient cholesterol efflux. The molecular defect in this TD kindred appears to affect an upstream effector of protein kinase C responsible for the G-protein-dependent regulation of PC-specific phospholipases.", 
    "94": "The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that women are more prone than men to develop torsade de pointes (TdP) in a defined cohort of patients exposed to the QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drug d,l-sotalol.", 
    "95": "In a database derived from 22 clinical trials involving 3135 adult patients who received oral d,l-sotalol (median follow-up, 164 days), TdP developed in 44 (1.9%) of 2336 men and in 33 (4.1%) of 799 women (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis identified female sex (P < .0001), presenting arrhythmia of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (P < .0001), history of congestive heart failure (P < .001), and d,l-sotalol dose > 320 mg/d (P < .001) as factors most predictive of TdP; in addition to these, a serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL in women and > 1.6 mg/dL in men was weakly predictive (P < .05). After adjustment for these risk factors, women had threefold greater odds of developing TdP than men. The sex difference in TdP risk was age independent and could not be explained by differential dose-related bradycardic responses in women versus men.", 
    "96": "Women are at increased risk of developing TdP during-administration of d,l-sotalol. This finding needs to be taken into account, together with other TdP risk factors, when patients are treated with this antiarrhythmic agent. Given the consistency between the present and other recent observations, greater caution in women regarding use of QT-prolonging drugs, in general, is advisable.", 
    "97": "The mechanism of the small beat-to-beat variations in cycle length of atrial flutter in humans has not been fully explained. We investigated the beat-to-beat control of atrial flutter cycle length using time and frequency analysis techniques.", 
    "98": "Mean, SD, and power spectra of atrial cycle lengths were calculated from atrial recordings in 28 patients with type I atrial flutter. In control patients, mean and SD values of atrial cycle length were 265 +/- 37 and 4.9 +/- 1.7 ms. Power spectra contained two or three major peaks with 10.6 +/- 9.2% in band 1 (0.0 to 0.18 Hz), 26.7 +/- 15.9% in band 2 (0.18 to 0.6 Hz), and 63.1 +/- 17.7% in band 3 (0.6 to 2.2 Hz). Isoproterenol infusion (n = 8) increased percentage of total power in band 1 (7.1 +/- 5.6% to 25.7 +/- 18.9%, P < .001). Percentage of total power in band 1 was less in patients receiving (n = 5) versus not receiving (n = 18) oral beta-blockers (2.2 +/- 1.9% versus 10.6 +/- 9.2%, P = .003). Standard deviation (2.5 +/- 1.3 versus 4.9 +/- 1.7 ms, P = .009) and total power (2025 +/- 1350 versus 9768 +/- 8874 ms2, P = .005) were less in heart transplant recipients (n = 5) than control patients. Increases in respiratory rate (n = 6) shifted band 2 frequency peak to higher frequencies (0.26 +/- 0.13 to 0.38 +/- 0.18 Hz, P < .05). Atrial cycle length was longer and monophasic action potential duration was shorter during inspiration than during expiration. Band 3 frequency peak was correlated with heart rate (r = .797, P < .0001).", 
    "99": "Atrial flutter cycle length variability has an underlying periodic pattern that is detected by spectral analysis. Atrial flutter is modulated on a beat-to-beat basis by an interplay between the autonomic nervous and respiratory systems and the ventricular rate.", 
    "100": "To explore the role of heart rate in the genesis of ventricular premature complexes whose incidence increases when the length of the preceding cardiac cycle decreases, we analyzed the effect of nadolol alone and together with atrial pacing in 4 patients. Nadolol lengthened the RR cycle and suppressed ventricular premature complexes; atrial pacing, restoring the baseline RR cycle lengths, led to the reappearance of ventricular premature complexes, suggesting the major role of heart rate.", 
    "101": "We studied the cardiac electrophysiological effects of propafenone and its 5-hydroxylated metabolite in conscious dogs. Sinus rate, corrected sinus recovery time and Wenckebach point were measured in 6 intact dogs. Atrial rate, ventricular rate and atrial effective refractory period were measured in 6 atrioventricular-blocked dogs. In both groups, we also determined blood pressure and plasma drug concentrations. Each dog received, with at least an 8-day interval, propafenone (hydrochloride) and 5-hydroxypropafenone (hydrochloride) in 4 successive intravenous injections, 30 min apart, at 0.5, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg kg(-1). Propafenone increased sinus rate and atrial rate more markedly than 5-hydroxypropafenone, and also transiently ventricular rate, whereas 5-hydroxypropafenone decreased it weakly. Propafenone shortened corrected sinus recovery time and increased Wenckebach point at the highest dose only, whereas 5-hydroxypropafenone did not modify corrected sinus recovery time and increased Wenckebach point less markedly than propafenone. Both drugs produced an identical atrial effective refractory period lengthening. Propafenone either increased mean blood pressure (in intact dogs) or decreased it (in atrioventricular-blocked dogs) at the highest dose only, whereas 5-hydroxypropafenone did not produce any effect on this parameter. Overall, these results show that propafenone and 5-hydroxypropafenone exhibit cardiac electrophysiological effects, reflecting (a) direct vagolytic action for both drugs associated with cardiodepressant effects for 5-hydroxypropafenone, and (b) marked atrial antiarrhythmic properties for 5-hydroxypropafenone probably involved in the therapeutic effect of propafenone.", 
    "102": "The effects of N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium cation (MPP+) and of an endogenously formed analog, 2,9-di-methyl-norharmanium cation (2,9-Me2NH+), on extracellular dopamine were studied in the striatum of freely moving rats. Perfusion of either 2,9-Me2NH+ or MPP+ through a microdialysis probe evoked a marked and dose-dependent increase of dopamine levels. Tetrodotoxin and Ca(2+)-free medium prevented the increase in dopamine levels induced by 2,9-Me2NH+, but not that induced by MPP+. Cocaine, 3 microM, intensified the 2,9-Me2 NH(+)-induced increase in extracellular dopamine and slightly attenuated the MPP(+)-induced efflux. S(-)-3-(3-Hydroxy-phenyl)-N-propylpiperidine, that acts as an antagonist of dopamine autoreceptors in the presence of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, markedly enhanced the increase in extracellular dopamine elicited by 2,9-Me2NH+, but not that by MPP+. These results suggested that 2,9-Me2NH+ was a potent dopamine reuptake blocker, whereas MPP+ acts as an amphetamine-like dopamine releaser rather than a reuptake inhibitor on the membrane transporter.", 
    "103": "This paper considers the appropriate role for government in the support of scientific and technological progress in health care; the information the federal government needs to make well-informed decisions about its role; and the ways that federal policy toward research and development should respond to scientific advances, technology trends, and changes in the political and social environment. The principal justification for government support of research rests upon economic characteristics that lead private markets to provide inappropriate levels of research support or to supply inappropriate quantities of the products that result from research. The federal government has two basic tools for dealing with these problems: direct subsidies for research and strengthened property rights that can increase the revenues that companies receive for the products that result from research. In the coming years, the delivery system for health care will continue to undergo dramatic changes, new research opportunities will emerge at a rapid pace, and the pressure to limit discretionary federal spending will intensify. These forces make it increasingly important to improve the measurement of the costs and benefits of research and to recognize the tradeoffs among alternative policies for promoting innovation in health care.", 
    "104": "Role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in noradrenergic neurotransmission has been mentioned as co-transmitter in both central and peripheral nervous system. Cerebral NPY content was changed by drugs influencing endogenous norepinephrine (NE) in rats. In an attempt to understand this mechanism, the present study was carried out using the radioimmunoassay of NPY. Values of NPY-like immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) were reduced in rats receiving the treatment of pargyline, the inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, with an elevation of catecholamine in parallel. This action was abolished by pretreatment with a mixture of phentolamine, propranolol and haloperidol at concentration sufficient to block the receptors. However, it was not influenced by treatment with haloperidol alone. Cerebrocortical NPY-ir was lowered in rats receiving an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of methoxamine, the agonist of alpha 1-adrenoceptors. This action was prevented by prazosin via an i.c.v. injection at the dose sufficient to block alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Moreover, decrease of cerebrocortical NPY-ir by pargyline was also reversed by similar treatment of prazosin. The data obtained suggests that activation of alpha 1-adrenoceptors by endogenous NE which was increased by pargyline may lower the contents of NPY in cerebrocortex of the rat.", 
    "105": "Binding sites for 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)[3H]tropane ([3H]WIN 35,428) on the human dopamine transporter expressed in C6 glioma cells were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and the protective potency of the blockers cocaine, N[1-(2-benzo[b]thiophenyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine (BTCP), and benztropine, and of the substrates dopamine, d-amphetamine, and norepinephrine was measured. In general, the protective potency was lower (at least 4-5 times) than the potency in inhibiting [3H]WIN 35,428 binding with the compounds present under the same experimental conditions used for the NEM alkylation. However, the disparity was substantially greater for all substrates tested (23- to 44-fold) than for the blockers (4- to 11-fold), especially cocaine (5-fold) and BTCP (4-fold). Benztropine took an intermediate place (11-fold) between cocaine (5-fold) and BTCP (4-fold), on the one hand, and dopamine (23-fold), on the other hand. [3H]WIN 35,428 binding was best described by a one-site model under the present conditions. The results are discussed in terms of models involving blocker-induced conformational changes and overlapping nonidentical binding domains for blockers and substrates.", 
    "106": "K+ and Na+ influx into frog erythrocytes incubated in standard saline was studied using 86Rb and 22Na as tracers. 10 microM isoproterenol (ISP) produced a significant increase in K+ influx for the first 15 min, which was sustained during the entire 60 min of cell incubation. Treatment of red cells with the phosphodiesterase (PDE) blockers theophylline (THEO, 1 and 5 mM) or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 0.5 mM) was also accompanied by an enhancement in K+ influx. A distinct additive effect on K+ influx into red cells was found when ISP and THEO or IBMX were added together. The increase in K+ transport induced by ISP plus IBMX was totally abolished by pretreatment of red cells with 0.1 mM ouabain. The ouabain-sensitive K+ influx in frog erythrocytes was elevated in the presence of ISP plus IBMX to 2.05 +/- 0.45, as compared with the control level of 0.39 +/- 0.11 mmol/L cells/hr (P < 0.001). Similar effects of ISP and IBMX on K+ influx were observed after chloride was replaced by nitrate. A dose-related increase in K+ influx into frog erythrocytes was observed at ISP concentrations of 10(-8)-10(-6) M, with a half-maximal stimulatory concentration of approximately 0.02 microM. The effects of ISP (10(-8)-10(-5) M) on K+ transport were completely abolished with 10 microM of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol, but alpha-adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine, prazosin, and yohimbine) did not alter the ISP-induced increase in K+ influx. The drugs tested had no effect on 22Na influx in frog red cells, but ISP produced a small decline (13%) in intracellular Na+ concentration. Thus, our study indicates that catecholamines and PDE blockers enhance K+ (86Rb) transport in frog erythrocytes mediated by Na(+)-K+ pump activity. The frog erythrocyte membrane may serve as a convenient model to investigate the hormonal modulation of the Na(+)-K+.", 
    "107": "The B2 bradykinin receptor, a seven-helix transmembrane receptor, binds the inflammatory mediator bradykinin (BK) and the structurally related peptide antagonist HOE-140. The binding of HOE-140 and the binding of bradykinin are mutually exclusive and competitive. Fifty-four site-specific receptor mutations were made. BK's affinity is reduced 2200-fold by F261A, 490-fold by T265A, 60-fold by D286A, and 3-10-fold by N200A, D268A, and Q290A. In contrast, HOE-140 affinity is reduced less than 7-fold by F254A, F261A, Y297A, and Q262A. The almost complete discordance of mutations that affect BK binding versus HOE-140 binding is surprising, but it was paralleled by the effect of single changes in BK and HOE-140. [Ala9]BK and [Ala6]BK are reduced in receptor binding affinity 27,000- and 150-fold, respectively, while [Ala9]HOE-140 affinity is reduced 7-fold and [Ala6]HOE-140 affinity is unchanged. NMR spectroscopy of all of the peptidic analogs of BK or HOE-140 revealed a beta-turn at the C terminus. Models of the receptor-ligand complex suggested that bradykinin is bound partially inside the helical bundle of the receptor with the amino terminus emerging from the extracellular side of helical bundle. In these models a salt bridge occurs between Arg9 and Asp286; the models also place Phe8 in a hydrophobic pocket midway through the transmembrane region. Models of HOE-140 binding to the receptor place its beta-turn one alpha-helical turn deeper and closer to helix 7 and helix 1 as compared with bradykinin-receptor complex models.", 
    "108": "The presence of insulin and insulin binding sites in the central nervous system and the demonstration that central insulin has an effect on cardiovascular function has led to the hypothesis that insulin may play a role in mediating the baroreceptor reflex. To investigate this possibility, insulin was microinjected into depressor sites in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), the first central synapse of the baroreceptor reflex, of urethane anesthetized rats. Microinjection of insulin into the NTS (110 nL of 1, 10 and 100 IU/mL) did not change mean arterial pressure (MAP) or heart rate (HR). However, insulin microinjection attenuated phenylephrine-elicited reflex bradycardia and depressor responses elicited by glutamate (GLU). The attenuation of GLU-elicited depressor responses was time-dependent for MAP changes and time and concentration-dependent for HR changes (p < 0.05). Insulin-like growth factor-1 microinjection into the NTS also attenuated GLU-elicited decreases in MAP (p < 0.05) but not HR. The effect of insulin on GLU-elicited responses was inhibited after peripheral adrenergic blockade by nadolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) but not after cholinergic blockade by methyl-atropine (2.0 mg/kg i.v.). These results demonstrate that insulin inhibits baroreceptor reflex responses in the NTS likely through an influence on the effects of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters on the activity of NTS neurons involved in sympathetic control of the cardiovascular system.",

The study population of 27 was composed of 16 female and 11 male, mean age 56.1 +/- 8.4. The dose of oral sotalol was 160 mg/day for all days. Recording of ASAECG and 24-hours Holter monitoring were made at baseline, after 10 days and after 6 weeks of sotalol therapy. For ASAECG were calculated time-domain parameters: the root mean square voltage of the signals in the last 10, 20, 30 ms of the filtered P-wave (RMS 10, 20, 30) and total time duration of filtered P-wave (PWD) and time duration of P-wave for Frank leads X, Y, Z (XP, YP, ZP). During frequency-domain analysis of the terminal part of P-wave we calculated the following parameters in range from 40 Hz to 400 Hz: energy spectrum > -60 dB (A) and decibel drop at 40 Hz (Dd) in logarithmic scale and area ratio 20-50/0-20 Hz (Ar), magnitude ratio (MR1-7) in linear scale for a vector magnitude. Supraventriculat arrhythmias were estimated quantitatively and qualitatively during Holter monitoring. The following parameters were estimated in a case of PAF recording: time of manifestation, duration, number of PAF episodes per day, mean heart rate during PAF and subjective symptoms. Moreover, comparable analysis of the following parameters: dimension of left atrial, age, gender, time duration of IHD and PAF and wall motion disturbances-hypokinesis and also left ventricular ejection fraction, mitral regurgitation was done between patients with effective and no effective of antiarrhythmic therapy. Our observation have indicated that oral sotalol therapy are responsible for statistically significant decrease of total time duration of filtered P-wave (PWD) and time duration of P-wave for Frank leads X, Y, Z (XP, YP, ZP) and increase area ratio 20-50/0-20 Hz in patients with PAF during IHD.

In rats treated simultaneously with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 5 IU/rat, sc) the same dose or propranolol (6.0 mg/kg) significantly increased the stimulatory effect of hCG on testosterone secretion by 1.8-fold, but hCG did not modify the stimulatory effect of propranolol on TIF volume. These results demonstrate a direct stimulatory effect of propranolol on TIF volume and testosterone secretion, both under basal and hCG-stimulated conditions.",

Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography at the parasternal long axis were performed at rest and during an exercise protocol, which consisted of two stages of 50 and 100 W. Using the digitized data from the M-mode echocardiogram, the normalized maximal increase in LV dimension during the rapid filling phase (nmD) was calculated according to H\u00f6rtnagl. Additionally the ECG was recorded at R and during Ex 60 min after this first test. 0.02 mg.kg body mass-1 propanolol and 0.04 mg.kg body mass-1 atropine were injected intravenously over a 5-min period and the test procedure was repeated as described above. Before AB nmD increased significantly from resting values to 100 W in both groups, whereas nmD tended to be lower in UT compared to TR. During AB nmD of UT was rather unchanged at R and during EX compared to pre-blockade conditions. In contrast nmD of TR was slightly reduced and this difference was significant at 100 W. No major difference in nmD between the TR and UT group could be observed during AB. Before and during AB HR of TR were significantly lower at rest, 50 and 100 W compared to UT. We conclude that the enhanced diastolic relaxation observed in endurance athletes seems to be due to a training-induced adaptation of the autonomic nervous system.", 
    "125": "Congestive heart failure is a lethal condition that affects an increasing number of patients. In recent years a great amount of data have accumulated on the pathophysiology and medical and surgical therapy of this condition. In spite of the advances in its management and the great number of patients affected, common errors are still made by internists and cardiologists in the use of drugs and therapeutic strategies. Digitalis has only recently been shown to affect hemodynamics, exercise capacity, and clinical symptoms, but the effects on survival still have to be demonstrated. Loop diuretics, eventually combined with thiazides and antialdosterone drugs in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of fluid retention, are the mainstays of therapy of congestive heart failure. In order to make diuretic therapy efficacious, moderate salt and water intake restriction is mandatory. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now considered unavoidable drugs in the management of heart failure, and an attempt to reach the doses that have been shown to be efficacious for survival in the large trials has to be made in every patient with this condition. Other vasodilators, such as hydralazine and nitrates, which show a less pronounced effect on survival but more effective hemodynamic actions than ACE inhibitors, may be used to control mitral insufficiency or to improve hemodynamics in very sick patients. Hemodynamic instability refractory to increasing doses of vasodilators and diuretics is a severe condition that requires hospital admission to administer drugs parenterally. These patients are usually treated with the combination of catecholamines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors associated with intravenous diuretics until clinical stability is again achieved and oral therapy is resumed and restructured. The use of aggressive pharmacological therapy and phosphodiesterase inhibitors has reduced the need for assisted circulatory support in these patients. Beta-blockers have shown promising results when administered to patients with heart failure, although a definitive demonstration of their effects on survival is still lacking. Other additional measures that need to be considered in patients with end-stage congestive heart failure are the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and anticoagulation.", 
    "126": "Although there is undoubtedly a link between ventricular dysfunction and heart failure the interrelationship is complex. Most patients with left ventricular dysfunction die before progression to heart failure. Heart failure is not preceded by a period of chronic left ventricular dysfunction for the large number of patients who develop heart failure soon after a myocardial infarction. Atrial fibrillation and myocardial ischaemia/infarction need to be considered as mechanisms of progression as well as left ventricular remodelling. ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, but not diuretics or digoxin, may alter progression to and of heart failure. Potential adverse effects of aspirin on prognosis in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease are cause for considerable concern.",

    "131": "Inhibitory effects of the class III antiarrhythmic compound D/L-sotalol on acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) isoenzymes of both erythrocytes and the human caudate nucleus and on serum cholinesterase (ChE; EC 3.1.1.8) were studied in vitro using a spectrophotometric kinetic assay with acetylthiocholine (ASCh) as substrate. Sotalol concentrations in the assays varied from 0.32 to 3.2 mM. All isoenzymes studied were inhibited by D/L-sotalol in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Double reciprocal plots of the reaction velocity against varying ASCh concentrations revealed that D/L-sotalol reduced substrate affinity (apparent Michaelis constant, KM, increased) of serum ChE, but did not change the enzyme's maximal rate of ASCh hydrolysis (Vmax). Thus, D/L-sotalol inhibition of serum ChE was of the competitive type (rate constant for reversible competitive inhibition: Ki = 0.51 mM). In contrast, D/L sotalol reduced the maximal reaction velocity of the AChE isoenzyme from the central nervous system (caudate nucleus), but had no influence on substrate affinity of the enzyme (KM with ASCh unchanged) indicating purely non-competitive inhibition kinetics (rate constant of reversible non-competitive inhibition: Ki = 0.44 mM). D/L-sotalol inhibition of erythrocyte AChE was of mixed competitive/non-competitive type (Ki = 0.31 mM, Ki = 0.49 mM). Non-competitive D/L-sotalol inhibition of caudate nucleus AChE and the non-competitive component of erythrocyte AChE inhibition cannot be overcome by increased concentrations of the cholinergic transmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Peak D/L-sotalol plasma levels as described in the literature for both humans (15 microM) and experimental animals (dogs: 18 microM; rats: 260 microM) as well as maximal myocardial concentrations of the substance (dogs: 46 microM; rats: 478 microM) are in the range of about 2% to 100% of the sotalol inhibition rate constants determined in the present paper for cholinesterase isoenzymes in vitro. Thus, D/L-sotalol inhibition of ACh hydrolysis in vivo may contribute to both the well known antiarrhythmic potential and proarrhythmic side effects of the compound.",

Three different groups, each of 20 patients with newly diagnosed primary openangle glaucoma were assigned to be treated by studied drugs independently. Authors conclude that all three drugs reliably lowered intraocular pressure. BETOPTIC and VISTAGAN did not influence on pulse frequency, blood pressure and lung capacity. Apart from the fact that VISTAGAN is considered to be non-selective betablocker, its efficacy is comparable with those of selective betablockers.", 
    "133": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor has been the focus of considerable research effort over a decade. However, the definitive classification of this receptor and the full characterization of its pharmacology is still in progress. On the one hand, the selective serotonin-1A receptor partial agonist anxiolytics were developed first and represented a new class of pharmacological agents that have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). These compounds (e.g. buspirone, gepirone, tandospirone or ipsapirone) offered a completely different pharmacologic approach to this disorder from previous medications as benzodiazepines or alcohol. On the other hand, beta-adrenoceptor blockers (e.g. [-]-pindolol, [-]-propranolol) have been shown to have antagonistic properties on the 5-HT1A receptor side. Preliminary results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor blockers may be useful as adjunctive medication in the treatment of depression by augmenting the antidepressant efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. As the beta-adrenoceptor blockers show also affinities to other 5-HT receptors than the 5-HT1A receptor the recently discovered more selective 5-HT1A antagonists became of interest. The pharmacological properties and potential therapeutic utility of these novel compounds will also be discussed.", 
    "134": "Ovarian blood volume was quantified by measuring optical density (414 nm) of haemoglobin in ovarian extracts and comparing it with that of known amounts of whole blood in the cyclic mature female rats during estrous cycle and periovulatory period. Haemoglobin in ovarian extracts had the same peak absorbance of 414 nm characteristic of oxyhaemoglobin in whole blood taken by cardiac puncture of the rats. There was a linear relationship between the absorbance and volume of whole blood in the sample. The ovarian blood volume was lowest on the day of metestrus and slightly increased on the day of diestrus. On the night of proestrus, the blood volume significantly increased and showed a gradual increase during preovulatory period from 0030 hrs to 0230 hrs and then started decreasing and reached a preovulatory level on the morning of estrus. Ovulation had occurred only in the rats sacrificed after 0230 hrs. Treatment of rats with indomethacin and propranolol significantly reduced the ovarian blood volume observed during the ovulatory period. Epinephrine and norepinephrine did not affect the ovarian blood volume. The results show that the ovarian blood volume changes significantly during the estrous cycle and reaches at maximum level at the time of ovulation which perhaps reflect vasodilatation and hyperemia associated with this process.",

    "137": "The aim of this work was to determine the possible participation of adrenergic responses to the increase in tumor dissemination induced by rotational stress using drugs affecting monoaminergic function. The growth of the primary tumor and the formation of lung metastasis were determined in mice implanted with Lewis lung carcinoma, subjected to rotational stress and treated with the adrenergic neuron blocker reserpine, the alpha-receptor blocker phenoxybenzamine, and the beta-blocker propranolol. Treatment with reserpine markedly reduced the formation of spontaneous lung metastasis and completely abolished the increase in metastases caused by rotational stress without direct effect on tumor cells or blood vessels. Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol caused opposite effects on tumor progression. Previous immunosuppression by cyclophosphamide in mice with tumors reduced the antimetastatic effects of reserpine. These results suggesting the importance of the adrenergic modulation of immune resistance factors in controlling metastasis development and indicate a possible role in monitoring the use and effects of monoaminergic drugs in cancer patients.",

All heterocyclic derivatives synthesized (1-17) were less active than the reference propranolol on the rat heart, while showed a comparable potency on the guinea pig trachea, exhibiting a significant beta 2-selectivity. The low beta-blocking potency of the five membered derivatives seemed to confirm the negative influence of the polarization of the oximic carbon in the binding with non polar region of the beta-adrenoreceptor. Another important interaction could take place with the enzyme adenyl-cyclase which is responsible of the signal of transduction. It could be hypothesized that the heteroatom of the heterocyclic nucleus acted as an electron-donor group and engaged a coordinative bond with magnesium atom present on the adenylcyclase system, responsible of the agonist activity. The pharmacological in vivo experiments and the binding results were in accordance with the in vitro data.", 
    "139": "Recently we have shown that ACE inhibitors and platelet activating factor antagonists inhibit iron-dependent lipid peroxidation in murine ventricular membranes and possess beneficial effects on ischemia and ischemia reperfusion-induced myocardial injury, which has been ascribed to their capacity to scavenge or impair oxygen free radical generation. In the present study we investigated the effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockers and calcium antagonists on iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) in murine ventricular membranes and compared them with the lazaroid U-74500A, a potent antioxidant. Fe(2+)-vitamin C induced LPO in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation. Pretreatment of ventricular membranes with gallopamil, verapamil, propranolol and metaprolol at concentrations of 5 microM and higher inhibited Fe(2+)-vitamin C-induced LPO in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 192.8-208.3 microM; however, they were less potent than U-74500A (IC50 6.8 microM). In contrast, atenolol, timolol, diltiazem and nifedipine inhibited LPO at very high concentrations with IC50 values of 864.5-971.5 microM. Inhibition of LPO may not be due to the drugs' classical pharmacological actions, but rather to their characteristic chemical structures or physicochemical interactions with biological membranes. In view of the pathological importance of LPO in cardiac ischemic injury, inhibition of LPO by gallopamil, verapamil, propranolol and metaprolol may provide additional cardioprotective activity and thus reinforces their beneficial effects in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.", 
    "140": "In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind study, 24 patients with essential hypertension were given the angiotensin II antagonist losartan, or the beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol. Both drugs reduced blood pressure (BP) well, but losartan tended to reduce left ventricular mass (LVM) in contrast to atenolol. Following the double-blind phase 19 patients entered an open treatment period with losartan and additional treatment if BP was uncontrolled. LV structures were measured by echocardiography. The mean follow-up period was 29 +/- 2.6 (range 26-32) months. BP was reduced from 155.6 +/- 15.6/103.4 +/- 5.2 mm Hg to 131.3 +/- 10.5/82.7 +/- 3.3 mm Hg (P < 0.001). LV internal diameter was reduced (50.7 +/- 4.5 to 49.1 +/- 4.0 mm; P = 0.006), while there was an increase in interventricular septal thickness (10.2 +/- 1.1 to 11.2 +/- 1.3 mm; P = 0.001) and posterior wall thickness (10.0 +/- 0.9 to 10.6 +/- 1.1 mm; P = 0.023). Calculated LVM was not significantly altered during the follow-up period. In conclusion, losartan is effective in reducing BP during long-term treatment. No significant effect on LVM was observed, but there was an increase in LV wall thickness.", 
    "141": "Topical therapy with beta-antagonists, such as timolol, may cause unrecognized impairment of respiratory and cardiovascular function in elderly people. Beta-antagonists with intrinsic sympathomimetic or cardioselective properties, such as carteolol or betaxolol, may cause less impairment. In a randomized, double-masked study of glaucoma patients, over 60 years of age, without history of bronchospasm and who were using timolol (0.5%), 60 patients were allocated to betaxolol (0.5%) or carteolol (2%) or continued timolol (0.5%) treatment. Spirometry, pulse and blood pressure were measured on enrollment and after 4 weeks. In the timolol and carteolol groups there were no significant changes in mean spirometric values. Changing to betaxolol improved mean peak flow (PF) by 9.1%, from 310 to 3411/min (p < 0.05) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by 9.4%, from 1.74 to 1.861 (p < 0.05). Differences in the changes in PF and FEV1 between betaxolol and timolol as well as betaxolol and carteolol groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Twenty-one per cent of those allocated to betaxolol showed clinically significant improvement in FEV1. There was no change in pulse or blood pressure when carteolol was substituted for timolol but an increase of 10 beats per minute (p < 0.05) in mean resting pulse in the betaxolol group. Therapy with cardioselective beta-blockade may offer significant advantages in respiratory function for elderly people with glaucoma over non-selective drugs, even if they have sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "142": "Preconditioning is known to decelerate degradation of the tissue adenine nucleotides during ischemia and to delay ischemic myocardial necrosis. However, it is not known whether these two phenomena are related. To obtain an insight into this question, the present study examined whether adenosine and B2 receptor antagonists, which block the infarct size-limiting effect of preconditioning, modify the interstitial purine levels during preconditioning and subsequent sustained ischemia. In pentobarbital anesthetized open-chest rabbits, a microdialysis probe was placed in the territory of a branch of the left coronary artery, and perfused with Ringer solution. Preconditioning was performed with 5 min ischemia/5 min reperfusion. Dialysate adenosine and inosine were elevated from the baseline values of 0.064 +/- 0.011 and 0.329 +/- 0.044 microM to 0.189 +/- 0.069 and 4.106 +/- 1.451 microM, respectively during preconditioning, but their elevation during a subsequent 20 min of ischemia was significantly lower compared with that in the non-preconditioned myocardium. This suppression of the purine accumulation during ischemia by preconditioning was not abolished by 2 micrograms/kg of Hoe 140, a specific B2 receptor antagonist, or by 10 mg/kg of 8-phenyltheophylline, a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist. Since the doses of Hoe 140 and 8-phenyltheophylline are sufficient to block the infarct size-limiting effect of preconditioning, the present results suggest that there is a dissociation between the suppression of adenine nucleotide degradation during ischemia by preconditioning and the enhancement of myocardial resistance against infarction. Thus, it is unlikely that a reduction of adenine nucleotide utilization by preconditioning is sufficient to protect the myocardium against ischemic necrosis.", 
    "143": "The migrainous syndrome secondary to a parieto-occipital arteriovenous malformation usually presents as unilateral headache with visual aura of progressive severity. We report successful prevention by atenolol of migraine with visual aura associated with an occipital vascular malformation. Effectively preventing migraine delayed specific therapeutic measures, thereby exposing the patient to the risk of an intracranial hemorrhage. The authors consider that prophylactic therapy should not be started whenever such an association is suspected.", 
    "144": "The effects of nipradilol, an ocular hypotensive drug, on isolated canine retinal central arteries and on retinal arterioles in vivo were investigated. Nipradilol (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/l) produced a dose-related relaxation of the arterial strips contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha which was not influenced by timolol or indometacin. The median effective concentration of this drug was five times that of glycerol trinitrate (GTN). The nipradilol-induced relaxation in the endothelium-intact strips was not influenced by NG-nitro-L-arginine, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, but was abolished by oxyhemoglobin and methylene blue. Treatment with high concentrations of sodium nitroprusside abolished the response to nipradilol, as observed with that to GTN. Retinal arterial strips responded to isoproterenol with a slight relaxation which was depressed by nipradilol. In anesthetized dogs, intra-arterial injections of nipradilol dilated the retinal arterioles in the ocular fundus; the dilator potency was approximately one fifth that of GTN. It is concluded that nipradilol dilates canine retinal arteries in vitro and arterioles in vivo, possibly due to activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and increased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate that are associated with nitric oxide liberated from the molecule itself in the tissue but not derived from the endothelium and perivascular nerve. Beta adrenoceptor blocking action was determined in the retinal artery.", 
    "145": "The effects of optical isomers of ephedrine and methylephedrine on the guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle were studied. l-Ephedrine markedly caused a graded relaxation of the guinea pig trachea where the tone had been raised spontaneously. A rightward shift of the l-ephedrine concentration-response curve was observed for propranolol and butoxamine, and the pA2 values for propranolol and butoxamine were 8.55 and 6.38, respectively. d-Methylephedrine markedly caused a graded relaxation of the guinea pig trachea contracted with histamine. Propranolol and bupranolol did not affect the relaxant response to d-methylephedrine. d-Methylephedrine competitively antagonized the contractile responses to histamine, and the pA2 value for d-methylephedrine was 5.12. These results suggest that l-ephedrine-induced relaxation of the guinea pig trachea is mediated through beta 2-adrenoceptors, whereas d-methylephedrine relaxes the guinea pig trachea by blocking histamine receptors.", 
    "146": "The obese (ob) gene has been cloned recently and its protein product is called \"leptin\". Leptin is an adipocyte-derived satiety factor that regulates body weight homeostasis. Several hormonal factors have been reported to regulate ob mRNA expression. To determine which factors are most important for regulation of ob mRNA expression, we examined the effects of insulin, dexamethasone, a beta3-adrenergic agonist (CGP12177A), 8-bromo-cAMP, 8-bromo-cGMP and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX) on primary cultured adipocytes. Rat adipocytes obtained from epididymal fat were cultured using the ceiling method. Total RNA was extracted and the expression of ob mRNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. After 24 h of incubation, 100 nmol/l insulin significantly increased the expression of ob mRNA (21.4-fold compared to control). Moreover, insulin increased ob mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner over a range of 1-100 nmol/l. The effect of 100 nmol/l insulin was similar to that seen with 20% newborn calf serum. Dexamethasone (25-1000 nmol/l) also increased ob mRNA expression (2.5-2.9-fold). The effect of dexamethasone occurred more rapidly than insulin. CGP12177A (1-10 micromol/l) and 0.5 mmol/l 8-bromo-cAMP had no effects, whereas 0.5 mmol/l 8-bromo-cGMP and 0.5 mmol/l MIX had stimulatory effects (2.8- and 2.4-fold increase in ob mRNA, respectively). The combination of 250 nmol/l dexamethasone and 0.5 mmol/l MIX did not have an additive effect on ob mRNA levels. Our present data suggest that, of these agents, insulin is the most important factor regulating ob mRNA expression.",

    "148": "A randomized, double-masked, cross-over clinical trial was conducted, comparing the ocular hypotensive effect of timolol maleate 0.25 percent, both with and without occlusion of the inferior punctum with the Freeman silicone punctal plug. Following a 2-week washout of topical medication, 17 subjects with early primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension received one drop of timolol 0.25 percent in each eye with or without punctal plugs in place. Blood pressure, resting pulse rate, and intraocular pressure were measured both before timolol instillation and at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours following drop instillation. Following a 2-week washout period, the subjects were evaluated with the alternative treatment.", 
    "149": "There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.648) in IOP levels between treatment groups.", 
    "150": "This pilot suggests that need for a longer-term study with larger numbers of subjects to evaluate the potential role of silicone punctal plugs to enhance the ocular bioavailability of topically applied antiglaucoma medications."
