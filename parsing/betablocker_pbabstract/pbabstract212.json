Carvedilol's antioxidant effect has mostly focused on lipid or amino acid so far. However, there has been no data that carvedilol reduces DNA damage in human hypertension. Never-treated mild to moderate hypertension patients and age- and sex-matched control subjects volunteered for the study. The hypertension subjects were given 12.5 or 25 mg of carvedilol or hydrochlorothiazide orally for 2 months and controls were not given any. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after carvedilol. Plasma highly sensitive 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (hs8-OHdG) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were checked with the samples. There were no statistical differences in clinical characteristics in 3 groups. The hs8-OHdG declined from 9.07+/-4.23 ng/mL to 5.74+/-3.89 ng/mL (P=0.002) after carvedilol. However, it did not show significant reduction after hydrochlorothiazide (9.01+/-3.89 versus 8.23+/-4.12 ng/mL; P=NS). In the control group, the hs8-OHdG concentration was 3.41+/-2.03 ng/mL and 3.01+/-2.65 ng/mL at baseline and 2 months later, respectively (P=NS). The baseline hs8-OHdG levels were higher in hypertension groups compared with control (P=0.000). The hsCRP had no significant difference before and after the tested drugs in 2 hypertension groups (group A: 0.21+/-0.51 versus 0.19+/-0.37 mg/dL; group B: 0.20+/-0.45 versus 0.18+/-0.42 mg/dL). In conclusion, DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species occurs more in the hypertension patients than normals. Carvedilol significantly reduces DNA damage in the hypertension patients.", 
    "1": "Ouabain, an inhibitor of the sodium pump, has been identified as a constituent of bovine adrenal glands. We were interested whether the release of this cardiotonic steroid is stimulated by physical exercise. Hence, athletes and healthy dogs were subjected to ergometry. Ouabain-like compound (OLC) was measured in venous blood by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as well as by (86)Rb+ uptake inhibition (as ouabain equivalents). OLC increased in venous blood of athletes after 15 minutes of ergometry from 2.5+/-0.5 to 86.0+/-27.2 nmol/L (n=51; P<0.001), as did the concentration of a circulating inhibitor of the sodium pump from 7.3+/-1.7 to 129.8+/-51 nmol/L (ouabain equivalents, P<0.05). Half-maximal increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure occurred at 5.1+/-1.2 nmol/L and at 30+/-1 nmol/L OLC, respectively. On rest, OLC decreased in humans and dogs with a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes. In beagles exposed to moderate exercise on a treadmill for 13 minutes, levels of OLC increased 46-fold (from 3.7+/-0.8 to 166.9+/-91.8 nmol/L; n=6; P<0.005). This effect was suppressed when the dogs had been treated for 3 weeks with the beta1-adrenergic receptor blocker atenolol or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril. We conclude that OLC changes rapidly during exercise and is under the control of norepinephrine and angiotensin II.",

    "7": "Recent findings have given evidence a role for noradrenergic transmission in the mechanisms underlying behavioural sensitization to psychostimulants. This work was undertaken to investigate the possible role of beta-adrenergic receptors in amphetamine-induced behavioural sensitization in rats. Rats were sensitized by a single administration of amphetamine (1 mg/kg s.c.) and challenged with the same dose 7 d later. The beta(1) /beta(2) -adrenergic receptor antagonists timolol (10 mg/kg i.p.) and nadolol (10 mg/kg i.p.), which respectively cross or do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, were injected prior to the first or second amphetamine administration. Timolol, but not nadolol, prevented the initiation of behavioural sensitization without interfering with the expression of the sensitized response or the acute locomotor response to amphetamine. Since we found amphetamine-induced fos-activated cells closely associated with dopamine beta-hydroxylase immunoreactive varicosities in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), we investigated the effect of a bilateral micro-injection of timolol into this nucleus. Similarly to systemic administration, intra-BNST timolol (2.5 microg/side) prevented the development of behavioural sensitization. These results suggest that central beta-adrenergic receptors could specifically modulate early neuronal changes leading to the development of behavioural sensitization to psychostimulants, and that the BNST could be an important part of the brain circuitry involved in these long-term neuroadaptations.",

    "16": "1. We wanted to search for the mechanism(s) responsible for the brief pressor response induced by anandamide in urethane-anaesthetized rats. 2. The anandamide-induced pressor effect was not modified by the antagonists of cannabinoid CB(1) and vanilloid TRPV(1) receptors, SR 141716A (3 micromol kg(-1)) and capsazepine (1 micromol kg(-1)), respectively, by bilateral vagotomy and by pithing. Replacement of urethane by pentobarbitone virtually abolished the pressor effect of anandamide, both in pithed and vagotomized and in 'intact' rats (i.e. not treated in this manner). 3. The pressor effect of anandamide was reduced by the nonselective TRPV family inhibitor ruthenium red (3 micromol kg(-1)) and by the blocker of L-type calcium channels nifedipine (1 micromol kg(-1)), both in pithed urethane-anaesthetized rats and in 'intact' urethane-anaesthetized rats. The nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.1 or 0.3 micromol kg(-1)) and the nonselective NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (1 micromol kg(-1)) diminished the anandamide-induced vasopressor response in 'intact' but not in pithed rats. The inhibitory effect of propranolol in 'intact' rats was mimicked by the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551 (1 micromol kg(-1)), but not by the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 (1 micromol kg(-1)). 4. The present study revealed that two mechanisms may be responsible for the anandamide-induced pressor response in urethane-anaesthetized rats. The first involves the central nervous system (probably the medulla oblongata) and is sensitive to propranolol and MK-801. The second, which is located peripherally (most probably in blood vessels), is sensitive to nifedipine, ruthenium red and pentobarbitone and, hence, probably represents a Ca(2+)-dependent mode of action.", 
    "17": "Systemic inflammation induces various adaptive responses including tachycardia. Although inflammation-associated tachycardia has been thought to result from increased sympathetic discharge caused by inflammatory signals of the immune system, definitive proof has been lacking. Prostanoids, including prostaglandin (PG) D(2), PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), PGI(2) and thromboxane (TX) A(2), exert their actions through specific receptors: DP, EP (EP(1), EP(2), EP(3), EP(4)), FP, IP and TP, respectively. Here we have examined the roles of prostanoids in inflammatory tachycardia using mice that lack each of these receptors individually. The TXA(2) analog I-BOP and PGF(2alpha) each increased the beating rate of the isolated atrium of wild-type mice in vitro through interaction with TP and FP receptors, respectively. The cytokine-induced increase in beating rate was markedly inhibited in atria from mice lacking either TP or FP receptors. The tachycardia induced in wild-type mice by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was greatly attenuated in TP-deficient or FP-deficient mice and was completely absent in mice lacking both TP and FP. The beta-blocker propranolol did not block the LPS-induced increase in heart rate in wild-type animals. Our results show that inflammatory tachycardia is caused by a direct action on the heart of TXA(2) and PGF(2alpha) formed under systemic inflammatory conditions.",

We investigated the regulation of ACE2 and angiotensin-(1-7) expression in aortas and carotid arteries of 12-wk-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by determining the effect of sustained angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockade with olmesartan (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), n = 13) compared with those that received atenolol (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), n = 13), hydralazine (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), n = 13), or vehicle (n = 21). Systolic blood pressures were approximately 30% lower (P < 0.05) in rats treated for 2 wk with olmesartan compared with vehicle-treated rats. Both atenolol and hydralazine produced similar decreases in systolic blood pressure. ACE2 mRNA in the thoracic aorta of olmesartan-treated rats (n = 8) was fivefold greater (P < 0.05) than that in vehicle-treated rats (n = 16), whereas atenolol (n = 8) or hydralazine (n = 8) had no effect. Immunostaining intensities in rats treated with olmesartan (n = 5) were also associated with increased (P < 0.05) ACE2 and angiotensin-(1-7) in thoracic aorta media compared with vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, immunostaining intensities for both ACE2 and angiotensin-(1-7) were not different from vehicle (n = 5) in carotid arteries of SHR medicated with either atenolol (n = 5) or hydralazine (n = 5). A comparison of vessel wall dimensions showed that olmesartan selectively reduced the thoracic aorta media-to-lumen ratio (P < 0.05) and media thickness (P < 0.05) without an effect on carotid artery morphometry. Compared with vehicle-treated SHR, vascular hypertrophy determined from media and lumen measurements was not changed in SHR given either atenolol or hydralazine. These data represent the first report of ACE2 and angiotensin-(1-7) expression in the aorta and carotid arteries of SHR. Increased ACE2 and angiotensin-(1-7) in association with altered dimensions of the thoracic aorta but not carotid arteries in response to olmesartan treatment provides evidence that this pathway is regulated by AT(1) receptors and may be important in mediating the pressure-independent vascular remodeling effects of angiotensin peptides.",

A mass of evidence has accrued for the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists on both morbidity and mortality across a wide spectrum of patient severity. This evidence has informed the development of management guidelines, although registry data showed that uptake of treatments remained low, leading to research focused on how heart failure care could be delivered more effectively. This has resulted in a range of heart failure management programmes, many of which have been shown to reduce hospital admission rates and to improve adherence with treatments. Multidisciplinary heart failure management programmes that span primary and secondary care are now considered a routine \"standard\" to be aspired to in delivering effective CHF care.

Administration of isoprenaline to anaesthetized rats pre-treated with test compounds significantly blocked both the tachycardial and hypotensive responses induced by isoprenaline. The test compounds shifted the concentration response curves of isoprenaline towards the right for isolated rat right atrial preparations, rat uterus and rat colon, indicating beta(1), beta(2) and beta(3) adrenoreceptor blockade, respectively. The selectivity ratio for beta(1)/beta-adrenoreceptors to DPJ 955 and DPJ 890 was 64.6 and 83.2, respectively. DPJ 890 was more potent in blocking beta(1)-adrenoreceptors and was more selective towards beta(1) receptors than to other beta-adrenoreceptor subtypes. In conclusion, DPJ 955 and DPJ890 have beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity with high selectivity for the beta(1)-adrenoreceptor subtype.", 
    "58": "The cardiac ryanodine receptor has become a subject of increasing interest as its role in the etiology of cardiac disease is becoming more apparent. In this article, we review the current knowledge of the structure and function of the cardiac ryanodine receptor and its implications in cardiac pathophysiology. Cardiac ryanodine receptors function by regulating calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiomyocytes, thereby playing an integral role in excitation-contraction coupling. In heart failure, the myocardium remains in a chronic hyperadrenergic state. This leads to protein kinase A hyperphosphorylation of ryanodine receptors within cardiomyocytes, ultimately leading to calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol and thus impairing excitation-contraction coupling. These mechanisms could partially explain the pathophysiology underlying the reduced cardiac output seen in heart failure. Beta-adrenergic blockade appears to correct the abnormality and reestablishes normal ryanodine receptor function. These calcium leaks can also generate delayed afterdepolarizations, which can lead to fatal arrhythmias. Two genetic diseases have been linked to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor: arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia type 2 and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. As our understanding of this receptor and its modulators deepens, the possibility of clinical application draws near.",

Ankle oedema, dyspnea and fatigue were listed as the most typical CHF symptoms. Almost 80% of surveyed physicians routinely performed ECG and chest radiogram in order to diagnose CHF. Echocardiography was used by only 20% of physicians, and the term \"diastolic CHF\" was familiar to only one third of them. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were used by more than two thirds of doctors, and beta-blockers--by one third. The correct initial recommended dose of enalapril was known to more than half of the physicians, and the target dose--to only one fourth of them. The correct initial recommended dose of carvedilol was known to almost half of the physicians, and the target dose--to only 3% of them. Diuretics were prescribed by 62% of physicians, spironolactone--by half of them, and digitalis--by one third of them.",

Echocardiography is underused which may hamper the accuracy of CHF diagnosis. ACEI and beta-blockers are also underused. These findings demonstrate that knowledge about diagnosis and treatment of CHF is insufficient among primary care physicians and indicate the need for educational and systematic changes, including a wider access to echocardiography.", 
    "68": "Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is thought to be a neuronal mechanism that expands the penumbra zone after focal brain ischemia and that causes migraine aura. Both adrenergic agonists and antagonists significantly influence the size of the penumbra zone and decline the frequency of migraine. To study whether these compounds act by influencing CSD, we applied different drugs topically to an area of the exposed cortex of anesthetized adult rats and observed the migration of CSD-related DC potential deflections across the treated area. The adrenergic agonist norepinephrine (1 mmol/L) and the alpha(2)-agonist clonidine (0.56 mmol/L) blocked reversibly the migration of CSD. The beta-blocker propranolol (250 micromol/L to 1 mmol/L) dose-dependently diminished migration velocity or even blocked migration of CSD. The CSD blockade by the alpha(2)-antagonist yohimbine (1.75 mmol/L) was because of its action on inhibitory 5-HT(1A) receptors. None of the substances in the concentrations used had influence on regional cerebral blood flow or on systemic arterial blood pressure. The data suggest that the interference of these compounds with CSD may contribute to their beneficial therapeutic effect. The effect of beta-receptor antagonists in human migraine needs further exploration, since these drugs also work in migraine without aura.",

    "75": "Integrin beta(3) is polymorphic at residue 33 (Leu(33) or Pro(33)), and the Pro(33)-positive platelets display enhanced aggregation, P-selectin secretion, and shorter bleeding times. Because outside-in signaling is critical for platelet function, we hypothesized that the Pro(33) variant provides a more efficient signaling than the Leu(33) isoform. When compared with Pro(33)-negative platelets, Pro(33)-positive platelets demonstrated significantly greater serine/threonine phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) and myosin light chain (MLC) but not cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 upon thrombin-induced aggregation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of integrin beta(3) and the adaptor protein Shc was no different in the fibrinogen-engaged platelets from both genotypes. The addition of Integrilin (alpha(IIb)beta(3)-fibrinogen blocker) or okadaic acid (serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor) dramatically enhanced ERK2 and MLC phosphorylation in the Pro(33)-negative platelets when compared with Pro(33)-positive platelets, suggesting that integrin engagement during platelet aggregation activates serine/threonine phosphatases. The phosphatase activity of myosin phosphatase (MP) that dephosphorylates MLC is inactivated by phosphorylation of the myosin binding subunit of MP at Thr(696), and aggregating Pro(33)-positive platelets exhibited an increased Thr(696) phosphorylation of MP. These studies highlight a role for the dephosphorylation events via the serine/threonine phosphatases during the integrin outside-in signaling mechanism, and the Leu(33) --> Pro polymorphism regulates this process. Furthermore, these findings support a mechanism whereby the reported enhanced alpha granule secretion in the Pro(33)-positive platelets could be mediated by an increased phosphorylation of MLC, which in turn is caused by an increased phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of myosin phosphatase.", 
    "76": "The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of electrophysiologic study (EPS)-guided sotalol administration combined with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA). This study enrolled 92 patients with both structural heart disease and sustained VTA. Sotalol was administered to 57 patients, and its efficacy was assessed by EPS. Long-term treatment was continued in combination with ICD in 31 patients (57%) whose VTA was no longer inducible (responder group) and in 16 patients whose VTA remained inducible (nonresponder group). The long-term outcomes were compared among the responder group, the nonresponder group, and 35 ICD recipients untreated with antiarrhythmic drugs (ICD-only group). During a mean follow-up of 44 +/- 33 months, the recurrence of VTA was not significantly different between all patients treated with sotalol (30%) and patients in the ICD-only group (46%). However, the recurrence of VTA was significantly lower in the responder (13%) than in the nonresponder (63%) or the ICD-only groups (46%). There was no significant difference in VTA recurrence between the nonresponder and the ICD-only groups. One patient each in the responder and the ICD-only groups died suddenly, and all-cause mortality was similar in the three groups. The incidence of inappropriate ICD discharges was less in the sotalol than in the ICD-only groups. No patient had to discontinue long-term sotalol treatment because of the adverse effects. In conclusion, sotalol reduced VTA recurrence in the responding patients and inappropriate ICD discharge. EPS may predict the efficacy of sotalol for VTA recurrence.", 
    "77": "A colorimetric sensor array composed of seven molecularly imprinted polymers was shown to accurately identify seven different aromatic amines. The response patterns were systematically classified using linear discriminant analysis with 94% classification accuracy. Analyses of the response patterns of the analytes to the imprinted polymer array suggest that the different selectivity patterns, although subtle, appear to arise from the imprinting process. The molecular imprinting process enabled the rapid preparation of the polymers in the array from ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and methacrylic acid (80:20) in the presence of six different template molecules plus a blank nonimprinted polymer. The response of the imprinted polymer array was coupled to a colorimetric response, using a dye displacement strategy. A benzofurazan dye was selected and shown to give an accurate measure of the binding properties of the imprinted polymer array to all seven analytes. The colorimetric response also enabled the inclusion of analytes that are not spectroscopically active and were not among the original analytes that were used as template molecules. This broadens the potential utility of the imprinted polymer sensor array strategy to a wider range of analytes and applications.",

Although propranolol and phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic antagonist), and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isoprophyl)amiloride (a Na+/H+ antiport blocker) changed neither the alveolar fluid clearance nor the norepinephrine clearance rate, amiloride and benzamil (a sodium channel blocker) decreased both clearance rates.

    "87": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors inhibit both the formation of angiotensin II and the catabolism of bradykinin (BK). They prevent not only hypertension but also cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. An increase in BK level stimulates the expression of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) and induces prostaglandins, both of which are powerful vasodilator factors. The direct effect of BK against cardiac hypertrophy is still unclear. This study was performed to examine the cardioprotective effects of BK in hypertrophic models. Renovascular hypertensive (RHT) rats were treated with BK (1,000 ng/kg/day), BK+D-arginyl-[Hyp(3), Thi(5), D-Tic(7), Oic(8)]-bradykinin (HOE140) (a BK B(2) receptor antagonist), and BK+N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (a NOS inhibitor) for 3 weeks. Blood pressure was measured and echocardiographic analysis performed during the treatment. Histological data were analyzed to confirm the hypotrophic effect of BK. Treatment with BK improved cardiac remodeling, reducing both the heart weight/body weight ratio and the left ventricular wall thickness. However, co-treatment with HOE140 or L-NAME reversed the anti-hypertrophic action of BK. In particular, cardiac fibrosis or perivascular fibrosis, along with collagen accumulation, were inhibited by treatment with BK, while HOE140 and L-NAME counteracted these changes. In addition, expressions of atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptides (BNP), which are markers of cardiac abnormalities, were down-regulated by treatment with BK. These effects were reversed by co-treatment with HOE140 and L-NAME. Together, these results indicate that BK directly inhibits the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis due to NO release via the BK B(2) receptor. The BK-NO pathway may play an important role in the progression of cardiac remodeling.",

The present study analyzes sympathetic nonadrenergic neurotransmission in hypertensive (SH-SP) and normotensive (WKY) rats. In addition, adult and young hypertensive rats were compared to investigate the role of aging on sympathetic nonadrenergic cotransmission in hypertensive disease.",

Compared to adult WKY, RNS-induced pressor responses were unchanged in adult SH-SP and young WKY, but significantly greater in young SH-SP rats. The NPY-Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 (1 microM) reduced phentolamine-resistant pressor responses in adult and young WKY, young SH-SP, but not in adult SH-SP rats. In contrast to WKY and young SH-SP rats, exogenously perfused NPY (0.1 microM) was unable to potentiate RNS-induced, phentolamine-resistant pressor responses in adult SH-SP rats. NE and the stable ATP analogue alpha,beta-mATP increased the perfusion pressor response more potently in adult SH-SP than in WKY rats.", 
    "119": "Neuronally released NPY plays a major role in potentiating RNS-induced nonadrenergic pressor responses in kidneys of WKY and young SH-SP rats. In adult SH-SP rats NPY fails to enhance these responses. In this hypertensive model ageing seems to be associated with a loss of a modulatory role of renal NPY Y1 receptors. Since pressor responses to NE and ATP are higher in SH-SP animals, functional NPY-Y1 receptor downregulation might be an adaptive mechanism.", 
    "120": "The documentation of preferential activation of the cardiac sympathetic outflow in patients with heart failure swept aside an entrenched notion that there was a functional sympathetic denervation of the failing heart and provided a theoretical basis for the clinical evaluation of beta-adrenergic blocker therapy in this condition. The demonstration that heightened sympathetic nervous system activity is central to the pathogenesis and progression of congestive heart failure (CHF) has now led to the rational use of beta-adrenoceptor blockade in CHF. More recently, it has also emerged that the aging heart exhibits some of the characteristic changes in autonomic control which are seen in CHF. Accordingly, alterations in cardiac sympathetic nerve function are now thought to contribute also to the pathophysiology of the aging heart. Furthermore, there is evidence that in humans, sympathoexcitatory rostral projections of brainstem noradrenergic neurons to the forebrain are important in the sympathetic nervous activation of both heart failure and aging. Given these similarities, in this review we compare and contrast the neurobiology of the sympathetic nervous system in the failing heart and the healthy, aging heart, and consider whether the sympathetic activation accompanying aging may, perhaps, underlie and contribute to the neural pathophysiology of heart failure. Our conclusion is, on balance, that this proposition is not supported by the available evidence.", 
    "121": "This study evaluated the effect of beta blockade on cardiac autonomic control and its dependence on heart rate change. The relations between RR interval duration, heart rate variability (HRV), and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) were studied in 111 healthy men and in 21 male volunteers before and after a 100-mg oral dose of metoprolol. HRV and BRS correlated significantly with mean RR (r = 0.39, r = 0.57). Metoprolol administration increased both mean RR (from 996 to 1,176 ms, p <0.001), BRS from 24 to 36 ms/mm Hg (p = 0.003), and the SD of RR from 61 to 74 ms (p = 0.05). However, metoprolol-induced changes of HRV and BRS became insignificant (p = 0.69 and 0.48) after they were normalized to the same cycle length, suggesting that the improvement of cardiac autonomic control after beta blockade could be explained by a change of heart rate.", 
    "122": "This study assessed whether a gender gap exists in therapy, procedure use, and outcomes in patients who have a new diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) at the population level. The Quebec hospital discharge database was linked with the physician and drug claims databases to identify a cohort of patients who had a diagnosis of CHF (code 428 in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) between January 1998 and December 2002. There were 16,017 men and 16,622 women. Women who had CHF were older (78 +/- 11 vs 73 +/- 11 years, p <0.001), had more hypertension (41% vs 28%, p <0.001) and hyperlipidemia (18% vs 14%, p <0.001) but less frequent myocardial infarction (19% vs 25%, p <0.001). Women were less likely to see a cardiologist (30% vs 34%, p <0.001) and required a longer hospital stay (12.0 +/- 14.8 vs 10.6 +/- 13.3 days, p <0.001). During the first year after a first CHF hospitalization, women were less like to have an assessment of left ventricular function (61% vs 65%, p <0.001), diagnostic cardiac catheterization (11% vs 15%, p <0.001), and revascularization procedure (4% vs 6%, p <0.001). Women were less likely to be prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (60% vs 66%) and more likely to be prescribed a beta blocker (38% vs 34%). Women and men had similar yearly numbers of rehospitalizations for CHF (1.4 +/- 1.0 vs 1.5 +/- 1.0) and emergency room visits (1.7 +/- 1.2 vs 1.8 +/- 1.3). The adjusted risk of death was minimally higher in men than in women (hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.1, p <0.01). Thus, despite less frequent cardiologist assessment, fewer cardiac-related procedures, and less frequent use of standard medical therapy, clinical outcomes in women and men who had CHF were similar.", 
    "123": "beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) provide multiple benefits to patients with coronary artery disease. The 2001 American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) recommend initiating beta-adrenoceptor blockade in all post-MI patients and continuing therapy indefinitely. Atenolol and metoprolol have been shown to decrease vascular mortality in the acute-MI period. In the post-MI period timolol provided a 39% reduction in mortality in the Norwegian Multicenter Study group and propranolol was associated with a 26% reduction in mortality in BHAT (Beta-blocker Heart Attack Trial). beta-Adrenoceptor antagonist therapy results in reduction of myocardial oxygen demand and is therefore also effective for the treatment of angina pectoris. In CAST (Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial) beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy was associated with a significant reduction in arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest. In the post-MI amiodarone trials EMIAT (European Myocardial Infarct Amiodarone Trial) and CAMIAT (Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Trial) there was a mortality benefit and decreased arrhythmic death in patients who received both amiodarone and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy, compared with patients receiving amiodarone therapy alone. In the post-MI defibrillator (implantable cardioverter defibrillator [ICD]) trials, AVID (Antiarrhythmic Versus Implantable Defibrillator) and MUSTT (Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial), beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy was independently associated with improved overall survival. The exception was the ICD patients in MUSTT, and the benefit was attenuated in the amiodarone and ICD patients in AVID.AHA/ACC guidelines recommend the use of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in all patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, based on several large, controlled heart failure trials. Extended-release metoprolol succinate reduced all-cause mortality by 34% in MERIT-HF (Metoprolol Controlled-Release/Extended-Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart Failure). Bisoprolol was associated with a 34% mortality benefit in CIBIS-II (Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II) and carvedilol was associated with a 35% mortality reduction in the COPERNICUS (Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival) trial. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists reduce perioperative mortality in patients undergoing cardiac as well as non-cardiac surgery; however, they remain underutilised. Contraindications to beta-adrenoceptor antagonist therapy include severe bradycardia, high-grade atrioventricular block, marked sinus node dysfunction and acute exacerbations of heart failure. Many of the perceived adverse effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists have not been substantiated by large clinical trials.beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists differ with regard to receptor selectivity, receptor affinity, lipophilicity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Beneficial properties of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists may not always be extrapolated as a class effect, and patient selection and drug preparations should follow trial guidelines. The beneficial effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are clearly proven in cardiac patients and those at risk for cardiac disease. They are indicated for heart failure and proven beneficial in patients undergoing cardiac and non-cardiac surgery. These benefits appear to be consistent across most patient subgroups. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists are generally well tolerated, yet significant morbidity and mortality result from their continued underutilisation.",

Stenting was used in 89% of cases. N-acetylcysteine was used in 23% of the patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. Thienopyridine (63% clopidogrel) pretreatment was given in 49 % of the cases and, at logistic regression analysis, was independently associated with prior myocardial infarction (p < 0.001), prior PCI (p = 0.007), stable coronary disease (p = 0.005), and treatment in northern Italy (p < 0.05). Platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor blockers (50% abciximab 50% tirofiban) were used in 22% of the stable patients and 40 % of those with ACS, a proportion increasing to 62 % when PCI was undertaken as an emergency procedure. Off-label use of these drugs was frequent (direct cath lab use of tirofiban in 55% of the cases; bailout use: 16% with abciximab and 26% with tirofiban). At logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of GP IIb/IIIa receptor blocker use were emergency procedure (odds ratio 3.6, 95 % confidence interval 2.6 to 5.0, p < 0.0001) and treatment for an ACS (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 2.1, p = 0.0002). An emergency procedure was the only independent predictor for the use of abciximab instead of tirofiban (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 6.5, p < 0.0001). Triple periprocedural antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, a thienopyridine and a GP IIb/IIIa receptor blocker was administered in only 21% of cases. At discharge, all stented patients received aspirin and a thienopyridine. Despite complete procedural success in > 90% of cases, 50% of the patients were discharged on symptomatic anti-ischemic therapy.", 
    "127": "A wide gap exists between guideline recommendations and periprocedural drug therapy in PCI, the only exception being full prescription of aspirin and a thienopyridine at discharge after stenting. In patients with ACS, thienopyridine pretreatment is often used as a surrogate for GP IIb/IIIa blockade, whose use rather is associated with emergency procedures. Off-label use of drugs is not uncommon.",

Nisoldipine decreased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) when compared to either placebo or bisoprolol, and increased the cardiac index (CI) when compared to placebo. During the passive orthostasis, the mononitrate decreased SVRI when compared to placebo or bisoprolol. The mononitrate increased HR and pulse wave velocity (PWV) when compared to the other study groups, and decreased the stroke index when compared to placebo. In the bisoprolol group, the tilt responses of diastolic arterial pressure, HR, CI, left cardiac work index, and PWV decreased significantly compared to those in the placebo group. Nisoldipine did not alter the responses to orthostasis when compared to placebo. When compared to the mononitrate, both nisoldipine and bisoprolol decreased CI response to orthostasis.", 
    "131": "The mononitrate adversely affects the cardiovascular responsiveness to orthostasis. The beta-blocker reduces the responses and thus probably oxygen demand during orthostasis. The dihydropyridine calcium blocker seems to influence the responsiveness less than the mononitrate or beta-blocker.", 
    "132": "Human mast cells express the intermediate conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel iKCa1, which opens following IgE-dependent activation. This results in cell membrane hyperpolarization and potentiation of both Ca2+ influx and degranulation. Mast cell activation is attenuated following exposure to beta2-adrenoceptor agonists such as salbutamol, an effect postulated to operate via intracellular cyclic AMP. In this study, we show that salbutamol closes iKCa1 in mast cells derived from human lung and peripheral blood. Salbutamol (1-10 microM) inhibited iKCa1 currents following activation with both anti-IgE and the iKCa1 opener 1-EBIO, and was reversed by removing salbutamol or by the addition of the selective beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist and inverse agonist ICI 118551. Interestingly, ICI 118551 consistently opened iKCa1 in quiescent cells, suggesting that constitutive beta2-receptor signaling suppresses channel activity. Manipulation of intracellular cAMP, Galphai, and Galphas demonstrates that the beta2-adrenergic effects are consistent with a membrane-delimited mechanism involving Galphas. This is the first demonstration that gating of the iKCa1 channel is regulated by a G protein-coupled receptor and provides a clearly defined mechanism for the mast cell \"stabilizing\" effect of beta2-agonists. Furthermore, the degree of constitutive beta2-receptor \"tone\" may control the threshold for human mast cell activation through the regulation of iKCa1.", 
    "133": "The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) together with its soluble receptor (sIL-6R) induces and maintains thermal hyperalgesia. It facilitates the heat-induced release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from rat cutaneous nociceptors in vivo and in vitro. Here we report that exposure of nociceptive neurons to the IL-6-sIL-6R complex or the gp130-stimulating designer IL-6-sIL-6R fusion protein Hyper-IL-6 (HIL-6) resulted in a potentiation of heat-activated inward currents (I(heat)) and a shift of activation thresholds towards lower temperatures without affecting intracellular calcium levels. The Janus tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG490, the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide 1 (BIM1), as well as rottlerin, a selective blocker of the PKCdelta isoform, but not the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, effectively reduced the effect. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization revealed expression of mRNA for the signal-transducing beta subunit of the receptor gp130 in neuronal somata, rather than satellite cells in rat dorsal root ganglia. Together, the results suggest that IL-6-sIL-6R acts directly on sensory neurons. It increases their susceptibility to noxious heat via the gp130/Jak/PKCdelta signalling pathway.",

After early gastric lavage, electrolytes, cardiac enzymes, chest X-ray, and echocardiography were normal. Dosages of psychotropic drugs were negative. ECG showed a typical coved-type pattern of Brugada syndrome. Follow-up showed partial ECG normalization of the discrete saddleback-type pattern. The ajmaline- test confirmed Brugada syndrome. These ECG modifications may be explained by the stabilizing membrane effect of high concentration of propranolol and/or inhibition of ICaL. This case illustrates the possible deleterious effects of beta-blockers in patients with Brugada syndrome.",

    "139": "Despite the apparent redundancy of NOS isoforms in the myocardium, subcellular compartmentation dictates specific NO signaling from each isoform to colocalized effectors in response to physical (e.g. stretch) or receptor-mediated stimuli. Genetic deletion or overexpression experiments helped to characterize each isoform's respective role in the normal or diseased heart. eNOS and nNOS both contribute to sustain normal EC coupling and contribute to the early and late phases of the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. They also negatively modulate the beta1-/beta2-adrenergic increase in inotropy and chronotropy, and reinforce the (pre- and post-synaptic) vagal control of cardiac contraction, thereby protecting the heart against excessive stimulation by catecholamines. In the ischemic and failing myocardium, iNOS expression is induced and further contributes to attenuate the inotropic effect of catecholamines, as does eNOS coupled to overexpressed beta3-adrenoceptors. nNOS expression also increases in the aging and ischemic heart, but its role (compensatory or deleterious) remains to be defined. Many drugs currently used for the treatment of ischemic or failing cardiac diseases also activate and/or upregulate eNOS in the myocardium, which supports its proposed protective role, e.g. as \"endogenous beta-blocker\". Future pharmacologic modulation of the cardiac NOS will have to take into account their specific modulation of the various aspects of cardiac function, if one hopes to deliver more targeted and efficient therapy than currently achieved with exogenous NO donors.", 
    "140": "Due to the increasing age in western countries, combined with high rates of major surgical interventions in high-risk patients, perioperative reduction of cardiovascular complications becomes increasingly more important for perioperative physicians. After identifying patients with increased perioperative risk, specific interventions need to be considered to reduce their risk for cardiovascular complications, either by perioperative medical therapy or specific treatment options (e.g. coronary intervention). Several trials have demonstrated an effect of perioperative beta-blocker-therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications among high-risk patients. Additionally, several monitoring techniques are effective in detecting cardiovascular complications. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether they are associated with a measurable improvement of outcome. Based on the ACC/AHA-guidelines, the present review describes a stepwise approach to surgical patients to identify perioperative risks, based on specific patient related risk factors, the kind of surgery and on the specific setting (emergency versus elective surgery). In addition, strategies to reduce perioperative cardiovascular complications are discussed.",

The authors sought to test whether a low-intensity CQI intervention could be used to speed the adoption of two coronary artery bypass grafting process-of-care measures on a national level. The infrastructure of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons' National Cardiac Database was used as a CQI Platform in a prospective randomized trial of CQI conducted between January 2001 and July 2002. Preoperative beta-blockade and internal mammary artery grafting in patients aged >75 years were the care processes used. Three hundred fifty-nine National Cardiac Database sites were randomized into two intervention groups (beta blocker, n=124; internal mammary artery grafting, n=114) and one control group (n=114). Each intervention arm received measure-specific information, including a call to action to a physician leader; educational products; and periodic longitudinal, nationally benchmarked, site-specific feedback. Incorporation of the specific care process into everyday clinical practice at the intervention site was the main outcome measure. The analyses included a site-level analysis of differences between pre- and postintervention measure use and a hierarchical analysis using risk-adjustment for patient characteristics and accounting for clustering due to site. Use of beta blockers increased vs. control (Delta=7% vs. Delta=4%), significant at both the site level (p=0.04) and in the hierarchical analyses (p=0.0006). Internal mammary artery graft use also increased vs. control (Delta=9% vs. Delta=5%; p=0.20 and p=0.11, respectively). However, lower volume IMA sites showed significant improvement over lower volume control sites (Delta=14% vs. Delta=8%; p=0.02 for interaction).

As HERG channel blockers which are associated with arrhythmias of the torsades de pointes (TdP) type, dofetilide and sotalol were infused. Verapamil was used as an HERG channel blocker that is not associated with TdP. Dofetilide (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) dose-dependently prolonged QT(c) duration (12% and 16%). Dofetilide also induced an increase of QT variability that reached statistical significance for P(length) at the higher dose (64%).

This study investigates the different impact of different degrees of sympathetic antagonism on circulating levels of cytokines in patients with heart failure resulting from ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC).", 
    "162": "Thirty-five patients with IDC were randomly assigned to receive metoprolol or carvedilol in an open-label study. Echocardiographic measurements and circulating levels of tumor necrosis (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 were obtained at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. The 2 beta-blockers significantly improved the left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced end-diastolic and end-systolic volume. The magnitude of these changes was greater with carvedilol than with metoprolol (respectively P < .001, P < .05, and P < .05). Both treatments induced a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines (for all P < .01), but the decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-1beta was more consistent in the carvedilol group ( P < .01).", 
    "163": "Our results support the hypothesis that a more complete block of sympathetic activity by carvedilol induces a greater decrease in the circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines that could explain, at least in part, the better improvement in the left ventricular remodelling and systolic function in patients with IDC.",

Patients were eligible for registry enrollment if they were hospitalized for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. There were no exclusions to participation. Patients were followed for 60 days. The IMPACT-HF Registry enrolled 567 patients. The mean age was 71 years, 52% of the patients were men and 82% were Caucasian. At discharge, 71% received an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 41% received digoxin, and 62% received beta-blockers.

However, the efficacy of these therapies in patients with coexisting atrial fibrillation has not been adequately assessed. Furthermore, these therapies do not directly address the issue of rhythm management. The use of several antiarrhythmic medications and device therapy is becoming more frequent in the management of this subset of patients. Recent investigations of antiarrhythmic treatment have assessed outcomes such as survival, quality of life, exercise tolerance, and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Data from these studies suggest that antiarrhythmic therapy may be efficacious in such patients. Device therapy is another alternative which has been demonstrated to be at least as beneficial as medical therapy.",

After administration of TLA, there was a greater incidence of burning/stinging and tearing, but not foreign body sensation, relative to TIM. In general, most symptoms were mild in intensity, and no subject discontinued treatment due to ocular discomfort. Both treatments decreased IOP to a similar level.", 
    "173": "TLA was relatively comfortable, with a safety profile consistent with further clinical development, and, with bid dosing (exaggerated [2X] that anticipated for clinical use), had a systemic bioavailability similar to that of TIM 0.5%, bid. The incidence of burning and stinging was higher with TLA than with TIM, although reports were mild in severity and did not result in any patient discontin uations. Although the results are of interest, further evaluation in a larger trial may be warranted.", 
    "174": "1. Renal denervation (RDNX) chronically lowers mean arterial pressure (MAP) in normal rats but mechanisms leading to this hypotensive response remain unknown. 2. We hypothesized that this sustained decrease in arterial pressure was because of a loss of beta1-adrenoceptor mediated renin secretion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to sham (SHAM; n = 9), unilateral (UniRDNX; n = 9), or bilateral (RDNX; n = 10) renal denervation groups and instrumented for telemetric MAP measurements, plasma renin concentration (PRC) measurements and intravenous infusion. Twenty-four h MAP, heart rate, sodium and water balances were recorded 5 days before, 3 days during and 3 days after 1-adrenoceptor blockade with atenolol. 3. The 5-day control MAP was significantly lower in RDNX (97 +/- 1 mmHg) compared to SHAM (105 +/- 2 mmHg) and UniRDNX (102 +/- 2 mmHg) rats. No significant differences in basal PRC were observed between RDNX (2.2 +/- 0.3 ngAng1/mL per h), UniRDNX (2.6 +/- 0.4 ng/Ang1/mL per h) and SHAM (2.6 +/- 0.4 ngAng1/mL per h) rats. By day 1 of atenolol, PRC was significantly lower in UniRDNX rats (1.8 +/- 0.2 ngAg1/mL per h) compared to control values, but was unchanged during atenolol infusion in the other groups. By day 3 of atenolol, MAP was significantly decreased in all groups, but the absolute levels of MAP remained statistically different between RDNX (87 +/- 1 mmHg) and SHAM (91 +/- 1 mmHg) groups. 4. We conclude that the arterial pressure lowering effect of RDNX is not solely dependent on the loss of neural control of renin release.",

The derivative was formed by refluxing practolol-ethyl acetate solution with the solid DNS-Cl in the presence of potassium carbonate anhydride. Room-temperature phosphorescent (RTP) properties of the derivative were studied by a micelle-stabilized room-temperature phosphorescence (MS-RTP) method. Phosphorescence lifetimes of practolol-DNS and the DNS-Cl were found to be 0.791 and 0.408ms, respectively. By applying the derivative MS-RTP technique, practolol could be quantitatively determined without previous separation process.

Three echocardiographic variables predicted the combined end point of death (events = 75), HF hospitalization (events = 97), and transplant (events = 9): LV end-diastolic volume index, mitral deceleration time, and the vena contracta width of MR. Optimal cut points for these variables were 120 ml/m(2), 150 ms, and 0.4 cm, respectively.",

Numerous compounds such as beta-receptor blocking agents or diuretics require derivatization prior to gas chromatographic (GC) and mass spectrometric (MS) measurement, which is the reason for extended sample preparation periods. In addition, several substances demonstrate poor GC-MS properties even after chemical modification, and peptide hormones such as cross-linked hemoglobins cannot be analyzed at all by means of GC-MS. With the availability of electrospray ionization and robust tandem MSs (e.g., triple-stage quadrupole or ion trap instruments) many new or complementary screening and confirmation assays have been developed, providing detailed qualitative and quantitative information on prohibited drugs. With selected categories of compounds (ephedrines, beta-blockers, b2-agonists, diuretics, and bovine hemoglobin-based oxygen therapeutics) that are banned according to the rules of the World Anti-Doping Agency and International Olympic Committee, the advantages of LC-MS-MS procedures over conventional GC-MS assays are demonstrated, such as enhanced separation of analytes, shorter sample pretreatment, and identification of substances that are not identified by GC-MS.",

He was diagnosed as having pheochromocytoma. In spite of a large volume of infusion and insulin therapy, syncope and paroxysmal hypotension continued. We speculated that hypotension was mainly due to vasodilatation caused by excess plasma epinephrine and prescribed a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker. It stabilized blood pressure and syncope disappeared. The right adrenal tumor was excised and he was discharged in good condition.

The in vitro experiments to characterize P-glycoprotein's (P-gp) function and to decrease its effects have led to a variety of strategies such as addition of competitors or supplementation of the medium with oligonucleotides complementary to the 5'-end of the MDR1-mRNA. For the Caco-2 cell line, an in vitro model for absorption screening, expressing multiple transporters including P-gp, which pumps substances back into the apical solution, P-gp activity might mask other relevant transport proteins' activity. The objective of the present study was to construct a Caco-2 subline with reduced P-gp expression level. Caco-2 cells were transfected by electroporation with two different mammalian expression vectors, and the obtained subclones were investigated at RNA (Northern blotting, RT-PCR), protein (FACS analysis), and functional (transport studies) levels for reduction in P-gp expression. Northern blotting showed that the levels of transcription of the inserted gene were different among the several clones, but those results did not completely correlate with the FACS analysis for P-gp expression. The clones with the strongest reduction in P-gp expression detected by the FACS analysis also showed the lowest secretory fluxes of the P-gp substrate talinolol in transport studies. Repetition of FACS analysis after 7 and 24 months on 20 to 30 passage older subclones still showed reduction in P-gp expression and indicated that they are stably transfected. The new cell lines constructed in the present study provide the possibility to perform in vitro absorption studies in a cell system composed of differentiated enterocytes growing as a monolayer like the normal Caco-2 cell line but with a lower down to almost lacking expression of P-gp.", 
    "202": "Beta-blockers are routinely used in all forms of ischaemic heart disease except variant angina. Recently, III generation beta-blockers were introduced into practice. New beta-blockers often have ancillary properties like vaso-dilating or antioxidant properties. Also slow-release formulas of old beta-blockers are now available. Several studies show that these new agents are more efficient when compared with old beta-blockers. Moreover, adverse effects of new beta-blockers are often less severe than in the case of older agents. Especially the influence on bronchi, peripheral arteries and lipid and glucose metabolism is less pronounced. The frequency of beta-blockers use is too low in Poland as well as in other European countries, despite overwhelming evidence that these agents improve prognosis. The results of Cracovian Program for Secondary Prevention of Ischaemic Heart Disease showed that the proportions of patients after myocardial infarction or myocardial revascularization prescribed beta-blockers are too low. One of the reasons is probably the doctors' concern about side effects of beta-blockers. Widespread use of new beta-blockers in everyday clinical practice may increase beta-blocker use in general and in this way improve prognosis of ischaemic heart disease patients in Europe.",

Inhibition was examined under the following two conditions: 1) DMI was co-incubated with BF and NADPH in the reaction mixture containing rat or human liver microsomes or yeast cell microsomes expressing rat CYP2D1, CYP2D2 or human CYP2D6 (co-incubation); 2) DMI was preincubated with NADPH and the same enzyme sources prior to adding the substrate (preincubation). When either rat liver microsomes or recombinant CYP2D2 was employed, the preincubation with DMI (0.3 microM) caused a greater inhibition of BF 1''-hydroxylation than the co-incubation did, whereas BF 1''-hydroxylation by rat CYP2D1 was not markedly affected under the same conditions. The inhibitory effect of DMI on BF 1''-hydroxylation by human liver microsomal fractions or recombinant CYP2D6 was much lower than that on the hydroxylation by rat liver microsomes or CYP2D2. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the inhibition-type changed from competitive for the co-incubation to noncompetitive for the preincubation in the case of CYP2D2, whereas the inhibition-type was competitive for both the co-incubation and the preincubation in the case of CYP2D6. Furthermore, the loss of activity of rat CYP2D2 under the preincubation conditions followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. Binding experiments employing the recombinant enzymes and [(3)H]-DMI revealed that CYP2D2 and CYP2D6 were the only prominent proteins to which considerable radioactive DMI metabolite(s) bound. These results indicate that rat CYP2D2 biotransforms DMI into reactive metabolite(s), which covalently bind to CYP2D2, resulting in inactivation of the enzyme. In contrast, human CYP2D6 may also biotransform DMI into some metabolite(s) that covalently bind to CYP2D6, but that do not inactivate the enzyme.",

Under the used condition, lipase catalyzed the intramolecular transacylation of O-BP into N-butyryl propranolol (N-BP). Propranolol, the product of the expected hydrolysis reaction, was not detected in the reaction medium. A chiral analysis of the reaction product indicated that lipase showed a preference for (R)-O-butyryl propranolol since it first transformed the (R)-enantiomer and then the corresponding (S)-enantiomer. The influence of different reaction conditions on the initial rate is also studied.",

The glucuronide concentrations of propranolol enantiomers were assayed by RP-HPLC. The kinetic constants of glucuronidation, Km, Vmax and Clint were determined. There are significant differences between the R- and S-enantiomeric glucuronide in Km, Vmax and Clint P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 in control microsome. There are significant differences in Km and Clint (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001) but no significant differences in Vmax (P > 0.05) between R and S-enantiomeric glucuronide in the microsomes induced with Dex and BNF. The formation of S-(-)-propranolol glucuronide was inhibited by R-(+)-propranolol from the rat microsomes pretreated with BNF and Dex. The glucuronidation metabolism of propranolol enantiomers exhibited the stereoselectivity in rat hepatic microsomes induced with BNF or Dex. Multiple UGT1A and 2B may be involved in stereoselective O-glucuronidation of propranolol enantiomers in rat liver microsomes. The glucuronides produced were in favor of the R-enantiomer. There is an interaction between the glucuronidation of R- and S-enantiomer.", 
    "210": "A 68-year-old man with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy developed recurrent cardiogenic shock due to dynamic mitral regurgitation. The pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract under medication was 30 mmHg, and he complained of no symptom. He developed shock with dyspnea suddenly after bathing and defecation. Echocardiography and left ventriculography revealed massive mitral regurgitation and mild increment of pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract (50 mmHg). He underwent successful mitral valve replacement following treatment with beta-blocker under intraaortic balloon pumping support. This case illustrates that exacerbation of the systolic anterior motion of the mitral anterior leaflet can cause dynamic severe mitral regurgitation with 'mild' increment of pressure gradient in the left ventricular outflow tract, resulting in cardiogenic shock with severe lung edema.", 
    "211": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is activity-dependent enhancement of synaptic strength that can critically regulate long-term memory storage. Like memory, LTP exhibits at least two mechanistically distinct temporal phases. Early LTP (E-LTP) does not require protein synthesis, whereas the late phase of LTP (L-LTP), like long-term memory, requires protein synthesis. Hippocampal beta-adrenergic receptors can regulate expression of both E-LTP and long-term memory. Although beta-adrenergic receptor activation enhances the ability of subthreshold stimuli to induce E-LTP, it is unclear whether such activation can facilitate induction of L-LTP. Here, we use electrophysiological recording methods on mouse hippocampal slices to show that when synaptic stimulation that is subthreshold for inducing L-LTP is paired with beta-adrenergic receptor activation, the resulting LTP persists for over 6 h in area CA1. Like L-LTP induced by multiple trains of high-frequency electrical stimulation, this LTP requires protein synthesis. Unlike tetanus-induced L-LTP, however, L-LTP induced by beta-adrenergic receptor activation during subthreshold stimulation appears to involve dendritic protein synthesis but not somatic transcription. Maintenance of this LTP also requires activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Thus, beta-adrenergic receptor activation elicits a type of L-LTP that requires translation and ERK activation but not transcription. This form of L-LTP may be a cellular mechanism for facilitation of behavioral long-term memory during periods of heightened emotional arousal that engage the noradrenergic modulatory system."
