    "0": "Partial blockade of beta-adrenergic end-organ response to the autonomic nervous system was effected in a group of older men by administration of propranolol. The result was improved performance in a learning task. The data support the hypothesis that the learning decrement found among older men is not simply a manifestation of structural change in the central nervous system but is, at least in part, associated with the heightened arousal of the autonomic nervous system that accompanies the learning task.", 
    "1": "This paper discusses the management of patients with intractable angina pectoris, and describes the first year's experience with implantation of a carotid sinus nerve stimulator. Seven patients had such stimulators installed; all showed objective evidence of stimulator action through a drop in blood pressure and/or pulse rate. All seven have since shown considerable improvement, enabling them to lead more comfortable lives. One patient derived initially little benefit; this was traced to a mechanical failure of the device which was corrected. However, this patient died of an acute myocardial infarction 15 months after the operation.", 
    "2": "1. The effects of noradrenaline, adrenaline and isoprenaline on neuromuscular transmission in the rat diaphragm and the influence of adrenergic blocking agents on these actions were investigated.2. The resting membrane potential of the muscle fibre was increased by adrenaline (5 x 10(-6)-10(-5) g/ml.) and isoprenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) up to 3-4 mV, but noradrenaline (5 x 10(-6)-10(-5) g/ml.) had little effect.3. The amplitude and the half-decay time of the end-plate potential (e.p.p.) were increased by noradrenaline (1 x 10(-6) g/ml.), adrenaline (1 x 10(-7)-10(-5) g/ml.) and isoprenaline (1-5 x 10(-6) g/ml.). The potentiation of the amplitude of the e.p.p. was greater with noradrenaline than with adrenaline and isoprenaline.4. Noradrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) increased the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (m.e.p.p.), but not their amplitude. However, isoprenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) increased the amplitude of m.e.p.p.s without change in frequency. Adrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) increased both frequency and amplitude of m.e.p.p.s.5. Adrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) and isoprenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) increased the input resistance of the muscle membrane. The effect was blocked by the beta-blocker, pronethalol (2 x 10(-6) g/ml.), but not by the alpha-blocker, phentolamine (2 x 10(-6) g/ml.). Noradrenaline did not change the input resistance of the muscle fibre.6. Noradrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) and adrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) augmented the extracellularly recorded end-plate current (e.p.c.), but they had no effect on the half duration, nor on the action current (a.c.) of the nerve terminal, nor on the synaptic delay. Isoprenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) had no effect on any of these parameters. The actions of noradrenaline and adrenaline on e.p.c. were abolished by phentolamine (2 x 10(-6) g/ml.), but not by pronethalol (2 x 10(-6) g/ml.).7. Adrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) and isoprenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.) enhanced the amplitude of the acetylcholine potential elicited by iontophoretic application of acetylcholine. No such effect was produced by noradrenaline (5 x 10(-6) g/ml.).8. It was concluded that noradrenaline acts on the nerve ending increasing the release of transmitter, and that isoprenaline acts on the post-synaptic membrane enhancing the input resistance, while adrenaline has both presynaptic and post-synaptic actions. The effect on the nerve ending is concerned with the alpha-action, whereas that on post-synaptic membrane with beta-action of the catecholamines.", 
    "3": "1. (-)-Noradrenaline, (-)-alpha-methylnoradrenaline and (-)-isoprenaline were infused into various brain regions of 12-21 day chicks. When infused into the hypothalamic area, but not the cerebral hemisphere or posterior mesencephalon, these amines produced behavioural sleep, lowered temperature and blood pressure and reduced oxygen consumption; electrocortical sleep activity usually ensued but this was not marked and frequently dissociation between electrocortical activity and behaviour occurred. After monoamine oxidase inhibition, which prolonged the action of noradrenaline, dopamine had similar effects.2. The effects of the catecholamines were prevented or substantially reduced by pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine given intravenously or into the hypothalamus but not by intravenous injection of propranolol. However, intrahypothalamic infusion of propranolol prevented the temperature, but not the behavioural effects of noradrenaline. The implications of this are discussed.3. That the effects were similar but more intense, apart from electrocortical changes, and of longer duration than those seen after intravenous injection of catecholamines suggests that in young chicks these amines penetrate from the blood into the brain and elicit their effects through a localized region, presumably the hypothalamus.", 
    "4": "A technique was devised for a more accurate measurement than has been heretofore possible of one of the factors responsible for hyperglycemia in the complex syndrome of diabetes. This factor is termed impedance and represents the tissues' insensitivity or resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake. It was measured by use of steady-state exogenous insulin and glucose infusions during a period of pharmacological suppression of endogenous insulin secretion. Endogenous new glucose production was also inhibited. Impedance as calculated is a direct function of steady-state glucose concentrations, since exogenous insulin concentrations were similar in all studies. Two groups of normal weight subjects were studied. One had maturity onset latent diabetes, and the other (matched for age, weight, and per cent adiposity) was normal. Impedance was closely reproducible in the same individual and remained relatively constant during prolonged infusions. The diabetics had average infusion glucose concentrations (and thus impedance) 68% higher than the normal group, and it is of note that their previously measured glucose intolerance differed by a similar degree; that is, the diabetic's intolerance (as defined by mean weighted plasma glucose response after oral glucose) was 52% greater than that of the normal individuals.", 
    "5": "1. A modified Langendorff heart preparation from the guinea-pig was used to analyse catecholamine responses. Contractile force, heart rate and coronary perfusion pressure were recorded.2. Four components of the vascular response could be identified.(a) The initial phase was a vasoconstriction mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors which preceded any effects on heart rate and force.(b) A secondary constriction followed, which was due to the increased myocardial compression during positive inotropic and chronotropic responses.(c) The third, more predominant, effect was a prolonged dilatation probably associated with the increased metabolic activity of the heart.(d) A fourth component was a direct vasodilatation mediated by beta-adrenoceptors which was evident when small doses of catecholamines were used but was usually masked by the more pronounced metabolically linked dilatation.3. The actions of salbutamol were examined and since it caused direct vasodilatation by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors without other myocardial effects, these adrenoceptors were classified as the beta(2)-type.4. I.C.I. 50,172 was employed to block selectively the myocardial effects due to stimulation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors and leave the vasodilator beta(2)-adrenoceptors unaffected.5. Adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline were compared at two dose levels, in the presence or absence of effects on heart rate and force.6. Constrictor or dilator effects were found in the absence of other effects and were shown to depend to some extent on the rate of coronary perfusion.", 
    "6": "The changes in the pressor responses to angiotensin after treatment with substances known to modify sympathetic function have been compared with the changes in the responses to noradrenaline, tyramine and McN-A-343 using conscious cats. The responses to angiotensin were not reduced by blockade of adrenergic neurones, alpha and beta-adrenoceptors, or of autonomic ganglia. In conscious cats the acute pressor response to angiotensin does not appear to be related directly to stimulation or facilitation of transmission in sympathetic ganglia or to release of catecholamines from tissue stores.", 
    "7": "1. The blood pressure response to ranatensin, an undecapeptide from the skin of the frog, Rana pipiens, has been studied in various experimental animals.2. Ranatensin raised blood pressure in the dog and rabbit. The response was not altered by atropine, phentolamine, propranolol or hexamethonium, suggesting a direct peripheral vasoconstrictor action. In both animals ranatensin was about one-tenth as potent as angiotensin. Tachyphylaxis to ranatensin did occur, but there was no cross-tachyphylaxis with angiotensin, bradykinin, or noradrenaline.3. The peptide lowered blood pressure in the monkey, being as potent as eledoisin. The response was not altered by atropine, phentolamine, propranolol, tripelennamine, tetraethylammonium, bretylium, or methysergide. This again suggests a direct peripheral action on vascular smooth muscle. There was no tachyphylaxis to the depressor action, nor was there cross-tachyphylaxis with angiotensin, eledoisin, bradykinin, or noradrenaline.4. Ranatensin did not alter the blood pressure in cats and had a variable action in the guinea-pig with a rapid onset of tachyphylaxis.5. Ranatensin has a variable effect on the blood pressure in the rat that is related to the basal level of blood pressure. When the blood pressure is high, the response to the peptide is hypotension. Ranatensin raises blood pressure in the rat when the basal blood pressure is low. The pressor response to ranatensin appears to be due, in part, to the release of noradrenaline from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings.6. The composite action of ranatensin on blood pressure of various experimental animals is unlike that of any other peptide. Its hypertensive action in the dog or rabbit, together with a potent hypotensive action in the monkey, readily distinguishes it from all other vasoactive peptides."
