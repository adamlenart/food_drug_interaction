    "0": "1-Acetamino-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-2-propanol (AcNDP) detected in human urine was formed as a metabolite of propranolol (PL) via 1-amino-3-(L-naphthyloxy)-2-propanol (N-desisopropylpropranolol, NDP). The excreted amount of AcNDP was determined by GC-MS using an isotope dilution method. More than 40% of total AcNDP in 24 h urine was detected 10 h after the oral administration of PL to two volunteers, and the total amounts during 24 h urine were at least 1.9-3.9% of the PL dose. As AcNDP is an intermediate metabolite of PL, its urinary amount cannot be determined exactly. Incidentally, AcNDP was chemically stable and was not formed from NDP when acetyl CoA was added to the inactivated hepatocyte system. Thus, the acetylation of NDP, an aliphatic primary amine, was confirmed to be catalyzed by N-acetyltransferase, and interestingly, the acetyl conjugation was inhibited not by sulfamethazine but by p-amino benzoic acid.", 
    "1": "beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor ligand activity has been shown to be down-regulated in failing myocardium. It is the aim of this study to test the hypothesis that also mRNA levels are down-regulated in dilated cardiomyopathy. beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor ligand activities and mRNA expressions were analyzed in left ventricular biopsies from six organ donor hearts, in papillary muscles from seven patients operated on for mitral regurgitation, and in six explanted hearts as the result of dilated cardiomyophathy. mRNA levels were determined by solution hybridization. beta 1 ligand activity was decreased in the cases of mitral regurgitation (p < 0.01) and dilated cardiomyopathy (p < 0.001). beta 2 ligand activity did not differ between the three groups. mRNA expression was depressed in mitral regurgitation regarding both beta 1 (p < 0.001) and beta 2 (p < 0.01), while no differences were observed in dilated cardiomyopathy as compared to the donor hearts. The regulation of beta 1 and beta 2 adrenoceptor ligand activity and mRNA expression appears to follow a specific pattern in dilated cardiomyopathy. The specific down-regulation of beta 1 ligand activity seems to occur at a posttranslational level.", 
    "2": "The stereochemical characteristics of the hydrolysis of several ester-type prodrugs of propranolol, O-acetyl, O-propionyl, O-butyryl, O-pivaloyl and succinyl esters, were studied in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), rat plasma and rat tissue homogenates. In phosphate buffer, no differences were observed in the hydrolysis rate between the esters of (R)- and (S)-propranolol. The effects of the ester moieties on the hydrolysis rate in phosphate buffer were in the following order: acetate > propionate > butyrate > succinate > pivalate. In rat plasma and tissue homogenates, the hydrolysis of the esters was accelerated, and stereoselective hydrolysis was observed. In plasma, the hydrolysis of the (R)-isomer was faster than that of the (S)-isomer except for the succinate ester. On the other hand, in the liver and intestine homogenates, the (S)-isomer was hydrolyzed faster than the (R)-isomer except for the succinate and pivalate esters in the liver homogenate. Also, the ratio of the hydrolysis rates (S/R) changed with the type of prodrug. As the length of the alkyl chain of the ester increased, the S/R ratio approached unity in liver and intestine homogenates but stayed almost constant in plasma. For the pivalate ester, stereoselective hydrolysis was observed in plasma and intestine homogenate but not in liver homogenate. The stereoselective hydrolysis of the succinate ester was observed only in intestine homogenate, but the S/R ratio was almost 1 in plasma, liver and intestine homogenates. No interconversion between (R)- and (S)-isomer was observed during the hydrolysis of any of the ester prodrugs. These results indicate that hydrolysis of ester-type prodrugs of propranolol occurs stereoselectively in rat tissues, and that its selectivity is dependent on the kind of tissue and prodrug.", 
    "3": "Newborn rats delivered by cesarean section were given subcutaneously propranolol (PRO), a beta-adrenergic blocker, (1) immediately or (2) 180 min after delivery. The diameter of the ductus arteriosus (DA) of the newborn pups was calibrated at 30, 60 and 90 min after the PRO-administration. The results were as follows: (1) the DA calibers of the pups given 0.2, 1.0., 5.0 mg/kg PRO immediately after cesarean delivery remained significantly larger than those of controls in a dose-dependent manner for 30 min after treatment. In the 5 mg/kg group, the enlargement of the DA was prolonged for 90 min after treatment. (2) In untreated pups, the DA completely closed by 180 min after cesarean delivery. The DA was not affected by the administration of 5 mg/kg PRO at 3 hr after delivery. It was concluded that, PRO inhibits the spontaneous constriction of the DA, suggesting an important role of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the spontaneous closure of the DA in newborn rats.", 
    "4": "To determine whether impaired reflex control of heart rate was evident in rats of the inbred Dahl hypertension-sensitive (SS/Jr) strains.", 
    "5": "Phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside were administered through jugular catheters in graded doses to elicit a range of pressor and depressor responses, for which corresponding reflex decreases and increases in heart rate were recorded. To assess the relative contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of autonomic control to baroreflex functioning, atropine methyl nitrate and atenolol were administered to establish vagal blockade, and cardiac sympathetic blockade, respectively.", 
    "6": "Assuming a sigmoidal relationship between mean arterial pressure and heart rate changes, our results indicated that SS/Jr rats exhibited elevated blood pressure set-points for baroreceptor activation and roughly similar baroreflex sensitivity compared with SR/Jr rats. In contrast, using linear regression analyses, our results indicated that SS/Jr rats had significant reductions in baroreceptor sensitivity when arterial pressure was increased by phenylephrine. Baroreceptor sensitivity was similar between rats of the two strains when arterial pressure was reduced by administration of nitroprusside. Atropine and atenolol had similar effects on baroreflex control of heart rate in both strains. However, pressor responses to phenylephrine were significantly greater in SS/Jr rats, an effect which had previously been reported in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats and attributed to deficits in autonomic reflex control of vascular resistance.", 
    "7": "The present results indicate that the method of analysis for determination of baroreceptor sensitivity can influence the conclusions drawn in studies of hypertensive and normotensive strains of rat. Although deficits in baroreflex control of heart rate have consistently been reported in DS rats, the present results did not confirm those findings in inbred Dahl rats when mean arterial pressure and heart rate change data were analyzed by fitting a logistic equation to sigmoid data. In contrast, using linear regression analysis, those same data did reveal a defect in baroreceptor sensitivity of SS/Jr rats after acute increases in arterial pressure. Caution should be exercised in the selection of a method for analysis of baroreceptor data and the interpretation of the findings.", 
    "8": "Effects of centrally administered rat atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP1-28) in different doses (50, 100, 150, 200, 500 or 1000 ng) were examined in rats with respect to anxiolytic properties in an elevated plus-maze model. In doses of 100, 150 and 200 ng, ANP1-28 abolished the normal preference for the closed arms of the maze, and increased the percentage of time spent on the open arms; this is consistent with an 'anxiolytic-like' effect. Doses of 50, 500 and 1000 ng of rANP1-28 produced no behavioral effects in the elevated plus-maze model. Pretreatment with a dopaminergic blocker, an alpha-adrenoreceptor or a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist antagonized the effect of 200 ng ANP1-28 in the elevated plus-maze test. A muscarinergic cholinergic blocker, a GABA receptor antagonist, a 5-HT receptor antagonist and an opiate antagonist were not able to modulate the 'anxiolytic-like' effects of ANP1-28. These results suggest that a multiple neurotransmitter system activation might be responsible for the ANP1-28-induced 'anxiolytic-like' activity.", 
    "9": "The hydroalcoholic extract of Phyllanthus urinaria (Euphorbiaceae), substance P and substance P methyl ester all caused graded contractions in the guinea-pig urinary bladder. Responses to hydroalcoholic extract and substance P were markedly inhibited in calcium-free Krebs solution, this effect being reversed by reintroduction of calcium in the medium. The contraction in response to hydroalcoholic extract was unaffected by atropine, propranolol, prazosin, yohimbine, tetrodotoxin, w-conotoxin, nicardipine, HOE 140, guanethidine, staurosporine, phorbol ester or indomethacin, excluding the involvement of nervous mediated responses, or action via cholinergic, adrenergic, kinins, cyclo-oxygenase metabolites, protein kinase C or activation of L or N-type calcium channels. The selective NK1 tachykinin antagonist (FK 888), but not NK2 (SR 48968) antagonized substance P-induced contraction, but both drugs failed to effect Phyllanthus urinaria-induced contraction. Prolonged desensitization of guinea pig urinary bladder with capsaicin (10 microM) or preincubation of guinea-pig urinary bladder with capsazepine did not affect contraction caused by hydroalcoholic extract. Ruthenium red almost completely abolished capsaicin-induced contraction, but had no effect on hydroalcoholic extract-mediated contraction. Substance P and the hydroalcoholic extract caused marked potentiation of the twitch response in the preparations field stimulated. The facilitatory effect of substance P, but not that of hydroalcoholic extract, was prevented by the NK1 (FK 888), but not by NK2 (SR 48968) antagonist. We concluded that contraction induced by hydroalcoholic extract of Phyllanthus urinaria in the guinea pig urinary bladder involves direct action on smooth muscle and relies on the mobilization of extracellular calcium influx unrelated to activation of L- and N-type calcium channels or activation of protein kinase C mechanisms. In addition contraction caused by the hydroalcoholic extract of Phyllanthus urinaria in guinea-pig urinary bladder does not involve the activation of tachykinin or vanilloid receptors.", 
    "10": "The present study was designed to investigate the role of central adrenoceptors in the hypotensive effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of norepinephrine (NE) in conscious rabbits. Experiments were carried out on 19 adult rabbits (oryctolagus cuniculus) of either sex. A dose-dependent hypotensive response to ICV injection of NE was observed with no significant change in heart rate. The hypotensive response of NE was blocked 74.2 +/- 0.7% by yohimbine (alpha-2 adrenergic blocker), and 25.0 +/- 0.5% by metoprolol (beta-1 adrenergic blocker). NE response was not affected either by prazosin or butoxamine (alpha-1 and beta-2 adrenergic blockers respectively). The results suggest that the dose-dependent hypotensive response of ICV administered NE is mediated through alpha-2 and beta-1 central adrenoceptors.", 
    "11": "To evaluate the short-term effects of intravenously given atenolol and pindolol on utero- and umbilicoplacental vascular impedance, fetal hemodynamics and cardiac function in patients suffering from pregnancy-induced hypertension.", 
    "12": "A total of 24 women were randomized to receive atenolol or pindolol infusion. By using pulsed color Doppler techniques, uterine, placental arcuate, umbilical fetal middle cerebral and renal arteries were examined before, at the end and 30 min after the end of infusion. Pulsatility indices (PI) were calculated to assess vascular impedance. Fetal myocardial function was evaluated by using pulsed Doppler and M-mode echocardiography. Peak systolic velocities from the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk, and also inner diameters and fractional shortenings of both ventricles were measured.", 
    "13": "Both drugs significantly decreased maternal blood pressure. Immediately after the infusion, maternal heart rate was significantly decreased in both groups; but the decrease was clearer and lasted longer in the atenolol group. Pindolol caused no changes in utero- or umbilicoplacental vascular impedance, while atenolol increased it in the nonplacental uterine artery. After atenolol infusion, PI in the umbilical artery was higher than after pindolol. Pindolol had no effects on fetal hemodynamics, while atenolol decreased PI value in the fetal renal artery. Peak systolic velocity in the pulmonary trunk was decreased after atenolol. Pindolol did not affect the fetal cardiac function. In subgroups with originally increased utero- or umbilicoplacental vascular impedance, the responses in uterine and umbilical vascular impedance and in fetal hemodynamics and cardiac function after atenolol and pindolol were different compared to whole groups.", 
    "14": "Differently acting antihypertensive agents seem to affect differently uteroplacental vascular impedance. Atenolol may have some direct effects on fetal hemodynamics and cardiac function. According to our results, pindolol seems to be more preferable in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension than atenolol.", 
    "15": "The effect of total alkaloid extracted from Peganum harmala seeds collected in Egypt on body temperature was studied in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of the Peganum harmala extract produced significant and dose-dependent hypothermia. Similarly, harmine and harmaline, major constituents of the harmala alkaloid, lowered the body temperature. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (100 mg/kg/day for 3 days), a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, significantly attenuated the hypothermic effect of the total alkaloid and harmine, while it tended to block the hypothermic action of harmaline. Methysergide (2 mg/kg), a 5-HT antagonist, significantly attenuated the hypothermia induced by harmala alkaloids. Pindolol (0.05-2 mg/kg), a 5-HT1A receptor and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, partly blocked the hypothermic effect of the harmala alkaloids in a dose-dependent manner, whereas propranolol (10 mg/kg), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, failed to alter it, suggesting that beta-adrenoceptor is not involved in the hypothermia caused by the alkaloids. Pretreatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol (5 mg/kg, s.c. and 2 mg/kg, i.p. 24 and 2 h before the experiment, respectively) significantly attenuated the hypothermic effect of harmala alkaloids. Moreover, in haloperidol pretreated rats, methysergide (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and pindolol (0.05 and 2 mg/kg) completely attenuated the hypothermic effect of the alkaloids. These data suggest that harmala alkaloids produce hypothermic effect mainly through endogenous 5-HT stimulation of 5-HT1A receptor.", 
    "16": "Mechanisms of tryptophan (a 5-HT precursor)-induced changes in body temperature were investigated in rats pretreated with pargyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I). Tryptophan (100 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect the body temperature in rats, but it produced significant hypothermia followed by marked hyperthermia and higher mortality in the pargyline-pretreated rats. 5-HT depletion with p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA, 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days) significantly suppressed not only the body temperature change but also the mortality and 5-HT syndrome following tryptophan plus pargyline administration. Although propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not alter the hypothermia caused by tryptophan in the pargyline-pretreated rats, pindolol (2 mg/kg, S.C.), a 5-HT1A receptor and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, suppressed the hypothermia but not the hyperthermia or mortality caused by the same treatment. On the other hand, spiperone and ketanserin, 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, at doses of 3 mg/kg, potentiated the hypothermia and completely suppressed the hyperthermia and mortality caused by tryptophan in the pargyline-pretreated rats. These results suggest that tryptophan-induced hypo- and hyperthermia are mediated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors, respectively, in the pargyline-pretreated pretreated rats.", 
    "17": "The effects of partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists buspirone (0.010-4.0 mg/kg), ipsapirone (0.010-6.0 mg/kg), and gepirone (0.025-4.0 mg/kg) on sleep and waking were studied in vehicle-treated and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT)-injected rats. 5,7-DHT-treated animals showed a marked and significant serotonin and 5-HIAA depletion in the raphe regions of the pons and upper brain stem, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Subcutaneous administration of the partial agonists to both the vehicle-infused and the 5,7-DHT-treated animals significantly increased waking (W) and reduced light sleep (LS), slow-wave sleep (SWS), and REM sleep (REMS). Pretreatment with (-)pindolol (2.0 mg/kg) reversed the effects of buspirone and gepirone on W and non-REM sleep (LS + SWS) whereas REMS remained suppressed. (-)-Pindolol failed to reverse the effects of ipsapirone on sleep and W. The present results tend to indicate that increased W after acute administration of buspirone, ipsapirone, or gepirone depends upon the activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The well-known anxiolytic action observed after chronic administration of the azapirones seems to be related to mechanisms other that these involved in their stimulant effect.", 
    "18": "Loss of adrenergic hypoglycaemic symptoms is the most distinctive feature in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness. Previous reports from in vivo studies show reduced heart rate responsiveness both to adrenergic agonists and antagonists in these patients. This study was carried out to investigate whether the reduced adrenergic sensitivity in IDDM patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness (IDDM-unaware) also could be demonstrated as reduced increase in cAMP production in mononuclear leucocytes induced by isoprenaline stimulation, or reduced inhibition by ICI-118551 (a selective beta 2-adrenergic receptor blocker) of isoprenaline induced cAMP production. We found that the slope of the concentration-response curves of isoprenaline/cAMP and the maximal cAMP concentrations obtained after isoprenaline stimulation were reduced in IDDM-unaware compared to control and IDDM patients with normal hypoglycaemia awareness (IDDM-aware). We did not find any significant differences in the response to ICI-118551 between control, IDDM-aware and IDDM-unaware. This study supports the reports of reduced sensitivity of adrenergic agonists as a part of the pathophysiological changes in hypoglycaemia unawareness, but we have not been able to confirm the reports of an association between hypoglycaemia unawareness and reduced effect of adrenergic antagonists.", 
    "19": "A new approach to antiviral therapy is proposed, taking advantage of the recently investigated innervation of immune tissues by the sympathetic nervous system, which establishes a functional connection between the nervous and the immune system, where the sympathetic nervous system exerts a varying tonic inhibitory influence on cellular activation via secretion of norepinephrine and reception thereof by beta-receptors on leukocytes. Simultaneous beta-adrenergic blockade of leukocytes and stress-related centres of the central nervous system (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus) is suggested as immunoactivating therapy in presence of foreign antigen. Immunoactivation is newly defined as facilitated activation of the immune system in presence of foreign antigen and is theoretically correlated with indirect antiviral and antitumoral activity.", 
    "20": "Many types of chloride current have been reported in the hearts of various species; however, the nature of chloride conductance in the human heart is still unclear. We investigated cyclic AMP-dependent chloride current and swelling-induced chloride current in isolated human atrial cells using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method. External application of 1 microM isoprenaline increased calcium current by 391.9 +/- 48.6% (mean +/- S.D., n = 8); however, there was no activation of cyclic AMP-dependent chloride current at steady-state membrane potentials between -80 and +50 mV. Neither external application of 10 microM forskolin nor internal application of 50 microM cyclic AMP activated a cyclic AMP-dependent chloride current. On the other hand, when the same cell was superfused with a 50% hypotonic solution, it exhibited osmotic swelling and an outward rectifying current (6.59 +/- 0.96 pA/pF at +30 mV, n = 10). This swelling-induced current reversed at -26.5 +/- 3.1 mV (n = 10), close to the calculated equilibrium potential for chloride, and it was sensitive to the stilbene-derivative chloride channel blocker. In conclusion, no activation of cyclic AMP-dependent chloride current was observed in human atrial cells. On the other hand, a swelling-induced chloride current was consistently demonstrated and its kinetic properties were similar to those reported in other cardiac myocytes.", 
    "21": "Ca(2+)-channel blockers at therapeutic concentrations were shown to modulate several processes underlying inflammation, such as growth factor-mediated activation of genes coding for the low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (Block et al., 1991), and for interleukins in human mesangial cells (Roth et al., 1992). Two Ca(2+)-channel blockers, Manidipine (Roth et al., 1992) and Verapamil (Walz et al., 1990) have been shown to induce the expression of the gene coding for interleukin-6 (IL-6). Here we demonstrate that the four Ca(2+)-channel blockers, Amlodipine, Felodipine, Isradipine and Manidipine, at nanomolar concentrations, activate the transcription of the genes encoding IL-6 and IL-8 in primary human VSMC and fibroblasts. Ca(2+)-channel blocker-induced transcription is subsequently followed by secretion of the two ILs into the growth medium of the cells. In addition, we compared the action of the Ca(2+)-channel blockers with that of propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, or with furosemide, a diuretic, all of which are known to lower blood pressure. However, in contrast to the dihydropyridines, the two latter drugs failed to affect the expression of the two IL genes.", 
    "22": "Lactating Holstein cows were used to assess the effect of bovine somatotropin (bST; n = 8) and fasting (FAST; n = 4) on ligand binding to beta-adrenergic (BAR) and Type-1 adenosine (A1R) receptors in adipose tissue. Cows received exogenous bST (sometribove; 40 mg/d) or no hormone (control) for 4 d in a single-reversal design with a 7-d interval between treatment periods. Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were taken on day 4 of each treatment. Eight d after the bST regimen, 4 cows were fasted for 3 d and adipose biopsies were taken. Ligand binding was quantified with a postnuclear, total adipose tissue membrane preparation (100,000 x g pellet). Binding to BAR and A1R was assessed with the antagonists [125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICP) and [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DCPCX), respectively. The binding affinity (Kd) of BAR for ICP was not affected by bST but was enhanced by FAST; maximal binding (Bmax) was increased with bST treatment (P < 0.06) and reduced by FAST (61%, P < 0.01). Kd values for DCPCX binding to A1R were not changed by bST or FAST. bST did not affect Bmax for A1R; however, FAST reduced the Bmax by 38%. Data highlight the differential regulation of BAR and A1R by bST and FAST.", 
    "23": "Transverse limb defects are reported in a fetus and an infant born to mothers on treatment for hypertension. One pregnancy resulted in an intrauterine death at 20 weeks, and in addition to the limb defects, there was bilateral cleft lip and palate and renal hypoxic damage. It is proposed that the drugs caused maternal hypotension which led to reduced uteroplacental blood flow, fetal hypotension and hypoxia and that the anomalies seen in the two babies are a consequence of these events.", 
    "24": "The most important clinical manifestation of myocarditis is congestive heart failure. The precise mechanisms of heart failure during myocarditis have not been elucidated because no animal model that would permit in vivo study of hemodynamics in severe active myocarditis has been available. We monitored hemodynamics and left ventricular function in a rat model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis to determine if this model could be useful for the study of in vivo hemodynamics in severe active myocarditis. Lewis rats were immunized with human cardiac myosin suspended in complete Freund's adjuvant. Baseline hemodynamics were measured using an ultraminiature catheter pressure transducer via the right internal carotid artery, 4 weeks after immunization in one group of rats (acute phase) and 3 months after immunization in another group (chronic phase). Untreated rats served as the control group. Hemodynamic measurements were also obtained after infusion of dobutamine in the acute-phase and chronic-phase groups. The heart weight-to-body weight ratios were significantly higher in both the acute-phase group and the chronic-phase group compared with normal control rats. The baseline left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly lower in the chronic phase group than in the control group. Peak dP/dt and peak -dP/dt were significantly lower in both the acute-phase group and the chronic-phase group compared with the control group. Dobutamine significantly increased left ventricular systolic pressure, peak dP/dt, and peak -dP/dt in the chronic-phase group but caused only minor changes in hemodynamic variables in the acute-phase group. In vivo measurements of hemodynamic variables indicated the presence of left ventricular dysfunction in rats with experimental autoimmune myocarditis. This animal model may be useful for the study of both acute heart failure related to acute myocarditis and chronic heart failure due to diffuse myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "25": "Calcium entry through L-type calcium channels is essential for contraction of both arterial smooth muscle and the myocardium, and is important in cardiac conduction. First-generation calcium entry blockers lack or have a modest degree of vascular selectivity and inhibit cardiac function at doses producing therapeutic arterial dilatation. Such agents may cause deterioration in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and their combination with a beta-adrenergic blocker may adversely affect cardiac contractility and conduction. Development of newer agents has focused on obtaining a higher degree of vascular selectivity. Felodipine is a highly vascular selective calcium entry blocker, with a vascular selectivity ratio greater than 100, as shown experimentally. Isradipine and nicardipine are also vascularly selective calcium entry blockers. Hemodynamic studies in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or in patients receiving beta-adrenergic blockade, show that felodipine can produce profound arteriolar dilatation without the negative effects of left ventricular systolic performance. Furthermore, felodipine alone or when added to a beta-adrenergic blocker does not interfere with cardiac conduction. The primary mechanism that accounts for the efficacy of dihydropyridine calcium entry blockers in hypertension and angina pectoris is arterial dilation, whereas nondihydropyridines may also derive part of their effect from inhibition of cardiac performance. As some of these patients, most commonly the elderly, have concomitant left ventricular dysfunction, it should be advantageous to avoid myocardial depression in the treatment of their primary disease. Preliminary studies in patients with heart failure indicate that felodipine and amlopidine may improve hemodynamics, reduce neurohormonal activation, and increase exercise tolerance, but final conclusions must await the randomized clinical trials now underway.", 
    "26": "Previous animal experiments suggest that the increase in the amplitude from the R-wave to the S-wave (RSh) may be more sensitive than other ECG measures to sodium channel blocking drug actions. We measured RSh of three orthogonal leads at baseline and during intravenous pharmacologic stimulation with adenosine, ajmaline, atropine, disopyramide, isoproterenol, lidocaine, norepinephrine (NE), propranolol, and verapamil in an observer-blinded placebo-controlled study in healthy young men. The short-term reproducibility of RSh was high. Ajmaline increased RSh in the anteroposterior lead, disopyramide in the anteroposterior and vertical lead, and lidocaine in the vertical and horizontal lead, respectively. Isoproterenol increased RSh in the anteroposterior lead; atropine decreased RSh in the vertical lead. The other drugs did not affect RSh significantly. Our data do not support the concept that RSh measure is a more sensitive technique for assessing class I antiarrhythmic drug action in humans, at least in healthy subjects. In addition, our results indicate that changes in autonomic tone may influence RSh measurements.", 
    "27": "The efficacy of sotalol in the treatment of sustained ventricular arrhythmias has been proved; however, whether its antiarrhythmic effect is due to a beta-blocking activity, a class III antiarrhythmic activity, or a combination of both is not known. We conducted a prospective randomized study to compare the effects of metoprolol, a \"pure\" beta-blocking agent, and of sotalol, a beta-blocking agent with additional class III antiarrhythmic properties, in 34 consecutive patients with documented sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) unrelated to transient causes. After undergoing baseline programmed electrical stimulation (PES-1) to assess arrhythmia inducibility, the patients were randomly assigned to a (double-blind) treatment of either metoprolol (16 patients) or sotalol (18 patients). Before the chronic regimen was initiated, arrhythmia inducibility was reassessed after the intravenous administration of either 0.15 mg/kg metoprolol or 1.5 mg/kg sotalol (PES-2), according to drug assignment. During the chronic oral regimen, a third PES (PES-3) was performed after a median follow-up of 72 days. Resting and exercise ECG, Holter monitoring and echocardiography were performed at baseline and during follow-up. During a 2-year follow-up, a non-fatal arrhythmia recurred in 1 patient of the metoprolol arm and in 5 patients of the sotalol arm; 1 patient in the latter group died suddenly 2 months after the recurrence, while receiving amiodarone therapy. Intention-to-treat analysis showed no difference in the incidence of arrhythmia recurrence, sudden death, or total mortality between the two groups. During PES-1, a sustained ventricular arrhythmia was inducible in 18 of 34 patients (53%), 8 in the metoprolol and 10 in the sotalol arm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "We compared the ability of a new amiodarone-like agent, SR 33589, with that of amiodarone, D,L-sotalol, and lignocaine to reduce the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and associated arrhythmias caused by acute coronary artery occlusion in anesthetized pigs. Ischemia was induced by occlusion of the left coronary descending artery (LAD) for 30 min. Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF) were recorded during coronary occlusion. SR 33589 (1.25, 2.50, and 5 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) markedly reduced the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias during ischemia. The incidence of VF was reduced from 90% in the control group to 30% (p < 0.05) with 1.25 mg/kg, to 10% (p < 0.001) with 2.50 mg/kg, and to 20% (p < 0.01) with 5 mg/kg. In addition, SR 33589, especially at the two higher doses, caused a sustained reduction in both the incidence of VT and the number of PVCs per minute. In comparison, amiodarone 10 and 20 mg/kg i.v. reduced the incidence of VF (40 and 50%, respectively), but these reductions never reached a level of statistical significance. The incidence of VT and the number of PVCs per minute were also decreased significantly by amiodarone. D,L-sotalol 3 mg/kg i.v. exerted significant anti-arrhythmic activity; the incidence of VF was reduced 20% (p < 0.01), and both the incidence of VT and number of PVC per minute were also reduced. In contrast, lignocaine given as a 2-mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion at 70 micrograms/kg/min had no antiarrhythmic or antifibrillatory activity in this preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "29": "To clarify the controversy concerning the role of catecholaminergic systems in regulating hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) secretion, we assessed the direct effects of norepinephrine and epinephrine, alone and in association with mixed alpha and beta antagonists on hypothalamic CRF secretion. An in vitro rat mediobasal hypothalamus perifusion system was used, in which CRF secretion from a single explant was evaluated by a specific radioimmunoassay. We found that norepinephrine stimulated CRF secretion, with peak effects at 10(-8) M concentration, whereas epinephrine had no effect on CRF secretion. The effect of norepinephrine was antagonised by the mixed alpha antagonist phentolamine and by the mixed beta antagonist propranolol. We conclude that norepinephrine, but not epinephrine, stimulate hypothamic CRF secretion via alpha and beta receptors. The data support the idea that the central noradrenergic systems are excitatory upon CRF-41 secretion when acting directly at the hypothalamic level.", 
    "30": "1. Calcium signalling by acetylcholine (ACh) in single rat pancreatic beta-cells was studied. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by dual-wavelength fura-2 microfluorometry. 2. In the presence of basal glucose (2.8 mM), 10(-6) to 10(-4) M ACh (high ACh) transiently increased [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i response to 10(-5) M ACh was little altered under Ca(2+)-free conditions. Brief pulses of 10(-5) M ACh evoked successive [Ca2+]i responses, which were progressively inhibited by 0.2-0.5 microM thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pump. 3. Elevation of glucose to 8.3 mM, a concentration which stimulates insulin release, increased [Ca2+]i to an initial peak followed by a sustained, moderate elevation. Addition of 10(-8) to 10(-7) M ACh (low ACh) evoked a further increase in [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i response to 10(-7) M ACh was completely inhibited under Ca(2+)-free conditions by 1 microM nitrendipine, a blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels, and by 100 microM diazoxide, an opener of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. 4. In the presence of 8.3 mM glucose, [Ca2+]i responses to 10(-5) M ACh were reduced but not abolished by Ca(2+)-free conditions, nitrendipine and diazoxide. Successive [Ca2+]i transients induced by 10(-5) M ACh pulses in the presence of nitrendipine were progressively inhibited by thapsigargin. 5. The results revealed two distinct modes of Ca2+ signalling: low ACh increases [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels only in the beta-cells in which glucose has already elevated [Ca2+]i, while high ACh increases [Ca2+]i at basal as well as stimulatory glucose concentrations by releasing Ca2+ from the ER. The former mechanism is likely to relate to the potentiator action and the latter to the initiator action of ACh on insulin release. High ACh and elevated glucose provoke both modes of Ca2+ signalling.", 
    "31": "1. Effects of ionophoretic administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and selective 5-HT1A receptor agonists and antagonists on identified dorsal vagal preganglionic and dorsal raphe neurones were studied in pentobarbitone sodium or chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rats, respectively. 2. Extracellular recordings were made from 176 preganglionic neurones in the dorsal vagal nucleus (DVN). Application of 5-HT at low currents (< or = 10 nA) increased the activity of these neurones. However, at increased currents (10-60 nA), it had a predominantly depressant effect. Application of selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, (+/-)-pindolol or WAY-100635, attenuated the excitatory responses evoked by 5-HT. 3. Ionophoresis of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (5-30 nA) increased the firing rate of 19 and decreased that of 67 of the 104 vagal neurones tested. Other 5-HT1A receptor agonists, flesinoxan and N,N-di-n-propyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine (DP-5-CT) also had predominantly depressant effects. 4. (+/-)-Pindolol attenuated excitations but not inhibitions evoked by 8-OH-DPAT. Surprisingly, WAY-100635 and 8-OH-DPAT produced the same effect on these neurones and when applied together, WAY-100635 failed to attenuate the 8-OH-DPAT responses. 5. Dorsal raphe neurones were identified by their low, regular firing rate and their subsequent histological localization. 8-OH-DPAT reversibly reduced the activity in all 7 neurones tested and this was antagonized by WAY-100635 in all 3 neurones tested. 6. In conclusion, 5-HT applied to vagal preganglionic neurones evokes excitatory and inhibitory responses. The excitatory, but not the inhibitory responses may be mediated, at least in part, by activation of 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "32": "1. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of endogenous bradykinin to the vascular sympathoinhibitory effects exerted by angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). 2. Adult SHRs were treated daily for 8 days with either perindopril (3 mg kg-1), or a selective angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, losartan (10 mg kg-1) both given orally--these two doses being equipotent in inhibiting angiotensin I (AI)-induced vascular responses--or distilled water (controls). After pithing, the animals were instrumented for determination of blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac output, regional (renal, mesenteric, hindlimb) blood flows (pulsed Doppler technique) and corresponding vascular resistances. Afterwards, half of the animals of each group were given the selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist, icatibant, used in a dose (10 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) that achieved B2 receptor blockade, the other half received saline (10 microliters kg-1, i.v.). Haemodynamic responses to increasing frequencies of spinal cord stimulation were then measured. 3. Pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to AI were significantly and similarly reduced in both perindopril- and losartan-treated groups. Perindopril and losartan both decreased to a similar extent the pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. 4. In the dose used, icatibant did not affect any of the investigated haemodynamic parameters in any of the experimental groups. Furthermore, icatibant did not affect the stimulation frequency-response curves in the control animals and did not modify the vascular sympathoinhibitory effects exerted by perindopril and by losartan. 5 Taken together, these results demonstrate that endogenous bradykinin does not, through B2 receptor activation, contribute to the vascular sympathoinhibitory effects of ACEIs in SHRs.", 
    "33": "We administered potassium iodide and propylthiouracil per rectum, in conjunction with intravenous dexamethasone and propranolol, for emergent treatment of a patient in thyroid storm with small bowel obstruction. Shortly after initiation of this treatment, the patient successfully underwent two emergent surgical procedures for resection of an intestinal volvulus with advanced peritonitis. Serum levels of iodide and propylthiouracil showed substantial absorption of these drugs via the rectal route. Measurement of 24-h urinary-free iodide indicated that the bioavailability of potassium iodide delivered by retention enema was at least 40%. Parenteral iodide preparations have been unavailable in the past, and continue to be difficult to obtain emergently. Rectal administration of inorganic iodide is an effective, readily available and less expensive alternative to parenteral sodium iodide for patients in thyroid storm with upper gastrointestinal tract dysfunction.", 
    "34": "Up to the present the relationship between arterial hypertension or its treatment and cardiovascular complications has been evaluated in terms of the incidence of events, such as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke and cardiac deaths. However, cardiovascular events are not the direct consequence of blood pressure elevation, which, on the contrary, is responsible for atherosclerotic disease. Quantitative ultrasonography is a sensitive, specific and reproducible technique which, in comparison to arteriography, is non invasive and less expensive. The availability of this technique has allowed us to do some studies, one just published, another in the elaboration phase and others ongoing, aimed at evaluating the effects of antihypertensive agents on carotid changes in hypertensive patients. The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) compares the effects of lacidipine, a calcium-antagonist and of atenolol, a beta-blocker, on blood pressure, on carotid vessel modifications, and on the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with mild to moderate hypertension with a 4-year follow-up period. Preliminary results of the study, which were concerned with the demographic characteristics of the first 1000 randomized patients enrolled, indicate that 84% of the patients had a carotid plaque, 15% had thickening of the intima-media, and 1% had a normal vessel. These results are both surprising and significant in that they admonish the physician not to neglect patients with mild to moderate hypertension even when they have neither complications nor other risk factors.",

Symptoms of this nature, which can include frightening hallucinations or anxiety of phobic proportions, are subjectively distressing and can lead both to unsafe or violent situations as well as to the preventable use of inappropriate medication, physical restraint, and frequently to institutionalization. These psychopathologic manifestations of dementia often prove to be a burden on family, caregivers, and the health care system as well. This article presents an overview of the assessment and management of agitation as it relates to the severity of dementia symptoms and cognitive deterioration.

    "36": "1. We have assessed the interaction of the antimalarial halofantrine with cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes in vitro, with the use of microsomes from human liver and recombinant cell lines. 2. Rac-halofantrine was a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 1.06 microM, Ki = 4.3 microM) of the 1-hydroxylation of bufuralol, a marker for CYP2D6 activity. Of a group of structurally related antimalarials tested, only quinidine (IC50 = 0.04 microM) was more potent. 3. Microsomes prepared from recombinant CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 cell lines were shown to catalyse halofantrine N-debutylation. 4. The metabolism of halofantrine to its N-desbutyl metabolite by human liver microsomes showed no correlation with CYP2D6 genotypic or phenotypic status and there was no consistent inhibition by quinidine. 5. The rate of halofantrine metabolism showed a significant correlation with both CYP3A4 protein levels (r = 0.88, P = 0.01) and the rate of felodipine metabolism (r = 0.86, P = 0.013), a marker substrate for CYP3A4 activity. Inhibition studies showed that ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of halofantrine metabolism (IC50 = 1.57 microM). 6. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that halofantrine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and can also be metabolised by the enzyme. However, in human liver microsomes it appears to be metabolised largely by CYP3A4.",

In general, there was good agreement between the SBP/DBP-measurements based on auscultatory Korotkoff-I- and IV-criteria and the reference method; the average method difference in estimating the isoprenaline responses for SBPa-SBPg was: -1.1, 95% CI: -5.4 to 3.1 mm Hg with a within-subject between-method repeatability coefficient (REP) of 11.6 mm Hg and for DBPa-IV-DBPg: 3.5, 95% CI: -0.5 to 6.5 mm Hg, REP: 11.5 mm Hg. The ausculatation of Korotkoff-V substantially overestimated the isoprenaline induced reduction of DBP: method difference DBPa-V-DBPg: -11.3, 95% CI: -17.8 to -4.7 mm Hg, REP: 31.8 mm Hg. 3. Oscillometry yielded good approximations for the SBP response to isoprenaline (average method difference SBPo-SBPg: -2.9, 95% CI: -9.0 to 3.3 mm Hg, REP: 17.6 mm Hg) but was poorly sensitive with regard to the DBP responses: method difference DBPo-DBPg: 6.5, 95% CI: -1.3 to 14.3 mm Hg, REP: 25.7 mm Hg. 4.

Data were obtained from 2,897 cases including 1,422 elderly (> or = 65 years old) and 1,475 non-elderly hypertensives (< 65 years old) collected from Sapporo Medical University Hospital and related medical facilities. In the total group of 2,879 cases, frequencies of use of hypotensive drugs were as follows: Ca antagonists, 76.3%, beta-blockers, 31.4%; ACE-inhibitors, 25.1%; diuretics, 18.1; alpha 1-blockers, 10.5%; potassium sparing diuretics, 8.8%. In the elderly group, beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors were used less frequently than in non-elderly hypertensives. On the contrary, diuretics were administered more frequently in elderly than in non-elderly subjects. Comparing the usage of hypotonics among different types of medical facilities, higher frequencies of use of beta-blockers and diuretics were observed in the university hospital than in general hospitals and private hospitals or clinics. ACE-inhibitors were used less frequently in private facilities than in the university hospital and general hospital. In summary, Ca antagonists were used most frequently in both non-elderly and elderly subjects, and in all three different types of medical facilities. Other hypotonics were used differently according to patients age. There was differences in the usage of drugs apart from Ca antagonists among the three different types of medical facilities.", 
    "39": "beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents impair endurance exercise performance in healthy subjects and in patients with hypertension. A possible explanation for the reduced exercise tolerance is a diminished availability of plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) for energy production during exercise. This study investigated the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on NEFA uptake of exercising skeletal muscle at elevated blood NEFA concentrations. In 11 healthy volunteers a triacylglycerol emulsion was infused at increasing rate for 1 hour before and 1 hour during one-armed cranking exercise at 60% Wpeak with and without prior administration of the beta 1+2-adrenoceptor blocking agent propranolol (80 mg per os). Arteriovenous concentration differences of NEFA across the active forearm were measured and forearm blood flow was estimated using venous occlusion plethysmography. Heart rate and blood flow were significantly lower after propranolol (p < 0.05). Propranolol did not affect arterial NEFA concentration, arteriovenous NEFA difference or NEFA flux significantly. Net NEFA uptake increased with increasing arterial NEFA concentration or inflow in a similar manner with and without prior propranolol administration. Therefore, the results do not support the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic activity plays a role in the regulation of active skeletal muscle NEFA uptake under the conditions studied.", 
    "40": "Antiarrhythmic drugs can and do induce unexpected and sometimes fatal reactions by either producing new symptomatic arrhythmias or by aggravating existing arrhythmias. The definition of proarrhythmia has changed since controlled clinical studies showed a dichotomy between arrhythmia suppression and mortality. The nature of proarrhythmic reactions is linked to the electrophysiologic effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs. Whereas Class I agents without accompanying effects on repolarization generally produce ventricular tachycardia (often incessant) or fibrillation, Class III agents typically produce torsades de pointes that may deteriorate into ventricular fibrillation. The precise mechanism of torsades de pointes is not fully elucidated, although early after-depolarization and increases in spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization are likely possibilities. Proarrhythmic risk is lowest for amiodarone and is probably related to the drug's complex electrophysiologic profile. The incidence of torsades with sotalol increases with dose and the baseline values of the QT interval; the incidence with d-sotalol and other pure Class III agents remains unclear. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate this are under way. The fact that d-sotalol increases mortality in postinfarction patients suggests that it may possibly be a common property of most, if not all, pure Class III compounds. The ongoing clinical trials with various Class III agents are likely to provide the critical information on this important therapeutic issue.", 
    "41": "The evidence that antiarrhythmic compounds that act by slowing conduction velocity increase mortality in patients with cardiac disease is now compelling. Emphasis is now shifting to agents that act by lengthening repolarization and have additional antiadrenergic properties. There is preliminary evidence that pure Class III agents devoid of antisympathetic activity may also increase rather than decrease mortality in certain patients. Thus, in recent years, sotalol and amiodarone have emerged as the preferred agents for the control of most ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the setting of significant heart disease. Sotalol has not been widely studied in postinfarct patients; one trial indicated that the drug did reduce total mortality but the difference did not reach statistical significance. A number of studies with amiodarone in the postmyocardial infarction patients have revealed benefit, but these were from nonblinded studies. Two blinded, placebo-controlled studies are currently ongoing. A potential new indication of amiodarone is in patients with arrhythmias in heart failure in whom amiodarone markedly increased left ventricular ejection fraction, with a pronounced suppressant effect on premature ventricular complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and a trend for a decrease in mortality in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The most promising indication of amiodarone in low doses is in the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter and fibrillation. For the present, amiodarone appears to be the best prototype of a desirable complex antiarrhythmic compound, if its variegated side effect profile can be favorably modified from knowledge of structure-activity relationships.",

This study used both conventional intracellular and whole-cell patch clamp techniques to record from sympathetic preganglionic neurons in transverse spinal cord slices of the rat (9-21 days old). The metabotropic receptor agonists (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) (10-200 microM, superfused for 2-60 s) and quisqualate (1-50 microM, superfused for 2-60 s) induced concentration-dependent depolarizing responses which did not desensitize. These responses were unaffected by the glutamate ionotropic receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 10-50 microM), 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 10 microM), dizocilpine (MK-801, 10-40 microM), 3-[(R)-2-carboxy-piperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (D-CPP, 10-50 microM) and DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (DL-AP5, 20-100 microM). Depolarizing responses to 1S,3R-ACPD and quisqualate were unaffected by L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (L-AP3, 30 microM-1mM) and L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (L-AP4, 100 microM-1 mM)). The responses to 1S,3R-ACPD and quisqualate were reduced by including the G-protein blocker GDP-beta-S (400 microM) in the patch pipette solution by 77 +/- 2% (mean +/- S.E) of control (n = 3), suggesting that these agonists activate a G-protein-coupled receptor. Metabotropic receptor-mediated responses were maintained in the presence of tetrodotoxin (500 nM), progressively reduced with increased membrane hyperpolarization to around -95 mV and associated with either an increase of 16.5 +/- 2.8% (data from four neurons) in the majority of neurons (n = 22 of 34) or no measurable change (n = 12) in neuronal input resistance. These data suggest that the agonists exert a direct action on 1S,3R-ACPD and quisqualate had several effects on sympathetic preganglionic neuron membrane properties including: inhibition of a slow apamin-insensitive component of the afterhyperpolarization; a reduction in spike frequency adaptation leading to increases in firing frequency from 6.4 +/- 2.8 Hz in control experiments up to 14.7 +/- 3.0 Hz (n = 6 neurons) in the presence of a metabotropic receptor agonist: a broadening of the action potential by 37.5 +/- 6.4% (n = 6 neurons) of control.

Tremor was quantified using the volumetric method, and was decreased significantly after one week on propranolol, 80 mg/day. Theophylline 150 mg/day reduced tremor to the same extent, although the improvement was not significant until the second week. Three patients reported side effects on propranolol.

In 13 dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg), we recorded leads II and aVR as well as the His-bundle electrogram from the aortic root. A deflectable tip multipolar catheter (4 rings, 5 mm apart) was introduced via the right jugular vein into the right ventricle (RV). In 7 dogs, using fluoroscopy, the tip was placed under the tricuspid septal leaflet. In the other 6, after thoracotomy, the same placement was made by palpation through the right atrial wall.

    "52": "Although the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension is mainly explained as a response to an increased pressure load and wall tension, the relation of left ventricular mass with blood pressure is usually weak, even when 24-hour blood pressure monitoring is used. Other factors have therefore been considered, such as anthropometric and demographic characteristics, differences in life-style, genetic influences and neurohumoral factors. Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on neurohumoral factors and it has been suggested that these properties may influence their potency to reduce left ventricular mass, mainly on the basis of open single-drug studies. Several prospective randomized comparative studies have however been performed to assess whether some (classes of) drugs are more effective than others in reducing left ventricular mass. A meta-analysis of such studies, comparing diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and/or converting enzyme inhibitors, suggests that the reduction of left ventricular mass with each of these classes is similar to the reduction obtained with the other 3 classes statistically combined. Of particular interest is the observation that the 4 studies which compared a converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium antagonist concluded that the effect on left ventricular mass was not significantly different. There is evidence, however, that drugs such as minoxidil and hydralazine, do not reduce left ventricular mass.",

Blood pressure was controlled with nicardipine and alpha-blocker during the manipulation of the tumor. After removal of the tumor, dopamine and norepinephrine were used. We used transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to determine the fluid administration rate and doses of catecholamine.

Socio-economic factors, subjective symptoms, and general well-being/quality of life were evaluated by self-administered questionnaires in 99 patients with migraine with or without aura in accordance with the classification of the International Headache Society. Short-term treatment comprising conventional therapy or subcutaneous sumatriptan reduced number of days per month with migraine and absenteeism from work, migraine-associated symptoms, but did not significantly improve general well-being between attacks.

    "56": "Epinine (N-methyl-dopamine, the active metabolite of ibopamine), is a full agonist at dopamine (DA)-receptors and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. To study whether in vivo DA-receptors mediated effects can be separated from alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor effects we compared in 10 male volunteers the effects of i.v. epinine (0.5; 1; 2; 4 micrograms/kg/min for 15 min each) on DA-receptor (changes in serum prolactin)- and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor (changes in systolic [Psyst] and diastolic blood pressure [Pdiast] and heart rate)-mediated effects with those of dopamine before and after propranolol (5 mg i.v. 45 min pre-infusion), bisoprolol (15 mg p.o. 2 h pre-infusion) and domperidone (10 mg p.o. 1 h pre-infusion). At the 0.5 and 1 microgram doses of dopamine and epinine did not effect Psyst, Pdiast and heart rate but significantly decreased prolactin levels. At the higher dose both dopamine and epinine significantly increased Psyst and heart rate, while only epinine significantly increased Pdiast. In addition, both dopamine and epinine significantly increased diuresis and natriuresis; in contrast, only dopamine, but not epinine dose-dependently increased plasma noradrenaline levels. Domperidone did not affect dopamine- and epinine-evoked blood pressure- and heart rate-changes, but antagonized their prolactin-effects (at least at the lower doses). Bisoprolol and propranolol significantly reduced dopamine-induced Psyst- and heart rate-increases to about the same extent. Propranolol enhanced epinine-induced Psyst- and Pdiast-increases while bisoprolol reduced epinine-evoked Psyst-increase but not Pdiast-increase. Epinine-induced heart rate-increase was abolished by bisoprolol and was converted into heart rate-decrease by propranolol. We concluded that in 0.5 and 1 microgram doses (plasma levels of 20-80 nmol/l)epinine acts only at DA-receptors. Thus, ibopamine in therapeutically recommended doses (3 x 100 mg/day with peak plasma epinine-levels of 50-80 nmol/l) very likely activates only DA-receptors. In higher doses, however, epinine-like dopamine-activates alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors whereby epinine has a stronger alpha-adrenoceptor agonistic activity than dopamine.

Decrease in perfusion pressure was measured after induction of tone by continuous infusion with phenylephrine (5-7 microM). Adenosine and ATP caused dose-dependent vasodilation. Following infusion with selective A2 adenosine receptor antagonist, 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX) (10 microM), or non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline (30 microM), vasodilation produced by adenosine were significantly reduced at lower doses. Responses to adenosine were not affected by pretreatment of tissues with either the P2-purinoceptor desensitizing agent, alpha, beta methylene ATP (30 microM), or the P2-purinoceptor antagonist, suramin (10 microM). In contrast, both alpha, beta methylene ATP and suramin significantly attenuate relaxation produced by ATP. Further, it was found that relaxation elicited by either adenosine or ATP was not significantly affected by the presence of glibenclamide (30 microM). Vasodilatation induced by adenosine and ATP was greatly reduced in denuded arteries but more so for ATP than adenosine. It is concluded that adenosine-mediated vasodilatation may hardly be due to the stimulation of A2 adenosine receptors and is strongly dependent on the presence of functional endothelium whereas ATP-mediated vasodilator responses were mediated via the activation of P2-purinoceptors and appeared to be entirely dependent upon the presence of functional endothelium. Further, vasodilator responses to neither adenosine nor ATP were sensitive to inhibition by the potassium channel blocker glibenclamide, in isolated mesenteric perfused bed. This would imply that ATP-sensitive potassium channels were not involved in adenosine and ATP mediated vasodilatation.", 
    "58": "The purpose of this study was to assess hemodynamic responses to lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to -45 torr with selective cardiac parasympathetic (using atropine sulphate), sympathetic efferent (using metoprolol tartrate), and combined (atropine+metoprolol) blockade prior to and following 8 months of endurance exercise training in eight young men. Training resulted in significant increases of maximal oxygen uptake (27%) and blood volume (16%) and a decrease of baseline heart rate (HR, from 66 +/- 4 to 57 +/- 4 bpm). This training related bradycardia was exclusively determined by an enhanced vagal tone as there was no significant difference in intrinsic HR pre- to post-training and only atropine (pre: 100 +/- 3 vs post: 101 +/- 3 bpm), not metoprolol (pre: 56 +/- 3 vs post: 49 +/- 4 bpm), abolished the HR difference. The reflex tachycardia in the control experiment was significantly diminished following training. However, the increase in HR at LBNP -45 torr between pre- and post-training was similar after either atropine (+13 +/- 2 vs +14 +/- 1 bpm) or metoprolol (+8 +/- 1 vs +8 +/- 1 bpm). Reflex tachycardia was greater during atropine than metoprolol blockade and the sum of the HR increase during selective blockade (21 and 22 bpm) was greater when compared with the control (no blockade, 16 +/- 2 vs 11 +/- 2 bpm). There was no difference pre- to post-training in SV or Qc response to -45 torr LBNP during the control condition. However, selective beta 1-receptor blockade resulted in a greater decrease in SV to -45 torr LBNP post-training compared to pre-training (P < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Sensors of posture may improve rate-adaptive pacing in syndromes where syncope occurs in the upright posture, particularly in the young. No sensor of posture has been described to date. Previous studies suggest that two sensors currently under investigation (preejection period [PEP] and left ventricular ejection time [LVET] systolic time intervals [STIs] and accelerometers) may be affected by posture. A PEP-sensing pacemaker is available commercially in which heart rate (HR) decreases with an increase in PEP (delta(HR)/delta[PEP]< 0). In patients with upright syncope, it is not known how such algorithms respond to posture. Also, it is not known whether STIs correlate with posture independent of autonomic tone.", 
    "60": "We studied accelerometer-derived STIs in head-upright tilt-testing with beta-blockade and catecholamine stimulation in patients with syncope or presyncope using an ultra-low-frequency accelerometer placed on the chest. Thirty-two patients age 6 to 22 years with unexplained recurrent syncope or presyncope underwent tilt-testing involving two to four tilts (60 degrees) at baseline, during esmolol infusion (500 micrograms/kg load, 50 to 140 micrograms/kg per minute), after esmolol withdrawal, and during isoproterenol infusion if not contraindicated. PEP, LVET, and other indexes were quantified, and their relations to posture and to autonomic state were determined. With tilt, PEP increased from 98.9 +/- 2.2 to 109.1 +/- 2.8 msec (P < .0001), and LVET decreased (supine-to-upright) from 295.5 +/- 4.5 to 247.2 +/- 4.7 msec (P < .0001). PEP/LVET changed from 0.337 +/- 0.01 to 0.45 +/- 0.02 (P < .0001). Similar postural changes were observed during tilt with beta-blockade and esmolol withdrawal, and during isoproterenol infusion. STI changes occurred immediately on postural change and were stable. Postural change of PEP was greater than the beta-adrenergic effect by 6:1. Postural change of STIs was independent of vagal tone.", 
    "61": "First, accelerometer-derived STIs detect postural changes. Because these changes are independent of autonomic tone and are rapid and stable, they may be useful as fast-response sensors of upright posture in rate-adaptive pacemakers. Second, with postural change, HR increases when PEP increases. However, PEP-sensing pacemakers presently under investigation assume the opposite (inverse) mathematical relationship. Therefore, current PEP-sensing pacemakers use an incorrect algorithm for physiological postural responses in syncope patients. These data predict a paradoxical tachycardic response to the supine posture in patients implanted with these devices.",

The interview identified the time, place, and quality of myocardial infarction pain and other symptoms, the estimated usual frequency of anger during the previous year, and the intensity and timing of anger and other potentially triggering factors during the 26 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. Anger was assessed by the onset anger scale, a single-item, seven-level, self-report scale, and the state anger subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory. Occurrence of anger in the 2 hours preceding the onset of myocardial infarction was compared with its expected frequency using two types of self-matched control data based on the case-crossover study design. The onset anger scale identified 39 patients with episodes of anger in the 2 hours before the onset of myocardial infarction. The relative risk of myocardial infarction in the 2 hours after an episode of anger was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.2). The state anger subscale corroborated these findings with a relative risk of 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.7). Regular users of aspirin had a significantly lower relative risk (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.6) than nonusers (2.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.0 to 4.1) (P < .05).",

Patients responded to sotalol with 80% efficacy and a 22% incidence of adverse side effects. The mean sotalol dose was 116 mg/m2/day, and the average duration of therapy was 15.2 months. In spite of 80% efficacy, only 22% of patients remained on sotalol long-term. Sotalol was discontinued most commonly for either spontaneous resolution of disease or definitive cure by radiofrequency ablation. Other reasons for discontinuation of effective therapy included adverse side effects and arrhythmia control with either an antitachycardia pacemaker or another medication.

The selective norepinephrine[fnc] uptake inhibitors talsupram, tomoxetine, nisoxetine and desipramine substituted for cocaine in the majority of subjects under the low-dose training condition, whereas the selective dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 [1-(2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine] substituted for cocaine under both training conditions and the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram failed to substitute for cocaine under either condition. Representative alpha-1 [St 587 (2-(2-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-phenylimino)imidazolidine] and SDZ NVI 085 [(-)-(4aR, 10aR)-3,4,4a,5,10,10a-hexahydro-6-methoxy-4- methyl-4-methyl-9-(methylthio)-2H-naphth[2,3-b]-1,4-oxazine)], alpha-2 (clonidine and UK 14,304 (5-bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine]) and beta (clenbuterol) adrenoceptor agonists did not consistently substitute for cocaine under either condition in which they were studied. Pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker prazosin antagonized the DS effects of cocaine under both training conditions as well as the cocaine-like effects of talsupram and tomoxetine, but not GBR 12909, under the low-dose training condition. Pretreatment with the alpha-2 blocker efaroxan, the nonselective alpha blocker phentolamine and the beta blocker propranolol failed to alter the DS effects of cocaine consistently under either condition in which they were studied. Pretreatment with talsupram, at doses that did not substitute for cocaine when administered alone, enhanced the cocaine-like effects of GBR 12909 under both training conditions. The results support a role for norepinephrine uptake and alpha-1 adrenoceptor mechanisms in the DS effects of cocaine, possibly reflecting a facilitory noradrenergic influence on mesocorticolimbic dopamine activity.",

Moreover, a similar antinociceptive activity was observed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic or genetically diabetic (db/db) mice. The effects of tiapride (100 mg/kg p.o.) on both phases of the formalin test in normal mice were abolished by pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (800 x 2 mg/kg p.o.), a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) depletor, or pindolol (1 mg/kg i.p.), a 5-HT1 antagonist, but were scarcely affected by 3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate, a 5-HT3 antagonist. Ketanserin (1 mg/kg i.p.), a 5-HT2 antagonist, attenuated the effect of tiapride on the second phase but not on the first phase. This study on the antinociceptive mechanism of action of tiapride (that blocks painful neuropathy in diabetic patients) has led us to hypothesize that the drug attenuates pain transmission through an indirect activation of central 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors.", 
    "90": "Liquid chromatographic techniques that permit the simultaneous analysis of S-adenosylmethionine, melatonin, and its intermediary metabolites N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine within individual pineal glands have been developed. S-Adenosylmethionine has been shown to undergo a marked nyctohemeral rhythm in the pineal gland of the rat, with maximal levels occurring during the light period and minimal levels during the dark period. Detailed studies of the temporal relationships between the levels of S-adenosylmethionine and those of melatonin and its intermediary metabolites suggest that an association exists between the levels of S-adenosylmethionine and the status of the biosynthesis of melatonin. Exposure of animals to continuous light and the administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol were both found to inhibit the induction of melatonin synthesis and prevent the reduction in the levels of S-adenosylmethionine during the dark period. As a corollary the induction of melatonin biosynthesis following the administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol during the light period was accompanied by a marked decrease in the levels of S-adenosylmethionine in the pineal gland. The significance of the link between the nyctohemeral rhythms in the levels of S-adenosylmethionine and the biosynthesis of melatonin in the pineal gland is discussed in the context of the therapeutic efficacy of S-adenosylmethionine as an antidepressant.",

SR 58611A and its acid metabolite SR 58878A, as opposed to BRL 37344, ICI 215,001, and CGP 12177, increased cyclic AMP levels in rat frontal cortex. ICI 215,001, differently from BRL 37344, at concentrations in the millimolar range antagonized norepinephrine- or (-)-isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase partially. The increase of cyclic AMP levels induced by SR 58878A was blocked selectively by beta 1AR antagonist CGP 20712A but not by beta 2AR antagonist ICI 118,551. In addition, PCR analysis did not reveal beta 3AR mRNA, and no specific beta 3AR binding sites were detected by [3H]CGP 12177 in rat frontal cortex. When down-regulation of the beta 1AR ligand binding and mRNA levels had been induced in frontal cortex by chronic administration of imipramine, SR 58878A as well as norepinephrine and (-)-isoproterenol inceased the cyclic AMP production less markedly. Our findings indicate that beta 3ARs are absent in the adult rat frontal cortex, and that various beta 3AR agonists differently affect the frontal cortex beta 1ARs, indicating that SR 58611A may exert its putative antidepressant effect acting on the frontal cortex beta 1ARS.",

A brief application of tolbutamide (10 mumol/l) increased [Ca2+]i in both the beta-cell and the adjacent CPAE cells in co-culture. Suramin (100 mumol/l), an ATP-receptor blocker, inhibited the tolbutamide-induced elevation in [Ca2+]i in the CPAE cells but did not inhibit the elevation in [Ca2+]i in the beta-cell, confirming that the insulin secretagogue-induced Ca2+ response in CPAE cells in co-culture is mediated by ATP released from the beta-cell. When co-culture of the beta-cell and CPAE cells was stimulated by kainate (1 mmol/l) and then tolbutamide (10 mumol/l), the CPAE cells showed elevations in [Ca2+]i in response to kainate and tolbutamide during elevation in [Ca2+]i in the beta-cell. This strongly suggests that insulin secretion as well as an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to different agents, i.e., kainate and tolbutamide, occurs in a single beta-cell. A long exposure of tolbutamide (100 mumol/l, 4 min) resulted in a long-lasting elevation in [Ca2+]i in the beta-cell.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "108": "Complement-mediated pulmonary edema results from increases in lung capillary hydraulic conductivity (Lp), possibly by receptor-mediated mechanisms. We considered the Lp effects of vitronectin and the vitronectin-containing complement complex SC5b-9, which ligate the integrin alpha v beta 3. Vitronectin, SC5b-9, and SC5b-9-enriched zymosan-activated serum all rapidly increased Lp, as determined by the split-drop technique in single lung capillaries of rat lung. The Lp increases were inhibited by a monospecific (LM609) and a polyclonal (R838) antibody against the alpha v beta 3 integrin but not by an irrelevant monoclonal antibody isotype matched with LM609, by a monoclonal antibody against the alpha v beta 5 integrin, or by preimmune rabbit serum. Vitronectin monomers failed to increase Lp. The tyrosine kinase blockers genistein and methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate caused significant concentration-dependent inhibitions of Lp increases due to vitronectin and zymosan-activated serum. By contrast, the protein kinase C blocker calphostin C had no major effect. We conclude that (1) multivalent ligation of the luminally located alpha v beta 3 integrin of lung capillary endothelium increases transcapillary liquid flux, and (2) the dominant signal transduction pathway for this effect occurs through tyrosine kinase activation.", 
    "109": "Torsade de pointes (tdp) is a form of ventricular tachycardia whose occurrence in childhood is very rare. In adults treated with sotalol (Sotalex), tdp has been reported to have an incidence of 2-4%. There have been no reports of its occurrence in children treated with sotalol. We report about a 15-month-old girl with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who developed recurrent syncopal attacks. She had been treated with sotalol at 1.5 mg/kg daily since being a newborn because of recurrent episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Electrocardiogram exhibited frequent tdp tachycardia. Serum electrolyte levels were normal. Echocardiography excluded a structural heart defect and showed no signs of myocardial infection. After sotalol was ceased, infusion with lidocain was started. Despite this therapy the tdp continued. Magnesium aspartate (Magnesiocard) was then administered, and this finally stopped the tdp. As no other cause was evident, tdp in this child must be judged as a proarrhythmia related to sotalol therapy.",

However, mortality remains unchanged. The mechanisms by which beta-blocker therapy improves hemodynamics in chronic heart failure are not known reliably. It is postulated that the negative chronotropic effect of beta-blockers improves the cellular calcium metabolism and thereby increases myocardial contractility. Further effects of beta-blockers are protection of myocardial cells from enhanced catecholamine concentrations. This prevents cell necrosis and economizes the use of cell energy. The reversion of down-regulation of beta-1-receptors in beta-blocker therapy is most probably only an epiphenomenon. Major randomized clinical trials are ongoing to investigate whether improved hemodynamics and clinical course are correlated with decreased mortality. It also still remains open which substance is most beneficial (e.g., selective beta-blockers, beta-blockers with additional vasodilatatory effect).",

The younger brothers first presented at age 16 with an abnormal electrocardiogram. Hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy with an asymmetric septal hypertrophy was diagnosed. He was treated with beta-blocker, but he stopped taking the drug as he had no symptoms at that time. He presented again at age 21 years with symptoms of apparent congestive heart failure. Echocardiography showed marked dilatation of the left ventricle with thin wall which was compatible with dilated cardiomyopathy. The elder brother presented with an initial echocardiogram showing systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve without asymmetric septal hypertrophy. He presented again with his brother aged 21 years when his echocardiogram showed slight dilatation of the left ventricle, although he did not complain of cardiac symptoms.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were hypophysectomized at 50 days of age. One week after operation, hormonal replacement therapy with L-thyroxine and hydrocortisone acetate was given to hypophysectomized rats. Groups of rats were treated with GH (1.33 mg/kg, daily), testosterone (10 mg/kg, once) alone or in combination. After one week of hormonal treatment, adipocytes were isolated from the pooled epididymal and perirenal fat pads and glycerol release after isoproterenol stimulation and 125I-cyanopindolol binding was measured. Hypophysectomy caused a marked decrease in basal and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis. There was no effect of testosterone treatment alone on lipolysis, but GH treatment resulted in an increase in isoproterenol-induced lipolysis but not to the levels observed in cells from control rats. Testosterone and GH in combination restored the lipolytic response to isoproterenol. Also 125I-cyanopindolol binding was decreased after hypophysectomy. Testosterone treatment alone and GH treatment alone increased the binding, while in combination the treatment had an additive effect. Affinity was not changed, but the effects seemed to be on receptor number, as determined by Scatchard analysis. Forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in adipocytes was markedly reduced after hypophysectomy. Testosterone treatment alone had no effect. GH treatment alone increased forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, although the level was lower than that found in control rats. The combined treatment resulted in a further increase to levels observed in adipocytes from control rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This reduction in pulse synchronous nerve activity was not simply a function of bradycardia (heart rate fell from 94.2 (4.6) to 62.8 (5.7) beats/min; P < 0.005) since muscle sympathetic burst incidence also decreased (from 51 (8.7) to 37.5 (5.2) bursts/100 heart beats; P < 0.05).

The BP appears to be influenced by age, sex (higher in males), environment, and diet in some species. We reported previously that mean aortic pressure and heart rate, but not plasma renin activity (PRA), of conscious female domestic fowl were markedly reduced by propranolol. In the present study, we aimed to determine in conscious roosters whether 1) hypotension evoked by atenolol or practolol, which selectively inhibit cardiac beta-receptors in mammals, is more potent than that evoked by propranolol, and 2) the renin-angiotensin (ANG) system and/or catecholamines are involved in beta-adrenoceptor antagonist-induced hypotension. Mean arterial pressure (171.2 +/- 3.5 mmHg) and heart rate (281 +/- 4 beats/min) of chronically cannulated roosters (n = 38) were markedly reduced by acute infusion or repeated injections (14 days) of propranolol, atenolol, or practolol, but not by SQ-14,225 (ANG-converting enzyme inhibitor) or [Sar1, Thr8]ANG II (nonselective ANG receptor antagonist). None of the beta-adrenoceptor blockers, however, showed cardioselectivity. The resting PRA of conscious roosters (1.27 +/- 0.09 ng.ml-1.h-1, n = 38) was low and did not change significantly after chronic or acute treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers except for a slight decrease induced by practolol. PRA increased after SQ-14,225. The plasma levels (pg/ml) of norepinephrine (701.9 +/- 76.0), epinephrine (337.2 +/- 57.1), and dopamine (299.1 +/- 39.0) of conscious roosters were further increased by propranolol.

Approximately 10-min segments of beat-to-beat heartbeat intervals, i.e., HRV, of 10 normal subjects and 11 cardiac disease patients were measured before and after intravenous injection of 0.5-0.75 mg atropine sulfate. HRV data were analyzed by coarse graining spectral analysis (Y. Yamamoto and R. L. Hughson, Physica 68D: 250-264, 1993) to break down their total power into harmonic and nonharmonic (fractal) components. The harmonic component was used to calculate the contribution of high (> 0.15 Hz)-frequency components to total HRV power (%HF). From the fractal component, the contribution of the fractal component to total HRV power (%fractal), the spectral exponent beta, and Hurst scaling exponent (H) were calculated. For both normal subjects and cardiac patients, atropine resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) less mean HRV and significantly (P < 0.05) greater beta compared with control, whereas mean values for %fractal were as high as 70% and were not significantly (P > 0.05) different between atropine and control. The mean value of H with atropine was significantly (P < 0.05) greater than that for control. Directional changes in %HF and beta were consistent with only one exception for a patient who had the smallest change in log %HF by atropine.

    "119": "Biochemical evidence from in vitro studies of brown adipose tissue in Syrian hamsters indicates a significant degree of recruitment of the tissue as an effect of cold acclimation. However, earlier in vivo studies indicate a lack of recruitment of nonshivering thermogenesis in the intact animal as a result of cold acclimation. Because of this apparent discrepancy, the occurrence of cold acclimation-recruited nonshivering thermogenesis in hamsters was investigated. Hamsters were cold acclimated to 6 degrees C or remained at 24 degrees C (controls), and their thermogenic response was investigated in an open-circuit system at 24 degrees C. Cold acclimation resulted in a small increase in resting metabolic rate and a major increase in the thermogenic response to norepinephrine (61% increase over resting metabolic rate in controls and 156% increase in cold-acclimated animals). The absolute beta 3-specific adrenergic agonist CGP-12177 also induced a high rate of nonshivering thermogenesis, which was similarly recruited. It was concluded that, concerning the relative effect of recruitment on the capacity for nonshivering thermogenesis, the intact hamsters responded as would be predicted from in vitro experiments. Thus the hamster does not seem to constitute an exception to the general patterns described for other rodents concerning recruitment of nonshivering thermogenesis due to cold acclimation.", 
    "120": "This study determines, in vivo, whether endogenous adenosine/A1 receptor interactions at juxtaglomerular cells restrain the release of renin induced by receptor-mediated activation of the adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate pathway and whether endogenous adenosine/A2 receptor interactions diminish this restraining response. The following four pharmacological probes were employed: 1) 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) and 2) FK-453, both selective A1 receptor antagonists; 3) FR-113452, a nearly inactive enantiomer of FK-453; and 4) KF-17837, a selective A2 receptor blocker. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared (adrenalectomized, renal denervated, uninephrectomized, and treated with indomethacin, aldosterone, and hydrocortisone) to minimize endogenous stimulation of renin release and received either vehicle (control group) or one of the four drugs. Intrarenal infusions of isoproterenol (3, 30, and 100 ng.kg-1.min-1) caused dose-related increases in plasma renin activity (PRA). This PRA response was significantly augmented in the groups receiving DPCPX (P = 0.0010) or FK-453 (P = 0.0001) but was not altered in the groups treated with FR-113452 (P = 0.3422) or KF-17837 (P = 0.2155). Systemic and renal hemodynamics and renal electrolyte excretions were monitored and could not account for the PRA augmentation caused by the A1 antagonists. This study clearly demonstrates that endogenous adenosine acts on the A1 receptor to restrain the renin release induced by activation of intrarenal beta-adrenoceptors and is not counteracted by endogenous activation of the A2 receptor.", 
    "121": "The influence of 48 hours of starvation on sympathoadrenal regulation of nutrient utilization was investigated in rats. To assess the role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, rats were studied during alpha- and beta-blockade. Energy metabolism was measured using indirect calorimetry before, during, and after moderate swimming exercise (approximately 60% maximal O2 consumption [VO2max]). Additionally, blood samples were taken for determination of nutrient and hormone concentrations. In 48-hour-starved rats, under baseline conditions, there was a reduction in energy expenditure (EE) accompanied by a shift toward fat oxidation (fat-ox) in comparison to fed rats. Exercise-induced responses in EE, fat-ox, and carbohydrate oxidation (CHO-ox) did not differ from those in fed rats. In starved rats, a stronger response to exercise of the sympathoadrenal system was observed. In comparison to control 48-hour-starved rats, blockade of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors led to a reduction in the exercise-induced increase in EE and fat-ox. The rate of CHO-ox was slightly reduced after blockade of either adrenoceptor type. Alpha-blockade prevented the exercise-induced increase in blood glucose. Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) was not affected. Blood lactate, plasma insulin, norepinephrine (NOR), and epinephrine (EPI) were increased after alpha-blockade. Due to beta-blockade, exercise-induced increases in glucose and FFA were prevented. Blood glucose even declined below the baseline value. EPI showed an exaggerated increase, and NOR showed a smaller increase. Results obtained in starved rats support the idea that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade-induced changes in energy metabolism are the result of a diminished oxygen supply due to diminished circulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "122": "The effects of dietary fats consisting of different fatty acids on lipolytic activity and body fat accumulation were studied in rats. Sprague-Dawley male rats were meal-fed an isoenergetic diet based on either beef tallow or safflower oil for 8 weeks. Lipolytic activities in epididymal and subcutaneous adipose tissues were lower in the beef tallow diet group than in the safflower oil diet group. Body fat accumulation was greater in rats fed the beef tallow diet versus the safflower oil diet. Norepinephrine (NE) turnover rates used as an index of sympathetic activities in adipose tissues were lower in the beef tallow diet group. beta-Adrenergic receptor binding was determined with [3H]dihydroalprenolol. Binding affinities of beta-receptors in adipose tissues were significantly lower in the beef tallow diet group. Membrane fluidities of adipose tissues were also lower in the beef tallow diet group. Membrane fluidities were correlated with the affinities of the beta-receptor. We believe from these correlations that the decreases in beta-receptor binding affinities are due to the changes in membrane fluidities. The results of the present study suggest that intake of the beef tallow diet promotes body fat accumulation by reducing lipolytic activities resulting from lower beta-receptor binding and sympathetic activity in adipose tissues.", 
    "123": "Previous reports from this laboratory have shown that pindolol, a partial serotonin1A receptor agonist, inhibited prolactin, but not cortisol secretion induced by administration of the serotonin (5-HT) precursor L-5-hydroxytryptophan or the direct-acting 5-HT2A/5HT2C receptor agonist MK-212. The findings suggest additive or interactive effects of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptors in modulating 5-HT-related prolactin, but not cortisol, responsivity. To examine further the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptors in prolactin and cortisol secretion in healthy men, the effects of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a potent 5-HT receptor agonist, on the above hormones were studied in eight healthy men with and without pindolol pretreatment. It has previously been demonstrated that ketanserin, a 5-HT2A antagonist, and ritanserin, a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist, block the prolactin and attenuate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to mCPP in man or rodents. Administration of mCPP induced a significant increase in plasma concentrations of prolactin and cortisol. The mCPP-induced prolactin concentrations were significantly blocked by pretreatment with pindolol, whereas mCPP-stimulated cortisol levels were not diminished by pindolol pretreatment. Thus, mCPP-induced prolactin secretion appears to require the availability of both 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptor activation, since blockade of either of these receptors may diminish the mCPP-induced prolactin response. Cortisol secretion stimulated by mCPP may occur following 5-HT2C receptor stimulation in the presence of 5-HT1A receptor blockade.",

In all three cell types, pretreatment with NO donors decreased growth factor-induced PIP2 and Ca2+ responses, whereas pretreatment with NO synthase inhibitors increased them. The Ca2(+)-dependent PIP2 hydroysis induced by micromolar concentrations of the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, was also modulated negatively and positively by NO donors and synthase inhibitors, respectively. In contrast, the Ca2+ content of the intracellular stores was unaffected by the various pretreatments employed. NO donors and synthase inhibitors induced an increase and decrease, respectively, of the intracellular cGMP formation in all three cell lines investigated. All of the effects of the NO donors were mimicked by 8-bromo-cGMP administration and abolished by pretreatment with the specific blocker of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, KT5823, which by itself mimicked the effects of the synthase inhibitors. Together with previous observations on G protein-coupled receptors, the present results demonstrate that PIP2 hydrolysis and Ca2+ release occur under the feedback control of NO, independently of the phospholipase C (beta, gamma, or delta type) involved and of the mechanism of activation. Such a control, which appears to be effected by the cGMP-dependent protein kinase I acting at the level of the phospholipases C themselves, might ultimately contribute to the inhibitory role of NO on growth previously observed with various cell types.",

The low yawning response to apomorphine in F344 rats is, therefore, not due to a high baseline dopaminergic or adrenergic activity. Apomorphine-induced yawning in F344 rats was increased after an acute injection of physostigmine, or 24 h after an injection of reserpine.

After a 3-week, open-label, up-titration period, 49 of the 56 patients were assigned (in a double-blind fashion using a 2:1 randomization) to receive either carvedilol (25 mg BID, n = 33) or matching placebo (n = 16) for 14 weeks, while background therapy remained constant. Hemodynamic and functional variables were measured at the start and end of the study. Compared with the placebo group, patients in the carvedilol group showed improved cardiac performance, as reflected by an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (P = .005) and stroke volume index (P = .010) and a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure, mean right atrial pressure, and systemic vascular resistance (P = .003, .002, and .017, respectively). In addition, compared with placebo, patients treated with carvedilol benefited clinically, as shown by an improvement in symptom scores (P = .002), functional class (P = .013), and submaximal exercise tolerance (P = .006). The combined risk of death, worsening heart failure, and life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia was lower in the carvedilol group than in the placebo group (P = .028), but carvedilol-treated patients had more dizziness and advanced heart block.",

Global coronary atherosclerosis and number and severity of distinct stenoses were determined in the patients in 15 proximal coronary arterial segments by use of separate semiquantitative classification systems. The patients had a two- to threefold increase in insulin and insulin propeptide concentrations in the fasting state as well as during the OGTT. Severity of coronary atherosclerosis correlated significantly (P < .05 to P < .01) with basal proinsulin (r = .40) and the proinsulin area under the curve (AUC) (r = .34), basal insulin (r = .31), basal C peptide (r = .30), and the glucose AUC (r = .30). In multiple stepwise regression analysis including insulin-like molecules, major plasma lipoproteins, and lipoprotein subfractions, basal proinsulin (increase in R2 = .09) and dense LDL triglycerides (increase in R2 = .10) predicted 19% of the variation of the global coronary atherosclerosis score after adjustment for age, body mass index, fasting insulin concentration, and VLDL triglycerides.",

    "150": "In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal extracellular accumulations of beta-amyloid (a major component of the senile plaques) and of the excitatory amino acid glutamate are both thought to be associated with degeneration of nerve cells. In the present study, using cultured cortical or hippocampal neurons as an in vitro model, we compared the effects of various factors influencing neurodegeneration mediated by glutamate or by beta-amyloid peptide (A beta). We also asked the question: does long-term treatment with sublethal doses of A beta-(25-35) potentiate glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity? Neuronal cell death was quantified using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) method. Since extracellular LDH remains stable for days, the magnitude of relative afflux of LDH correlates in a linear fashion with the number of damaged neurons in cultures. When applied singly, both glutamate (for 15 min) and A beta-(25-35) or its parent peptide A beta-(1-40) (continuously) produced a dose-dependent neuronal degeneration. In the case of glutamate, the half-maximal effects were observed at about 0.08 mM glutamate for both cerebral cortical and hippocampal neurons (cultured for 13 days in vitro, DIV). The effect of A beta-(25-35) was also time-dependent, while neurons grown in a chemically defined medium showed relatively greater susceptibility to A beta-(25-35) than those cultured in a serum-containing medium. These differential effects were not related to the presence of different numbers of glial cells in the cultures. Treatment with different doses of the antimitotic inhibitor, cytosine arabinoside, for 24 h (6-7 DIV) produced at 13 DIV cortical neuronal cultures with varying numbers of astrocytes, as determined by the astrocyte-specific enzyme glutamine synthetase. The presence of astrocytes decreased the toxicity of glutamate for neurons. The modulation was due to uptake of glutamate by astrocytes, thereby reducing its effective concentration, as the effect was seen at 0.1 mM and not at 10 mM glutamate. Incorporation of an NMDA receptor mediated Ca2+ ion channel blocker, MK-801, together with glutamate completely inhibited degeneration of cortical neurons, and pretreatment of cultures with basic fibroblast growth factor for 2 days did so partially. However, these compounds had no effect on neurotoxicity mediated by A beta-(25-35). Lastly, the effect of glutamate interacted with that of A beta-(25-35). Pretreatment of cortical neurons for 2 days with 10 microM A beta-(25-35) by itself had no appreciable effect, but it potentiated significantly the degeneration of these neurons mediated by glutamate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "157": "Ketanserin has higher affinity for 5-HT1D alpha receptors compared to 5-HT1D beta receptors, whereas, GR127935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2(methyl-4(-(5-methyl- 1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide), a novel and selective 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, has higher affinity for 5-HT1D beta receptors compared to 5-HT1D alpha receptors. In the present study, we compared the effects of ketanserin and GR127935 on sumatriptan-induced responses of rabbit saphenous vein and guinea-pig jugular vein. In rabbit saphenous vein, contractile responses elicited by sumatriptan were antagonised by ketanserin (pA2 = 6.76) and GR127935 (apparent pA2 = 9.4). In guinea-pig jugular vein, concentration-dependent relaxations evoked by sumatriptan were antagonised by ketanserin and GR127935 (apparent pA2 = 5.9 and 10, respectively). Ketanserin but not GR127935, inhibited Ca(2+)-induced contraction of depolarised strips of guinea-pig ileum longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus, however, in rabbit saphenous vein and guinea-pig jugular vein, 5-HT receptor mediated responses were insensitive to nifedipine (Ca2+ channel blocker), eliminating the possibility that the inhibitory effects of ketanserin and GR127935 were due to the blockade of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. Thus, antagonism by ketanserin and GR127935 confirms the presence of 5-HT1D receptors in rabbit saphenous vein and guinea-pig jugular vein. The differential effects of ketanserin and GR127935 on responses elicited by sumatriptan in rabbit saphenous vein and guinea-pig jugular vein may reflect either species differences in 5-HT1D receptors or the involvement of 5-HT1D alpha and 5-HT1D beta receptor subtypes.", 
    "158": "NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (50 mg/kg s.c.), an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, has been reported to increase brain serotonin (5-hhydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) metabolism and induce hypophagia. Conversely, enhanced NO synthase activity is found to be accompanied by a decrease in 5-HT level. This negative correlation between NO and 5-HT in the regulation of food intake was further studied in mice. 5-HT depletion by p-chlorophenylalanine (250 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 2 days) failed to antagonize the hypophagic effect of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Similarly, treatment with the NO synthesis precursor, L-arginine (1000 mg/kg s.c.), did not reverse the anorexia induced by fenfluramine (10 mg/kg s.c.), a 5-HT releaser/uptake inhibitor. Pretreatment with (-)-pindolol, methylsergide and ritanserin had no effect on the hypophagic action of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, suggesting the lack of involvement of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors. The selective neuronal NO synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (12.5-50.0 mg/kg i.p.), however, did not exhibit any hypophagic effect whilst NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased gastric retention, which may subsequently induce satiety.

    "159": "Quantitative descriptions of the mechanical restitution curve as a description of variability in ventricular performance with coupling interval in isolated tissue preparations are widely available. In humans, however, in vivo examination of the force-interval relationship is restricted to test pulse intervals shorter than the sinus cycle length (i.e., incomplete mechanical restitution). The primary objectives in this investigation were therefore to examine this aspect of mechanical restitution in patients with ischemic heart disease and to develop a quantitative description of the phenomenon. Mechanical restitution curves were constructed in 40 patients, most of whom had well-preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function, undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization for the investigation of chest pain, using a single premature test pulse interval during baseline atrial pacing. The mechanical restitution curve, the relationship between LV + dP/dtmax and test pulse interval, was fitted to a rectangular hyperbolic function. From this, the parameter c, the calculated proportional decrease in LV + dP/dtmax at 60% of the resting cycle length, was derived. The mechanical restitution curve-fitting model (involving determination of c) satisfactorily described the force-interval relationship in 37 of the 40 patients studied (as a rectangular hyperbola in 31 and with simple linear regression in 6 patients). The refractory period of the atria/atrioventricular node limited accurate use of the model in the remaining three patients. The parameter c was inversely proportional to both baseline atrial pacing cycle length (P < .001) and LV ejection fraction (P < .02) In patients with normal LV ejection fractions, the derived value of c at a cycle length of 800 ms (c800) was 29.0% baseline LV + dP/dtmax (95% confidence interval, 23.0, 35.0). The presence of hemodynamically significant ischemic heart disease was not a predictor of the parameters of the model. After intravenous injection of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist metoprolol in seven patients, there was a significant (P < .05) reduction in both c and LV + dP/dtmax at the baseline atrial pacing cycle length. Thus, the force-interval relationship can be quantitatively studied using incomplete mechanical restitution curves in humans in vivo. This quantitative description probably reflects relative intracellular calcium availability via slow channel activity and can be used to assess effects of cardioactive drugs on frequency-dependent inotropic mechanisms in humans. The predictive value of this mechanical restitution curve model for hemodynamic instability during tachycardia in patients with impaired LV function remains to be determined.", 
    "160": "Myocardial contractile function was investigated in 84 patients with coronary diseases CD of I-IV functional classes (according to NYHA) and 17 persons with normal coronary arteries using new noninvasive method of construction LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR). Significant decrease of end-systolic elastance, ejection fraction, circumferential fibers shortening velocity and increase of end-systolic and end-diastolic ventricular volume was increased with patient's class number. These data correlated with the increase of total amount of lesion of coronary vessels and extension of asynergic zones. But this contractile function disturbances were not accompanied by significant changes of cardiac output and arterial pressure. When blocking beta-adrenergic receptors with anaprillin it was established that at early stages of CD the compensation of contractile function disturbances is reached via the increasing of heart adrenergic stimulation, and in the patients of III-IV classes the Frank-Starling's law becomes of great significance homo- and heterometric mechanisms efficiency reduces with CD development. These data show that ESPVR reconstruction before and after the blocking of beta-adrenergic receptors allows systolic LV function and efficiency of its regulation to be estimated."
