    "0": "Triiodothyronine (liothyronine sodium) (400-500 mug/day for 14 days) was given to six normal subjects. Factor VIII (antihemophilic globulin) activity increased from 109 to 167% (P < 0.05); fibrinogen increased from 344 to 581 mg/100 ml (P < 0.01). To test whether the increases in factor VIII activity and fibrinogen were mediated by beta adrenergic receptors, propranolol (20 mg every 6 hr) was given orally to four other normal subjects in addition to triiodothyronine for 14 days. Factor VIII increased from 100 to 161%; fibrinogen increased from 374 to 564% (P < 0.01). Factor VIII activity did not change in a severe classical hemophiliac made hypermetabolic with triiodothyronine, but it increased from 39 to 82% in a patient with von Willebrand's disease. Triiodothyronine-induced hypermetabolism increased the incorporation of selenomethionine-(75)Se into plasma fibrinogen. These results suggest that the increases in clotting factor activity during triiodothyronine-induced hypermetabolism reflect an effect of increased protein synthesis rather than enhanced stimulation of beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "1": "1. The antagonistic effect of the beta-receptor blocking compounds propranolol, Ph QA 33 and INPEA on ouabain-induced cardiac fibrillations in guinea-pigs was compared with their local anaesthetic and beta-receptor blocking properties.2. All three compounds were found capable of increasing the tolerance to ouabain and of reversing ouabain-induced fibrillations, the ED50 being 0.3 mg/kg intravenously, 0.5 mg/kg intravenously, and 1.5 mg/kg intravenously, respectively for propranolol, Ph QA 33 and INPEA.3. Propranolol and Ph QA 33 were found to be moderate to strong local anaesthetics while INPEA had a considerably weaker though significant effect.4. The order of potency as beta-receptor blocking compounds was propranolol >/= Ph QA 33 > INPEA, the latter compound being less than 1% as active as propranolol.5. Despite the surprising finding that INPEA was effective against non-catecholamine-induced arrhythmias, the results support the general assumption that the anti-arrhythmic effect of beta-receptor blocking compounds is related to their local anaesthetic action rather than to their beta-blocking ability.", 
    "2": "1. The pressures in the ducts of the parotid and submaxillary glands were recorded in dogs under chloralose-urethane anaesthesia. A single stimulus applied to the parasympathetic nerve regularly caused a pressure rise of short duration. Usually it did not evoke secretion.2. In both glands a single stimulus applied to the vagosympathetic trunk usually caused a pressure response of short duration. It had no secretory effect.3. In the parotid gland, repetitive vagosympathetic stimulation caused a sustained increase of pressure in the duct, usually without inducing secretion.4. In the submaxillary gland, repetitive vagosympathetic stimulation caused a sustained pressure rise, even when the secretory response had been abolished by propranolol.5. It is concluded that the salivary myoepithelial cells of dogs are supplied with fibres from both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system and both can cause the cells to contract."
