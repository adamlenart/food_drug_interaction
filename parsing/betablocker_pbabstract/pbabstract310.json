Three subjective scales were used: (1) the VAS (continuous scale); (2) the Borg scale (12 fixed points); and (3) the Likert scale (LS; 5 fixed points). Four identical submaximal tests were given (2 min at 60% maximum oxygen uptake [VO(2)max] and 6 min at 70% VO(2)max). Two tests were undertaken to assess the reproducibility of scores that were obtained with each subjective scale. Two other tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of each scale to a change in symptom perception: a double-blind treatment with propranolol, 80 mg, (ie, active therapy; to increase the sensation of breathlessness and general fatigue during exercise) or matching placebo. The subjective scale scores were measured at 1 min 30 s, 5 min 30 s, and 7 min 15 s of exercise. Reproducibility was defined as the proportion of total variance (ie, between-subject plus within-subject variance) explained by the between-subject variance given as a percentage. Sensitivity was defined as the effect of the active drug therapy over the variation within subjects.", 
    "5": "Overall, the VAS performed best in terms of reproducibility for breathlessness and general fatigue, with reproducibility coefficients as high as 78%. For sensitivity, the VAS was best for breathlessness (ratio, 2.7) and the Borg scale was most sensitive for general fatigue (ratio, 3.0). The relationships between the respective psychological and physiologic variables were reasonably stable throughout the testing procedure, with overall typical correlations of 0.73 to 0.82",

    "12": "1 The present study examined effects of agonist enzymes and receptor-activating peptides for protease-activated receptors (PARs) on duodenal motility in the rat, and also investigated possible mechanisms underlying the evoked responses. 2 Thrombin at 0.03-0.1 microM and the PAR-1-activating peptide SFLLR-NH2 at 3-100 microM or TFLLR-NH2 at 10-50 microM produced a dual action, relaxation followed by contraction of the duodenal longitudinal muscle. The PAR-2-activating peptide SLIGRL-NH2 at 10-100 microM elicited only small contraction. Trypsin at 0.08 microM induced small contraction, or relaxation followed by contraction, depending on preparations. The PAR-4-activating peptide GYPGKF-NH2 at 1000 microM exhibited no effect. 3 The contractile responses of the duodenal strips to TFLLR-NH2 and to SLIGRL-NH2 were partially attenuated by the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine (1 microM), the protein kinase C inhibitor GF109203X (1 microM) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (15 microM), but were resistant to indomethacin (3 microM) and tetrodotoxin (1-10 microM). 4 The relaxation of the preparations exerted by TFLLR-NH2 was unaffected by indomethacin (3 microM), propranolol (5 microM), NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 microM) and tetrodotoxin (1-10 microM). This relaxation was resistant to either GF109203X (1 microM) or genistein (15 microM), but was, remarkably, attenuated by combined application of these two kinase inhibitors. 5 Apamin (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of calcium-activated, small-conductance potassium channels, but not charybdotoxin (0.1 microM), completely abolished the PAR-1-mediated duodenal relaxation, and significantly enhanced the PAR-1-mediated contraction. 6 These findings demonstrate that PAR-1 plays a dual role, suppression and facilitation of smooth muscle motility in the rat duodenum, while PAR-2 plays a minor excitatory role in the muscle, and that PAR-4 is not involved in the duodenal tension modulation. The results also suggest that the contractile responses to PAR-1 and PAR-2 activation are mediated, in part, by activation of L-type calcium channels, protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase, and that the relaxation response to PAR-1 activation occurs via activation of apamin-sensitive, but charybdotoxin-insensitive, potassium channels, in which both protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase might be involved synergistically.", 
    "13": "This study demonstrates that the tachycardia produced by systemic injections of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (10 microg/kg, i.v.), in conscious rats were not reduced after injection of the selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.), or after subsequent injection of the beta(1,2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.). The hypotensive responses produced by isoproterenol were slightly diminished by atenolol and markedly diminished by propranolol. The tachycardia produced by catecholamines released for cardiac sympathetic nerve terminals were blocked by atenolol. These results suggest that the hypotensive actions of a 10 microg/kg dose of isoproterenol are mediated by activation of beta(1,2)-adrenoceptors whereas the increases in heart rate may be due to activation of another type of beta-adrenoceptor in cardiac pacemaker cells.",

Cationic propranolol-HCl, timolol, sotalol-HCl, atenolol and dexmedetomidine-HCl and neutral diazepam were adsorbed onto a porous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane that was grafted with bioadhesive poly(acrylic acid) chains (PAA-PVDF). Despite its porosity, the PAA-PVDF membrane acted as a cation exchange membrane. The release of adsorbed drug from the PAA-PVDF membrane was investigated by using a USP rotating basket apparatus. Adsorption of cationic drugs onto the PAA-PVDF membrane tended to increase with increasing lipophilicity of the drug. A decrease in the ionic strength of the adsorption medium increased the amount of the cationic drugs adsorbed onto the membrane, but had no effect on diazepam adsorption. The release of cationic drugs from the PAA-PVDF membrane was greatly affected by the ionic strength of both the adsorption medium and the dissolution medium, while ionic strengths did not affect diazepam release. Our results suggest that the ionic strength of both the adsorption and dissolution media substantially affects the release rate of a drug that has been adsorbed onto the ion exchange membrane, primarily via electrostatic interactions, while ionic strength has no effect on the release of a drug which has been adsorbed onto the membrane via non-electrostatic forces.",

Each of four experimental schemes were applied consecutively to each of six dogs. They were pretreated with oral administration of either carvedilol (2 mg/kg b. wt.) or with metoprolol (4 mg/kg b. wt.), or received no premedication. 2 h later the contrast agent BY963 (0.03 ml/kg)--a new transpulmonary contrast agent for sonography, based on phopspholipid stabilized microbubbles--was injected intravenously three times at intervals of 2.5 min 5 min in advance and 7.5, 10, 20, and 30 min following the first injection 60 digitized echocardiography images were recorded during a time period of each 2.9 s. From these images average grey-scale values at predetermined points of time were derived. Time-intensity curves of the region of interest of the interventricular septum were computed. Changes in intensity were calculated by baseline subtraction. Myocardial opacification was observed with all injections of the contrast agent in each dog. The effects were marked and no non-responder was observed. There was no return to baseline grey-scale values within the observation period (30 min). Pretreatment with carvedilol was followed by a more pronounced contrast intensity than was with metoprolol. All administrations were well tolerated. No changes in ECG were observed. Heart rate decrease was marked on metoprolol. Blood pressure dropped to a greater extent on carvedilol compared to metoprolol.",

We evaluated the changes of blood pressure, heart rate and chief complaints of patients before and every 4 weeks during treatment and the renal function before, 12 weeks after and 24 weeks after, the administration of arotinolol hydrochloride. Blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with arotinolol hydrochloride (p < 0.05). However, no significant changes were found in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, serum albumin, beta2-microglobuline, NAG or creatinine clearance during the 24 weeks of treatment. These results indicate that arotinolol hydrochloride has antihypertensive effects without renal dysfunction in elderly patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "24": "The \"Myocardial Infarction Registry\" in Germany (MIR) is a multicenter and prospective registry of consecutively included, unselected patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of MIR is to document the actual praxis of decision making and prescribing of an optimized infarction therapy in AMI patients. Optimized infarction therapy is defined as the combination of reperfusion therapy and ASS, betablocker, and ACE inhibitor.14,598 patients with acute myocardial infarction were included between 12/96 and 5/98 in 217 hospitals throughout Germany. 68% of the patients were male; mean age was 67 years. The prehospital delay time was 195 minutes in median, the first ECG was diagnostic in 66% of the patients. A reperfusion therapy was applied in 46.1% of the patients (thrombolysis 36.2%, primary PTCA 9.9%). During the acute phase, the following adjunctive therapy was used: ASS in 90.3%, betablockers in 53.8%, and ACE inhibitors in 52.5%. Intrahospital mortality was 15.4%. Compared to hospitals without cardiologists, the hospitals with cardiologist had a lower intrahospital mortality (13.8% versus 16.1%; p < 0.001). Reasons are the more frequent use of a reperfusion therapy by cardiologists (54.3% versus 42.3%; p < 0. 001) and the availability of a catheter laboratory with PTCA facilities.A lower intrahospital mortality was associated with each therapy of the optimized infarction therapy: reperfusion therapy (odds ratio 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5-0.8), ASS (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0. 5-0.8), betablocker (odds ratio 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5-0.7) and ACE inhibitor (odds ratio: 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4-0.7). However, patients with poor initial prognosis - such as cardiogenic shock, hypotension and/or bradycardia - could not benefit from the orally adjunctive therapy. This fact may have led to an overestimation of the influence on intrahospital mortality. In representative communal German hospitals, a reperfusion therapy in combination with an optimized adjunctive therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction is associated with a reduction in intrahospital mortality. Compared to previous registries, the application of betablockers and ACE inhibitors was clearly increased. Reasons could be the participation in a quality registry, the obligation to document why a therapy has not been given and repeated and intensified education of the treating physicians.Thus, the mainly communal hospitals in Germany are increasingly following recommendations about the early treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction registries such as MIR reflect daily prescribing habits in hospitals and describe the implementation of the results of randomized trials into daily routine.",

Both beta1- and putative beta4-adrenoceptors mediate arrhythmias but through different mechanisms. To elucidate further the mechanisms of cardiostimulation and arrhythmias we measured Ca2+ transients and L-type Ca2+ currents in mouse ventricular myocytes. We used (-)-CGP 12177, an antagonist of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors with agonist properties at the putative beta4-adrenoceptor, and (-)-isoprenaline as an agonist for beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. (-)-CGP 12177 increased Ca2+ transients in electrically stimulated cells loaded with Indo-1. The maximum increase of Ca2+ transients caused by (-)-CGP 12177 amounted to approximately one-third of that caused by maximally effective (-)-isoprenaline concentrations. Both (-)-CGP 12177 and (-)-isoprenaline caused concentration-dependent arrhythmic Ca2+ transients. The arrhythmias appeared at paced Ca2+ transients and between paced Ca2+ transients. The arrhythmic potency of (-)-CGP 12177 (-logEC50=9.4) was approximately 40 times greater than that of (-)-isoprenaline (-logEC50=7.8). L-type Ca2+ current was measured in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. In the presence of both 3-isobutyl 1-methylxanthine (6 micromol/l) and (-)-propranolol (500 nmol/l), (-)-CGP 12177 (100 nmol/l) increased significantly L-type Ca2+ current by 19% of the effect of (-)-isoprenaline. The (-)-CGP 12177-evoked increase of Ca2+ transients contrasts with the smaller effects on L-type Ca2+ current, suggesting that activation of the putative beta4-adrenoceptor causes a more efficient Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release than activation of the beta1-adrenoceptor. Beta4-Adrenoceptors mediate arrhythmias with smaller Ca2+ transients and smaller increases of L-type Ca2+ current than beta1-adrenoceptors, in line with different but still unknown mechanisms as previously suggested for the intact heart.", 
    "48": "FR 190997, a new kinin B2 receptor agonist of non-peptide nature, has been studied in three isolated vessels: the human umbilical vein (hUV), the rabbit jugular vein (rbJV), and the pig coronary artery (pCA). Bradykinin (BK) contracts the hUV and rbJV through smooth muscle B2 receptors, while it relaxes the pCA through endothelial receptors of the B2 type. Contractions of the hUV and rbJV in response to FR 190997 show slow onset and are not reproducible compared to the rapid and reproducible effect of BK. They reach only 70% and 30% of the BK-induced maximal contractions in the hUV and rbJV, respectively. The effects of FR 190997 are antagonised by HOE 140 and this antagonist shows similar pK(B) values against BK and FR 190997, indicating that the non-peptide agent interacts with the kinin B2 receptor. FR 190997 is inactive as relaxant of the pCA; in this tissue, it acts as a pure and competitive antagonist, with a pK(B) value of 7.6, while HOE 140 acts as an insurmountable antagonist (pK(B) 9.3). When tested as an antagonist, FR 190997 inhibits also the contractile effects of BK in the hUV (pK(B) 7.8) and in the rbJV (pK(B) 7.6). FR 190997 is selective for the B2 receptor since it does not interact with the B1, and is specific since it does not affect the contraction evoked by 5-hydroxytryptamine, endothelin-1, and noradrenaline in the hUV, or the relaxation induced by substance P in the pCA. FR 190997 shows therefore different pharmacological profiles in various preparations, acting as a partial agonist in the hUV and especially in the rbJV and as a pure antagonist in the pCA. This new compound could be of interest in understanding how non-peptide agonists may activate receptors for peptides.",

The selection of the most appropriate LC mode and chiral stationary phase for enantioseparations in bioanalysis is discussed and some aspects of these automated sample preparation procedures are compared, such as selectivity, detectability, elution of the analytes from the extraction sorbent, sample volume and analyte stability.", 
    "50": "The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of metoprolol tartrate 25 mg fatty suppositories were studied in 5 healthy volunteers and in 8 patients suffering from instable angina pectoris. Metoprolol 25 mg capsules were used as a control oral dosage form. Metoprolol showed a considerable rectal bioavailability (AUC, C max) and was absorbed quickly from the rectum (T max). In both groups rectal bioavailability was comparable. However, oral bioavailability was much lower in the volunteer group than in the patient group. Furthermore, ratios of metoprolol/alpha-OH-metoprolol concentrations in plasma and urine gave an indication for a partial avoidance of the first pass effect after rectal administration. Further research is necessary to define an exact rectal dosage of metoprolol. In all patients, a substantial drop in heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure was seen after administration of the first suppository. Metoprolol suppositories appear to be an effective, safe and suitable alternative for patients who are in need for beta blocking medication and who are unable to take oral medication for a certain amount of time.",

The number of people who experienced bumps, stumbles, or orientation problems was almost twice as high in the glaucoma group than the normal-vision group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. The difference between groups also was not significant with respect to the number of people who reported falling in the past year (38% for the glaucoma group and 30% for the normal-vision group) or a fear of falling (28% for the glaucoma group and 23% for the normal-vision group). The visual fields assessed with a Humphrey 24-2 test were more highly correlated with walking speed in glaucoma than the visual fields scored by the Esterman scale or than visual acuity or contrast sensitivity.",

    "55": "1. Following local vasoconstriction-inducing stimuli, such as the cold pressor test (CPT), significant changes occur in haemodynamics, with a rise in arterial blood pressure and heart rate (HR) due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Among the compensatory mechanisms to local ischaemia, the endogenous nucleoside adenosine (ADO) has been suggested to play a relevant role by contributing to sympathetic stimulation. The possibility was investigated that CPT-induced increases in plasma ADO levels were not only an expression of the increased production of ADO in the ischaemic area, but also a consequence of systemic sympathoexcitatory mechanisms, thus showing a bidirectional involvement of the mechanisms of ADO formation. 2. The CPT was performed in 15 volunteers and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and HR were evaluated, together with plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and ADO in the tested and contralateral arm. The 15 subjects were then divided into three groups of five that were treated with either 5 mg transdermal clonidine weekly, 100 mg atenolol daily or 600 mg aminophylline twice daily. After 1 week treatment, the same test was repeated in the respective groups. 3. The CPT induced a rise in MABP and HR and an increase in plasma levels of NA and ADO. Increases in ADO were more pronounced in the tested arm. Clonidine blunted the haemodynamic response and NA release, while increases in ADO increase were reduced to a greater extent in the contralateral arm rather than the tested arm. Atenolol only affected MABP and HR without any effect on NA and ADO levels. Theophylline did not show any effect on CPT-induced changes. 4. In conclusion, local vasoconstriction and ischaemia induced in one arm following CPT are associated with haemodynamic changes dependent on the activation of the sympathetic system. The observed increase in plasma levels of ADO seems to be, in part, a direct expression of local responses to ischaemia (pre-dominant in the tested arm), but also appears as the consequence of systemic sympathoexcitatory mechanisms. Such increases in ADO are not dependent on a beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism. Finally, theophylline, at a therapeutic dose, has no effect on the response to CPT.", 
    "56": "The conformation of the beta-blockers viz. metoprolol, atenolol, bisoprolol, betaxolol and celiprolol has been investigated using Perturbative Configuration Interaction of Localized Orbitals (PCILO) method. The conformational energy maps have been constructed for both the enantiomers (R and S) by rotating the molecule from the para-substituent end. The aryloxypropranolamine moiety adopts the same conformation for all antagonists. The graphical view of R- and S- form of these antagonists in the lowest energy conformation reveals that it is only in the S- form of beta-blockers, all the three functionalities--aromatic moiety, amino and beta-hydroxyl groups are available for interaction with beta-adrenoceptors. The para-substituents of the beta-blockers adopt a conformation which is perpendicular to the aryloxy moiety resulting in an L-shaped structure. The beta-antagonists possibly partition into the lipid bilayer through the para-substituents and the aryloxypropranolamine moiety containing the functionalities, thus, lies parallel to the plane of lipid bilayer for interaction with beta-adrenoceptors. Superimposition of S-bisoprolol in lowest energy conformation with the 3rd putative transmembranous segment of the beta-adrenoceptors reveals that the aromatic moiety, amino and beta-hydroxyl groups of antagonists are involved in interaction with the side chains of Trp-109, Asp-113 and Thr-110 respectively. This has been further substantiated by the interaction studies on the model systems.",

    "61": "Organic acidurias are genetic disorders of mitochondrial metabolism that lead to the accumulation in tissues and biological fluids of organic acids. It has been demonstrated that interaction of carnitine with the cellular CoA pool, through the production of acyl-carnitines, is potentially critical for maintaining normal cellular metabolism under conditions of impaired acyl-CoA use and that exposure of humans and other mammals to ethanol effects leads to impairment of mitochondrial function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of ethanol on urinary excretion of short-chain organic acids and endogenous carnitines in rats. The data reported show that ethanol significantly increases urinary excretion of propionate, methylmalonate, as well as free acetate, butyrate, pyruvate, lactate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Furthermore, the increased formation of propionate and methylmalonate was dependent on the dose of ethanol; did not require the metabolism of ethanol, as was shown in experiments with pyrazole treatment of ethanol rats; and appears to be mediated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms because propranolol almost completely suppresses propionate accumulation. Alcohol administration also increased excretion of specific acyl-carnitines, corresponding to the accumulating acyl groups, whereas excretion of free carnitine was significantly reduced, with respect to control values. The data presented indicate that the short-term ethanol administration is associated with increased excretion of selected organic acids. This study suggests that endogenous carnitine pool might play a role against the deleterious effects of accumulating short-chain organic acids.", 
    "62": "To produce a large mass spectral signal in the analysis of basic drugs by high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS), a high percentage of organic solvent is needed in the mobile phase. With the commonly used reversed phase columns (C18, C8 and C4) high concentrations of organic solvents cannot be used; therefore other stationary phases were investigated. The stationary phases investigated had phenyl ring structures; phenyl (Ph) and pentafluorophenyl (PFP) which were bonded directly to the silica backbone and other phases, pentafluorophenylpropyl (PFPP), phenylpropyl (PhP) and tolylpropyl (TP), which were attached to the silica via a propyl chain. The effects of these stationary phases on retention, peak shape and size of the signal in the mass spectrometric analysis of a selected group of basic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and beta-blockers, were evaluated and compared with those obtained on a C18 column. The PFPP column was found to give the best results. The basic drugs were adequately retained with retention times greater than 2 minutes when the PFPP column was used with mobile phases of high concentrations of organic solvents. Thus the endogenous interferences could be eliminated and the analysis time was still rapid enough to have a high throughput. Most importantly, a mobile phase of 90% acetonitrile could be used which allowed easy desolvation in the ESI interface and provided good peak shapes. In addition, ion-pairing reagents and ion-suppressing agents which suppress the signal in ESI-MS were not required. The best results were obtained using a 1 cm column and a flow rate of 0.9 mL/min. With the PFPP stationary phase and a mobile phase of 90% acetonitrile, the HPLC/ESI mass spectral signal of the beta-blocker, oxprenolol, was increased by a factor of 16 compared with the C18 phase with only 12% acetonitrile in the mobile phase.

    "63": "Immune-mediated beta-cell damage induces diverse intracellular signals, leading to transcription of different genes which may either contribute to beta-cell repair and/or defence or lead to cell death. The cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1) is a potential mediator of beta-cell dysfunction and damage in type 1 diabetes mellitus. To understand the molecular actions of this cytokine upon beta-cells, this study aimed at the cloning of genes induced in FACS-purified rat pancreatic beta-cells by a 6- or 24-h exposure to IL-1 by using differential display of mRNA with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR). Among these cytokine-induced genes, a gene encoding for rat serine protease inhibitor (SPI-3) was isolated. SPI-3 may be involved in cellular defence responses against inflammatory stress. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that SPI-3 mRNA expression in rat beta-cells is increased by IL-1 at an early stage (2 h), with maximal accumulation during 6-12 h and decline after 24 h. Similar observations were made in mouse pancreatic islets and in the rat insulinoma cell line RINm5F. IFN-gamma neither increased SPI-3 gene expression nor potentiated its induction by IL-1 in rat beta-cells. The stimulatory effects of IL-1 on SPI-3 mRNA expression were decreased by co-incubation with an inhibitor of gene transcription (actinomycin D), an inhibitor of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) or an inhibitor of NF-kappaB activation (PDTC). On the other hand, a blocker of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity (N(G)-methyl-L-arginine) did not prevent IL-1-induced SPI-3 expression. Thus, SPI-3 mRNA expression following IL-1 exposure depends on gene transcription, protein synthesis and activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB, but it is independent of NO formation.", 
    "64": "We have previously demonstrated that turkey poults fed furazolidone (Fz) in high concentrations (700 ppm) develop dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) which approximates the human condition [1-3]. We wanted to study the effects of a calcium channel blocker in an animal model with a documented decrease in beta-receptor density, increased levels of circulating catecholamines, and abnormal calcium metabolism. The effects of a third generation calcium channel blocker has not been studied in our model. We hypothesized that the model would be predictive of the human condition and provide additional insights into the potential use of Ca2+ channel blockers in the setting of DCM. In the present study, we examined the effect of pranidipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in the setting of DCM on the gross and microscopic morphology of the heart and the overall contractile performance of the myocardium. A state of symptomatic to mild cardiomyopathy was induced in Broad-Breasted White turkey poults by administration of Fz for three weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, fractional shortening, and body weight were monitored and compared in DCM animals treated with pranidipine and those given a placebo. After four weeks of treatment or no treatment with pranidipine, animals were euthanized and heart weight, cardiac dimensions, and microscopic morphology were compared. Progressive left ventricular (LV) dilatation and wall thinning was prevented with pranidipine treatment. In addition, microscopic examination demonstrated myocyte hypertrophy regression in DCM animals treated with pranidipine. In DCM animals, treatment with pranidipine resulted in significantly smaller left ventricular dimensions. We conclude that the calcium channel blocker pranidipine was not detrimental to global cardiac function in animals with dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Beta blockers have few clinically important effects on hypoglycemic awareness and recovery, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, or lipid profiles. Moreover, when diabetics have been treated with beta blockers for hypertension or for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, they benefit as much, if not more, than nondiabetic patients. There may be circumstances (e.g., hypertensive patients with coronary disease) under which beta blockers are the drugs of first choice for diabetic patients. Recommendations to use agents other than beta blockers for the treatment of hypertension in diabetes are based on these agents' effectiveness against surrogate endpoints, and not their proven benefit in preventing important clinical endpoints.",

However, when the tissues were contracted with methoxamine, (+/-)-dobutamine evoked concentration-dependent relaxation. The relaxant responses were not significantly affected by propranolol. In the same preparation, propranolol competitively antagonized isoprenaline-induced relaxation with a -log K(B) value of 7.90+/-0.26. (+/-)-Dobutamine did not relax arterial ring segments precontracted with vasopressin (10(-7) M). (+/-)-Dobutamine antagonized noradrenaline-induced contractions of the gastric artery segments. The pA2 value was 6.93+/-0.20, and the slope of the Schild regression line was 1.22+/-0.14. This value (slope) was not significantly different from 1, indicating competitive antagonism. Pretreatment of gastric artery segments with dobutamine before phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) protected against inactivation of alpha1-adrenoceptors by PBZ. The dose ratio of prazosin (3x10(-9) M) and (+/-)-dobutamine (10(-5) M) in combination was close to the expected sum of their individual dose ratios minus 1, indicating interaction with a common site.

    "74": "Pregnancy is known to increase myocardial susceptibility to bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular collapse, and prolonged pretreatment of rabbits with high doses of progesterone potentiates bupivacaine's depression of the maximal rate of increase (Vmax) of the cardiac action potential. Short-term effects of progesterone are not detected in vitro, but other steroids elevated during pregnancy might be acutely active in this model. These experiments tested whether acute exposure to beta-estradiol potentiates local anesthetic/antiarrhythmic depression of Vmax and conduction velocity in rabbit cardiac tissue in vitro. Standard intracellular microelectrodes were used to measure electrophysiologic changes produced by beta-estradiol, local anesthetics, or both in dissected segments of heart containing the Purkinje fiber and ventricular muscle cells from ovariectomized rabbits. In tissues preincubated in beta-estradiol (3.3 nM), addition of bupivacaine (10.4 microM), or lidocaine (85.4 and 129 microM) decreased Vmax significantly more than in steroid-free Tyrode's (p<0.001). Alone, beta-estradiol had no effect on Vmax and depression of Vmax by the nonanesthetic Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX, 3 microM) was not potentiated by beta-estradiol. In preparations initially exposed to bupivacaine for 30 min, subsequent addition of beta-estradiol decreased Vmax further within 10 min (p<0.05). Bupivacaine's greater depression of Vmax at higher frequencies (3 Hz) was exaggerated by beta-estradiol. However, the rate-dependent slowing of conduction by bupivacaine was lessened or even reversed by beta-estradiol addition. Such rapid physiologic changes cannot be due to genomic actions by the hormone that take hours to manifest. Nor is the potentiation due to a general decrease in membrane excitability because the comparable inhibition by TTX is insensitive to estradiol. Because beta-estradiol potentiates the inhibition of myocardial excitability, but alleviates the slowing of impulse conduction between the Purkinje fiber and ventricular muscle produced by local anesthetics, the hormone must produce changes in more than one ionic conductance. Both pregnancy and conditions that abnormally alter levels of steroid hormones have ramifications for local anesthetic-induced cardiotoxicity and antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapeutics.", 
    "75": "The prospective evaluation and follow-up of 39 consecutive subjects with VT/VF, 6 of whom, with cardiac arrest (CA), are reported. Patients were enrolled in a specific staged-care approach protocol, which included coronary arteriography (CAR) and ventriculography (VC), in order to exclude the need of cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), with and without left ventricular aneurysmectomy (LVA). The protocol included inducibility of VT/VF, which was verified by programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in control conditions and after antiarrhythmic therapy (ADT), to assess persistent inducibility and mainly to verify the hemodynamic sequelae of VT. VT that showed poor hemodynamic tolerance was treated with ICD, while well-tolerated VT was treated by ADT or ablation when indicated. Furthermore, PES was obtained after surgical procedures. As a first step, the patients were assigned to receive amiodarone (AMIO) (200-400 mg/daily) in the presence of EF% < 30% or contraindication to sotalol, (Group A), or sotalol (SOT) (80-140 mg/daily) in the presence of EF > or = 31%. (Group C). Conversely, in case of recurrences, patients were assigned to receive AMIO (200-300 mg/daily) plus metoprolol (MET) (20-100 mg/daily), (Group B) or, in case of intolerance to beta-blockers, to AMIO plus mexiletine (MEX) (200 mg/daily) (Group D). The four groups were similar for the type of VA, with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (RVT) being the most frequent one. The most frequent underlying cardiac disease of VA in this study was post-AMI CAD, with a rate of over 60% in all four groups. Single- and two-vessel lesions were found at CAR in various patients in all four groups, in 5/13 (38%) in Group A, in 8/14 (57%) in Group B, in 5/7 (71%) in Group C, and in 3/5 (60%) in Group D. Cardiac surgery was performed in a similar and limited number of patients in all four groups, in 4/13 (30%) in Group A, in 4/14 (35%) in Group B, in 2/7 (28%) in Group C, and in 2/5 (40%) in Group D. In 8/39 (20.5%) of the patients who underwent CABG, there was no operative or late mortality; 4/39 (10.2%) received CABG and LVA, and two died. For the amiodarone plus metoprolol and sotalol patients only, PES showed a lower residual inducibility, in comparison to the amiodarone and amiodarone + mexiletine groups. In the entire group, 7 out of 26 (27%) were still inducibile at PES while in 19/26 (64%) of the patients, an apparently effective treatment could be found, documenting the relative usefulness of PES. Recurrence rate was the highest in the amiodarone + mexiletine group and in patients with previous CA. Our data show the potential utility and limitations of ADT, even using the most effective antiarrhythmic drugs and association of drugs, mainly because of the high recurrence rate of VT observed in the present study, even in non-inducible patients [14/39 (36%)]. In conclusion, in a prospective and staged-care approach protocol of management of VT/VF patients, only a few patients with VT/VF benefited from cardiac surgery. PES could still play a role in the evaluation of the most effective ADT. Amiodarone + metoprolol seems to be the most effective ADT in these patients. Nevertheless, a high recurrence rate was observed in this patient population, even with an aggressive protocol, in the short follow-up period of 12 +/- 8 months, confirming recent data on the superiority of ICD to ADT, in patients with frequent recurrences or hemodynamically poorly-tolerated VT. In these patients, ICD therapy should definitively be preferred to ADT.", 
    "76": "(+)-MK801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, was reported to exhibit anticonvulsive and neuroprotective activities during the postischemic period. Intravenous administration of (+)-MK801 produced tachycardia in rats, but bradycardia in pigs. We examined the mechanical and electrophysiological effects of (+)-MK801 on rat cardiac tissues. (+)-MK801 dose-dependently increased (3-100 microM) twitch tension in rat atria and ventricular strips. The spontaneous beating rate in rat right atria, however, was dose-dependently decreased by (+)-MK801. The inotropic effect of (+)-MK801 was affected neither by alpha(1)-antagonist (1 microM prazosin) nor by beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist (3 microM atenolol), but significantly by a transient outward K(+) channel blocker (3 mM 4-aminopyridine). (+)-MK801 did not cause any significant change of intracellular cAMP content. Electrophysiological study in rat ventricular cells revealed that (+)-MK801 concentration-dependently prolonged the action potential duration with a concomitant decrease in the maximum rate of the action potential upstroke (V(max)) and an increase in the recovery time constant of V(max). Voltage clamp study showed that (+)-MK801 (3 microM) reduced inward Na(+) current (I(Na)), along with a slowing of its recovery from inactivation and a slight negative shift of its voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation curves. At a much higher concentration (30 microM), (+)-MK801 slightly reduced the amplitude of L-type calcium inward current (I(Ca)), although the voltage dependence of its steady-state inactivation was unaffected. For the potassium currents in rat ventricular cells, 3 microM of (+)-MK801 reduced the peak transient outward current (I(to)), steady-state outward current (I(ss)) and inward current through K(1) channels. The inhibition of I(to) was associated with a prominent negative shift in the voltage dependence of its steady-state inactivation curve. The outward current through K(1) channels was unaffected. These results indicate that (+)-MK801 may be a strong I(Na) and I(to) blocker with some I(Ca) blocking activity. The inhibition of I(to) and other K(+) efflux would prolong action potential duration, produce positive inotropic action and contribute to the negative chronotropic effect of (+)-MK801.",

    "78": "Seventy-nine patients with frequent episodes of paroxysmal AF and 10 control patients were included. Distal PVs showed the shortest effective refractory periods (ERPs), and right superior PVs showed a higher incidence of intra-PV conduction block than left superior PVs. Superior and left PVs had longer myocardial sleeves than inferior and right PVs, respectively. These electrophysiological characteristics were similar between AF and control patients. Propranolol, verapamil, and procainamide suppressed ectopic beats that originated from the PVs. Of 116 ectopic foci that initiated AF, 103 (88.8%) originated from PVs. A mean of 7+/-3 RF applications completely eliminated 110 ectopic foci (94.8%). During the 6+/-2-month follow-up period, 68 patients (86. 1%) were free of AF without any antiarrhythmic drugs. Follow-up transesophageal echocardiogram showed 42.4% of ablated PVs had focal stenosis.

    "80": "Evidence from animal studies suggests that beta-blockers can act within the central nervous system to increase cardiac vagal motoneuron activity. We have attempted to determine whether such an effect is evident in healthy humans, by examining the effects of lipophilic and hydrophilic agents on heart rate variability and cardiac vagal reflexes. A total of 20 healthy volunteers took part in the study. Autonomic studies were performed after 72 h of treatment with placebo, atenolol or metoprolol in a blinded cross-over design. ECG recordings were taken at rest and during mental and orthostatic stress. Heart rate variability was measured in the time and frequency domains. The effects on heart rate of two opposing cardiac vagal reflexes were examined. Trigeminal stimulation causing vagal stimulation, and isometric forearm muscle contraction ('muscle heart reflex') causing vagal inhibition, were performed alone and simultaneously. At rest, during mental stress and during trigeminal stimulation, beta-blocker therapy was associated with significantly increased high-frequency beat-to-beat heart rate variability when compared with placebo. There were no significant differences in effects on heart rate or heart rate variability between atenolol and metoprolol. Analysis of the muscle heart reflex, alone and with simultaneous trigeminal stimulation, showed that the magnitude of the R-R interval response was significantly greater after beta-blocker therapy compared with placebo, but the effects of atenolol and metoprolol were equivalent. beta-Blocker therapy increased cardiac vagal activity, as shown by measures of high-frequency heart rate variability and reflex studies. Lipophilic and hydrophilic beta-blockers appeared to be equally efficacious in increasing the cardiac vagal modulation of heart rate.", 
    "81": "The ATP dependent Ca2+ uptake of platelet vesicles was inhibited by the two hydrophobic drugs trifluoperazine (TFP) and propranolol (PROP). Inhibition was significantly lowered when Pi was used instead of oxalate as a precipitant agent. When the ATPase ligands substrate (Mg2+ and Pi) were absent of the efflux medium, a slow release of Ca2+ which did not couple with ATP synthesis (passive Ca2+ efflux) was observed. Both, TFP and PROP enhanced the passive Ca2+ efflux. This enhanced efflux was partially inhibited only when Mg2+ and Pi were added together to the efflux reaction media, but it was not affected by spermidine, ruthenium red or thapsigargin (TG). The Ca2+ ionophores A23187 and ionomycin, also enhanced passive Ca2+ efflux. However, in this case, Ca2+ efflux was inhibited just by inclusion of Mg2+ to the medium. Ca2+ efflux promoted by Triton X-100 was not affected by either Mg2+ or Pi, included together or separately into the efflux medium. The ATP <==> Pi measured in the presence of Triton X-100 and millimolar Ca2+ concentrations was inhibited by both TFP and PROP, but not by Ca2+ ionophores up to 4 microM. The data suggest that the observed enhancement of passive Ca2+ efflux promoted by TFP and PROP could be attributed to a direct effect of these drugs over the platelet Ca2+ pump isoforms (Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase, SERCA2b and SERCA3) themselves, as it was reported for the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1).", 
    "82": "The effect of temperature on the resolution of (RS)-sotalol by immobilized cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I) was studied between 5 and 40 degrees C and Van 't Hoff plots of ln k versus 1/T were acquired at different pH values of the aqueous mobile phase and in the presence of varying organic cosolvents. The elution order of the enantiomers reverses in the range between 17 and 28 degrees C. Beyond this range, enantioseparations with comparatively high resolution factors are achieved either by decreasing or by increasing the temperature. The composition of the mobile phase influences the \"crossover\" temperature as well as the character of the global adsorption process of the (R)-(-)-enantiomer. Under certain conditions, (R)-(-)-sotalol exhibits an unusual endothermic adsorption behavior. Its retention time increases with increasing temperature. At room temperature (23 degrees C) the enantiomeric elution order can also be regulated by the solvent additive.",

Three weeks after starting ticlopidine the patient complained of itching, and on day 28 painless jaundice developed. At this time, the serum activities of alkaline phosphatase (923 U/l), gamma-GT (823 U/l) and total bilirubin concentration (129 mumol/l) were markedly elevated, whereas the activities of the transaminases (AST 131 U/l, ALT 194 U/l) were slightly increased. An extra- or intrahepatic biliary obstruction was ruled out, and there were no signs of a toxic, infectious or immunological cause for the hepatic injury. Liver biopsy showed centro-acinar cholestasis. After drug discontinuation the itching stopped after 4 weeks and jaundice disappeared after 2 weeks.

In all cases the jaundice resolved and serum liver enzyme concentrations normalised over a period of months. Characteristically, liver biopsies demonstrated centro-acinar cholestasis.

There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy.",

By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25).

Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes. A lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96).",

However, latanoprost and brimonidine are often given as monotherapy as well as early adjunctive therapy. In addition, newer treatments that are used as early adjunctive therapy are dorzolamide, brinzolamide, apraclonidine, and the combination products, consisting of dorzolamide/timolol maleate and pilocarpine/timolol maleate. Older adjunctive treatments are now often prescribed as late adjunctive therapy including pilocarpine, epinephrine compounds, and acetazolamide. The extent of maximum tolerated medical therapy and the decision to perform either laser or conventional filtration surgery depend on the physician's judgment and on the patient's needs and preferences. In the future, newer medical therapies that may protect the health of the optic nerve directly could be developed including blood flow-based, neuroprotective, and genetically based agents.",

Medical therapy, laser trabeculoplasty, and filtration surgery each have their advocates as the best modality for initial treatment. The advantages and disadvantages of these three options are discussed here. It is pointed out that there may not be a single answer as to how to begin treatment. Patient factors such as age, general health, and stage of glaucoma as well as various socioeconomic and technologic factors may lead to different recommendations for different patients. At present, most patients with open-angle glaucoma are started on medical therapy. beta-Blockers are used most commonly as the initial drug of choice, but latanoprost and brimonidine are now being recommended by many as alternate first-line therapy.", 
    "96": "We reviewed the literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy and examined the economic consequences of under-utilisation. Despite the literature documenting the value of beta-blockers, the therapy is not prescribed at the appropriate rates. Approximately half of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) survivors who are eligible for the therapy do not receive it. There are 3 sources of costs that may arise from such under-utilisation: (i) increased morbidity and mortality associated with under-use; (ii) increased demand for related medical resources when the health state following an AMI is suboptimal due to under-use of beta-blocker therapy; and (iii) increased cost due to substitution of higher cost and/or less effective treatments for beta-blockers. For the first category, there is evidence suggesting that around 2900 to 5000 lives are lost in the US in the first year following an AMI due to underprescription. There is very little evidence on the second category of costs; 1 recent study does address this issue and indicates that beta-blocker therapy can lead to a 22% relative risk reduction for hospital readmission during the first year. Several studies also show a decrease in reinfarction. There is no information that addresses the third category of costs adequately (though 1 study does present evidence of substitution of calcium channel-blockers for beta-blockers). We conclude that there is a dearth of evidence on the economic consequences of the under-utilisation of beta-blocker therapy. What does exist suggests that the net costs to society may be substantial.", 
    "97": "The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate a physiological response to TA2005, a potent m-adrenoceptor (beta2-AR) selective agonist, in right atria isolated from stressed female rats under the influence of the estrous cycle. We obtained concentration-response curves to the agonist in the presence and in the absence of selective antagonists in right atria isolated from female rats submitted to three daily foot-shock sessions (30 min duration, 120 pulses of 1.0 mA, 1.0 s, applied at random intervals of 5-25 s) and sacrificed at estrus or diestrus. Our results showed that the pD2 values of TA2005 were not influenced by estrous cycle phase or foot-shock stress. However, in right atria from stressed rats sacrificed during diestrus, the concentration-response curve to TA2005 was biphasic, with a response being obtained at concentrations of 0.1 nM, whereas during estrus no response was observed at doses lower than 3 nM. ICI 1118,551, a beta2-AR antagonist, abolished the response to nanomolar concentrations of TA2005 in right atria from stressed rats at diestrus, with no changes in agonist pD2 values in right atria from control rats (7.47 +/- 0.09, p > 0.05) but a 3-fold decrease in pD2 values of TA2005 in right atria from foot shock stressed rats (7.90 +/- 0.07, p < or = 0.05). Concentration-response curves to TA2005 in the presence of ICI118,551 were best fitted by a one-site model equation. The beta1-AR antagonist, CGP20712A, shifted to the right only the second part of the concentration-response curves to the agonist, unmasking the putative beta2-AR-mediated response to the agonist in tissues isolated from stressed rats at diestrus. Under this condition, concentration-response curves to the agonist were best fitted by a two-site model equation. pD2 and maximum response of TA2005 interaction with beta1- and putative beta2-adrenoceptor components were calculated. Schild analyses gave a pK(B) value for CGP20712A that was typical for the interaction with beta1-AR in each experimental group. pK(B) values for ICI118,551 could not be obtained in stressed rats sacrificed at diestrus since Schild plot slopes were lower than 1.0. In right atria from control rats, ICI118,551 pK(B) values were similar to reported values for the interaction of the antagonist with beta1-AR. These results confirm that a heterogenous beta-AR population mediating the chronotropic response to catecholamines can be demonstrated in right atria from foot shock stressed female rats sacrificed at diestrus. The stress-induced response seems to be mediated by the beta2-AR subtype. Right atria from rats sacrificed during estrus are protected against stress-induced alterations on the homogeneity of beta-AR population.", 
    "98": "Eight representative beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, acebutolol, atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol, nadolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol, were studied in vitro with respect to their potential to block energy-dependent uptake of [3H]amantadine into proximal and distal rat renal tubule fragments in the presence and absence of bicarbonate. Five of the eight beta-adrenoreceptor blockers showed a dose-dependent inhibition of renal tubule accumulation of amantadine: labetalol, metoprolol, pindolol, propranolol, and timolol. Labetalol was the only beta-adrenoreceptor blocker with greater inhibitory potency in phosphate-based buffer than in bicarbonate-based buffer. Propranolol was the most potent inhibitor of renal tubule amantadine accumulation with IC50 values of 15 +/- 10 and 31 +/- 11 microM for proximal and distal tubule fragments, respectively, in a bicarbonate-based buffer environment. Inhibition in a phosphate-based buffer was less potent only in proximal tubules, with an IC50 of 76 +/- 30 microM. Kinetic studies of propranolol inhibition of amantadine uptake were consistent with both uncompetitive and competitive inhibition mechanisms in bicarbonate-based buffer in both proximal and distal renal tubule segments. There was no chiral preference between the R and S forms of propranolol for the inhibitory effects observed. These data suggest that there is potential for selection among the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs to minimize or restrict the inhibition of amantadine energy-dependent uptake at the organic cation ion uptake sites characterized by amantadine in the presence and absence of bicarbonate.", 
    "99": "Organotypic rat hippocampal slice cultures were used to study the role of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in kainate-induced cell death. Expression of the neuronal (EAAT3) or glial (EAAT2) transporters was inhibited with antisense phosphothioate oligonucleotides, and cytotoxicity was assessed with propidium iodide uptake. In control cultures, a concentration of 10 microM kainate was more cytotoxic in CA3 than in CA1. Treatment for 24 h with EAAT3 antisense oligonucleotide decreased kainate toxicity in CA1 but had an opposite effect in CA3. Neither antisense oligonucleotide to EAAT2 nor mismatch oligonucleotide to EAAT3 decreased kainate toxicity in CA1. Immunoblotting with affinity-purified antibodies showed that EAAT3 antisense oligonucleotide decreased selectively EAAT3 but not EAAT2 protein levels, and vice versa. NMDA was more cytotoxic in CA1 than in CA3, and antisense oligonucleotides to either EAAT3 or EAAT2 did not decrease the NMDA effect in CA1 or CA3. Dihydrokainate and DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid were more cytotoxic in CA1 than in CA3, suggesting that the higher vulnerability of CA3 to kainate was not the result of its activity as transporter blocker. We conclude that glutamate transporters differentially regulate excitotoxicity in different hippocampal subfields.",

Similar increases in plasma NE (though not E) were seen in SHR without adrenal medullae. Blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol (pro; 3 mg/kg, 8 SHR) enhanced the rapid depressor response to i.v. metformin before GB (delta MAP, mmHg: -38 +/- 4 with pro vs -17 +/- 3 without pro; p < 0.05) and attenuated the rapid pressor response to i.v. metformin after GB (delta MAP, mmHg: +8 +/- 3 with pro vs +30 +/- 4 without pro; p < 0.05). Results were similar in SHR without adrenal medullae. Finally, if baseline MAP under GB was raised back to hypertensive levels with i.v. infusion of either NE or phenylephrine then i.v. metformin did not raise but rather reduced MAP in SHR.", 
    "103": "The acute depressor action of i.v. metformin in female SHR (1) is most likely due to a direct vasodilator action which includes inhibition of alpha-receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and (2) is buffered by an acute beta-receptor-mediated pressor action likely due to a direct metformin-induced release of NE from postganglionic sympathetic nerve endings.", 
    "104": "Day-activity rhythms of heart rate and blood pressure are thought to be mediated mainly through the sympathetic nervous system and may have greater amplitudes in patients with hypertension owing to increased daytime and largely normal nighttime values. Drug-induced nighttime hypotension in patients with chronic hypertension has been associated with the precipitation of cardiac failure and a fall in cerebral flow. The authors examined the effects of a single dose and of a 4-week treatment with different classes of antihypertensive drugs on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in 10 patients with mild hypertension. Data were assessed by polynomial analysis (Harvard Graphics 3). A single oral dose of enalapril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, carvedilol 25 mg, and celiprolol 200 mg produced a mean reduction of 24-hour ABP compared to placebo of, respectively, 24/11, 11/5, 13/6, and 12/5 mm Hg (p values between <0.02 and <0.001). With enalapril, amlodipine, and carvedilol, between-subject variability contributed significantly to the overall variability in the measurements (p values between 0.05 and 0.01 versus zero), whereas with celiprolol this was not so. Although the beta blockers reduced daytime blood pressures similarly to the ACE inhibitor or the calcium channel blocker, they did not reduce nighttime blood pressures. These results were confirmed by an 8-week crossover trial comparing enalapril 10 mg daily with celiprolol 200 mg daily in the same group of patients. The authors conclude (1) that beta blockers produce a more stable reduction of blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension less affected by pressor effects through the sympathetic nervous system; (2) that beta blockers, unlike ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, do not give rise to nighttime hypotension in this category of patients; and (3) that the selective beta blocker celiprolol may even perform better in these respects than the nonselective beta blocker carvedilol.", 
    "105": "In a previous clinical study we have demonstrated a significantly lower baroreflex-mediated bradycardic response in young women compared with men. The present study determined whether sexual dimorphism in baroreflex sensitivity in young rats also covers the reflex tachycardic response. The study was then extended to test the hypothesis that an attenuated cardiac cholinergic component of the baroreflex heart rate response in females may account for the gender difference. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was expressed as the regression coefficient of the reciprocal relationship between evoked changes in blood pressure and heart rate. BRS measured in conscious rats with phenylephrine (BRS(PE)) and nitroprusside (BRS(NP)) represented the reflex bradycardic and tachycardic responses, respectively. Female rats exhibited significantly lower BRS(PE) compared with male rats (-1.53+/-0.1 vs. -2.36+/-0.13 beats x min(-1) x mmHg(-1); p < 0.05) but similar BRS(NP) (-2.60+/-0.20 vs. -2.29+/-0.17 beats x min(-1) x mmHg(-1)). Blockade of cardiac muscarinic receptors with atropine methyl bromide elicited greater attenuation of BRS(PE) in male than in female rats (72+/-4.6 vs. 53+/-6.7% inhibition; p < 0.01) and abolished the gender difference. In male rats cardiac muscarinic blockade attenuated BRS(PE) significantly more than did cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor blockade with propranolol (72+/-4.6 vs. 43+/-2.7; p < 0.01), which suggests greater dependence of BRS(PE) on the parasympathetic component. In females, muscarinic and beta-adrenergic blockade elicited similar attenuation of BRS(PE). The findings suggest that (i) BRS is differentially influenced by gender; female rats exhibit substantially lower BRS(PE) but similar BRS(NP) compared with age-matched male rats and (ii) the sexual dimorphism in BRS(PE) results, at least partly, from a smaller increase in vagal outflow to the heart in response to baroreceptor activation.", 
    "106": "Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of cardiovascular surgery. The 2 most important risk factors for its development are advancing age and a preoperative history of atrial fibrillation. Long-term sequelae, such as a stroke, are uncommon; however, atrial fibrillation frequently results in an increased length and cost of hospitalization. Strategies to prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation include perioperative beta-blockers, amiodarone, and atrial pacing. These strategies are most effective in high-risk patients. When atrial fibrillation does occur, treatment includes control of the ventricular rate, systemic anticoagulation, and conversion back to sinus rhythm.",

The good results were still present 12 months postoperatively.", 
    "110": "The described, rarely seen form of LVOT was probably caused by a combination of a very large anterior mitral leaflet, postoperative pericardial effusion and pharmacological effects.

    "111": "Pregnancy is associated with an antinociception that is multifactorial and results from spinal (kappa/delta) opioid antinociceptive pathways as well as peripheral processes (ovarian sex steroids, uterine afferent neurotransmission). The present results provide the first indication that the full manifestation of pregnancy-induced analgesia also requires a supraspinal component. The analgesia of gestation or its hormonal simulation (via estrogen and progesterone administration; HSP) is substantially attenuated (>/=60%) following blockade of spinal alpha(2) (but not alpha(1)) adrenergic receptors. HSP antinociception is also attenuated by transection of the hypogastric nerve, the magnitude of which is indistinguishable from that produced by spinal alpha(2) receptor blockade. Additionally, hypogastric neurectomy abolishes the component of the antinociception associated with HSP that is mediated by spinal alpha(2) receptors. This suggests that the augmented spinal noradrenergic activity during HSP is not due to activation at the terminal of noradrenergic spinal projection neurons but requires supraspinal activity. It is suggested that enhanced spinal noradrenergic activity amplifies ongoing spinal kappa/delta antinociception as has been observed following the concomitant intrathecal application of alpha(2) and opioid agonists. The current observations underscore the importance of visceral afferent activity as well as its modulation by a female-specific hormonal milieu to the efficacy of endogenous spinal opioid antinociception.",

Acceptable validation data was also obtained for recovery, linearity, and for both short and long-term injection precision.", 
    "113": "Capillary electrophoresis methods for the enantioresolution of two beta-blockers possessing two chiral centers--labetalol and nadolol--were developed using electrokinetic chromatography. These methods were based on the addition of sulfated beta-cyclodextrins (S-betaCD) as chiral selectors to the background electrolyte (BGE). Different operating parameters (pH and ionic strength of the BGE, concentration of S-beta-CD) were investigated using a normal or reversed polarity mode. A complete resolution of the four isomers of labetalol was obtained either at the cathode or at the anode according to the pH of the BGE. The resolution of nadolol was observed whatever polarity of the applied voltage but a baseline separation of the four enantiomers within a time of analysis appropriate to routine assay was only obtained at the anode. This optimal separation was performed using high concentrations of chiral additive in an acidic pH buffer of low molarity. Besides the complete enantiomeric separation of the beta-blockers studied, the interest of the proposed methods is to permit a reversal of the migration order of the different enantiomers. This could be of high interest in quality control for the study of enantiomeric purity, which is now required for the development of drugs and chemicals.",

However, they could be safely administered to 40% and 70% of these patients, respectively. Furthermore, most of these patients are receiving doses far below those found beneficial in clinical trials.

    "123": "The cardiotoxic effect of isoproterenol (ISO) is associated with, and possibly due to, calcium overload. Prior work suggests that calcium entry into cardiac myocytes after ISO administration occurs in two phases: an early rapid phase, followed by a slow phase beginning about 1 hour after ISO injection, leading to a peak myocardial calcium level after about 4 hours. We have tested the relationship of these phases to myocardial necrosis (MN) by determining the time after ISO administration at which the commitment to MN occurs. This was done by administration of propranolol at various times before and after ISO. In addition, since ISO induces lipolysis, and lipids can be toxic, experiments were conducted to determine if adrenergically-activated lipolysis could play a significant role in ISO-MN. We found that propranolol protected the myocardium equally well when administered anytime within 2 hours of ISO injection, but had no effect when given 4 hours after ISO. This showed that metabolic events taking place more than two hours after ISO injection are required for ISO-MN. As expected from prior work, there was a small and consistent amount of propranolol-resistant ISO-MN. Lipolysis, assessed by measuring serum glycerol levels, increased to tenfold above base line at one hour after ISO administration and returned to near basal levels at 4 hours. Potentiation of lipolysis by intravenous injections of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to rats treated with ISO substantially augmented MN. Propranolol completely blocked the increase in necrosis produced by PLA2 when given with ISO. Lipases induced only minimal necrosis in the absence of ISO. Administration of adenosine (an anti-lipolytic agent), oxfenicine (an inhibitor of mitochondrial palmitoyl carnitine transferase), or vitamin C (an anti-oxidant) resulted in a 55-60% reduction in MN. These results suggest that critical necrosis-determining events occur between 2 and 4 hours after ISO administration and imply a relationship between ISO-induced lipolysis, calcium influx, and ISO-MN. We hypothesize that importance of lipolysis as a determinant of ISO-MN is related to the generation of free fatty acids, their oxidized/metabolic products, or direct damage to plasma membrane.", 
    "124": "Administration of propranolol provokes bronchoconstriction only in asthmatic patients. It is unknown whether bronchodilator therapy can prevent the propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB). We previously reported an animal model of PIB in which bronchoconstriction is caused by propranolol when inhaled 20 minutes after an antigen provocation in passively sensitized guinea pigs. Our goal was to evaluate the bronchoprotective effects of bronchodilators on the PIB in our animal model. Propranolol was inhaled 20 minutes after an antigen challenge in passively sensitized, anesthetized, and artificially ventilated guinea pigs. Atropine (5 mg/kg) and equipotent doses of salbutamol (0.6 microgram/kg) and aminophylline (25 mg/kg), which were determined by the dose-response curves for inhibition of histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, were intravenously administered 5 minutes before the propranolol inhalation. Treatment of the animals with 25 mg/kg of aminophylline, but not with 0.6 microgram/kg of salbutamol or 5 mg/kg of atropine, significantly prevented the PIB. These results show that our animal model is an experimental model of PIB which is resistant to beta 2-agonists or anticholinergics and suggest that aminophylline may be useful to prevent and treat PIB resistant to beta 2-agonists.",

The AT4 receptor has a high affinity for Ang IV (Ki in rabbit myocardium < 2 x 10(-9)) and similar ligands, but very low affinity for Ang II (Ki in rabbit myocardium > 10(-6)). Although several functions have been attributed to the novel Ang IV peptide/AT4 receptor system, the effect of this system on left ventricular (LV) function has not been studied.

Inhibition of NO synthase did not alter the effect of Nle1-Ang IV on LV systolic function or relaxation.", 
    "129": "AT4 receptor agonism has mixed effects on LV systolic function, depressing pressure-generation and ejection capabilities, but enhancing the sensitivity of pressure development to volume change. It also speeds relaxation. The effect of Ang IV on systolic function is generally opposite to the effect of Ang II, whereas the Ang IV influence on relaxation is similar to the effect of Ang II.", 
    "130": "We have shown that rapid atrial activation, as occurs during atrial fibrillation (AF), reduces L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) and that this is the principal mechanism of the action potential duration and refractoriness changes that characterize tachycardia-induced atrial remodeling. The present study was designed to determine whether atrial tachycardia alters biochemical indices of the number of L-type Ca2+ channels and/or of the number and binding affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "131": "In canine atrial sarcolemmal preparations, the number and binding affinity of dihydropyridine receptors were determined with the use of 3H-nitrendipine and that of beta-adrenergic receptors with 125I-iodocyanopindolol. Results were obtained with preparations from dogs paced at 400/min for 1 (P1, n = 20), 7 (P7, n = 9), and 42 (P42, n = 9) days, and compared with observations in sham-operated controls (P0, n = 14).",

The affinity of dihydropyridine receptors was unchanged, with the Kd averaging 711 +/- 102 pM. 656 +/- 74 pM, 633 +/- 155 pM and 585 +/- 92 pM in P0, P1, P7 and P42 dogs. Neither Bmax nor Kd of beta-adrenergic receptors was altered by rapid pacing. Values of Bmax of dihydropyridine receptors correlated with atrial ICa current density (r2 = 0.95) and ERP (r2 = 0.99).", 
    "133": "Rapid atrial activation results in downregulation in the number of dihydropyridine receptors without altering the number or affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors. The reductions in ICa that play an important role in the atrial electrical remodeling by which 'AF begets AF' appear to be due at least in part to a decrease in the number of L-type Ca2+ channels in cardiac cell membranes.",

Intraocular pressures were obtained with either a Tono-Pen (Mentor Ophthalmics, Santa Barbara, Calif.) or applanation tonometer. Minimum follow-up times on acetazolamide and on dorzolamide were 1 month (mean 12.2 +/- 19.7 months) and 2 months (mean 8.2 +/- 5.1 months), respectively. The average dose of acetazolamide was 9.9 +/- 1.8 mg/kg/day.",

Indications for crossover from oral to topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (CAI) therapy were intolerance to acetazolamide (6 eyes) and surgical intervention in the fellow eye (5 eyes). The mean age at the time of crossover was 7.4 +/- 3.0 years. A comparison of intraocular pressure (IOP) before addition of a CAI was made in 8 eyes. The mean IOP off of a CAI was 27.8 +/- 4.9 mm Hg. The mean 10P was reduced to 18.5 +/- 4.3 mm Hg on acetazolamide (mean percent IOP reduction 35.7% +/- 15.6%, p < 0.01) and to 22.2 +/- 5.4 mm Hg on dorzolamide (mean percent IOP reduction 27.4% +/- 17.1%, p < 0.01).

    "138": "We examined the subtype-selective binding site of the beta-adrenergic receptors (betaARs). The beta(1)/beta(2)-chimeric receptors showed the importance of the second and seventh transmembrane domains (TM2 and TM7) of the beta(2)AR for the binding of the beta(2)-selective agonists such as formoterol and procaterol. Alanine-substituted mutants of TM7 of the beta(2)AR showed that Tyr(308,) located at the top of TM7, mainly contributed to beta(2) selectivity. However, Tyr(308) interacted with formoterol and procaterol in two different ways. The results of Ala- and Phe-substituted mutants indicated that the phenyl group of Tyr(308) interacted with the phenyl group in the N-substituent of formoterol (hydrophobic interaction), and the hydroxyl group of Tyr(308) interacted with the protonated amine of procaterol (hydrophilic interaction). In contrast to beta(2)AR, TM2 is a major determinant that beta(1)-selective agonists such as denopamine and T-0509 bound the beta(1)AR with high affinity. Three amino acids (Leu(110), Thr(117), and Val(120)) in TM2 of the beta(1)AR were identified as major determinants for beta(1)-selective binding of these agonists. Three-dimensional models built on the basis of the predicted structure of rhodopsin showed that Tyr(308) of the beta(2)AR covered the binding pocket formed by TM2 and TM7 from the upper side, and Thr(117) of the beta(1)AR located in the middle of the binding pocket to provide a hydrogen bonding for the beta(1)-selective agonists. These data indicate that TM2 and TM7 of the betaAR formed the binding pocket that binds the betaAR subtype-selective agonists with high affinity.", 
    "139": "To identify and localize the dopamine receptor subtypes in rabbit lacrimal gland which mediate protein secretion, the effects were determined of different dopamine receptor subtype agonists, antagonists, and a beta adrenergic antagonist on this process. Protein secretion into the medium was quantified with the Bradford assay. Dopamine increased protein secretion between 10(-7) and 10(-4)M, and it could be maintained for a subsequent 80 min. The relatively selective D1-like receptor agonist, SKF-38393 (10(-4)M) had a similar effect which was suppressed by the D1-like receptor antagonist, SCH-23390. However, neither the D2-like receptor agonist, quinpirole (10(-4)M), nor the selective D2-like receptor antagonist, sulpiride (10(-4)M) altered either the basal level or the stimulated response to dopamine. The dopamine (10(-4)M)-elicited increases in protein secretion were completely suppressed in the presence of either 10(-4)M propranolol or 10(-4)M bretylium. Protein secretion in rabbit lacrimal gland is mediated by dopaminergic nerves through stimulation of the presynaptic D1-like receptor.",

We evaluated latanoprost 0.005% (2.5 ml bottle), brimonidine 0.2%, apraclonidine 0.5%, dorzolamide 2%, timolol solution 0.5% (5 and 10 ml bottles), and timolol gel forming solution 0.5% (5 ml bottle) in 14 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Each patient placed 10 drops onto an analytical scale (one drop every 10 seconds) for all ten preparations. Patients then attempted to instill 10 drops of a tear replacement solution into their ocular cul-de-sac. Medication bottles were weighed before and after patients dispensed from the bottle and then after the bottle was emptied. Weights were converted to volume using the density of the medicine. A statistical difference existed between groups for mean drop volume with latanoprost having the smallest drop volume (.0273 +/- .004 ml) (P<0.005). All manufacturers filled correctly or overfilled their bottles with product and had <10% of medicine wasted. Patients instilled 77.9% of the tear solution correctly. When dosed according to labeling, latanoprost had the lowest cost of therapy at $0.87 daily compared to the other newly released medications (range $1.05 to $1.40). Latanoprost was more expensive, however, than timolol maleate solution or gel (range $0.45 to $0.54 per day). Latanoprost therapy is less expensive per day than dorzolamide, brimonidine or apraclonidine, but more expensive than timolol maleate. Cost per day could be further reduced by limiting medicine wastage upon instillation, however.",

Intraocular pressure was measured before and 2 hours after the morning dose of study medication (hour 0 and hour 2).", 
    "143": "In both studies, among patients with a preference, the combination was preterred to timolol plus pilocarpine by a ratio of 4 to 1. The most commonly cited reason for this preference was side effects. Patients in both studies also reported that the combination interfered significantly less with daily life in terms of side effects and activity limitations. They also reported missing significantly fewer doses of study medication while taking the combination and being significantly more satisfied with it. The efficacy of these two treatments was not significantly different, based on IOP measurements at hour 0 and 2 hours after administration. Patients reported significantly more adverse events while receiving timolol plus pilocarpine in both studies, and in the U.S. study, significantly more patients discontinued therapy while receiving timolol plus pilocarpine than while receiving the combination.",

    "145": "Cl(-) channels in the basolateral membrane of parietal cells within isolated rat gastric glands were studied by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The membrane potential (E(m)) of non-stimulated parietal cells changed as a function of the basolateral extracellular Cl(-) concentration (46 mV per decade), but E(m) did not change significantly as a function of the K(+) concentration. The extracellular addition of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2); 10 microM) increased the whole-cell Cl(-) current. A bifunctional prostaglandin EP3 agonist/EP1 antagonist, 5(Z)-7-[(1S, 2S,3S,5R)-3-(trans-beta-styren)sulfonamido-6,6-dimethylbi cyclo-(3.1. 1)hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic acid (ONO-NT-012; 10 microM), also increased the Cl(-) current. Basal Cl(-) currents and the PGE(2)- and ONO-NT-012-increased Cl(-) currents were voltage-independent and inhibited by a Cl(-) channel blocker, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoate (NPPB), at 500 microM. The single Cl(-) channel conductance was estimated to be 0.29 picosiemens (pS) by variance noise analysis. Both PGE(2) and ONO-NT-012 increased intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration in the fura-2-loaded parietal cell transiently. The present study has shown that housekeeping sub-pS Cl(-) channels are present in the basolateral membrane of rat parietal cell, and that the channels are regulated positively by PGE(2) via the EP3 receptor.", 
    "146": "The effects of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic agonists on Cl(-) currents in acinar cells were investigated to clarify their role in the regulation of fluid secretion in rat perfused submandibular glands. Additions of isoproterenol (IPR) at 10(-8) to 10(-6) M and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cyclic AMP (CPT-cAMP) at 10(-3) M to the perfusate suppressed carbachol (CCh; 10(-6) M)-induced fluid secretion. IPR and CPT-cAMP also diminished CCh-induced oscillatory Cl(-) current and increased CCh-stimulated non-oscillatory Cl(-) current. Propranolol blocked the effect of IPR on fluid secretion. IPR did not modulate the CCh-induced increase in intracellular concentration of calcium ions and intracellular pH in isolated cells. Propranolol blocked IPR-induced changes in Cl(- )currents, while propranolol itself increased CCh-induced K(+) current and reduced CCh-induced oscillatory Cl(-) current. Increasing external osmolarity with 50 mM sucrose abolished IPR-enhanced non-oscillatory Cl(-) current. Neither CCh-induced oscillatory Cl(-) current nor IPR-induced suppression of the oscillatory Cl(-) current was influenced by the hypertonicity. Perfusion of the gland with the hypertonic solution did not affect the IPR-induced suppression of fluid secretion. These results suggest that IPR induces the suppression of CCh-induced oscillatory Cl(-) current and potentiation of the non-oscillatory Cl(-) current via an increase in cyclic AMP level, and that suppression of the oscillatory Cl(-) current by IPR may contribute to the inhibition of fluid secretion from submandibular glands.", 
    "147": "The Caco-2 cell monolayer has become an increasingly useful in-vitro model of human intestinal absorption. In this study we have determined the effect of plasma on the basolateral side on the absorption as well as exsorption of several drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins. The drugs used included propranolol and quercetin, which both use the transcellular route of absorption, and taxol and oestradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, which are thought to undergo efflux by P-glycoprotein and the multidrug resistance protein MRP, respectively. All experiments were carried out under sink conditions to mimic normal absorption. It was necessary to use heparin anticoagulation for generation of the plasma, as EDTA was found to make the monolayers very leaky. The apparent permeability (P(app)) values for absorption were 1.54 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) for oestradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, 3.33 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) for taxol, 20.8 x 10(-6) cm s (-1) for quercetin, and 35.3 x 10(-6) cm s(-1) for propranolol. For these four compounds, plasma on the basolateral side had no influence on absorption. However, plasma on the basolateral side significantly reduced the efflux of oestradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide by 66%, taxol by 75%, propranolol by 82%, and quercetin by 94%. Failure to consider the effect of plasma binding can result in an overestimate of basolateral to apical efflux and result in misleading net flux calculations.", 
    "148": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) of percutaneous absorption enhancement of propranolol hydrochloride (PHCL) across porcine epidermis by terpenes (e.g. menthone and limonene) in combination with ethanol. The in vitro percutaneous absorption experiments were performed using Franz diffusion cells. The solubility of PHCL in control and enhancer solutions was determined through high-performance liquid chromatography. Partitioning of PHCL to powdered SC from control or enhancer solutions was also determined in order to investigate the binding of PHCL to the SC from the SC/enhancer system. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was employed to study the biophysical changes in stratum corneum (SC) lipids. The in vitro macroscopic barrier properties were investigated by measuring transepidermal water loss (TEWL) using Tewameter. Five percent menthone or limonene in combination with ethanol (EtOH) (menthone/EtOH or limonene/EtOH) significantly increased (P<0.05) the flux of PHCL through porcine epidermis in comparison to the control (EtOH). The partitioning of PHCL to the SC from the SC/enhancer system was also significantly greater than the SC/control system. The above enhancers showed a decrease in the peak heights and areas for both asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching absorbances in comparison with the untreated SC, indicating the SC lipids extraction. Menthone/EtOH and limonene/EtOH enhanced (P<0.05) the in vitro TEWL through the epidermis in comparison to the control. Thus, an enhancement in the flux of PHCL by menthone/EtOH and limonene/EtOH is due to SC lipid extraction, macroscopic barrier perturbation, and improvement in the partitioning of the drug to the SC.",

    "156": "Our aim was to investigate the association of calcium channel blocker (CCB), beta-blocker, and ACE inhibitor medications with the risk of depression in diabetic patients. A case-control study was performed using an automated database (MediPlus, IMS) of 400 primary care practices in Germany including 972 diabetic cases with newly diagnosed depression in 1996 (index date) and 972 diabetic controls, matched for age, sex, and index date. The odds ratios (95%-confidence intervals) for depression, adjusted for type of practice, number of visits and prescriptions, hospitalization, cardiovascular diagnoses, and renal failure, were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.2-4.2) for exposure to CCB 6 months prior to index date, 2.6 (95% CI: 1.1-7.0) for beta-blockers, and 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.2) for ACE inhibitors, respectively. Adjusted odds ratio for CCB (4.3; 95% CI: 1.7-13.5) and beta-blockers (4.5; 95% CI: 1.2-29.5) were higher with daily dosages above the median. Prescriptions of CCB and beta-blockers among diabetic patients may increase the risk of depression. Because this association may alternatively be explained by cardiovascular comorbidity, further studies will be necessary to investigate the link between these cardiovascular medications and depression.", 
    "157": "The study was undertaken to investigate the effect of metoprolol CR/XL on all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV. In all, 3,991 patients in NYHA class II-IV who were stable on standard medical treatment, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis, were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL or placebo and uptitrated from 12.5 or 25 mg to 200 mg over an 8-week period and were planned to be followed for a period of 2 years. The study was stopped earlier than planned due to the significant benefit achieved with metoprolol CR/XL on all-cause mortality. Treatment with metoprolol CR/XL was associated with a 34% decrease in all-cause mortality, 38% decrease in cardiovascular mortality, 41% decrease in sudden death, and 49% decrease in death due to progressive heart failure. The average dose of metoprolol CR/XL at the end of the study was 159 mg, and 64% of the patients were receiving 200 mg of metoprolol CR/XL. There was no significant difference in the placebo and active treatment group with regard to permanent discontinuation. Treatment of patients in NYHA class II-IV with metoprolol CR/XL is associated with a significant decrease in total mortality.", 
    "158": "Recent investigations have indicated that chronic heart failure can be reversed with agents that inhibit the reninangiotensin-aldosterone or sympathetic nervous system, such as angiontensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers. A meta-analysis of clinical trials of ACE inhibition in chronic heart failure reported reductions in mortality ranging from 13 to 33%, but as ACE inhibitors do not block chronic noradrenergic stimulation of the heart, mortality remains unacceptably high. Beta blockers have been shown to increase left ventricular ejection fraction, reduce end-systolic and end-diastolic cardiac dimensions, improve quality of life, and reduce mortality. All-cause mortality in the US Carvedilol trial was reduced 65%, and in MERIT-HF there was a 49% reduction in mortality from heart failure among patients receiving metoprolol CR/XL. MERIT-HF was ended early because of evidence of survival benefit. Although certain effects of beta blockers may be considered class effects, it is not yet clear whether there are differences between beta 1-selective antagonists and nonselective agents. The benefits conferred across differences in disease severity, race, and age should be answered as large ongoing and planned clinical trials of beta blockers are completed.", 
    "159": "Enhanced and sustained cardiac adrenergic drive occurs in heart failure (HF) and contributes, in part, to the progression of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and remodeling that are characteristic of this disease state. Enhanced sympathetic drive in HF can lead to downregulation and desensitization of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors with a consequent impairment of myocardial reserve and exercise tolerance. This sympathoadrenergic maladaptation can also lead to cellular abnormalities in the failing heart, manifested by defects in calcium handling of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, by defects in myocardial energetics, and by ongoing loss of cardiomyocytes through necrosis or apoptosis. Chronic treatment with beta blockers in patients with HF and in animals with experimentally induced HF has been shown to reverse, prevent, or, at the least, arrest many, if not all, of these adverse processes. Beta blockers improve function of the failing LV, prevent or reverse progressive LV dilation, chamber sphericity, and hypertrophy, and consequently have positive impact on cardiac remodeling. Beta blockers also reduce heart rate and LV wall stress, leading to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption, a clear benefit to the failing heart. Beta blockers can also improve the intrinsic contractile function of cardiomyocytes and have also been shown to improve myocardial energetics in HF, possibly through desirable changes in substrate utilization. Recent studies from our laboratories have also shown that beta blockers can attenuate cardiomyocyte apoptosis in HF. These benefits provide strong reinforcement to the clinical findings that beta blockers are highly beneficial for the management of patients with chronic HF and, when properly used, afford unequivocal reductions in mortality and morbidity in this patient population. At present, there is general agreement that increased cardiac sympathetic drive occurs in HF and may potentially be an important contributor to the progression of LV dysfunction and chamber remodeling that is characteristic of this disease state. Experimental studies in animal models of HF as well as clinical studies in patients with HF have suggested that chronic therapy with beta blockade is effective in preventing the progression of LV dysfunction and remodeling, the latter evidenced by reversal and/or prevention of progressive LV dilation and chamber sphericity. Results of recent multicenter clinical trials support these findings and have made it abundantly clear that long-term therapy with beta blockade inhibits clinical progression and has a major impact on mortality and morbidity in patients with HF that is at least as favorable, if not better, than that observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Beta blockers improve mortality and morbidity in HF and also improve LV ejection fraction (EF), a beneficial feature that, until recently, has only been attributed to positive inotropic agents.", 
    "160": "Beta blockers have been shown to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death in more than 50 randomized trials involving more than 55,000 patients. Relative reductions (vs. placebo) in cardiac death in some of these trials ranged from 30 to 50%. These reductions are substantially greater than trials of other drug classes including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. However, not all beta blockers confer equal benefit to patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. Results from various trials suggest that lipophilic beta blockers--such as timolol, metoprolol, propranolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol--may be more beneficial than hydrophilic beta blockers. Results of animal studies have indicated that sudden cardiac death is mediated, at least in part, by the central nervous system, which may account for why lipophilic agents have more pronounced clinical effects. Based on the results of numerous clinical and mechanistic studies, it is suggested that beta blockers should be given to all patients at risk for sudden cardiac death, including those patients with previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, or congestive heart failure.", 
    "161": "Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)(1A) receptor agonism and 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism are components in the action of some of the recently developed antipsychotic drugs, e.g., clozapine and ziprasidone. However, studies of the role of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism in the ability of these drugs to modulate dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), which may be relevant to antipsychotic action, are lacking. Thus, we examined the effect of clinically available agents, ipsapirone, a 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist, and the mixed 5-HT(1A/1B)/beta receptor antagonist S(-)-pindolol, on DA release in the NAC compared to the striatum (STR). Ipsapirone produced a biphasic effect; low dose (0.1 mg/kg) decreased, high dose (3 mg/kg) increased and intermediate doses (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) did not change DA release in the NAC, respectively. However, ipsapirone, at all doses (0.3, 1, 3, but not 0.1 mg/kg) increased striatal DA release. S(-)-pindolol (3, 10, but not 1 mg/kg) produced a comparable increase in DA release in the NAC and STR. These results suggest that the ability of lower dose of ipsapirone to decrease DA release in the NAC is more likely to be due to 5-HT(1A) receptor agonism. On the other hand, the effect of higher dose of ipsapirone on striatal DA release may be due to 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonism, as is the case with S(-)-pindolol. The mechanism and clinical significance of these results for developing antipsychotic drugs is discussed.", 
    "162": "The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability (HRV) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). After a 3- to 4-week titration period, carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily, or the highest dose tolerated (at least 25mg daily). Maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks. Digital 24-hour Holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy. HRV for the entire 24-hour period was computed in the time domain using the Oxford Medilog Excel 2 analysis system. Measures of HRV included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats (RRm), the standard deviation of all normal RR intervals (SDNN), the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals (rMSSD), and the proportion of adjacent normal RR intervals differing >50 ms (pNN50). Additional treatment with carvedilol induced a significant increase in HRV: SDNN increased from 77+/-21 ms to 110+/-22 ms (p=0.001), rMSSD from 19+/-7 ms to 26+/-7 ms (p=0.02), and mean pNN50-value increased from 1.7+/-1.3% to 5.5+/-4.5% (p<0.01) under therapy with carvedilol. Mean heart rate on carvedilol calculated over 24 hours was 13 beats less than at baseline (75 bpm versus 88 bpm, p<0.01). After 2 months of additional treatment with carvedilol, both hemodynamic and clinical parameters improved: left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 24+/-7% to 30+/-10% (p<0.05), and New York Heart Association class decreased from 2.5+/-0.8 to 1.8+/-0.7 (p<0.05). In summary, eight weeks of additional carvedilol therapy induced a significant increase in HRV parameters related to parasympathetic activity in patients with IDC. Whether increased vagal tone may contribute to the protective effect of carvedilol has to be evaluated by further studies."
