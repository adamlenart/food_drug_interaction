    "0": "1. Isoprenaline (0.02 to 2.0 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) inhibited gastric secretion in response to pentagastrin in both conscious and anaesthetized dogs and in response to feeding in conscious dogs.2. The inhibition was unaffected during cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade by propranolol.3. The inhibition was not due to decreased mucosal blood flow.4. This effect of isoprenaline is different from its effect on histamine-induced gastric secretion.5. Noradrenaline (0.05-2.0 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) also decreased gastric secretion but it was less effective than isoprenaline.6. The mechanism of action of noradrenaline is probably a decrease in mucosal blood flow.", 
    "1": "1. Postvagal tachycardia, the transient increase in heart rate that follows the sinus bradycardia elicited by vagal stimulation, was investigated in thirty chloralosed cats. Maximum postvagal tachycardia was elicited by stimulation at frequencies of 20-60 Hz with train durations of 30-90 sec. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the magnitudes of postvagal tachycardia and of the preceding sinus bradycardia.2. Postvagal tachycardia was not affected by either spinal transection at C7 or by administration of propranolol (1.5 mg/kg I.V.), but was abolished by the administration of atropine (2.0 mg/kg I.V.).3. Postvagal tachycardia was observed to follow the vagal bradycardia induced reflexly either by administration of phenyldiguanide (100-300 mug I.V.) or by stimulation of the aortic depressor nerve.4. In the isolated atria-vagus preparations from six rabbits a positive correlation was demonstrated between the magnitude of postvagal tachycardia and of the preceding bradycardia elicited by vagal stimulation.5. Continuous intracellular recordings were obtained from four sinuatrial node pace-maker cells in the isolated atria-vagus preparation of the rabbit before, during and after vagal stimulation. During postvagal tachycardia the slope of the diastolic prepotential, the maximum diastolic potential, threshold potential and the overshoot were found to be increased; these changes are different from those found in pace-maker cells during adrenergic activation.6. These findings demonstrate that postvagal tachycardia is not mediated by sympathetic adrenergic mechanisms, but suggest that it is dependent upon the preceding vagal bradycardia and may be related to an increase in net sodium influx into pace-maker cells initiated by the hyperpolarization of the pace-maker cell membrane during and immediately after vagal stimulation.", 
    "2": "The beta-adrenoceptor in pig coronary vascular smooth muscle has been characterized by the use of a selective agonist, salbutamol and a selective antagonist, practolol. In coronary artery strips contracted with KCI, salbutamol had only marginal relaxant activity and was a partial agonist compared with isoprenaline. Practolol had relatively high antagonist potency against isoprenaline (pA(2) 6.59). It is concluded that the pig coronary vascular,beta-adrenoceptor is of the beta(1)-type.", 
    "3": "1. The effect of electrical stimulation of the distal cut ends of the renal nerves of unilaterally nephrectomized, anaesthetized cats was studied. Using stimulation parameters of 15 pulses per second (pps), 15 V and 0.2 msec duration, there was an immediate sharp drop in renal blood flow, as determined by an electromagnetic flowmeter, which was maintained for about 2 min. Flow gradually returned to control values over approximately the next 10 min in spite of continued stimulation for up to 30 min.2. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased markedly after 10 min of stimulation but 20 min later fell towards pre-stimulation values whether stimulation was maintained or not.3. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonist, abolished both the blood flow and PRA responses to a 10 min period of renal nerve stimulation.4. When the renal artery was constricted in order to produce blood flow changes similar to those found with renal nerve stimulation, the rise in PRA was similar to that observed with renal stimulation.5. In phentolamine-blocked animals, renal artery constriction, as described, produced the same effect on PRA as was observed with renal nerve stimulation.6. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic-receptor antagonist, did not block the blood flow response to renal nerve stimulation, but did block the rise in PRA normally associated with renal nerve stimulation.7. It is suggested that the effect of renal nerve stimulation on PRA is mediated, primarily, by changes in renal blood flow and that one of the steps leading to renin release following stimulation is sensitive to propranolol. This step must be distal to the effect on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "4": "1. Evidence is presented to elucidate the nature of the adrenergic mechanisms involved in responses of the guinea-pig to anaphylatoxin (AT).2. Investigation by means of adrenalectomy, adrenergic neurone blockade, alpha- and beta- adrenoceptor blockade and exclusion of autonomic reflexes, revealed that the adrenergic mechanisms provoked included catecholamine release from the adrenal medulla, sympathetic reflex activity, stimulation of adrenergic neurones and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor activity.3. The cardiovascular effects of AT, mediated by histamine release, were largely attributable to adrenal medullary and adrenergic neuronal mechanisms. These mechanisms also exerted a restraint on the predominantly histamine mediated bronchoconstrictor effect of AT.4. The cardiovascular effects of AT activity, not attributable to histamine release, were also probably associated with catecholamine release. However, the bronchoconstrictor component of this AT activity was not significantly affected by guanethidine, and it would, therefore, appear that neuronal bronchodilator mechanisms did not exert a restraint upon this aspect of AT activity.5. These findings are generally compatible with previous work showing that adrenergic mechanisms operate during AT-induced responses. In contrast to previous reports, however, the adrenergic activity was predominantly associated with the effects of released histamine.", 
    "5": "The effect of propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, has been investigated on gastric acid secretion in pylorus and cardiac-ligated rats. Compared to the control group, propranolol significantly diminished the gastric acid secretion, and inhibited the formation of gastric ulceration.", 
    "6": "1. Stretching the atrial appendages in anaesthetized dogs caused an increase in heart rate. This response was unrelated to changes in arterial blood pressure and left and right atrial pressures.2. The increase in heart rate was a reflex response; the afferent path was in the vagi and the efferent solely in the sympathetic nerves.3. The receptors involved in this reflex have been localized to the atrial appendages but there is no conclusive evidence as to their nature."
