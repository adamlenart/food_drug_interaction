    "0": "The effect of pindolol (a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, ISA) on fasting plasma lipid profile in 30 hypertensive patients was compared with atenolol (without ISA) in a crossover single blind study. Both drugs lowered blood pressure. HDL-cholesterol increased significantly with pindolol (from 1.15 +/- 0.05 to 1.34 +/- 0.05 mmol/l at 12 weeks, P less than 0.001), but not with atenolol. VLDL-cholesterol increased with atenolol (from 0.57 +/- 0.09 to 0.86 +/- 0.14 mmol/l at 12 weeks, P less than 0.002), while there was no change with pindolol. These changes in lipoprotein profile suggest a more favourable effect of pindolol than of atenolol on lipid profile.", 
    "1": "Intravenous labetalol is commonly used in the management of hypertensive emergencies or urgencies as well as postoperative hypertension. The maximum recommended dose in any clinical setting is 300 mg in 24 hours. The safety of administering high doses of intravenous labetalol (greater than 300 mg in 24 hours) was evaluated in neurosurgical patients (n = 9). During 15 distinct periods of 24 hours or less, the mean dose of labetalol given was 623 +/- 86 mg. Adverse hemodynamic and biochemical effects were minor and easily reversible. Intravenous labetalol can safely be used in doses exceeding 300 mg per 24 hours in neurosurgical patients.", 
    "2": "The first-pass pulmonary extraction values of N-Isopropyl-123I-p-Iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) in pretreated dogs decreases from 90 to 62% as the amount of propranolol increases from 0 to 20 mg. The first-pass pulmonary extraction values of 123I-IMP in dogs with a simultaneous bolus injection of propranolol decreases from 90 to 62% as the amount of propranolol increases from 0 to 10 mg. The pulmonary extraction of 123I-IMP with a simultaneous bolus injection of ketamine and 123I-IMP decreases from 90 to 64% as the ketamine dose increases from 0 to 100 mg. These results suggest that the pulmonary uptake of 123I-IMP may be at least partially mediated by receptors. They also indicate that endothelial metabolic cell function may be a useful index of early lung pathology. Furthermore, studies of the degree of lung uptake may be a sensitive index of pathologic states in which alterations of amine binding sites have occurred.", 
    "3": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the role of increased beta-adrenergic activity in regulating the increase in myocardial oxygen consumption that occurs during hypoxemia in unanesthetized newborn lambs. Through a left thoracotomy, fluid-filled catheters were placed in the ascending aorta, coronary sinus and left atrium, a pressure transducer was introduced into the left ventricle, and pacing wires were sutured onto the left atrium. The lambs were studied 3 d later by making intermittent measurements of aortic and coronary sinus blood oxygen saturations and Hb concentrations, left ventricular myocardial blood flow, cardiac output, heart rate, left atrial and aortic blood pressures, the maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure, aortic and coronary sinus blood oxygen contents, the arteriovenous difference of oxygen across the left ventricular myocardium, myocardial oxygen consumption, and external cardiac work (aortic mean blood pressure times cardiac output). In nine lambs with an intact beta-adrenergic nervous system (group 1), the above measurements were made during a control period and during hypoxemia (FiO2 = 0.08-0.10) with spontaneous tachycardia. In another group of 12 lambs (group 2), the measurements were made during a control period, after beta-blockade (1.5 mg/kg intravenous propranolol) with pacing at the control heart rate, during hypoxemia with pacing at the control heart rate, and during hypoxemia with pacing-induced tachycardia. In the group 2 lambs, beta-blockade completely inhibited the increase in heart rate, maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure, cardiac output and cardiac work that occurred during hypoxemia in the group 1 lambs that had an intact beta-adrenergic nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The present primary prevention study aimed at investigating whether metoprolol given as initial antihypertensive treatment would lower cardiovascular complications of high blood pressure to a greater extent than thiazide diuretics. Patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 1,609, 8,110 patient-years) or a thiazide diuretic (n = 1,625, 8,070 patient-years). At randomization, 535 patients in the metoprolol group and 524 patients in the diuretic group were classified as smokers. Blood pressure control during follow-up was equally effective regardless of smoking habits at randomization. Cardiovascular and coronary heart disease mortality was three to four times higher in smokers than in nonsmokers, underlining the importance of smoking as a risk factor. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for the metoprolol group than for the thiazide diuretic group in the whole study population (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012), as well as in smokers (p = 0.013 and p = 0.016). Coronary heart disease mortality was significantly lower for patients on metoprolol than for patients on diuretics in the whole study population (p = 0.048) as well as in smokers (p = 0.021). The results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of total, cardiovascular, and coronary heart disease mortality as compared with initial diuretic treatment, both in the whole study population and in smokers. The favorable effect of metoprolol must be mediated via mechanisms other than the blood pressure-lowering effect of metoprolol because equal blood pressure control was achieved with both types of medication, irrespective of smoking habits at randomization.", 
    "5": "This study evaluated the effects of topical isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, on the morphologic damage produced in the gastric mucosa by ethanol. The orogastric instillation of 100% ethanol in rats resulted in gross lesion formation and deep histologic injury in the gastric mucosa. Animals pretreated with oral isoproterenol (50 micrograms/kg, 500 micrograms/kg, 50 mg/kg) showed dose-dependent protection from both the gross and the histologic mucosal injury (P less than 0.01, ANOVA). Pretreatment with propranolol (2 mg/kg/sec) but not indomethacin (5 mg/kg/sec) blocked this protective effect. Isoproterenol had no effect on ethanol-induced mast cell degranulation as both mucosal and submucosal mast cell counts were significantly and equally decreased in all groups treated with 100% ethanol (P less than 0.05). These findings show that topical isoproterenol protects the rat gastric mucosa from both the gross and the histologic injury caused by 100% ethanol. This protection is mediated by a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism as it can be blocked by prior treatment with propranolol, but does not involve stabilization of mucosal or submucosal mast cell membranes.", 
    "6": "The effects of topical timolol maleate 0.5% on the ophthalmic artery diastolic (OABPd), systolic (OABPs) and mean blood pressure (OABPm) were investigated in 19 healthy subjects using compression ophthalmodynamometry. In a randomized, double-blind study, one eye of each subject received one drop of timolol maleate 0.5% and the fellow eye received a drop of placebo. Measurements of OABPd and OABPs were performed just prior to instillation of the drops, and then 2 hr later. OABPm was calculated as OABPm = OABPd + 1/3 (OABPs - OABPd). No significant changes in OABPd, OABPs or OABPm were observed following the drops in the timolol-treated eyes or in the placebo-treated eyes. A significant difference (P = 0.0198) was found, however, when the changes in OABPm occurring in the timolol-treated eyes were compared with the changes occurring in the placebo-treated eyes, suggesting that the drug may have an effect upon ophthalmic artery pressure and retinal artery pressure that is expressed differently in each eye.", 
    "7": "Effects of intraarterial norepinephrine on cerebral hemodynamics were investigated in conscious newborn pigs. Intracarotid infusion of norepinephrine (100 ng/min) increased cerebral blood flow from 72 +/- 5 to 82 +/- 8 ml/100 g.min. The norepinephrine-induced increase in cerebral blood flow was accompanied by an increase in cerebral oxygen consumption from 2.75 +/- 0.17 to 3.11 +/- 0.29 ml O2/100 g.min. Both the increase in cerebral oxygen consumption and the increase in cerebral blood flow were blocked by propranolol and unchanged by combined prazosin and yohimbine treatment. These data show that intraarterial norepinephrine increases cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption in newborn pigs. beta-Adrenergic stimulation increases cerebral oxygen consumption. This increase may produce the increase in cerebral blood flow caused by the norepinephrine.", 
    "8": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the somatostatin analog octreotide in patients with orthostatic hypotension. Octreotide was administered sc, and its pressor effect was assessed while the patients were semirecumbent and on the tilt table. We also studied the effect of octreotide on blood pressure while patients walked. The efficacy of therapy was assessed by measuring the duration of walking (walking time) before the onset of hypotension. Low doses of octreotide (0.2-0.4 micrograms/kg) had a pressor effect in all patients with progressive autonomic failure (n = 7), multiple system atrophy (n = 7), and diabetic autonomic neuropathy (n = 8), but not in patients with sympathotonic orthostatic hypotension (n = 6). Larger doses (0.4-1.6 micrograms/kg) resulted in a sustained (greater than or equal to 50 min) increase in blood pressure during walking in four of six patients with progressive autonomic failure and in one of six patients with multiple system atrophy. Some patients in whom octreotide failed to stabilize upright blood pressure had a satisfactory response to the drug after pretreatment with dihydroergotamine (10 micrograms/kg, sc). Patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy, although sensitive to the pressor effect of octreotide, often developed nausea or abdominal cramps after moderate doses (greater than 1.0 micrograms/kg). These results indicate that the pressor effect of octreotide is sufficiently potent to prevent orthostatic hypotension in some patients with autonomic neuropathy. Others require treatment with both dihydroergotamine and octreotide to achieve a stable upright blood pressure.", 
    "9": "Betaxolol is a new antiglaucomatous drug which is blocking solely the beta 1 receptors and in contrast to Timolol may be applied in persons with spastic conditions of the bronchi. It has been given twice daily to 9 persons with glaucoma and long standing bronchial asthma. In the period of observation (1.5-6.5 months) neither of the examined patients showed any deterioration of the spirometric indexes nor bradycardia. In a part of the patients the intraocular pressure was normalized only by application of Betaxolol; over one half of them however needed additionally the use of miotics.", 
    "10": "Hemodynamic and humoral indices were studied in patients with juvenile hypertension before and after a months treatment course with obsidan. The beginning of the disease was in 18% distinguished by an increased thickness of the wall and interventricular septum. Obsidan treatment (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) resulted already during the first 2-4 weeks and then on the 3 and 6 month in an improvement of the general condition, normalization of the systolic pressure, cessation of tachycardia, reduction of the elevated cardiac index, reduction of the rate of circular shortening of the myocardial fibers, plasma renin activity and amount of blood aldosterone. Resistance to the effect of obsidan was noted in 10.5%. Some patients showed side-effects.", 
    "11": "In vitro effects of the phenethanolamine ractopamine on basal and insulin-stimulated lipid metabolism were determined in adipocytes isolated from epididymal fat pads of Sprague-Dawley rats. Ractopamine appeared to be equipotent to the catecholamine isoproterenol in stimulating basal lipolysis and inhibiting basal lipogenesis, producing maximum effects at 10(-6) M. Addition of a half-maximally stimulating dose of ractopamine (5 x 10(-8) M) to the incubation media decreased insulin sensitivity but not insulin responsiveness of the cells, stimulating lipolysis and inhibiting lipogenesis only in the presence of low media insulin concentrations. This effect was totally reversed by 10 microM/propranolol. Maximally effective concentrations of ractopamine (10(-6) M) significantly decreased both the sensitivity and responsiveness of the isolated adipocytes to insulin. Addition of 10 microM propranolol to the incubation media effectively reversed the lipolytic and anti-lipogenic effects of 10(-6) M ractopamine observed at media insulin concentrations greater than 25 microU/ml, whereas it only partially reduced the ractopamine-induced effects observed at lower insulin concentrations. The results demonstrate 1) that ractopamine has concentration-dependent effects on adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and responsiveness and 2) that these effects may be mediated, in part, through beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "12": "A general model for the illness-death stochastic process with covariates has been developed for the analysis of survival data. This model incorporates important baseline and time-dependent covariates in order to make an appropriate adjustment for the transition and survival probabilities. The follow-up period is subdivided into small intervals and a constant hazard is assumed for each interval. An approximation formula is derived to estimate the transition parameters when the exact transition time is unknown. The method developed is illustrated with data from a study on the prevention of the recurrence of a myocardial infarction and subsequent mortality, the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). This method provides an analytical approach with which the effectiveness of the treatment can be compared between the placebo and propranolol treatment groups with respect to fatal and nonfatal events simultaneously.", 
    "13": "The first-year results of a 5-year prospective randomized follow-up study on 39 glaucoma patients, of whom 19 patients received laser trabeculoplasty and 20 patients medication therapy as primary treatment of their newly detected open-angle glaucoma, are presented. The optic disc changes were recorded by measuring the magnification corrected neuroretinal rim area from stereoscopic optic disc photographs and the visual field changes with an automated perimeter. There were no statistically significant differences in success rate, intraocular pressure reduction, and optic disc or visual field changes between the two groups during the first year of follow-up. In half of the laser treated patients the intraocular pressure was below 22 mmHg without medication treatment. Many patients in the medication group required frequent modifications of their therapy. Laser trabeculoplasty has an important role as primary therapy in glaucoma.", 
    "14": "Metoprolol CR/ZOK (controlled release, zero order kinetics) is a new formulation of an extensively used beta 1-selective, beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, (beta 1-blocker), designed to provide continuous, even, plasma concentrations in the therapeutic range. It should, therefore, provide an effective well-tolerated treatment for hypertension and angina pectoris and for use in secondary prevention following a myocardial infarct. The purpose of this review is to consider the need for such a formulation, to describe its pharmaceutical development, review its pharmacology and assess its efficacy and tolerability compared with other available agents.", 
    "15": "An assessment of serotonin (5HT) release was made in bovine pineal gland. Bovine pineal fragments took up [3H]5HT by a Na+-dependent process exhibiting two apparent Km, i.e. a high affinity uptake system (Km = 220 nM) and a low affinity uptake system (Km = 197 microM). A significant release of [3H]5HT was elicited by increasing K+ concentrations in the medium (20-80 mM). Exposure of bovine pineal fragments to varying doses of catecholaminergic agonists indicated that a significant [3H]5HT release was elicited at the following threshold concentrations: 10(-6) M norepinephrine (NE), 10(-7) M dopamine (DA), 10(-6) phenylephrine and 10(-6) M isoproterenol. By employing specific receptor agonists and antagonists, the 5HT release activity of adrenergic agonists was found to be mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors, while that of DA by D2-dopaminergic receptors. 5HT release elicited by NE or DA, as well as that by 30 mM K+, was Ca2+-dependent. Both NE and DA increase 45Ca2+ uptake in a dispersed cell preparation of bovine pineal glands. As in the case of 5HT release, the effect of NE and DA on calcium uptake was mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors and D2-dopaminergic receptors, respectively. These results indicate that both NE and DA control 5HT release in bovine pineal gland.", 
    "16": "1. Many apparent actions of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) are mediated by adenosine produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of the nucleotide. Previously described actions of ATP in the CNS have been partly due to this phenomenon. In the present study analogues of ATP, which are not hydrolysed to adenosine, were used to seek responses to activating nucleotide (P2) receptors in the hippocampus. The analogues used were L-adenosine-5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)-triphosphonate and 2-methylthioadenosine-5'-(beta,gamma-difluoromethylene)-triphosphonat e. 2. Neither of the stable nucleotides had any effect on orthodromically evoked synaptic potentials in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. Adenosine and ATP had inhibitory actions that could be prevented by the P1-receptor blocker 8-phenyltheophylline. 3. The stable nucleotides had no consistent effects on the firing rate of single neurones in stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region, although adenosine and ATP produced a xanthine-sensitive inhibition. 4. Adenosine selectively reduced the sensitivity of CA1 neurones to microiontophoretically applied carbachol whereas stable nucleotides did not. 5. It is concluded that there are neither P2x- nor P2y-receptors for adenine nucleotides on rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells at the Schaffer collateral and commissural terminals in stratum radiatum.", 
    "17": "The effect of burn injury on blood sugar levels, serum insulin levels and glucose tolerance was studied in male rats. In the burned group (following 50 per cent surface burn injury), the blood sugar level was significantly increased after burn injury in comparison with control uninjured rats. Hyperglycaemia was blocked by injection of phentolamine (10 mg/kg) for 24 h or propranolol (50 micrograms/kg) 30 min before burn or if the animals were adrenalectomized 4 days before injury. Serum insulin levels were significantly decreased in the scalded rats and their glucose tolerance was impaired. Early hyperglycaemia probably arises as a result of adrenal medullary hyperactivity. The initial rise in blood glucose probably arises from glycogen breakdown, followed later by increased hepatic production of glucose. The 50 per cent body surface scald injury is followed, acutely, by a period of glucose intolerance. In part, this intolerance may be due to decreased serum levels of insulin. The inadequate response of insulin secretion in response to glucose loading may be due to inhibition of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells caused by elevated catecholamine levels, possibly in combination with the action of antagonists such as glucagon, which may be secreted in excess as a result of stimulation by catecholamines.", 
    "18": "Seventeen patients with hypertension and osteoarthritis participated in a single-blind crossover study comparing the effects of sulindac 200 mg twice daily, naproxen 500 mg twice daily, and placebo on blood pressure. All patients were treated for hypertension with propranolol monotherapy. Blood pressures were back-titrated to achieve a baseline diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 100 mm Hg while taking naproxen. There were no significant differences in mean sitting or standing blood pressures among the patients receiving naproxen, sulindac, or placebo treatments. There was no change in pulse, weight, or any of the laboratory measurements at the end of each treatment phase. These results suggest that neither sulindac nor naproxen interferes with propranolol therapy for uncomplicated hypertension.", 
    "19": "Labetalol is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist agent with added alpha 1-adrenergic blocking properties, beta 2-stimulating action, and direct vasodilatory activity. A multi-center, double-blind, parallel group study compared the safety and efficacy of labetalol to propranolol in the treatment of patients with both exertional angina and mild to moderate systemic hypertension. An initial 4 to 5 week placebo washout phase was followed by a five week titration phase and a four month maintenance phase. Labetalol and propranolol had similar effects in reducing supine and standing blood pressures, except for a greater reduction in standing systolic blood pressure seen in the labetalol group. There were comparable effects by both treatments on angina attacks, nitroglycerin use, and exercise tolerance. Adverse effects were frequent with both drugs, but were generally minor. Thus, labetalol appears to be an effective alternative to propranolol in the treatment of patients with coexisting angina pectoris and hypertension, with the choice of agent dependent on the clinical situation.", 
    "20": "The antihypertensive effect of 200 mg metoprolol per day was compared to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide over a period of four weeks. Metoprolol reduced mean arterial blood pressure from 120 +/- 13 mm Hg after placebo to 109 +/- 8 at the end of the study (n = 18; 38 +/- 12 years) (p less than 0.01). The corresponding values in the hydrochlorothiazide group were 119 +/- 13 mm Hg and 107 +/- 13 (n = 20; 33 +/- 12 years) (p less than 0.01). No significant difference between the groups was found for blood pressure at the end of the study. When blood pressure responders or non-responders of the metoprolol group were compared with the respective subgroup of the hydrochlorothiazide treated patients, no difference could be found for plasma renin activity as well as for aldosterone and PGE2- and PGF2a-excretion rates. However, when blood pressure responders were compared with non-responders within the same treatment group, plasma renin activity and PGE2-excretion rates were higher in the responder group corresponding with younger age in both treatments. Therefore high PGE2-excretion rate and high plasma renin activity might reflect a favorable vascular response to antihypertensive therapy. However, the hormonal analyses do not seem to help in the selection between a beta-blocker or a diuretic as a drug of first choice.", 
    "21": "The mechanism of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction (PIB) remains unclear. Previous uncontrolled studies have suggested that atropine antagonizes PIB in asthma. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of a new anticholinergic agent, oxitropium bromide, on bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled propranolol in seven subjects with mild asthma 24 to 39 yr of age. Inhaled propranolol induced long-lasting reduction in specific airway conductance (SGaw) in all subjects. This was associated with airway beta-adrenoceptor blockade as demonstrated by a shift in the isoproterenol dose-response curve. Propranolol was less potent than methacholine, with a geometric mean dose causing a 35% fall in SGaw of 4.7 mumol for propranolol compared with 0.48 mumol for methacholine. Pretreatment with oxitropium 200 micrograms completely inhibited the fall in SGaw in response to inhaled propranolol in all subjects. Oxitropium also revealed PIB. Cholinergic receptor blockade by oxitropium inhibits bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled propranolol, supporting involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in PIB.", 
    "22": "Dose-response relations with penbutolol--a beta-adrenergic blocking agent--were evaluated in a double-blind multiclinic study conducted in 302 outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension (untreated supine diastolic blood pressure [BP] greater than or equal to 95 and less than or equal to 115 mm Hg). Penbutolol was administered once daily in 10, 20 or 40 mg doses for 6 weeks and compared with placebo. Mean declines from baseline in supine diastolic BP were comparable in the 3 penbutolol treatment groups and significantly superior to placebo (p less than 0.05). A significant difference between penbutolol dosage groups was observed only for supine systolic BP; the mean decline at 20 mg/day was significantly larger than that at 10 mg/day (p less than 0.05). Maximum BP response developed in approximately 4 weeks at 10 mg/day and in 2 weeks at the higher dosages. Decline in mean heart rate after 6 weeks of penbutolol therapy significantly exceeded placebo only at 40 mg/day (7.2 vs 2.5 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Treatment was well-tolerated and discontinued because of adverse effects in only 7 patients receiving penbutolol and 3 receiving placebo. The lack of significant bradycardia and the low incidence of other troublesome adverse effects are potential advantages during antihypertensive therapy with penbutolol. With rapid onset of effect and good efficacy and tolerability, the 20 mg once-daily dose appears to be optimum for therapy with this new agent.", 
    "23": "A group of patients with hepatocirrhosis were studied for the speed of liver elimination of lidocaine iv (n = 11), propranolol per os (n = 8) and phenazone per os (n = 19); they were also studied for blood supply in liver by means of sequential hepatoscintigraphy. Ultrasonography was used to evaluate the portal system and collaterals of the collateral circulation, endoscopy was used to evaluate the size of oesophageal varices, lateral projection of scintigraphic picture made it possible to calculate the liver mass. The half-life of propranolol and lidocaine in the initial phase of elimination correlated with the degree of portal-arterial disorders in liver blood supply. Propranolol bioavailability correlated with the diameter of the portal vein and was dependent on the size of oesophageal varices and the presence of cavernous transformation of the portal vein. No correlation was found between hepatic clearance of phenazone and vascular pathology of cirrhotic liver, but positive correlation was found between clearance and liver mass. Morphological and functional examinations of the vascular system of the cirrhotic liver were of greater predicative value for the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of drugs than clinical progression of hepatocirrhosis in the Child-Turcott classification.", 
    "24": "1. The cardiovascular responses, heart rate and mean arterial pressure, were followed in seventeen human subjects who performed static handgrip contractions for 2 min at the same absolute force (15% of the initial maximal voluntary contraction strength) before and during partial curarization. In control contractions the rate of perceived exertion was 10 exertion units, 16 units in contractions with tubocurarine which could be maintained and 20 units in contractions that could not be maintained. Control contractions increased mean arterial pressure by 6 mmHg from 89 mmHg while heart rate was unchanged from the resting value of 68 beats min-1. With tubocurarine, larger increases in mean arterial pressure of 11 mmHg and for heart rate of 8 beats min-1 were obtained during maintained contractions, and 15 mmHg and 16 beats min-1, respectively, during non-maintained contractions. 2. Atropine increased resting heart rate and blood pressure with tubocurarine to 107 beats min-1 and 98 mmHg, respectively, in seven subjects. The blood pressure response to exercise with tubocurarine was unaffected by atropine, but the heart rate increase was reduced from 15 to 4 beats min-1. 3. Propranolol reduced resting heart rate with tubocurarine to 56 beats min-1 with no effect on blood pressure in seven subjects. The cardiovascular responses to exercise with tubocurarine were unaffected by propranolol. In contrast, phentolamine reduced resting blood pressure with tubocurarine to 80 mmHg without affecting heart rate in seven subjects. Exercise responses with tubocurarine were unaffected by phentolamine. Combinations of atropine and propranolol in fourteen subjects or atropine and phentolamine in five subjects showed similar results during exercise with tubocurarine as with the sole use of the agents used to block autonomic receptors. 4. The results suggest that when partial curarization induces a disproportion between the signal from central command and that from exercising muscles, the larger signal arising from central command determines the magnitude of the cardiovascular responses. The centrally generated heart rate response is in part caused by vagal withdrawal. However, the blood pressure response cannot be attenuated by the sole use of alpha- or beta-receptor adrenergic blockade or combinations of these with atropine. This suggests that there may be greater redundancy in the autonomic control of blood pressure than in the vagal control of heart rate associated with central command during static exercise in man.", 
    "25": "The efficacy of sustained-release propranolol 160 mg (Inderal LA), bendrofluazide 5 mg and the combination preparation Inderex (bendrofluazide 5 mg and Inderal LA) in the treatment of hypertension was investigated. Twenty-one patients over a wide age range were studied, as it was of particular interest to find whether differing responses across a range of age groups might exist 24 hours post-dosing. Blood pressure control was greater with Inderex than with either Inderal LA or bendrofluazide. No significant difference between different age groups on the three treatments was demonstrated. There was some evidence, not statistically significant, suggesting potassium values to be lower on bendrofluazide and on Inderex. Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) values were raised on bendrofluazide. Inderex is more effective in lowering blood pressure than either bendrofluazide or Inderal LA alone, and as a single capsule given once daily encourages compliance in comparison with combination treatments.", 
    "26": "To determine whether ischaemic tissue is more sensitive than normal tissue to class III anti-arrhythmic agents, we studied the effects of the class III agents clofilium, d-sotalol and bretylium on normal and ischaemic Purkinje fibres one day after ligation of canine left anterior descending coronary artery. In ischaemic Purkinje fibres superfused with normal Tyrode's solution (4mM K+, 2.7mM Ca+2) clofilium produced early afterdepolarisations at 10(-7)M and 10(-6)M, d-sotalol at 10(-5)M to 10(-3)M, and bretylium at 10(-3)M. The early afterdepolarisation response of ischaemic tissue, which in some cases prolonged action potential duration to beyond 10 s, was significantly different from the simple prolongation of action potential duration seen in normal Purkinje fibres at the same concentrations. Clofilium and d-sotalol differentially produced early afterdepolarisations at or very near \"anti-arrhythmic\" doses. Therefore, class III anti-arrhythmics produced early afterdepolarisations differentially in ischaemic tissue at concentrations which did not produce early afterdepolarisations in normal tissue.", 
    "27": "The use of more than one drug to control blood pressure may be necessary in up to 50% of hypertensive patients seen in clinical practice. A rational basis for combination therapy includes 1) the use of drugs that act on different physiological systems involved in blood-pressure control and 2) using a second drug to counteract reflex responses, which may limit the effectiveness of the first, and, 3) as is less commonly practiced, the use of low doses of two drugs that act on the same or different physiological systems to avoid the side effects encountered with higher doses of single agents. The hemodynamic effects of calcium-entry blocking drugs and beta-adrenoceptor blockers are complementary and synergism might be anticipated, particularly with the dihydropyridines and beta-blockers, since the latter prevent the short-term reflex increase in sympathetic activity occurring as a consequence of vasodilation. Although there are many studies advocating the benefits of such combinations, caution is required with combinations of beta-blockers and verapamil or diltiazem because of potential cardiac depressant effects resulting from the more complex effects of these calcium-channel blockers on cardiac myo-cytes and conducting tissue. Such problems would be more likely to be encountered in patients with long-standing hypertension and in whom poor left ventricular function and coro-nary artery disease may be present.", 
    "28": "The antianginal effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are achieved by a reduction in myocardial oxygen demand. This is a rational approach to treatment in patients whose angina is caused by a fixed stenosis. However, dynamic coronary vasospasm is an important factor in patients with chronic stable angina. Nifedipine increases myocardial oxygen supply by reducing coronary vascular tone and is a logical approach to treatment in these patients. For monotherapy of angina, nifedipine is less effective than the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, but the combination has additive effects in reducing the frequency of anginal episodes and improving exercise tolerance. Plasma concentrations of nifedipine are closely related to clinical efficacy, and the variable first-pass metabolism of the drug leads to wide interindividual differences in peak concentrations and duration of action. Increasing the size of individual doses of nifedipine carries a risk of enhanced side effects due to high peak plasma concentrations. Optimal treatment may be more appropriately achieved in some patients by a slow release formulation, but with an increased frequency of administration.", 
    "29": "From the pharmacologic point of view, each of the major types of antianginal agents--calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and nitrates--seem to act at least in part by an improvement of the myocardial blood supply. The recently elucidated mechanism of action of nitrates, acting on a common pathway with the endothelium-derived relaxation factor (EDRF), suggests an important role for guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP in maintaining coronary artery patency in patients with coronary atheroma. The efficacy of calcium antagonists, even in effort-induced angina, is in accord with a current hypothesis that physical exercise in the presence of coronary stenosis can cause relative coronary vasoconstriction, or at the least, failure of full dilation. Therefore, calcium antagonists all act, at least in part, on the \"supply\" side of the supply-demand equation. Beta-adrenergic blockers appear to have as their major mode of action a reduction of heart rate, which not only reduces the oxygen demand but, through an anti-ischemic effect, also appears to improve the endocardial blood supply (in relation to the heart rate). Thus beta-blockade indirectly enhances the supply side of the equation. The intriguing situation arises whereby all three major types of antianginal compounds may also act by a common mechanism of anginal relief, namely, improvement in the coronary blood supply, in addition to the diverse mechanisms specific to each type of compound. That conclusion does not mean the the \"demand\" side of the equation can be ignored. Rather, the critical importance of a reduced myocardial blood supply in the production of anginal syndromes is highlighted.", 
    "30": "Experiments were performed on isolated canine and human coronary arteries to study the alpha- and beta-adrenolytic properties of ridazolol. On canine coronary arteries precontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha 2 microM and pretreated with phentolamine 1 microM, ridazolol competitively antagonized the isoproterenol-induced relaxations, with a pA2 value of 8.5 (7.8-9.1). Thereafter the alpha-adrenolytic activity of ridazolol was assessed on these same canine coronary vessels. Ridazolol activity was compared with that of prazosin on dose-response curves to norepinephrine in the presence of cocaine (30 microM) and propranolol (3 microM). Schild plots for both drugs gave straight lines, with slopes not different from unity. The pA2 value was 7.1 (6.8-7.3) for ridazolol and 8.1 (7.9-8.4) for prazosin. In another set of experiments the alpha-adrenolytic activity of ridazolol was compared on canine and human coronary arteries. A submaximal contraction with norepinephrine (10 microM) was first assessed in the presence of propranolol 3 microM. The addition of ridazolol 3 microM significantly decreased the norepinephrine (10 microM)-induced contractions of both preparations. However, the inhibition was more pronounced on canine coronary arteries. In conclusion, ridazolol is a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist with moderate alpha-adrenolytic activity. The weaker inhibition of the norepinephrine-induced contraction observed in human preparations suggests the presence of a heterogeneous population of postjunctional alpha adrenoceptors.", 
    "31": "Calcium-channel antagonists and beta-adrenergic blocking agents have become important modalities in the cardiovascular therapeutic armamentarium. These drugs are often administered as monotherapy to a wide range of cardiological patients with angina pectoris, hypertension, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and other diseases. Since within each class these drugs exhibit pharmacologic differences, it follows that their effectiveness varies in different disease states and that they exhibit a wide variety of side effects. In an attempt to optimize therapy, the individual drugs from these two classes can be combined; and the efficaciousness and side-effect profile of various combinations between calcium-channel antagonists and beta blockers are discussed in this review. Recommendations as to which patients may benefit from a combination and as to which patients may be harmed by the combination therapy will be made. Very few studies have compared the safety and efficacy of a single agent with the combination and with placebo in a controlled randomized fashion. To determine which therapy is superior and to determine which combination one should recommend under what circumstances, such placebo-controlled, randomized trials are a necessity, and will hopefully be performed although the complexity is enormous.",

In the period of 3 months they were given twice daily a 0.5% solution of Vistagan-Liquifilm, a compound blocking as well the beta 1 as the beta 2 receptors. After 2 weeks 76.7 p.c. of the treated eyes showed a normalization of the intraocular pressure and 23.3 p.c. an improvement. After 3 months the IOP was normalized in 73.3 p.c.; an improvement showed 26.7 p.c. of the eyes. The compound was well tolerated and did not cause any complications from the side of the respiratory or circulatory system.", 
    "34": "A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model of hypersensitivity to adrenergic stimulation following abrupt withdrawal of chronic beta blockade was developed. The model employs the Hill equation, a term which describes the competition between isoproterenol and l-propranolol for beta receptors, and a kinetic term which characterizes the appearance and disappearance rates of up-regulated beta receptors. The model predicted peak chronotropic hyperresponsiveness to isoproterenol 48 hr following abrupt withdrawal of chronic treatment with daily propranolol doses of 160 mg, and a drug half-life of 3.5 hr. The model also predicted that increasing the dose rate and prolonging the half-life of propranolol delayed and decreased the extent of adrenergic hypersensitivity. The time-course of adrenergic hypersensitivity simulated by our model was in excellent agreement with that observed in studies which were published earlier by our laboratory. The model underestimated the extent of adrenergic hypersensitivity. The results of our simulation are consistent with a beta agonist-receptor-effector system, which involves spare receptors, amplification of response by second and third messengers, and beta agonist- antagonist-induced receptor regulation.", 
    "35": "The influence of exogenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone on the myoelectrical activity of stomach was investigated in skate and cod. The i.v. or intracerebral application of the peptide (5-8-10 micrograms/kg) led to an increase in the amplitude of the stomach cardiac and pyloric potentials, and to a change in their rate. The effect lasted longer following intracerebral administration of the peptide and was abolished by vagotomy. Irrespective of the technique of the administration, the peptide effect on the stomach myoelectrical activity was abolished by atropine and not affected by phentolamine or propranolol.", 
    "36": "The effects of beta-adrenoreceptors agonists and antagonists on vascular tone were studied. Activation of beta-adrenoreceptors led to vasomotor reaction irrespective of the endothelium, through a direct effect on the smooth muscle elements of the vascular wall. The dilating effect of propranolol is determined by its interaction with endothelial cells which leads to the PGI2 and, perhaps, EDRF release.", 
    "37": "In the human heart the beta-adrenergic pathways are the primary means of increasing cardiac performance in response to acute or chronic stress. Control of beta pathway function is achieved by changes in the receptors themselves, and to a lesser degree by adjustments in the inhibitory G protein (Gi). In heart failure myocardial beta-receptor function is substantially reduced, but the beta-receptor pathways are so powerful that they remain capable of supporting inotropic function. Certain therapeutic interventions that improve exercise performance in heart failure can partially restore beta-receptor pathway function to normal; these interventions include beta-blocker therapy and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Other types of therapy, such as chronic administration of beta-adrenergic agonists, may produce undesirable effects by increasing beta-receptor subsensitivity; however, the effects of beta-agonists on beta-receptor function are somewhat unpredictable and certain beta-agonists do not appear to produce much desensitization. Finally, the failing human heart is in effect partially denervated due to depletion of neuronal norepinephrine, and consequently in advanced heart failure beta-agonists that possess an indirect component of action will be less effective than exclusively direct-acting agents. These observations indicate that the baseline status and the intervention-associated behaviour of the human myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor systems need to be considered in developing therapeutic strategies in congestive heart failure.", 
    "38": "The stimulant effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline on contractile force and adenylate cyclase, mediated through beta 1 and beta 2-adrenoceptors, are analysed in isolated atrial and ventricular myocardium of man. The tissues were obtained from patients without advanced heart failure undergoing heart surgery. Usually, both adrenaline and noradrenaline stimulated adenylate cyclase predominantly through ventricular and atrial beta 2-adrenoceptors. Because the relative density of beta 2-adrenoceptors is usually smaller than that of beta 1-adrenoceptors, stimulation of one beta 2-adrenoceptor leads to the production of up to 10 times more cyclic AMP molecules than does stimulation of one beta 1-adrenoceptor. Adrenaline and noradrenaline maximally enhance contractile force through both atrial and ventricular beta 1-adrenoceptors. Adrenaline can also maximally enhance contractile force through atrial beta 2-adrenoceptors. In the ventricle, adrenaline increases force via beta 2-adrenoceptors by up to 60% of its maximal beta 1 response. Noradrenaline can increase atrial and ventricular contractile force through beta 2-adrenoceptors but only at high concentrations. Unexpectedly, in atria from patients treated with the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol, contractile responses to adrenaline are markedly and selectively augmented through activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors. In atria from atenolol-treated patients equi-inotropic concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline acting through beta 2 and beta 1-adrenoceptors, respectively, cause similar increases of cyclic AMP and of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity.", 
    "39": "It is well known that there are abnormalities of the sympathetic nervous system in chronic congestive heart failure. The aim of our study was to verify the effects on heart rate, blood pressure and some echocardiographic parameters of performance and inotropic state of iv infusion of dopamine at different dosages in 14 patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients were divided into 3 groups: the first one of patients on standard treatment, the second of subjects on standard treatment and beta blockers, the third of patients who stopped beta blocker therapy and remained on standard therapy. In the first group dopamine at low dosage did not significantly modify heart rate, blood pressure, performance and contractile state, while it did decrease end systolic wall stress. In the second group the same dosage significantly decreased blood pressure and stress, maintaining unchanged the other indexes; the same behaviour was presented by the third group. At high dosage dopamine in the first group significantly increased blood pressure, ejection fraction, contractility and stress. No modifications were observed in the second group, probably because of a pharmacological inhibition of beta receptors. The third group showed a significant increase in blood pressure, stress and inotropic state. From our data it appears that dopamine treatment in chronic congestive heart failure may reveal the presence of the so-called \"down regulation\" phenomenon.",

Electrophysiological study indicated that axonal conduction velocity is 7.3 +/- 0.5 m/s (ranging from 3.6 to 17.2 m/s). Possible functional roles of catecholamine-containing neurons of spinal cord include involvement in sympathetic control of cardiac cycle duration.",

Addition of the beta-adrenoblockers to the cell culture was demonstrated to enhance cellular total cholesterol levels and to stimulation their proliferation. Propranolol and pindolol given in a single dose was found to result in the appearance of atherogenic properties of the patients' sera.",

    "43": "To investigate the effect of age on the pulmonary uptake of propranolol, minced tissue (0.4 g) of lungs isolated from 3- to 104-week-old rats was incubated with the drug (1 to 500 micrograms mL-1) prepared in oxygenated, pH 7.4 Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution (20 mL) containing 3% BSA for 60 min at 37 degrees C. In any age-group the metabolism of propranolol was not significant (i.e. less than 0.6% of any initial load) under the present in-vitro conditions. The extent of uptake after the incubation with 2.5 micrograms mL-1 of the drug was largest in the 7 weeks (i.e. 82% of the initial load) and relatively small in the 3(64%), 24(61%), 52(51%) and 104(48%) week old rats. Similar, specific age-dependence was observed in the tissue-to-medium concentration ratio of the drug. In any age-group, the initial uptake rate obtained in the first 5 min of the incubation was found to be a combination of apparently linear transport and saturable (capacity-limited) processes. There was a marked, specific age-dependence in the capacity-limited uptake rate. Although Km' value was almost equivalent in any age-group (i.e. 24.4 to 25.4 micrograms mL-1), Vmax exhibited a specific age-dependence by yielding the highest value in 7 weeks (0.726 +/- 0.101 mg g-1 min-1) and relatively low values in 3 (0.501 +/- 0.082 mg g-1 min-1), 52 (0.410 +/- 0.088 mg-1 g-1 min-1) and 104 (0.397 +/- 0.074 mg g-1 min-1) weeks.", 
    "44": "In recent biochemical studies it was demonstrated that residue Asp113 of the beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) is an indispensable amino acid for the binding of beta-AR antagonists. Earlier fluorescence studies showed that a tryptophan-rich region of the beta-AR is involved in the binding of propranolol, the prototype beta-AR antagonist. Bearing these two biochemical findings in mind, we explored the beta-AR part containing Asp113, for an energetically favorable antagonist binding site. This was done by performing molecular docking studies with the antagonist propranolol and a specific beta-AR peptide which included, besides Asp113, two possibly relevant tryptophan residues. In the docking calculations, the propranolol molecule was allowed to vary all its internal torsional angles. The receptor peptide was kept in an alpha-helix conformation, while side chains relevant to ligand binding were flexible to enable optimal adaptations to the ligand's binding conformation. By means of force-field calculations the total energy was minimized, consisting of the intramolecular energies of both ligand and receptor peptide, and the intermolecular energy. We found an antagonist binding site, consisting of amino acids Asp113 and Trp109, which enabled energetically favorable interactions with the receptor-binding groups of propranolol. According to these results, binding involves three main interaction points: (i) a reinforced ionic bond; (ii) a hydrogen bond; and (iii) a hydrophobic/charge transfer interaction. The deduced binding site shows a difference in affinity between the levo- and dextrorotatory isomers of propranolol caused by a difference in ability to form a hydrogen bond, which is in conformity with the experimentally observed stereoselectivity. Moreover, it also provides an explanation for the beta 1-selectivity of p-phenyl substituted phenoxypropanolamines like betaxolol. The p-phenyl substituent of betaxolol was shown to be sterically hindered upon binding to the beta 2-AR peptide, whereas this hindrance is very likely to be much less with the beta 1-AR peptide. Finally, the proposed antagonist binding site is discussed in the light of some recent biochemical findings and theories.", 
    "45": "Microelectrode and mechanical studies were performed with isolated guinea pig myocardium (right ventricular free walls and papillary muscles) to examine the effects of platelet-activating factor (PAF) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Low concentrations of PAF (10(-8) to 10(-6) M, a range equivalent to the blood concentrations that produce marked hypotension in vivo) had no effects on action potential configuration and contractile force. High concentrations (10(-5) to 10(-4)M) of PAF and LPC per se elicited slow response action potentials with concomitant contraction (restored contraction) in the myocardium depolarized with elevated K+ (25 mM); they also augmented slow responses and restored contractions produced by a low concentration of isoproterenol (10(-8) M). Although these results suggested there was an increase in slow Ca current, the slow responses and restored contractions thus produced were greatly suppressed or abolished by the addition of a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, sotalol (10(-5) M), and by pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p., 24 h prior). In accordance with our previous conclusions, the present results suggest that direct cardiac action is not involved in the mechanisms of hypotension produced by PAF. It was also shown that high concentrations of PAF and LPC may act nonspecifically as amphiphilic compounds to induce transmitter release from sympathetic nerve endings, which may in turn augment the Ca current channels in the myocardial cell membrane.", 
    "46": "The catecholamines noradrenaline and dopamine have been proposed as neuromodulators of cortical neuron excitability, and such a regulation could be mediated by specific adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. We characterized electrophysiologically some of the types of responses to the iontophoretic application of adrenergic and dopaminergic agonists and antagonists on single cells in the rat visual cortex (areas occipital 1 monocular or Oc1M and occipital 1 binocular or Oc1B). For the majority of spontaneously active and visual cortical cells, noradrenaline and dopamine decreased the firing frequency. In the case of visually driven (synaptically activated) neurons, background firing was the main component of the response to be inhibited by the administration of noradrenaline, clonidine, and oxymetazoline, leading to an enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio. Since these effects could be reduced or blocked by a previous ejection of the specific alpha 2-antagonist idazoxan, the findings support a role for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the transmission of sensory inputs to the visual cortex. These effects were not found with the mixed alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine nor with the beta-agonist isoproterenol. Finally, the use of the inhibitory amino acid GABA rules out a simple hyperpolarizing response as the mechanism underlying noradrenaline modulatory effects in the cerebral cortex.",

To evaluate the haemodynamic properties of the new beta-blocker ridazolol alone and in combination with the vasodilator molsidomine a randomized study was carried out in 12 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA II/III). beta-Blockade leads to a decreasing tendency in blood pressure and heart rate. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PC) was not significantly altered and ejection fraction remained unchanged. Molsidomine showed a decrease of PC. The combination of both drugs revealed both the positive haemodynamic effects of molsidomine and the reduced heart rate of beta-blockade. Negative side effects could not be observed.", 
    "49": "The participation of beta 1-adrenoceptor on renin secretion was studied in perfused rat kidney. Administration of propranolol, inhibited the renin release mediated by isoproterenol. Likewise, metoprolol and practolol, showed a similar potency to propranolol in inhibiting isoproterenol-induced renin secretion. These results suggest that the for isoproterenol-induced renin release in rats is a beta 1-type adrenoceptor.", 
    "50": "In a previous study we discovered that the adenosine receptor antagonist, caffeine, increases plasma renin activity and blood pressure in renin-dependent renovascular hypertension. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether methylxanthines augment the increase in renin secretion induced by a reduction in renal perfusion pressure and, if so, whether this effect is mediated by a direct action on juxtaglomerular cells. Accordingly, we examined the effects of infusions of caffeine and theophylline directly into the renal artery on the increase in renin secretion induced by suprarenal aortic constriction. All studies were conducted in dogs receiving an intravenous infusion of propranolol to prevent changes in renin secretion mediated indirectly via the sympathetic nervous system. Caffeine (5 mg/min) increased the renin response to suprarenal aortic constriction about 10-fold without significantly affecting renal hemodynamics or excretory function. Theophylline (5 mg/kg), on the other hand, did not significantly increase the renin response to a reduction in renal perfusion pressure, but did increase urine flow and sodium excretion about 10-fold. However, in the non-filtering, beta-adrenoceptor blocked, canine kidney, theophylline markedly increased the renin response to suprarenal aortic constriction. These results indicate that methylxanthines can potentiate the renin response to a reduction in renal perfusion pressure most likely by directly affecting the juxtaglomerular cells; however, since increased sodium delivery to the macula densa inhibits renin release, the extent to which methylxanthines affect the renin response to renal artery hypotension depends on how vigorous the diuretic response is to a given methylxanthine.", 
    "51": "The chronotropic cardiac effects of alinidine were studied in the conscious dog with chronic atrioventricular block. Alinidine at 0.5 - 4 mg/kg, i.e., at plasma concentrations between 42 +/- 2 and 1625 +/- 371 ng/ml, initially increased atrial rate dose-dependently. This effect fell off rapidly, but atrial bradycardia was never observed. After atropine and pindolol, which raised basal atrial rate, alinidine (2 mg/kg) decreased atrial rate, whereas after phenoxy-benzamine, yohimbine or phentolamine, it produced atrial effects identical to those observed under basal conditions, i.e., initial tachycardia and no bradycardia. Alinidine dose-relatedly decreased ventricular rate. None of the pretreatments modified the maximal ventricular bradycardia, but interestingly after pindolol or yohimbine this effect developed more rapidly (maximal bradycardia between 3 and 5 against 30 min) and then declined progressively. Alinidine did not modify mean blood pressure at any dose. After atropine, phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine, alinidine remained without effect on mean blood pressure, but after pindolol or yohimbine, a hypotensive effect appeared concomitantly with the reduction of the ventricular bradycardia. These results show that the initial atrial cardioacceleration due to alinidine results from a direct vagolytic action of this drug and that the absence of atrial bradycardia results from buffering by the vagolytic effect and/or a relatively low basal atrial rate. They also suggest that the ventricular bradycardia does not involve either the muscarinic cholinoceptors or the alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors, though the results obtained after pindolol or yohimbine suggest possible involvement of a fall in sympathetic tone by stimulation of presynaptic or central alpha2-adrenoceptors, particularly in the persistence of the bradycardic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The preference by bunitrolol for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors of the rat brain, heart and/or lung was assessed by the radioligand binding assay method with 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-ICYP) or 3H-CGP12177. Scatchard plots of 125I-ICYP binding in the presence of bunitrolol were found to be non-linear. The inhibition constants (Ki) of bunitrolol for high (beta 2-) and low affinity sites (beta 1-) were: 0.42 +/- 0.16 nM for beta 1 and 3.55 +/- 1.61 nM for beta 2 (beta 1 greater than beta 2), respectively. Displacement experiments conducted with the preparations of the rat brain using 125I-ICYP or with the preparations of the rat heart using 3H-CGP12177 yielded Ki values for bunitrolol of 0.53 +/- 0.20 (beta 1) and 2.37 +/- 0.78 (beta 2) nM for 125I-ICYP binding and 2.01 +/- 0.38 (beta 1) and 12.67 +/- 6.54 (beta 2) nM for 3H-CGP12177 binding. In addition, the Ki value for 5HT1B-receptors assessed in displacement experiments conducted with 125I-ICYP in the presence of 30 microM I-metoprolol in the rat brain was 10.54 +/- 5.92 nM.

In organ bath experiments, non-selective and beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor selective agonists produced concentration-dependent inotropic responses in human right atrial appendage. Both subtypes mediate inotropic responses. In guinea-pig right atria chronotropic responses were mediated predominantly through beta 1-adrenoceptors. 3. Receptor binding studies using (-)[125I]-cyanopindolol (CYP) and beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonists showed that beta 2-adrenoceptors comprised 25% of the total population of beta-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig right atria. In human right atria the proportion is higher (40%). 4. Quantitative autoradiography was used to determine the location and densities of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in guinea-pig heart. Both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were distributed on myocardium. The atrioventricular conducting system had a higher density of beta 2-adrenoceptors compared with myocardium.",

Vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol were further enhanced by TL99 (10 nmol/L). 4. The enhancement of vasoconstrictor responses by alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists is not due to the removal of a counteracting vasodilator component produced by activation of beta-adrenoceptors.",

At high concentrations of the substance a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect and prolongation of the functional refractory period of the preparations were recorded. These effects were comparable to those of propranolol and metipranolol. Furthermore, a mild increase in the rate of the reserpinized atria after application of 10(-7) mol.l-1 BL 343 Ac suggests a possible intrinsic sympathetic activity of the substance. BL 343 Ac has an antiisoprenaline effect with a pA2 value comparable to that of propranolol and metipranolol. However the slope of the Schild plot was different from 1, indicating that the substance possesses also other than competitively beta-adrenolytic properties.", 
    "56": "The electrophysiologic effects of intravenous (0.15 mg kg-1) and oral (20 mg day-1) betaxolol have been investigated in 11 patients with atrioventricular (A-V) nodal reentrant tachycardia and eight patients with orthodromic A-V reentrant tachycardia. Betaxolol significantly (P greater than 0.01) prolonged sinus cycle length, sinus node recovery time, intranodal conduction time, and the antegrade functional refractory period of the A-V node. When the effective refractory period of the A-V node could be determined it was increased by betaxolol, whereas no significant electrophysiologic effects were observed in the atrium, the ventricle or the accessory pathway. Intravenous betaxolol prevented tachycardia in 8 out of 11 patients with A-V nodal reentrant tachycardia, whereas oral betaxolol was effective in 10 patients, primarily by acting on the antegrade limb in two patients and on the retrograde limb in eight patients. In those with A-V reentrant tachycardia, intravenous betaxolol did not prevent tachycardia in any patient, while it was effective after oral treatment in two patients. When the tachycardia remained inducible, cycle length of the tachycardia increased in all patients, due to prolongation of the antegrade and retrograde conduction time in patients with A-V nodal reentrant tachycardia, and due to an increase in the antegrade conduction time, i.e. the A-V node, in the patients with A-V reentrant tachycardia. In conclusion, betaxolol proved to be effective in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia; for chronic treatment, a single oral dose (20 mg) seems to suffice.", 
    "57": "The enhancement of cardiac inotropism induced by electrical stimulation of acutely decentralized efferent preganglionic sympathetic axons was reduced, but still present, following intravenous hexamethonium administration (10 mg/kg). This residual enhancement was eliminated following subsequent administration of timolol (0.1 mg in 0.1 mL normal saline) into the ipsilateral stellate and middle cervical ganglia. Similar results were obtained when the order of administration of these agents was reversed. When the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (1, 2 or 5 micrograms in 1 microL of normal saline) was administered into specific loci of an acutely decentralized stellate or middle cervical ganglion, cardiac chronotropism and/or inotropism were increased; when similar injections were made into adjacent ganglionic sites cardiac responses usually were not elicited. Following hexamethonium administration similar results were obtained indicating that these effects were not primarily dependent upon nicotinic cholinergic synapses. In contrast, repeat injections of isoproterenol into the site that initiated cardiac responses when injected with isoproterenol failed to elicit any cardiac responses following local administration of timolol into the same site indicating that the effects of isoproterenol could be blocked by a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent. Injections of 1 to 5 micrograms of isoproterenol into a ganglion which was surgically disconnected from the heart failed to elicit cardiac responses, demonstrating that at these doses detectable activation of cardiac myocyte beta-adrenergic receptors via circulating isoproterenol which had leaked out of the ganglion did not occur. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic receptors in intrathoracic ganglia are involved in the efferent sympathetic regulation of the heart and that such receptors are associated with neurons in specific ganglionic loci.", 
    "58": "1. The effects of phentolamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent and amousulalol, an alpha 1 and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist on hypoxia-induced impairment in cardiac function and metabolism were examined using the isolated heart Langendorff preparation of the rabbit. 2. Hypoxia induced cessation of cardiac contractile force, a rise in resting tension, a decrease in myocardial high-energy phosphates, an increase in tissue calcium content and the release of ATP metabolites from the heart. Subsequent reoxygenation resulted in little recovery of cardiac contractile force, and there were further increases in tissue calcium content and in the release of creatine kinase from the heart. 3. Treatment of hypoxic hearts with either 83 microM phentolamine or 45 microM amosulalol resulted in a suppression of the rise in resting tension, the tissue calcium accumulation and the release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites during hypoxia. This treatment also elicited significant recovery of cardiac contractile force, restoration of myocardial high-energy phosphates, suppression of the release of creatine kinase and the accumulation of tissue calcium during reoxygenation. Both 83 microM phentolamine and 45 microM amosulalol a significant prolongation of the effective refractory period of rabbit isolated atria. 4. Lower concentrations of phentolamine (16 microM) and amosulalol) (9 microM), which are sufficient to exert an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action, did not elicit an appreciable effect on the post-hypoxic recovery of cardiac contractile force. 5. These results suggest that phentolamine and amosulalol are capable of protecting the myocardium from hypoxia-induced derangements in cardiac function and metabolism. This effect is probably attributable to their membrane stabilizing effect, rather than to their alpha-adrenoceptor blocking action.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics and the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity according to time of conventional (C) and long acting (LA) propranolol in cirrhotic patients. Twenty-four patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and oesophageal varices were randomly assigned to receive either 160 mg C propranolol, 160 mg LA propranolol or placebo acutely and then following repeated administration (acute and chronic phases). Thereafter propranolol concentrations and beta-adrenoceptor blockade (resting and exercise heart rates) were measured at different intervals. 2. The Cmax was significantly higher with C propranolol in both phases. The time of Cmax was significantly later with LA propranolol in both phases. The AUCs were significantly higher after chronic administration with both formulations of propranolol. 3. The exercise peaks of beta-adrenoceptor blockade were similar between the two formulations and between the two phases of administration of propranolol. The duration of effective beta-adrenoceptor blockade was significantly longer in the chronic phase and seemed to be longer with LA than with C propranolol although this was not significant (72 +/- 31 vs 48 +/- 18 h, respectively). 4. There was a significant correlation between the log propranolol concentration and exercise heart rate but not with resting heart rate. No correlation could be demonstrated between pharmacological data and the Child Pugh score. 5. We conclude that in cirrhotic patients exercise testing was a reliable method in the assessment of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Pharmacology of propranolol was found to be different according to the formulation or to the phase of administration.", 
    "60": "With the increasingly widespread recognition of the adverse side effects of traditional antihypertensive medications, alternative approaches to the treatment of uncomplicated hypertensive patients have been proposed. The use of vasodilator agents, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers results in blood pressure reduction without adverse metabolic consequences. Furthermore, vasodilatory agents reverse the principal physiological abnormality of hypertensive patients, that is, they reverse the increased systemic vascular resistance that characterizes these patients and, in so doing, may alleviate abnormalities of systolic and diastolic left ventricular performance. In particular, a comparison of the effects of nifedipine and propranolol on left ventricular (LV) function in patients with moderately severe hypertension revealed significant differences in their effects on cardiac function. Although both drugs reduced blood pressure to an identical degree, nifedipine therapy was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac output, and improved parameters of left ventricular contractile and diastolic function as measured by quantitative radionuclide ventriculography. Vasodilator therapy should be considered for the initial treatment of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension.", 
    "61": "Dementia-related behavioral symptoms present a difficult management problem for caregivers and health care providers. The first step in the treatment of behavioral symptoms in the elderly should involve nonpharmacologic measures. This should include the exclusion of medication-induced dementia and delirium, which is an important consideration in the elderly owing to multiple medication use and alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Other measures involve relatively simple environmental changes. If these are unsuccessful, pharmacologic management is often tried. Numerous concerns surround the use of antipsychotics, which are the primary agents used to treat behavioral symptoms in demented elderly. The public is concerned about their inappropriate use as chemical restraints. Another concern involves the efficacy of these agents. Most well-designed studies demonstrate an overall modest effect from the antipsychotics that is often similar to that seen with placebo. There may be a small number of patients who respond markedly, whereas the majority do not receive great benefit. Unfortunately, all are exposed to the numerous side effects of these agents, including some irreversible movement disorders. If these agents are believed to be necessary, efforts should be made to use them in a manner that reduces the associated risks. A few other agents have been noted to successfully treat the problem behaviors associated with dementia, but most have been in the form of case reports. It appears that the optimal treatment of these problems relies on future research in the area of nonantipsychotic modalities that will be efficacious and have a rather benign side effect profile.", 
    "62": "In dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, the anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was partially occluded to reduce LAD flow to about half of the original flow (partial occlusion). Myocardial pH (MpH) was measured by the use of a micro glass pH electrode. MpH decreased from 7.5-7.63 to 6.82-6.86 30 min after partial occlusion of the LAD. Nipradilol (0.3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 30 min after partial occlusion, which continued for a further 60 min after nipradilol injection. Nipradilol decreased blood pressure and heart rate, and significantly increased myocardial pH which had been decreased by partial occlusion, within 60 min after injection. Nipradilol-induced restoration of the myocardial [H+] (calculated from the pH data), that had been increased by partial occlusion, was 48.5%. Bradycardia induced by nipradilol was not a determinant factor in the pH effect of nipradilol, because even in the paced heart, nipradilol restored the myocardial [H+] that had been increased by partial occlusion. These results indicate that nipradilol attenuates ischemia-induced myocardial acidosis, suggesting the favorable effect of nipradilol on ischemic myocardium. The favorable effect of nipradilol may be due to the beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic effect rather than the vasodilating effect.", 
    "63": "1. The effects of the irreversible beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist bromoacetylalprenololmenthane (BAAM) were studied in isolated cardiac and uterine preparations from guinea-pigs and rats and in guinea-pig ileal preparations. 2. In the presence of BAAM (0.1-10 microM) concentration-effect curves to (-)-isoprenaline were shifted to the right in a concentration-dependent manner in all cardiac and uterine tissues. Maximum responses to (-)-isoprenaline were unaffected by BAAM except in guinea-pig left atrial and in some guinea-pig uterine preparations; however, the reductions in the maximum responses were not concentration-dependent. The mean pKB values for BAAM in guinea-pig left atria, right atria, rat whole atria and rat uterus were 7.26, 7.24, 6.84 and 7.90 respectively. 3. In guinea-pig ileal preparations, BAAM (0.1-30 microM) relaxed contractions induced by K+, histamine and acetylcholine in a non-beta-adrenoreceptor-related manner since relaxant responses were unaffected by propranolol (0.5 microM). In other tissues higher concentrations of BAAM (30-100 microM) elicited atrial standstill and depressed K+-induced contractions in uterine smooth muscle. 4. Treatment of tissues with BAAM (10-100 microM) followed by extensive wash-out increased the EC50 values for (-)-isoprenaline 21- to 83-fold. The maximum response to the catecholamine was unaffected by BAAM except in guinea-pig left atrial preparations following treatment with 100 microM BAAM. At these concentrations BAAM markedly increased the effective refractory period. 5. Concentration-effect curves for the partial agonist, oxymethylene-isoprenaline (OM-ISO) were shifted to the right 12- to 355-fold after pretreatment of tissues with BAAM (10-30 microM) followed by wash-out. The maximum response to OM-ISO was unaltered in guinea-pig and rat uteri and was reduced to a similar degree as observed with (-)-isoprenaline in guinea-pig left atria. 6. In general, the non-selective beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist BAAM depressed maximum responses to beta-adrenoreceptor agonists only in cardiac preparations and at concentrations which elicited depressant activity. On the basis of the present study, BAAM does not appear to be a suitable irreversible beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist for use in organ bath experiments.", 
    "64": "Nonlinear regression analysis of agonist competition binding curves reveals that the [3H]-dihydroalprenolol-labeled receptor population with low affinity for isoproterenol is increased by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and this increase is abolished by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in vivo. Desipramine (DMI) decreased the beta adrenoceptor population with high agonist affinity to the same degree in PCPA-treated animals as in control animals, thus explaining the reported discrepancy between beta adrenoceptor number and responsiveness of the beta adrenoceptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system. Mianserin also selectively reduced the beta adrenoceptor population with high agonist affinity in membrane preparations of normal animals, whereas fluoxetine selectively abolished the upregulation of the low affinity sites in reserpinized animals and had no effect on either receptor population from brain of normal animals. The results emphasize the importance of nonlinear regression analysis of agonist competition binding for the interpretation of drug action and encourage the pursuit of the molecular neurobiology of the serotonin (5-HT)/norepinephrine (NE) link in brain.", 
    "65": "To determine if oxygen-derived free radicals are mediators of endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), the mechanism of contraction to xanthine plus xanthine oxidase was studied. Rings, with and without endothelium, of thoracic aorta from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Oxygen-derived free radicals caused concentration-dependent contractions; these contractions were twice as large in the aortas of SHR than in WKY rats. Deferoxamine reversed the response to xanthine oxidase to a small relaxation. Either allopurinol, superoxide dismutase, or catalase, or the combination of superoxide dismutase plus catalase reduced the contractions. Diltiazem inhibited the response to xanthine oxidase; in contrast, phentolamine plus propranolol did not affect it. Indomethacin and meclofenamate, but not tranylcypromine or dazoxiben blocked the contractions. Endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine in aortas from the SHR were not affected by deferoxamine or superoxide dismutase plus catalase. These data suggest that hydroxyl radicals cause contractions in the rat aorta, which are dependent on extracellular calcium and mediated by activation of the cyclooxygenase in the vascular smooth muscle. The augmented contractions in the hypertensive strain are due to an increased reactivity of the smooth muscle to oxygen-derived free radicals. However, the lack of effect of the scavengers on endothelium-dependent contractions to acetylcholine suggests that the endothelium-derived contracting factor is chemically different from oxygen-derived free radicals.", 
    "66": "Preeclampsia is a common disease and as such is a significant contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite the ubiquity of the disease and its public health impact, no comprehensive mechanism has been established. Therapy has been limited to bed rest and premature delivery.

    "67": "We assessed the utility of short-term (30 s) maximal isokinetic cycle ergometry as an additional method of investigating the limitations to exercise in 33 carefully selected patients with documented coronary artery disease. The technique proved safe and reproducible in these patients. In relation to normal standards, performance was better in the maximal isokinetic cycle ergometer test (peak power = 819 +/- 116 W; average power = 532 +/- 72 W; total work = 13.1 +/- 2.1 kJ; 95-101% of predicted) than in the progressive incremental exercise test (VO2 = 1.80 +/- 0.37 l.min-1; power output = 919 +/- 165 kpm.min-1; 70-80% of predicted). Beta blockade did not affect maximal performance during either isokinetic or progressive incremental cycling, although maximal heart rate was significantly lower during both tests in patients on beta blockade. Power output in the progressive exercise was not as strongly related to the indices measured during the 30 s isokinetic test (r = 0.59-0.63) as it was in previous studies of healthy individuals (r = 0.89). The ability to detect individual variations in short-term exercise capacity measured with maximal isokinetic cycle ergometry may have significant potential value 1) as an additional method of determining the limitations to exercise and 2) when executing an exercise prescription in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "68": "Alterations in plasma lipids consequent to endurance training and beta-blockade. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 21, No. 3, pp. 288-292, 1989. The chronic use of beta adrenergic blockers (BAB) has been associated with reductions in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and increases in triglycerides (TG). This study evaluated the impact of concurrent endurance exercise training and chronic medication with BAB on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles in healthy young adult males. Changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins were investigated while exercise training under the influence of one of two nonselective BAB [sotalol (320 mg.d-1) and propranolol (160 mg.d-1)], one beta 1 selective BAB [atenolol (100 mg.d-1)], or a placebo control. Total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), TG, and the ratios of TC/HDL and LDL/HDL were determined before and after endurance training programs of either 14 (N = 27, sotalol) or 15 (N = 47, propranolol/atenolol) wk duration. The subjects exhibited increases in maximal oxygen uptake of 12-20%. Despite increased endurance capacity, the subjects in both BAB and placebo control groups failed to demonstrate the expected increase in HDL-C and decrease in TG. In fact, HDL-C was significantly decreased post-training in the propranolol group. The placebo groups did decrease TC, LDL-C and the TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios, improving their CHD risk profile. Similar changes were not observed in the groups on BAB. Thus, with respect to the present population, BAB does appear to interfere with the usual training-induced improvements in the lipid profile. Endurance training may, however, reduce the deterioration in the lipid profile known to occur with BAB.", 
    "69": "The localization and number of beta adrenergic receptors were directly compared in the brains of rats and guinea pigs. The time course of association and saturability of [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP) binding to slide-mounted tissue sections was similar in rats (Kd = 17 pM) and guinea pigs (Kd = 20 pM). The beta-1 and beta-2 receptor subtypes were examined through the use of highly selective unlabeled receptor antagonists, ICI 118,551 (50 nM) and ICI 89,406 (70 nM). Dramatic species differences between rats and guinea pigs were observed in the neuroanatomical regional localization of the beta adrenergic receptor subtypes. For example, in the thalamus prominent beta-1 and beta-2 receptor populations were identified in the rat; however, the entire thalamus of the guinea pig had few, if any, beta adrenergic receptors of either subtype. Hippocampal area CA1 had high levels of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in both rats and guinea pigs but was accompanied by a widespread distribution of beta-2 adrenergic receptors only in rats. Quantitative autoradiographic analyses of 25 selected neuroanatomical regions 1) confirmed the qualitative differences in CNS beta adrenergic receptor localization, 2) determined that guinea pigs had significantly lower levels of beta adrenergic receptors than rats and 3) indicated a differential pattern of receptor subtypes between the two species. Knowledge of species differences in receptor patterns may be useful in designing effective experiments as well as in exploring the relationships between receptor and innervation patterns. Collectively, these data suggest caution be used in extrapolation of the relationships of neurotransmitters and receptors from studies of a single species.", 
    "70": "We examined the effects of dopamine and of a selective DA1 agonist, fenoldopam, on the levels of cyclic AMP in the trabecular meshwork, freshly excised from porcine and canine eyes. As measured by radioimmunoassay, fenoldopam at a concentration of 10(-5) M caused a 4-fold increase in the cyclic AMP content, from a basal level of 24.4 +/- 1.9 to 101.8 +/- 6.3 pmol/mg protein, of the trabecular meshwork samples from porcine eyes. In tissue samples from canine eyes, fenoldopam at a concentration of 10(-4) M increased the endogenous cyclic AMP level from a basal value of 26.0 +/- 4.6 to 64.2 +/- 5.7 pmol/mg protein. Dopamine, although less potent, produced a similar response. Preincubation with a DA1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, inhibited the increase in cyclic AMP levels by 90%. Such inhibition did not occur with the alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists phenoxybenzamine and propranolol, respectively. This investigation demonstrates that adenylate cyclase-coupled DA1 receptors are present in porcine and canine trabecular meshwork tissue.", 
    "71": "The metabolic effects of celiprolol, a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and alpha 2-blocking properties, were evaluated in a series of patients with hypertension, both with and without hyperlipidemia. Propranolol was tested as the reference drug in a randomized double-blind trial. Of the 35 patients of both sexes who completed the study, 17 were hyperlipidemic (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than or equal to 170 mg/dl) and 18 were normolipidemic. Both drugs exerted a similar hypotensive effect after gradual dose adjustment; however, propranolol reduced heart rate to a higher extent (-20.5%) than celiprolol (-7.7%). Propranolol determined a significant rise of total and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) associated triglyceridemia, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) levels and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios were significantly depressed, particularly in hyperlipidemic patients. Celiprolol, in contrast, slightly decreased triglyceridemia (significantly in the hyperlipidemic group at week 12) and caused a 5% increase of the HDL cholesterol levels. The total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was reduced by celiprolol at week 16 in both hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic patients. The effects of the two beta-adrenoceptor blockers on HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels differed significantly after 12 and 16 weeks of treatment, which confirm the divergent metabolic effects of the two agents.", 
    "72": "The fourth report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure varies from the Committee's earlier reports in a number of ways. The introduction of additional effective antihypertensive agents with varying pharmacologic properties has undoubtedly stimulated the Joint National Committee to recommend a more flexible individualized approach to treatment. Diuretics, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers are all recommended as reasonable first-step agents in treatment of hypertension. The pharmacologic properties, cost, and side-effect profiles of these drugs differ considerably, and the effectiveness of certain agents appears to vary according to the patient's age and race. All these factors should be considered, as should the existence of any concomitant disease, in choosing initial treatment. Whatever drug is chosen, the physician must continue to provide careful follow-up to ensure that adequate blood pressure control is achieved with minimal side effects.", 
    "73": "A total of 1666 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass were studied for the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Possible associations of this arrhythmia with various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors were studied by univariate (chi 2 and t tests) and multivariate (logistic regression) analyses. The overall incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 28.4%, with the major occurrence 2 days after the operation. Both univariate and multivariate studies indicated the patient's age to be the dominant factor promoting postoperative atrial fibrillation, with an increasing prevalence in older patients (p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative beta-blocker therapy conveyed considerable protection against postoperative atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001) but was less effective in the older patients. Men were more prone to this arrhythmia (p = 0.02). Although these associations appeared significant, the logistic model proved to be a poor predictor of postoperative atrial fibrillation, which suggests that other factors not studied, or mere chance, may also be responsible.", 
    "74": "The viscerovisceral reflex control of gastric tone remains poorly characterized. We have previously demonstrated physiological variations in gastric tone that occur during fasting and after feeding. These variations are neurally regulated. We have now compared the reflex mechanisms modulating gastric tone that are elicited by esophageal or duodenal distension in fasted, conscious dogs. To determine the pathways involved in these reflexes, we combined the technique of vagal blockade (by cooling the supradiaphragmatic vagi isolated within a surgically implanted cooling jacket) with the administration of autonomic drugs. Gastric tone was measured as the air volume within an intragastric bag maintained at a constant, low pressure by an electronic barostat. Standardized distensions were performed by means of an inflatable balloon-catheter positioned either in the mid-esophagus (in three dogs) or in the distal duodenum (in three dogs). A profound and consistent gastric relaxation was induced by distension of either the esophagus (247 +/- 21 ml delta volume, P less than 0.05) or the duodenum (238 +/- 29 ml, P less than 0.05). Supradiaphragmatic vagal cooling abolished the gastric relaxatory response to duodenal distension and significantly reduced, but did not completely suppress, the response to esophageal distension. Neither cholinergic stimulation (intravenous bethanechol) nor adrenergic blockade (combined intravenous phentolamine and propranolol) had any significant effect on either gastric relaxatory response. Combined adrenergic and cholinergic (intravenous atropine) blockade induced gastric relaxation, but failed to suppress the gastric responses. We conclude that both esophageal and duodenal distension elicit gastric relaxation by a noncholinergic vagal mechanism.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "The density of beta-adrenergic receptors is reduced in crude membranes prepared from failing human myocardium. We used quantitative autoradiography of radioligand binding sites in intact tissue slices to determine whether the total tissue content of receptors is reduced and to characterize the transmural distribution of receptors in cardiac myocytes and the coronary vasculature in hearts obtained from nine cardiac transplant patients with severe congestive failure. Binding of [125Iodo]cyanopindolol to transmural slices of human myocardium was rapid, saturable, stereoselective, and displaceable by agonists and antagonists with an appropriate rank order of potency. Binding isotherms in four normal and nine failing ventricles showed a significant reduction in the total tissue content of beta-receptors in failing myocardium (38.3 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg protein) compared with normal tissue (52.4 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein, p = 0.038). In the normal ventricles, the greatest receptor density was observed autoradiographically in myocytic regions of the subendocardium. Receptor density of the coronary arterioles was approximately 70% of that in adjacent myocytic regions. The density of binding sites in both myocytic regions and arterioles was diminished in all regions of the failing ventricles, but down-regulation was due primarily to a selective reduction of beta-receptors of subendocardial myocytes (63 +/- 5% of subepicardial receptor density vs. 115 +/- 6% in controls, p less than 0.0001). These observations indicate that down-regulation occurs nonuniformly in the transmural distribution and thus is likely not related simply to elevated circulating catecholamine levels.", 
    "76": "A transesophageal, ultrasonic cardiac imaging probe was built that incorporated a mechanism for changing the angle of the imaging plane of a conventional phased array in a precise and known manner. This probe was used to acquire an angular spatial sequence of two-dimensional images of the left ventricular cavity over a series of cardiac cycles by sweeping the imaging plane through it stepwise. The endocardial borders of these images were manually outlined off-line and the application of a three-dimensional reconstruction algorithm was then used to compute the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction. A study was conducted with seven anesthesized dogs to compare ultrasonic determinations by this method with determinations and measurements made using radionuclide and thermal dilution methods. Comparison of 33 ejection fractions, measured by the ultrasonic volume method and by the gated blood pool radionuclide approach, yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.87 and a standard error of the estimate of 5.7% measured over a range of 10% to 58% (average, 40%). Comparison of the ultrasonically measured volumes with those calculated from stroke volume (derived from thermal dilution cardiac output measurement) and ejection fraction (measured by radionuclide technique) produced a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and a standard error of the estimate of 10.3 mL over a range of 18 to 130 mL (average, 56 mL). The accuracy of volume and ejection fraction measurements with this new ultrasonic method seems comparable to that of other currently used clinical approaches such as radionuclide and angiography.", 
    "77": "In anesthetized cats, the muscles of hindlimb if contracting in steady-state regimen (one brief tetanic contraction every 5 sec) under direct stimulation with trains of electrical pulses increase their contraction force following a sudden decrease of arterial blood pressure (down to 60 mm Hg) or asphyxia. This reflex reaction reaches its maximum (the increase in the force by 38.2 +/- 6.6%) if the muscle contracts with 25% of the maximal force. The sympathetic nerve influence is transduced through beta adrenoreceptors.", 
    "78": "Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor density and subtype distribution has been determined in different kinds of heart failure. A decrease in cardiac beta-adrenoceptor function appears to be a general phenomenon in all kinds of heart failure. However, cardiac beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors seem to be differentially affected in different kinds of heart failure: while in end-stage idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy the diminished cardiac beta-adrenoceptor function is due to a selective loss in beta 1-adrenoceptors, in mitral valve disease, tetralogy of Fallot and end-stage ischaemic cardiomyopathy it is characterized by a concomitant reduction in beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Chronic treatment of heart failure patients with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists leads to an up-regulation of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors, but in a subtype-selective fashion: beta 1-selective antagonists increase only cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors, whereas non-selective antagonists increase both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Such a (subtype-selective) 'recovery' of cardiac beta-adrenoceptors may be one reason for the beneficial effects of low-dose beta-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment in patients with severe heart failure.", 
    "79": "Epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) alone did not increase free intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in human platelets loaded with Quin-2 or Fura-2; however, they did potentiate the effects of vasopressin (VP), serotonin (S) and platelet activating factor (PAF). The synergism in [Ca2+]i increase was also obtained in the presence of VP together with PAF, S with PAF as well as VP with S. The effect of E or NE was blocked by yohimbine and phentolamine. Prazosin was less effective, while propranolol had no effect at all. Clonidine did not potentiate the effects of VP, S or PAF on [Ca2+]i; however, it did block the potentiation induced by E or NE. E potentiated the VP-induced 45Ca2+ uptake as well as VP-stimulated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation. E alone did not change significantly the level of IP3 in platelets, nor did it influence the cyclic AMP level. The experimental results suggest that both Ca2+ influx and polyphosphoinositide breakdown underlie the mechanism of potentiation.", 
    "80": "In an open, crossover study, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of lisinopril and enalapril, administered alone and in combination with propranolol, were evaluated in 12 volunteers. The maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of lisinopril and time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) were 64 +/- 16 ng/ml and 7.5 +/- 1.5 h, respectively. The area under the serum curve (AUC) was 916 +/- 239 h. ng/ml. The Cmax of enalaprilat (89 +/- 34 ng/ml) was greater than that of lisinopril whilst Tmax was shorter (4.3 +/- 1.7 h) and AUC smaller (718 +/- 17 h.ng/ml) (P less than 0.01). Renal clearance of drug 48 h post-dosing showed that enalaprilat (164 +/- 38 ml/min) was cleared from plasma significantly more rapidly than lisinopril (82 +/- 16 ml/min) (P less than 0.001). Mean supine blood pressure decreased significantly with all treatments, as did heart rate. No significant changes were observed in either the serum concentrations or the urinary outputs of these ACE inhibitors following combination with propranolol, apart from a greater variability of Cmax after addition of propranolol to enalapril compared with lisinopril in combination.", 
    "81": "Radioreceptor assays with (-) [125I]-iodopindolol (IPIN) were used to describe circadian variations of beta-adrenoceptors in the pineal gland of male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Single-point experiments (200 pM IPIN, 8-9 pineals pooled per time point) showed a significant circadian variation (p less than 0.01) with maximal values (28.9 +/- 1.8 fmol/mg protein, means +/- SEM, n = 7) between 07:00 and 02:30 h, and minimal values at 04:00 (7.2 +/- 2.9 fmol/mg protein, n = 3), 8 h after darkness onset. Either exposure of animals to light at night or treating dark exposed hamsters with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol, prevented the nocturnal drop in the number of beta-adrenoceptors. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms at 02:30, 04:00 and 08:00 h (30-600 pM IPIN, one saturation experiment with 25 pineals pooled per time point) confirmed the circadian variation.",

In these cats, the urinary bladder was cannulated and intravesical pressure was also recorded. 2.

ATP and APPCP produced a transient rise in intravesical pressure at doses 2 to 50 times the dose needed for inhibition, presumably through ATP (P2) receptors. APPCP was 10 to 20 times more potent in exciting the bladder than ATP. 6. Theophylline and caffeine effectively antagonized purinergic effects mediated through adenosine (P1) receptors on both pelvic ganglia and bladder smooth muscle. 7. ATP inhibition of TMA-evoked bladder contractions and postganglionic nerve firing suggests that purinergic inhibition occurs, at least in part, at a postsynaptic site in the ganglia.", 
    "83": "Evidence from microinjection studies in anesthetized rats suggests that central excitatory amino acid pathways using N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system. To test the hypothesis that these pathways are tonically involved in the maintenance of or the baroreceptor reflex regulation of cardiovascular function, we have examined the effects of intravenous injection of the centrally acting, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801), on the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and behavior of conscious, freely moving sham-operated and sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats. Administration of MK-801 produced, within 5 minutes, dose-dependent elevations in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity that were sustained for 0.5 to 2.5 hours. For an equivalent dose, MK-801 produced approximately twice the peak changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate in the sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats than in the sham-operated rats. Pretreatment results were as follows: 1) The ganglion blocker chlorisondamine markedly attenuated the hypertension and tachycardia in the sham-operated and sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats, 2) pretreatment with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin virtually abolished the hypertension, and 3) the beta 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol markedly reduced the tachycardia. MK-801 also produced stereotypic behaviors and ataxia in the sham-operated and sinoaortic baroreceptor-denervated rats; however, qualitatively and quantitatively similar changes in behavior were induced in the latter by doses approximately five time lower than required in sham operated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Incubation of minced lung with isoprenaline (10 mumol/l) resulted in a reduction in maximum binding capacity of [125I]iodocyanopindolol to lung membranes from 246 +/- 4 to 169 +/- 6 fmol/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01, n = 18). 3. Nedocromil sodium, which had no direct effect on [125I]iodocyanopindolol binding, prevented isoprenaline-induced down-regulation, giving complete protection at a dose of 100 mumol/l. 4. The mechanism of this effect is not certain, but nedocromil sodium may interfere with the internalization of beta-adrenoceptors in pulmonary parenchymal cells. This may have some therapeutic relevance.", 
    "85": "We studied the effects of isoproterenol (ISP), dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP), and forskolin on the sodium current (INa) of guinea pig ventricular myocytes using the tight-seal, whole cell voltage-clamp method. The extracellular [Na+] [( Na+]o) was decreased to 60 mM by replacing NaCl with sucrose (temperature, 32-33 degrees C). Ionic currents other than Na+ were suppressed using appropriate channel blockers. Depolarizing clamp pulse (duration, 30 ms) was applied at a rate of 0.2 Hz from a holding potential of -80 mV. ISP (1 microM) decreased the peak INa by 34% from 6.1 +/- 1.9 (SD) nA (control) to 4.0 +/- 1.5 nA (n = 7). The inhibition was more prominent at less negative potentials and disappeared in the presence of a beta-blocker (10 microM atenolol). The effects of DBcAMP (1-5 mM) and forskolin (3 microM) mimicked those of ISP and depressed the peak INa reversibly. DBcAMP (5 mM) shifted the inactivation curve of INa [h infinity-membrane potential (Em) relationship] to a hyperpolarizing direction, by 3.4 +/- 0.8 mV (n = 5). These findings suggest that ISP inhibits the cardiac INa+, probably by altering the gating mechanism of the Na+ channel, and that the effect is secondary to the increased levels of intracellular cAMP, with possible acceleration of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the channel.", 
    "86": "Beta adrenergic receptor-mediated relaxation of blood vessels declines with age although the mechanism is unknown. We have utilized the mesenteric artery and aorta of young and older rats to investigate this problem. In vessels from 12-month-old rats there was a marked loss in relaxation mediated by beta adrenergic and adenosine receptors compared to younger rats whereas relaxation induced by muscarinic cholinergic receptors, [cyclic AMP (cAMP) independent], was not impaired. Maximal relaxation to forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP were intact in the vessels from older rats. Isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation were attenuated markedly in the vessels from the older rats. Maximal forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation were similar in older and young animals. There was an excellent correlation between cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and relaxation and the relationship was similar in the two age groups. Continuous infusion of the beta adrenergic antagonist timolol for 1 week into older animals partially restored relaxation to beta adrenergic and adenosine receptor agonists in the aorta. These results suggest that the age-related loss of response to beta adrenergic receptor agonist-induced relaxation may be due in part to attenuated activation of cAMP dependent protein kinase and this change may be partially dependent on endogenous catecholamines.", 
    "87": "To determine the role of changes in receptor density and the considerable interindividual variability in the response to beta-adrenergic antagonists, we determined the relationship between the beta-blockade produced by propranolol and the beta-adrenergic receptor density (Bmax) in 16 healthy subjects who received 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg propranolol every 8 hours for 1 day at each dosage level. The extent of beta-blockade produced was assessed as the reduction in exercise tachycardia. The extent of beta-blockade correlated with pretreatment lymphocyte Bmax (30 mg/day: r = 0.6290, p less than 0.05; 60 mg/day: r = 0.5279, p less than 0.05; 120 mg/day: r = 0.5888, p less than 0.01; 240 mg/day: r = 0.6783, p less than 0.005). When the extent of beta-blockade was corrected for plasma propranolol concentrations, the correlation was further improved (30 mg/day: r = 0.7636, p less than 0.001; 60 mg/day: r = 0.7218, p less than 0.002; 120 mg/day: r = 0.7814, p less than 0.001; 240 mg/day: r = 0.6899, p less than 0.005). We conclude that the density of beta-adrenergic receptors is one of the principal factors that control beta-receptor response to antagonists in human beings.", 
    "88": "The impact of 4 antihypertensive drug regimens on blood pressure (BP) during everyday life stress and on BP during experimental stress in the laboratory was examined in an open clinical study. Sixty middle-aged men with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension never previously treated were treated either with low-dose clonidine (n = 10), oxprenolol (n = 20), nitrendipine (n = 20) or enalapril (n = 10). Before therapy, all 4 groups did not differ in age, weight, degree of obesity, BP at work site and casual BP measured in the outpatient clinic. After 6 months of effective therapy (casual BP within the normotensive range), casual diastolic BP was identical among the 4 groups, whereas systolic BP was lower in patients treated with clonidine or oxprenolol than in those who received enalapril. A disparate pattern of antihypertensive efficacy among the 4 groups emerged when stress BP was compared, with average ambulatory BP higher in patients receiving clonidine or enalapril than in those who had oxprenolol or nitrendipine. During ambulatory BP monitoring, patients treated with oxprenolol had the lowest level at each level of physical activity and self-reported emotional arousal. During bicycle exercise, patients receiving clonidine had the highest increase in systolic BP and those administered oxprenolol the lowest, whereas the BP response during mental stress was similar among all 4 therapeutic groups. The analysis of the hemodynamic response pattern during mental stress unmasked further disparities. Oxprenolol provoked an abnormal hemodynamic response during mental stress tests (increase in total peripheral resistance), whereas nitrendipine and enalapril preserved the physiological hemodynamic profile (decrease of total peripheral resistance).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of atenolol, a beta 1-selective blocker, along with flunarizine, a calcium antagonist, in the management of Raynaud's disease. Forty patients with Raynaud's disease were randomized into a trial in which atenolol (50 mg daily) was given with flunarizine (10 mg daily). During the trial all patients were subjected to finger photoplethysmography and were given a diary to note daily the number and duration of the crises and presence or absence of pain and paresthesia. The association of atenolol with flunarizine caused an 80% reduction in the number of vasospastic crises, a significant increase (p less than 0.001) in the photoplethysmographic wave amplitude, and complete disappearance of pain and paresthesia. These results were not observed in patients treated with a placebo. Flunarizine reinforces the action of atenolol in causing a decrease in vasoconstriction in patients with Raynaud's disease, as observed previously by us, in that it acts directly on the beta-presynaptic receptors or on the calcium slow channels connected to the beta-receptors. The present study confirms that the principal role in the physiopathologic progression of Raynaud's disease seems to be played by a modification of the beta-presynaptic receptors in the nerve endings of the peripheral vessels.", 
    "90": "Experimentally acute exposure to whole-body vibration resulted in changes in myocardial blood flows in the in vivo dog. Regional myocardial blood flows measured by a hydrogen gas clearance method were increased at a vibration frequency of 120 Hz and decreased at 50 Hz. No appreciable changes were found in presence of a beta-adrenergic blocker. The values of plasma cyclic nucleotides were increased at both frequencies of vibration, more at 50 Hz than at 120 Hz. No significant changes were observed in heart rates and arterial pressure during and after vibration load. These findings suggest that increased myocardial blood flows in response to vibration may be related more to the frequency of vibration than to beta-adrenergic actions.", 
    "91": "Transient cerebral ischemia results in selective neuronal cell death. The mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability to ischemia are only beginning to be elucidated. We studied the effect of ischemia on alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding by measuring [3H]prazosin binding in gerbil forebrain membranes after 10 min of bilateral carotid occlusion. Binding was reduced from 62 +/- 3 to 33 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein. Binding in the same membranes to beta 2-adrenergic receptors were also decreased, but not to the extent of that to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Binding to muscarinic cholinergic [( 3H]quinuclydil benzilate) and beta 1-adrenergic receptors were only slightly depressed. Surprisingly, the protein content was significantly increased in the membrane fraction studied from ischemic forebrain (68 +/- 4 mg/g wet weight) compared with sham operated controls (57 +/- 4). The dramatic decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding during ischemia is consistent with receptor binding studies of membranes pretreated with phospholipase A2 in vitro. It is not clear what effect this change in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding has on subsequent selective neuronal death. The recent demonstration that catecholamines and locus ceruleus neurons influence the loss of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus suggests that it may play an important modulatory role.", 
    "92": "Fourteen patients with previously untreated essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy were treated with a fixed-dose combination of acebutolol 200 mg and nifedipine 20 mg once daily for a followup of 25.6 +/- 1.8 months. Echocardiography showed a significant decrease after a mean period of 6.6 months in interventricular septal thickness (14.8%, p less than 0.001), posterior wall thickness (14.8%, p less than 0.001), and left ventricular mass index (21.3%). After 25.6 months, the reductions were 29% (p less than 0.001), 28.1% (p less than 0.001), and 38.7% (p less than 0.001), respectively. Left wall thickness was significantly reduced, but left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and fractional shortening remained unchanged. Treatment reduced resting blood pressure from 161/102 mmHg to 132/87 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and reduced exercise blood pressure at 100 W from 208/113 mmHg to 170/94 mmHg (p less than 0.001). Thus, nifedipine in combination with acebutolol produces significant blood-pressure reduction accompanied by regression of left ventricular hypertrophy without noticeable changes in left ventricular function.",
