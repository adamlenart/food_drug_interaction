The calcium channel currents were recorded using whole-cell patch clamp technique in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes. At a holding potential of -40 mV, cells were depolarized to 0 mV for 400 ms at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. Dopexamine hydrochloride at doses of 5, 50 and 100 microM increased the verapamil-sensitive Ca2+ inward current by 109, 147 and 194%, respectively. The effects of dopexamine hydrochloride on Ca2+ current reached its maximum at 5 min and partially recovered after washout of the drugs. The increased Ca2+ current induced by dopexamine hydrochloride was completely inhibited by 20 microM propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, and was not antagonized by 20 microM of SCH23390, a highly selective D1-receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the cardiac positive inotropic effects of dopexamine hydrochloride are brought about by the increase of Ca2+ current via stimulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors.",

The histology of the tumours was squamous cell carcinoma in two cases, adenocarcinoma in one, carcinoid tumour in one, and large cell carcinoma in one. The regional blood volume and extravascular tissue density were also measured using PET. Regions of interest were drawn for both non-tumour and tumour lung tissue.",

    "5": "Of the three physiopathological types of cardiomyopathy, dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive, it is the first which characteristically shows major left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The left ventricular volumes are increased, the ventricle becomes spherical and global ejection fraction decreases with diffuse or segmental wall motion abnormalities. The left ventricular mass is increased in an excentrical fashion with wall thinning. Isovolumic contraction is slower, the ejection time is shorter and, above all, the indices of contractility such as maximal velocity of the contractile elements ... are very abnormal and do not improve after positive inotropic stimulation.", 
    "6": "Quality of life in heart failure patients is receiving increased attention as a reflection of a treatment's potential secondary benefit of general well-being and daily functioning. The Metoprolol in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (MDC) trial was conducted as a large, multicenter trial to establish the effects of metoprolol on mortality and need for heart transplantation in patients with symptomatic idiopathic cardiomyopathy. It was found that metoprolol was well tolerated, improved symptoms and cardiac function, and prevented clinical deterioration in patients with symptomatic idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Quality of life was evaluated as a secondary endpoint in 345 out of 383 randomized patients using a disease-specific questionnaire, the Quality of Life in Heart Failure Questionnaire, depicting physical activity, somatic symptoms, emotions, and life satisfaction. In a comparison of patients treated with metoprolol or placebo, patients treated with metoprolol noted a significantly more favorable response than those treated with placebo in terms of the overall treatment evaluation (p < 0.05). Additionally, an analysis of the changes from baseline to 18 months, using 95% confidence intervals, revealed that patients treated with metoprolol showed a significant improvement from baseline to 18 months in life satisfaction, physical activity, and the total score, while patients treated with placebo did not change at all. The improvement in quality of life was supported by the correlations with improvement in traditional clinical parameters.", 
    "7": "The tracheal relaxing effects and beta 2-selectivity of BDTI (1-benzyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline HBr) were investigated in canine trachea and rat heart by radioligand binding assay and pharmacological experiments in comparison with those of other beta-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol and isoprenaline. The potency of relaxing effect on carbachol-induced contraction in isolated canine trachea was in the order of isoprenaline (pD2 = 6.70 +/- 0.08) > BDTI (6.11 +/- 0.06) approximately salbutamol (6.14 +/- 0.08). ICI-118,551 (a selective beta 2-antagonist) and atenolol (a selective beta 1-antagonist) inhibited the relaxant action of BDTI with pKB values of 8.4 and 5.3, respectively, corresponding to high affinity for ICI-118,551 and low affinity for atenolol in antagonizing this response. The Kd values of radioligand ([3H]-CGP12177) were 453.3 +/- 30.8 and 563.4 +/- 96.7 pmol/l in cultured canine tracheal smooth muscle cells (TSMCs) and rat cardiomyocytes, respectively, and the Bmax values were 64.6 +/- 10.7 and 245.7 +/- 44.5 fmol/mg protein, respectively. BDTI, salbutamol and isoprenaline inhibited the binding of [3H]-CGP12177 in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured canine TSMCs (Ki 0.73 +/- 0.15, 0.75 +/- 0.21 and 0.24 +/- 0.05 mumol/l, respectively) and rat cardiomyocytes (Ki 2.76 +/- 0.36, 2.31 +/- 0.26 and 0.22 +/- 0.03 mumol/l, respectively). These results demonstrated that BDTI possessed moderate selectivity (3.8-fold) to beta 2-adrenoceptors as judged from the Ki (heart)/Ki (trachea) value (salbutamol 3.1-fold, isoprenaline 0.92-fold). BDTI and salbutamol also stimulated cAMP formation in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured canine TSMCs (EC50 0.5 +/- 0.2 and 0.4 +/- 0.1 mumol/l, respectively) and rat cardiomyocytes (EC50 6.2 +/- 0.5 and 5.7 +/- 0.6 mumol/l, respectively). The selectivity of BDTI and salbutamol for beta 2-adrenoceptors on the cAMP response were 12.4 and 14.3 times, respectively. It is concluded that BDTI is a beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist.", 
    "8": "Agitated behaviors are a common and nearly universal occurrence among patients suffering from dementing illnesses. The pharmacologic treatments available for this troubling syndrome are varied, but treatment studies are limited. Clinicians are frequently faced with the challenging management of patients with disruptive behavior who fail to respond to trials with multiple agents. This review summarizes available treatment studies of agitation in dementia and offers a guide to therapy and management. Reports of therapies for agitation in dementia are limited by lack of controlled studies, variability of diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, and small sample size. The need for carefully designed, well-controlled studies of outcome in this growing population is formidable. It is imperative to identify effective and well-tolerated treatment strategies to reduce the morbidity of these distressing and burdensome symptoms.", 
    "9": "The goal of this experiment was to determine whether modulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors influenced DMI of lactating dairy cows. Because stimulation of these receptors induces mobilization of body fat stores, the effect of such stimulation on feed intake was compared with the effect of an intravenous administration of lipid nutrients. Four treatments were infused intravenously over a 4-h period: 1) a beta 2-agonist (clenbuterol), 2) a beta-blocker (propranolol), 3) triglyceride emulsion (lipids), or 4) saline. Two trials were carried out for the same four cows to compare the effects of two expected lipolytic situations. Trial 1 used cows at 60 DIM treated with infusions from 0300 to 0700 h, and trial 2 used cows at 92 DIM treated with infusions from 0800 to 1200 h. Each trial was composed of three consecutive replications of a 4 x 4 balanced Latin square design with 2-d periods. A complete diet (70% maize silage and 30% concentrate) was offered for ad libitum intake. In both trials, clenbuterol reduced DMI on the day of infusion (-7.9 and -11.2% for trials 1 and 2, respectively) and on the following day (-5.1 and -6.3% in trials 1 and 2, respectively). This decrease occurred some time after the end of infusion. Intravenous lipid supplementation reduced DMI during infusion in both trials and during the entire day in trial 2. Both clenbuterol and lipids increased plasma NEFA only during infusion. Propranolol had no effect on DMI or basal lipolysis. The data demonstrated that stimulating beta 2-adrenoceptors reduced DMI but in a manner different from that of lipid energy supplementation.", 
    "10": "Idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (IVT) represents 10% of all cases of VT and is usually observed in young subjects. The origin of the VT may be right ventricular, especially in the infundibulum, giving rise to runs of VT with inter-critical ventricular extrasystoles of the same morphology, or to paroxysmal sustained exercise-induced VT; they usually show left bundle branch block with right axis deviation: the triggering mechanism is probably a parasystole incompletely protected from the sinus rhythm (for the runs of VT) whereas the mechanism of maintenance is probably that of triggered repetitive activity (for the runs and paroxysmal forms of VT). When the origin is in the left ventricle, the VT shows right bundle branch block and left axis deviation and is typically paroxysmal and sustained, triggered by coupled atrial stimulation and followed by a post-tachycardial syndrome; these forms are probably due to reentry into or near to the left posterior hemibranch. These forms of IVT are unique by: 1) their triggering by acceleration of the heart rate, especially during the day, on effort or during an emotion; 2) the usual absence of late ventricular potentials on surface recordings; 3) their capricious outcome, usually good with 92% survival at 10 years; 4) their response to drugs (verapamil, betablockers and/or adenosine) which are relatively ineffective against other forms of VT; 5) their tendency to recur often leading to radiofrequency ablation procedures (80% success rate). The exclusion of underlying inapparent cardiac disease (especially arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia) is an essential part of diagnosis.", 
    "11": "The Mustard and Senning procedures may be complicated by atrial tachyarrhythmias. In order to determine their prognosis, the authors undertook a review of the 288 patients operated and followed up in their department. Thirty-six (12.5%) had documented atrial tachycardias. In 13 cases, Holter monitoring showed bursts of atrial tachycardia. In the other 23 cases, the tachycardia was sustained and often caused severe symptoms (syncope). Reduction of the sustained forms was obtained by rapid atrial pacing, cardioversion or amiodarone therapy. After restoration of sinus rhythm, several therapeutic protocols were used, often in the same patient: abstention, leading to 5 recurrences in 6 cases; treatment with betablockers in 12 patients with well tolerated or exercise-induced atrial tachycardia with 11 successes; amiodarone, with 4 relapses out of 5 when the dosage was less than 200 mg/m2/day and 13 successes out of 18 when the dosage was 200-250 mg/m2/day. During a follow-up of 1 to 19 years, 6 severe complications (neurological sequellae, cardiac failure), and 6 deaths, were observed. All these patients were poorly controlled and continued to be have tachyarrhythmias. The authors conclude that tachyarrhythmias are neither rare nor always symptomatic, so justifying their systematic investigation. They should be reduced by oral amiodarone or rapid atrial pacing depending on the clinical urgency, never by intravenous antiarrhythmics which can be dangerous. The poor prognosis associated with tachyarrhythmias makes their control essential either with betablockers or good doses of amiodarone, eventually covered by permanent cardiac pacing.", 
    "12": "Calcium channel blockers have complex actions on aqueous humour dynamics that seem to depend on the route of drug administration. When applied topically, verapamil and nifedipine effectively lower intraocular pressure. However, these drugs also produce a slight reduction in aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork whereby they could modify the effect of other drugs on intraocular pressure. As calcium channel blockers could be effective in the management of ocular hypertension and low-tension glaucoma, the aim of the present work was to assess the interaction between verapamil and timolol when both drugs are topically applied to the eye of albino rabbits. Intraocular pressure was measured with a manual applanation tonometer. The effects of 5-6 different doses of each drug alone and the effects of five mixtures of both drugs at fixed concentration ratios (timolol: verapamil 4:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4) were evaluated. After measuring baseline intraocular pressure, one 50 microliters drop of the different solutions was instilled in the left eye. Measures of the intraocular pressure were repeated at intervals of 30 min until the maximal effect was reached. Each set of experiments was carried out in a group of 9-11 rabbits. Dose-response curves were fitted with a nonlinear regression microcomputer programme. The median effect plot was constructed as proposed by Chou and Talalay (1981, 1983, 1984). In order to analyse the nature of the interaction between both drugs, the observed effect was compared with the theoretically expected one and the combination indices, that relate the doses of verapamil and timolol present in the mixtures with the doses of both drugs separately which are equieffective with the combination, were calculated. The effects of verapamil and timolol followed the principle of the mass action law when administered alone. Nevertheless, no adequate dose-response relationship was obtained when the mixtures of both drugs were applied. In general, the observed effects were lower than the expected ones. Combination indices also indicate the presence of antagonism, except for the lowest concentrations of mixtures where verapamil predominates. In this case, combination indices suggest summation of effects or synergy. Both drugs seem to decrease intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor secretion through different mechanisms. However, due to the reduction of aqueous humor outflow caused by verapamil, the ocular hypotensive effect of timolol may be antagonized when high doses of verapamil are administered.", 
    "13": "Clinically based studies have indicated that patients who have suffered myocardial infarction (MI) exhibit lower heart rate variability (HRV). Such associations have not been reported at the population level. To investigate whether MI is related to lower HRV in the general population, the authors examined a stratified random sample of 2,243 men and women aged 45-64 years, of whom 260 had had MI and 1,983 were free of any coronary heart disease manifestations. All were part of the biracial cohort of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study sampled from four United States communities. Resting, 2-minute supine heart rate data were analyzed using spectral analysis to estimate high-frequency (0.16-0.35 Hz) and low-frequency (0.025-0.15 Hz) spectral powers as conventional indices of HRV. The mean levels of high-frequency powers were 1.02 and 1.23 (beats/min)2 for MI and non-MI groups, respectively (P < .05), and the low-frequency means were 2.46 and 3.11 (beats/min)2 for MI and non-MI groups, respectively (P < .01). Age, race, and sex-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of lower high-frequency and low-frequency powers contrasting MI to non-MI individuals were 1.52 (range, 1.09-2.10) and 1.54 (range, 1.12-2.10), respectively. After adjustment for use of beta-blocker medication, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.26 (range, 0.88-1.81) and 1.22 (range, 0.87-1.69) for lower high-frequency and low-frequency powers, respectively. The findings from this first population-based study of prevalent MI and HRV provide support for an inverse association between MI and lower HRV. However, adjusting for beta-blocker use eliminates the statistical association. These findings confirm that impaired HRV is found in individuals with prevalent MI, even when drawn as a sample of community-dwelling individuals. This impaired HRV may contribute to the increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events previously observed in survivors of acute MI. The cross-sectional data also suggest that use of beta-blockers diminishes the odds of lower HRV associated with MI.", 
    "14": "The secretory effects of 5-hydroxydopamine (5-OHDA) were tested in Nembutal-anaesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats injected I.V. over a wide range of doses, with and without various autonomic antagonists and Ca2+ channel blockers. Polyacrylamide disc gel (15%) and iso-electric focusing (IEF) electrophoresis by the PhastSystem were used to separate and determine the types of protein in submandibular saliva. Amylase activity of parotid saliva was determined by the blue dextran method. Salivation by the submandibular glands following application of 5-OHDA was completely abolished by both prazosin and propranolol, whereas salivation by the parotid glands was completely abolished by propranolol alone. Following application of 5-OHDA, there was a dose-related increase in flow rates and total output of protein, but not in the protein concentration and amylase activity, from both salivary glands. The effect of 5-OHDA on submandibular saliva was significantly reduced by alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, but not by beta-adrenoceptor and cholinergic blockers, nor by any Ca2+ channel blocker. The effect of 5-OHDA on the parotid gland was not significantly altered by atropine and phentolamine. However, after pretreatment with reserpine, a 95% reduction was observed in the salivation from the submandibular gland. This implies that 5-OHDA is mostly acting indirectly via release of noradrenaline. The proteins in submandibular saliva following treatment with 5-OHDA alone or 5-OHDA in combination with beta-adrenoceptor blockers were mainly of the alpha-type, whereas after treatment with 5-OHDA in combination with alpha-adrenoceptor blockers they were of the beta-type. The alpha-type was found in saliva after treatment with each of three Ca2+ channel blockers.",

    "17": "Fasted and food-effect studies of the 160mg tablet clearly established bioequivalence and revealed an unexpected reduction in nadolol bioavailability from test and reference products in the presence of food. The food-effect study of the 40mg tablet (80mg dose) revealed a similar reduction in bioavailability from each product. Fasted studies of the 40mg tablet (80mg dose) established bioequivalence in terms of AUCt and AUC infinity. However, Cmax criteria proved extremely difficult to meet in the initial 40mg fasted study because of the large variability, leading to additional studies and ultimately requiring an unreasonable number of subjects.", 
    "18": "Final results clearly established bioequivalence of both strengths and characterized an unexpected food effect which did not appear to be formulation-related. However, the Cmax of nadolol is only slightly sensitive to absorption rate and the relatively large variability of Cmax reduces its effectiveness as a bioequivalence metric. Findings suggest that bioequivalence criteria for highly variable drugs should be reconsidered.",

    "20": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive chronic cholestatic disease of the liver thought to be caused by immune destruction of the interlobular bile ducts. One-third of patients are asymptomatic and one-third of these develop symptoms within 5 years. Therapeutic regimens should be directed at the control of symptoms, prevention of complications and specific therapy aimed at controlling progression of the disease. Symptoms may be secondary to cholestasis or due to other associated diseases. The cause of pruritus secondary to cholestasis remains unknown; the anion exchange resin cholestyramine generally brings relief. In patients resistant or intolerant to this therapy, rifampin may be helpful, as well as ultraviolet light without sunblock. Liver transplantation may rarely be the only option for uncontrollable pruritus. Clinical manifestations of keratoconjunctivitis-sicca and xerostomia need constant attention to prevent corneal ulcers and dental caries. Preventative therapy includes regular screening for thyroid dysfunction and replacement therapy when necessary and the administration of the fat soluble vitamins A, D and K once hyperbilirubinaemia is present. Osteoporosis is a complication of all cholestatic liver disease. There is no satisfactory preventative therapy. It may be appropriate to give hormone replacement therapy to all post-menopausal women with PBC to reduce osteoporosis. Liver transplantation is the best option for those with fractures. Oesophageal varices may develop early in the course of PBC, non-selective beta-blocker therapy should be used as prophylaxis against variceal haemorrhage. The only specific therapy shown to cause both a biochemical and survival benefit in patients with PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Treatment with UDCA delays progression, but does not result in a cure of this disease. Currently, liver transplantation is the only definitive treatment available for end-stage disease.", 
    "21": "The effects of the chronic administration of bopindolol on the binding characteristics of [3H]CGP12177 and [3H]prazosin to cardiac alpha 1H-, alpha 1L-, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were compared with those of two other beta-blockers, atenolol and propranolol. Bopindolol (1 and 3 mg/kg/d), atenolol (50 mg/kg/d) and propranolol (60 mg/kg/d) were given to 10-week-old SHR for 12 weeks. The changes in Kd and Bmax values of the myocardium of SHR treated without and those drugs were assessed by Scatchard analysis, and the ratio and Bmax values of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes were also calculated from displacemental curves using ICI 118,551. The systolic blood pressure in SHR was dose-dependently lowered by the administration of bopindolol, and was also lowered by the administration of atenolol and propranolol. The Bmax values of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were lowered by the administration of bopindolol (1 and 3 mg/kg/d) without any changes in the Kd values or the ratio of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. Propranolol lowered 3-fold the affinity to the beta-adrenoceptor. On the other hand, the Kd and Bmax values of alpha 1H- and alpha 1L-adrenoceptor subtypes (high and low affinity binding sites for [3H]prazosin) were not changed by these drugs. These findings suggest that bopindolol had a beneficial effect on beta-adrenoceptors in the membranes of cardiac muscles of SHR, implying that these effects may contribute to lowering hypertension.", 
    "22": "1. We characterized the kinetics of presynaptic Ca2+ ion concentration in optic nerve fibers and terminals of the optic tectum in Rana pipiens with the use of microfluorimetry. Isolated frog brains were incubated with the membrane-permeant tetraacetoxymethyl ester (AM) of the Ca2+ indicator fura-2. An optic nerve shock caused a transient decrease in the 380-nm excited fluorescence in the optic tectum with a rise time of <15 ms and a recovery to prestimulus levels on a time scale of seconds. 2. In normal saline, the amplitude of the fluorescence transients was dependent on stimulus intensity and at all levels it was directly correlated with the amplitude of postsynaptic field potentials produced by activation of unmyelinated optic nerve fibers. In the presence of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, the amplitude and time course of fluorescence transients remained essentially unchanged while postsynaptic field potential amplitude was greatly reduced. Replacing extracellular Ca2+ with Ba2+ blocked unfacilitated postsynaptic field potentials while fluorescence transients remained significant. In reduced-Ca2+ salines (<1 mM), the amplitude of fluorescence transients increased approximately linearly with extracellular [Ca2+], whereas the amplitude the corresponding field potential was nonlinearly related to the fluorescent transient amplitude (approximately 2.5 power). In thin sections of labeled tecta, fluorescence labeling was localized to 1-micron puncta in the termination zone of optic nerve fibers in the superficial layers. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that the fluorescence transients correspond to an increase in Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals of unmyelinated optic nerve fibers. 3. During trains of optic nerve stimulation, the amplitude of fluorescence transients to succeeding action potentials became smaller. The decrement of the amplitudes was not observed in mag-fura-5-labeled tecta, when the intracellular Ca2+ buffering capacity of fura-2-labeled terminals was increased by incubation with bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-AM or ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)-AM, or in low-Ca2+ saline. We conclude that the Ca2+ influx per action potential is constant during the train and that the reduced response was produced by saturation of the fura-2. We provide a mathematical analysis of this saturation effect and use it to estimate the Ca2+ change per action potential. 4. Both BAPTA-AM and EGTA-AM reduced the overall amplitude of fura-2-measured Ca2+ transients and reduced the saturation effect in action potential trains. However, there was a qualitative difference in their effects on the shape of the transient. Incubation with the fast buffer BAPTA prolonged the decay to baseline. In contrast, the slow buffer EGTA (or EDTA) produced an initial decay faster than the control condition while also producing the slower subsequent phase observed with BAPTA. We demonstrate that these results are consistent with numerical simulations of Ca2+ dynamics in a single-compartment model where the fast initial decay is produced by the forward rate of Ca2+ binding to EGTA. 5. Ca2+ influx into tectal presynaptic structures, and also into unmyelinated axons in the isolated optic nerve, was diminished (60-70%) in the presence of the voltage-activated Ca2+ channel blocker omega-conotoxin GVIA, but was only weakly affected (approximately 10%) by omega-agatoxin IVA. 6. After 10- to 50-Hz stimulus trains, synaptic enhancement of unmyelinated fibers decayed with a characteristic time similar to fura-2 fluorescence decays. Incubation with EDTA-AM or EGTA-AM produced little effect on evoked release but reduced both the amplitude of the fura-2-measured Ca2+ transient and the amplitude of short-term synaptic enhancement.",

This antihypertensive effect was at least as good with celiprolol as with atenolol.

    "28": "This was a double-blind, within-patient, crossover study to evaluate the effects of a new formulation of metoprolol on blood pressure (BP) and myocardial ischemia. Twenty outpatients with mild to moderate essential arterial hypertension, chronic stable angina pectoris and positive exercise test, after a 2-week baseline placebo period, were randomized to receive long-acting metoprolol (OROS) 14/190 mg o.d., nifedipine SR 20 mg b.i.d. or their combination in a sequence of a 3 x 3 Latin square design. Two patients withdrew from the study (1 for adverse event during metoprolol and 1 for rise of BP during nifedipine). Nifedipine, metoprolol and their combination significantly reduced the weekly number of angina attacks and nitroglycerin consumption with respect to baseline. The total number of ischemic events (at 24-hour ECG monitoring) significantly decreased after each treatment with respect to baseline. Twenty-four hours mean systolic and diastolic BP were reduced by both nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone; the combination of the two drugs led to a further decrease in both systolic and diastolic BP. The duration of silent ischemic episodes was significantly reduced by nifedipine and combination but not by metoprolol. On the other hand 24 hours symptomatic attacks/patient were significantly reduced by beta-blocker and combination, but not by nifedipine. Metoprolol alone and administered with nifedipine caused a decrease, with respect to placebo baseline, in 24-hour mean heart rate (HR) and reduced the increase of HR and systolic BP at the onset of ST depression during symptomatic ischemic episodes. The effort time and time to ST = -1 mm at treadmill were significantly increased by treatment with nifedipine alone, with metoprolol alone and with their combination, but the combination was more effective than the individual therapies. ST depression at peak exercise was significantly reduced by each treatment. The slopes of correlations between the ST-segment variation and systolic BP, HR and rate-pressure product during exercise, significantly decreased after all treatments with respect to placebo baseline, more with the combination therapy than with nifedipine alone and metoprolol alone. In conclusion, based on our results the favourable interaction of metoprolol OROS and nifedipine given concomitantly, is likely to be due to a better control, respect to each individual therapy, of the pathogenetic mechanism of myocardia ischemia: BP and HR increases during exercise and during symptomatic ischemic episodes are controlled by the beta-blocker and coronary vasoconstriction during silent ischemia is prevented by the calcium-antagonist.",

Validity of office and home blood pressure readings is discussed with attention to a variety of measurement artifacts in the elderly. The efficacy of lifestyle modifications is summarized. The 1994 recommendation (of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Hypertension in the Elderly) to begin antihypertensive drug therapy with low doses of a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic is defended. Guidelines also are provided for the safe use of alternate or second-line drugs including the beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "30": "A high prevalence of hypercalciuria has been reported in patients with essential hypertension. Nevertheless, the clinical and therapeutic implications of this finding have scarcely been studied. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of hypercalciuria in an unselected population with essential hypertension and to analyze the relationship between the urinary calcium and the clinical and therapeutic status of these patients. This article presents a prospective study of 112 patients with essential hypertension and 49 healthy normotensive control subjects. Urinary excretion rates of calcium, sodium, chloride, potassium, urinary calcium/creatinine index, the fractional excretion of sodium, potassium and uric acid, the creatinine clearance and serum values of creatinine, urea, uric acid, electrolytes, total proteins, parathormone (intact molecule), plasma renin activity, aldosterone, glucose, and insulin (fasting and after an oral glucose load) were performed in every patient and control subject. Untreated hypertensive patients had a higher prevalence of hypercalciuria (35% had a urinary calcium/creatinine ratio > 0.20 versus 20% of treated hypertensives and 2% of control subjects; P < 0.001). Patients on thiazide or beta-blocker monotherapy had lower urinary excretion rates of calcium and urate than patients on calcium-antagonist monotherapy or untreated patients. Urinary calcium, sodium, and urate correlated positively both in treated and untreated essential hypertension patients. Patients with the higher urinary calcium levels also had higher excretion rates of sodium and urate, higher creatinine clearance rates, and lower serum creatinine and serum uric acid levels. It was concluded that hypercalciuria is a frequent finding of untreated essential hypertension. The association of high urinary calcium levels with high urinary urate excretion rates in the same patient may predispose to development of lithiasis in patients with essential hypertension. Antihypertensive drugs have a variable effect on calciuria-uricosuria, which may constitute an additional criterion in the selection and individualization of therapy. Thiazides and beta-blockers can decrease calciuria and uricosuria and, therefore, the lithogenic risk in these patients.", 
    "31": "Children presenting with hypertension should be considered for emergency treatment when there is evidence of end-organ toxicity. Complications of extreme hypertension may be very serious, even life threatening, with the potential for life-long sequelae. Of greatest significance is damage to the central nervous system. Treatment of hypertensive emergencies should be directed toward the lowering of blood pressure enough to reduce toxicity, but not at a rate likely to cause hypoperfusion of vital organs. This blood pressure reduction should, in general, be carefully controlled in an intensive care unit, with attention to central nervous system, cardiac, and renal function. Intravenous agents are preferable under these circumstances, due to greater ease in modulating blood pressure. In the absence of specific contraindications, a continuous infusion of nicardipine or sodium nitroprusside is preferable. Intravenous labetalol by bolus injection, followed by continuous infusion, also may be used. Oral agents should be reserved for circumstances in which symptoms of end-organ toxicity are mild or absent. Since general pediatricians have limited experience with the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, consultation with physicians experienced in treating hypertensive emergencies is suggested when possible.",

    "42": "The beta 3-adrenergic receptor, located mainly in fat cells of visceral adipose tissue, is involved in the regulation of lipolysis and thermogenesis. Recently, a mutation in the corresponding gene resulting in the replacement of tryptophan by arginine in position 64 (Trp64Arg) has been demonstrated, which associated with obesity and metabolic complications of obesity. We have investigated whether this polymorphism is associated with changes in beta 3-adrenergic receptor function or clinical characteristics in 40 non-obese and 43 obese non-diabetic subjects who underwent elective abdominal surgery. The beta-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphism was examined by restriction-enzyme cleavage conformation. Beta 3-adrenergic receptor function was investigated by measuring lipolysis in isolated visceral white fat cells incubated with noradrenaline (natural ligand) or (CGP) 12,177 (selective beta 3-agonist). No homozygotes for the mutation were found. The allelic frequency of Trp64Arg was similar in obese and non-obese subjects (9.4 and 12.5%, respectively). In obese and non-obese subjects there was no change in body mass index, body fat distribution, fat cell size, fasting circulating levels of insulin, glucose or lipids, blood pressure or adipocyte lipolysis induced by noradrenaline or CGP 12,177 when Trp64Arg heterozygotes were compared with Trp64A homozygotes. Our results suggest that the Trp64Arg mutation in its heterozygous form is not a major determinant of beta 3-adrenergic receptor function (when assessed by lipolysis in white adipose tissue) or of the pathophysiology of obesity.", 
    "43": "The adrenergic regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis in response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (intravenous infusion of soluble insulin 0.10 IU.kg body weight-1.h-1 until the arterial plasma glucose fell below 2.8 mmol/l) was investigated directly in vivo in 11 insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients and 12 control subjects, using microdialysis of the extracellular space of abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The tissue glycerol level (lipolysis index) and the escape of ethanol from the perfusion medium (blood flow index) were continuously monitored. During insulin infusion the arterial glucose level was reduced in parallel and the hypoglycaemic nadir was almost identical in the two groups (diabetic patients 2.2 +/- 0.1 and control subjects 2.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/l). While the maximum response of plasma epinephrine to hypoglycaemia was 30% lower in diabetic patients than in the control subjects (p < 0.05), the glycerol levels in adipose tissue and in plasma, as well as in serum non-esterified fatty acids, increased twice as much in the former as in the latter group following hypoglycaemia (p < 0.01). Addition of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol (10(4) mol/l) to the tissue perfusate almost completely prevented the hypoglycaemia-induced increase in the adipose tissue glycerol level in both groups, whereas in situ perfusion with 10(-4) mol/l of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine resulted in an additional increase in the tissue glycerol levels; during alpha-blockade, the glycerol response to hypoglycaemia remained enhanced by threefold in the diabetic patients (p < 0.01). In both groups local adipose tissue blood flow increased transiently in a similar way after hypoglycaemia; the increase being inhibited by in situ beta-adrenoceptor blockade. We conclude that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms regulate adipose tissue lipolysis in response to hypoglycaemia. In IDDM, lipolysis is markedly enhanced following hypoglycaemia, despite a reduced catecholamine secretory response, because of increased beta-adrenoceptor action in adipose tissue.", 
    "44": "1. The cell-attached and cell-free configurations of the patch-clamp technique were used to investigate whether external ATP and its derivatives modulate channel activity in outer hair cells freshly isolated from the guinea-pig cochlea. 2. Submicromolar concentrations of ATP stimulated a non-selective cation channel with a conductance of about 25 pS. The ATP-elicited stimulation was partly blocked by the membrane-permeant blocker 3',5-dichlorodiphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid (DCDPC), and mimicked by the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, suggesting that the channel activated by ATP is identical to a previously reported calcium-activated non-selective (CAN) cation channel. 3. The P2x agonist beta, gamma-methylene-ATP (beta, gamma-MeATP, 10 microM) and the P2Y agonist 2-methyl-thio-ATP (2-MeSATP, 1 microM) both activated CAN channels. The effect of ATP was inhibited by the P2 antagonist suramin but not by the P2Y antagonist Reactive Blue 2. These results suggest that both purinergic receptors are involved in the ATP-evoked response and that internal calcium acts as a second messenger for opening CAN channels. 4. In contrast, adenosine inhibited CAN channels. This effect was reproduced by the A2 agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine (NECA) and the permeant cAMP analogue 8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP), but not by the A1 agonist N6-cyclo-hexyladenosine (CHA). CAN channels were also inhibited when the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was applied internally on inside-out patches, suggesting that adenosine A2 receptor downregulates CAN channels via a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation.",

ATP, UTP and 2MeSATP (10 microM) evoked fast, transient (2-20 s duration) and slow, sustained (60-120 s duration) inward currents in 118 of 285 follicular Xenopus oocytes but failed to activate inward currents in defolliculated Xenopus oocytes (n = 136). 2. The potency order for nucleotides was (at 10 microM): UTP = 2MeSATP > 2ClATP = ATP > ADP > alpha, beta-methylene-ATP > adenosine > ITP, with beta, gamma-methylene-ATP, CTP and GTP inactive. This potency order is atypical for any single P2 purinoceptor subtype. 3. EC50 values (for fast and slow inward currents) were (microM): ATP, 5.6 +/- 2.1 and 6.7 +/- 3.0; UTP, 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 0.9 +/- 0.3; 2MeSATP, 0.6 +/- 0.2 and 9.2 +/- 7.4 (n = 3). Suramin inhibited fast (IC50: 65 +/- 20 microM; n = 7) and slow (IC50: 57 +/- 10 microM; n = 7) inward currents evoked by ATP. Suramin also inhibited slow inward currents produced by UTP but potentiated those caused by 2MeSATP. 4. Fast and slow inward currents evoked in response to ATP and UTP reversed at -12 +/- 3 mV (n = 3), a value close to Erev for Na(+)-permeable ion channels present in oocytes. These same currents were reduced significantly when extracellular Na+ was substituted with choline and Erev changed to -30 +/- 5 mV (n = 3). Inward currents evoked by ATP and UTP were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by amiloride (10-100 microM). 5. Fast and slow inward currents caused by 2MeSATP reversed at -29 +/- 3 mV (n = 3), a value close to Erev for Cl- channels in oocytes. Fast and slow responses to 2MeSATP were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the Cl- channel blocker NPPB (10-100 microM) and were only reduced slightly by amiloride (100 microM). 6. We conclude that two P2 purinoceptor subtypes are present on follicular Xenopus oocytes. 2MeSATP activates fast and slow Cl- currents (Erev = -30 mV) via a suramin-insensitive P2Y purinoceptor, while UTP and ATP activate fast and slow Na(+)-dependent currents (Erev = -10 mV) via a suramin-sensitive P2U purinoceptor.",

Significant ST-segment elevation was defined as a shift > or = 1 mm during dobutamine compared to baseline in at least two contiguous infarct-related leads; a correlation was made between the site of ST-segment elevation and wall motion changes during dobutamine. Dobutamine-induced ST-segment elevation in 23/42 (55%) patients (group 1) while no changes were observed in 19/23 (45%) patients (group 2). Compared to group 2, group 1 patients showed a higher asynergy score index (1.72 +/- 0.24 vs 1.50 +/- 0.32, P < 0.02) and a higher number of asynergic segments (5.04 +/- 1.9 vs 4.11 +/- 1.8), at baseline, a higher incidence of baseline and/or stress-induced dyskinesia (39 vs 10%, P < 0.05) in the infarct-related region and a higher percentage of occluded infarct-related arteries (48 vs 0%, P < 0.001). In the 42 patients studied, a significant correlation was found between baseline ST-segment elevation and baseline asynergy score index (RS = 0.56, P < 0.001) and between ST-segment elevation and asynergy score index at peak stress (RS = 0.55, P < 0.001). The incidence of reversible wall motion abnormalities indicative of myocardial viability and residual myocardial ischaemia was similar in the two groups (87 vs 84% and 74 vs 68%, respectively), while the number of segments with irreversible akinesia indicative of myocardial necrosis was higher in group 1 compared to group 2 (1.5 +/- 1.4 vs 0.9 +/- 1.4). Among the 23 patients of group 1 with dobutamine-induced ST-segment elevation, six had no reversible wall motion abnormalities indicative of myocardial ischaemia; of the 17 patients with myocardial ischaemia, 11 had > or = 50% and six had < or = 50% of basally asynergic segments showing reversible wall motion abnormalities.",

    "49": "Microglia, like other tissue macrophages, are a component of the hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine-immune axis and, as such, are responsive to both neural and endocrine factors. Using cultured neonatal hamster microglia, we have examined the effect of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, and dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, on superoxide anion production. For these experiments, microglia were pretreated with isoproterenol or dexamethasone and then induced to produce superoxide anion by exposure of the cells to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Our study demonstrates that the PMA-stimulated production of superoxide anion was decreased by acute (30 min) and chronic (24 h) pretreatment of the microglia with isoproterenol and was blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol. Since a rise in intracellular cAMP may be a prime factor in the inhibition of superoxide anion production in isoproterenol-treated cells, we used forskolin, a known activator of the adenylate cyclase in place of isoproterenol and re-investigate superoxide anion production. Short term exposures to forskolin produced a lower amount of superoxide anion than PMA-stimulated alone and, thus, mimicked the effect of isoproterenol. However, treatment with the same concentration of forskolin for 24 h prior to the induction of the NADPH oxidase did not significantly change PMA-stimulated superoxide anion production from untreated values. Thus, chronic exposure to forskolin produced a different effect than chronic exposure to isoproterenol. Isoproterenol and forskolin both increased immunoreactivity for the protein products of the early response genes, c-fos and c-jun. Pretreatment with dexamethasone for 24 h also inhibited superoxide anion production and was blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. The simultaneous addition of varying concentrations of dexamethasone and 5 microM isoproterenol did not produce a greater inhibition in superoxide anion production than either agent alone. The down-regulation of microglial function by adrenergic agonists and by glucocorticoids provides a way in which the cytotoxicity of these immune cells can be reduced and may be a factor in the paracrine regulation of microglia.", 
    "50": "The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and side-effects of pindolol, a beta-blocker, in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Fifty-two ADHD children, 7-13 years old, participated in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled comparison of pindolol and methylphenidate (MPH). Active treatment was pindolol and MPH: pindolol 20 mg b.i.d. or MPH 10 mg b.i.d. for 4 weeks. The outcome was assessed on the basis of the Abbreviated Conners Rating Scales (ACRS) completed by parents, teachers, and by a psychologist during psychological testing. Pindolol treatment was associated with a higher incidence of paraesthesias and with more intense nightmares and hallucinations than MPH or placebo treatment. These side-effects led to an interim change in design by ending pindolol treatment after 32 participants. Pindolol proved to be just as effective as MPH in decreasing hyperactivity and conduct problems at home, and hyperactivity problems at school. Pindolol, however, had less therapeutic effects than MPH during psychological testing, and failed to affect conduct problems in school. In sum, pindolol was modestly effective in the treatment of ADHD. Safety concerns on troubling side-effects clearly limit the use of it.",

    "56": "Calcium channel blockers can block calcium signals that trigger cell differentiation and apoptosis, which are important mechanisms of cancer growth regulation. To ascertain whether calcium channel blocker use was associated with an increased risk of cancer, 750 hypertensive persons age > or = 71 years, with no history of cancer at baseline, were followed from 1988 through 1992. The patients were using either beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem; mainly of the short-acting variety). Compared to beta-blockers (n = 424, 28 events), after adjusting for age, gender, race, smoking, body mass index, and number of hospital admissions not related with cancer, the relative risks of cancer (95% confidence interval) for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 124, 6 events) and calcium channel blockers (n = 202, 27 events) were 0.73 (0.30 to 1.78) and 2.02 (1.16 to 3.54), respectively. These findings indicate that calcium channel blocker therapy might increase the risk of cancer. New data are needed in patients using modern calcium channel blocker agents with more gradual absorption. This report should encourage further study of cancer outcomes in elderly patients who are vulnerable to cancer and who are receiving calcium channel blockers.", 
    "57": "The 4 major classes of antihypertensive drugs are diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists. The diuretics have recently regained prominence, largely due to the results of recent controlled trials. These trials in elderly patients demonstrated that low-dose diuretics were effective not only in preventing stroke but also in greatly reducing coronary-related events. Diuretics also decrease left ventricular mass more than the other major drug classes. In addition, they are the most effective drugs for use in combination therapy. By contrast, the safety of calcium antagonists has recently been questioned because of report of increased coronary morbidity and mortality. However, these adverse events may be restricted to the short-acting preparations, especially nifedipine, which causes cardiac stimulation. ACE inhibitors, like beta-blockers, are not only effective in reducing blood pressure, particularly when combined with a diuretic, but also improve angina and decrease postinfarction mortality. They also benefit congestive heart failure, stabilise or improve renal function in hypertensive and diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria. Beta-Blockers are especially effective in reducing sudden cardiac death in patients with coronary heart disease, particularly in postinfarction patients. Final proof of the relative effectiveness of these drugs in preventing morbidity and mortality must await the outcome of large comparative trials currently under way. A recent national survey in the US found that more than 75% of hypertensive patients did not have their hypertension completely controlled. Possible reasons for this disturbing statistic are discussed along with suggestions for improvement.", 
    "58": "The ultra-short-acting and vasorelaxant beta 1-adrenoceptor blocking activities of vasomolol, a guaiacoxypropanolamine derivative of vanillic acid ethyl ester, were studied. Vasomolol (0.5, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.) produced a dose-dependent bradycardia response and demonstrated particularly a hypotensive action with an ultra-short-acting property in pentobarbital-anesthetized normotensive rats. Vasomolol's steady state of beta-blockade was attained < or = 10 min after initial infusion, and a rapid recovery from blockade occurred after discontinuation of the infusion, although intravenous infusion of vasomolol (300 micrograms/kg/min) could not inhibit pressor responses induced by (-)phenylephrine (10 micrograms/kg i.v.). In isolated rat thoracic aorta, vasomolol (1-10 microM) inhibited vascular smooth muscle contractions induced by both (-)phenylephrine (10(-5) M) and high K+ (75 mM) concentration dependently. This inhibitory effect of vasomolol was more sensitive on K(+)-induced than on (-)phenylephrine-induced contractions, suggesting that the block of Ca2+ influx may involve the major mechanism of vasorelaxation. In isolated guinea pig tissues, vasomolol (0.01-10 microM) antagonized the (-)isoproterenol (ISO)-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)ISO suggested that vasomolol was a beta-adrenoceptor competitive antagonist. The effect of vasomolol was more potent on atria than on tracheal tissues, indicating that it possesses beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity. In addition, vasomolol did not show intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). Moreover, the binding characteristics of vasomolol were evaluated in [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding to porcine ventricular membranes. Vasomolol was an ultra-short-acting and highly selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasorelaxant activity and is devoid of ISA.",

Left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) was significantly lower in male than in female patients (32 +/- 7 vs. 35 +/- 7%, p < 0.001). A history of heart failure was as frequent in men (6%) as in women (6%), but left ventricular systolic dysfunction was more frequent in men than in women (25 vs. 12%, p < 0.005). The ratio of early/late diastolic peak flow velocity (E/A ratio) was significantly lower, indicating diastolic dysfunction, in female patients with clinical heart failure than in those without (0.79 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.3, p < 0.05). No such difference was found in male patients. Inverse relationships were found between age and E/A ratio in both controls (r = -0.45, p < 0.001) and angina patients (r = -0.44, p < 0.001). Thus, despite similar frequency of clinical heart failure, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was more common in men than in women with stable angina.", 
    "60": "Blood pressure and heart rate were measured by telemetry in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) to investigate the contribution of angiotensin II to the reflex tachycardia resulting from exaggerated hypotension caused by a high dose of a calcium channel blocker. Pre-treatment with TCV-116, an angiotensin II AT1 receptor antagonist, or enalapril partially attenuated the reflex tachycardia induced by manidipine, but TCV-116 had almost no effect on the sinus tachycardia induced by isoproterenol. The suppressive effects of TCV-116 against the reflex tachycardia tended to be more obvious in WKY than in SHR, though the difference was not statistically significant. Concurrent administration of propranolol almost completely inhibited both the reflex tachycardia and the sinus tachycardia in SHR and WKY, indicating that the sympathetic nervous system contributes to both types of tachycardia. We demonstrated that angiotensin II may be involved in the reflex tachycardia induced by calcium channel blockers probably via activation of some component of the sympathetic nervous system other than postsynaptic factors at the sinus node.",

    "65": "In vertebrates, the circadian rhythm in the activity of serotonin N-acetyltransferase [arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT); EC 2.3.1.87] drives the daily rhythm in circulating melatonin. We have discovered that expression of the AA-NAT gene in the rat pineal gland is essentially turned off during the day and turned on at night, resulting in a more than 150-fold rhythm. Expression is regulated by a photoneural system that acts through an adrenergic-cAMP mechanism in pinealocytes, probably involving cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation. Turning off AA-NAT expression appears to involve de novo synthesis of a protein that attenuates transcription. A approximately 10-fold night/day rhythm in AA-NAT messenger RNA occurs in the retina, and AA-NAT messenger RNA is also detected at low levels in the brain.", 
    "66": "We have recently shown in rats that an in vivo treatment with catecholamines via alpha 2-receptors leads to a pronounced suppression of T- and B-cell mitogen responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), provided that a beta-blocker is administered concomitantly. Since melatonin (MEL) reportedly has stress-protective effects on several immune functions, and since the release of MEL from the pineal gland is inhibited by beta-blockade, we tested the effect of MEL substitution on T- and B-cell mitogen responses of PBL in rats treated with two s.c. implanted retard tablets containing noradrenaline (NA) and propranolol. It was found that an oral treatment with MEL (about 40 micrograms/animal) abolished the adrenergic immunosuppression. Furthermore, functional pinealectomy induced by constant light had a similar enhancing effect on the alpha 2-adrenergic immunosuppression as observed with beta-blockers, whereas PBL from animals kept at the regular light/dark interval were resistant to the treatment with the selective alpha 2-agonist clonidine. It is concluded that endogenous MEL effectively protects rat PBL from adrenergic immunosuppression, and that beta-blockers enhance the immunosuppressive property of alpha 2-adrenergic agents via blocking the night-time release of MEL.", 
    "67": "Because the renin-angiotensin system is activated in heart failure, we hypothesized that angiotensin II (ANG II) plays a role in altering baroreflex sensitivity in the setting of heart failure. Accordingly, we evaluated the baroreflex control of heart rate (HR) in conscious, chronically instrumented rabbits in the normal state and after the establishment of heart failure. Heart failure was induced by rapid ventricular pacing at a rate of 360-380 beats/min for an average of 14.5 +/- 1.4 days. The data were compared with normal rabbits instrumented in a similar fashion. Baroreflex curves were generated by inflation of implanted hydraulic occluders on the vena cava and aortic arch or by administration of phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. Experiments were carried out before and after intravenous administration of the AT1 antagonist L-158,809. Rabbits with heart failure exhibited significantly lower arterial pressure (81 +/- 3 vs. 69 +/- 4 mmHg, P < 0.05), elevated resting HR (230 +/- 5 vs. 260 +/- 10 beats/min, P < 0.05), and elevated left atrial pressure (3.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 13.1 +/- 0.7 mmHg, P < 0.05). ANG II blockade had little effect on resting or baroreflex parameters in normal rabbits. However, in rabbits with heart failure, L-158,809 enhanced baroreflex sensitivity (2.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.8 beats.min-1.mmHg-1; P < 0.05), primarily by increasing the minimum HR evoked during baroreceptor activation. beta 1-Blockade had no effect on any baroreflex parameter after L-158,809 in rabbits with heart failure. However, L-158,809 significantly reduced the minimum HR after pretreatment with atropine in rabbits with heart failure. These data suggest that ANG II plays a role in modulation of cardiac sympathetic tone in this model of heart failure and may be responsible for the depressed baroreflex sensitivity observed in heart failure.",

    "70": "The TIBBS trial was an 8-week, randomized, controlled comparison of the effects of bisoprolol and nifedipine on transient ischemic episodes in patients with stable angina pectoris. Of the 545 patients screened, 520 (95.4%) could be followed up. Rates of cardiac and noncardiac death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina and need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were recorded.", 
    "71": "A total of 145 events occurred in 120 (23.1%) of 520 patients. Patients with more than six episodes had an event rate of 32.5% compared with 25.0% for patients with two to six episodes and 13.2% for patients with less than two episodes (p < 0.001). Hard events (death, acute myocardial infarction, hospital admission for unstable angina pectoris) were more frequent in patients with two or more ischemic episodes (12.2% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.0049). Patients with a 100% response rate of transient ischemic episodes during the TIBBS trial had a 17.5% event rate at 1 year compared with 32.3% for non-100% responders (p = 0.008). Patients receiving bisoprolol during the TIBBS tria had a lower event rate (22.1%) at 1 year than patients randomized to nifedipine (33.1%, p = 0.033).",

The greater reduction of ischemia with bisoprolol than nifedipine during the TIBBS trial translated into an improved outcome at 1 year.", 
    "73": "Recent research has cast doubt on the ischemic hypothesis of etiology of syndrome X (anginal pain, ischemic-like changes in the stress electrocardiogram, but normal coronary arteriogram). Abnormalities of pain perception have been shown and abnormal sympathetic nervous system activation has also been implicated. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that downregulation of myocardial beta adrenoceptors is demonstrable in patients with syndrome X. Such downregulation would be consistent with raised myocardial catecholamine concentrations. We performed positron emission tomography with (11)C-CGP-12177 to measure beta-adrenoceptor density. Plasma catecholamines were sampled simultaneously and assayed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Twenty syndrome X patients (11 female, age 57 +/- 9 SD years, range 33 to 69) and 18 matched controls (9 women, age 50 +/- 13 years, range 25 to 65; p = NS vs patients) were studied. Myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density did not differ between syndrome X patients and controls: 8.0 (1.9) pmol/g for patients versus 8.3 (2.1) pmol/g for controls; p = 0.62. No differences were found between patients and controls for plasma norepinephrine (2.82 [1.07] and 2.76 [1.18] nM, respectively; p = 0.89) or for epinephrine (0.29 [0.14] and 0.30 [0.20] nM, respectively; p = 0.84). In patients with syndrome X, beta-adrenoceptor density is normal and, by inference, myocardial catecholamines would also be normal. This weakens the case for a generalized enhancement of sympathetic activation in this disorder, although increased sympathetic reactivity during actual episodes of chest pain remains a possibility.", 
    "74": "Beta-blockers reduce infarct size and improve survival after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Post-MI angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition also improves survival and may attenuate left ventricular (LV) dilatation. We evaluated the effect of early enalapril treatment on LV volumes and ejection fraction (EF) in patients on concomitant beta-blockade after MI. Intravenous enalaprilat or placebo was administered <24 hours after MI and was continued orally for 6 months. LV volumes were assessed by echocardiography 3 +/- 2 days, 1 and 6 months after MI. Change in LV diastolic volume during the first month was attenuated with enalapril (2.7 vs placebo 6.5 ml/m2 change; p < 0.05), and significantly lower LV diastolic and systolic volumes were observed with enalapril treatment compared with placebo at 1 month (enalapril 47.21 23.9 vs placebo 53.1/29.2 ml/m2; p < 0.05) and at 6 months (enalapril 47.9/24.8 vs placebo 53.8/29.6 ml/m2; p < 0.05). EF was also significantly higher 1 month after MI in these patients (enalapril 50.4% vs placebo 46.4%; p < 0.05). Our date demonstrate that early enalapril treatment attenuates LV volume expansion and maintains lower LV volumes and higher EF in patients receiving concurrent beta-blockade after MI. A possible additive effect of combined therapy should be evaluated prospectively.", 
    "75": "In an effort to reduce energy requirements for atrial defibrillation to a level low enough to perform painless electrical cardioversion with an implantable atrial defibrillator, we tested the hypothesis that drug therapy with the class III agent d-sotalol, when used concurrently with a low-energy shock, reduces atrial defibrillation threshold. In a nonthoracotomy canine model of atrial fibrillation, intracardiac shocks were delivered between the distal coronary sinus and the mid-right atrium. Based on a step-up energy delivery protocol the atrial defibrillation threshold was defined as the least amount of energy that resulted in a >10% and <90% rate of successful defibrillation. At a dose associated with class III antiarrhythmic effects (5 mg/kg), d-sotalol significantly reduced atrial defibrillation threshold from 1.72 +/- 1.12 J to 0.59 +/- 0.60 J (p < 0.01). These results support the feasibility of using antiarrhythmic drug therapy with d-sotalol to minimize energy requirements for intracardiac electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "76": "We examined the role of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor (AR) density and ratio in catecholamine-stimulated cAMP responses in rat C6 glioma cells. These cells, which normally express both subtypes, were stably transfected with an isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside-inducible vector containing either beta 1AR or beta 2AR coding sequences, and receptor expression was controlled by the time and concentration of isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside exposure. Induction of the dominant beta 1AR subtype increased the potencies of isoproterenol (ISO) and other agonists in stimulating cAMP accumulation by 20-40-fold without changing maximal response. Induction of beta 2AR expression caused 7-13-fold increases in the potency of ISO, epinephrine, and zinterol, but not of norepinephrine, and a 20-40% loss in maximal response to all agonists. Selective antagonists showed that both subtypes contributed in a nonadditive manner in the response to ISO under different conditions. After beta 2AR induction, the effects of ISO were not blocked by the beta 1-selective antagonist CGP 20712A but were shifted 100-fold to the right by the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. However, in the presence of ICI 118,551, CGP 20712A caused an additional 100-fold decrease in ISO potency, and Schild analysis revealed complex interactions between the two subtypes. Each antagonist alone caused smaller shifts to the right in the dose-response curve to NE and, when present simultaneously, completely abolished the NE response. We conclude that beta 1ARs and beta 2ARs have different efficiencies in activating cAMP accumulation in C6 glioma cells. Activation of coexisting subtypes results in complex and sometimes synergistic interactions between the two subtypes, which vary with agonist concentration, selectivity, subtype density, and ratio.", 
    "77": "Neural control of the cardiac responses to exercise in air (running) and under water (diving) was studied in the muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) by means of acute pharmacological blockade with the muscarinic blocker atropine and the beta-adrenergic blocker nadolol. Saline injection was used as a control. Controls running on a treadmill showed a marked increase in heart rate with exercise. Atropine-treated animals had a higher resting heart rate than controls, but heart rate still increased with running. Nadolol-treated animals had a lower resting heart rate than controls and displayed a less pronounced increase in heart rate with running than controls. Animals treated with a combination of atropine and nadolol had a resting heart rate similar to that of controls but their heart rate was unaffected by running. Thus, exercise tachycardia in muskrats is due to activation of the sympathetic system and also to a reduction in parasympathetic tone. Heart rate decreased markedly during voluntary submergence in controls but rose as muskrats swam submerged against increasing water flows. Nevertheless, diving bradycardia was still present. Free-diving bradycardia and the relative increase in heart rate with underwater exercise were abolished by atropine and unaffected by nadolol. Hence, unlike the cardiac response to exercise in air, the cardiac response to underwater exercise is due only to a reduction in parasympathetic tone. Injection of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol markedly increased heart rate in air but had little effect during voluntary and forced dives, indicating a marked decrease in the sensitivity of cardiac cells to adrenergic stimulation during submergence. These results strongly suggest that accentuated antagonism between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system occurs during diving so that parasympathetic influences on the heart predominate and inhibit any chronotropic response to adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "78": "Infection of the bovine lung with Pasteurella haemolytica results in an acute respiratory disorder known as pneumonic pasteurellosis. One of the key virulence determinants used by this bacterium is secretion of an exotoxin that is specific for ruminant leukocytes (leukotoxin). At low concentrations, the leukotoxin can activate ruminant leukocytes, whereas at higher concentrations, it inhibits leukocyte functions and is cytolytic, presumably as a result of pore formation and subsequent membrane permeabilization. We have investigated the possibility that the activation-inhibition paradox is explained in part by leukotoxin-mediated apoptosis (i.e., activation-induced cell death) of bovine leukocytes. Incubation of bovine leukocytes with P. haemolytica leukotoxin caused marked cytoplasmic membrane blebbing (zeiosis) and chromatin condensation and margination, both of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. The observed morphologic changes in bovine leukocytes were leukotoxin dependent, because they were significantly diminished in the presence of an anti-leukotoxin monoclonal antibody. In addition, bovine leukocytes incubated with culture supernatant from a mutant strain of P. haemolytica that does not produce any detectable leukotoxin failed to exhibit the morphologic changes characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis. These observations may represent an important mechanism by which P. haemolytica overwhelms host defenses, contributing to the fibrinous pleuropneumonia characteristic of bovine pasteurellosis.", 
    "79": "Blood samples and vascular segments from the ischiadic artery of hens treated with either cyclic phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP; 2.5 micrograms/kg, im) or paraoxon (PXN; 0.1 micrograms/kg, im) in the presence or absence of verapamil, a calcium channel antagonist (7 micrograms/kg, im, given 4 consecutive days beginning the day before PSP or PXN administration), were examined 1, 3, 7, and 21 d after PSP or PXN administration in order to determine the contribution of catecholamines and peripheral blood vessel physiology and morphology to organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN). The levels of plasma catecholamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatograpy (HPLC) and indicated a different effect with PSP, which causes OPIDN, and PXN, which does not. PSP treatment elevated the levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine throughout the study, while PXN treatment depressed the levels of these catecholamines. Verapamil treatment attenuated the OP response by approximately 50% for both compounds. Ischiadic vessel segments were isolated from OP-treated hens and perfused at a constant flow rate of 12 ml/min, then examined for their response to potassium chloride (KCl, 3 x 10(-3) M), acetylcholine (ACh), phenylephrine (PE), an alpha 1 adrenergic agonist, and salbutamol (SAL), a beta 2 adrenergic agonist. Agents were delivered in concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-3) M. Vascular segments did not respond to ACh or SAL at any concentration used. Vessels displayed a significant reduction in contractile response to both KCl (3 x 10(-3) M) and PE (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) 3 and 21 d after exposure to either PSP or PXN. This reduced response was not altered by the presence of verapamil. Innervation of the peripheral vasculature was unchanged after OP treatment. This study indicates that plasma catecholamine levels could be differentially altered by treatment with OPs that do and do not cause OPIDN and suggests that the alterations involve intracellular calcium. In contrast, vascular response of the ischiadic artery was altered following OP treatment, but the effect was not specific for the neuropathy-inducing OP, PSP, and response was not mediated by Ca 2+, nor was it the result of autonomic nerve deterioration.", 
    "80": "We studied the occurrence of depression in new users of propranolol (n = 704), other beta-blockers (n = 587), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 976), calcium channel blockers (n = 742), and diuretics (n = 773) in the Harvard Community Health Plan population. The period of the study was from April 1988 to June 1991. All study subjects were followed for new or newly recurrent depression for up to 6 months after receiving their first study prescription. Case status was confirmed by blinded medical record review. We found 10 cases of depression that met DSM-III-R criteria (\"major depression\") and an additional 18 cases that had one or more symptoms consistent with depression (\"minor depression\"). Rates of major depression in users of beta-blockers and users of non-beta-blocker study drugs were 5.8 per 1000 person-years of exposure and 9.6 per 1000 person-years, respectively. None of the cases of major depression was propranolol associated. Rates of major or minor depression (combined) in users of beta-blockers and users of non-beta-blockers were 20.2 per 1000 person-years and 25.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The age- and sex-adjusted relative risk of major or minor depression associated with the use of beta-blockers compared to non-beta-blockers was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3-1.9). The relative risk associated with propranolol compared to non-beta-blockers was also 0.8 (95% CI, 0.1-2.7). Therefore, depression occurred no more frequently in beta-blocker users than in other members of the study base.", 
    "81": "The effect of lead exposure on beta2-adrenoceptor density and catecholamine response was studied in 26 male workers and 1 female worker, exposed to lead on average for 6 years. The systolic blood pressure in lead workers (101-160 mmHg, 124.4 +/- 14.7 mmHg) was found to be significantly higher than in controls (97-134 mmHg, 115.4 +/- 10.4 mmHg, p < 0.01) as was plasma norepinephrine (0.51 +/- 0.1 microg/liter vs 0.24 +/- 0.05 microg/liter, p < 0.01). The density of lymphocyte beta2-adrenergic receptors (Bmax) in lead-exposed workers was 86% lower than that in controls (0.15 +/- 0.08 vs 1.08 +/- 0.29 fmol/0.1 x 10(6) cells; p < 0.01). The dissociation constants (Kd) of [125I]iodocyanopindolol were 93.6 +/- 42.6 and 87.9 +/- 42.7 pM in lead-exposed workers and controls, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that elevation of systolic pressure was closely related to (a) blood lead levels, (b) decreased beta2-adrenergic receptor density, and (c) increased plasma catecholamine levels in lead-exposed workers. Linear regression analysis revealed that both plasma norepinephrine levels and beta2-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) were highly correlated with both systolic blood pressures and blood lead levels in lead-exposed workers, and a highly significant negative correlation was found to exist between Bmax and plasma norepinephrine levels (r = -0.82, p < 0.001). These data therefore demonstrate that there is a close relationship between elevated plasma catecholamine levels, decreased beta2-adrenergic receptors, and elevated blood pressure in lead-exposed workers.", 
    "82": "Both crystalloid and blood cardioplegia result in cardiac dysfunction associated with myocardial edema. This edema is partially due to the lack of myocardial contraction during cardioplegia, which stops myocardial lymph flow. As an alternative, acceptable surgical conditions have been created in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations with esmolol-induced minimal myocardial contraction. We hypothesized that minimal myocardial contraction during circulatory support using either standard cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) or a biventricular assist device would prevent myocardial edema by maintaining cardiac lymphatic function and thus prevent cardiac dysfunction.", 
    "83": "We placed 6 dogs on CPB and 6 dogs on a biventricular assist device and serially measured myocardial lymph flow rate and myocardial water content in both groups and preload recruitable stroke work only in the CPB dogs. In all dogs we minimized heart rate with esmolol for 1 hour during total circulatory support.", 
    "84": "Although myocardial lymph flow remained at baseline level during CPB and increased during biventricular assistance, myocardial water accumulation still occurred during circulatory support. However, as edema resolved rapidly after separation from circulatory support, myocardial water content was only slightly increased after CPB and biventricular assistance, and preload recruitable stroke work was normal.", 
    "85": "Our data suggest that minimal myocardial contraction during both CPB and biventricular assistance supports myocardial lymphatic function, resulting in minimal myocardial edema formation associated with normal left ventricular performance after circulatory support. The concept of minimal myocardial contraction may be a useful alternative for myocardial protection, especially in high-risk patients with compromised left ventricular function.", 
    "86": "In the present study, we studied angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptor messengers by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 healthy subjects and 50 subjects with primary hypertension, in whom angiotensin I-converting enzyme genotype was determined, before and after 15 days of treatment with different antihypertensive drugs. The medication included a calcium channel antagonist, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, and a beta 1-blocker. We also studied the relationship between AT1 receptor gene expression and biochemical parameters of the renin-angiotensin system. AT1 receptor messenger levels were positively correlated with plasma renin activity in both normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects. Increases of this messenger and plasma angiotensin II levels were correlated with the D allele in the same individuals. AT1 receptor messenger levels decreased significantly with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment in subjects with the DD genotype, and a significant decrease was observed in subjects with the II and ID genotypes treated with a calcium antagonist. No changes were observed in mRNA with the beta 1-blocker. We conclude that the AT2 receptor is not expressed in peripheral leukocytes and that AT1 receptor messenger levels vary in relation to angiotensin I-converting enzyme genotype and pharmacological treatment. These results suggest that angiotensin I-converting enzyme genotype may be an important factor when deciding on antihypertensive therapy in individuals with primary hypertension.",

    "91": "Autonomic activation mediates the majority of the increase of glucagon secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in several species including dogs, mice, and rats. However, the role of the autonomic nervous system to increase glucagon during hypoglycemia in humans remains controversial, and investigations in nonhuman primates have not been previously conducted. The autonomic contribution to glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in a nonhuman primate was examined by two independent pharmacological approaches. Glucagon responses to clamped insulin-induced hypoglycemia were compared in conscious rhesus monkeys in the presence or absence of ganglionic blockade with trimethaphan, or during combined muscarinic and adrenergic receptor blockade with atropine, propranolol, and tolazoline. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia (plasma glucose = 1.9 +/- 0.1 mmol/l) activated parasympathetic nerves to the pancreas as assessed by increased plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) levels (delta = 135.0 +/- 36.8 pmol/l, P < 0.01), produced sympathoadrenal activation as assessed by elevations of plasma epinephrine (EPI) (delta = 22.3 +/- 2.95 nmol/l, P < 0.0005) and norepinephrine (NE) (delta = 3.72 +/- 0.77 mmol/l, P < 0.0025) and increased plasma immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) (delta = 920 +/- 294 ng/l, P < 0.025). Nicotinic ganglionic blockade with trimethaphan prevented parasympathetic (deltaPP = 16.5 +/- 16.3 pmol/l, P < 0.01 vs. control) and sympathoadrenal (deltaEPI = 1.52 +/- 0.98 nmol/l; deltaNE = -0.62 +/- 0.24 mmol/l, both P < 0.0025 vs. control) activation during hypoglycemia and inhibited the IRG response by 70% (delta = 278 +/- 67 ng/l, P < 0.025 vs. control). Combined muscarinic and adrenergic receptor blockade reduced parasympathetic activation (deltaPP = 48.3 +/- 16.3 pmol/l, P < 0.01 vs. control) and inhibited the IRG response by a similar degree to ganglionic blockade (deltaIRG = 284 +/- 60 ng/l, P < 0.025 vs. control). These results demonstrate by two independent pharmacological approaches that autonomic activation makes a substantial contribution to increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia of approximately 2.0 mmol/l in a species of nonhuman primate.", 
    "92": "To examine potential interactions between leptin and the beta3 adrenergic system in the regulation of food intake, we determined the effects of treatment with a selective beta3 adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist (CL 316,243 [1 mg/kg]) on body weight, food intake, and leptin expression. Studies were carried out in C57Bl/6J and FVB male control mice as well as in mice with targeted disruption of the beta3 AR gene. These findings were correlated with measurement of the expression in hypothalamus of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), two neuropeptides that may be involved in the central regulation of food intake. Treatment with CL 316,243 (1 mg/kg) for 12 or 24 h decreased leptin mRNA abundance and circulating levels to 20% of baseline in normal animals. No effect of the CL 316,243 compound was seen in mice with targeted disruption of the beta3 AR gene. Despite the failing leptin levels, beta3 agonist administration acutely suppressed food intake. Finally, the induced suppression of food intake and leptin levels occurred despite unchanged or increased hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides NPY and MCH. Thus, beta3 AR agonists via beta3 ARs suppress leptin levels acutely and simultaneously suppress food intake via a mechanism that operates downstream of leptin and two of its putative central targets.", 
    "93": "Propranolol, a first-generation nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, is commonly used to treat pediatric arrhythmias. Atenolol, relatively long-acting, cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, has been successfully used in adults with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). There is only one report on the use of atenolol in children with SVT; and our report is on the first long-term prospective study to evaluate the use of atenolol in children. A group of 22 children < 18 years of age with clinical SVT were enrolled in the study. The tachycardia was documented on electrocardiograms in each case and was confirmed by electrophysiologic studies in some. Once-a-day oral atenolol was started as a monotherapy. Of the 22 children with various types of SVT, 13 (59%) were well controlled on long-term oral atenolol therapy. The effective dose of atenolol ranged between 0.3 and 1.3 mg/kg/day (median effective dose 0.7 mg/kg/day). Five children had some adverse effects. However, none in the successful group of 13 patients required drug discontinuation because of such effects. Once-a-day oral atenolol as a monotherapy is effective and relatively safe for long-term management of SVT during childhood. It is an attractive alternative beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent for the management of pediatric arrhythmias.", 
    "94": "We examined the effect of thrombin on phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D activity in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. Thrombin stimulated the formation of choline dose dependently in the range between 0.01 and 1 U/ml, but not the phosphocholine formation. Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)- inactivated thrombin had little effect on the choline formation. The combined effects of thrombin and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a protein kinase C-activating phorbol ester, on the choline formation were additive. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinases, had little effect on the thrombin-induced formation of choline. Combined addition of thrombin and NaF, an activator of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein, did not stimulate the formation of choline further. Pertussis toxin had little effect on the thrombin-induced formation of choline. Thrombin stimulated Ca2+ influx from extracellular space time and dose dependently. The depletion of extracellular Ca2+ by EGTA exclusively reduced the thrombin-induced choline formation. Thrombin had only a slight effect on phosphoinositide-hydrolyzing phospholipase C activity. Thrombin induced diacylglycerol formation and DNA synthesis, and increased the number of MC3T3-E1 cells, but DFP-inactivated thrombin did not. Thrombin suppressed both basal and fetal calf serum-induced alkaline phosphatase activity in these cells. Propranolol, an inhibitor of phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase, inhibited both the thrombin-induced diacylglycerol formation and DNA synthesis. These results suggest that thrombin stimulates phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D due to self-induced Ca2+ influx independently of protein kinase C activation in osteoblast-like cells and that its proliferative effect depends on phospholipase D activation.", 
    "95": "A transgenic mouse overexpressing a mutant form of calmodulin (CaM-8) that is selectively targeted to pancreatic beta-cells has an impaired ability to secrete insulin in response to elevated blood glucose. Fluorescence measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) showed that intracellular Ca2+ rises produced by glucose were smaller than normal in beta-cells of CaM-8 mice. Glucose utilization rates were not different between the CaM-8 and control beta-cells, suggesting that glucose metabolism was unperturbed by CaM-8. Ion channel defects were implicated in the phenotype of CaM-8 beta-cells because treatment of these cells with tolbutamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, produced smaller than normal amounts of insulin secretion and Ca2+ rises. Depolarization with elevated extracellular K+ also produced smaller Ca2+ rises in beta-cells from CaM-8 mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that Ca2+ channel currents of beta-cells from CaM-8 mice were half as large as Ca2+ currents in control cells, while the currents carried by delayed rectifier and ATP-sensitive K+ channels were similar in magnitude in both cell types. We conclude that expression of the CaM-8 form of calmodulin causes a down-regulation of Ca2+ channel currents, which reduces Ca2+ entry and accumulation when glucose stimulates closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels. The reduction in intracellular Ca2+ accumulation then prevents an adequate amount of insulin from being secreted from beta-cells of CaM-8 mice.", 
    "96": "A tyrosine residue at the cytoplasmic end of the seventh transmembrane helix is conserved in many G-protein-coupled receptors. In the human beta 2-adrenoceptor, this tyrosine (Tyr326) has been proposed to be a specific determinant for agonist-induced receptor sequestration. In order to probe its contribution to the sequestration process we have replaced this tyrosine by alanine (Y326A) or phenylalanine (Y326F). Wild-type and mutant receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Agonist-induced sequestration was essentially abolished in Y326A receptors and only slightly reduced in Y326F receptors. However, cells expressing Y326A receptors displayed a high percentage of internal receptors under basal conditions while cells expressing wild-type receptors did not. In addition, high-affinity agonist binding and the ability to activate adenylyl cyclase were markedly reduced in Y326A receptors and slightly reduced in Y326F receptors. We conclude that Tyr326 is required for the functional integrity of the beta 2-adrenoceptor and that it may be involved in multiple agonist-induced effects.", 
    "97": "Hemorrhage from esophageal varices is a life-threatening event in patients with liver cirrhosis. About 40% to 80% of the patients surviving the first bleeding suffer from a recurrence of variceal bleeding within one year. This high recurrence rate substantially contributes to the mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Therefore, various treatment regimens both in primary and secondary prophylaxis were studied. Most experience in medical primary prophylaxis was collected with beta-blockers, mainly propranolol. Treating patients with esophageal varices with propranolol significantly reduces the incidence of first variceal bleeding. However, the effect on mortality is marginal, and primary prophylaxis is generally not recommended in these patients. Several studies support the hypothesis, that medical prophylaxis with beta-blockers is more effective in reducing the rate of first esophageal bleeding in patients with a high risk of hemorrhage, such as the presence of very large varices with red spots. A score to assess the individual risk of a given patient to suffer a variceal bleeding would be helpful. As long as such a score is not validated, no general rule for this treatment decision can be given. In secondary prophylaxis, both administration of beta-blockers and endoscopic therapy (sclerotherapy or ligation of the varices) are effective in significantly lowering the rate of re-bleeding. However, the effect on mortality was not significant in most studies. Several studies comparing the efficacy of medical prophylaxis and endoscopic treatment showed advantages of the endoscopic therapy with a greater reduction in recurrent bleeding episodes. However, medical prophylaxis with beta-blockers has the important advantage of being immediately effective whereas endoscopic procedures provide the best protection against recurrent bleeding after complete obliteration of the varices. Therefore, in the first weeks and months of endoscopic therapy, the additional treatment with beta-blockers may further reduce the risk of re-bleeding. Only half of all studies on this topic reported a significant advantage of such a combined therapy. Therefore, it seems reasonable to restrict this approach to patients with a high risk of re-bleeding such as patients with large sclerotherapy-derived esophageal ulcers.", 
    "98": "Beta-Blockers are widely used in cardiovascular medicine. In patients with hypertension, beta-blockers show beneficial effects on clinical end points of stroke and coronary heart disease prevention and mortality. beta-blockers also are well established in improving exercise tolerance and decreasing the number and duration of anginal attacks in patients with angina pectoris. Based on evidence showing reduced mortality and morbidity, beta-blockers are the cornerstone of therapy after acute myocardial infarction. Unfortunately, presumption of poor tolerance has left these drugs underutilized in this clinical setting, despite data that indicate a wide range of tolerability. The use of beta-blockers in patients with congestive heart failure results in beneficial hemodynamic effects and symptomatic improvement. Among factors that should be considered when selecting a beta-blocker for an individual patient are demonstrated efficacy of the drug in a specific indication, tolerability, product formulation and duration of action, and the presence or absence of specific properties such as cardioselectivity.", 
    "99": "To clarify the interactions between hippocampal glutamatergic and adrenergic systems in the working memory function of rats, the effects of hippocampal NMDA receptor blockade combined with noradrenaline depletion or alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on this behavior were examined with a three-panel runway task. Intrahippocampal administration of the potent and competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) at a dose of 32 ng/side significantly increased the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panels gates at four choice points) in the working memory task, whereas the 3.2 ng/side dose of CPP did not affect working memory errors. Administration of the noradrenergic neurotoxin N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2 -bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) at 50 mg/kg i.p. produced marked reductions in hippocampal and cortical noradrenaline contents, but it had no effect on working memory errors. Intrahippocampal administration of 3.2 ng/side CPP, the behaviorally ineffective dose in intact rats, significantly increased the number of working memory errors in the noradrenaline-depleted rats. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (3.2 mg/kg i.p.) did not affect working memory errors whether administered alone or in combination with intrahippocampal CPP (3.2 ng/side). The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (10 mg/kg i.p.) also had no effect on working memory errors. However, propranolol (10 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in working memory errors when administered together with intrahippocampal CPP (3.2 ng/side). These results suggest that hippocampal NMDA/beta-adrenergic interactions are involved in neural processes mediating working memory function of rats.",

The primary outcomes were rebleeding, death, and complications. The hepatic venous pressure gradient was measured at base line and after three months.", 
    "102": "Base-line data were similar in the two groups, and the median follow-up was 18 months in both. Eleven patients in the medication group and 23 in the sclerotherapy group had rebleeding. The actuarial probability of remaining free of rebleeding was higher in the medication group for all episodes related to portal hypertension (P = 0.001) and variceal rebleeding (P = 0.002). Four patients in the medication group and nine in the sclerotherapy group died (P = 0.07 for the difference in the actuarial probability of survival). Seven patients in the medication group and 16 in the sclerotherapy group had treatment-related complications (P = 0.03). Thirty-one patients in the medication group underwent two hemodynamic studies; 1 of the 13 patients with more than a 20 percent decrease in the hepatic venous pressure gradient had rebleeding, as compared with 8 of the 18 with smaller decreases in the pressure gradient (P = 0.04) for the actuarial probability of rebleeding at two years).",

    "104": "Acupuncture is now being increasingly used in the treatment of headache. Acupuncture is a technique originating in Asia, from countries that have a cultural background with a fundamentally different concept of disease and therapy. Up to now, sustained application of acupuncture in Western medicine has been impeded by the lack of a scientifically convincing explanation of the mechanisms of action in terms of neurobiological criteria. Acupuncture is being used empirically in the treatment of migraine; clinical studies have been published. A definitive evaluation of acupuncture based on well-founded clinical experimental studies has yet to be made. The investigation was carried out in migraine patients who were divided into two subgroups in a control group design with two different stimulation techniques. The verum group was treated with the correct point location, normal prick depth and elicitation of a needle sensation. The control group received treatment at points that are far away from the acupuncture points, using a superficial prick technique and without eliciting a needle sensation. The effect of therapy was appraised by means of headache diaries with subsequent interference statistical and individual case analysis. In the present study comprising 81 patients, the incidence of the attacks was significantly reduced in both subgroups. The effect of acupuncture treatment was of comparable magnitude to that of the beta-blocker metoprolol. The advantage of acupuncture treatment consists in the lack of side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms or an increase in weight. A minor side effect was only reported in one case. In the data analysis with the interference statistical method, verum acupuncture was superior to the control in only one subgroup. The possibility that the addition of further points (distant points) can explain this effect on the basis of the hypothesis of a central modulation of the migraine process is discussed. Acupuncture shows a sufficiently pronounced and sustained therapeutic effect for its use to be considered in a possible interval treatment of migraine.", 
    "105": "These experiments examined the effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) on single-unit electrophysiological activity of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. As has been reported previously, infusion of CRH into the ventricular system of the brain (i.c.v.) of halothane-anesthetized adult male rats increased spontaneous discharge rate of LC neurons while producing no increase, and possibly a decrease, in sensory-evoked activity. However, when i.c.v. CRH was given to female rats or immature male rats, which had not been studied previously, LC activity was not altered. To attempt to understand this sex and age difference, potential mechanisms by which i.c.v. CRH elevates LC spontaneous activity in adult male rats were examined; in that i.c.v. CRH activates the pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system, these response systems were manipulated. Adrenalectomy (with or without corticosterone replacement by pellet) did not affect the ability of i.c.v. CRH to increase LC spontaneous activity in adult male animals, but blockade of sympathetically-mediated autonomic responses, either by chlorisondamine or the beta adrenergic receptor blocker timolol, blocked this increase, indicating that afferent feedback from peripheral autonomic responses was critical for activating LC neurons following i.c.v. CRH. To determine whether CRH neurotransmission might play a role in this feedback pathway, the CRH antagonist alpha-helical CRH (alpha-hCRH) was microinjected into several brain regions including LC prior to i.c.v. CRH. alpha-hCRH microinjected into LC reduced the increase in LC activity caused by i.c.v. CRH; however, blockade of this increase was total when alpha-hCRH was microinjected into the lateral parabrachial nucleus ipsilateral to the LC recording site, suggesting that increased LC activity following i.c.v. CRH is mediated by CRH acting in the parabrachial region. During these studies, it was also observed that microinjection of alpha-hCRH into LC increased LC spontaneous discharge rate; consequently, CRH was microinjected into LC, and produced a dose-dependent decrease in LC spontaneous activity in both male and female rats, which could be blocked by microinjection of alpha-hCRH - these data indicated that the direct influence of CRH on LC neurons is to decrease their spontaneous activity. To reconcile this with the original report that CRH applied to LC neurons increases their activity, one possibility suggested is that the CRH microinjection procedure used in the present study stimulated inhibitory receptors on LC dendrites whereas the original study stimulated excitatory receptors on LC cell bodies. It is concluded that an inhibitory influence of CRH on LC activity is consistent with recent data indicating that decreased LC activity increases anxiety and stress-related responses, but that direct influences of CRH appear rather minor in determining LC neuronal activity in comparison to other inputs to LC such as are seen after i.c.v. CRH infusion.", 
    "106": "In this study, we have looked in detail at the effects of aging on neurotransmission in isolated atria and intact heart in anesthetized rats, examining adult and aged animals. There was a diminished ability of the norepinephrine reuptake blocker cocaine to increase stimulation-evoked release of norepinephrine in aged rats and in terms of increasing the norepinephrine-evoked tachycardia in anesthetized rats, suggesting that the function of the reuptake process is diminished by aging. The ability of the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist xylazine to inhibit release of norepinephrine neurotransmitter was also diminished in aged rats both in isolated tissues and in vivo in anesthetized animals. In further studies, the ability of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonists isoproterenol (beta 1 and beta 2 agonist) and procaterol (selective beta 2 agonist) to increase stimulation-evoked release of norepinephrine was examined. Both agonists produced a concentration-dependent facilitation of norepinephrine release in rats atria. Although isoproterenol and procaterol increased release in tissues from young and old animals, the magnitude of the increase was significantly reduced in tissues from old rats, so that beta-adrenergic receptor mediated facilitation was diminished. In summary, aging is associated with a decline in prejunctional modulation of neurotransmission, in terms of diminished norepinephrine reuptake, diminished prejunctional alpha 2 adrenergic receptor mediated inhibition and diminished prejunctional beta 2 adrenergic receptor mediated facilitation. TABLE 2 summarizes the possible effects of aging on noradrenergic neurotransmission. Overall, neurotransmission at rest may be little changed by aging, given that postjunctional responsiveness may fall, but scope for modulation may be diminished.", 
    "107": "Although increases in serum epinephrine are known to cause hypokalemia, the epinephrine dosages and concentrations at which this effect occurs, and the electrocardiographic consequences, have not been evaluated. Because epinephrine infusion is now being used to provoke arrhythmias in some patients, we have determined the physiologic effects of a range of dosages of epinephrine. The effects of pretreatment with propranolol and diltiazem on these indexes of epinephrine effect were also evaluated. Epinephrine dose ranging started at 10 ng/kg/min, with doubling of the dose every 10 minutes until a predetermined end point was reached. At the end of each dosage level, serum electrolytes, catecholamines, and an electrocardiogram were recorded. Whereas even the lowest dosage of epinephrine significantly increased heart rate, serum glucose levels increased and serum potassium decreased only when dosages of 160 to 320 ng/kg/min were administered. Plasma concentrations of epinephrine at these dosages were mean +/- SD 1,328 +/- 902 pg/ml, comparable to those observed in these subjects during maximal exercise (1,003 +/- 527 pg/ml). The major electrocardiographic effect of epinephrine infusion was a dose-related increase in QTc, but pretreatment with propranolol blunted this effect and tended to shorten QTc. At an epinephrine dose of 40 ng/kg/min, QTc prolongation persisted and was inhibited by diltiazem. These data suggest that the major electrocardiographic effect of epinephrine infusion is mediated by increased calcium current. At dosages > 80 ng/kg/min, plasma epinephrine concentrations are comparable to those observed with severe stress, and hypokalemia is common. The use of epinephrine as an electrophysiologic provoker at dosages > 80 ng/kg/min results in both a direct effect, as well as an indirect effect due to hypokalemia.", 
    "108": "This report focuses on the subset of 235 patients from the Asymptomatic Cardiac Ischemia Pilot (ACIP) study receiving randomly assigned medical therapy to treat angina and suppress ischemia detected on ambulatory electrocardiography: 121 patients received the sequence of atenolol and nifedipine, and 114 diltiazem and isosorbide dinitrate. After 12 weeks of therapy, the primary end point (absence of ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) ischemia and no clinical events) was reached in 47% of atenolol/nifedipine- versus 31% of diltiazem/isosorbide dinitrate-treated patients (adjusted p = 0.03). A trend to increased exercise time to ST depression was seen in the atenolol and nifedipine versus diltiazem and isosorbide dinitrate regimens (median treadmill duration 5.8 vs 4.8 minutes; p = 0.04). However, when adjusted for baseline imbalances in ambulatory ECG ischemia, the 2 medical combinations were similar in suppression of ambulatory ECG ischemia. In both medication regimens, an association between mean heart rate and ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiography after 12 weeks of treatment was observed so that patients on either regimen with a mean heart rate > 80 beats/min had ischemia detectable almost twice as often as those with a mean heart rate < 70 beats/min (p < 0.001).", 
    "109": "The benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients after myocardial infarction is well established. The use of beta blockers in the high-risk subgroup of patients with combined diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) remains controversial. From a database of 14,417 patients with chronic CAD who had been screened for participation in the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study, 2,723 (19%) had non-insulin-dependent DM. Baseline characteristics and 3-year mortality were analyzed in patients with DM receiving (n = 911; 33%) and not receiving (n = 1,812; 67%) beta blockers. Total mortality during a 3-year follow-up was 7.8% in those receiving beta blockers compared with 14.0% in those who were not (a 44% reduction). A reduction in cardiac mortality of 42% between the 2 groups was also noted. Three-year survival curves showed significant differences in mortality with increasing divergence (p = 0.0001). After multiple adjustment, multivariate analysis identified beta-blocker therapy as a significant independent contributor to improved survival (relative risk = 0.58; 90% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.74). Within the diabetic population, the main benefit associated with beta-blocker therapy was observed in older patients, in those with a history of myocardial infarction, those with limited functional capacity, and those at lower risk. Thus, therapy with beta blockers appears to be associated with improved long-term survival in the high-risk subpopulation of patients with DM and CAD.", 
    "110": "The effects of diadenosine pentaphosphate (AP5A), and diadenosine hexaphosphate (AP6A) on the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were evaluated in cultured human fibroblast cells (HF cells) using the fluorescent dye technique. AP5A, and AP6A concentration-dependently increased [Ca2+]i in HF cells. The addition of 10 mumol/1 AP5A and AP6A significantly increased [Ca2+]i in HF cells from 71 +/- 3 nmol/1 (n = 184) to 241 +/- 39 nmol/1 (n = 11; P < 0.001 compared to resting value) and to 227 +/- 26 nmol/1 (n = 23; P < 0.001), respectively. The purinoceptor P2 blockers, suramin and pyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS), inhibited the diadenosine polyphophate-induced [Ca2+]i increase, whereas the P2y purinoceptor blocker, reactive blue, had no effect. Adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) and the P2x agonist, alpha 1 beta-methylene-ATP also significantly increased [Ca2+]i in HF cells, whereas the P2y agonist methylthio-ATP showed only a small [Ca2+]i response. Diadenosine polyphosphates mainly induced transplasmamembrane Ca2+ influx as was confirmed by experiments in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or by manganese quenching studies. Organic (verapamil) and inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers (NiCI2) significantly reduced the AP6A induced transplasmamembrane Ca2+ influx. The inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, D609, significantly reduced the effect of diadenosine polyphosphates on [Ca2+]i in HF cells. It is concluded that diadenosine polyphosphates regulate transplasmamembrane Ca2+ influx after occupation of P2x receptors via activation of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C and hence of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels.", 
    "111": "A sensitive and quantitative reversed-phase HPLC method for the analysis of D,L-sotalol in human atria, ventricles, blood and plasma was developed. Sotalol was determined in about 100 mg of human right atria, left ventricles, and in 500 microliters of blood and plasma samples of patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery or heart transplantation. Patients were taking 80-160 mg of sotalol as an antiarrhythmic agent. Atenolol was used as an internal standard certifying high precision of measurement. Sotalol blood and plasma concentrations correlated linearly to the obtained signals from 26.5 ng/ml to 2.12 micrograms/ml. Sotalol tissue concentrations showed linearity between 0.27 ng/mg and 10.6 ng/mg wet weight. The limit of quantitation was 0.27 ng/mg at a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. Sotalol was extracted from homogenized tissue with a buffer solution (pH9) and the remaining pellet was extracted with methanol. The methanol extract was evaporated under nitrogen and reconstituted in buffer (pH3). The whole extract was cleaned by solid-phase column extraction, eluted with methanol, evaporated again, reconstituted in the mobile phase (acetonitrile-15 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH3, 17:83, v/v) and injected onto the HPLC column (Spherisorb C6 column, 5 microns, 150 x 4.6 mm I.D.). For the detection of sotalol, the UV wavelength was set to 230 nm. Recoveries of sotalol and atenolol in atria and ventricles were 65.6 and 75.0%, respectively. Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation for tissue concentrations were 3.38 and 6.14%, respectively. Intra- and inter-assay accuracy for determined tissue sotalol concentrations were 94.9 +/- 6.3 and 99.6 +/- 4.1%.", 
    "112": "The beta-adrenoceptor activity profile of trimetoquinol and its 1-benzyl halogen-substituted analogues was studied in rat tissues containing primarily beta 1 (atria)-, beta 2 (trachea)- and atypical beta/beta 3 (distal colon and brown adipose tissue)-adrenoceptors. Functional biological activity resided in the (-)-isomer of trimetoquinol which was 112-, 275-, 372- and 513-fold more potent than (+)-trimetoquinol in trachea, right atria, distal colon and brown adipose tissue, respectively. (+/-)-Trimetoquinol was equally or slightly less active than (-)-trimetoquinol. The 1-benzyl halogen-substituted analogues of trimetoquinol exhibited differential activation of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. In functional assays, 3'-iodotrimetoquinol was a potent activator of all beta-adrenoceptor subtypes. 3',5'-Diiodotrimetoquinol was 10-fold more potent as an agonist in tissues containing atypical beta/beta 3-adrenoceptors than those tissues containing beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor sites. Furthermore, this drug was a partial agonist as compared to (+/-)-trimetoquinol and 3'-iodotrimetoquinol on beta 1-adrenoceptors. Pharmacological properties of the compounds on rat beta 3-adrenoceptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were consistent with results observed in functional assays. 3',5'-Diiodotrimetoquinol possessed the greatest potency for activation of adenylyl cyclase. Rank order of affinity for rat beta 3-adrenoceptor was 3'-iodotrimetoquinol = 3',5'-diiodotrimetoquinol > (+/-)-trimetoquinol > (-)-isoprenaline. These results suggest that 3',5'-diiodotrimetoquinol is a promising drug for further chemical modification in the development of selective beta 3-adrenoceptor ligands.", 
    "113": "The effects of exogenenous monoaminergic neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, NE; epinephrine, E; dopamine, DA and 5-HT) and inhibin alpha N-terminal fragments P32 (1-32), P32-Tyr on P4 production by incubated rat CL cells were studied. The results demonstrated that: (1) alpha fragments caused significant inhibition on P4 production. (2) 0.1 mmol/L NE (or E) and 10 mumol/L DA produced a marked increase in both basal and hCG induced P4 production by CL cells (P < 0.001). The rank orders of potency of the catecholamines in stimulating P4 production were different, for basal P4 production, NE > E > DA; but for hCG induced P4 production, DA > E > NE, i.e. the order just reversed. Addition of P32-Tyr significantly neutrolized the stimulatory action of E, but only slightly increased the action of NE. (3) alpha receptor blocker phentolamine and beta receptor blocker propranolol were effective in decreasing basal and hCG-induced P4 production, the latter being more effective than the former. It was further shown that both blockers augmented the inhibitory effect of alpha-fragments on P4 production. (4) Unlike NE, E, and DA, 5-HT at 0.5 mumol/L exerted inhibitory effect on the basal and hCG-induced P4 production, but profoundly supressed the inhibitory effect of alpha-fragments on P4 production. The above results suggested: (1) Adrenergic, DA and 5-HT receptors are present in rat CL, where catecholamine might exert a stimulating effect on basal and hCG-induced P4 production via different pathways. (2) The inhibitory effect of P32, P32-Tyr on P4 production might be related to their inhibition by partial blocking alpha/beta receptors, which were antagnized by 5-HT. (3) The action of P32, P32-TYr on P4 production is brought on the participation of neurotransmitters NE, E, DA and 5-HT.", 
    "114": "Laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation are known to increase sympathetic activity that may be detrimental to patients with pre-existing ischemic or hypertensive heart diseases. In order to alter the hyperdynamic consequences resulting from intubation during induction of general anesthesia, we chose esmolol, an ultra-short acting cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, to attenuate the cardiovascular responses during tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgery. The efficacy of esmolol in this regard was carefully evaluated.",

Monitoring included EKG, pulse oximetry, capnometry and arterial pressure. All patients were premedicated with diazepam 0.1 mg/kg 30 min before induction of general anesthesia. Each designated drug was given upon induction of anesthesia (time zero). Anesthesia was induced with thiopental 5 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg, and maintained with N2O, 1% isoflurane in 50% O2 and vecuronium. Intubation was carried out 3 min after the designated drug was given. Heart rate (HR) and systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP) were obtained every min for 10 min after induction.

    "118": "The submitted review draws attention to advantages and pitfalls of the use of betablockers in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Despite certain metabolically adverse effects which are reduced to a minimum in small doses and more recent betablockers, the latter are along with diuretics the only antihypertensive agents where unequivocally the the long-term favourable effect on the general and cardiovascular mortality was proved. In other hypertensive agents results are expected after completion of multicentric studies which are underway. Beta-blockers, as monotherapy or combined with other drugs, are the drug of choice in the treatment of essential hypertension in young hypertonic patients with hyperkinetic circulation, a tendency for tachycardia, in hypertonic patients with ischaemic heart disease after myocardial infarction or with angina pectoris. In these subjects they quite obviously reduce the general as well as cardiovascular mortality, sudden death and myocardial re-infarction. Betablockers are effective also in elderly hypertonic patients where preparations with ISA or beta 1-selective preparations are more useful. With a certain amount of care similar types of beta-blockers or beta-blockers with a dual effect can be used in hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipoproteinaemia or ischaemia of the lower extremities. Beta-blockers are irreplaceable among antihypertensives of first choice and are experiencing their revival being effective, safe, cheap and well tolerated antihypertensive drugs. Their other properties such as the degree of selectivity, the presence of internal sympathetic activity, combined dual effect, lipophilic or hydrophilic character, enable us to indicate different preparations \"tailored\" with regard to the severity of hypertension, organ complications and associated diseases.", 
    "119": "Isolated hypoaldosteronism is found in 75% diabetics where the disease has persisted for 10 or more years. Sporadically it is found in congenital autonomous neuropathy, in acute glomerulonephritis, in gouty kidney, tubulointerstitial nephritis, after transplantation of the kidney, on mytomycin etc. During dynamic testing of the response of plasma renin activity and aldosterone to the administration of furosemide and a vertical position in diabetics a significantly reduced response was recorded as compared with non-diabetic hypertonic subjects. In 18.3% no response was observed (decompensated form of IHH). Diabetic hypertonics behaved like control hypertonics on long-term beta-blocker treatment. In the decompensated form of IHH after administration of drugs interfering with the activity of SNS-RAAS activity (ACEI, spirolactone etc.) a hyperkalaemic crisis may develop which threatens the patient with acidosis, dehydration, myoplegia, muscular spasms, however, in particular with fatal disorders of the cardiac rhythm. A similar effect may be exerted also by blockers of prostaglandin synthetase (non-steroid antirheumatics) and other drugs. The cause of IHH in diabetics is the coincidence of several pathogenic factors: 1. hypersecretion of ANF with hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic hypervolaemia and hyperfiltration already at the onset of DN, 2. early development of autonomous neuropathy of the sympathetic nerve, 3. reduced renin and prostaglandin formation already in the early stages of DN, 4. reduced extrarenal isorenin formation, 5. reduced conversion of prorenin into active renin, 6. reduced reactivity of the zona glomerulosa to AII, hyperkalaemia and ACTH for its functional reconstruction as a result of periodic activation of contraregulative hormones by fluctuations of the blood sugar level in diabetic patients, 7. reduced response of the distal renal tubule to aldosterone because of tubulointerstitial changes. IHH is thus another serious but rarely diagnosed late complication of diabetes which depends only partly on the stage of DN. It must be, however, diagnosed and respected with regard to the selection of drugs for the treatment of arterial hypertension and the syndrome of insulin resistance and the 5H syndrome resp., i.e. the association of hyperinsulinism which compensates insulin resistance with hyperglycaemia (NIDDM), hypertension, hyperlipoproteinaemia and hirsutism in women (so-called Stein-Leventhal syndrome).", 
    "120": "Social phobia has been recognized as a discrete diagnostic condition only relatively recently. Epidemiological studies have shown that social phobia is associated with significant impairment and an increasing body of evidence has now indicated that pharmacological treatment is effective. Placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine. A reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, moclobemide, is better tolerated and safer than the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors and placebo-controlled studies have also demonstrated efficacy for this compound; moreover, positive results from a small study of brofaromine also support the efficacy of this class of compounds. It has been reported that a high-potency benzodiazepine, clonazepam, is effective but there is little placebo-controlled evidence to support the use of other benzodiazepines. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also being tested in social phobia with encouraging results. More studies are now needed on the long-term treatment of social phobia.", 
    "121": "All the presently available antiglaucoma medications have either local or systemic adverse effects. Combinations of drugs are being used not only to increase the effectivity and compliance but also to decrease the incidence and magnitude of side effects. The single dose response of open angle glaucoma eyes to pilocarpine 1%, clonidine 0.125%, a combination of pilocarpine 1% and clonidine 0.125%, and timolol 0.5% was studied in a double blind, masked, cross over study. Over a period of twelve hours the effectivity of the combination of pilocarpine 1% and clonidine 0.125% was significantly more than that of either drug alone and was found to be similar to that of timolol 0.5%. No local or systemic adverse effects were seen.", 
    "122": "We investigated the mechanisms of the alterations in sensitivity to catecholamines in right atria from female rats exhibiting regular 4-day estrous cycles after three foot-shock sessions at estrus, metestrus, and diestrus or at diestrus, proestrus, and estrus. Right atria from stressed rats sacrificed at diestrus showed subsensitivity to noradrenaline and adrenaline. After in vitro sympathetic denervation (38 microM 6-hydroxydopamine) plus inhibition of neuronal reuptake (0.1 microM desipramine) subsensitivity to noradrenaline was abolished, but it was again evident when extraneuronal uptake was also inhibited (10 microM phenoxybenzamine and 30 microM corticosterone). The same pretreatment abolished the subsensitivity to adrenaline. After addition of 1 microM butoxamine, a beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, the tissues from stressed rats were subsensitive to adrenaline. Right atria from stressed rats sacrificed at estrus did not show any alteration in sensitivity to catecholamines. We conclude that after foot-shock stress, right atria from female rats sacrificed at diestrus showed subsensitivity of the chronotropic response to catecholamines as a result of a conformational alteration of beta 1-adrenoceptors, simultaneously with an increase in beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated response. The mechanisms seem to be similar to those which underlie stress-induced alterations in catecholamine sensitivity in right atria from male rats. However, during estrus there are some protective factors that prevent the effects of stress on right atria.", 
    "123": "1. The optical isomers of propranolol were compared for their effects on pressor responses to adrenergic and non-adrenergic vasoconstrictors in mesenteric arterial beds of rats. 2. R(+)-propranolol (10(-7)-10(-5) M) had no effect on vessel preparations stimulated with noradrenaline, methoxamine, or arginine-vasopressin. 3. S(-)-propranolol 10(-7) M did not alter pressor responses to noradrenaline. However, S(-)-propranolol 10(-6) and 10(-5) M inhibited vasoconstriction induced by noradrenaline. This effect was similar in the presence of indomethacin 3 x 10(-6) M. 4. S(-)-propranolol 10(-5) M also inhibited vasoconstriction induced by methoxamine, shifting the dose-response curves to the right, but did not affect pressor responses to arginine-vasopressin. 5. Schild analysis for equilibrium vasoconstrictor responses to methoxamine indicated stereoselective competitive alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism by propranolol. 6. These data suggest selective inhibition of alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction by S(-)-propranolol at higher concentrations by competitive alpha-adrenoceptor antagonism.", 
    "124": "The aim of our study was to compare the effect of captopril--the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, nifedipine--the calcium antagonist, and prazosin--the alpha blocker, on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells in hypertensive patients with NIDDM and with normal glucose tolerance. The effect of a 2-week treatment with nifedipine, captopril and prazosin upon glycaemia, serum insulin (IRI) and C-peptide (CP) following oral and intravenous glucose load were investigated in three groups, each including 10 non-diabetic patients with essential hypertension (h) and 10 hypertensive type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetics (h + d), aged 32-63 years. Nifedipine produced increase in glycaemia in the oral test in both groups. In the (h) group, but not in the (h + d) group, the drug caused reduction of the glucose-dependent increases in serum IRI and CP, more marked with respect to CP, as expressed by the decrease in the molar serum CP/IRI ratio. These results indicate that in non-diabetic patients, nifedipine reduces the early response of beta-cells to glucose, but this effect is partly compensated by a decreased insulin uptake by the liver. In patients with type 2 diabetes, this phenomenon does not become manifest because of absence or reduction in the early glucose-dependent insulin release. After captopril, lower values of glycaemia and serum IRI and CP were observed in both groups suggesting an improvement of insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, nifedipine has a small influence, and captopril and prazosin are devoided of any influence on the secretory function of pancreatic beta-cells. These drugs may be recommended for the treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.", 
    "125": "This paper reviews trials of postmyocardial infarction therapies including beta adrenergic blockers, antiarrhythmic agents other than amiodarone, and thrombolytic drugs. The results of certain beta blockers on overall cardiovascular mortality and sudden death mortality after myocardial infarction are discussed, along with the results of CAST and subgroup analyses on patients at high risk for death. The effects of thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction on subsequent arrhythmic mortality are also reviewed.", 
    "126": "To study the relative contributions of medical care and changes in cardiovascular risk factors to the decline in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in The Netherlands from 1978 to 1985.", 
    "127": "The number of potential CHD deaths prevented in this period was estimated by subtracting the number of observed CHD deaths from the number of deaths that would have occurred without any change in age-specific CHD mortality. In addition, the number of myocardial infarctions over this period was determined. Using estimates of risk associated with smoking, based on national and international data, of effects of changes in total cholesterol level, of benefits of antihypertensive drug treatment and effects of different intervention strategies in subjects with a previous myocardial infarction, we calculated the relative contribution of the separate factors to the decline in CHD mortality.", 
    "128": "The estimated contribution of treatment in coronary care units, postinfarction treatment and coronary bypass grafting to the fall in CHD mortality was 46%. Approximately 44% of the decline in CHD mortality could be attributed to primary prevention efforts (cessation of smoking, change in cholesterol level and treatment of hypertension).", 
    "129": "On the basis of available estimates of the potential effects of primary and secondary prevention it seems likely that a sizeable proportion of the age-specific reduction in mortality in The Netherlands during the period 1978-85 could have resulted from these measures. However, our findings should be considered to be estimates illustrating the relative benefits of different strategies rather than absolute figures.", 
    "130": "In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of immune agents on corticosterone secretion, the present study evaluated the possible involvement of some neuronal pathways (serotoninergic, noradrenergic/adrenergic) in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced corticosterone release in male rats. Serotoninergic antagonists, mianserin (5-HT2C receptor blocker) or pindolol (5HT1A receptor blocker) or noradrenergic/adrenergic antagonists, prazosin (alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker) or propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor blocker), were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected before (5 min) the administration of LPS. In each experiment a group of rats i.p. injected with vehicle served as controls. Animals were sacrificed by decapitation 90 min after administration of LPS and trunk blood was collected for corticosterone radioimmunoassay. Results showed that pretreatment with mianserin, but not with pindolol, significantly reduced plasma corticosterone levels following administration of LPS (p < 0.05); prazosin attenuated the plasma corticosterone response to LPS (p < 0.05), while propranolol did not induce significant change. The present study indicated that serotoninergic and noradrenergic/adrenergic pathways are involved in the immunoneuroendocrine modulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal function in rats. In particular, it is probably mediated by the activation of 5-HT2C receptors and of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, while type 1A serotonin receptors or beta-adrenoceptors do not seem to be involved in such a phenomenon.", 
    "131": "1. Hypothermia alters the myocardial response to some inotropic maneuvers. By measuring developed force and effective refractory period in isolated left atrial preparations, we determined whether hypothermia affected the cardiac response to isoproterenol and propranolol. 2. Twelve experimental groups were formed, each consisting of 6 atrial preparations. Three groups maintained at either 35, 28 or 20 degrees C served to determine the effects of hypothermia alone. 3. At each temperature, 3 additional groups were exposed to 1.0 microM isoproterenol alone or in combination with either 0.3 or 10.0 microM propranolol. At 35 degrees C, isoproterenol produced an increase in developed force and decreased effective refractory period. Propranolol reversed these isoproterenol-induced effects in a concentration-dependent manner. 4. Decreasing temperature to either 28 or 20 degrees C significantly increased developed force and effective refractory period. At 28 degrees C, isoproterenol no longer produced a significant increase in developed force, although effective refractory period was still decreased. At 20 degrees C, isoproterenol significantly reduced both developed force and effective refractory period. These effects of isoproterenol were reversed by the addition of propranolol, so that the effective refractory period was increased and developed force was not different from that observed at 20 degrees C in the absence of isoproterenol. 5. These effects of isoproterenol might be explained by effects on Na+/Ca(2+)-exchange.", 
    "132": "The adaptive response to endurance exercise of the catecholamine- and glucagon-sensitive adenylyl cyclase system was studied in rat liver plasma membranes. Endurance exercise enhanced adenylyl cyclase system activation by cellular agonists (glucagon, isoproterenol), by stimulators of the enzyme catalytic subunit (forskolin, Mn2+), and by Gs-protein activators (GppNHp, fluoride). In addition, endurance exercise increased the levels of G50, Gi alpha, and G beta subunits. These results show that the adenylyl cyclase system becomes sensitized in response to physical training.", 
    "133": "We studied the effects of fluvoxamine and amitriptyline on epicardial activation delay of premature excitations, the effective refractory period, and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias by programmed electrical ventricular stimulation in the canine heart after myocardial infarction. Additionally, we investigated whether the inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake by amitriptyline contributes to epicardial activation delay or arrhythmias by combination with propranolol pretreatment. Amitriptyline, at a dose of 3 mg/kg, significantly prolonged epicardial activation delay of premature excitations in the infarcted zone in a frequency-dependent manner (n = 10). Amitriptyline also prolonged epicardial activation delay of premature excitations in the normal zone (n = 10). The effective refractory period in the infarcted zone was significantly prolonged by amitriptyline at a dose of 3 mg/kg (n = 8). Amitriptyline increased the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by programmed electrical ventricular stimulation (n = 8). Propranolol did not affect the epicardial activation delay caused by amitriptyline or the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by programmed electrical ventricular stimulation (n = 6). Fluvoxamine, on the other hand, had no significant effect on epicardial activation delay of premature excitations (n = 10) or the effective refractory period (n = 8) in both the infarcted and normal zones. Fluvoxamine did not increase the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by programmed electrical ventricular stimulation (n = 8).", 
    "134": "Secretion rates and composition of unstimulated and chewing-stimulated whole saliva and 3% citric acid stimulated parotid and submandibular-sublingual secretions were studied in 12 hypertensive patients during withdrawal of and re-exposure to antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. All the patients' blood pressures were well controlled by monotherapy with metoprolol, a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist. Blood pressure measurements and saliva sampling were performed at about 9:30 a.m., 2 h after intake of breakfast, on days 0 (medicated baseline), 7, 14, 28 (nonmedicated experimental values and nonmedicated baseline) and 35 (medicated experimental values). A significant increase in unstimulated whole saliva secretion rate was observed when metoprolol was withdrawn and a corresponding decrease when the drug was reintroduced. A positive correlation was found between diastolic blood pressure levels and chewing-stimulated whole saliva secretion rates. In unstimulated whole saliva and 3% citric acid stimulated submandibular-sublingual secretion, the output of total protein, amylase, potassium, calcium and phosphate was significantly increased during the withdrawal period and decreased when metoprolol was reintroduced. For chewing-stimulated whole saliva, the corresponding changes were restricted to output of total protein and amylase, while for citric acid stimulated parotid secretion, no changes in salivary composition were observed. Finally, in all secretions one or both of the ratios hexosamine/total protein and sialic acid/total protein were affected, indicating a possible effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on salivary protein synthesis."
