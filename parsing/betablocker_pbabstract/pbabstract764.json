    "0": "The effects of propranolol on periinfarction block, myocardial ischemic injury and left ventricular performance following anterior descending coronary artery occlusion were studied. Experiments were made in 14 dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Two minutes of reversible myocardial ischemia was induced by occlusion of descending left coronary artery. The severity of myocardial ischemia estimated by summing S-T segment elevation (sigma ST) from epicardial ECG mapping, heart rate, femoral arterial pressure and left ventricular (LV) dp/dt was determined before, during coronary occlusion alone and following propranolol infusion (0.25 mg/Kg) and coronary occlusion. Periinfarction block aspects on epicardial ECG appeared in four dogs following five repeated coronary occlusions. Propranolol infusion before coronary occlusion prevented the periinfarction block in every animal. The decrease of myocardial ischemia (sigma ST elevation), heart rate, arterial blood pressure and LV dp/dt following propranolol and coronary occlusion might be partly due to the beneficial effect of this drug on periinfarction block.", 
    "1": "Rats were treated by daily alprenolol (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg) injections for 5 days a week for 4 weeks. At 20--21 degrees C alprenolol treatment retarded the weight gain of the animals and increased the weight of the adrenals. These changes were not seen at 29 degrees C. The reduction in size and fat content of the interscapular brovin adipose tissue in drug-treated rats was independent of experimental temperature. At 20--21 degrees C prolonged beta-blockade did not cause any changes in the enzymes of the energy metabolism. At 29 degrees C, however, alprenolol treatment antagonized the decrease in activity of oxidative enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase) and the decrease in protein concentration of the cardiac muscle. In skeletal muscle alprenolol treatment significantly decreased the activities of oxidative enzymes and antagonized the rise in the activity of lactate dehydrogenase resulting from warm acclimation. The increased activities of oxidative enzymes in interscapular brown adipose tissue of aprenolol treated rats were coupled with an increase in protein concentration of the tissue. Although these changes were more marked at 29 degree C they were observable at 20--21 degree C, too. The difference in the drug effects at 20--21 degrees C and 29 degrees C can be accounted for by the compensatory catecholamine release at the lower temperature, due to impaired thermoregulatory capacity after alprenolol. Prolonged beta blockade decreased the exercise tolerance and cold tolerance of the rats. An increased response of the diastolic blood pressure to an alpha-adrenergic drug, noradrenaline, and a decreased response to a beta-adrenergic drug, isoprenaline, in alprenolol-treated rats indicates a shift from beta- to alpha-receptors.", 
    "2": "The stress of handling and taking blood samples from adult male Sprague Dawley rats every 10 minutes for 60 minutes resulted in eosinopenia within 10 minutes. The fall in eosinophils reached a nadir of 63% of the nonstressed sample by 40 minutes. This eosinopenia was mediated by way of the adrenocortical steroids as indicated by the failure of both adrenalectomized and hypophysectomized rats to react to the stress of handling and sampling with an eosinopenic response similar to the intact controls. The response was not dependent on the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by epinephrine since propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, failed to produce any diminution of the eosinopenic response.", 
    "3": "The basis of sympathetic impulse transmission are summarised. Sympathomimetics and sympatholytics are discussed with regard to their mode of action, clinical use and contra-indications. We found that a 1% solution of adrenaline twice a day together with miotics is most suitable for long-term treatment. With the beta-blockers Bupranolol and Timolol tried by us can a massive pressure reduction be obtained, but which is of short duration with the concentrations used up till now. Adrenergic potentiators can not be recommended.", 
    "4": "A propranolol-glucagon test was evaluated in 24 control normal children, 21 pituitary dwarfs, 15 patients with constitutional short stature, 2 with chromosome aberration and 4 with miscellaneous diseases. The dose of glucagon enough for the stimulation of human growth hormone (HGH) secretion is more than 20 microgram/kg of body weight. During the test in the control subjects the serum HGH level increased from 2.3 +/- 1.2 ng/ml to a maximum level of 30.0 +/- 15.1 ng/ml, when 10 mg propranolol, regardless of body weight and 30 microgram glucagon per kg of body weight are given. The dose of propranolol administered ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/kg of body weight in normal children studied. Serum 11-OHCS also increased significantly from 14.5 +/- 11.2 microgram/100 ml to 30.1 +/- 15.5 microgram/100 ml (P less than 0.01). There was no difference in the maximum level of urinary total catecholamines in propranolol-glucagon test between 7 pituitary dwarfs and 7 control subjects. The mechanism of HGH response to propranolol-glucagon administration is unknown, but propranolol-glucagon administration is a sensitive and reliable provocative test for HGH secretion, since false negative response of HGH are not observed in patients with non-pituitary disease.", 
    "5": "The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade, using oxprenolol, were studied in plasma renin activity, urinary sodium excretion and blood pressure in ten normal subjects and in 120 patients with essential and renovascular hypertension. Blood pressure was reduced by oxprenolol administration. The hypotensive action of the drug was independent of either the basal plasma renin activity or of the plasma renin activity response. Oxprenolol decreased plasma renin activity in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension with normal or high basal plasma renin activity. Patients with low plasma renin activity may show a lack of response to the beta-blockade. In patients with renovascular disease the response of plasma renin activity to oxprenolol was not a discriminant factor between patients cured or not cured by surgery. Some renovascular patients were unresponsive to beta-blockade with oxprenolol.", 
    "6": "Twenty-two patients with essential hypertension were treated for 3 months with pindolol, and blood pressure and plasma renin activity were measured at rest and after stimulation (upright posture stimulation and insulin induced hypoglycaemia stimulation). Beta-receptor blockade produced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. After treatment with pindolol the plasma renin activity was significantly lower. Under conditions of renin stimulation such as orthostasis and insulin produced hypoglycaemia, plasma renin activity was significantly lower in treated patients. There was no correlation between the fall of plasma renin activity and the decrease of blood pressure. Renin suppression is probably only one of the factors involved in the reduction in the blood pressure in these patients.", 
    "7": "Myocardial oxygen demand is a function of the product of heart rate and blood pressure. Agents such as nitroglycerin not only produce coronary vasodilatation, which increases oxygen supply, but also reduce myocardial oxygen demand secondary to a reduction in both preload and afterload. Beta-adrenergic blockers are useful in angina because they reduce myocardial work and, hence, oxygen demand. A heart rate in the 50s does not preclude an increase in the dosage of propranolol when necessary.", 
    "8": "To determine if hyperthermia in the baboon caused a reduction of renal blood flow (RBF) similar to that reported in man, we repeatedly exposed six unanesthetized male baboons (Papio cynocephalus) to ambient temperatures of 42.5-49.0 degrees C for 55-175 min. Internal temperatures rose 1.0-2.0 degrees C. On the average, RBF fell 23.7% per degrees C, renal vascular resistance (RVR) rose 34.0% per degrees C, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell by only 2.9 Torr. Plasma renin activity (PRA), measured in four baboons, rose 97.5% per degrees C. To investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin system in this renal response, we infused propranolol or saralasin (1-sar-8-ala-angiotensin II), an angiotensin II antagonist, systemically in 14 experiments on three baboons. Both propranolol and saralasin infusions prevented most of the reduction in RBF during hyperthermia. Propranolol prevented the increase in PRA. We conclude that renal vasoconstriction accompanies moderate hyperthermia in the awake baboon, and much of this response is mediated by a beta-adrenergic release of renin.", 
    "9": "1 The effect of atenolol, a cardioselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist, was studied in a double-blind crossover trial in twenty-one carefully selected hypertensive outpatients. Each patient received atenolol (50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day) and placebo according to a randomized sequence in a once-daily dose. Wash-out periods on a matching placebo were included between the treatment periods. 2 The effect of lying, standing and post-exercise blood pressure of atenolol 50 mg once-daily was not significantly different from atenolol 100 or 200 mg once-daily. The reduction in lying and standing blood pressure was approximately 23/16 and 22/18 mm Hg from levels at the end of a run-in period on matching placebo of 167/108 and 162/112 mm Hg respectively. 3 The study shows that atenolol is an effective hypotensive agent in a once-daily dose.", 
    "10": "Twenty-three survivors of out-of-hospital sudden coronary death (SCD) have been followed subsequent to initial hospitalization, cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, and ultimate coronary revascularization (11 patients) or medical treatment (12 patients). All were treated at the Milwaukee County Medical Center. History of previous myocardial infarction (10 patients) and predominance of triple coronary artery disease (20 patients) with associated ventricular dysfunction (21 patients) demonstrated advanced coronary disease in both groups. Selection for revascularization (mean, 3 grafts per patient) was not randomized, but was based on precarious coronary anatomy and was reinforced by post-SCD ventricular dysrhythmias and angina. During an average follow-up of 13 months, there were 2 perioperative surgical deaths (1 recurrent SCD) and 3 medical deaths (2 recurrent SCDs), giving a mortality rate of 22%. This is an improvement over reported post-SCD natural history and may support a policy of offering revascularization to all SCD patients who have precarious coronary anatomy.", 
    "11": "A 22-year-old Japanese male with hyperdynamic beta-adrenergic circulatr without premedication. An abnormal electrocardiographic pattern was observed during the dental treatment, which was analyzed from the standpoint of beta-adrenergic receptors and drugs. During treatment, local anesthetics without adrenergic beta-stimulant would be desirable but premedication with beta blocker may be enough even when anesthetic agents with beta-stimulators are used. Furthermore, premedication with minor tranquilizers is also effective.", 
    "12": "The effect of submaximal exercise upon haemodynamic and biochemical variables was investigated in healthy male subjects, aged 17-27 years, before and at the end of 2 weeks treatment with propranolol (40 mg p.o., q.i.d.). Propranolol reduced the resting blood pressure in normal subjects significantly. This effect was due to reduction of cardiac output and of systemic vascular resistance. No effect of propranolol on BP was seen during maximal exercise, since a reduced cardiac output was accompanied by an increased peripheral resistance. The reduction of cardiac output during exercise can be compensated in part by an increase in stroke volume. The sympathetic activity induced by physical exercise in normotensives increased plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma aldosterone (PA), and suppressed urinary excretion of c-AMP. PRC returned to basal levels after 45 min. No increase of PRC was observed after exercise in subjects treated with propranolol. Yet the increase of PA was not completely suppressed. No direct relation was demonstrated between PRC and the haemodynamic variables before or during the administration of propranolol.", 
    "13": "Tonin (an enzyme present in rat submaxillary gland and saliva) has previously been shown to be able, unlike renin and reninlike substances, to release angiotensin II either directly by acting on an appropriate substrate or from angiotensin I. The administration of a beta-adrenergic drug, isoproterenol, produces a rise of tonin concentration in saliva without affecting its concentration in the submaxillary gland. Prior administration of a beta blocker, propranolol, partially prevents this effect. The administration of theophylline increases the tonin concentration in both saliva and the submaxillary gland, whereas dibutyryl cyclic AMP increases tonin concentration in the former. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation enhances both tonin release into the saliva and tonin synthesis in the submaxillary gland, and that these effects might be mediated by cyclic AMP. Infusion of angiotensin II blocked the stimulatory effect of isoproterenol on salivary tonin. 1Sar-8Ile-angiotensin II is both a weak antagonist of angiotensin II in this respect and a strong agonist in terms of blocking the effect of isoproterenol another role mirrored in other physiological mechanisms of derivatives of angiotensin II.", 
    "14": "Diazoxide relaxed both polarized and depolarized rat uterus. The drug also conteracted the contractions elicited by Ca2+ in a competitive manner. The relaxing effect was associated with an increase in the tissue level of cyclic AMP. This metabolic effect of diazoxide was inhibited by propranolol-treatment and in preparations from reserpinized animals, while the mechanical effects were only partially reduced. Diazoxide was also found to increase the release of tritium from preparations preloaded with [3H]-noradrenaline. It is suggested that diazoxide may induce some of its mechanical and metabolic effects by releasing the adrenergic transmittor substance noradrenaline. An effect of diazoxide on the Ca2+-metabolism is also probable.", 
    "15": "The cardiac response to isoproterenol after propranolol withdrawal was studied in six normal persons. Serial isoproterenol infusions were done before and after oral propranolol administration, 160 mg daily for 2 days. Changes in electromechanical systole corrected for heart rate (QS2I) and pulse pressure were used to assess the inotropic response to isoproterenol, and changes in heart rate were used to assess the chronotropic response. As shown in previous studies, the negative inotropic effect of propranolol lasted only 12 to 15 h, while the negative chronotropic effect lasted 24 to 36 h. After the disappearance of blockade a hypersensitivity to isoproterenol was found 24 to 48 h after propranolol withdrawal in all three measured determinants. The explanation of this phenomenon most likely lies in the nature of adrenergic receptors that become activated during long-term blockade.", 
    "16": "This study was designed to investigate the possibility of a histamine mediation in muscular vasodilation induced by beta adrenoceptor stimulation. Accordingly, in seven dogs the effects of isoproterenol administration on the release of 14C-histamine from the perfused gracilis muscle were studied. Beta adrenoceptors stimulation induced a vasodilatation, as shown by a decrease in perfusion pressure(-43 +/- 12 mm Hg); simultaneously, a significant increase of the radioactivity measured in the venous blood effluent from the gracilis muscle was observed. Both these events were blocked by propranolol. In the other five dogs, chlorpheniramine was able to reduce the vasodilatation induced by the injection in the gracilis muscle of isoproterenol. Under control conditions, isoproterenol induced a fall in perfusion pressure of 44 +/- 5 mm Hg while, after chlorpheniramine, perfusion pressure decreased by only 24 +/- 4 mm Hg. The results of this study seem to confirm the possibility of a histamine mediation in isoproterenol-induced vasodilatation. However, further investigation is needed in order to identify the exact role of histamine in the geneis of this phenomenon.", 
    "17": "In order to study the mechanism by which pertussis-sensitized rats showed enhanced insulin secretory responses to various secretagogues (Sumi, T., and M. Ui, Endocrinology 97: 352, 1975), pancreases of rats receiving a single injection of Bordetella pertussis cells 3 days before were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and release of insulin therefrom was compared with that from the pancreases of normal rats. Much more insulin was released from the pancreas of the pertussis-sensitized rat than from the pancreas of the normal rat in response to glucose, arginine, glibenclamide and 3-isobuty-l-methylxanthine. The inhibition of insulin secretion caused by epinephrine, norepinephrine or phenylephrine via alpha-adrenergic receptors in the pancreas of normal rats was no longer observable with the pancreas from pertussis-sensitized rats. Instead, the addition of epinephrine with or without phentolamine gave rise to a marked secretion of insulin from the pancreas of pertussis-sensitized rats which was prevented by propranolol. It is concluded that a single injection of B. pertussis into rats results in a sustained modification of insulin secretory processes in the pancreatic beta-cells in such a manner as to favor insulin secretory responses to beta-adrenergic stimulation and other secretagogues.", 
    "18": "The efficacy and toleration of a new beta1-selective beta-blocker, H 87/07, was compared with placebo in 33 patients with angina pectoris. The efficacy was evaluated using subjective assessments of attack rate and nitroglycerin consumption as well as objective assessments of exercise tolerance on a bicycle ergometer. H 87/07 significantly reduced the attack rate and the nitroglycerin consumption compared with placebo. The mean reduction amounted to 13 and 36% respectively. No significant differences were found between H 87/07 and placebo with regard to exercise tolerance. Due to high intrinsic stimulating activity (I.S.A.) H 87/07 altered the heart rate and blood pressure only slightly at rest but during exercise significant reductions were seen. Except for one patient who had cardiac decompensation on H 87/07 no side-effects of clinical importance were seen. No significant changes were seen with regard to the laboratory tests performed.", 
    "19": "Using timed collection of blood returning via the renal veins, the renal blood flow was determined in anaesthetized dogs, following the intravenous injection of 3 beta-adrenergic blockers, namely propranolol, oxprenolol and pindolol. The test drugs were given as a bolus or as an infusion, and their effects on the renal blood flow and blood pressure were studied. All the test drugs produced diminution in both the renal blood flow and blood pressure. However, these effects were variable in degree. The diminution in the renal blood flow under the influence of beta-adrenergic blockers might be explained by concomitant reduction in the cardiac output and/or blockade of the renal vasodilator beta-adrenergic receptors. An added factor might by sympathetic stimulation with consequent renal vasoconstriction in the case of blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs should be given with extreme caution in cases with impaired renal function.", 
    "20": "Blood pressure and peripheral resistance were reduced, baroreceptor activity was enhanced after i.v. infusion of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in rabbits with intact circulation or with total cardiopulmonary bypass. The latter preparation allowed cardiac effects of the drugs to be excluded. In rabbits with an intact circulation, post-ganglionic sympathetic activity was reduced. These results suggest a direct vascular action of the drugs. The increased baroreceptor firing is not a cardiac-mediated effect and may partly induce the observed reduction in sympathetic activity.", 
    "21": "The effect of diazoxide, verapamil and compound D600 on calcium and isoproterenol dose-response relationships was investigated in isolated rabbit atrial preparations. All three agents shifted calcium dose-force relationships parallel and to the right. D600 acted as a competitive antagonist of calcium, as a plot of log (x - 1) vs. -log B resulted in a straight line with a slope of approximately -1.0. Diazoxide, verapamil and D600 also antagonized isoproterenol but in a non-competitive manner. A reduction of calcium in the bathing fluid produced a qualitatively similar non-competitive antagonism of isoproterenol and markedly potentiated diazoxide antagonism of isoproterenol. We conclude that: (1) diazoxide has calcium antagonistic properties similar to the \"calcium antagonists\" verapamil and D600; (2) these agents act as competitive antagonists of calcium through a specific site that is beyond the beta-adrenergic receptor and in the series of events between the beta-adrenergic receptors and inotropic response in myocardial tissue.", 
    "22": "Changes in urinary volume and electrolyte excretion were monitored after the injection of cholinergic and monoaminergic drugs into the third cerebral ventricle of conscious male rats made diuretic by an intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose. A natriuretic and kaliuretic response was induced by the intraventricular injection of norephrine (NE) or carbachol, whereas dopamine (DA) had no effect. The beta-receptor stimulator isoproterenol (ISO) induced an antinatriuretic and antikaliuretic effect. Intraventricular injection of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine abolished the natriuretic response to NE and carbachol and to intraventricular hypertonic saline (HS). By contrast, the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol induced a natriuresis and kaliuresis when injected alone and an additive effect when its injection was followed by NE or HS. Propranolol potentiated the natriuretic response to carbachol. Cholinergic blockade with atropine diminished the response to NE and blocked the natriuretic response to HS. It is suggested that sodium receptors in the ventricular wall can modify renal sodium excretion via a stimulatory pathway involving cholinergic and alpha-adrenergic receptors and can inhibit sodium excretion via a tonically active beta-receptor pathway.", 
    "23": "The norepinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase system in the rat brain was examined. Adrenergic blocking agents and the relative activity of structurally related catecholamines were employed to determine whether norepinephrine-stimulated accumulation of [3H]c-AMP in the hypothalamus occurred via alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. The results indicate that norepinephrine probably acts through a mixture of alpha and beta receptors in that both alpha and beta adrenergic blockers inhibited norepinephrine-induced accumulation of [3H]c-AMP. Morphine and levorphanol had no significant effect on adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase activities in hypothalamic slices or homogenates of several brain regions.", 
    "24": "The positive inotropic and chronotropic responses of guinea-pig isolated left and right atria to 17 sympathomimetic amines were examined under conditions selected to control the pharmacological environment. Each agonist was compared with (--)-isoprenaline as the reference by constructing dose-response curves. Equiactive molar concentration ratios relative to (--)-isoprenaline were calculated at the EC50 for rate and tension responses. Statistical analysis revealed that (--)-noradrenaline and (+/-)-alpha-methylnoradrenaline were tension selective whereas (+/-)-alpha-ethylisoprenaline and N-methyldopamine were rate selective relative to (--)-isoprenaline. However, no structural trends emerged. The rank order of potency varied slightly between rate and tension, but an analysis of the regression and correlation coefficients indicated respectively that the equiactive molar concentration ratios and the rank orders could be considered identical on rate and tension. Antagonism of the (--)-isoprenaline-induced rate and tension responses by acebutolol, atenolol, practolol and propranolol was assessed from the pA2 values which were almost identical for both parameters with each antagnosti. It is concluded that the beta1-adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic and chronotropic responses do not warrant subdivision into two separate groups.", 
    "25": "The synthesis of a series of 1-(acylaminomethyl-, ureidomethyl-, and ureidoethylphenoxy)-3-amino-2-propanols is described. The compounds were screened as beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists in cats and their partial agonist activity was evaluated in rats depleted of circulating catecholamines. Some of the compounds have a pharmacological profile similar to atenolol. Their structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "26": "Isolated rat tracheal smooth muscle became considerably less sensitive to the relaxing action of isoproterenol after being incubated with 5 x 10(-6) M isoproterenol for 30 minutes. Pretreatment of the tissue with propranolol, but not with methylprednisolone, clearly reduced the isoproterenol-induced desensitization. This suggested that propranolol by occupying the beta adrenergic receptor prevented isoproterenol from binding to this receptor, thereby preventing the isoproterenol-induced desensitization. Furthermore, an isoproterenol-desensitized tracheal preparation exhibited a diminished sensitivity to other beta agonists, but not to the spasmolytic actions of D600, hydralazine, sodium nitrite and aminophylline. These results suggested that the beta receptor is specifically involved in the desensitization induced by isoproterenol. A highly desensitized tissue could always be made to undergo complete relaxation by exposing it to sufficiently high concentrations of isoproterenol. Thus, there appeared to be no positive indication of a very large change in the apparent intrinsic activity of the isoproterenol in the desensitized tissue. However, the dissociation constant for the propranolol-beta receptor complex in the desensitized tissue was shown to be 180-fold larger than that in the normal tissue. These findings provide strong evidence that one demonstrable cellular change that occurs in the desensitized tissue is a pronounced reduction in the affinity of the beta receptors for isoproterenol.", 
    "27": "The erythropoietic effect of various thyroid hormones has been studied using erythroid colony formation by canine marrow cells. Although erythropoietin was required for colony growth, physiologic levels of thyroid hormones significantly enhanced colony numbers. The order of potency of the thyroid compounds in their in vitro erythropoietic effect parallels their known calorigenic potency in vivo, suggesting that the in vitro effect is physiologically relevant. A series of studies linked the mechanism of thyroid action to adrenergic receptors on responsive cells. Propranolol, a global beta-blocker, inhibited thyroid hormone-responsive erythroid colonies. When adrenergic antagonists having different blocking characteristics were added to culture, the thyroid hormone effect was blocked by those compounds having beta(2)-subspecificity. Velocity sedimentation analysis showed that the peak of colony-forming cells which respond to thyroid hormone and the adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, sedimented at an identical rate (7.54 mm/h), which is slower than the major peak of colony-forming cells responding to erythropoietin alone (8.62 mm/h). These results demonstrate thyroid hormonal enhancement of in vitro erythroid colony growth which appears mediated by a receptor with beta(2)-adrenergic properties. The data suggest that changes in hormone-target cell interaction may occur during states of abnormal thyroid function.", 
    "28": "As a result of effective beta adrenergic blockade with either propranolol or practolol, plasma renin activity was suppressed in all of 11 patients with cirrhosis and ascites. In contrast, the effect on the rate of renal excretion of aldosterone was variable, suggesting that factors other than the renin-angiotension system are responsible for the control of aldosterone secretion in cirrhosis. The changes in aldosterone could not be explained on the basis of changes in the plasma concentrations of potassium or sodium. The renal sodium excretion was inversely related to the values for aldosterone both before and after beta adrenergic blockade, indicating a major role for aldosterone in regulating sodium excretion. A number of patients had an abnormal intrarenal distribution of plasma flow with a relative hypoperfusion of the renin-secreting outer cortical nephrons. Plasma renin activity was inversely related to outer cortical plasma flow, suggesting that the reduced outer cortical flow may be a stimulus to increased renin secretion. Because the abnormal intrarenal hemodynamic pattern was not corrected by suppression of plasma renin activity, and presumably angiotension II concentrations, it is unlikely that it is attributable to the known renal vasonconstrictor effects of angiotensin II.", 
    "29": "Propranolol, pilocarpine, and placebo were tested on eight patients with ocular hypertension. The trial was performed in a randomized double-masked cross-over manner utilizing the double dummy technique. After 1 week's treatment with 40 mg propranolol administered orally twice daily a statistically significant decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) was seen. Also after application of 2% pilocarpine eyedrops three times a day IOP was significantly reduced. Propranolol decreased the IOP to about the same extent as pilocarpine. Simultaneous administration of propranolol and pilocarpine caused a further decrease in IOP which was statistically significant compared with the corresponding values during administration of pilocarpine alone. The combination of pilocarpine and propranolol lowered IOP slightly more than propranolol alone. The difference was not, however, statistically significant. During treatment with propranolol a significant decrease in heart rate was observed and a slight reduction of systemic blood pressure. It is concluded that propranolol can additively decrease IOP during treatment with pilocarpine.", 
    "30": "This paper reports the findings of an open evaluation of 100 patients treated with prazosin. When prazosin was added to existing hypotensive regimens in 50 patients whose blood pressure was poorly controlled, 36 (72 percent) became normotensive. Treatment was initiated with prazosin in a further 50 patients. Satisfactory control was achieved with prazosin alone in 24 and 20 of these became normotensive. The remaining 26 patients received in addition a beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent together with a thiazide diuretic in 14. While prazosin alone caused a mean fall of 26/14mmHg in this group, the enchanced efficacy of combined therapy achieved a normal blood pressure in 19 (73 percent) and a total mean fall in pressure of 42/28mmHg. The most frequent side effect was dizziness or faintness at the start of therapy or, less often, when the dose was increased. This is minimised by using a low initial dose of 0.5mg two or three times daily. Prazosin is an effective hypotensive agent, used alone or in combination, in most patients with hypertension of all degrees of severity.", 
    "31": "We have recently managed two patients with sclerosing peritonitis who had undergone a course of practolol but had ceased taking it some months prior to presentation. Publication of these cases will help to assess the extent of this complication and will increase awareness amongst surgeons who may be called upon to treat such cases.", 
    "32": "Propranolol contributed usefully to the practical management of patients with chronic schizophrenia whose florid symptoms had not remitted with major tranquillisers. 14 patients who had received an average equivalent of 954 mg per day of chlorpromazine for 10 years were given, in addition, either propranolol or a placebo for 12 weeks. Both groups had improved by the twelfth week, but the propranolol group had improved significantly more.", 
    "33": "Six patients with permanent hypertension with renal artery stenosis were treated by conservative reparative surgery appart from one of them (unilateral nephrectomy) and were all seen again at the 8th month at the earliest in the absence of any anti-hypertensive therapy. Study of the renin-angiotensin system carried out on a normal sodium diet, after stopping all anti-hypertensive treatment for at least 15 days, was combined with the anti-hypertensive response under the influence of a beta-blocker. There were two types of response pre-operatively: firstly, with beta-blockers alone a normal blood pressure which remained normal postoperatively; the second group of patients remained hypertensive, requiring the addition of diuretics, and remained hypertensive after surgery. This response, although non-specific, would appear to represent an important element in assessing the curability of reno-vascular hypertension.", 
    "34": "Labetalol (5-1 hydroxy-2 (1-methyl-3 phenyl amino salicylamide hydrochloride)) is a new antihypertensive agent having partial alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking properties. Nine patients with mild, moderate or severe hypertension have been given this drug over periods ranging from 6-29 weeks. Labetalol was given as replacement for a beta-blocking drug providing less than satisfactory control. Adequate control of blood pressure was achieved in all nine patients. The only side-effect of note was postural hypotension which necessitated withdrawal of the drug in one patient.", 
    "35": "Minoxidil in combination with propranolol and diuretics controlled the blood-pressure in a group of hypertensive patients who were resistant to treatment with large doses of standard drugs. The main problem was fluid retention but subjective side-effects were fewer than in a comparable group on other drugs.", 
    "36": "Several aspects of beta-adrenoreceptor blockade in man can be investigated in healthy volunteers. Beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity was investigated by measuring the influence on isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and on tachycardia due to exercise on the cycle ergometer. In these experiments pindolol was found to be 20 to 40 times more potent than propranolol. The partial agonist activity of pindolol is responsible for its small influence on heart rate under resting conditions, but probably also for its smaller effect on bronchial tone when compared with propranolol. A comparison of the duration of action of different drugs can be made by studying the effects on exercise-induced tachycardia. Two hours after oral administration, 5 mg of pindolol and 100 mg of propranolol were about equally active. The duration of action of pindolol, however, was clearly longer than that of propranolol. This should allow a single daily dose to be given to most patients for the treatment of hypertension. A comparison of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity after oral and intravenous administration provides information on the bioavailability of these drugs. In studies with pindolol the activities measured 2 hours after oral and 75 minutes after intravenous administration were about equal. This is in good agreement with the results of pharmacokinetic studies, which show almost complete absorption and a small first-pass effect of pindolol.", 
    "37": "Metoprolol and acebutolol, two supposedly cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, were tested in 11 healthy men against propranolol, a non-selective drug, for their effect on plasma free fatty acid concentrations before and after insulin. The fasting concentrations of free fatty acid were significantly reduced after acebutolol and propranolol, and their return to normal after insulin was delayed. Metoprolol had no significant effect on free fatty acid levels either before or after insulin. Although both selective and non-selective beta-blocking drugs should be expected to delay the return of free fatty acid values to normal after insulin, in contrast to propranolol and acebutolol, metoprolol had no such effect. This suggests that metoprolol may not be as effective as the other two drugs in controlling lipid metabolism during long-term treatment with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "38": "Among 71 patients treated with practolol by general practitioners, eye complaints were recorded in the case-notes of 14 (20%) during treatment, compared with 4 (6%) during equal periods before the drug was prescribed. Half the patients with eye complaints also had a rash while receiving practolol. These findings, which were not due to greater numbers of attendances during treatment nor to awareness of the hazards of the drug, suggest that mild eye complaints were relatively common among patients treated with practolol. Among 246 patients treated with propranolol, the numbers with eye complaints before and during treatment were similar, although there was a significant excess of patients with both an eye complaint and a rash during treatment.", 
    "39": "Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of propranolol administration in rats lesioned in the hippocampal area. Chronic oral administration of propranolol to intact rats produced a significant decrease in mean systolic blood pressure. No significant changes in blood pressure were produced with propranolol treatment in rats lesioned in the septal or anterior hypothalamic areas, whereas, in rats lesioned in the hippocampal area, a significant elevation of blood pressure was observed. These findings confirm previous results that suggest that the hypotensive effects observed with chronic propranolol administration are mediated via the hippocampus.", 
    "40": "The object of study were rabbits who had been subjected to ligation of 3 or 4 large branches of the left descending coronary artery 14-20 days before the experiment. In experiments with surgical desympathization of the heart it was established that the inotropic effect of cardiac glycosides did not depend on the concentration of catecholamines in the myocardium. In stimulation of adrenergic structures of the posterior hypothalamus attended with an increase in sympathetic innervation of the cardiovascular system the cardiotoxic threshold of cardiac glycosides was considerably reduced. Propranolol (Inderal) administered in a dose which blocks the beta-adrenergic apparatus of the heart prevents the development of the positive inotropic effect of therapeutic doses of strophanthin K on a hypodynamic left ventricular myocardium.", 
    "41": "Investigations on dogs of different age have brought evidence that intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg of obsidan (propranolol hydrochloride) causes in 18-22-day old puppies a fall of arterial pressure due to a reduced cardiac ejection with little changing total vascular peripheral resistance. The frequency of the rhythm and conduction in the heart are slowed down. In dogs aged 3-5 years the arterial pressure remains unchanged, since the diminution of the cardiac output is attended by a greater vascular resistance.", 
    "42": "Single unit activity was recorded by means of five-barrel micropipettes from temperature-sensitive neurons in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata in urethanized cats. Acetylcholine (ACh), norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were applied microiontophoretically to the immediate vicinity of the neurons. Both thermally sensitive and insensitive units responded to ACh (82.0%) and 5-HT (93.0%) by increasing discharge rate. Iontophoretically applied atropine, but not hexamethonium, antagonized the excitatory responses to ACh. NE was shown to have different effects on the medullary neurons. Most temperature-insensitive units were either nonresponsive (52.4%) or excited (28.6%) by NE, while a majority of warm-sensitive (61.8%) and cold-sensitive (55.6%) neurons were inhibited by NE. Iontophoretically application of the alpha-adrenergic blocking agent, phentolamine, or the beta-antagonists, propranolol, or sotalol, produced no effect on the inhibitory responses to NE. These results tend to support the current concept of the transmitter role of monoamines in thermoregulation.", 
    "43": "Constantly coupled ventricular bigeminy in dogs can be elicited by intravenous boluses of thiamylal sodium. Properties of the bigeminal rhythm are similar to those produced by halothane or cyclopropane inhalation anesthetic-epinephrine-induced dysrhythmias. The mechanism responsible for the initiation of ventricular bigeminy, and perhaps most dysrhythmias in the dog during thiobarbiturate anesthesia, appears to be an imbalance between parasympathetic and sympathetic efferent activity. Moderate increases in arterial blood pressure and atrial rate augment the tendency for dysrhythmia production. Atropine was effective in abolishing ventricular bigeminy in most cases through overdrive suppression. Propranolol appeared to abolish ventricular bigeminal rhythms by suppression of sympathetic efferent activity without causing noticeable changes in arterial blood pressure.", 
    "44": "1. The automaticity of the A-V junction was evaluated in 15 awake dogs with experimentally induced A-V junctional rhythm. 2. The spontaneous heart rate of these dogs ranged from 54 to 112 beats a minute, showing about 1.5-2.5 times slower than that of control dogs with sinus rhythm. The duration of asystole after overdrive in these dogs prolonged significantly in accordance with an increase in the frequency of stimulation for overdrive, and its mean +/- SD attained 4.7 +/- 1.1 seconds after overdrive at a rate of 2.5 times the spontaneous heart rate. 3. By administration of atropine (0.04 mg/kg, i.v.) to 8 dogs, the duration of asystole after overdrive, at a rate of 1.5 times the spontaneous heart rate, decreased from 2.6 +/- 0.8 to 1.5 +/- 0.4 seconds. By administration of practolol (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) to 7 other dogs, the duration of asystole after overdrive increased from 3.0 +/- 1.1 to 6.4 +/- 2.2 seconds. 4. It should be suggested that, (1) about 5 seconds of asystole might physiologically occur before the initiation of the A-V junctional escape beat during the long-standing sinus arrest, and (2) the sympathetic nerve might play a more important role in regulating the automaticity of the A-V junction than the vagus nerve.", 
    "45": "Repeated vital capacity (VC) breaths in 17 anesthetized and curarized dogs induced a small but significant increase in residual volume (RV). This trapping was greatly enhanced when a mixture of 80% N2O and 20% O2 (N2O-O2) was used instead of air. VC breaths with N2O-O2 also increased closing volume, closing capacity and closing pressure determined with 133Xe. Successive quasi-static pressure volume (PV) curves of the lung showed a shift to the right at high lung volume and to the left at low lung volume. Again these changes were more impressive with N2O-O2). The PV curve of the chest wall was unchanged. Insufflations from RV were necessary to produce the gas trapping. Increase in RV was positively related to the size of the inspired volume, to N2O concentration, and inversely related to the inspiratory flow rate. Vagotomy, intravenous isoproterenol, and intravenous propanolol did not alter the phenomena. We propose that these observations can be explained by the presence of foam in the airways and that N2O leads to an increase of foam by osmotic liquid shift into the bronchioli, and/or to an increase in bubble's size by gas diffusion.", 
    "46": "The activity of pineal N-acetyltransferase in the neonatal rat does not exhibit the large daily rhythm seen in the adult and is intermediate between the low day and high night adult values. These intermediate values appear to result from adrenergic stimulation. Blockade of adrenergic receptors or of catecholamine synthesis results in a decrease in enzyme activity in vivo. In vitro studies provide additional evidence of a completely developed postsynaptic adrenergic control system for pineal N-acetyltransferase activity at birth. Our observations indicate that the appearance of a circadian rhythm in pineal N-acetyltransferase at the end of the first week of life reflects the development of presynaptic mechanisms and structures necessary for the control of catecholamine release and uptake. These events follow the developmental appearance of the postsynaptic mechanisms required to mediate the adrenergic-cycle AMP regulation of pineal N-acetyltransferase activity, which can be detected prior to birth."
