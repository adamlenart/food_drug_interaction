Over a range from 0.03 to 0.3%, pluronic F68 increased apical-to-basolateral permeability (AP-BL) and decreased basolateral-to-apical permeability (BL-AP) of the P-gp substrate CEL in Caco-2 cell monolayer with the efflux ratio values of 2.8+/-0.3 (0.03%), 2.6+/-0.3 (0.1%), 2.3+/-0.2 (0.3%), respectively. CEL transport across the intestinal mucosa in the everted gut sac model was also enhanced by the P-gp inhibitor verapamil and the pharmaceutical excipient pluronic F68. Furthermore, CYP3A4-catalyzed formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam was inhibited by pluronic F68 with IC(50) and K(i) values of 0.11 and 0.16 mg/ml, respectively. The results indicate that pluronic F68 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of both P-gp and CYP3A4, suggesting a potential for pluronic F68 to modify the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs that are P-gp and/or CYP3A4 substrates in vivo.",

Atenolol (10(-4) M) accelerated the growth of neurites in spinal ganglia by 45%, while metoprolol inhibited the growth of the explants almost in all examined concentrations (10(-10)-10(-4) M). Thus, beta1-adrenoblockers can produce opposite effects on neurite growth. Both atenolol and metoprolol abolished the neurite-stimulating effect of norepinephrine, probably, because this effect is mediated via beta1-adrenoreceptors of spinal ganglia.",

Progression from partial to advanced IAB has been shown to be altered by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers. We previously reported that advanced IAB, denoted by biphasic P waves in leads II, II and aVF, can revert intermittently to its partial counterpart. However, potential factors that could induce such resolution remain unknown. We present the first known case of resolution of advanced IAB to partial IAB occurring during graded exercise, following treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocker.

    "17": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a frequently neglected co-morbidity in patients with heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of COPD in patients hospitalized for HF. Consecutive patients (n=799) admitted for a first episode of HF in all healthcare establishments of the Somme department (France) during 2000 were prospectively enrolled. Baseline characteristics and long-term prognosis were compared according to COPD status. COPD was diagnosed in 156 patients (19.5%). Compared with the no-COPD group, patients with COPD were predominantly men, more often smokers, and had lower discharge prescription rates of beta blockers (6% vs 27%, p<0.001). Five-year survival rate in patients with COPD was significantly lower than that of the no-COPD group (31% vs 42%, p=0.03). Compared with the expected survival of the age- and gender-matched general population, the 5-year survival rate in patients with COPD was dramatically lower (31% vs 71%). On multivariable analysis, COPD was a strong predictor of poorer outcome (hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.94, p<0.001). COPD was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and in patients with reduced ejection fraction. In conclusion, patients with HF and associated COPD have a poor prognosis with an impressive excess mortality compared to HF patients without COPD and the general population. Beta-blocker prescription rates remain deceptively low in this category of patients with HF.",

We show that propranolol, given in conjunction with a memory reactivation session, can specifically disrupt the conditioned reinforcing properties of a previously appetitively reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS), whether the stimulus had been associated with self-administered cocaine or with sucrose. These data show that memories for both drug and nondrug CS-US associations are dependent on beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling for their reconsolidation, with implications for the potential development of a novel treatment for drug addiction and some forms of obesity.",

In contrast, amlodipine +/- perindopril in comparison with atenolol +/- thiazide treatment (hazard ratio 0.66 [95% CI 0.59-0.74]), high HDL cholesterol, alcohol use, and age >55 years were found to be significantly protective factors. FPG was the most powerful predictor with risk increasing by 5.8 times (95% CI 5.23-6.43) for each millimole per liter rise >5 mmol/l. The risk of NOD increased steadily with increasing quartile of risk score, with a 19-fold increase (95% CI 14.3-25.4) among those in the highest compared with those in the lowest quartile. The model showed excellent internal validity and discriminative ability.",

A retrospective analysis of our in-house cardiothoracic surgical database was performed to identify patients undergoing non-emergency, elective surgical revascularisation discharged on four secondary preventive medications: aspirin; beta-blockers; ACE-inhibitors and statins. Of 2749 patients studied, 2302 underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mean age 65.5 years (S.D. 9.15). Overall, 2536 (92%) patients were prescribed aspirin. Beta-blockers were prescribed in 2171 (79%) patients overall, in 1096/1360 (81%) of patients with a history of myocardial infarction and in 465/619 (75%) of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD). Overall, 1518 (55%) patients were prescribed an ACE-inhibitor and 179 (6.5%) an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); one of these agents was prescribed in 446/619 (72%) patients with LVSD and 915/1360 (67%) patients with a history of previous myocardial infarction. Overall, 2518 (92%) patients were prescribed a statin. Secondary preventive therapies are prescribed more commonly on discharge after CABG than in previous studies, but there is a continuing under-utilisation of ACE-inhibitors. To maximise the potential benefits of these agents, further study is required to understand why they are not prescribed.", 
    "28": "Hypertension is highly prevalent in older persons and most often presents as isolated systolic hypertension. Systolic blood pressure (BP) is a stronger predictor of risk than diastolic BP in persons older than 50 years. Most of these patients will require multiple drug therapies to achieve the substantial reductions in systolic BP needed to reach target levels. Clinical trials have demonstrated that antihypertensive therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics as well as with calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers reduces cardiovascular risk in older patients. Studies examining safety and BP-lowering efficacy have shown that a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker plus a calcium channel blocker as well as a combination of diuretics and beta-blockers or diuretics plus an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker achieves greater BP reductions than monotherapy. Such multiple drug regimens are well tolerated in older patients.", 
    "29": "The recognition of a continuous relationship between elevated blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular risk has influenced national and international guidelines for the classification, prevention, and management of hypertension. The most recent report (2003) of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure uses BP thresholds to define categories of normal, prehypertension, and hypertension. A new definition proposed by the Hypertension Writing Group in 2005 offers an approach to diagnosis and management based on global or total risk. Thus, even in the absence of sustained elevations in BP, patients may have a moderate to high risk of vascular events due to the presence of additional cardiovascular risk factors, disease markers, and target organ damage. The 2007 European guidelines continue to classify hypertension based on cutoffs while also placing emphasis on multivariate formulations for cardiovascular risk assessment and goals of therapy. All 3 sets of guidelines acknowledge the necessity of using > or =2 antihypertensive agents to attain BP goals in many patients.", 
    "30": "To investigate whether lithium carbonate, propranolol or chloroquine aggravate psoriasis through influencing cytokines of the psoriatic cytokine network, HaCaT keratinocytes were stimulated with TNF-a after treatment with these drugs. Protein secretion of a set of multiple different cytokines and growth factors in culture supernatants were measured by using a cytokine antibody array technology. Expression of IL-8 and IL-6 mRNA was determined by real-time PCR. In culture supernatants of TNF-alpha-stimulated HaCaT cells, production of IL-6 and TNF-alpha could be enhanced by lithium carbonate; production of IL-6 and a panel of cytokines and growth factors could be enhanced by propranolol hydrochloride; and IL-6 was up-regulated by chloroquine diphosphate as well. Real-time PCR analysis showed a significantly dose-dependent increase of IL-8 and IL-6 mRNA expression in HaCaT cells stimulated with TNF-a as compared to cells without TNF-alpha-stimulation, the mRNA expression of IL-8 was higher than that of IL-6 with the same concentration of TNF-alpha (P < 0.01). Compared with HaCaT cells cultured with medium alone, propranolol hydrochloride at the concentration of 1 x 10(-6) mol x L(-1) could stimulate HaCaT cells to express higher level of IL-6 mRNA (P < 0.05). The drugs investigated show a modulatory effect on certain cytokines and growth factors which are able to modulate inflammatory type of immune reaction present in psoriatic lesions.",

    "35": "In the analysis of observational data, the argument is sometimes made that if adjustment for measured confounders induces little change in the treatment-outcome association, then there is less concern about the extent to which the association is driven by unmeasured confounding. We quantify this reasoning using Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) for unmeasured confounding. Using hierarchical models, the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is modeled as arising from the same distribution as that of measured confounders. Our objective is to investigate the performance of the method compared to sensitivity analysis, which assumes that there is no relationship between measured and unmeasured confounders.",

    "39": "Diabetes mellitus and heart failure are common comorbidities, and their prevalence has increased significantly over the past decade. We examined the relationships between diabetes and heart failure, the effect of commonly prescribed antidiabetic drugs on the development of heart failure, and the benefits and risks of recommended heart failure therapies in patients with diabetes. Compared with patients with heart failure who do not have diabetes, patients with both diabetes and heart failure have a poorer prognosis, including a 1.5-2-fold higher risk of mortality. Based on the results of randomized controlled trials, insulin and sulfonylureas do not appear to protect against or contribute to the development of new-onset heart failure, whereas metformin may modestly reduce the risk. The use of metformin in patients with established heart failure is controversial; retrospective analyses have shown that metformin may have a beneficial effect on outcomes, but there are no prospective, randomized clinical trials to support its use in this population. The thiazolidinediones, however, contribute to the development of heart failure and increase the risk of heart failure exacerbations particularly when used in combination with insulin. Recommendations for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure in patients with diabetes have been largely derived from post hoc analyses or preplanned subgroup analyses in landmark clinical trials. The data clearly support the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers for both the prevention and treatment of symptomatic heart failure in patients with diabetes. Despite concerns regarding the potential risks of beta-blockers in patients with diabetes, these drugs have a clear mortality benefit in patients with stages B and C heart failure. Therefore, patients with diabetes should not be denied beta-blocker therapy unless there is a clear contraindication. Likewise, aldosterone receptor antagonists should be added to standard therapies in patients with stages C and D heart failure. Future heart failure studies should include a sufficiently large diabetes cohort to conduct meaningful preplanned subgroup analyses that examine the effect of proposed treatments on both heart failure-related and diabetes-related outcomes.", 
    "40": "Starting out from a brief description of the determinants of coronary blood flow (perfusion, pressure, extravascular compression, autoregulation, metabolic regulation, endothelium-mediated regulation and neurohumoral regulation) the present review highlights the overwhelming importance of metabolic regulation such that coronary blood flow is increased at increased heart rate under physiological circumstances and the overwhelming importance of extravascular compression such that coronary blood flow is decreased at increased heart rate through reduction of diastolic duration in the presence of severe coronary stenoses. The review goes on to characterize the role of heart rate in the redistribution of regional myocardial blood flow between a normal coronary vascular tree with preserved autoregulation and a poststenotic vasculature with exhausted coronary reserve. When flow is normalized by heart rate, there is a consistent close relationship of regional myocardial blood flow and contractile function for each single cardiac cycle no matter whether or not there is a coronary stenosis and what the actual blood flow is. beta-Blockade improves both flow and function along this relationship. When the heart rate reduction associated with beta-blockade is prevented by pacing, alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction is unmasked and both flow and function are deteriorated. Selective heart rate reduction, however, improves both flow and function without any residual negative effect such as unmasked alpha-adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction or negative inotropic action.", 
    "41": "We retrospectively evaluated perfusion defect presence, extent, and severity in 158 consecutive patients receiving beta blockers, who underwent adenosine single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and coronary angiography. Seventy-six patients (group 1) had their beta blockers withdrawn 48 hours prior to testing, and 82 patients (group 2) remained on the beta blocker regimen. Groups 1 and 2 were similar in gender, age, pretest symptoms, and history of coronary artery disease (CAD). Group 1 patients had higher resting heart rates (79 +/- 19/min versus 68 +/- 13/min; P < 0.001), peak heart rates (91 +/- 21/min versus 80 +/- 15/min; P < 0.001), resting diastolic blood pressures (82 +/- 14 mm Hg versus 74 +/- 13 mm Hg; P < 0.001), peak systolic blood pressures (139 +/- 23 mm Hg versus 124 +/- 23 mm Hg; P < 0.001), and peak diastolic blood pressures (72 +/- 12 mm Hg versus 68 +/- 11 mm Hg; P = 0.04) than group 2 patients. Group 1 also had a higher incidence of angina during the 48 hours off beta blockers than group 2 (10% versus 2%; P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two groups in symptoms and side effects during adenosine infusion, quantitated lung/heart ratio, visually assessed lung uptake, transient ischemic dilation, post-stress ejection fraction, summed stress score, summed rest score, and summed difference score. In conclusion, in patients with CAD, beta blocker therapy does not affect the extent, severity, and reversibility of perfusion defects on adenosine SPECT MPI.", 
    "42": "The height of the dicrotic notch between the systolic and diastolic peaks of the peripheral pulse wave, expressed as a fraction of the overall amplitude of the wave, is sensitive to nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity. This phenomenon might form the basis of a simple, non-invasive method for determining endothelial function in vivo. We assessed whether the phenomenon is specific to the NO pathway or whether other vasoactive agents have similar effects. The relative height of the dicrotic notch (RHDN) was determined by photoplethysmography in the rabbit ear. It was dose-dependently decreased by acetylcholine, a stimulator of endothelial NO synthesis, and increased by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthesis. There was no effect on RHDN of the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine or the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin dose-dependently decreased RHDN but this effect was blocked by L-NAME, suggesting it was mediated by cross-talk with the NO pathway. Changes in RHDN appeared to be independent of heart rate and of the delay between the systolic peak and the notch, but were associated with changes in the slope of the dicrotic limb. Both L-NAME and phentolamine produced multiple diastolic peaks, indicative of wave reflections in the vasculature. These data support the view that changes in RHDN are specific to the NO pathway and provide additional information about the mechanisms involved.",

    "46": "The recording of CHD-related quality indicators and prescribing increased dramatically (mean absolute increase of 17.1%) after the introduction of the nGMS contract. Post-contract, disparities between patient subgroups, continued for certain components of care.

    "48": "Calcium is an important second messenger in the rat pineal gland, as well as cAMP. They both contribute to melatonin synthesis mediated by the three main enzymes of the melatonin synthesis pathway: tryptophan hydroxylase, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase. The cytosolic calcium is elevated in pinealocytes following alpha(1)-adrenergic stimulation, through IP(3)-and membrane calcium channels activation. Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduces melatonin synthesis in rat pineal glands in vitro. With the purpose of investigating the mechanisms involved in melatonin synthesis regulation by the L-type calcium channel, we studied the effects of nifedipine on noradrenergic stimulated cultured rat pineal glands. Tryptophan hydroxylase, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase and hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities were quantified by radiometric assays and 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, N-acetylserotonin and melatonin contents were quantified by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The data showed that calcium influx blockaded by nifedipine caused a decrease in tryptophan hydroxylase activity, but did not change either arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase or hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase activities. Moreover, there was a reduction of 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, N-acetylserotonin and melatonin intracellular content, as well as a reduction of serotonin and melatonin secretion. Thus, it seems that the calcium influx through L-type high voltage-activated calcium channels is essential for the full activation of tryptophan hydroxylase leading to melatonin synthesis in the pineal gland.",

Praziquantel has been so effective that alternative therapies are increasingly difficult to obtain, and the development of novel medications has been limited. The possibility of praziquantel resistance is a grave concern. Low cure rates for praziquantel have been reported in several countries, but despite widespread use, no significant loss of efficacy has occurred to date. The primary goal of antischistosomal therapy is parasite eradication, which reduces the likelihood of chronic complications, including advanced hepatic fibrosis. Mild to moderate hepatic fibrosis results from the immune response to schistosome eggs deposited in the portal venules and reverses with successful treatment. Most individuals clear schistosomiasis with a single course of therapy. Repeat doses cure the majority of patients in whom eradication does not occur after the initial dose. A secondary goal of therapy for patients with persistent or recurrent infection is egg burden reduction, which also reduces the risk of hepatic fibrosis and lowers community spread. Community eradication programs in highly endemic regions use periodic retreatment to limit chronic schistosomiasis' morbidity. Advanced liver fibrosis and portal hypertension due to chronic schistosomiasis are irreversible. Variceal bleeding is the primary cause of death in hepatic schistosomiasis. The bleeding risk is best reduced through use of beta-blocker prophylaxis or endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy. Surgical management of varices, including splenectomy with esophagogastric devascularization or selective shunts such as the distal splenorenal, is effective in patients with recalcitrant bleeding. Because hepatic synthetic function is normal in patients with schistosomiasis, procedures that reduce portal pressures may lower hepatic perfusion and cause hepatic impairment. The risk of encephalopathy after shunt surgery is higher in patients with schistosomiasis than in those with cirrhosis. For these reasons, nonselective shunt surgery such as the proximal splenorenal or the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt should not be performed in patients with advanced hepatic schistosomiasis.", 
    "50": "Portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) and gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) are two distinct gastric mucosal lesions that may cause acute and/or chronic upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis. Whereas PHG is associated with portal hypertension, GAVE may present in patients without portal hypertension or liver disease. Diagnosis is made upon visualization of the characteristic lesions with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, although the differential may be difficult at times. PHG is characterized endoscopically by a mosaic pattern with or without red signs and a proximal distribution. PHG mainly causes chronic blood loss and anemia in patients with cirrhosis but also can cause acute hemorrhage. First-line therapy for chronic hemorrhage from PHG is a nonselective beta-blocker (propranolol or nadolol) and iron supplementation. If bleeding/anemia are not controlled with these measures and the patient is transfusion-dependent, shunt therapy (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt or shunt surgery) should be considered. Management of acute bleeding from PHG, an infrequent event, should be accomplished with a vasoactive drug, somatostatin (or its analogues) or terlipressin. If bleeding responds, the patient must be switched to a nonselective beta-blocker. Shunt therapy should be considered in patients who rebleed or continue to bleed despite adequate beta-blocker therapy. GAVE is less common than PHG. It is characterized by red spots without a background mosaic pattern, typically in the gastric antrum. When lesions have a linear distribution, the lesion is called \"watermelon stomach.\" GAVE is a cause of chronic gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia in patients with cirrhosis. If lesions are localized, first-line therapy is argon plasma coagulation. In more diffuse lesions, therapy with argon plasma coagulation is more complicated. Preliminary data suggest that cryotherapy may be a reasonable option for diffuse GAVE lesions. Neither beta-blockers nor TIPS reduces the bleeding risk in patients with GAVE and thus should not be used in this setting.",

Growing evidence has shown recent improvements in pharmacological therapy, such as receptor-regulating agents, in treating heart failure; however, the morbidity and mortality of heart failure is still high. More recent studies have suggested the presence of additional molecular targets for treating heart failure. Several key molecules in the beta adrenergic receptor signaling pathway play an important role in the progression of heart failure, and transgenic mice studies supported beneficial effects of controlling such molecules in heart failure. In addition, molecules in the renin-angiotensin system or calcium signaling pathway may also be potential targets for treating heart failure. In this review, we focused on putative mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of regulating these molecules on the progression of heart failure including relevant patents on this topic.", 
    "52": "Although their specific mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, beta blockers are most likely lower blood pressure and provide target organ protection by several different mechanisms, including inhibition of renin-angiotensine system by decreasing renin release by the jugstaglomerular cells of the kidney, central inhibition of sympathetic nervous system outflow and slowing of heart rate with a decrease in cardiac output. These agents are widely recommended as important parts of antihypertensive regimens and as well as preferred therapies for patients at high risks of coronary heart disease, and including those with angina pectoris, myocardial infarction or heart failure. The third generation beta blockers are distinguished from the earlier class of beta blockers by their vasodilating activity. Labetalol, carvedilol and bucindolol appear to provide a vasodilation primarily through their blockade of alpha-1 rerceptors. Nebivolol is a lipophilic beta reseptor blocker of third generation with distinct beta-1 with selective and vasodilating properties. A number of experimental and human pharmological studies suggest that the vasodilatation is triggered via increasing vascular NO bioavailabilty which is a consequence of stimulation of NO release and antioxidant properties of this compound. The pharmocological profile is characterised by the significant antihypertensive effect as well as lowering of cardiac pre and after load. Nebivolol is well tolerated and does not appear to significantly influence glucose or plasma lipid metabolism. It is devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). This article will review patents, novel composition, pharmacology, haemodynamics, antihypertensive efficiency, metabolic effect and tolerability of nebivolol.",

We have developed a screening cascade which identifies small molecule modulators of ADDL-mediated neurotoxicity. The primary screen involves a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay which selects inhibitors of Abeta1-42 oligomer assembly. The identified hits were further characterized by assessing their ability to inhibit the assembly and binding of ADDLs to cultures of primary hippocampal neurons. This approach has led to the identification of a number of small molecules which inhibit ADDL assembly and their subsequent binding to neurons. Here we describe our small molecule discovery efforts to identify ADDL assembly blocker and ADDL binding inhibitors, and to transform validated hits into pre-clinical lead compounds.",

    "77": "Glutamate spillover regulates GABAergic synaptic transmission at several CNS synapses via presynaptic ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). We have previously demonstrated that activation of group I-III mGluRs inhibits GABAergic transmission in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region involved in organizing behavioral responses to threat, stress, and pain. Here, we examined the role of glutamate spillover in the modulation of GABAergic transmission in the PAG. Using whole-cell recordings from rat PAG slices, we found that evoked IPSCs were reduced by the nonspecific glutamate transport blockers DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) and L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, but not by the glial GLT1-specific blocker dihydrokainate. In contrast, TBOA had no effect on evoked IPSCs when glutamate uptake into the postsynaptic neuron was selectively impaired. TBOA increased the paired-pulse ratio of evoked IPSCs and reduced the rate but not the amplitude of spontaneous miniature IPSCs. The effect of TBOA on evoked IPSCs was abolished by the broad-spectrum mGluR antagonist (2S)-2-amino-2-[(1S,2S)-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl]-3-(xanth-9-yl) propanoic acid (100 microM), reduced by the mGluR5-specific antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP) and mimicked by the mGluR1/5 agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). Furthermore, the effects of both TBOA and DHPG were reduced by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251). Finally, although MPEP and AM251 had no effect on single evoked IPSCs, they increased evoked IPSCs during repetitive stimulation. These results indicate that neuronal glutamate transporters limit mGluR5 activation and endocannabinoid signaling, but may be overwhelmed during conditions of elevated glutamate release. Thus, neuronal glutamate transporters play a key role in regulating endocannabinoid-mediated cross talk between glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses within the PAG.", 
    "78": "Rosuvastatin is additive to high-dose candesartan in slowing progression of experimental mesangioproliferative glomerulosclerosis (GS). Progressive mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, mostly IgA nephropathy, is a major cause of end-stage kidney disease worldwide. In a chronic-progressive model of mesangioproliferative GS, we tested the renoprotective efficacy of rosuvastatin alone and in combination with a high-dose of the AT(1) blocker candesartan. Treatment was started 1 wk after disease induction (anti-thy1 antibody injection into uninephrectomized rats) and continued until week 20. Tubulointerstitial expression of the key fibrosis mediator transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta served as the main marker of disease progression. Compared with the untreated GS rats (475 +/- 52 pg/ml), tubulointerstitial TGF-beta(1) protein expression was significantly reduced by both single therapies (rosuvastatin -47%, candesartan -51%, P < 0.01). Tubulointerstitial matrix accumulation (matrix score in GS: 64 +/- 7%) was relatively reduced by -45 and -52%, respectively (P < 0.01). The combination of rosuvastatin and candesartan had significantly greater effects on tubulointerstitial TGF-beta(1) expression (-82% vs. GS) and matrix accumulation (-83% vs. GS) (P < 0.001 vs. GS, P < 0.05 vs. single therapy) than either drug alone. Similar additive beneficial effects were observed for renal fibronectin and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 expression, cell proliferation, macrophage infiltration, proteinuria, and kidney function. In conclusion, rosuvastatin limits the progressive course of anti-thy1-induced GS toward chronic tubulointerstitial fibrosis and renal insufficiency to a degree comparable to the one achieved by a high dose of the AT(1) antagonist candesartan. Combined treatment yields significantly greater actions on renal TGF-beta overexpression and matrix accumulation, cell proliferation, and macrophage infiltration. The results suggest that rosuvastatin and an AT(1) blocker independently interfere with separate key pathways involved in the progression of chronic mesangioproliferative GS.",

The parent compound was quantified with HPLC, and the metabolites were identified with QToF MS. Propranolol was metabolized rapidly, during the first hour its level decreased by 80 and 50% of the initial 20 and 100 mg L(-1), respectively. Ten peaks were observed on the HPLC-RF chromatogram. Four peaks were identified with QToF MS/MS propranolol (m/z = 260), N-desisopropylpropranolol (m/z = 218), hydroxypropranolol (m/z = 276), and hydroxy N-desisopropranolol glycol (m/z = 235). Then the ecotoxicity of the reaction mixture was studied with two bioassays Spirotox with the protozoan Spirostomum ambiguum and Thamnotoxkit F with the anostracean crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus. Propranolol is twofolds more toxic to Spirotox than to Thamnotoxkit F with 24 h-EC50 = 1.77 mg L(-1) and 24 h-LC50 = 3.86 mg L(-1), respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between the toxicity of the reaction mixtures after S9 biotransformation and the propranolol solution. These results indicate that the biological activity of the metabolites is similar to that of the parent drug. The presented method of in vitro biotransformation of drugs with S9 fraction followed by HPLC and ecotoxicity tests, may be used as screening method for evaluation of the toxicity of drug metabolites.",

The monolithic silica matrix containing a vinyl functionality was synthesized by in situ cocondensation of tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) and vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) via sol-gel process and chemically modified with calix[4] open-chain crown ether by free radical polymerization procedure using alpha, alpha'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as an initiator. Morphology of the monolithic column was examined by SEM and the successful incorporation of calix[4] open-chain crown ether to the vinyl-hybrid monolith was characterized by infrared (IR) spectra. Compared with an unmodified vinyl-hybrid monolithic column, slightly stronger EOF at pH >7.5 was observed for this monolithic column due to the ionization of phenolic hydroxyls on the lower rim of calix[4]arene. VTMS/TMOS ratios in the reaction mixture were varied and 1:4 was found to be optimum to obtain homogeneous monolith with good permeability. The performance of the column was evaluated by nucleotides, beta-blockers, neurotransmitters, and PAHs as test solutes and compared with that of unmodified vinyl-hybrid monolithic column. Greatly improved column performance was obtained due to the host-guest interaction and intermolecular hydrogen bonding provided by the calix[4] open-chain crown ether moiety. The column efficiencies for neurotransmitters and nucleotides are up to 120 000 and 110 000 plates/m, respectively. Migration time and theoretical plate number reproducibilities were reasonable with RSDs less than 1.0 and 1.8% each for within column runs and not more than 7.2 and 8.6% each for column-to-column measurements, using four nucleotides as test solutes.",

This review examines the potential mechanisms and indications for peri-operative statin protection, the efficacy of acute peri-operative beta-blockade in addition to statin therapy, the effect of peri-operative statin therapy withdrawal and the implications of comorbidities associated with peri-operative cardiovascular risk on statin therapy. Recommendations concerning appropriate dosing, duration, therapeutic targets and necessary investigations when prescribing peri-operative statins are made.

Recommendations are made regarding retrospective reporting of statin studies to minimise the bias inherent in a number of the current retrospective studies on this subject.", 
    "91": "Cushing's syndrome due to ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) can be associated with abnormal responses of aberrantly expressed adrenocortical receptors. This study aimed to characterize in vitro the pathophysiology of hypercortisolism in a beta-blocker-sensitive Cushing's syndrome due to AIMAH. Cortisol secretion profile under aberrant receptors stimulation revealed hyperresponsiveness to salbutamol (beta2-adrenoceptor agonist), cisapride (5-HT4 receptor agonist), and vasopressin in AIMAH cultured cells, but not in normal adrenocortical cells. By RT-PCR, AIMAH tissues revealed beta2-adrenoceptor overexpression rather than ectopical expression. MC2R expression was similar in both AIMAH and normal adrenocortical tissues. Curiously, cortisol levels of AIMAH cells under basal condition were 15-fold higher than those of control cells and were not responsive to ACTH. Analysis of culture medium from AIMAH cells could detect the presence of ACTH, which was immunohistochemically confirmed. Finally, the present study of AIMAH cells has identified: a) cortisol hyperresponsiveness to catecholamines, 5-HT4 and vasopressin in vitro, in agreement with clinical screening tests; b) abnormal expression of beta2-adrenoceptors in some areas of the hyperplastic adrenal tissue; c) autocrine loop of ACTH production.

The clinical parameters, plasma BNP levels and echocardiographic indices were measured blind on the same day, on admission and then once a week for three weeks. On admission, the NYHA was 2.9+/-0.1, mean plasma creatinine 99+/-3 micromol/l, plasma BNP 503+/-57 pg/ml, LVEF 29+/-1%, E/A ratio 1.9+/-0.2, E/Ea ratio 8.8+/-0.3, E wave deceleration time 155+/-9 ms, systolic pulmonary artery pressure 40+/-2 mmHg and the diameter of the inferior vena cava was 16+/-1 mm. Over the course of follow up, an episode of acute decompensation occurred in 16% of the patients (8/50). Using univariate analysis, age and initial (admission) values for NYHA class, blood pressure, plasma BNP level, E/A ratio, E wave deceleration time, E/Ea ratio and the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure allowed prediction of the occurrence of acute decompensation following initiation and titration of bisoprolol. The use of the initial value of NYHA class alone allowed prediction of the occurrence of acute decompensation in just 56% of the patients, and the absence of an occurrence of acute decompensation in 93% of them.

The rate of use of the quality indicators was higher in our survey than that observed in all of the published studies, except for the use of betablockers. The quality of care could therefore be considered as highly satisfactory. Comparison between the centres revealed some differences. Even after adjustment for the risk score on admission, the quality score for acute care was related to mortality at 1 month.",

    "100": "Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-blocker with additional alpha1-adrenergic blocking and antioxidant properties, has been shown to be cardioprotective in experimental myocarditis. However, the antioxidative effects of carvedilol have not been investigated in the setting of acute viral myocarditis. Therefore, this study investigated whether carvedilol protects against viral myocarditis primarily by its antioxidant and/or antiinflammatory properties. In a coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis model (Balb/c), effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on myocardial histopathological changes, cytokine levels, virus titers, malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were studied. Carvedilol markedly attenuated myocardial lesions and increased interferon-gamma and interleukin-12 production (cytokines) on day 7 with concomitant reduction of myocardial virus replication. In addition, only carvedilol decreased the content of MDA and increased the content of SOD on day 14. Metoprolol as well as bunazosin (a higly selective alpha1-adrenergic blocking agent) had no significant effects in this model. The results indicate that the superior protection of carvedilol in this model is probably the result of its antioxidative effects and the upregulation of antiinflammatory cytokines.",

BRL(37344) abolished the ISO-mediated positive lusitropism. beta3-AR-dependent effects on relaxation were insensitive to beta(1)/beta2-AR inhibition by nadolol (100 nm), and were abolished by G(i/o) protein inhibition by PTx (0.01 nm). NO scavenging by haemoglobin (10 microm), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition by NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (10 microm) revealed the involvement of NO signalling in BRL(37344) response. Pre-treatment with inhibitors of either soluble guanylate cyclase (ODQ; 10 microm) or PKG (KT(5823); 100 nm) abolished beta3-AR-dependent negative lusitropism.

The hydroxyapatite incorporation into silica has demonstrated excellent bioactivity or biodegradability, according to the content of calcium ions. Procedures to obtain ordered mesoporous silicates rely on the micelle-forming properties of a surfactant, whose chemical composition, size and concentration control the structural dimensions of the final material. This paper reports the synthesis of two types mesoporous materials: pure MCM-41 and a nanocomposite of apatite and mesoporous silica, MCM-41-HA. The samples were charged with atenolol as a model drug and in vitro release essays were carried out. The bioactivity behavior was investigated as a function of soaking time in simulated body fluid. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, dispersive energies spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The influence of the release rate of atenolol molecules from pure MCM-41 mesoporous and containing hydroxyapatite was demonstrated, since it results in a very slowly drug delivery from the nanocomposite system.",

Here we report the effect of NE on the cytokine response of a mixed population of human DC cells to extracellular stimuli. These cells were obtained by differentiating human cord blood CD34+ precursor cells. NE inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated production of interleukin (IL)-23, IL-12 p40, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 whereas the expression of IL-10 was not significantly affected. Thus, human cord blood-derived DC respond to NE in a manner similar to mouse Langerhans cells (LC). Furthermore, forskolin also inhibited the LPS-induced levels of TNF-alpha, IL-12 p40, IL-23 p19 and IL-6, supporting the hypothesis that the effects of NE are mediated by cAMP. Data from experiments using inhibitors of adrenergic receptors suggest that NE acts through beta-adrenergic receptors. As IL-23 promotes the differentiation of CD4+ T cells required for T(H)1-mediated immunity, we suggest that NE decreases the differentiation of CD4+ T cells needed for T(H)1-mediated contact hypersensitivity and that NE is a candidate regulator of human DC functions in the skin.",

    "135": "The effects of diabetes on heart function may be initiated or compounded by the exaggerated reliance of the diabetic heart on fatty acids and ketones as metabolic fuels. beta-Blocking agents such as metoprolol have been proposed to inhibit fatty acid oxidation. We hypothesized that metoprolol would improve cardiac function by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation and promoting a compensatory increase in glucose utilization. We measured ex vivo cardiac function and substrate utilization after chronic metoprolol treatment and acute metoprolol perfusion. Chronic metoprolol treatment attenuated the development of cardiac dysfunction in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. After chronic treatment with metoprolol, palmitate oxidation was increased in control hearts but decreased in diabetic hearts without affecting myocardial energetics. Acute treatment with metoprolol during heart perfusions led to reduced rates of palmitate oxidation, stimulation of glucose oxidation, and increased tissue ATP levels. Metoprolol lowered malonyl-CoA levels in control hearts only, but no changes in acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation or AMP-activated protein kinase activity were observed. Both acute metoprolol perfusion and chronic in vivo metoprolol treatment led to decreased maximum activity and decreased sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I to malonyl-CoA. Metoprolol also increased sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase expression and prevented the reexpression of atrial natriuretic peptide in diabetic hearts. These data demonstrate that metoprolol ameliorates diabetic cardiomyopathy and inhibits fatty acid oxidation in streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Since malonyl-CoA levels are not increased, the reduction in total carnitine palmitoyltransferase I activity is the most likely factor to explain the decrease in fatty acid oxidation. The metabolism changes occur in parallel with changes in gene expression.",

    "156": "We previously reported that mast cells express renin, the rate-limiting enzyme in the renin-angiotensin cascade. We have now assessed whether mast cell renin release triggers angiotensin formation in the airway. In isolated rat bronchial rings, mast cell degranulation released enzyme with angiotensin I-forming activity blocked by the selective renin inhibitor BILA2157. Local generation of angiotensin (ANG II) from mast cell renin elicited bronchial smooth muscle contraction mediated by ANG II type 1 receptors (AT(1)R). In a guinea pig model of immediate type hypersensitivity, anaphylactic mast cell degranulation in bronchial rings resulted in ANG II-mediated constriction. As in rat bronchial rings, bronchoconstriction (BC) was inhibited by a renin inhibitor, an AT(1)R blocker, and a mast cell stabilizer. Anaphylactic release of renin, histamine, and beta-hexosaminidase from mast cells was confirmed in the effluent from isolated, perfused guinea pig lung. To relate the significance of this finding to humans, mast cells were isolated from macroscopically normal human lung waste tissue specimens. Sequence analysis of human lung mast cell RNA showed 100% homology between human lung mast cell renin and kidney renin between exons 1 and 10. Furthermore, the renin protein expressed in lung mast cells was enzymatically active. Our results demonstrate the existence of an airway renin-angiotensin system triggered by release of mast-cell renin. The data show that locally produced ANG II is a critical factor governing BC, opening the possibility for novel therapeutic targets in the management of airway disease.", 
    "157": "Catecholamines directly stimulate GH, ACTH, and prolactin secretion from rat anterior pituitary through the beta(2)-adrenoceptor (AR). We recently showed that gonadotrophs express the beta(1)-AR and that glucocorticoids drastically increase its mRNA expression level. The present investigation explores whether beta(1)-ARs are functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase. In anterior pituitary cell aggregates, the highly selective beta(1)-AR antagonists CGP 20712A and ICI 89,406-8a attenuated isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation, but no agonist action of norepinephrine could be detected. Remarkably, CGP 20712A inhibited basal cAMP levels by its own for at least 50%, an action that tended to be more effective in dexamethasone-supplemented medium. The latter effect was abolished by the beta-AR antagonist carvedilol, but not by other beta-AR antagonists. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin abolished the action of CGP 20712A on basal cAMP. CGP 20712A also attenuated isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation in the gonadotroph cell lines alphaT3-1 and LbetaT2, but not in the somatotroph precursor cell line GHFT and the folliculo-stellate cell line TtT/GF. However, in LbetaT2 cells CGP 20712A did not inhibit basal cAMP levels by its own. The present data suggest that beta(1)-AR in the anterior pituitary is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase but is constitutively active in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. CGP 20712A may act as an inverse agonist with approximately 50% negative intrinsic activity, suggesting that the beta(1)-AR significantly contributes to basal adenylate cyclase activity in the pituitary.", 
    "158": "We investigated the role played by catecholamine-dependent pathways in modulating the ability of centrally administered corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) to activate sympatho-adrenomedullay outflow, using urethane-anesthetized rats. The CRF (1.5 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevations of both plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline were attenuated by phentolamine (a non-selective alpha adrenoceptor antagonist) [125 and 250 microg (0.33 and 0.66 micromol)/animal], Heat (a selective alpha(1) adrenoceptor antagonist) [10 and 30 microg (30 and 90 nmol)/animal, i.c.v.] and clonidine (a selective alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist) [100 microg (0.375 micromol)/animal, i.c.v.]. On the other hand, the CRF (1.5 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of both catecholamines was not influenced by RS 79948 (a selective alpha(2) adrenoceptor antagonist) [10 and 30 microg (7.2 and 72 nmol)/animal, i.c.v.]. Furthermore, the CRF (1.5 nmol/animal, i.c.v.)-induced elevation of noradrenaline was attenuated by sotalol (a non-selective beta adrenoceptor antagonist) [125 and 250 microg (0.4 and 0.8 micromol)/animal, i.c.v.], while that of adrenaline was not influenced by sotalol. These results suggest that centrally administered CRF-induced elevation of plasma noradrenaline is mediated by an activation of alpha(1) and beta adrenoceptors in the brain, and that of plasma adrenaline is mediated by an activation of alpha(1) adrenoceptors in the brain. Furthermore, central alpha(2) adrenoceptors are involved in modulating the CRF-induced elevation of both plasma catecholamines.",

We prospectively investigated the persistence on therapy and the extent of blood pressure (BP) control in 347 hypertensive patients (age 59.4 +/- 6 years) randomly allocated to a first-line treatment with: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), beta-blockers, angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), or diuretics and followed-up for 24-months. Persistence on treatment was higher in patients treated with ARBs (68.5%) and ACE inhibitors (64.5%) vs CCBs (51.6%; p < 0.05), beta-blockers (44.8%, p < 0.05), and diuretics (34.4%, p < 0.01). No ARB, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, or diuretic was associated with a higher persistence in therapy compared with the other molecules used in each therapeutic class.

    "168": "Nebivolol is a third generation beta-blocker, which can be distinguished from other beta-blockers by its hemodynamic profile. It combines beta-adrenergic blocking activity with a vasodilating effect mediated by the endothelial L-arginine nitric oxide (NO) pathway. The effects of nebivolol have been compared with other beta-blockers and also with other classes of antihypertensive agents. In general, response rates to treatment are higher, and the frequency and severity of adverse events are either comparable or lower with nebivolol. Nebivolol is also effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in elderly patients with heart failure, regardless of the initial ejection fraction. Endothelium-derived NO is important in the regulation of large arterial stiffness, which in turn is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Treatment with nebivolol increases the release of NO from the endothelium and improves endothelial function, leading to a reduction in arterial stiffness. Decreased arterial stiffness has beneficial hemodynamic effects including reductions in central aortic blood pressure. Unlike first generation beta-blockerrs, vasodilator beta-blockerrs such as nebivolol have favorable hemodynamic effects, which may translate into improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension.", 
    "169": "Intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of investigational antiglaucoma drugs often need comparison with existing drugs, but detailed data showing comparative efficacy of antiglaucoma drugs with different mechanism of action has not been reported so far. This study was designed to establish baseline information of the IOP-lowering effect of three currently used antiglaucoma drugs in three experimental models in rabbits, so that they act as a benchmark for the efficacy evaluation of the future experimental antiglaucoma drugs. The IOP-lowering effect of single-drop application of pilocarpine, timolol and latanoprost was studied in normotensive, water loading and steroid-induced models of glaucoma in rabbits. The noncontact tonometer was used for the first time to estimate IOP in rabbits. The peak IOP-lowering effect of pilocarpine, timolol and latanoprost in normotensive rabbit eye was 18.23%, 20% and 22.56%, respectively. In water-loading model, the maximum protection against the rise in IOP was shown by latanoprost (40.27%), followed by timolol (31.39%) and pilocarpine (28.91%). In steroid-pretreated rabbit eyes, peak IOP-lowering effects of pilocarpine, timolol and latanoprost were 25.65%, 34.21% and 35.06%, respectively. Therefore, the latanoprost was found to be most effective in all three models followed by timolol and pilocarpine. The results of this study can be used for future preclinical investigations for the assessment of IOP-lowering activity of potential antiglaucoma drugs.", 
    "170": "Recent studies have shown that antihypertensive drugs like diuretics increase plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels. However, the effect of other antihypertensive drugs on plasma Hcy levels has not been tested extensively. The aim of present study was to investigate the effect of antihypertensive therapy (AHT) on Hcy levels in essential hypertensive subjects. A case-control study of 273 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and 103 normotensive controls was undertaken. Plasma Hcy levels were measured before and after 6 weeks of AHT. The genotyping of MTHFR C677T polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers significantly decreased and hydrochlorothiazides significantly increased the plasma Hcy levels in hypertensive patients (P<0.05). No significant association between MTHFR C677T genotypes and changes in Hcy levels in response to antihypertensive was observed in EH patients. The decrease in Hcy induced by beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors observed in our study may be due to the improvement of endothelial function along with improved renal function. Thus, our results suggest that ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers may provide additional beneficial therapeutic effects to the EH patients by decreasing Hcy levels.", 
    "171": "T-type calcium channel blockers have been previously shown to protect glomeruli from hypertension by regulating renal arteriolar tone. To examine whether blockade of these channels has a role in protection against tubulointerstitial damage, we used a stereo-selective T-type calcium channel blocker R(-)-efonidipine and studied its effect on the progression of this type of renal injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats that had undergone subtotal nephrectomy. Treatment with racemic efonidipine for 7 weeks significantly reduced systolic blood pressure and proteinuria. The R(-)-enantiomer, however, had no effect on blood pressure but significantly reduced proteinuria compared to vehicle-treated rats. Both agents blunted the increase in tubulointerstitial fibrosis, renal expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin along with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced renal Rho-kinase activity seen in the control group. Subtotal nephrectomy enhanced renal T-type calcium channel alpha1G subunit expression mimicked in angiotensin II-stimulated mesangial cells or TGF-beta-stimulated proximal tubular cells. Our study shows that T-type calcium channel blockade has renal protective actions that depend not only on hemodynamic effects but also pertain to Rho-kinase activity, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transitions.",
