    "0": "The regression of the ECG signs of myocardial infarction has been studied in 101 patients. A significant increase in R wave amplitude and decrease in Q wave depth on the standard ECG was observed over three months. In 21% of the patients, Q waves disappeared completely. In inferior infarction, these changes were more apparent in the lateral V leads than in the inferior limb leads. Patients with intraventricular conduction defects were excluded. Two factors associated with the Q and R wave changes have been identified. Lower heart rates appeared to facilitate the recovery of R waves, and smaller infarcts, as assessed by peak LDH, showed greater ECG recovery. This study raises the interesting possibility that modification of the heart rate may affect favourably the healing process after an acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "1": "The introduction of calcium antagonists has had a significant influence on the management of angina pectoris. Whereas, a beta blocker functions by reducing oxygen demand, the calcium antagonists increase oxygen supply and also decrease oxygen demand. The calcium ion is a vital link in excitation-contraction coupling; the regulation of intracellular calcium levels directly modulates cardiac and smooth muscle function. The three agents currently in use are verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem; ony the first two are available by prescription at this time. Although all three are calcium channel blocking agents, they differ in their electrophysiologic effects. Verapamil and, to a lesser extent, diltiazem slow AV nodal transmission and are thus helpful in controlling the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation. All have a negative inotropic property which may limit their use in patients with advanced left ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "2": "Blockade of the autonomic nervous system by injection of propranolol (0,2 mg/Kg) and atropine (0,04 mg/Kg) was carried out in a series of 48 patients classified in 3 groups:--Group I:sinus bradycardia (22 cases)--Group II:suspected tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome (14 cases)--Group III:suspected sinus node dysfunction (12 cases). Two parameters were studied after autonomic blockade: observed intrinsic sinus node frequency (OIF) and corrected \"adjusted\" sinus node recovery time (CASRT). The results were compared with those obtained during basal electrophysiological investigation. The OIF was abnormal in 26 cases (54%) and junctional rhythm was observed 9 times (19%). Prolongation of the post-stimulation pause occurred in 32 cases (67%), transformation from a normal to a pathological pause in 15 cases and normalisation of a pathological pause in 4 cases (8%). Sinus node recovery time did not change significantly in the other cases. There was a good correlation between OIF and CASRT when the OIF was abnormal and mediocre (48%), when the OIF was normal. The following conclusions were made:--CASRT improves diagnosis of organic sinus node dysfunction which may escape detection by basal electrophysiological investigation and excludes functional abnormalities.--OIF is of good diagnostic value when pathological. However, the integrity of sinus node function cannot be affirmed when this parameter is normal.", 
    "3": "The effect of pindolol, a new beta-blocking agent, was evaluated in 12 patients with proven coronary disease (CAD) and angina pectoris. Evaluation was done using a double-blind crossover technique comparing pindolol at both 15 mg/day and 30 mg/day to placebo. Compared with placebo, pindolol slightly decreased the number of anginal episodes and nitroglycerin pills consumed while showing evidence of beta blockade during exercise. However, we could not demonstrate any effect on exercise endurance on the treadmill at either dose. Pindolol shows a modest beneficial effect on ischemic manifestations in CAD patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "4": "1. Two patients with orthostatic hypotension due to peripheral autonomic neuropathy were studied. The diagnosis was based on severe hypotension during 60 degrees head-up tilting and absence of the systolic pressure overshoot in phase IV of the Valsalva response. Plasma noradrenaline levels were 50 and 90 pg/ml in the two patients. Noradrenaline was unresponsive to head-up tilting. Heart rate did not change after atropine, 1 mg i.v. Thus the patients had combined efferent sympathetic and parasympathetic lesions. 2. Infusion of isoprenaline in these patients showed supersensitivity for the chronotropic and vascular effects of this drug. Similar cardiac and vascular supersensitivity was observed for salbutamol. The patients were treated with pindolol, 15 mg daily divided in three doses. After 4 weeks treatment pindolol was stopped and the infusion of isoprenaline and salbutamol were repeated 72 h after the last dose of pindolol, 5 mg. The isoprenaline dose-heart rate response curve was shifted to the right by a factor of 9 and 14 in the two patients. The salbutamol dose-heart rate response curve was shifted by a factor of 61 in both patients. 3. The observed chronotropic effects of salbutamol provides evidence for the existance of cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors in man. Comparison between the cardiovascular responses to the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline and the beta 2-selective agonist salbutamol suggest preferential beta 2-adrenoceptor sensitization in chronic autonomic failure, which can be reversed by treatment with the non-selective partial beta-adrenoceptor agonist pindolol.", 
    "5": "Brain cannulated rats were injected with the opioid peptide beta-endorphin (beta-EP) directly into the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) where norepinephrine (NE) is most effective in stimulating eating behavior. Beta-Endorphin (1.0 nmole) reliably increased food intake in satiated animals, and this response was blocked by local administration of the selective opiate antagonist naloxone. The eating induced by beta-EP was positively correlated in magnitude with the NE response and, like NE, was antagonized by PVN injection of the alpha-noradrenergic blocker phentolamine. Naloxone had no effect on NE-induced eating, and the dopaminergic blocker fluphenazine failed to alter either beta-EP or NE eating. When injected simultaneously, at maximally effective doses, beta-EP and NE produced an eating response which was significantly larger than either of the responses elicited separately by beta-EP or NE and was essentially equal to the sum of these two responses. The evidence obtained in this study suggests that beta-EP and NE stimulate food ingestion through their action on PVN opiate and alpha-noradrenergic receptors, respectively, and that beta-EP's action is closely related to, and in part may be dependent upon, the PVN alpha-noradrenergic system for feeding control.", 
    "6": "Relationship between contraction and cyclic AMP levels induced by BaCl2 was examined in the longitudinal smooth muscle isolated from guinea pig ileum. BaCl2 3 X 10(-3)M caused a fast initial contraction, often followed by a gradual decrease of the contractile state. There was an increase in the tissue cyclic AMP 7 min or 14 min after the application of Ba. A phosphodiesterase activator imidazole reinforced the later phase of contraction by Ba and inhibited the increase in cyclic AMP. These results indicate that there is still a positive correlation between relaxation and increase in cyclic AMP and that an inhibitory action mediated by cyclic AMP is veiled behind the Ba contraction. Furthermore, these results may be interpreted by assuming that strong Ba contraction operates a feedback mechanism and that the feedback mechanism is associated with cyclic AMP increase. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandins synthesis, little influenced the Ba-induced increase in cyclic AMP and rather inhibited the Ba contraction. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, failed to exert influence on the Ba contraction. Based on these facts, it is suggested that the increase in cyclic AMP is not mediated by prostaglandins or catecholamines.", 
    "7": "We have examined brain tissue from dystrophic mice (male 129/ReJ-dy and female 129 B6F1/J-dy) to determine whether CNS lesions may accompany the known muscular defects. In all brain regions examined we found a significant reduction in the numbers of beta-adrenergic binding sites when compared to brain from control mice. In contrast, the number of benzodiazepine binding sites appeared normal. These changes in adrenergic sites may be related to the known abnormally high excretion of catecholamines. Our results also emphasise the need to study extra-muscular sites in this disease.", 
    "8": "The highly specific beta-adrenergic radio-ligand (+/-)-125 iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) was used to characterize the beta-adrenergic receptor subtype present in rat kidney. Binding of ICYP to membranes from rat kidney was of high affinity (KD = 68.9 pM) and saturable with 1.06 pmoles ICYP bound/g tissue wet wt at maximal occupancy of the sites. Analysis of inhibition of ICYP binding by beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenergic drugs via pseudo-Scatchard (\"Hoifstee') plots resulted in linear plots indicating the existence of a homogeneous population of beta-adrenergic receptors. From the resulting KD-values for practolol (2.2 microM), metoprolol (0.21 microM), zinterol (0.4 microM) and IPS 339 (0.046 microM) it is concluded that the beta-adrenergic receptor in rat kidney is of the beta 1-subtype. This subclassification is further supported by the fact that (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline were equipotent in inhibiting ICYP binding. The beta-adrenergic agonists (-)-isoprenaline and zinterol bind to two distinct states of this beta 1-receptor, a high and low affinity state. GTP (10(-4) M) converts this heterogeneous binding into a homogeneous low affinity binding.", 
    "9": "To assess the relative contributions that the sodium channel blocking activity of propranolol may play in a variety of its therapeutic applications, its effects were examined in vitro with a sodium channel specific 22Na+ uptake system, using rat brain membranes. Propranolol inhibited 22Na+ uptake in the rat brain membrane preparation by acting as a competitive inhibitor of the binding of the sodium channel opening agent veratridine, with an IC50 for this action of 6.5 microM. This is approximately one order of magnitude higher in concentration than that necessary for expression of the beta-adrenergic antagonism of propranolol. The binding of propranolol and its action to block sodium channels were demonstrably different from those of the neurotoxins tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin. Propranolol had effects on sodium channels that are similar, although not identical to those of the local anesthetics procaine and lidocaine. The concentrations of propranolol and a number of its analogues which produced 50% inhibition of 22Na+ uptake (IC50 values ranging from 4 to greater than 100 microM) were similar to the concentrations of these same analogues which were required to produce negative inotropic and antiarrythmic effects (ED40) on isolated rabbit atria [D. O. Rauls and J. K. Baker, J. med. Chem, 22, 81 (1979)]. These effects showed correlations of 0.945 and 0.936, respectively, with the 22Na+ uptake inhibition. It is concluded from this information that a substantial proportion of the negative inotropic and antiarrythmic effects of propranolol is due to its action on sodium channels.", 
    "10": "Chronic intravenous infusion of reserpine significantly increased beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) in the cerebra cortex of rats. This increase in beta-AR is partially blocked by chronic treatment with alprazolam. However, similar effects were not observed with diazepam. These results indicate that beta-AR may be involved in the antidepressant activity of alprazolam.", 
    "11": "The effects of soterenol on prostaglandin (PG) release by the isolated rat vas deferens were studied. Soterenol increased the amount of PGE1 released into the medium without affecting that of PGE2 or PGF2 alpha. The effect of soterenol was inhibited by phentolamine but not by butoxamine. It is concluded that soterenol elicits the release of PGE1 by the isolated rat vas deferens via stimulation of alpha adrenoreceptors.", 
    "12": "Female Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to endurance-training programs, and the effect of training on myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor number, receptor-binding characteristics, and adenylate cyclase (AC) activities associated with the receptor were examined. Training produced a 45% (P less than 0.01) increase in the succinate dehydrogenase activity of the plantaris muscle. Specific (-)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA)-binding data were subjected to Scatchard plot analysis to quantify beta-adrenergic receptor number and DHA-binding characteristics of myocardial membranes. The DHA concentrations at which 50% of the total binding sites were occupied were similar for membranes from sedentary (1.95 +/- 0.51) and trained (1.59 +/- 0.34 nM) groups. Total DHA-binding sites of membranes from control (91.6 +/- 13.3) and trained (83.1 +/- 7.6 fmol/mg) groups were also similar. Basal and maximally stimulated AC activities were also unchanged by endurance training. Fluoride-stimulated AC activities of crude homogenate and 10,000 g fractions decreased 47 and 49%, respectively, with training. No differences were observed in a 40,000 g fraction. The specific activities of a ouabain-sensitive Na+-K+-ATPase (a sarcolemmal membrane marker) of crude homogenate, 10,000 g, and 40,000 g membrane fractions were similar. These data indicate that training produces no detectable difference in the potential for adrenergic responses at the receptor level.", 
    "13": "The main intention of this study was to characterize the alpha-adrenoceptor responsible for the inhibition of lipolysis in dog fat cell and to define circumstances that may be associated to a modification of the alpha-mediated antilipolytic effect. Isolated fat cells from omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue from normal and obese dogs were used. Basal and theophylline stimulated lipolysis was studied in the presence of selected alpha-adrenergic agonists and antagonists. The antilipolytic effect of catecholamines is mediated by alpha 2-type adrenoceptors in dog fat cell. The alpha-adrenergic responsiveness is enhanced (or unmasked) in large fat cells of obese dogs and depends on the site from which the adipose tissue sample is taken. The alpha-response is stronger in subcutaneous than in omental adipocytes. In conclusion, the weakened lipolytic responsiveness to epinephrine of obese dog fat cells seems related to an increased alpha-adrenergic response rather than a decreased beta-lipolytic effect. Obesity is a circumstance characterized in the dog fat cell by a modification of the balance between alpha-2 and beta receptors.", 
    "14": "The increase in % phosphorylase a associated with muscle contraction is reversed after a few minutes despite continued contractile activity. The present study was undertaken to determine whether adrenaline can activate phosphorylase after deactivation has occurred during prolonged stimulation of contraction. We found that adrenaline reactivates phosphorylase and glycogenolysis in rat fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles that have been stimulated to contract for 15 min. The reactivation of glycogenolysis by adrenaline could have importance in fight-or-flight situations that call for an increase in exercise intensity.", 
    "15": "Constriction of the remaining renal artery of a uninephrectomized rat produced an increase in plasma renin level, a decrease in renal cortex renin level, an increase in blood pressure and a drinking response. Simultaneous infusion with the angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin, potentiated the rise in plasma renin level and blocked the rise in blood pressure. Drinking was only partially attenuated. Pretreatment with l-propranolol had no effect on the changes in plasma or kidney renin levels, but the increase in blood pressure was potentiated and the drinking response was attenuated. It is concluded that the pressor and drinking responses to renal artery constriction are partially mediated by the beta adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "16": "Abrupt withdrawal after the chronic administration of propranolol results in clinical syndromes that suggest adrenergic hypersensitivity. Furthermore, propranolol administration has been shown to lead to an increase in the density of beta adrenergic receptors on human lymphocytes. The present studies were designed to assess the relevance of changes measured in lymphocytes to changes that may occur in solid tissues. Direct measurement of the density and properties of beta adrenergic receptors in membrane fragments was performed in vitro using the radioligand [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol. Chronic infusion of propranolol by s.c. implanted osmotic minipumps generated sustained plasma concentrations of propranolol sufficient to cause chronic blockade of beta adrenergic receptors. Infusion of propranolol for 7 days resulted in significant increases in the density of beta adrenergic receptors in rat ventricles, lungs and lymphocytes. A computer-assisted graphic analysis of results obtained in studies with drugs selective for beta-1 or beta-2 receptors revealed increases in the densities of both beta-1 an beta-2 adrenergic receptors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that change in beta adrenergic receptors on lymphocytes are qualitatively similar to alterations in beta adrenergic receptors in solid tissues not routinely accessible in humans. Increases in the densities of beta-1 and/or beta-2 adrenergic receptors in solid tissues may be related to some of the untoward effects observed in humans after abrupt discontinuation of propranolol administration.", 
    "17": "In the present study, we evaluated the physiological responsiveness of the increased numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors in ischemic canine myocardium to in vivo stimulation by (-)-isoproterenol and epinephrine. After 1 hour of temporary proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and during a 15-minute period of reflow, dogs received (1)-isoproterenol intravenously at a rate sufficient to increase their heart rates 20--40 beats/min. Following the infusion of isoproterenol, myocardial tissue was obtained from the LV ischemic and nonischemic regions for measurement of beta-adrenergic receptor numbers, cyclic AMP content, and phosphorylase b to a conversion. beta-Adrenergic receptor numbers were significantly increased in the left ventricular (LV) ischemic tissue. The administration of (-)-isoproterenol was associated with significant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate content and phosphorylase b to a conversion in the LV ischemic tissue. Also, the administration of (-)-epinephrine significantly increased the phosphorylase b to a conversion in ischemic tissue over the nonischemic tissue and this conversion was blocked by pretreatment with (+/-)-propranolol. These data suggest that, in this experimental model, the increased numbers of beta-adrenergic receptors in canine LV ischemic tissue are capable of translating physiological responses when they are activated with an appropriate agonist in vivo.", 
    "18": "Antialprenolol rabbit antibodies were fractionated on an acebutolol affinity resin, followed by L-propranolol elution so as to separate a class of binding sites that mimic the beta-adrenergic receptor. Allotype-identicaL rabbits were immunized with this fraction. After 6 mo, antisera exhibited antiidiotypic activity inhibiting [3H]alprenolol binding to the original antibody and to rabbit antiacebutolol antibodies, which had a spectrum of ligand-binding properties identical to the original idiotype. Those antisera demonstrating the original idiotype. Those antisera demonstrating the most potent antiidiotypic activity also blocked [3H]alprenolol binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor of turkey membrane, canine pulmonary membrane, and rat reticulocyte. An idiotype affinity-purified fraction showed similar activity, inhibiting beta-receptor binding with a calculated dissociation constant (KD) of 53 nM. Isoproterenol-mediated adenylate cyclase activity was also inhibited in a competitive manner. The universality of recognition of these antiidiotypic antisera indicate that the three-dimensional structure of a receptor's binding site can be modeled by a subset of an elicited antibody population.", 
    "19": "Comparative data are presented on the treatment of auricular fibrillation in 105 patients with severe thyrotoxicosis. All the patients were divided into 3 groups to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment: the 1st group of 45 patients, given complex therapy (mercazolyl, diiodotyrosine, cardiac glycosides, potassium drugs, ATF, cocarboxylase); the 2nd group of 40 subjects, treated with inderal in a dose of 80 to 120 mg during 7 days, followed by complex therapy; the 3d group of patients given complex therapy and cordaron. The latter combined with complex therapy was the most effective method in the treatment of auricular fibrillation in patients who suffered from thyrotoxicosis. In 15 of 20 patients of the 3d group the sinus rhythm was recovered. The treatment effectiveness in this group of patients was not dependent on their age, thyrotoxicosis and arrhythmia duration and the degree of circulatory disturbance, whereas in patients of the 1st group good results, as a rule, were seen in young and middle-aged subjects with the disease duration, not exceeding one year and circulation disorder of the Ist and IInd stages. It is concluded that in pathogenesis of auricular fibrillation the main role belongs to the unfavourable effect of excessive thyroid hormones upon the metabolic processes in myocardial auricles.", 
    "20": "Recent studies indicate that antagonism of calcium channels may not be the only mechanism whereby drugs such as verapamil alter myocardial function. We have examined the effect of verapamil on the binding of [3H]prazosin (alpha 1-adrenergic), [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB, muscarinic) and [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA, beta-adrenergic) to membranes prepared from rat heart. Verapamil competed for the binding of these radioligands in the following rank order: [3H]prazosin greater than [3H]QNB greater than [3H]DHA (Ki for verapamil = 0.6 microM, 7 microM, and 72 microM, respectively). Verapamil (10 microM) competitively inhibited [3H]prazosin binding to rat ventricular membranes; the apparent dissociation constant (KD) of [3H]prazosin increased from 0.13 +/- 0.02 to 1.5 +/- 0.6 nM (SD) without change in maximal binding capacity (Bmax). The effect of verapamil on the affinity of [3H]prazosin was completely reversed by washing the membranes. The verapamil derivative D-600 also inhibited [3H]prazosin binding (Ki = 1.1 microM). Verapamil (30 microM) competitively inhibited [3H]QNB binding in both atria and ventricles and increased the apparent KD of [3H]QNB fivefold (from 0.07 nM to 0.32 nM) without decreasing Bmax. Verapamil was a less potent inhibitor of [3H]DHA binding and its effect was noncompetitive: the KD for DHA was unaltered by 100 microM verapamil while the Bmax decreased severalfold. We conclude that verapamil, at concentrations clinically achieved in the myocardium (approximately 1 microM), competitively inhibits binding to alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors and that this inhibition may play a role in the effects of verapamil on the heart.", 
    "21": "The cardiovascular properties of a new noncatechol, nonglycoside cardiotonic agent, MDL 17,043, were investigated in anesthetized and conscious dogs and the dog heart-lung preparation. MDL 17,043 (0.1-1 mg/kg), administered to anesthetized dogs by intravenous injection, produced dose-related increases in cardiac contractile force lasting more than 1 h. It also produced relatively minor and shorter-lasting increases in heart rate, and brief decreases in blood pressure. These effects were not blocked by propranolol. Of these effects, the increase in cardiac contractile force was, by far, the most prominent. the cardiac effects were also observed in the dog heart-lung preparation. When administered to anesthetized dogs by constant intravenous infusion, MDL 17,043 (09.03 and 0.1 mg/kg/min) produced a marked and sustained increase in cardiac contractile force and a sustained decrease in blood pressure without altering heart rate, suggesting a wide separation between the inotropic instrumented dogs, MDL 17,043 (3-30 mg/kg) produced a sustained increase in dP/dt without altering heart rate or blood pressure. It reversed the depressant effect of pentobarbital on the ventricular function curve in the dog heart-lung. When the hemodynamic characteristics of compensated heart failure were produced by propranolol in anesthetized dogs, MDL 17,043 reversed these effects. These studies suggest that MDL 17,043 may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "22": "We studied the hemodynamic effects of the new calcium antagonist tiapamil (Ro 11-1781) in anesthetized open-chest dogs and compared them with those of verapamil. Increasing doses of tiapamil injected intravenously caused the following hemodynamic effects: increase in coronary flow and decrease in coronary vascular resistance, followed by decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and total peripheral resistance. Tiapamil did not depress myocardial contractility over a rather wide dose range, while verapamil did. Tiapamil was more effective in increasing coronary flow than verapamil. Cardiac autonomic denervation did not modify the tiapamil-induced decrease in coronary vascular resistance and did not cause tiapamil to display negative inotropism. Both tiapamil and verapamil reduced the extent of S-T segment elevation in the epicardial electrocardiogram produced by transient occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Neither drug had this effect when heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing. In contrast to nitroglycerin, tiapamil dilated small but not large coronary arteries. Tiapamil raised PO2 relatively more in the subendocardial than in the subepicardial layers of the myocardium. The hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of tiapamil were not changed by diphenylhydantoin and disopyramide or by pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. However, the decreases in heart rate and blood pressure in response to propranolol were enhanced by tiapamil.", 
    "23": "AR-L115 BS is a phenyl-imidazo-pyridine derivative that combines positive inotropic and vasodilator properties. To analyze the mechanisms of action of AR-L115 in the presence or absence of heart failure, we administered it intravenously to conscious dogs (seven normals and eight with a volume-overload heart failure). In normals, at a plasma level around 1,000 ng/ml, AR-L115 BS increased left ventricular (LV) peak (+) dP/dt (+48%; p less than 0.02) and heart rate (+29 beats/min; p less than 0.05) without altering significantly cardiac filling pressures or cardiac output. The mean aortic pressure and the systemic vascular resistances (-20%; p less than 0.02) were reduced, but plasma renin activity (PRA) was unchanged. In heart failure, the same plasma level increased peak (+) dP/dt by 36% (p less than 0.01), but heart rate stayed unchanged. Mean aortic pressure, systemic vascular resistances (-20%; p less than 0.01), and LV end-diastolic pressure (-9.1 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) all dropped significantly, while cardiac output increased slightly; PRA did not rise significantly. After beta-blockade, the increases in peak (+) dP/dt and the changes in systemic vascular resistances were markedly reduced. In conclusion, AR-L115 BS has strong positive inotropic and vasodilator effects, both of which are partially dependent on the level of the sympathetic tone in the intact animal. These combined properties improve hemodynamics in heart failure; this improvement is already significant at relatively low plasma levels, at which deleterious changes in heart rate or PRA are absent.", 
    "24": "We studied the mode of action of a new cardiotonic agent (AR-L115) contractile performance of isolated cardiac muscle. We analyzed its effects on the contraction and relaxation of partially skinned, single cardiac cells of rat ventricle, and of intact papillary muscles of the right ventricle of the cat. AR-L115 (30-100 micrograms/ml) reversibly increased the frequency, but not the amplitude, of spontaneous isotonic and isometric contractions of the single cells with functioning sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), thereby resembling the action of caffeine. It did not affect contractions of mechanically skinned and detergent-pretreated cells without functioning SR, which were activated through iontophoretic calcium pulses. In papillary muscles, AR-L115 (1-40 micrograms/ml) significantly increased directly measured maximum unloaded velocity of shortening at zero load, peak velocity of isotonic shortening and lengthening, peak total isometric tension development, and peak rate of tension development, indicating augmented contractility. These effects were less pronounced than those of increasing the calcium concentration in the bathing solution from 2.5 to 7.5 mM. After beta-adrenergic blockade (propranolol or toliprolol 10(-5) M), the maximal effects of AR-L115 were markedly diminished. Load dependence of isotonic relaxation and the time of half-isometric relaxation were not affected by the drug. Accordingly, AR-L115 is a mild positive inotropic agent, which mainly increases contractility during the contraction phase without markedly affecting load dependence of relaxation. These effects are probably mediated both through a catecholaminelike action on beta-receptors and through a separate caffeinelike action on the calcium-sequestering membrane systems. In contrast to digitalis glycosides, AR-L115 does not exhibit tachyphylaxis in chronically AR-L115-loaded animals.", 
    "25": "To determine whether beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors have similar functions in salivary glands, Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically treated with either the beta 1-selective (prenalterol), beta 2-selective (terbutaline), or the nonselective beta-agonist isoproterenol. All three agonists increased parotid and submandibular gland weight and acinar cell size. Isoproterenol and prenalterol caused marked quantitative and qualitative alterations in the granule population, whereas terbutaline had no effect. A single injection of isoproterenol caused a significant amylase release and accumulation of cAMP. Prenalterol was as potent as isoproterenol with regard to amylase release but was without effect on the cAMP content. In contrast, terbutaline had a minimal effect on amylase release but had the same effect as isoproterenol on cAMP accumulation. The in vitro perifusion experiments confirmed these in vivo results with respect to the effects of the selective beta-agonists. Thus, the present investigation using both morphological and biochemical methods suggests that beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors may have different functions in rat parotid acinar cells. In addition, the stimulus-growth coupling seems to be unrelated to stimulus-secretion coupling.", 
    "26": "Pindolol is a new noncardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. In the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, pindolol provides effective control of blood pressure in a large majority of patients when administered alone or, more commonly, when combined with a thiazide diuretic. Pindolol is approximately as effective as propranolol in the therapy of hypertension, but in some crossover trials central nervous system side effects were more frequent with pindolol. A \"ceiling effect\" may be observed as dosages are titrated upward above approximately 20 to 30 mg per day, such that further blood pressure reductions may not be achievable. Some patients will exhibit a paradoxical increase in blood pressure with an increase in dosage. In patients who respond to modest doses of pindolol, twice or even once daily dosing is often adequate. This prolonged duration of hypotensive activity, while not suggested by the kinetics of this or similar drugs, is probably common to most beta blockers. Investigations in small numbers of patients with angina pectoris have reported variable but generally beneficial results with pindolol.", 
    "27": "Spontaneous activity responses to acetylcholine (ACh), adrenaline (A), noradrenaline (NA) and barium chloride as well as the effects of various autonomic drugs on effects of field stimulation of nerves and muscle cells of isolated pieces or strips of cauda epididymidis, vas deferens, ampulla ductus deferentis and prostate of dog were studied. The main results and conclusions are: the muscles show little spontaneous activity but rhythmicity can easily be produced by e.g. stimulating agonists. The muscles are contracted by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants. ACh has usually no or a very weak contractile effect in high concentrations. Muscles of young dogs are more sensitive to ACh. The excitatory innervation of the muscles is adrenergic and completely blocked by adrenergic neuron blockers as well as alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. Stimulation of adrenergic nerves leads to maximum response already at low frequencies (4-6 Hz). This response is very similar to that provoked by a supramaximal dose of NA. Scopolamine enhances neurogenic contractile effects while physostigmine suppresses them. Hence cholinergic nerves may act by muscarinic prejunctional inhibition of the excitatory adrenergic neurotransmission rather than act directly upon the smooth muscle cells. Since secretory cells receive cholinergic innervation prejunctional inhibition of the adrenergic myomotor nerves may be of functional significance in at least the long copulatory events of the dog.", 
    "28": "The effects of SGB-483, a newly-synthesized hypotensive agent, on the blood pressure were studied in unanesthetized and anesthetized rats. SGB-483 produced a significant hypotensive action in the conscious SHR and renal hypertensive (clipping) rats, and it caused reversal of the pressor response to adrenaline in the anesthetized Wistar-Imamichi rats, SHR, and clipping rats. In an isolated guinea pig aorta preparation, SGB-483 competitively inhibited the contractile response to phenylephrine with a pA2 value of 7.64 +/- 0.08. In pithed rats that were pretreated with beta-adrenoceptor blocker, the pressor effect of adrenaline (1 microgram/kg) was not completely blocked by either prazosin (1 mg/kg), an alpha 1-selective blocker, or yohimbine (1 mg/kg), an alpha 2-selective blocker. SGB-483 (1 mg/kg) had no effects on the prazosin-resistant part of the pressor effect of adrenaline, but significantly inhibited the yohimbine-resistant part. Clonidine-induced reversal of the tachycardia induced in the pithed rat by cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation was unaffected by SGB-483, indicating that SGB-483 is a selective antagonist of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor.", 
    "29": "The existing literature dealing with the phasic orienting response (OR) in schizophrenia, examining, for the most part, the skin conductance component (SCOR), reports conflicting results with divergent implications for the nature of the attentional dysfunction in these patients. The present authors have contributed to that literature and to its divergencies. The present report addresses this issue by applying a common set of response definitions and uniform statistical-analytic procedures to the previously gathered electrodermal data obtained independently in each author's laboratory. A total of 14 studies is involved, drawn from six laboratories in the U.S.A., the U.K., and West Germany. Collectively, these studies examine chronic and acute schizophrenics, males and females, those receiving neuroleptic drugs and those not receiving them, recording SCOR from either (or both) hands using a variety of instruments and somewhat differing instructions and conditions, to both auditory and visual stimuli of different intensities and rise-time properties. The authors' purpose is two-fold. First, to determine whether some 'universal' dysfunction can be demonstrated across laboratories, conditions, and samples. Given the heterogeneous origins of these data such a finding would offer fairly strong evidence of 'real' dysfunction in schizophrenia. Second, where disagreement exists, to describe the scope and nature of the disagreement, and to articulate more clearly the findings on each side of a disputed area. One such 'universal' dysfunction emerged. Consistently, schizophrenics displayed an abnormally high incidence of nonresponsiveness, involving nearly 50% of the schizophrenic sample on average. The next most common finding is that many of the schizophrenics who display an SCOR often habituate faster than do nonschizophrenic responders. This was seen in a majority of the studies and laboratories, but conflicting evidence was presented by a minority. Evidence for a dysfunction simultaneously involving SCOR hypo- and hyper-responsiveness within schizophrenia was obtained, but in a minority of studies. The possible effects of neuroleptic drugs, stimulus intensity and rise-time factors, and differential significance evaluation on these findings was discussed. The possibility that schizophrenic dysfunction involves the input-facilitating OR but not input-attenuating 'protective' responses is examined. The correlates of hyporesponsiveness in schizophrenia, including physiological response patterns, clinical symptom patterns, and specific input deficiencies, is also examined. Several areas are noted where systematic research has only begun, and further study is particularly needed.", 
    "30": "Forty children with presumed ventricular tachyarrhythmic syncopes in the absence of structural heart disease were studied. Twenty-nine patients, one of whom was deaf, had a prolonged QT-interval in the resting electrocardiogram (Group 1); eleven patients had a normal QT-interval (Group 2). The median QTc-interval vas 0.51 s in Group 1 and 0.40 s in Group 2. Familial occurrence suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance was found in 21 of 28 normally hearing patients in Group 1 and in 2 of 11 patients in Group 2. Syncopes were definitely stress-induced in 22 patients in Group 1 and in all 11 patients in Group 2. Of 23 patients in Group 1 in whom an electrocardiogram was obtained during physical exercise, only one showed severe ventricular dysrhythmia. In contrast, all eleven patients in Group 2 developed severe ventricular dysrhythmia with exercise. Treatment with beta-blocking medication prevented further syncopes in 15 of 19 patients with several previous attacks in Group 1 and in 3 of 5 patients of Group 2. Four of the 29 patients in Group 1 died suddenly and one more remained apallic after an attack. Of the 11 patients in Group 2, four died suddenly and one retains severe cerebral damage after resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. We conclude that, besides the group of patients with the long QT-syndrome, there may be a distinct group of patients with a consistently normal QT-interval and severe ventricular dysrhythmia with exercise. Patients of both groups are threatened by sudden death and are improved by treatment with beta-blocking medication.", 
    "31": "In 12 patients with systemic hypertension the cardiac stroke volume was determined simultaneously by the dye dilution technique and by impedence cardiography. The impedance stroke volume was calculated using Kubicek's formula (using four different values of blood resistivity) and also by the formula sv=AL delta z/Z0 (from the transthoracic impedance change, the delta z waveform). Significant correlations were found between the stroke volume measured by the impedance and reference methods and there were significant differences between the correlation coefficients (range 0.81-0.92) irrespective of which formula was used or which value of blood resistivity was inserted in the Kubicek formula. Only the delta z formula gave no significant differences for both the mean difference and the regression coefficient. Measurement of the stroke volume with the delta z formula requires breath holding, but determination of the systolic ejection time or blood resistivity is not necessary, unlike the Kubicek formula. A low peak value of dz/dt indicated a poor correlation with the dye dilution method, and also indicated a reduced maximum rate of ejection of blood from the heart. The effective delta z formula affords a different approach for future investigations of the genesis of the cardiac impedance changes in the thorax.", 
    "32": "The effect of i.v. ergonovine tartrate infusions (0.05-20 micrograms/kg/min, 12 minutes duration) on coronary arteries was studied in 14 conscious dogs instrumented to continuously measure vascular diameter by an ultrasonic dimension gauge using 10-MHz piezoelectric crystals. Ergonovine induced a biphasic coronary response: small, transient dilation during the first minutes of infusion, followed by slowly developing constriction reaching its maximum 5 to 15 minutes after the end of the infusion and persisting at this level for at least 10 minutes. The threshold dosage for significant constriction was 0.05 microgram/kg/min. A dosage of 5 micrograms/kg/min (cumulative 60 micrograms/kg, corresponding to 35 micrograms/kg ergonovine maleate) caused a decline in mean left circumflex artery diameter by 137 +/- 15 micrometers (= 4.6%) without significantly altering heart rate, plasma catecholamines or plasma renin activity. Coronary venous O2 saturation did not decline, indicating the absence of coronary resistance vessel constriction. The epicardial artery constriction was not attenuated by a vasopressin antagonist. Under adrenergic blockade (2 mg/kg phentolamine and 2 mg/kg nadolol) or under ganglionic blockade (5 mg/kg pentolinium tartrate), ergonovine (5 micrograms/kg /min) caused substantial elevation in mean arterial pressure, while the decline in coronary artery diameter was attenuated. When this increase in arterial pressure was prevented by appropriate bleeding, the ergonovine-induced coronary constriction was not diminished by adrenergic or ganglionic blockade. The serotonin antagonist methysergide (0.5 mg/kg) completely abolished the ergonovine-induced coronary artery vasomotion. It is concluded that ergonovine in dogs causes an epicardial coronary artery constriction comparable to the diffuse coronary artery narrowing in men not suffering from variant angina pectoris. These constrictions are not mediated by an adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "33": "The effect of propranolol, carazolol and acebutolol on the heart rate and blood pressure responses to intravenous adrenaline were examined in conscious Pietrain pigs. All three drugs blocked the tachycardia and vasodilatory responses to adrenaline and induced an increase in vasopressor responsiveness. The likely complications from using non-cardioselective beta blockers for preventing stress-induced deaths in pigs are discussed.", 
    "34": "After ingestion of beta-blocking agents 20 out of 77 children and adolescents developed clinical symptoms. 11 cases resulted from suicidal attempts. A 15 year old girl died. Neurological signs (12) predominated. Cardiovascular signs (10) were especially seen after suicidal ingestion of beta-blocking agents. Infants frequently showed hypoglycemia or symptoms based on hypoglycemia (6). After elimination from the gastrointestinal tract patients require intensive monitoring as well as symptomatic treatment. Treatment with atropin often gave insufficient results. However, treatment with glucagon was successful. Secondary detoxication generally is not required and must be evaluated after pharmacokinetic data. Forced diuresis is not indicated.", 
    "35": "One-minute oscillations of the infraslow activity were recorded within the range of 0 to 1 Hz with indwelled electrodes in the rabbit hippocampus. The oscillations disappeared for 5-hour period after L-DOPA administration. The phenomenon could be prevented with ethimisol. A correlation was found between the amplitude of the infraslow oscillations and the temperature of the dorsal hippocampus in different states of the c. n. s. induced by catecholaminergic serotoninergic and cholinergic neurotropic substances.", 
    "36": "The acute effect of non-selective beta-blockade alone (propranolol) or in combination with alpha-blockade (labetalol) and beta 1-selective blockade (practolol) on the airways was studied in 14 asthmatic patients. Severe bronchoconstriction was not seen in any patient after placebo (saline) or practolol (10 mg i.v.) while pronounced bronchoconstriction was seen in three patients after labetalol (20 mg i.v.) and in six patients after propranolol (5 mg i.v.). The effects of 2 weeks of oral medication with labetalol (200 mg x 2) and placebo were studied in the same patients. Four patients had symptoms of asthma during the labetalol period while none had asthmatic symptoms during the placebo period. The results suggest that coexistent alpha-adrenoceptor blockade fails to prevent asthmatic symptoms caused by beta-blockade.", 
    "37": "The unconditioned inhibition of feeding in a novel setting (hyponeophagia) was reduced by propranolol and another potentially centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, pindolol but not by a peripherally acting one, atenolol. A similar attenuation of hyponeophagia was seen following the 5-HT antagonist methysergide but no consistent effects were observed following some dopamine antagonist drugs. 5-Methoxy N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT), a compound with central 5-HT agonist properties, consistently potentiated hyponeophagia, an effect which was reversed by the centrally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and by methysergide. The results are interpreted as evidence for a 5-HT mediation of hyponeophagia and for a probable central 5-HT antagonist role for propranolol and pindolol.", 
    "38": "We have studied the lateral mobility and distribution of beta receptors on Chang human liver cells by fluorescence photobleaching recovery and video intensification microscopy. The beta receptors were labeled with the fluorescent antagonist 7-(2-allylphenoxy)-2,2-dimethyl-6-hydroxy-1-(4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazolyl)-1 ,4-diazaheptane (Alp-NBD). Sixty to 75% of the staining was specific (displaceable by unlabeled antagonists). Most of the antagonist-occupied beta receptors were immobile, because only 15-25% of their fluorescence recovered on the experimental time scale at 23 degrees C. This immobility correlates with the clustered distribution of Alp-NBD--beta-receptor complexes at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C. The beta receptors appear to be aggregated prior to antagonist binding, because visible patches were observed immediately after labeling for 30 sec at 4 degrees C. Preincubation at 37 degrees C with (--)-isoproterenol, a beta agonist, prior to Alp-NBD labeling induced a time-dependent release of the beta receptors to a more homogeneous distribution and increased the mobile fraction to 70-80% (lateral diffusion coefficient = 1.4 X 10(-9) cm2/sec at 23 degrees C). This is not due to an effect on membrane fluidity, because the diffusion coefficient of a lipid probe was not altered. The time course of agonist-induced beta-receptor mobilization correlates with receptor loss and adenylate cyclase desensitization but is much slower than adenylate cyclase activation. This indicates that adenylate cyclase activation by beta receptors does not require macroscopic lateral mobility of the majority of the beta receptors.", 
    "39": "Cimetidine has been reported to decrease the biotransformation of drugs metabolized by the MFOE system. Additionally, cimetidine decreases liver blood flow and increases the bioavailability of drugs with high hepatic extraction ratios. Patients receiving cimetidine in conjunction with drugs known to interact with cimetidine in conjunction with drugs known to interact with cimetidine are at risk of experiencing toxicity. When appropriate, reducing the dosage of these agents or switching to an alternative drug will minimize the incidence of side effects. Clinicians should be suspicious if patients experience exaggerated drug effects when cimetidine therapy is begun.", 
    "40": "1 Prizidilol hydrochloride (SK&F 92657) is a new compound which causes both arteriolar dilatation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The effect of a single oral dose on the responses of heart rate and blood pressure to isoprenaline infusion has been studied in healthy volunteers. 2 Isoprenaline heart rate dose-response curves showed parallel shifts to the right after oral prizidilol, indicating antagonism by this compound at beta-adrenoceptors in the heart. 3 Isoprenaline dose-response curves for decreases in diastolic blood pressure also showed shifts to the right after oral prizidilol, providing evidence of beta-adrenoceptor antagonism by this drug in peripheral resistance vessels. 4 The peak effect of a 40 mg dose of propranolol was greater than that of a 200 mg dose of prizidilol but both drugs caused persistent beta-adrenoceptor blockade for at least 7 h after ingestion.", 
    "41": "Cardiovascular interactions between dopamine and hypoxia were examined in 8 anesthetized, paralyzed dogs ventilated at constant rates. Total and hindlimb (less paw) O2 uptake, blood flow, and vascular resistance were measured with and without dopamine infusion of 10 micrograms/kg . min during both normoxic and hypoxic ventilation. Another 8 dogs were similarly treated after beta-blockade with propranolol infusion (1 mg/kg). During the baseline period, normoxic dopamine significantly increased total O2 uptake, cardiac output, and stroke volume, and significantly decreased total vascular resistance in the control group. Hypoxia decreased total O2 uptake, cardiac output, and heart rate but increased total vascular resistance. Dopamine reversed each of these hypoxic changes and restored total O2 uptake to normoxic levels. Hindlimb measurements were not significantly changed by dopamine or hypoxia in the control group. During hypoxia, beta-blockade abolished dopamine's effects except for the decrease in total vascular resistance. The improvement in cardiac output and O2 transport by dopamine infusion resulted from increased stroke volume during normoxia and from increased heart rate during hypoxia.", 
    "42": "It has recently been reported that the Beta-adrenergic receptor-blocker acebutolol accelerates the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in hypertensive patients. We examined data from over 1500 hypertensive patients to determine whether this effect is associated with other beta blockers. Groups of patients treated with acebutolol, atenolol, labetalol, and pindolol all displayed increased development of ANAs relative to patients on other medication. When patients taking methyldopa (a drug associated with a high ANA incidence) were excluded from the analysis, only acebutolol retained an association (P less than 0.001) with ANA production. Sequential studies to assess the development of ANAs in patients during the course of beta-blocker treatment revealed a similar pattern. With methyldopa patients excluded, the fraction of patients developing ANAs was less then 10% for all but atenolol (10.9%), labetalol (13.8%), and acebutolol (33%). Thus, although some of the beta blockers may be associated with an increase in ANA incidence, the dramatic effects of acebutolol do not appear to be a group property.", 
    "43": "Various cardiovascular drugs such as nitrates and propranolol, used in the treatment of coronary artery disease have been shown to have an antiplatelet effect. We have studied the in vitro effects of two antiarrhythmic drugs, verapamil and disopyramide, and have shown their inhibitory effect on platelet function. Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, inhibited the second phase of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate (*ADP) and inhibited aggregation induced by collagen. Disopyramide similarly inhibited the second phase of platelet aggregation caused by ADP and aggregation induced by collagen. Either drug in synergism with propranolol inhibited ADP or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. Disopyramide at high concentrations inhibited arachidonic acid whereas verapamil was without effect. Verapamil, but not disopyramide, inhibited aggregated induced by the ionophore A23187.", 
    "44": "A 20-year-old woman, admitted to an intensive care unit in ventricular fibrillation, had marked QT prolongation in the ECG after successful defibrillation. Family study revealed ECG signs of QT prolongation, as seen in the Romano-Ward syndrome, in four generations. Syncopal attacks only occurred in the third generation, affecting four siblings. In the described patient the intraventricular ECG revealed additional depolarizations (after-potentials) during and following repolarization (ST-T) in the surface ECG. The patient died later as a result of irreversible hypoxic cerebral damage. Invasive ECG studies in the mother also revealed after-potentials. In the patient, morbid-anatomical examination revealed, in addition to fibrosis and lipomatosis around the sinus and AV nodes, focal round-cell ganglionitis in both sympathetic trunks, but predominantly on the right. These infiltrations have not previously been described in this disease and could be of significance in the pathogenesis of the prolonged QT syndrome.", 
    "45": "The adenylate cyclase of cultured differentiated RL-PR-C hepatocytes is desensitized to 1-isoproterenol by exposure to this beta-agonist. Virtually complete desensitization occurred by 60 min (intact cells) or 30 min (isolated plasma membranes). Isoproterenol was maximally effective at 10 micrometers, although substantial desensitization occurred at isoproterenol concentrations as low as 10 nM. Protein synthesis was not required for desensitization. Recovery from desensitization under tissue culture conditions was only 25% complete by 24 h. Maximum desensitization was accompanied by only a modest 35% decrease in binding sites (as determined by binding assays with [3H]dihydroalprenolol), with no change in binding affinity. Adenylate cyclase desensitized to 1-isoproterenol responded normally to guanine nucleotides and to fluoride, suggesting that the regulatory and catalytic proteins were not the sites of the desensitization \"defect'. Using N-ethylmaleiimide to inactive the regulatory and catalytic proteins, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to inactivate the beta-adrenergic receptor, of intact hepatocytes, various heterologous cell fusion hybrids were produced, and their adenylate cyclases tested for responsiveness to 1-isoproterenol; only hybrids containing \"desensitized' receptor failed to respond to isoproterenol. These results suggest that the mechanism of desensitization to isoproterenol involves only the receptor component of the receptor-regulatory protein(s)-adenylate cyclase complex, and that the receptors are reduced in number and/or ability to interact with the regulatory protein as a result of the desensitization process.", 
    "46": "Acute poisoning with beta adrenergic inhibitors is rare although such drugs are widely prescribed. Between 1966 and 1980, 40 cases were recorded at the Fernand-Widal Toxicology Center. 40% of patients were asymptomatic and 25% had sinus bradycardia. 35% of patients had specific toxic signs, either atrioventricular block (20%) or hemodynamic disorders (15%); the latter were seen only when associated heart disease was present or when another cardiotropic agent had been absorbed. No deaths were recorded. This favorable prognosis may result from the self-limited nature of poisoning with beta blocking agents, myocardial function being similar to that which follows denervation. In severe cases, management includes pacing and glucagon.", 
    "47": "Isoprenaline given to rats in doses between 0.08 and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally caused a significant decrease in plasma concentrations of tyrosine and tryptophan. Low doses of adrenaline (0.04 - 0.16 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) caused a 30 per cent decrease in plasma concentrations of tyrosine, while high doses (0.63 - 1.25 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) caused an increase in plasma tyrosine to nearly 200 per cent of the controls. High doses of noradrenaline (0.63 - 2.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) caused a similar increase in plasma tyrosine concentration. The decrease in plasma amino acids caused by these catecholamines is inhibited by propranolol, suggesting that this effect is mediated via adrenergic beta-receptors, while the increasing effect is inhibited by phenoxybenzamine, which suggests that this effect is caused by an alpha-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "48": "The present study examines the role of brain networks of noradrenaline (NA) in the control of pituitary secretion of beta-endorphin into systemic plasma. The blocker of NA synthesis, FLA-63, elicited a pronounced elevation in levels of beta-endorphin immunoreactivity (beta-EI) in systemic plasma and depleted the anterior but not the neurointermediate lobe content of beta-EI. This finding suggests the existence of a noradrenergic mechanism tonically inhibiting the secretion of adenohypophyseal pools of beta-EI into plasma. Selective destruction of the ventral noradrenergic bundle diminished the NA content of the hypothalamus but not the cortex, and produced an increase in plasma levels of beta-EI. Lesions of the locus coeruleus, the primary origin of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle, in contrast, decreased NA levels in the cortex but not the hypothalamus and failed to modify beta-EI levels in plasma. the ventral bundle may, thus, via a hypothalamic site of action, be the noradrenergic pathway inhibiting the secretion of beta-EI into the circulation.", 
    "49": "The action of chronic morphine administration on catecholamine levels in the cervical (SCG) and iris of the rat pup was studied by radioenzymatic assay. Catecholamine levels in the SCG and iris were unaltered after chronic morphine administration and withdrawal. Norepinephrine (NE) uptake was unchanged throughout drug treatment. beta-adrenergic receptors were increased 30.8% in the iris of morphine-dependent animals. This increase in beta receptors closely parallels the increase in beta receptors found in the brainstem of adult morphine-dependent animals.", 
    "50": "In the present report we analyzed the long-term effect of neonatal noradrenergic denervation on the regulation of paradoxical sleep in the rat. The locus coeruleus was destroyed bilaterally at 4 days of age by direct infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine into the nuclei. After they reached adulthood, the rats received either i.p. injections of a beta-blocker, propranolol, or the same treatment combined with intraventricular infusion of a beta-agonist, isoproterenol. Several doses of each drug were tested. The effects of propranolol, alone and together with isoproterenol, on paradoxical sleep (a decrease for the former drug and a restoration for the latter combination) were significantly more pronounced in the lesioned group than in age-paired controls. These data illustrate a functional aspect of the denervation supersensitivity phenomenon in beta-receptors.", 
    "51": "Captopril and propranolol were given alone and in combination to 13 hypertensive men and the effects studied at rest (seated, supine and standing) and during exercise. The two drugs were equipotent at rest, and individual patients showed similar blood pressure responses to the two drugs. Both produced slight reduction of urinary aldosterone; when given in combination, both blood pressure and aldosterone were further reduced. During exercise the increase in blood pressure was unaffected by captopril but reduced by propranolol, and there was no correlation between individual responses to the two drugs. It is concluded that the similar effects of the two drugs on resting blood pressure are consistent with their effects on the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "52": "Twenty severely hypertensive subjects who did not achieve blood pressure control with combination therapy with a vasodilator, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent and a diuretic received the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Marked decreases in blood pressure were observed immediately. Achievement of sustained reductions in blood pressure into the normal range for up to 3 years of follow-up required the addition of a diuretic in all patients and of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in half. As expected, significant increases in plasma renin activity and decreases in plasma aldosterone were seen initially and sustained throughout the study. Plasma and urinary norepinephrine levels, which were markedly increased before captopril treatment, decreased significantly and remained low for the duration of study. These observations suggest a link between the renal pressor and sympathetic systems which may be involved in the pathophysiology of severe, treatment-resistant hypertension, and suggest that part of the antihypertensive action of captopril may be related to a decrease in sympathetic activity secondary to its interference with the generation of angiotensin II.", 
    "53": "Thirty-three patients aged 12 to 77 years with severe hypertension uncontrolled on maximal combination therapy (mean arterial pressure on treatment 149 +/- 4 mm Hg) were treated with captopril, 45 to 450 mg daily for up to 30 months. Renovascular lesions were present in 11 and other renal disease in a further 15, of whom 8 had undergone renal transplantation. Good control (mean blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg) was achieved in 11 patients and moderate control (mean blood pressure 110 to 130 mm Hg) in 13. Captopril was given with a diuretic agent in 13 patients, with a diuretic agent and a beta-adrenoreceptor blocker in 13, and with three or more other agents in 7, of whom 4 had undergone renal transplantation. Side effects of rash, fever and gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, but there were no adverse effects on renal function or leukocyte counts. Severe hyperkalemia (potassium level greater than 6.0 mmol/liter) occurred in four patients despite the use of furosemide and low potassium diet. There was no significant correlation between the long-term hypotensive response and the initial decrease in blood pressure during captopril therapy.", 
    "54": "There is no general agreement on the relation between the hypotensive effect of captopril and the pretreatment plasma renin levels of hypertensive patients. To determine whether the hypotensive effect of captopril was directly related to plasma renin, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was administered acutely to 10 essential hypertensive patients with normal or suppressed plasma renin activity before and after inhibition of renin secretion with propranolol. Captopril was equally effective in reducing blood pressure both when administered alone (25 mg: -29/-17; 50 mg: -37/-23 mm Hg) and after chronic treatment with propranolol (25 mg: -33/-20; 50 mg: -30/-20 mm Hg). The increase in renin induced by captopril was not decreased by propranolol therapy. The persistence of the hypotensive effect of captopril after renin suppression by propranolol suggests that this drug has some blood pressure decreasing properties independent of plasma renin.", 
    "55": "A randomised controlled crossover trial was performed to assess the anti-anginal effects of nifedipine and propranolol separately and together. The effects of these treatments on blood pressure and heart rate were assessed at rest and after the cold pressor and mental arithmetic tests. Nifedipine and propranolol together produced the greatest reduction in supine and erect systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Propranolol (480 mg daily) lowered resting systolic/diastolic blood pressures by 7/6 mm Hg and nifedipine (60 mg daily) lowered it by 10/8 mm Hg, while in the erect position the hypotensive effect of these agents averaged 9/8 mm Hg. During the cold pressor test propranolol lowered the maximum pressure by an average of 11/6 mm Hg and nifedipine by 19/10 mm Hg. For the mental arithmetic test, the results were 7/2 mm Hg and 16/7 mm Hg respectively. Propranolol (480 mg daily)reduced supine and erect heart rate by 19 and 25 beats/minute respectively, while nifedipine did not alter heart rate significantly. The favourable haemodynamic responses to nifedipine suggest that it may be of value in the management of hypertension.", 
    "56": "The mechanisms of the changes in plasma lipids concentrations observed after beta-blockade were examined in 53 patients with hypertension receiving treatment with atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, and oxprenolol in a randomised cross-over trial. Significant increases in mean plasma total and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride and reductions in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and free fatty acids concentrations wer observed with all four drugs, the increase in plasma triglyceride concentration being greatest after propranolol and oxprenolol. No significant changes were observed in total of LDL cholesterol concentrations, but HDL:LDL ratios and HDL cholesterol as a proportion of total cholesterol fell significantly. Thus plasma lipid concentrations should be monitored after three to six months of long-term treatment. Changes in triglyceride, HDL cholesterol and free fatty acid concentrations were associated with a highly significant reduction in clearance of soya oil (Intralipid) in 25 patients studied but were unrelated to changes in blood pressure. The fall in HDL cholesterol and rise in free fatty acid concentrations were significantly less in those with initially reduced HDL cholesterol or raised free fatty acid concentrations respectively. It is proposed that unopposed alpha stimulation inhibits lipoprotein lipase with a subsequent rise in plasma triglyceride and fall in HDL cholesterol concentration. Analysis of the relation between pretreatment concentrations and subsequent changes suggests that excessive alpha stimulation may impair production of HDL cholesterol in those with low HDL cholesterol concentrations before treatment. Subtle catecholamine-mediated changes in plasma lipid concentrations might provide a mechanism for the relation between stress and the development of cardiovascular events.", 
    "57": "126 patients with blood pressure which was unacceptably high despite a conventional stepped-care regimen (diuretic, beta-blocker, and vasodilator) took part in a comparative assessment of different approaches to the treatment of refractory hypertension. One of four regimens was used: oral diazoxide, minoxidil, captopril, or quadruple therapy (diuretic + beta-adrenoceptor blocker + hydralazine + prazosin). Despite the severity of hypertension, blood pressure could be controlled in almost all these patients, and no patient died from cerebrovascular disease while on treatment. 2 patients died of renal failure and 5 patients required long-term haemodialysis. Ischaemic heart disease remained a problem and caused the death of 10 patients. Diazoxide was the most effective treatment but was the most difficult and unpleasant to use. Captopril was the best-tolerated but failed to control blood pressure in 6 of 15 patients. Our experience indicates that there are now sufficient therapeutic alternatives to achieve acceptable blood-pressure control in almost all patients with \"refractory\" hypertension, although no treatment is ideal.", 
    "58": "A sensitive and selective method for the quantitative analysis of prenalterol in plasma and urine is described. Prenalterol and the internal standard, deuterated prenalterol, are extracted with diethyl ether at pH 9.9 under salting-out conditions. Derivatization is performed by means of pentafluoropropionic anhydride in toluene before separation in the gas chromatograph. Detection and quantification of the triacyl derivatives are done by mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode. The method allows determination of concentrations down to 5 nmol/l (1 ng/ml) in 1 ml of sample, with a relative standard deviation below 10%.", 
    "59": "The haemodynamic effects of a 14-day treatment regimen with 100 mg metoprolol daily were tested on 20 male hypertensives at rest and on exercise. Resting blood pressure had been reduced to comparable normal values with a reserpine combination drug in the control period. With metoprolol the exercise blood pressures were significantly lower than at rest (197/102 mm Hg and 230/109 mm Hg, respectively: P less than 0.001). The product of pressure and heart rate at rest and during exercise was lower (P less than 0.001). On the other hand, in 15 patients the pulmonary wedge pressure rose from 15.6 +/- 4.6 mm Hg to 31.4 +/- 5.4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). The wedge pressure correlated closely (P less than 0.001) with changes in cardiac index.", 
    "60": "The influence of propranolol on GABA-stimulated [3H]diazepam binding in the rat cerebral cortex was investigated. Maximum potentiation of GABA-stimulated binding (20.6 +/- 4.5%, P less than 0.05) was observed at 100 microM propranolol, whilst maximum inhibition (32.5 +/- 2.5%, P less than 0.01) was observed at 1 nM propranolol. Low concentrations (1 nM) of (+)-propranolol were observed to be equipotent with (+/-)-propranolol in shifting the dose-response curve of GABA-stimulated [3H]diazepam binding by approximately 1/2 log unit. The phenomenon does not therefore show the stereospecificity observed towards either beta-adrenergic receptors or 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.", 
    "61": "The anti-arrhythmic effectiveness of propafenon (3 x 150 mg daily) combined with propranolol (3 x 20 mg daily) was compared with that of each drug alone in 15 patients with stable ventricular and (or) supraventricular extrasystoles. The frequency of extrasystoles decreased on propafenon alone by 70% (P less than 0.05), without further decrease on additional propranolol administration. Propranolol alone on average caused no significant decrease infrequency (35%). The most important ECG changes with the combined treatment consisted of a definite increase in P-Q interval by an average of 25% (P less than 0.01) while with propafenon alone it was 13%, with propranolol alone 19% . Propafenon plus propranolol decreased heart rate by a mean of 17% (P less than 0.01). The additive effect of both substances can lead to an inhibition of atrioventricular conduction and of sinus node function."
