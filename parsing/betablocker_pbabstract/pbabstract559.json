    "0": "Plasma lipoproteins were estimated in ten hypertensive subjects (mean age 51 +/- 11.2 yr), before, 6 wk and 6 mth following treatment with Sotalol 320 mg/day. Heart rate fell sequentially throughout the study (p less than 0.01) and although there was a sequential fall in mean blood pressure this did not reach statistical significance. There was a significant increase in plasma triglyceride concentration from a basal value of 1.87 +/- 1.064 to 2.50 +/- 0.877 mmol/l (p less than 0.005) at 6 mth. No significant change was found in very low density, low density and high density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoprotein concentrations (Apo A-I, Apo A-II, Apo B). We conclude that Sotalol exerts a similar influence on plasma lipoproteins as other non-cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and its use does not constitute an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, when compared with other beta-blockers.", 
    "1": "The action of beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol, exprenolol, metoprolol, sotalol, atenolol, timolol) and calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) on the electrical properties and fluidity of bilayer lipid membranes (BLM and liposomes) has been investigated. When antibiotic ionophore substances were used as a probe, the electrical measurements showed that many of the drugs inhibited the cation transport across the membrane facilitated by the mobile carrier valinomycin, while having no significant effect on the cation transport through channels formed by gramicidin. The ability of the drugs to decrease the carrier-dependent membrane conductance was correlated to their partition into the lipid bilayer and the magnitude of transmembrane potential induced by them. In the TEMPO ESR spectral measurements, a number of beta-adrenergic and calcium blockers showed the fluidizing effect on liposomes composed of different lipids. The drug concentration required for a detectable change in TEMPO spectra parameter (f) was rather high (0.01 M verapamil), and the variation of pH from 6.5 to 3.0 did not affect the fluidizing effect of the drugs.", 
    "2": "Fifty black (Zulu) men, aged 20-60 years, with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension participated in a double-blind randomized parallel-group study lasting 12 weeks. Study drugs were acebutolol 200 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (Secadrex; Maybaker) (SDX) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (HCT) given as a single tablet once daily under supervision. Following a 4-week washout period and after protocol exclusions and withdrawals, a total of 37 patients took the active preparations for 6 weeks, 33 for 7 weeks and 32 for 8 weeks. Of 17 patients treated with SDX, 16 responded satisfactorily; 20 patients were treated with HCT and 18 responded satisfactorily. No important biochemical or haematological changes occurred and no serious adverse reactions were noted. Mild-to-moderate essential hypertension was effectively controlled in a significant proportion of both treatment groups.", 
    "3": "The pharmacokinetics and dynamics of the D- and L-isomers of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent penbutolol were investigated in healthy human volunteers. In Study One, subjects received a single 40-mg oral dose of L-penbutolol (the pharmacologically active stereoisomer), and matching placebo on two occasions. A mean peak serum penbutolol concentration of 268 ng/ml was reached at 0.9 h after dosing. Elimination half-life averaged 1.6 h, and total clearance 16.6 ml/min per kg body weight. Changes in blood pressure, ventricular rate, and rate of circumferential fiber shortening (Vcf) did not differ between L-penbutolol and placebo. In Study Two, subjects received 40 mg D-penbutolol, L-penbutolol, and placebo on three occasions. Total clearance of D-penbutolol was higher than for the L-isomer (43.7 vs 15.9 ml/min/kg; P less than 0.01); this was reflected in correspondingly increased area under the serum concentration curve for conjugates of the oxidized metabolite 4-hydroxy penbutolol (2.25 vs 0.66 micrograms/ml X h; P less than 0.005). In contrast, direct conjugates of L-penbutolol achieved higher serum concentrations than conjugates of D-penbutolol. Alterations in blood pressure, ventricular rate, and Vcf for D-penbutolol, L-penbutolol, and placebo were quantitatively small. Thus the clearance of penbutolol after oral administration in humans is stereoselective, but the oxidative pathway is more stereosensitive than the parallel conjugative pathway. Penbutolol causes minimal alterations in parameters of cardiac function after single 40-mg doses in healthy humans.", 
    "4": "12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells resulted in an increased incorporation of 32Pi and [methyl-3H]choline into choline-containing phosphoglycerides (PC). In pulse-chase experiments, TPA treatment caused an increased release of [methyl-3H]choline from the PC fraction of prelabeled cells. When cells were prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]palmitic acid, TPA treatment resulted in an increased synthesis of 14C, 3H-diglycerides. Further studies were done to determine the relationship between PC breakdown and diglyceride synthesis. Cells were preincubated with ether-linked 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine which was acylated to form 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Subsequent treatment of these cells with TPA resulted in an increased synthesis of 1-O-[3H]hexadecyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol compared to cells not stimulated with TPA. These findings demonstrate that TPA stimulates PC turnover in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and provide evidence for a novel mechanism of diglyceride formation.", 
    "5": "Adrenalectomy results in significant changes in the mechanism of adrenergic activation of hepatic glycogenolysis. In adrenalectomized rats a greater role for the beta-adrenergic receptor is observed, whereas the alpha 1-adrenergic-mediated phosphorylase activation declines. Our present findings document that adrenalectomy causes a significant decrease in the high-affinity population of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor labelled with [3H]adrenaline. Our data indicate a large increase in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites after adrenalectomy. This increase was not consistent with the observed modest increase in the beta-adrenergic-mediated activation of cyclic AMP accumulation and glycogen phosphorylase. When alpha-adrenergic antagonists are present along with the catecholamine, a 100% increase in the adrenaline-mediated accumulation of cyclic AMP in hepatocytes from adrenalectomized rats was observed. Adrenalectomy was also shown to cause a significant increase in the hepatic alpha 2-adrenergic binding sites. These data are consistent with an inhibitory role on the beta-adrenergic-mediated activation of glycogenolysis by the hepatic alpha 2-adrenergic receptor in adrenalectomy.", 
    "6": "The effects of ageing on vascular alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors were examined using anaesthetised and pithed young (3-7 months) and old (21-24 months) Sprague-Dawley rats. In pithed animals, the pressor and cardioinhibitory effects of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine were significantly reduced in old animals (8- and 6-fold shift), but the pressor effects of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist amidephrine were not significantly altered by ageing. In anaesthetised rats, the pressor response to the mixed alpha-adrenoceptor agonist noradrenaline (NA) was not significantly altered, and the pressor potency of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist amidephrine was only slightly reduced (1.7-fold shift) in old animals. In the presence of cocaine (1 mg kg-1) the pressor potency of NA was markedly reduced (13-fold shift) in old animals. In the presence of prazosin (1 mg kg-1) to eliminate alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, the pressor potency of NA was markedly reduced in old as animals as compared to young animals (16-fold shift). The neuronal uptake blocker cocaine (1 mg kg-1) significantly potentiated the pressor response to NA only in young. In summary, we have found a reduced alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor and cardioinhibitory responsiveness and a reduced neuronal uptake of NA in old animals with little change in alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated vascular responsiveness.", 
    "7": "The daily water intake was reduced in rats by subcutaneous administration of propranolol. The fluid intake after 24 h of dehydration in nephrectomized animals was decreased by propranolol. In intact rats diazepam did not modify the postdehydration water intake. Propranolol injected into subfornical organ decreased water consumption after 24 h of fluid deprivation but did not change the dipsogenic response to carbachol given in the same structure. These results suggest that a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism participates in the regulation of the daily water intake. After a stimulus such as dehydration, beta-blockade modifies water consumption by a non-renal mechanism. This mechanism involves neither a general depressant nervous activity nor a local anesthetic action and could be located in a periventricular structure, the subfornical organ.", 
    "8": "Intravenous infusions of 0.01-0.1 mg X kg-1 X min-1 of pimobendan, a benzimidazole-pyridazinone derivative in pigs with normal coronary circulation caused dose-dependent changes in heart rate (10-35%), left ventricular systolic pressure (-5 to -45%), left ventricular filling pressure (-20 to -40%) but had only a minor effect on the maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (max LVdP/dt; 10-20%). The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was primarily due to systemic vasodilation; peripheral resistance and cardiac output decreased by up to 40 and 14%, respectively. Vasodilation occurred in several vascular beds, but was particularly pronounced in the adrenals, stomach, small intestine and myocardium. Although the increase in myocardial blood flow favoured the epicardium, vascular conductance in both the endo- and epicardial layers was significantly increased. Myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2) was not affected despite the increase in heart rate. Bolus injections of 0.1-0.5 mg X kg-1 pimobendan produced similar changes in all haemodynamic variables, except max LVdP/dt which now increased by 30-70%. As in the infusion experiments, cardiac output tended to decrease due to a pronounced reduction in ventricular preload probably as a result of venodilation and the consequent reduction in cardiac filling. However, in animals where max LVdP/dt and cardiac output were reduced and pre- and/or after-load were increased by partial occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, pimobendan clearly increased both max LVdP/dt and cardiac output. Pretreatment with propranolol did not modify any of the cardiovascular responses to pimobendan, thereby excluding the involvement of a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism. Pimobendan is thus a compound with vasodilator and positive inotropic properties that improves cardiac output in animals with severe myocardial ischaemia. The finding that the mild tachycardia caused by pimobendan was not accompanied by an increase in MVO2 warrants investigation to evaluate its usefulness in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "9": "The long term effect of beta blockers and the influence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity on respiratory function were assessed in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris randomised to receive treatment with propranolol (n = 21) or pindolol (n = 19) for one year. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) had fallen by a mean of 240 ml after one year (p less than 0.001) in those treated with propranolol compared with 120 ml in those treated with pindolol (p less than 0.05). The difference between the groups was significant (p less than 0.01). Vital capacity fell significantly only in those treated with propranolol (p less than 0.05 at one year). In those in whom the basal ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was low (less than 70%) propranolol, but not pindolol, caused a significant (p less than 0.05) fall in FEV1 throughout treatment. Long term administration of pindolol has a less adverse effect on respiratory function than propranolol, which results in a progressive deterioration in respiratory function over one year.", 
    "10": "Between mid-1981 and Jan 1, 1985, 16 027 patients entering 245 coronary care units at a mean of 5.0 h after the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction were randomised either to a control group or to a group receiving atenolol (5-10 mg iv immediately, followed by 100 mg/day orally for 7 days). Vascular mortality during the treatment period (days 0-7) was significantly lower (2p less than 0.4) in the treated group, 313/8037 (3.89%) versus 365/7990 (4.57%), but this 15% difference has wide 95% confidence limits (from about zero to about a quarter). No subgroups were identified in which the proportional difference in days 0-7 was clearly better, or clearly worse, than 15%. After the treatment period, there was only a slight further divergence (691 vs 703 additional vascular deaths by Jan 1, 1985). Thus, overall vascular mortality was significantly lower in the atenolol group at one year (life-table estimates: 10.7% atenolol vs 12.0% control; 2p less than 0.01) but not at Jan 1, 1985 (crude percentages: 12.5% vs 13.4%; 2p less than 0.07). However, atenolol patients were more likely than controls to be discharged on beta-blockers, which can account for much of the additional difference in vascular mortality after day 7. Immediate beta-blockade increased the extent of inotropic drug use (5.0% vs 3.4%, 2p less than 0.0001), chiefly on days 0-1, but despite this most of the improvement in vascular mortality was seen during days 0-1 (121 vs 171 deaths). Treatment did not appear to decrease the number in whom cardiac enzymes rose to above twice the local upper limit of normal. Slightly fewer non-fatal cardiac arrests (189 vs 198) and reinfarctions (148 vs 161) were recorded in the atenolol group, neither difference being significant. Systematic review of fatal and of non-fatal events in ISIS-1 and in all other randomised trials of iv beta-blockade reinforces the suggestion that treatment reduces mortality in the first week by about 15%, but with a rather less extreme effect in days 0-1 than was observed in ISIS-1 alone. It also provides highly significant (2p less than 0.0002) evidence of an effect on the combined end-point of death, arrest, or reinfarction, suggesting that treatment of about 200 patients would lead to the avoidance of 1 reinfarction, 1 arrest, and 1 death during days 0-7. ISIS-1 suggests these early gains will persist.", 
    "11": "The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol inhibited the glycogenolytic response of platelet-activating factor (AGEPC, 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) in perfused livers derived from fed rats. AGEPC-stimulated hepatic vasoconstriction, measured by increases in portal vein pressure, also was inhibited by prior isoproterenol infusion. Isoproterenol-mediated inhibition of these hepatic responses to AGEPC was not apparent when isoproterenol (10 microM) was coinfused with the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol (75 microM) or when isoproterenol was replaced with the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (10 microM). alpha-Agonist-induced glycogenolysis and vasoconstriction in the perfused liver was unaffected by isoproterenol infusion. Glucagon (2.3 nM) had no effect on the glycogenolytic or vasoconstrictive responses of the liver to AGEPC despite the fact that glucagon increased hepatic cAMP levels to a far greater extent than isoproterenol. Additionally, inhibition of the hepatic responses to AGEPC by isoproterenol occurred in perfused livers from mature rats (i.e. greater than 300 g) in which liver parenchymal cells lack functional beta-adrenergic receptors. The data presented in this study illustrate a specific inhibition of AGEPC-induced hepatic glycogenolysis and vasoconstriction by beta-adrenergic stimulation of the perfused liver. This inhibition appears to be mediated by interaction of isoproterenol with nonparenchymal cells within the liver. These findings are consistent with the concept that AGEPC stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis by an indirect mechanism involving hepatic vasoconstriction.", 
    "12": "The effects of medroxalol, a new beta-blocking drug, were simultaneously studied on the brachial artery, the arterioles and the veins of the forearm in 15 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension after administration of a single oral dose of 200 mg, by means of pulsed Doppler velocimetry of the brachial artery and strain gauge mercury-in silastic plethysmography of the forearm. In addition the systolic time intervals including preejection period (PEP) and left ventricular time (LVET) were also measured after drug administration. Acute oral medroxalol produced a rapid and significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in heart rate. Concomitantly a significant increase was observed in brachial artery diameter (p less than 0.05), blood velocity and flow (p less than 0.01); forearm vascular resistance decreased (p less than 0.001) but forearm venous tone was unchanged. Lastly medroxalol prolonged PEP but shortened LVET corrected for heart rate. These results demonstrate a rapid antihypertensive action of a single dose of medroxalol with a dilation of the arteries but not of the veins of the forearm and a discrepant effect on the systolic time intervals.", 
    "13": "Heart rate (HR) slowing action and the possible negative inotropic effect of pindolol (P) (daily dose +/- standard error of the means (SEM): 14.7 +/- 1.6 mg) were studied in 12 patients with heart failure and with rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) resistant to effective beta-methyl dioxin (BMD) doses (mean plasma digoxin concentration +/- SEM: 2.05 +/- 0.17 ng/ml). Mild bicycle ergometer exercise test with the same work load was performed under both BMD and combined BMD--P therapy. Rest exercise and 5 minute recovery HR were significantly lower under combined BMD--P therapy than under BMD alone (80.8 +/- 3 vs. 101 +/- 4.5 beats/min, 123.8 +/- 3.9 vs. 155.8 +/- 7.6 beats/min and 84.9 +/- 2.6 vs. 105.1 +/- 4.5 beats min respectively, p less than 0.001, paired t test). Differences in cardiac volume were not significant (1.131 +/- 76 vs. 1.116 +/- 92 ml). Although all patients were clinically improved under combined BMD--P therapy the 13 to 14% increase in cardiac volume noted in 3 cases could be related to some negative inotropic effect of P. It is concluded that in patients with heart failure and with rapid AF resistant to digitalis, the association of P to digitalis is effective in rest- and mild-exercise HR control without a clinically expressed negative inotropic effect.", 
    "14": "Myocardial bridges may exert an ischemic effect on the myocardium and often warrant therapy including surgical correction in selected cases. Decrease in systolic compression after the administration of propranolol has not been reported. We report a patient who demonstrated angiographic systolic compression of the coronary artery with subsequent improvement on treatment with propranolol. The reduction in severity of systolic compression caused by propranolol may be due to the negative inotropic effect and perhaps from an increase in coronary artery vascular tone secondary to a beta-blocker with unopposed alpha effect. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in patients with myocardial bridging and the use of intravenous propranolol at the time of coronary angiography may have practical implications in selecting drug therapy for patients with symptomatic myocardial bridging.", 
    "15": "Cumene and n-propanol, model substances for alcohols and alkylbenzenes, were investigated for sensory irritation in mice. The concentrations within the first 2 min. depressing the respiratory rate by 50% due to the effect in the upper respiratory tract were 2,058 p.p.m. and 22,080 p.p.m., respectively. Activation of the sensory irritant receptor followed the dynamics of reversible bimolecular reactions. The extrapolated maximum response and the apparent dissociation constant were 114.3% and 2,723 p.p.m. for cumene and 68.4% and 8,178 p.p.m. for propanol, respectively. Later on desensitization was observed. The effect was weak for cumene but conspicuous for propanol. For cumene desensitization had the origin in the rise of a threshold. No change in the dissociation constant or the maximum response was found. For propanol a decrease in the maximum response, which may be explained by an allosteric effect, was observed. The pulmonary irritation response was weak for cumene but was for propanol more important than sensory irritation at high concentrations. The following hypotheses are put forward: the effect of pulmonary irritation on the tidal volume is mediated via the stretch receptors while the effect on the respiratory frequency is mediated via the J-receptors.", 
    "16": "30 children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a mean age of 4.9 +/- 4.4 years, 11 infants and 19 children, were followed up for an average of 6.6 +/- 5.6 years. Apart from a systolic murmur in nearly all patients, only a few had symptoms. 7 patients from 5 families had a positive family history. The ECG often showed left ventricular hypertrophy, twice a deep Q wave, and no cases of giant T wave. A subaortic pressure gradient greater than or equal to 40 mm Hg was measured in 6 children, a secondary cardiomyopathy was excluded by biopsy in 8. Associated lesions were coarctation (n = 2) and patent ductus arteriosus (n = 2). 7 children died: 1 infant in congestive heart failure, 3 children suddenly, and 3 postoperatively. The annual mortality rate was 3.5%. Also in childhood, beta-blocker therapy may not prevent sudden cardiac death, nor may operation prevent late complications. In spite of the lack of pressure gradients, the children did not fulfil the criteria of hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy.", 
    "17": "A method has been devised to produce eosinophilia in birds experimentally. Multiple intraperitoneal injections of bovine serum albumin (BSA) produced a greater response than horse serum in young adult fowls, and injections of 2 ml BSA were more effective than injections of 0.2 ml. The highest eosinophilic responses were obtained with injections of BSA together with aluminium hydroxide. Thymectomy had little effect on eosinophil numbers following horse serum injections but irradiation produced a depressed response. Horse serum that had been heated to 56 degrees C for 30 minutes to inactivate complement and to denature proteins, including possible horse IgE, induced an eosinophilic response in 50 per cent of birds compared with only 14 per cent with unheated horse serum. Furthermore, when the former birds were reinjected after a rest period of 13 weeks, the eosinophilic response followed a similar curve as before but a higher proportion of birds responded. Birds aged over two years did not give a good eosinophilic response after horse serum stimulation. There was no consistent correlation between raised IgE levels and eosinophil numbers. Tolerance to horse serum was detected in some birds using a radial immunodiffusion technique. Analyses of blood plasma from birds with eosinophilia showed a significant increase in total amino acids compared with normal birds.", 
    "18": "The involvement of platelet activating factor (PAF) in anaphylaxis was examined by recording the pulmonary responses of anesthetized passively sensitized guinea-pigs to the aerosolization of ovalbumin. Animals were tested with and without BN 52021 (a ginkgolide B, PAF receptor antagonist) pretreatment. Aerosolization of ovalbumin produced a bronchoconstriction (BC) which could be made refractory to additional challenges with the antigen. In animals desensitized to ovalbumin, aerosolization of PAF produced an unattenuated BC. Guinea pigs desensitized by repeated aerosolizations of PAF subsequently showed reduced responses to aerosolized antigen suggesting that PAF may be involved in the BC. Animals pretreated with BN 52021, were protected against the effects of systemically administered PAF and also showed reduced responses to aerosolized antigen. Aerosolization of the leukotriene antagonist, FPL 55712, was ineffective against anaphylactic BC under conditions where catecholamine and histamine release were blocked.", 
    "19": "An experimental model of postoperative ileus was developed in ponies using trauma to, and exposure of, a length of small intestine which gave rise to a reproducible and reversible set of changes in gut activity. This was assessed by recordings of electrical and mechanical activity and by propulsion of spheres from stomach to anus. Activity was depressed, especially in the stomach and colon, and transit was slowed. All drugs given increased electromechanical activity but propranolol was the least effective and did not alter the delayed transit of spheres. Yohimbine was more effective and the addition of bethanechol produced a little extra propulsive action. Metoclopramide had the best effect, virtually returning transit to normal and was the only drug fully restoring coordination of gastric and small intestinal activity which was disrupted by the ileus procedure. Loss of gastroduodenal coordination is probably the central lesion in equine ileus and may be mediated by dopamine.", 
    "20": "Experiments are reviewed in conscious dogs instrumented with ultrasonic crystals for measuring systolic wall thickening and myocardial blood flow (microsphere technique), and studied under a variety of conditions during acute or chronic circumflex coronary stenosis. With acute progressive stenosis, a nearly linear relation was found between normalized subendocardial flow and function. There were no consistent ST segment changes in the body surface electrocardiogram if wall thickening was less than 25%, although changes occurred in the subendocardial electrogram. The regional flow-function relation was then examined during exercise with various degrees of coronary stenosis; the mean flow-function relation was shifted to the right of the resting relation, but when subendocardial flow was expressed per beat and function normalized as a fraction of that in normal wall the relationship was superimposable upon the resting relation, suggesting that ischemia is absolute (not relative) in the subendocardium during steady state conditions. When the normal increase of wall thickening during exercise was prevented by mild coronary stenosis ischemia could not be clearly detected, but when function during exercise averaged 20% below the resting value, subendocardial blood flow changes and other evidence of ischemia were readily apparent, indicating the sensitivity of wall motion for detecting subcritical coronary stenosis. The regional flow-function relation was also studied in chronic single vessel coronary artery stenosis (ameroid constrictor), in which function was normal at rest (collateral development) but exercise produced large decreases in both regional flow and function. At matched levels of treadmill exercise, a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) together with beta blockade (atenolol) produced an additive effect that was greater than with either drug alone, with substantial increases in both subendocardial flow and regional function. Finally, studies showing reversible post-reperfusion dysfunction after 15 minutes or two hours of coronary occlusion are reviewed. Partial ischemia for 5-hours, followed by reperfusion also produced regional dysfunction which persisted for at least 3 days but reverted to normal by one week, with little or no histologic damage of the free wall. These studies on regional flow and function during ischemia may carry implications for a number of important clinical phenomena.", 
    "21": "Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reliably induced hypophagia in non-deprived rats and in rats tested following a period of food-deprivation, regardless of the presence or absence of water during testing. The hyperdipsic effect of 5-HT, however, was sensitive to changes in the length of food-deprivation, suggesting a possible interaction between 5-HT hyperdipsia and prandial drinking. Both 5-HT hypophagia and hyperdipsia were attenuated by methysergide pretreatment, thus confirming the involvement of peripheral post-synaptic 5-HT receptors in both effects. Pretreatment with propranolol blocked 5-HT hyperdipsia, but did not alter 5-HT hypophagia, thus suggesting that 5-HT hypophagia and hyperdipsia are mediated by different mechanisms at some point subsequent to the stimulation of peripheral 5-HT receptors. These results are consistent with other evidence that 5-HT hyperdipsia is mediated by stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system. It is tentatively suggested that 5-HT hypophagia could result from 5-HT-induced inhibition of cephalic phase insulin secretion.", 
    "22": "Fifteen patients (age: 57.6 +/- 14 years) showing dual A-V nodal pathways pattern during basal electrophysiological testing were studied following pharmacological autonomic blockade (iv propranolol 0.2 mg/Kg and iv atropine 0.04 mg/Kg). After induction of the autonomic blockade, the dual A-V nodal pathways pattern was not present in four patients due to disappearance of the slow pathway; the pattern remained in 11 (73%). The longest A2-H2 interval, the effective and functional refractory periods of the fast pathway did not change significantly following autonomic blockade. Even the electrophysiological measures of the slow pathway, in the 11 patients in whom they were comparable, did not change significantly after autonomic blockade. These data suggest that: the dual A-V nodal pathways pattern is mainly related to the intrinsic structure of the A-V node; the autonomic nervous system only affects in a variable way the refractoriness and the conduction velocity in the two pathways.", 
    "23": "Endurance training helps muscle tissue oxidize lipids and therefore helps conserve glycogen. It was thought interesting to find out if, in addition to this preferential use of fatty acids by muscle tissue, there is an increase in the capacity of adipose tissue to mobilize lipids. So the response to epinephrine of collagenase-isolated fat cells obtained after biopsies of fat performed in the periumbilical region of 10 trained marathon runners (T) and 10 sedentary subjects (S), all males, was studied in vitro. Glycerol release, chosen as adipocyte lipolysis indicator, was measured by bioluminescence. Lipolysis was studied with increased epinephrine concentration. This caused a significant increase in lipolysis only in the T subjects. The dose-response curves were significantly different for T and S subjects at 10(-6) M and above (P less than 0.05). To determine the modification mechanisms observed, lipolysis with isoproterenol and epinephrine plus propranolol were studied. Isoproterenol significantly increased lipolysis in both groups. The dose-response curves were significantly different at 10(-7) M (P less than 0.01) and above. In both groups, epinephrine plus propranolol significantly decreased lipolysis without distinction between T and S. It is concluded that in male subjects endurance training increases the sensitivity of subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue to the lipolytic action of epinephrine; this effect seems to be related to an increased response of the beta-adrenergic pathways.", 
    "24": "The effects of purgatives on the antidotal efficacy of oral activated charcoal were studied in seven volunteer subjects. The volunteer subjects were given 1000 mg of aspirin, 100 mg of atenolol and 50 mg of phenylpropanolamine with 100 ml of water on an empty stomach and were assigned randomly to the following treatment groups: after 5 min 150 ml of water, after 5 min 25 g of charcoal, after 5 min charcoal orally with 20 mg of metoclopramide rectally, followed by 10 mg of bisacodyl rectally 3 h afterwards, after 5 min charcoal with 250 ml of magnesium citrate USP and after 60 min charcoal with metoclopramide followed by bisacodyl 3 h thereafter. The plasma concentrations (0-24 h) and the cumulative urinary excretion (0-72 h) of salicylates, atenolol and phenylpropanolamine were measured. Both magnesium citrate and metoclopramide combined with bisacodyl hastened the gastrointestinal transit but magnesium citrate was more effective. Charcoal alone reduced the absorption of aspirin and phenylpropanolamine by about 50% and that of atenolol by about 95%. The purgatives did not modify significantly the efficacy of charcoal. When the antidotal treatment was delayed by 60 min its efficacy was reduced to some extent, possibly depending on the pharmaceutical formulation of the test drugs. The present results do not support the routine use of purgatives in combination with activated charcoal. In some instances, however, their use may promote the evacuation of, for example, depot formulations from the gastrointestinal tract and thus have a beneficial effect together with activated charcoal in reducing absorption.", 
    "25": "The response to mental stress in patients with benign essential tremor is an exaggeration of the resting tremor. We have studied the ability of metoprolol tartrate to attenuate specifically the tremorgenic response to mental stress in five patients with essential tremor who were each studied on four occasions. Treatment regimens consisted of 0-, 25-, 50-, and 75-mg doses of metoprolol tartrate, given twice daily for seven- to ten-day periods. Tremor was measured while patients were resting comfortably and then again following mental stress over eight-hour study periods. During the baseline study period, the investigational mental stress consistently exaggerated tremor in each patient. Metoprolol treatment reduced both the resting tremor and tremor following mental activity, but the drug-induced change in the response to mental stress was more pronounced than the drug-induced reduction in resting tremor. The ability of metoprolol to blunt the response to mental stress was associated with serum concentrations of the drug. The time courses of metoprolol serum concentrations were similar to the time course of metoprolol's ability to blunt the response to mental stress. Metoprolol possesses the ability to blunt the tremorgenic response to mental stress in patients with essential tremor, but the duration of this effect lasts less than seven hours after administration of a dose.", 
    "26": "Hypertension after brain injury requires comprehensive evaluation and management. Focal brain injury to centers of blood pressure regulation, high levels of circulating catecholamines from generalized trauma or intracranial lesions, increased intracranial pressure, pheochromocytomas unmasked after trauma, and occult spinal cord injury with hyperreflexia represent possible causes of hypertension after brain injury. This case of a brain-injured patient who had episodes of hypertension and diaphoresis with catecholamine elevations in plasma and urine, and evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, demonstrates the importance of a thorough neuroendocrine evaluation in brain-injured patients with hypertension. When high levels of catecholamines are found, without further evidence of a pheochromocytoma, treatment with a beta blocker is appropriate.", 
    "27": "We quantified ventricular suction flow, volume, and pressure under hydrostatically zero source pressure for filling. A large-bore electromagnetic flow probe was placed in the valve-free mitral annulus of the dog heart that had been excised and was cross circulated with the left atrium widely opened. With the heart immersed in a blood pool, ventricular suction flow and transmural pressure were measured. After a rapid ejection flow [peak: 110 +/- 47 (SD) ml . s-1 . 100 g left ventricle-1] during systole, a slow suction flow (peak: 26 +/- 20 ml . s-1 . 100 g-1) occurred during diastole despite the zero source pressure for filling. Peak transmural pressure during ejection was 6 +/- 3 mmHg, and peak negative transmural pressure during suction was 2 +/- 1 mmHg. Suction volume, which was equal to ejection volume in steady state, was 8 +/- 3 ml/100 g left ventricle. Increases in paced heart rate markedly decreased suction volume by curtailing diastolic filling time. Epinephrine, propranolol, calcium, and verapamil variably changed suction volume, and these effects were primarily accounted for by the accompanied heart rate changes.", 
    "28": "The secretomotor action of choline on salivary secretion has been studied in the isolated perfused mandibular gland of the rat. Choline made up in substituted Ringer solutions (Na concentrations of 40, 70, or 100 mM) was an effective secretomotor agonist in the concentration range of 1-100 mM and evoked secretory responses comparable with those of acetylcholine (0.05-1.0 microM) administered at similar Na concentrations. Continuous infusion of choline, in contrast to acetylcholine, did not lead to a fall off in the secretory response (desensitization or tachyphylaxis) until the choline concentration used exceeded approximately 80 mM. The secretomotor action of choline (46 mM) was blocked completely and reversibly by atropine (5 microM) but not by propranolol (2.5 microM) and phentolamine (2.5 microM) administered together. When acetylcholine (1.0 or 0.05 microM) was infused on a background of choline stimulation, a small additional secretory response was elicited whenever the choline stimulus was submaximal, and, regardless of the choline concentration employed, addition of acetylcholine always induced tachyphylaxis. The results suggest that choline and acetylcholine act on the same population of muscarinic receptors, but it is unclear why choline does not evoke tachyphylaxis. The response to choline allows us to exclude a number of the possible causes of tachyphylaxis that have previously been considered, so that an excessive buildup of cytosolic free Ca now remains as the most likely cause of the phenomenon.", 
    "29": "The intervillous blood flow and other maternal hemodynamic parameters were assessed in 40 mothers with pregnancy-induced hypertension in late pregnancy before and after hypotensive treatment. Furosemide caused a significant decrease in the intervillous blood flow, whereas the effects of dihydralazine and metoprolol were both negative and positive, that is, more individual and diverse. These changes in the intervillous blood flow did not have any correlation with the changes in other maternal hemodynamic parameters. The importance of placental hemodynamic studies in the evaluation of hypotensive drugs is stressed.", 
    "30": "The blood pressure response to the administration of epinephrine-containing local anesthetics was studied prospectively in ten patients taking propranolol and in ten control patients. While no significant alteration in blood pressure was documented for the patients taking propranolol, the blood pressures of the control group tended to decrease following injection of anesthetic. The variation in blood pressure response between the two groups was statistically significant and represents a mild manifestation of the blockade of beta-2 receptors of the vascular beds from the propranolol. The uncommon occurrence of a malignant hypertensive response from a propranolol-epinephrine reaction is probably a dose-related, somewhat idiosyncratic sensitivity of the peripheral vasculature to the alpha pressor effect of epinephrine unmasked by the blockade of beta receptors. The risk of this catastrophic event must be weighed against the risk of precipitating a myocardial ischemic event from too rapid an alteration in propranolol dosage. Malignant hypertension is probably uncommon in patients receiving low doses of epinephrine during most dermatologic procedures.", 
    "31": "Pharmacological agents that might influence the poststimulus rebound contractile response (PSRR) through an action on the intrinsic inhibitory innervation of the circular muscle coat were studied in the large intestine of the piebald mouse model for Hirschsprung's disease. Tetrodotoxin (0.3-3 microM) suppressed, in a dose-dependent manner, the amplitude, duration, and area under the contractile traces of the PSRR and increased the latency for the response in ganglionated segments of the large intestine of piebald and normal mice. Sensitivity to tetrodotoxin was greater in the megacolon of piebald mice than in the colon of normal mice. Norepinephrine (6-360 microM) suppressed all parameters of the PSRR in ganglionated regions of the large intestine of abnormal mice. Sensitivity to norepinephrine was greater in the megacolon than in the colon of normal mice. Norepinephrine abolished spontaneous contractile behavior in ganglionated regions of the large intestine of normal and diseased mice and in the aganglionic segment of the piebald mice. Suppression of the PSRR by phentolamine and propranolol were interpreted as nonspecific local anesthetic effects. Atropine (20-200 microM) increased the area under the contractile traces in the midcolon of the intestine of both normal and piebald mice and had no effects on the terminal segment of the large intestine of normal mice. Spontaneous contractile activity and baseline tension were increased by atropine (350 microM) in all preparations. The nicotinic agonist, DMPP (3-157 microM), suppressed the PSRR in the ganglionated regions of the bowel from both normal and abnormal mice. DMPP relaxed resting tension in ganglionated regions, but did not affect the aganglionic terminal segment of the piebald mouse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The influence of concomitant food intake on the bioavailability and presystemic primary conjugation of propranolol (80 mg) was studied in 11 healthy women. Food increased the maximum serum concentration and serum AUC of propranolol (P less than 0.05) and reduced those of conjugated propranolol (P less than 0.05). The mean AUC ratio of conjugated/unchanged propranolol was 13:1 in the fasting state but only about 6:1 in the nonfasting state (P less than 0.001). The time to maximum serum concentration and the t1/2 were not affected by food. There was no influence of food on any kinetic parameter of propranolol or conjugated propranolol when a slow-release formulation was used. We conclude that concomitant food intake can evoke a short-lasting, delivery rate-dependent inhibition of the presystemic primary conjugation of propranolol. This is one, but not the sole, mechanism by which food can enhance propranolol bioavailability.", 
    "33": "Normal subjects given propranolol increased their plasma t1/2 for infused isoproterenol from 2.68 to 6.25 minutes. Propranolol increased plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels only slightly. Propranolol increased the t1/2 of isoproterenol but not that of NE in men with autonomic nervous system degeneration. This suggests that propranolol acts on nonneuronal uptake-2 processes, rather than on uptake-1 mechanisms. alpha-Blockers slow uptake-1 and beta-blockers slow uptake-2 processes. When 27 subjects exercised, those who attained the highest plasma levels of the alpha- and beta-receptor agonist NE also had the briefest apparent t1/2 for NE. Adrenergic receptor blocking drugs slow catecholamine clearance. NE may stimulate its own clearance.", 
    "34": "Daily afternoon injections of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, for 8 weeks inhibited the number of vacuoles and concretions formed in the gerbil pineal gland. The data suggest that sympathetic input to the pineal gland is necessary for the formation of pineal concretions.", 
    "35": "We have examined if the age-related susceptibility of DBA/2J mice to audiogenic seizures is the result of an abnormality in the number or sensitivity of brain adrenoceptors. The binding of alpha 1-, alpha 2-, and beta-adrenoceptor ligands to membranes prepared from whole brain or regions of brain of DBA/2J mice was measured at various ages, corresponding to the periods before, during, and after the maximal sensitivity to audiogenic seizures. For comparison, we have studied concurrently age-matched C57 Bl/6 mice, a strain resistant to audiogenic seizures at all ages. There was no difference in the binding of alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptor ligands to whole brain membranes between the two strains of mice at any age. The maximal number of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites was lower in whole brains of DBA/2J mice than of C57 Bl/6 mice at all ages studied except 13-15 days of age. The differences were small (maximally 17%) but were statistically significant at 21-23 days of age, the time of maximal sensitivity of DBA/2J mice to audiogenic seizures. No difference between the two strains was found in the number or affinity of alpha 1- or alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding sites at any age in any of the brain regions studied. The age-related susceptibility of DBA/2J mice to audiogenic seizures is not the result of an abnormality in number or sensitivity of alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptor binding sites, but a reduced number of alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites may be involved.", 
    "36": "Isolated segments of epicardial coronary artery with and without severe atherosclerotic lesions excised from human hearts 3 to 5 hours after sudden coronary death demonstrated spontaneous contractile activity that was dependent on the external calcium level and was inhibited by calcium antagonists and activation of beta-adrenoceptors (isoproterenol and high concentrations of norepinephrine). Isoproterenol, with a median effective dose (ED50) of 6.3 X 10(-7) M, relaxed coronary segments that had been precontracted with 30 mM potassium. Stimulation of the alpha-adrenoceptors activated spontaneous contractions and increased tension. Norepinephrine ED50 (in the presence of 10(-6) M propranolol) was 2.3 X 10(-7) M, and tension at a maximal concentration of 10(-4) M was 385.4 +/- 51.4 mg. The ED50 for acetylcholine and histamine, the potent activators of coronary segment tone and phasic contractility, was 3.98 X 10(-7) and 8.9 X 10(-7) M, respectively; the maximal increase in tension was 1,079.5 +/- 175 (at 10(-4) M) and 1,131.3 +/- 302 mg (at 10(-5) M), respectively. Acetylcholine and histamine increased whereas high concentrations of norepinephrine failed to inhibit rhythmic activity and tension of coronary artery segments with severe atherosclerotic lesions. Membrane electrogenic mechanisms and ways of activating the contractile elements of human coronary artery smooth muscle are discussed.", 
    "37": "The relation between plasma norepinephrine levels and the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing was prospectively evaluated in 17 patients. Ten patients had reproducible ventricular tachycardia exclusively during exercise or recovery, or both; 7 patients had ventricular tachycardia only during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. The two groups did not differ in age, exercise duration, left ventricular ejection fraction at rest, heart rate throughout the exercise protocol, rest QTc interval, change in QTc interval during exercise, the presence of coronary artery disease or exercise-related myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, there was no difference between groups in plasma norepinephrine levels at rest, peak exercise or in the recovery period. Myocardial ischemia was detectable by thallium perfusion scan in only 2 of the 10 patients with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia. The 10 patients with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia underwent repeat exercise testing immediately after maximal intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Although they had no change in exercise duration, ventricular tachycardia did not occur in 9 of these 10 patients. Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly decreased compared with levels before beta-adrenergic blockade (p less than 0.0002). Thus, plasma norepinephrine levels do not distinguish patients with reproducible exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia from otherwise comparable patients. Propranolol is highly effective in abolishing this arrhythmia and this effect is associated with decreased norepinephrine levels.", 
    "38": "The electrophysiologic determinants of conversion and the prevention of atrial flutter are poorly defined. This issue was therefore investigated by evaluating the effects of the new class III antiarrhythmic drug d-sotalol and the class I antiarrhythmic drugs quinidine and lidocaine. Atrial flutter was reproducibly induced in the open-chest anesthetized dog with intercaval crush and rapid atrial pacing. In this preparation, intravenous d-sotalol restored sinus rhythm in 14 of 15 (93%) dogs, whereas quinidine converted nine of 15 (60%) and lidocaine two of 10 (20%). d-Sotalol prevented reinduction in eight (53%), whereas quinidine was effective in four (27%) and lidocaine in none (0%). In the atria, d-sotalol induced significant increases in effective refractory period (+32%; p less than .01), functional refractory period (+30%; p less than .01), conduction time at an atrial paced cycle length of 150 msec (+9%; p less than .05), and atrial flutter cycle length (+8%; p less than .01). Quinidine increased effective refractory period (+40%; p less than .01), functional refractory period (+27%; p less than .01), conduction time at sinus cycle length (+13%; p less than .01), conduction time at an atrial paced cycle length of 150 msec (+18%; p less than .01), and atrial flutter cycle length (+31%; p less than .01). Lidocaine decreased functional refractory period (-6%; p less than .05) while lengthening the atrial flutter cycle length (+13%; p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

With the increased use of advanced technology in routine obstetric practice, fetal tachycardias are being diagnosed with greater frequency. Recently, administration of antiarrhythmic medications to the mother has been successful in slowing the fetal heart rate and preventing or reversing potentially lethal complications in the fetus. The medications that have been used to treat fetal tachycardia and their potential effects on the mother are discussed. A case study and nursing protocol are presented.", 
    "40": "This study investigated whether the specific alpha-antagonist, prazosin, stimulated basal plasma renin levels and heart rate. Furthermore the beta-adrenergic nervous system was also investigated to ascertain whether it was involved in this effect. Prazosin (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) to conscious normotensive rats, either alone or in combination with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, DL-propranolol (1 or 3 mg/kg). Rats bore chronically implanted dorsal aorta cannula for measurement of blood pressure and heart rate and blood sampling for renin determinations. Acute administration of prazosin (1 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a fall in mean arterial pressure accompanied by renin release and tachycardia. A tenfold lower dose of prazosin did not alter blood pressure or heart rate but did stimulate renin release. Acute administration of DL-propranolol, (1 or 3 mg/kg, s.c.) produced falls in blood pressure and heart rate but did not affect plasma renin level. Combinations of prazosin with propranolol gave falls in blood pressure similar to those predicted on the basis of a simple addition of the effects of the two drugs given separately. Prazosin-induced tachycardia and renin release were attenuated by propranolol. It appears that prazosin produces renin release and tachycardia via stimulation of the beta-adrenergic adrenoceptor.", 
    "41": "Electrical stimulation of the nerve bundles around the hepatic artery and the portal vein activates both the sympathetic and parasympathetic liver nerves; the sympathetic effects clearly predominate. Parasympathetic effects were therefore studied in the rat liver perfused in situ by perivascular nerve stimulation in the presence of both an alpha- and a beta-blocker. In the presence of the alpha-blocker phentolamine and the beta-blocker propranolol all sympathetic nerve effects were prevented; the remaining parasympathetic stimulation had no influence on the basal glucose and lactate metabolism nor on the hemodynamics. Insulin alone, with both alpha- and beta-blockade, provoked a small, parasympathetic nerve stimulation in the presence of insulin a more pronounced enhancement of glucose utilization. In the presence of an alpha- and beta-blocker perivascular nerve stimulation antagonized the glucagon stimulated glucose release, but did not affect lactate exchange. The nerve effect was abolished by the parasympathetic antagonist atropine. Acetylcholine or insulin, with both an alpha- and beta-blocker present, mimicked the effects of nerve stimulation antagonizing the glucagon-stimulated glucose release. Nerve stimulation in the presence of insulin was more effective than either stimulus alone. The present results show that in rat liver stimulation of the parasympathetic hepatic nerves has direct effects on glucose metabolism synergistic with insulin and antagonistic to glucagon.", 
    "42": "In a prospective, randomized controlled trial, 53 patients with variceal hemorrhage from portal hypertension, including 44 with cirrhosis, were allocated, after initial control of the bleeding, to treatment by sclerotherapy alone, or by this together with oral propranolol in a dose sufficient to reduce resting pulse rate by 25% during the period up to the time when varices were obliterated. Eight of the 27 patients undergoing sclerotherapy alone rebled during this period as compared to 7 of the 26 patients in the additional propranolol group (p greater than 0.80), two patients from each group dying from uncontrollable variceal hemorrhage. Propranolol precipitated encephalopathy in one patient and complicated resuscitation following bleeding in a second, and as there was no evidence in this study that use of the drug reduced the frequency or severity of the variceal bleeding, its administration cannot be recommended during the period prior to obliteration of varices by sclerotherapy.", 
    "43": "Long-term timolol treatment after acute myocardial infarction is associated with a significant reduction in mortality and nonfatal reinfarction. To evaluate whether the reduction in mortality and morbidity is exclusively or partly dependent on a reduction in heart rate (HR), cardiac events in the Norwegian Timolol Multicenter Study were analyzed according to resting HR at baseline and at 1 month of follow-up Resting HR at baseline was a significant predictor of total death and all events (total death plus nonfatal reinfarction) both in placebo- and in timolol-treated patients. In the placebo group the median resting HR was unchanged from baseline to 1 month control (72 beats/min), but was reduced from 72 beats/min to 56 beats/min in the timolol group. Resting HR during follow-up remained a significant predictor of total death. Further, mortality at a given HR during treatment was not markedly different whether the HR was spontaneous or caused by timolol. Timolol treatment was related to a significant reduction in mortality, and this study suggests that the major effect of timolol treatment on mortality after acute myocardial infarction may be attributed to the reduction in HR. Timolol treatment was also associated with an overall reduction in nonfatal reinfarction. However, nonfatal reinfarction was inversely related to resting HR during follow-up, indicating that although coronary artery occlusion in low-risk patients may cause nonfatal reinfarction, the outcome in high-risk patients is more likely to be death. When analyzing mortality and nonfatal reinfarction combined, timolol treatment was related to a reduction in cardiac events at any given HR, suggesting that factors in addition to HR reduction are important in the protective effects of timolol.", 
    "44": "The effect of combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade, and the effect of epinephrine infusion, on the rate of glucose oxidation has been tested in conscious dogs. The dogs were prepared seven to ten days before the experiment with chronic catheters and tracheostomy. Glucose oxidation was measured by means of the primed-constant infusion of U-14C-glucose and indirect calorimetry. Six experimental groups were tested. In all groups, insulin and glucagon concentrations were held constant throughout by the inhibition of their secretion with somatostatin and intraportal replacement at basal rates. All experiments consisted of two two-hour periods. In half of the experiments, combined alpha- and beta-adrenergic blockade was administered in the second period, and in the other experiments, epinephrine was infused in the second period. The adrenergic blockade or epinephrine infusion (E) was performed in three different groups. In one, free fatty acid (FFA) levels were allowed to change spontaneously in response to blockade or E; in a second group, liposyn and heparin were infused throughout periods 1 and 2 in order to maintain FFA levels at high, constant levels; and in a third group, FFA levels were maintained at a constant low level in periods 1 and 2 by means of an infusion of nicotinic acid. In all cases tested, epinephrine infusion caused an increase in the rate of glucose oxidation. Adrenergic blockade also caused an increase in glucose oxidation when FFA levels were allowed to spontaneously fall; but when FFA levels were held constant (either high or low), there was no effect on glucose oxidation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "In helical strips of proximal and distal coronary arteries from beagles of different ages (30 days, 3 months and 1 and 3 years old) precontracted partially with prostaglandin F2 alpha, responses to catecholamines, transmural electrical stimulation, tyramine and acetylcholine were compared. Proximal coronary arteries from infant beagles responded to norepinephrine and epinephrine with contractions, whereas those from adult (1 and 3 years old) beagles responded with dose-related relaxations. Isoproterenol-induced relaxations were in the order of infant less than young less than adult beagle arteries. Norepinephrine produced contractions in the proximal arteries from infant beagles but relaxations in the distal arteries. Relaxations induced by norepinephrine and isoproterenol were in the order of small greater than medium greater than large-size arteries from adult beagles. Transmural stimulation and tyramine produced contractions in the infant and young beagle arteries of proximal portion but only relaxations in the adult beagle arteries. The contractions induced by transmural stimulation and norepinephrine were suppressed by prazosin but not by yohimbine. Acetylcholine produced similar magnitude of relaxations in the arteries from beagles of different ages. It may be concluded that contractions of coronary arteries mediated by alpha-1 adrenoceptors decrease with age, whereas beta receptor-mediated relaxations increase with age. Alpha-1 adrenoceptor functions appear to be in the order of large greater than medium greater than small-size coronary arteries from beagles of different ages, and beta receptor functions to be in the reverse order.", 
    "46": "To study peripheral mechanisms underlying cardiovascular responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) we recorded the effects of i.c.v. infusions of TRH in urethane-anesthetized rats after various drug pretreatments, nephrectomy or renal denervation. TRH invariably increased blood pressure, heart rate and sympathetic nerve activity. After alpha-1 adrenergic blockade with prazosin, pressor responses to TRH were delayed in onset and reduced in magnitude. After renal denervation or pretreatment with propranolol for beta adrenergic blockade, captopril for converting enzyme inhibition or Sar1Ile8 angiotensin II for angiotensin II blockade, pressor responses to TRH were unaltered during the first few minutes but became significantly reduced thereafter. Bilateral nephrectomy inhibited markedly the whole pressor response including its onset and subsequent elevation. Consequently, initial inhibition by prazosin was considered due to removal of alpha-1 adrenergic vasoconstriction whereas the later attenuation was attributed to antagonism of the renin-angiotensin system. None of the procedures tested affected the attendant sympathetic hyperactivity, but the tachycardia was prevented by beta adrenergic blockade. These results are compatible with the interpretation that, by acting centrally, TRH stimulates sympathetic hyperactivity which then elevates blood pressure by increasing not only sympathetic vasomotor tone but also renal renin secretion.", 
    "47": "The antihypertensive effect of transdermal nitroglycerin was tested in 11 men with hypertension (mean age 60 years) whose diastolic blood pressure exceeded 90 mm Hg while receiving a diuretic and a beta-adrenergic blocker. In a double-blind, randomized crossover trial the subjects received weekly increments of placebo or nitroglycerin (5, 10, 20, and 30 cm2) for 4 weeks each. The final dose of nitroglycerin was 22.5 cm2 (mean). During week 4 of nitroglycerin dosing, sitting and standing systolic blood pressures were reduced (P less than 0.05). Diastolic blood pressures and heart rates did not change during the study. In the five subjects with systolic hypertension (greater than or equal to 150 mm Hg), the mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 24 mm Hg (P less than 0.01). Further studies are needed to determine if transdermal nitroglycerin has a role in the treatment of systolic hypertension.", 
    "48": "Enprostil, an orally active prostaglandin E2 analog, is undergoing clinical trials in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Because results of animal studies suggested that prostaglandins might affect both hepatic drug metabolizing ability and hepatic blood flow, the effects of enprostil on drug elimination were studied and compared with those of the standard antiulcer drug cimetidine in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of nine normal subjects. Cimetidine reduced the oral clearance of propranolol by 50%, consistent with the inhibition of drug metabolism reported in previous studies. On the other hand, enprostil had no effect on propranolol elimination. Neither drug altered liver blood flow as assessed either by the clearance of indocyanine green or by the technique of dual route of administration of propranolol. Thus in contrast to cimetidine, enprostil had no effect on hepatic drug metabolism.", 
    "49": "We evaluated the ability of Doppler echocardiography to assess left ventricular performance in six open-chest dogs studied under various conditions. Intravenous infusions of nitroglycerin were used to vary preload, atrial pacing was used to control heart rate, and changes in inotropic state were induced by two different doses of dobutamine (5 and 10 micrograms/kg/min iv) and by administration of propranolol (1 mg/kg iv). Left ventricular anterior wall myocardial segment length was used as an index of preload. Maximum aortic blood flow, peak acceleration of aortic blood flow, and dP/dt were measured with an electromagnetic flow probe around the ascending aorta and a high-fidelity pressure transducer in the left ventricle. A continuous-wave Doppler transducer applied to the aortic arch was used to measure peak aortic blood velocity, mean acceleration, time to peak velocity, and the systolic velocity integral. The differences between mean values obtained under different inotropic conditions were significant at the p less than .01 level for peak velocity and at the p less than .05 level for mean acceleration. Within a given animal, Doppler measurements of peak velocity correlated very closely with maximum aortic flow (r = .96), maximum acceleration of aortic flow (r = .95), and with maximum dP/dt (r = .92). Mean acceleration measured by Doppler echocardiography also correlated very closely with conventional indexes, but was subject to greater interobserver variability. Doppler measurements of time to peak and the systolic velocity integral correlated less well with conventional hemodynamic indexes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A rise in plasma ACTH and beta-EP after metyrapone occurred in all investigated subjects. The rate of increase varied greatly from one individual to the other, but no significant differences between the mean values of plasma ACTH and beta-EP in different groups of headache patients and volunteers were observed. Three months of nadolol therapy in migraine patients caused a significant increase in plasma ACTH and decrease in beta-EP concentrations. Findings support the view that migraine patients do not have a primary dysfunction of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as demonstrated by methods currently in use.", 
    "51": "The reflex tachycardia to arterial vasodilation was analysed in anaesthetized and ventilated Long Evans rats. Nicardipine was given by slow intravenous injection. The decrease in blood pressure was accompanied by a sympathetically mediated reflex tachycardia. The slope of the mean blood pressure-pulse period relationship was considered as an index of baroreflex sensitivity. Two injections of nicardipine were given during a single experiment. For studying the suprapontine control of the baroreflex arc, rats were subjected to transient (10 min) bilateral hemispheric ischaemia. These rats exhibited a blood pressure drop following recirculation and baroreflex sensitivity was impaired. Pretreatment with alpha-methyldopa, guanfacine and enalapril lowered mean blood pressure to a similar extent. In those rats pretreated with alpha-methyldopa and guanfacine transient hemispheric ischaemia did not alter baroreflex sensitivity while enalapril pretreated rats exhibited an impaired baroreflex. The protective effect of alpha-methyldopa and guanfacine against the cardiovascular consequence of hemispheric ischaemia may depend on reduced monoamine turnover resulting from central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "52": "By the use of an earlier characterised cDNA clone, CIN-1, corresponding to a sequence of the mRNA coding for the brown-fat specific \"uncoupling\" protein, thermogenin, the amount of thermogenin mRNA found in the brown adipose tissue of mice was quantitatively investigated under different physiological and pharmacological conditions. It was found that a 4 hr cold stress led to a 7-fold increase in the amount of thermogenin mRNA; injection of norepinephrine had a significant but smaller effect. Most notably, isoprenaline (beta-agonist) and phenylephrine (alpha-agonist) had in themselves no effect, but when injected together were able to increase the mRNA level synergistically. In 4 hr cold-stressed mice, norepinephrine, isoprenaline and cholera toxin could all further potentiate the effect of the cold stress itself on the mRNA level. Insulin and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone both had weak stimulatory effects on the mRNA level. It is concluded that an increase in intracellular cAMP levels is a necessary and perhaps sufficient stimulus for the increase in thermogenin gene expression. However, at least under in vivo conditions, this increase requires stimulation of both alpha- and beta-adrenergic pathways.", 
    "53": "Chronic administration of imipramine with drinking water to Wistar rats for two months did not affect the [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to lymphocytic membranes, though the treatment depressed the radioligand binding to cerebral cortical membranes. The result suggests that the beta-adrenoceptor downregulation caused by the antidepressant in the central nervous system is not reflected in the lymphocytes.", 
    "54": "Intra-amnial administration of isoprenaline (IPRO) to chick embryos induces a number of myocardial lesions. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether similar changes may also be induced after injection of spontaneously oxidized isoprenaline and commercially obtained adrenochrome. Cardiotoxicity of these substances has been demonstrated in adult animals. IPRO, oxidized IPRO, or adrenochrome were administered intra-amnially to 10-day-old chick embryos at doses of 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100.0 mg X kg-1. Parallel experimental groups received propranolol at a dose of 1 mg X kg-1, 15 s before injection of IPRO or oxidized IPRO. The cAMP level in the heart was determined by radioimmunoassay 2 and 30 min after administration of IPRO, oxidized IPRO, or adrenochrome at a single dose of 10.0 mg X kg-1. It has been found that in embryos the effect of IPRO and oxidized IPRO is dose dependent. The rise in mortality and development of cardiomegaly together with increased hydration and disturbances of the development of coronary vascularization were highly significant starting from the dose of 10 mg X kg-1. Furthermore, both drugs significantly increased cAMP levels in the embryonic heart. On the other hand, the administration of adrenochrome was without any effect. The changes induced by IPRO were prevented by the administration of the beta-blocking agent propranolol; the lesions induced by spontaneously oxidized IPRO were, however, prevented only partially.",

Premature and mature newborns show a high variability and a low adaptability of the sympathetic nervous system. In order to investigate whether sympathetic systems are completely developed at birth or underly a postnatal maturation process we have determined plasma levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline as well as the density and affinity of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors on thrombocytes and lymphocytes in pre- and mature newborns and adults. Catecholamines were determined by means of a radioenzymatic method, number and affinity of adrenoceptors by use of the radioactive labelled antagonists 3-H-Yohimbine and 125-I-Cyano-Pindolol. Beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness was assessed by measurement of cyclic AMP in lymphocytes before and after stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors by isoprenaline. A linear relationship occurred between the gestational age and the number of adrenoceptors on lymphocytes, whereas the alpha-adrenoceptors on thrombocytes showed no age dependency. The basal content of cyclic AMP and the accumulation in response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by isoprenaline was significantly lower in newborns than in adults. Since noradrenaline and adrenaline plasma levels were not significantly different in newborns and adults it is assumed that the low density of beta-adrenoceptors in premature and mature newborns is due to a postnatal maturation and not to a \"down regulation\" by circulating catecholamines. Our results suggest that an immaturity of beta-adrenoceptors is involved in the poorly developed adaptive control in newborns.", 
    "56": "Abnormalities of cardiac physiology and anatomy may occur in children with the fetal alcohol syndrome. To understand the basis of these abnormalities, research has been performed which shows that in mice exposed to ethanol from gestation day 8 to birth via a liquid diet regime with pairfed controls there are ultrastructural changes in the cardiac myocytes. To determine if the exposure to ethanol also affects the development of the cardiac noradrenergic system, which in turn could cause developmental abnormalities, beta adrenoreceptor binding was characterized by Scatchard analyses of concentration dependent binding curves in newborn mice exposed to ethanol in utero. Although body and heart weight were lower in newborns from both the pairfed and ethanol groups compared to a normally fed group, no differences in the densities of the beta adrenoceptors or in the Kd values for binding were seen due to the ethanol or the liquid diet regime. Therefore, at least one component of the development of the cardiac sympathetic system was not altered by ethanol exposure or a reduced caloric intake.", 
    "57": "The insulin-antagonistic effect of adrenaline was studied in seven healthy subjects with the euglycaemic clamp technique using two insulin infusion rates (40 and 1200 mU X (m2)-1 min-1). The adrenergic receptor mediating the adrenaline effect was characterized by concomitant infusion of propranolol (beta 1 + beta 2-antagonist) or metoprolol (beta 1-antagonist). Each subject was studied four times (placebo, adrenaline, adrenaline + propranolol, adrenaline + metoprolol). Glucose turnover was measured with D(3-3H)-glucose. Similar plasma insulin levels were reached in all studies with the two insulin infusion rates (mean; placebo 51 +/- 3 and 7421 +/- 337 mU/l respectively). Glucose production was completely inhibited by the low insulin level during placebo infusion. Adrenaline antagonized this effect so that a significant glucose production was seen at the low but not at the high insulin level. Propranolol, but not metoprolol, reversed this insulin-antagonistic effect of adrenaline. Glucose utilization increased from 2.53 +/- 0.17 to 7.28 +/- 0.88 mg X kg-1 X min-1 during placebo when the insulin levels were increased from 4 +/- 0.3 to 51 +/- 3 mU/l. Increasing the insulin levels 150-fold to approximately 7500 mU/l only doubled the glucose utilization (14.68 +/- 1.14 mg X kg-1 X min-1). Adrenaline induced a pronounced inhibition of glucose utilization at both insulin levels (78% and 37% inhibition respectively). Propranolol, but not metoprolol, prevented this effect of adrenaline. Thus, physiological adrenaline levels exert a pronounced insulin-antagonistic effect which is mediated by beta 2-receptor stimulation. The inhibitory effect on glucose uptake is maintained even at high insulin levels when hepatic glucose production is completely abolished.", 
    "58": "The binding of the beta-adrenoceptor radioligand [125I]-iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP) has been studied in pig lung parenchyma and the distribution of binding sites visualised by light microscopic autoradiography. I-CYP binding was saturable (maximum binding capacity Bmax = 51 +/- 3 fmol mg-1 protein), involving sites with high affinity (dissociation constant KD = 73 +/- 10 pM). Specific I-CYP binding was displaceable both by beta-adrenoceptor agonists ((-)-isoprenaline greater than (-)-adrenaline greater than (+/-)-fenoterol greater than (-)-noradrenaline greater than (+)-isoprenaline greater than (+/-)-RO363) and antagonists ((+/-)-propranolol greater than ICI-118551 greater than atenolol), indicating a predominance of beta 2-adrenoceptors. Further analysis showed that displacement data for the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI-118551 were fitted best to a 2 binding site model and that both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors were present in pig lung in the ratio 28:72 respectively. Autoradiographic grains were localized over tissue and were most dense over alveolar walls greater than vascular endothelium greater than vascular smooth muscle greater than bronchial smooth muscle = bronchial epithelium. Atenolol (10(-5) M) caused a 31% reduction in specific grain density over alveolar wall tissue, while a 10 fold lower concentration of ICI-118551 (10(-6) M) caused a 50% decrease. These results are consistent with binding data in pig lung parenchyma demonstrating a mixed population of beta-adrenoceptors with a predominance of the beta 2 subtype. 6 It is possible that the previously described relaxant responses of the pig lung parenchyma strip to beta-agonists, mediated via beta 2-adrenoceptors, resulted from the sum of reactivities in airway and vascular smooth muscle together with relaxation of alveolar interstitial cells.", 
    "59": "Systemic injection of the organometal neurotoxin trimethyltin (TMT) into rats causes impairments in learning and memory. However, there is a discontinuity in dose-response functions, such that the deficit which emerges with a higher, acutely toxic dose, is qualitatively different from the impairment induced after lower doses. To investigate synaptic receptor changes associated with behavioral deficits, neurotransmitter-receptor ligand binding assays were done in forebrain areas of rats given TMT (3.6 or 7.5 mg/kg). Binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand, dihydroalprenolol in frontal cortex and amygdala/pyriform cortex was an inverted U-shaped function of TMT dose, with rats given the median dose exhibiting increased binding. The curvilinear dose-response functions in behavioral and biochemical assays suggest that altered forebrain noradrenergic neurotransmission could play a role in behavioral deficits.", 
    "60": "The hormonal control of Cl transport was examined in rabbit cortical collecting tubules using the lumen-to-bath 36Cl tracer rate coefficient (KCl, nm/s). Tracer movement via Cl-HCO3 exchange was minimized by using HCO3-CO2-free solutions. The electrical driving force was minimized by treating with amiloride. Under these conditions, net Cl transport was zero, yet there was a large KCl that fell 88% on removing bath (trans) Cl. These results are consistent with the mechanism of tracer flux being predominantly Cl self exchange. KCl fell spontaneously with time in vitro; after this decline KCl could be stimulated with 8-bromo-cAMP. cAMP present from the onset of perfusion prevented the time-dependent fall in KCl. When tracer movement was restricted to diffusion by eliminating Cl self exchange (0 Cl bath), cAMP had no effect on KCl. Although both isoproterenol and vasopressin are known to stimulate adenylate cyclase in this epithelium, only isoproterenol mimicked the cAMP effect on KCl. The isoproterenol effect was blocked by either propranolol or prostaglandin E2. Lumen addition of the disulfonic stilbene DIDS had no effect on KCl. Lumen addition of furosemide or trichloromethiazide had minimal or no effect. Taken together, these results indicate that Cl self exchange is regulated by beta-adrenergic agents acting via cAMP. The lack of an effect of vasopressin suggests cellular heterogeneity in this response to cAMP.", 
    "61": "The beta-adrenergic receptor in membranes from cat, rat, and guinea pig hearts appears to undergo spontaneous coupling to the stimulatory nucleotide-regulatory protein, Ns. This was demonstrated by incubating cardiac membranes from acutely reserpinized animals with the alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which is known to \"freeze\" the beta-receptor Ns-complex. The concentration of norepinephrine in these membrane preparations was less than 0.1 nM. Cat heart membranes were preincubated for 10 min at 30 degrees with NEM (10(-7)-10(-3) M) and subsequently incubated with (-)-[125I]iodopindolol (IPIN) (18 min, 30 degrees). NEM caused a concentration-dependent decrease in specific IPIN binding with a maximal reduction of about 20% at 0.1 mM. This decrease occurred even in the absence of MgCl2 (0.5 mM EDTA added as well). A comparable reduction was also observed in myocardial membranes from rat and guinea pig. This fall reflects a decrease in the number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites, as demonstrated by saturation binding experiments with IPIN. The equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand for the remaining receptors was not affected. When increasing concentrations of GTP were included in the preincubation mixture, it resulted in a dose-dependent protection of NEM-induced decrease in IPIN binding. The protection was complete at 0.1 mM GTP. In addition, GTP reversed the NEM effect when added to the incubation mixture 10 min after NEM. The apparent reduction in cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor number by NEM (in the absence of beta-receptor agonist) is compatible with a model in which part of the receptor population is able to undergo spontaneous coupling to Ns.", 
    "62": "In tissues with two classes of binding sites for a drug, it is common to estimate the proportion of each class of binding site by inhibiting the binding of a radioligand with a selective unlabeled ligand. Accurate estimates of the density of each class of binding site, however, will be obtained only if the radioligand is nonselective or used at a concentration that saturates both classes of binding sites. A method of simultaneous regression analysis of multiple inhibition curves, using the program MLAB on the PROPHET system, was used to quantify the selectivity of radioligands for beta-1 or beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The selectivity of [125I]iodopindolol, [125I]iodocyanopindolol, [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and [3H]dihydroalprenolol for beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors was assessed by inhibiting the binding of each radioligand with the beta-1-selective unlabeled ligand ICI 89,406 at increasing concentrations of the radioligand, using membranes prepared from C6 glioma cells, which have both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Scatchard plots for all four radioligands were linear, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.95. [125I]Iodopindolol and [125I]iodocyanopindolol were 3.2- and 2-fold selective, respectively, and [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol and [3H]dihydroalprenolol were 5.8- and 2.3-fold selective, respectively, for beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Values obtained for the densities of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors and the affinities of the receptors for ICI 89,406 were independent of the radioligand used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "The autoregulation of norepinephrine (NE) release mediated by presynaptic alpha and beta adrenoceptors on sympathetic nerve terminals in the heart of pentobarbital-anesthetized dog was studied. NE overflow elicited by left cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation was determined from the coronary sinus blood, by using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Intracoronary infusion of epinephrine (1,3 and 10 micrograms/min) into the left circumflex artery increased basal left ventricular dp/dt maximum (LV dp/dt max) and coronary sinus blood flow. The epinephrine infusion decreased coronary sinus output of NE (NE output) during left cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation. Intracoronary infusion of isoproterenol (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 microgram/min) increased the basal LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow, whereas the stimulation-induced increases in NE output, LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow were not altered by its infusions. Intravenous injection of IPS-339 (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg), a selective beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, diminished the stimulation-induced increases in LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it did not decrease the stimulation-induced increase in NE output. Intracoronary infusion of yohimbine (10, 30 and 100 micrograms/min), a preferentially selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, facilitated the stimulation-induced increases in NE output, LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow. There was no significant difference in the facilitation of the stimulation-induced increases in NE output, LV dp/dt max and coronary sinus blood flow between intracoronary infusion of both isoproterenol (0.1 microgram/min) and yohimbine (100 micrograms/min) and the infusion of yohimbine alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstriction was studied in the in situ, autoperfused pulmonary circulation of the open-chest anesthetized dog utilizing selective alpha adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists. Animals were pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) to eliminate beta adrenoceptor-mediated effects in the pulmonary circulation. Blood was withdrawn from the right femoral artery and transferred, via a peristaltic pump, to the pulmonary arterial branch supplying the left diaphragmatic lobe of the lung. The flow rate of the pump was set so that the perfusion pressure in the lobe was equal to resting diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (10 +/- 1 mm Hg). Under conditions of constant left atrial pressure and pulmonary blood flow, intralobar administration of alpha adrenoceptor agonists elicited increases in perfusion pressure of the lobe, reflecting changes in pulmonary vascular resistance. Intralobar administration of the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine and the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist B-HT 933 elicited dose-dependent increases in lobar perfusion pressure, as did the nonselective alpha adrenoceptor agonist norepinephrine. Prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited pulmonary vasopressor responses to methoxamine and norepinephrine without altering significantly the response to B-HT 933. Rauwolscine (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, inhibited the response to B-HT 933 and norepinephrine with little effect on methoxamine. Intralobar administration of tyramine to evoke the release of endogenous norepinephrine resulted in dose-dependent increases in lobar perfusion pressure. The response to tyramine was inhibited selectively by prazosin with little effect of rauwolscine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "A model of the components of autonomic control of heart rate was developed and used for the evaluation of quantitative contribution of sympathetic and vagal tone to cardiac function. In conscious rabbits, sequential inhibition of muscarinic and beta receptors was produced and the relative contributions of vagal and sympathetic tone were characterized. Based on the model, the magnitude of presynaptic interaction between the vagal and sympathetic nerve endings was evaluated. From data in the literature, similar analysis of the control of heart rate was performed for the rat, dog, and human subject and compared with that of the rabbit. The results show that the resting rabbit heart is under less vagal tone than sympathetic tone as compared with other species. The effects of acute administration of amiodarone on the sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart rate as well as intrinsic heart rate were investigated. Amiodarone decreased the heart rate, which resulted from a direct effect on the sinoatrial (SA) node. In addition, it attenuated the vagal as well as the sympathetic effects on the SA node. The effect on vagal component was greater. Further, the effects of other antiarrhythmic drugs on the electrocardiographic PP and PR intervals were studied. The usefulness of this model for the analysis of the effects of antiarrhythmic drugs is presented.", 
    "66": "The role of beta 1-receptors in the hemodynamic response to beta 2-stimulation was assessed in seven healthy subjects by infusion of the selective beta 2-agonist terbutaline both with and without selective beta 1-blockade by atenolol (50 mg). Infusion of terbutaline increased heart rate (+28 bpm) and indices of left ventricular (LV) performance associated with a marked decrease in LV end-systolic wall stress. The LV end-diastolic dimension remained unchanged despite the tachycardia, suggesting that venous return had increased. Systolic blood pressure increased, whereas total peripheral resistance and diastolic blood pressure decreased. Atenolol pretreatment caused the hemodynamic changes expected of beta 1-blockade but did not blunt the effects of terbutaline on heart rate, peripheral resistance, or venous return. Increases after terbutaline in LV performance and systolic blood pressure were significantly blunted by atenolol. Stimulation of beta 1-receptors therefore appears to play no role in the chronotropic and only a moderate role in the inotropic response after infusion of a beta 2-agonist. Alternative mechanisms for the cardiac changes with terbutaline include (1) withdrawal of vagal tone, (2) decrease in afterload, and (3) stimulation of cardiac beta 2-receptors.", 
    "67": "Sixty patients with theophylline toxicity were hospitalized during a 2-year period. Eleven patients had hypercalcemia; their calcium levels returned to normal as theophylline levels fell to therapeutic or subtherapeutic levels. Serum calcium levels also fell significantly in three additional patients with theophylline toxicity, although the initial serum calcium concentration was not outside normal limits. A significant increase in serum calcium levels associated with therapeutic levels of theophylline in normal volunteers was reversed by propranolol. It appears that theophylline causes elevation of serum calcium by a system subject to beta-adrenergic regulation.", 
    "68": "Desmethylimipramine (DMI) administered once daily for 10 days caused a significant decrease in beta-adrenergic receptor binding, as measured by quantitative autoradiography in discrete brain regions. The decrease was observed 72 h after the last injection throughout the cortex and in hippocampus but not in other regions, much richer in beta-receptors, such as the caudate, olfactory tubercle, superior colliculus, dorsomedial thalamus, substantia nigra, or pineal. The same paradigm did not affect imipramine (IMI) binding in the cortex or in regions with high concentrations of IMI binding sites. DMI binding was not decreased, either. Significant increases in DMI binding were observed in frontal cortex and in the ventral aspect of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. We conclude that a reduction in tricyclic binding is not a general phenomenon following chronic treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, and changes in binding, when they do occur, are not correlated with areas of high binding site density.", 
    "69": "Histamine is an impressive modulator of immune functions at least via its effects on lymphoid cells. Its in vivo effects will not be used practically as long as they produce the profound cardiovascular and pulmonary effects for which the drug is known. A series of 13 congener derivatives and conjugates of histamine was constructed and was tested to investigate whether chemical alterations would result in pharmacologic actions on leukocytes that were more potent and effect specific than histamine. The new compounds, which contained spacer groups of varying lengths between ligand and carrier and with various aromatic modifying groups, showed potencies widely different from histamine when tested in natural suppressor cells. Some compounds showed selective effects on natural suppressor cells in that they were inactive on myocardial tissue, whereas other compounds were selectively active on the myocardium. Some compounds augmented the suppressive capacity of natural suppressor cells in mixed leukocyte reactions via H1 receptors. Our scheme might be more widely extrapolated to other low m.w. immune modulators in an attempt to make them lymphocyte specific. The data also encourage the in vivo testing of selected histamine analogues as selective modulators of immunity. Some of these modulators might be experimentally useful in vivo because they may lack actions in other tissues.", 
    "70": "Hepatocytes from regenerating rat liver show an enhanced epinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP response, which may be involved in triggering of the cell proliferation. We have determined adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in hepatocytes isolated at various time points after partial hepatectomy. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors, measured by binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) to a particulate fraction prepared from isolated hepatocytes, increased rapidly after partial hepatectomy as compared with sham-operated or untreated controls. The maximal increase, which was observed at 48 h, was between 5- and 6-fold (from approximately 1 800 to approximately 10 500 sites per cell). Thereafter, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors decreased gradually. Competition experiments indicated beta 2-type receptors. Parallelism was found between the change in the number of beta 2-adrenergic receptors and the isoproterenol-responsive adenylate cyclase activity. The number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, determined by binding of [3H]prazosin, was transiently lowered by about 35% at 18-24 h, with no significant change in Kd. Although the results of this study do not exclude the possibility of post-receptor events, they suggest that the increased number of beta 2-adrenergic receptors is a major factor responsible for the enhanced catecholamine-responsive adenylate cyclase activity in regenerating liver.", 
    "71": "In 12 chloralose anaesthetized dogs plasma concentration of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide (IR-ANP) was measured using a radioimmunoassay. Plasma IR-ANP was 74 +/- 4.8 pg/mL (mean +/- SE) and increased by 39 +/- 4.1 pg/mL when left atrial pressure was increased by 10 cm H2O during partial mitral obstruction. Observation of the time course of the changes in IR-ANP during atrial distension showed that IR-ANP was increased within 2 min of atrial distension and declined after atrial distension, with a half-time of 4.5 min. The time course of the changes in IR-ANP was unaffected by vagotomy or administration of atenolol. Maximum electrical stimulation of the right ansa subclavia failed to produce any change in IR-ANP. IR-ANP was higher in coronary sinus plasma than in femoral arterial plasma confirming that the heart was the source of the IR-ANP. The results support the hypothesis that IR-ANP is released from the heart by a direct effect of stretch of the atrial wall rather than by a neural or humoral mechanism involving a reflex from atrial receptors.", 
    "72": "Atrial natriuretic peptide is a potent diuretic hormone secreted by the atria in response to volume expansion. We examined the effect of resting tension on atrial natriuretic peptide secretion by rat atria superfused in vitro. Left atria were hooked between an electrode and force transducer and superfused with medium 199. The atria were studied at a pacing frequency of 0 or 3 Hz. Atrial natriuretic peptide content of the superfusate was measured by radioimmunoassay. In nonpaced and paced atria, increasing resting tension three- to five-fold caused immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide secretion to increase by 35 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6, p less than 0.01) and 30 +/- 3% (n = 4, p less than 0.01), respectively. Lowering resting tension by 50% in nonpaced and paced atria lowered immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide secretion by 30 +/- 3% (n = 7, p less than 0.01) and 24 +/- 3% (n = 6, p less than 0.01), respectively. To exclude the possibility that release of norepinephrine or acetylcholine from endogenous nerve endings was mediating this effect, the atria were superfused with the combination of propranolol 0.1 microM, phentolamine 1.0 microM, and atropine 10 microM. These concentrations of the antagonists were 125-fold or higher than their Kd for binding to their respective receptors. The antagonists did not block the rise in immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide secretion; neither did they inhibit an established rise in immunoreactive atrial natriuretic peptide secretion induced by increasing the resting tension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "We studied 18 patients with essential tremor for difficulty with handwriting, drinking, eating, fine manipulations, and embarrassment. Propranolol and primidone reduced the amplitude of both postural and kinetic tremor. Handwriting, drinking, and eating were improved with therapy, but fine manipulations and motor performance on tapping and pegboard tests were unaltered. Embarrassment remained unchanged. Essential tremor is not a benign condition; disability can be only partly reversed with drug therapy.", 
    "74": "Since arterial hypertension is one the main risk factors of coronary atherosclerosis, the association hypertension-coronary disease is a frequent one. Moreover, arterial hypertension aggravates the coronary disease and this association is therefore of very poor prognosis. However, this prognosis seems to improve with early and adapted treatment based largely at this time on beta-blockers and calcium inhibitors.", 
    "75": "The mechanisms by which isoprenaline and prenalterol increase heart rate and myocardial contractile force were investigated in conscious instrumented dogs. Isoprenaline (0.1 micrograms/kg/min/10 min) increased both heart rate (+98 +/- 14%) and contractility (+36 +/- 5%) and decreased diastolic blood pressure. beta 1-Adrenoceptor blockade abolished the isoprenaline induced increase in contractility whereas the induced tachycardia was reduced by approximately 50%. Either beta 2-blockade, which abolished the hypotensive effect of isoprenaline or ganglionic blockade, which abolished the isoprenaline-induced activation of sino aortic baroreflexes, strongly reduced (-67 +/- 8%) the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia but did not markedly alter the increase in contractility. However, the isoprenaline-induced increase in contractility was potentiated by methylatropine (+83 +/- 12%) whereas the simultaneous tachycardia was less marked than before methylatropine. In the same dogs, prenalterol (2 micrograms/kg/min/5 min) increased contractility (+38 +/- 5%) to the same extent as isoprenaline but induced a lesser increase in heart rate (+23 +/- 3%) and had no effect on aortic pressure. These effects were not significantly modified by pretreatments with either ganglionic or beta 2-blockades but were abolished by beta 1-blockade. After methylatropine the prenalterol-induced increase in heart rate was not modified but the increase in contractility was potentiated (+63 +/- 11%). We conclude that whereas indirect activation of arterial baroreflexes through hypotension markedly contributes to the isoprenaline-induced increase in heart rate, the simultaneous increase in cardiac inotropism is only dependent upon direct beta 1-adrenoceptor activation by isoprenaline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
