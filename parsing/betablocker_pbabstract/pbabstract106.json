    "0": "The treatment goal of patients with arterial hypertension is to reduce the blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg with the aim to lower the risk of subsequent cardiovascular diseases and to prolong patient's longevity. There are five main classes for blood pressure treatment: ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. All these antihypertensive drugs have in common that they are able to lower the arterial blood pressure in a similar range. If drugs have similar effects, those with additional beneficial effects on patient's comorbidity should be preferred. Some antihypertensive drugs such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS) additionally have organ protective properties. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be preferred in patients with a high cardiovascular risk such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. A preferred approach is the initial prescription of a low dose combination to bring more hypertensive patients to their target blood pressure. Most combination drugs contain a thiazide diuretic. A better combination especially for diabetics seems to be a calcium channel blocker together with a RAAS inhibitor. A possible combination for patients with coronary heart disease or heart failure is a RAAS inhibitor combined with a beta-receptor blocker.",

    "5": "Autoimmune response against myocardial antigens is evident in numerous heart diseases. Both the induction of an autoimmune response and the pathogenesis of autoimmune heart diseases are not fully understood. The humoral immune response may play an important role via induction of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, alteration of myocardial mechanical and electrophysiological functions, and activation of the complement system and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Anti-\u03b2-1 adrenergic receptor antibodies appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and Chagas disease. Herein, we review the current knowledge relating to anti-\u03b2-1 adrenergic receptor antibodies: their potential role in heart diseases and the potential benefits of a targeted therapy against their apparently destructive effects. Patients with dilated cardiomyopathy with circulating stimulatory anti-\u03b2-1 adrenergic receptor autoantibodies are probably at a higher risk for adverse outcome and should be treated with adrenergic receptor antagonists, and possibly with immunotherapy. Further research is required to determine which patients will gain additional clinical benefits from anti-autoantibody-targeted therapy.", 
    "6": "In airway smooth muscle, protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in a number of functional responses including the regulation of contractility. However, the exact role of PKC on bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) contraction is still unclear. In the present study, to determine the role of PKC activation in the BSM contraction, the effects of phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu, a direct PKC activator) on BSM tone were examined in the absence and presence of K(+)-induced depolarization stimulation. The force development was not evoked by treatment with 1 \u00b5M PDBu alone. However, a strong contraction was induced by PDBu during high K(+) contraction. The contraction induced by PDBu during high K(+) stimulation was significantly abolished by pretreatment with nicardipine, an L-type voltage dependent Ca(2+) channel blocker. In RT-PCR analysis, mRNAs of PKC\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b7 and \u03b8 isoforms were detected in mouse BSM. G\u00f66976 (an inhibitor of PKCs \u03b1 and \u03b2) and rottlerin (an inhibitor of PKC\u03b4) significantly but partially inhibited the PDBu-induced BSM contraction during K(+) stimulation. GF109203X (an inhibitor of PKCs \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b5) completely inhibited the PDBu-induced contraction during K(+) stimulation. In conclusion, it is suggested that the PDBu-induced BSM contraction is dependent on an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+). Furthermore, it is possible that both cPKC and nPKC(s) participate in the PDBu-induced contraction of mouse BSM during K(+) stimulation.",

In this study, we have investigated the effects of stress-related hormones on interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion and proliferation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. The effects of norepinephrine (NE), and cortisol were studied in SCC9, SCC15, and SCC25 cells and effects of isoproterenol in SCC9 and SCC25 cells. Real-time PCR studies revealed constitutive \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) expression in the SCC9, SCC15, and SCC25 cells. The results showed that NE and isoproterenol significantly enhanced IL-6 mRNA expression and protein production in supernatants of SCC9 and SCC25 cells. Physiological stress levels of NE and isoproterenol (10 \u03bcM) at 1 h elicited the most robust IL-6 increase. Regarding IL-6 secretion, 10 \u03bcM NE induced a 5-fold increase at 1 h, 3.7-fold increase at 6 h, and 3.2-fold at 24 h in SCC9 cells. These effects were blocked by the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, supporting a role for \u03b2-ARs in IL-6 secretion. The effects of cortisol varied according to the hormone concentration. Pharmacological concentrations of cortisol (1000 nM) inhibited IL-6 production by SCC9 and SCC25 cells. Cortisol dose that simulates stress conditions (10 nM) tended to increase IL-6 expression in SCC9 cells. Hormonal doses that simulate stress conditions (10 \u03bcM NE, at 6 h in SCC9 and SCC15 cells and 10 nM cortisol, at 48 h in SCC15 cells) stimulated increased cell proliferation. Treatment of SCC9 cells with IL-6 neutralizing ab (10 \u03bcg/mL) partially inhibited NE-induced proliferation. Finally, 20 OSCC biopsies were shown to express \u03b21- and \u03b22-ARs. These findings suggest that stress hormones can affect oral cancer cells behavior.",

The A-V nodal conduction times, refractoriness, discontinuous conduction (\u2265 40 ms atrial-His interval 'jump'), and inducibility of AVNRT or reciprocating beats were compared. The A-V nodal conduction times were longer: (i) through the Ri than Li, (ii) in patients than controls, and (iii) in baseline than after AUB--at slow rates in both groups and at fast rates in patients through the right input only (P < 0.05-0.001). A significantly longer slow pathway effective refractory period was demonstrated through the Li than the Ri in patients in baseline (P < 0.05). The discontinuous conduction was demonstrated 94 times in 25 of 29 (83%) patients and 15 times in 6 of 15 (40%) controls (P < 0.01), and was most frequently encountered with the Ri testing.

Validation of the microchip method was performed using bufuralol 1-hydroxylation via CYP450 enzymes as the model reaction. The metabolite, 1-hydroxybufuralol, was easily separated from the substrate (R(s)=0.5) with very good detection sensitivity (LOD=9.3nM), linearity (range: 50-500nM, r(2)=0.9997), and repeatability (RSD(Area)=10.3%, RSD(Migrationtime)=2.5% at 80nM concentration without internal standard). The kinetic parameters of bufuralol 1-hydroxylation determined by the microchip capillary electrophoresis (CE)-ESI/mass spectrometry (MS) method, were comparable to the values presented in literature as well as to the values determined by in-house liquid chromatography (LC)-UV. In addition to enzyme kinetics, metabolic profiling was demonstrated using authentic urine samples from healthy volunteers after intake of either tramadol or paracetamol. As a result, six metabolites of tramadol and four metabolites of paracetamol, including both phase I oxidation products and phase II conjugation products, were detected and separated from each other within 30-35s. Before analysis, the urine samples were pre-treated with on-chip, on-line liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) and the results were compared to those obtained from urine samples pre-treated with conventional C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE, off-chip cartridges). On the basis of our results, the SU-8 CE-ESI/MS microchips incorporating on-chip sample pre-treatment, injection, separation, and ESI/MS detection were proven as efficient and versatile tools for drug metabolism research.",

Well understanding physiological properties, including drug-metabolizing enzymes, of monkeys should increase the accuracy of the extrapolation. The present study was performed to compare regio- and stereoselectivity in the oxidation of propranolol (PL), a chiral substrate, by cytochrome P450 2D (CYP2D) enzymes among humans, cynomolgus monkeys and marmosets. Complimentary DNAs encoding human CYP2D6, cynomolgus monkey CYP2D17 and marmoset CYP2D19 were cloned, and their proteins expressed in a yeast cell expression system. The regio- and stereoselective oxidation of PL enantiomers by yeast cell microsomal fractions were compared. In terms of efficiency of expression in the system, the holo-proteins ranked CYP2D6=CYP2D17>CYP2D19. This may be caused by the bulky side chain of the amino acid residue at position 119 (leucine for CYP2D19 vs. valine for CYP2D6 and CYP2D17), which can disturb the incorporation of the heme moiety into the active-site cavity. PL enantiomers were oxidized by all of the enzymes mainly into 4-hydroxyproranolol (4-OH-PL), followed by 5-OH-PL and N-desisopropylpropranolol (NDP). In the kinetic analysis, apparent K(m) values were commonly in the \u03bcM range and substrate enantioselectivity of R-PL<S-PL was observed in both K(m) and V(max) values for the formation of the three metabolites from PL enantiomers. The activity to produce NDP tended to be higher for the monkey enzymes, particularly CYP2D17, than for the human enzyme. These results indicate that in the oxidation of PL enantiomers by CYP2D enzymes, stereoselectivity is similar but regioselectivity is different between humans and monkeys.",

Recent meta analysis of various hypertension trials have brought to light the inferiority of BB compared to other antihypertensives as a first line monotherapy agent. Combination of BB with dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) has been especially effective in smooth control of BP. Combination of diuretics with BB should be avoided in patients with dyslipidaemia and in those prone to develop diabetes. BB can be combined with vasodilators and alpha blockers with good therapeutic benefit. BB with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) is not an ideal combination as both the drugs act in the renin-angiotensin system.

Identifying LVH not only helps in the prognostication but also in the choice of therapeutic drugs. The prevalence of LVH is age linked and has a direct correlation to the severity of hypertension. Adequate control of blood pressure, most importantly central aortic pressure and blocking the effects of cardiomyocyte stimulatory growth factors like Angiotensin II helps in regression of LVH. Among the various antihypertensives ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are more potent than other drugs in regressing LVH. Beta blockers especially the newer cardio selective ones do still have a role in regressing LVH albeit a minor one. A meta-analysis of various studies on LVH regression shows many lacunae. There have been no consistent criteria for defining LVH and documenting LVH regression. This article reviews current evidence on the role of Beta Blockers in LVH regression.",

They are important components of treatment in the management of VT storms, Atrial Fibrillation, arrhythmias during pregnancy, arrhythmias associated with congenital heart disease, Long QT syndrome, arrhythmias in cardiomyopathies and post-cardiac surgery arrhythmias.The choice of drug, dose and route of administration depends on the type of arrhythmia and clinical presentation and demographics of the patient.",

However, concern about side-effects may deter clinicians from prescribing these life-saving drugs. In reality, absolute contraindications are rare. Only 3-5% of patients are intolerant because of hypotension or bradycardia. Data from randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies show that most patients eligible to receive BB tolerate them well. BB are not contraindicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in fact, these patients also benefit because of their high cardiovascular risk. In patients with COPD, as in the elderly, BB should be started at a low dose and uptitrated slowly. Monitoring of lung function during initiation is important, as undiagnosed coexistent asthma could be revealed. When patients are unaware of the drug in use, erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported no more often with BB than with any other drug prescribed for heart failure or hypertension. However, when patients are aware of the potential side-effects of BB, the resultant anxiety may cause ED. Patients should be reassured that BB prolong life and in the great majority are not the cause of ED, which may rather be related to the underlying disease (diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis).",

Subsequently BB proved to be beneficial in post-thrombolytic MI in long-term use. In stable angina BB gives good symptomatic relief primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. In the set-up of unstable angina/non-ST elevation MI they prevent arrhythmia and progression to ST elevation MI. BB have also been shown to retard the progression of atherosclerosis. In congestive cardiac failure (CCF) they are now the first-line drugs with ACE inhibitors to impart prognostic benefit. Their role in improving outcome of cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries has found good evidence and recommendation.

They are the mainstay of treatment in ischemic heart disease, heart failure, high risk coronary artery disease and arrhythmias, as their importance in these compelling indications are well-established. However, the efficacy and relevance of beta blockers in the treatment of uncomplicated hypertension have been questioned because the traditional agents were deemed not atpar with drugs from other classes in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. Although atenolol and other traditional agent s have lost favor, the other cardioselective agents have been shown to be at least as efficacious in hypertension as the other classes of drugs. Their use in hypertension therapy should continue, especially in young and diabetic individuals where high sympathetic tone and high renin levels are the primary features. The newer-generation vasodilating beta blockers have favorable hemodynamic and metabolic properties, better side effect profile and improved efficacy in treating uncomplicated hypertension. With the advent of these new agents, the beta blocker class should remain as a viable first-line option in antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "35": "The life-time risk of developing HF is about 20% (40% if hypertension present). With increasing longevity in the developed world the burden of HF (hospitalisation) is set to increase over the next 10-20 years. CAD and hypertension are the two main causes of HF; CAD (and obesity) in the case of systolic HF and hypertension in the case of diastolic HF (mainly in the elderly). BB have become the corner-stone (alongside ACE-inhibitors) in the treatment of systolic HF. Bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol (on an ACE-inhibitor background) have reduced all-cause death by 34-5%. The presence of intrinsic sympathomemetic activity (xamoterol, bucindolol, nebivolol) diminishes efficacy in the treatment of systolic HF. First-line bisoprolol has proved \"non-inferior\" to first-line enalapril in reducing all-cause death and is probably superior in reducing sudden death. The main mode of action of BB in treating systolic HF is inhibition of chronic beta-1 stimulation-induced myocardial apoptosis/necrosis/inflammation. The combination of pure beta-1 blockade (low-dose bisoprolol) and pure beta-2 blockade (clenbuterol) may prove invaluable in the treatment of end-stage systolic HF (thus avoiding cardiac transplantation). The appropriate treatment of diastolic HF has yet to be determined. Beta-blockade is effective in the prevention of HF i) in the post-MI period and ii) as first-line agents in the treatment of young/middle-aged hypertension and as second-line agents (to first-line diuretics) in the treatment of elderly systolic hypertension. BB are highly effective in reversing LVH in young/middle-aged hypertensives (LVH pre-disposes to HF in young/middle-aged hypertension) and are (bisoprolol) at least as good as ACE-inhibitors. Choice of BB is important as benefit is not a class-effect. ISA (xamoterol, bucindolol, nebivolol) markedly diminishes efficacy. The choice is between bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate and carvedilol for optimal efficacy. Adverse reactions are associated, mainly, with beta-2 blockade and alpha-blockade. Thus non-selective (e.g. propranolol) or modestly beta-1 selective (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol) are associated with metabolic disturbance, bronchospasm, epinephrine/hypertensive interaction (with cigarette-smoking or insulin-induced hypoglycaemia), while the possession of alpha-blocking activity (e.g. carvedilol) is associated with dizziness and postural hypotension. The possession of beta-2 blockade, particularly if combined with alpha-blockade, is associated with an increased occurrence of sexual dysfunction. Lipophilic BB like propranolol and metoprolol appear in high concentrations in human brain tissue and are associated with side-effects such as insomnia, dreams and nightmares.",

    "42": "Obesity and insulin resistance-related proteinuria is associated with oxidative stress and impaired tissue bioavailable nitric oxide. Recent data suggest that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-mediated oxidative injury to the proximal tubule, like that seen in the glomerulus, contributes to proteinuria in insulin-resistant states. The vasodilator \u03b2-blocker nebivolol reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity, increases bioavailable nitric oxide, and improves insulin sensitivity. To test the hypothesis that a treatment strategy that reduces oxidative stress and attenuates obesity-associated increases in glomerular and proximal tubule derived protein, we treated young Zucker obese (ZO) and age-matched Zucker lean male rats with nebivolol (10 mg \u00b7 kg(-1) \u00b7 d(-1)) for 21 d. Compared with Zucker lean, ZO controls exhibited increased proteinuria and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, reductions in systemic insulin sensitivity in association with increased renal renin, (pro)renin receptor, angiotensin II type 1 receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor immunostaining, oxidative stress, and glomerular tubular structural abnormalities that were substantially improved with in vivo nebivolol treatment. Nebivolol treatment also led to improvements in glomerular podocyte foot-process effacement and improvement in podocyte-specific proteins (nephrin and synaptopodin) as well as proximal tubule-specific proteins (megalin and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2) and proximal tubule ultrastructural remodeling in the ZO kidney. Our findings support the notion that obesity and insulin resistance lead to increased glomerulotubular oxidative stress and resultant glomerular and tubular sources of excess urine protein. Furthermore, the results of this study suggest the beneficial effect of nebivolol on proteinuria was derived from improvements in weight and insulin sensitivity and reductions in renal oxidative stress in a state of obesity and insulin resistance.",

    "47": "The objectives were to characterize propranolol hydrochloride-loaded matrix tablets using guar gum, xanthan gum, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as rate-retarding polymers. Tablets were prepared by wet granulation using these polymers alone and in combination, and physical properties of the granules and tablets were studied. Drug release was evaluated in simulated gastric and intestinal media. Rugged tablets with appropriate physical properties were obtained. Empirical and semi-empirical models were fit to release data to elucidate release mechanisms. Guar gum alone was unable to control drug release until a 1:3 drug/gum ratio, where the release pattern matched a Higuchi profile. Matrix tablets incorporating HPMC provided near zero-order release over 12 h and erosion was a contributing mechanism. Combinations of HPMC with guar or xanthan gum resulted in a Higuchi release profile, revealing the dominance of the high viscosity gel formed by HPMC. As the single rate-retarding polymer, xanthan gum retarded release over 24 h and the Higuchi model best fit the data. When mixed with guar gum, at 10% or 20% xanthan levels, xanthan gum was unable to control release. However, tablets containing 30% guar gum and 30% xanthan gum behaved as if xanthan gum was the sole rate-retarding gum and drug was released by Fickian diffusion. Release profiles from certain tablets match 12-h literature profiles and the 24-h profile of Inderal(\u00ae) LA. The results confirm that guar gum, xanthan gum, and HPMC can be used for the successful preparation of sustained release oral propranolol hydrochoride tablets.",

We also determined the inhibitory effect of metoclopramide, a dopamine D\u2082-receptor antagonist, on increases in the salivary amylase activity induced by apomorphine or granisetron, a 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist, on LiCl-induced increased salivary amylase activity. Isoprenaline (0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) produced an increase in salivary amylase and the increase was inhibited by the \u03b2(\u00bd)-AR antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and \u03b2\u2081-AR antagonist atenolol (2 mg/kg, s.c.) but not by the \u03b2\u2082-AR antagonist butoxamine (8 mg/kg, s.c.). The increased amylase activity induced by cisplatin (15 mg/kg, i.v.), apomorphine (3 mg/kg, s.c.), or LiCl (120 mg/kg, i.p.) was inhibited significantly by atenolol (2 mg/kg, s.c.) but not by butoxamine (8 mg/kg, s.c.). In addition, increases in amylase activities induced by apomorphine and LiCl were inhibited significantly by metoclopramide (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and granisetron (3 mg/kg, i.v.), respectively. These results suggest that salivary amylase secretion induced by various emetogens is involved in \u03b2\u2081-adrenoceptor activity and that salivary amylase activity is useful to detect emetogens with no direct \u03b2\u2081-AR activation in rats, a species that does not exhibit vomiting.",

    "52": "Peripheral ischemia is commonly associated with an increase in tissue ATP concentration and a decrease in tissue pH. Although in vitro data suggest that low tissue pH can affect ATP-binding affinities to P2 receptors, the mechanistic relationship between ATP and low pH on peripheral nociception has not been fully examined. This study was designed to investigate the potential role of an acidified environment on intraplantar \u03b1\u03b2meATP-induced peripheral pain responses in rats. The mechanical allodynia (MA) produced by injection of \u03b1\u03b2meATP was significantly increased in animals that received the drug diluted in pH 4.0 saline compared to those that received the drug diluted in pH 7.0 saline. Moreover, animals injected with \u03b1\u03b2meATP (100 nmol) in pH 4.0 saline developed thermal hyperalgesia (TH), which did not occur in animals treated with \u03b1\u03b2meATP diluted in pH 7.0 saline. To elucidate which receptors were involved in this pH-related facilitation of \u03b1\u03b2meATP-induced MA and TH, rats were pretreated with PPADS (P2 antagonist), TNP-ATP (P2X antagonist), MRS2179 (P2Y1 antagonist), AMG9810 (TRPV1 antagonist) or amiloride (ASIC blocker). Both PPADS and TNP-ATP dose-dependently blocked pH-facilitated MA, while TH was significantly reduced by pre-treatment with MRS2179 or AMG9810. Moreover, amiloride injection significantly reduced low pH-induced facilitation of \u03b1\u03b2meATP-mediated MA, but not TH. These results demonstrate that low tissue pH facilitates ATP-mediated MA via the activation of P2X receptors and ASICs, whereas TH induced by ATP under low pH conditions is mediated by the P2Y1 receptor and TRPV1, but not ASIC. Thus distinct mechanisms are responsible for the development of MA and TH under conditions of tissue acidosis and increased ATP.", 
    "53": "Nebivolol is a selective \u03b2\u2081-adrenoceptor antagonist which, in addition, displays endothelium-dependent vasodilating properties in humans and other species. \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptors have been proposed to be a molecular target of nebivolol-induced vasodilatation. Therefore, we have investigated possible \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptor agonism by nebivolol for relaxation of the human and rat urinary bladder (prototypical \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptor-mediated responses) as well as for cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes. Nebivolol concentration-dependently relaxed both human and rat isolated urinary bladder strips but with low potency, similar to that reported for vasodilatation. However, nebivolol-induced bladder relaxation in either species was not inhibited by the \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59,230A (10\u03bcM), although this compound inhibited the isoprenaline-induced relaxation with the expected potency. In radioligand binding studies nebivolol had lower affinity for human \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptors than the other two \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes, but this low affinity was in line with its potency to relax the bladder or isolated blood vessels. In functional studies nebivolol even in high concentrations did not stimulate cAMP formation via any of the three cloned human \u03b2-adrenoceptors or in rat bladder smooth muscle cells. Taken together these data demonstrate that nebivolol can relax not only vascular but also urinary bladder smooth muscle. However, they do not support the hypothesis that nebivolol is an agonist at cloned human \u03b2\u2083-adrenoceptors or in rat or human urinary bladder.",

Pancreatic islet cells were primarily isolated from rats and cultured for the experiments. The cells were loaded with Fluo-3/AM, the indicator of [Ca(2+)](i), and the intensity of Fluo-3 was measured using confocal microscope. The islet \u03b2-cells were identified by immunocytochemical staining with insulin antibody after recording. The drugs were given by perfusion system. The results showed that linoleic acid (20 \u03bcmol/L) stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase with the first peak increase and the following plateau increase. Linoleic acid-stimulated [Ca(2+)](i) increase was partly inhibited by removal of extracellular calcium and by transient receptor potential (TRP) channel blocker, La(3+), and it was totally blocked by exhaustion of intracellular calcium stores and inhibition of phospholipase C. It is concluded that linoleic acid stimulates [Ca(2+)](i) increase in islet \u03b2-cells through both extracellular calcium influx via TRP channels and calcium release from intracellular calcium stores.",

    "60": "Expedition physicians should be prepared to respond to traumatic stress disorders following wilderness disasters. Stress disorder symptoms include re-experiencing the traumatic event, avoiding stimuli associated with the traumatic event, and increased physical arousal. These symptoms can also be seen in healthy individuals, and should only lead to disorder diagnosis when they cause distress or impairment. Treatment options for stress disorders include observation, psychological interventions, and medication. Approximately half of those with diagnosable stress disorders will return to nondiagnosable status over time without therapeutic intervention. Psychological interventions with empirical support concentrate on providing either noninvasive support in the short term, such as psychological first aid (PFA), or more long-term controlled re-experiencing of the precipitating trauma, such as many exposure-based therapies. Exposure-based treatments can result in temporary increases in symptoms before long-term gains are realized, so they are not recommended for wilderness settings. Medications to treat stress disorders include benzodiazepines, propranolol, and antidepressant medications. Benzodiazepines are often carried in wilderness first aid kits, but they provide very limited stress disorder symptom relief. Propranolol is being explored as a method of preventing traumatic stress disorders, but the data are not currently conclusive. Antidepressant medications are a good long-term strategy for stress disorder treatment, but they are of limited utility in wilderness settings as they are unlikely to be included in expedition medical kits and require approximately 4 weeks of administration for symptom reduction. Recommendations for wilderness treatment of stress disorders focus on increasing knowledge of stress disorder diagnosis and PFA.", 
    "61": "Different ethylene vinyl acetate grades (EVA9, EVA15, EVA28 and EVA40 having a VA content of 9%, 15%, 28% and 40%, respectively) were characterized via differential scanning calorimetry. Glass transition temperature (T(g)), polymer crystallinity, melting point and polymer flexibility were positively influenced by the vinyl acetate content. The processability of EVA-based formulations produced by means of hot-melt extrusion (2mm die) was evaluated in function of VA content, extrusion temperature (60-140\u00b0C) and metoprolol tartrate (MPT, used as model drug) concentration (10-60%). Matrices containing 50% MPT resulted in smooth-surfaced extrudates, whereas at 60% drug content severe surface defects (shark skinning) were observed. Drug release from EVA/MPT matrices (50/50, w/w) was affected by the EVA grades: 90% after 24h for EVA15 and 28, while EVA9 and EVA40 formulations released 80% and 60%, respectively. Drug release also depended on drug loading and extrusion temperature. For all systems, the total matrix porosity (measured by X-ray tomography) was decreased after dissolution due to elastic rearrangement of the polymer. However, the largest porosity reduction was observed for EVA40 matrices as partial melting of the structure (melt onset temperature: 34.7\u00b0C) also contributed (thereby reducing the drug release pathway and yielding the lowest release rate from EVA40 formulations). The Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) used to evaluate the stability of EVA during gastrointestinal transit showed that EVA was not modified during GI transit, nor did it affect the GI ecosystem following oral administration.", 
    "62": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous and competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase. Plasma level of ADMA is elevated in patients with hypertension. In these patients, plasma ADMA levels are correlated with the severity of endothelial dysfunction. Nebivolol, a highly selective blocker of beta1-adrenergic receptors, is the only beta-blocker known to induce vascular production of NO. There is little data on the effect of nebivolol on ADMA system in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In this study SHR and age-matched Wister-Kyoto (WKY) rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: SHR treated with nebivolol (8 mg/kg/day, i.g.); SHR treated with Atenolol (80 mg/kg/day, i.g.); SHR control group; WKY control group. Nebivolol induced an acute and significant reduction in systolic blood pressure in SHR. Compared with WKY, plasma ADMA was elevated significantly, while NOS activity and NO were decreased in SHR. In aorta and mesenteric artery of SHR, the expression of eNOS and DDAH 2 reduced, but expression of PRMT 1 increased. And ROS level in aorta also increased. Nebivolol increased plasma NO and NOS activity, attenuated ADMA level. The expression of eNOS and DDAH 2 were up-regulated, PRMT 1 expression were down-regulated after nebivolol treatment. Nebivolol also reduced aortic ROS. Our results indicate that nebivolol reduces plasma ADMA level in SHR by increasing its hydrolysis and reducing its generation. Nebivolol affects ADMA system not only from metabolism but also from generation. The influence of nebivolol on ADMA is complex, and the mechanism remains to be investigated.",

On day 8, the animals were anaesthetized with pentobarbitone and prepared for systemic haemodynamic study. Dose-response relationships for the elevation of mean arterial pressure or change in heart rate (HR) in response to intravenous injections of noradrenaline (NA), phenylephrine (PE), methoxamine (ME) and Ang II were determined. 3\u2002Losartan or the combination of losartan with carvedilol blunted vasopressor responses to ME and Ang II. Dose-response relationships for agonist action on HR were significantly inhibited by all treatments except for the combination of losartan and carvedilol on the decrease in HR induced by PE. Carvedilol decreased vasopressor responses to NA, PE and Ang II, and HR responses to NA, ME and Ang II. Combination treatment produced similar effects to losartan on the vasopressor and HR responses but had a greater effect on vasopressor responses to ME and Ang II, and on HR responses to NA and Ang II than carvedilol alone. 4\u2002It is concluded that peripheral vasoconstriction induced by Ang II is partly mediated by adrenergic action and that the vasopressor responses to adrenergic agonists depend on an intact RAS. These observations suggest an interactive relationship between RAS and SNS in determining systemic haemodynamic responses in 'normal' rats.",

A full history should be taken and clinical examination carried out. Patients with a past history of MI, or those with a high plasma BNP, should be referred to be seen within two weeks for echocardiography and specialist opinion. The specialist should determine: whether heart failure is present; its likely aetiology; precipitating factors; type of cardiac dysfunction; correctable causes; relevant comorbidity, and prognosis. Those with no history of MI but an elevated plasma BNP should be referred to be seen within six weeks for such assessment. Older adults, and patients with peripheral vascular disease, erectile dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, interstitial pulmonary disease and COPD without reversibility should be considered for beta-blocker therapy. A start low, go slow approach is recommended, with clinical review after each titration. Monitoring should include a clinical assessment, medication review, and a check of renal function as a minimum. Such a review should take place at least six monthly but may have to be much more frequent if there is a change in drug prescription or clinical status.

Large observational studies, retrospective subgroup analyses and meta-analyses of clinical trials in systolic heart failure, and recently published randomized studies have provided data supporting the use of beta-blockers as a baseline therapy in heart failure in the elderly. Despite the available evidence about beta-blockers, this therapy is still less frequently used in elderly compared to younger patients. Nebivolol is a third-generation cardioselective beta-blocker with L-arginine/nitric oxide-induced vasodilatory properties, approved in Europe and several other countries for the treatment of essential hypertension, and in Europe for the treatment of stable, mild, or moderate chronic heart failure, in addition to standard therapies in elderly patients aged 70 years old or older. The effects of nebivolol on left ventricular function in elderly patients with chronic heart failure (ENECA) and the study of effects of nebivolol intervention on outcomes and rehospitalization in seniors with heart failure (SENIORS) have been specifically aimed to assess the efficacy of beta-blockade in elderly heart failure patients. The results of these two trials demonstrate that nebivolol is well tolerated and effective in reducing mortality and morbidity in older patients, and that the beneficial clinical effect is present also in patients with mildly reduced ejection fraction. Moreover, nebivolol appears to be significantly cost-effective when prescribed in these patients. However, further targeted studies are needed to better define the efficacy as well as safety profile in frail and older patients with comorbid diseases.",

A simple therapeutic approach involving discontinuation of beta-blockers remarkably alleviated the symptoms such as left ventricular ejection fraction, and improved the chest radiography and laboratory findings; further, atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm. It is important to carefully administer beta-blocker therapy to elderly patients with heart failure, especially after considering cardiac output.",

    "95": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) has been shown to promote arousal and anxiolytic-like effects, as well as facilitation of fear extinction. In rodents, NPS receptors (NPSR) are prominently expressed in brain structures involved in learning and memory. Here, we investigate whether exogenous or endogenous NPS signaling can modulate acquisition, consolidation, or recall of emotional, spatial, and contextual memory traces, using two common behavioral paradigms, inhibitory avoidance (IA) and novel object recognition. In the IA paradigm, immediate and delayed post-training central NPS administration dose dependently enhanced memory retention in mice, indicating that NPS may act during the consolidation phase to enhance long-term memory. In contrast, pre-training or pre-test NPS injections were ineffective, suggesting that NPS had no effect on IA memory acquisition or recall. Peripheral administration of a synthetic NPSR antagonist attenuated NPS-induced IA memory enhancement, showing pharmacological specificity. NPS also enhanced hippocampal-dependent non-aversive memory in the novel object recognition task. In contrast, NPSR knockout mice displayed deficits in IA memory, novel object recognition, and novel place or context recognition, suggesting that activity of the endogenous NPS system is required for memory formation. Blockade of adrenergic signaling by propranolol attenuated NPS-induced memory enhancement in the IA task, indicating involvement of central noradrenergic systems. These results provide evidence for a facilitatory role of NPS in long-term memory, independent of memory content, possibly by acting as a salience signal or as an arousal-promoting factor.",

    "100": "Chloride fluxes are the main contributors to the resting conductance of mammalian skeletal muscle fibers. ClC-1, the most abundant chloride channel isoform in this preparation, is believed to be responsible for this conductance. However, the actual distribution of ClC-1 channels between the surface and transverse tubular system (TTS) membranes has not been assessed in intact muscle fibers. To investigate this issue, we voltageclamped enzymatically dissociated short fibers using a two-microelectrode configuration and simultaneously recorded chloride currents (I(Cl)) and di-8-ANEPPS fluorescence signals to assess membrane potential changes in the TTS. Experiments were conducted in conditions that blocked all but the chloride conductance. Fibers were equilibrated with 40 or 70 mM intracellular chloride to enhance the magnitude of inward I(Cl), and the specific ClC-1 blocker 9-ACA was used to eliminate these currents whenever necessary. Voltage-dependent di-8-ANEPPS signals and I(Cl) acquired before (control) and after the addition of 9-ACA were comparatively assessed. Early after the onset of stimulus pulses, di-8-ANEPPS signals under control conditions were smaller than those recorded in the presence of 9-ACA. We defined as attenuation the normalized time-dependent difference between these signals. Attenuation was discovered to be I(Cl) dependent since its magnitude varied in close correlation with the amplitude and time course of I(Cl). While the properties of I(Cl), and those of the attenuation seen in optical records, could be simultaneously predicted by model simulations when the chloride permeability (P(Cl)) at the surface and TTS membranes were approximately equal, the model failed to explain the optical data if P(Cl) was precluded from the TTS membranes. Since the ratio between the areas of TTS membranes and the sarcolemma is large in mammalian muscle fibers, our results demonstrate that a significant fraction of the experimentally recorded I(Cl) arises from TTS contributions.",

We investigated the effects of hemorrhagic resuscitation with hypertonic saline on cardiac (CSNA) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and the resulting cardiovascular consequences. Studies were performed on conscious sheep instrumented with cardiac (n=7) and renal (n=6) sympathetic nerve recording electrodes and a pulmonary artery flow probe. Hemorrhage (20 ml/kg over 20 min) caused hypotension and tachycardia followed by bradycardia, reduced cardiac output, and abolition of CSNA and RSNA. Resuscitation with intravenous hypertonic saline (1.2 mol/l at 2 ml/kg) caused rapid, dramatic increases in mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and CSNA, but had no effect on RSNA. In contrast, isotonic saline resuscitation (12 ml/kg) had a much delayed and smaller effect on CSNA, less effect on mean arterial pressure, no effect on heart rate, but stimulated RSNA, although the plasma volume expansion was similar. Intracarotid infusion of hypertonic saline (1 ml/min bilaterally, n=5) caused similar changes to intravenous administration, indicating a cerebral component to the effects of hypertonic saline. In further experiments, contractility (maximum change in pressure over time), heart rate, and cardiac output increased significantly more with intravenous hypertonic saline (2 ml/kg) than with Gelofusine (6 ml/kg) after hemorrhage; the effects of hypertonic saline were attenuated by the \u03b2-receptor antagonist propranolol (n=6). These results demonstrate a novel neural mechanism for the effects of hypertonic saline resuscitation, comprising cerebral stimulation of CSNA by sodium chloride to improve cardiac output by increasing cardiac contractility and rate and inhibition of RSNA.", 
    "105": "Our previous studies showed that stimulation of adenosine A(1) receptors located in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) exerts counteracting effects on the iliac vascular bed: activation of the adrenal medulla and \u03b2-adrenergic vasodilation vs. sympathetic and vasopressinergic vasoconstriction. Because NTS A(1) adenosine receptors inhibit baroreflex transmission in the NTS and contribute to the pressor component of the HDR, we hypothesized that these receptors also contribute to the redistribution of blood from the visceral to the muscle vasculature via prevailing sympathetic and vasopressinergic vasoconstriction in the visceral (renal and mesenteric) vascular beds and prevailing \u03b2-adrenergic vasodilation in the somatic (iliac) vasculature. To test this hypothesis, we compared the A(1) adenosine-receptor-mediated effects of each vasoactive factor triggered by NTS A(1) adenosine receptor stimulation [N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), 330 pmol in 50 nl] on the regional vascular responses in urethane/chloralose-anesthetized rats. The single-factor effects were separated using adrenalectomy, \u03b2-adrenergic blockade, V(1) vasopressin receptor blockade, and sinoaortic denervation. In intact animals, initial vasodilation was followed by large, sustained vasoconstriction with smaller responses observed in renal vs. mesenteric and iliac vascular beds. The initial \u03b2-adrenergic vasodilation prevailed in the iliac vs. mesenteric and renal vasculature. The large and sustained vasopressinergic vasoconstriction was similar in all vascular beds. Small sympathetic vasoconstriction was observed only in the iliac vasculature in this setting. We conclude that, although A(1) adenosine-receptor-mediated \u03b2-adrenergic vasodilation may contribute to the redistribution of blood from the visceral to the muscle vasculature, this effect is overridden by sympathetic and vasopressinergic vasoconstriction.",

Here we characterise the cardiovascular changes associated with the intermittent breathing pattern in M. albus and we study the autonomic control of the heart during water- and air-breathing. The shift from water- to air-breathing was associated with a rise in heart rate from 27.7 \u00b1 1.6 to 41.4 \u00b1 2.6 min(-1) and an increase in cardiac output from 23.1 \u00b1 3.0 to 58.7 \u00b1 6.5 mLmin(-1)kg(-1), while mean systemic blood pressure did not change (39.0 \u00b1 3.5 and 46.4 \u00b1 1.3 cmH(2)O). The autonomic control of the heart during water- and air-breathing was revealed by infusion of the \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist propranolol and muscarinic antagonist atropine (3 mgkg(-1)) in eels instrumented with an arterial catheter. Inhibition of the sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations of the heart revealed a strong vagal tone on the heart of water-breathing eels and that the tachycardia during air-breathing is primarily mediated by withdrawal of cholinergic tone.", 
    "107": "The insular cortex (IC) has been reported to be involved in central cardiovascular control. In the present study, we investigated the cardiovascular responses evoked by microinjection of noradrenaline into the IC as well as the central and peripheral mechanisms involved in their mediation. Microinjection of noradrenaline into the IC (3, 7, 10, 15, 30 and 45 nmol/100 nL) caused long-lasting dose-related pressor and bradycardiac responses. The cardiovascular responses evoked by 15 nmol of noradrenaline were blocked by IC pretreatment with WB4101 or 5-methyl-urapidil, selective \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists. IC pretreatment with either the selective \u03b1(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists RX821002 or the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol did not affect noradrenaline cardiovascular responses. Noradrenaline cardiovascular responses were mimicked by microinjection of the selective \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine into the IC, thus reinforcing the idea that \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptors mediate cardiovascular responses to noradrenaline microinjected into the IC. The pressor response to noradrenaline microinjection was potentiated by i.v. pretreatment with the ganglion blocker pentolinium and inhibited by i.v. pretreatment with the selective V(1)-vasopressin receptor antagonist dTyr(CH(2))(5)(Me)AVP. The bradycardiac response to noradrenaline microinjection into the IC was abolished by pretreatment with either pentolinium or the V(1)-vasopressin receptor antagonist, indicating its reflex origin. In conclusion, our results suggest that pressor response evoked by microinjection of noradrenaline into the IC involve the activation of IC \u03b1(1)-adrenoceptors to cause the release of vasopressin into the circulation.",

Using the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor as a case study, this article explores the applicability of docking-based virtual screening to the discovery of GPCR ligands and defines methods intended to improve the screening performance. Our controlled computational experiments were performed on a compound dataset containing known agonists and blockers of the receptor as well as a large number of decoys. The screening based on the structure of the receptor crystallized in complex with its inverse agonist carazolol yielded excellent results, with a clearly delineated prioritization of ligands over decoys. Blockers generally were preferred over agonists; however, agonists were also well distinguished from decoys. A method was devised to increase the screening yields by generating an ensemble of alternative conformations of the receptor that accounts for its flexibility. Moreover, a method was devised to improve the retrieval of agonists, based on the optimization of the receptor around a known agonist. Finally, the applicability of docking-based virtual screening also to homology models endowed with different levels of accuracy was proved. This last point is of uttermost importance, since crystal structures are available only for a limited number of GPCRs, and extends our conclusions to the entire superfamily. The outcome of this analysis definitely supports the application of computer-aided techniques to the discovery of novel GPCR ligands, especially in light of the fact that, in the near future, experimental structures are expected to be solved and become available for an ever increasing number of GPCRs.", 
    "109": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed psychiatric disorder in children. Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) are used as first line treatment. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has a proven role in the expression of ADHD. Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that MPH activates the firing activity of medial PFC neurones in anaesthetised rats. The aim of the present study was to determine the respective contribution and location of the different types of catecholamine receptors in mediating these excitatory effects and to compare these effects with those induced by other selective dopamine or noradrenaline uptake blockers. Single unit activity of presumed pyramidal PFC neurones was recorded in rats anaesthetised with urethane. The activation of firing elicited by an iv administration of MPH (1 or 3mg/kg) was partially reduced or prevented by the selective D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 administered systemically (0.5mg/kg, iv), or locally by passive diffusion through the recording electrode. On the other hand, administration of the alpha 2 receptor antagonist yohimbine (1mg/kg, iv) significantly potentiated the excitatory effect of MPH and activated PFC neurones previously treated with a low inactive dose of MPH (0.3mg/kg, iv). Local administration of MPH (1mM through the recording electrode) significantly increased the firing of PFC neurones in a D1 receptor-dependent manner. In addition, the response of PFC neurones to MPH, administered at a low dose (0.3mg/kg, iv), is greatly potentiated by dopamine (1mM), but not by noradrenaline (1mM), diffusing passively through the recording electrode, and this effect is reversed by D1 receptor blockade. Finally, the selective dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 (6 mg/kg, iv) and desipramine (6 mg/kg, iv) only activate a subset of PFC neurones. These results demonstrate the involvement of cortical dopamine D1 and noradrenergic alpha 2 receptors in the in vivo electrophysiological effects of MPH on PFC neurones.",

The dissolution data showed that the metoprolol contents of Metoprolol Sandoz\u00ae and Seloken ZOC\u00ae were released fast in the presence of 20% ethanol at the investigated conditions, while the other products demonstrated much more stability against ethanol. Unexpectedly it was discovered that the release of metoprolol from Metoprolol GEA\u00ae Retard and to some extent also from Logimax\u00ae forte decreased in the ethanol containing media.",

Reduction in heart rate mediated by this selective I(f) current inhibitor has been associated with anti-ischemic efficacy without any effect on haemodynamic or myocardial contractility. The antianginal efficacy of ivabradine is similar or superior to that of conventional anti-ischemic agents. Moreover combination therapy with ivabradine provides substantial benefit in patients already receiving beta-blocker. Prognostic efficacy of ivabradine is evaluated in a large program of studies, among which BEAUTIFUL in coronary patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The SIGNIFY study is ongoing in stable coronary patients without ventricular dysfunction. Furthermore the SHIFT trial will evaluate ivabradine benefits in heart failure patients, whatever the origin, ischemic or not.",

Rats were divided into two groups according to the diet they received after weaning: (i) the control group (n=16), given a 15% protein diet, and (ii) the malnourished group (n=14), fed a 6% protein diet. Cardiovascular recordings were made and, through selective autonomic blockade, the tonic autonomic balance, cardiac autonomic index and the power spectrum of heart rate (HR) variability were determined. 3. Muscarinic receptor blockade with methylatropine (5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) increased HR in the control group (371 \u00b1 6 vs 427 \u00b1 15 b.p.m. before and after drug administration, respectively), but not the malnourished group (438 \u00b1 24 vs 472 \u00b1 38 b.p.m. before and after drug administration, respectively). Inhibition of \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptors with metoprolol (2.0 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced HR in malnourished rats (428 \u00b1 24 vs 355 \u00b1 16 b.p.m. before and after drug administration, respectively), but had no effect on the HR of the control group (363 \u00b1 8 vs 362 \u00b1 7 b.p.m. before and after drug administration, respectively). Double autonomic blockade by inhibiting both muscarinic cholinoceptors and \u03b2(1)-adrenoceptors reduced HR in the malnourished group (428 \u00b1 24 vs 342 \u00b1 14 b.p.m.) but had no effect on HR in the control group (371 \u00b1 6 vs 382 \u00b1 6 b.p.m.). 4. Sympathetic tone was augmented in malnourished compared with control rats (131 \u00b1 17 vs 41 \u00b1 11 b.p.m., respectively), whereas parasympathetic tone was reduced in malnourished compared with control rats (-4 \u00b1 4 vs 22 \u00b1 9 b.p.m., respectively). 5. The ratio of oscillations in HR induced by sympathetic and parasympathetic activity was higher in malnourished compared with control rats (0.43 \u00b1 0.03 vs 0.34 \u00b1 0.02, respectively). 6. The results of the present study indicate that protein malnutrition after weaning increases sympathetic activity and reduces vagal activity to the heart in rats.

Recent studies have indicated that the sympathetic nervous system plays a role in bone metabolism. This paper reviews findings concerning with sympathetic influences on bone metabolism to hypothesize the mechanism how sympathetic neural functions are related to bone loss in microgravity. Animal studies have suggested that leptin stimulates hypothalamus increasing sympathetic outflow to bone and enhances bone resorption through noradrenaline and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors in bone. In humans, even though there have been some controversial findings, use of \u03b2-adrenoblockers has been reported to be beneficial for prevention of osteoporosis and bone fracture. On the other hand, microneurographically-recorded sympathetic nerve activity was enhanced by exposure to microgravity in space as well as dry immersion or long-term bed rest to simulate microgravity. The same sympathetic activity became higher in elderly people whose bone mass becomes generally reduced. Our recent findings indicated a significant correlation between muscle sympathetic nerve activity and urinary deoxypyridinoline as a specific marker measuring bone resorption. Based on these findings we would like to propose a following hypothesis concerning the sympathetic involvement in the mechanism of bone loss in microgravity: An exposure to prolonged microgravity may enhance sympathetic neural traffic not only to muscle but also to bone. This sympathetic enhancement increases plasma noradrenaline level and inhibits osteogenesis and facilitates bone resorption through \u03b2-adrenoreceptors in bone to facilitate bone resorption to reduce bone mass. The use of \u03b2-adrenoblockers to prevent bone loss in microgravity may be reasonable.",

Many patients on cardiovascular medications will require surgical intervention for conditions often unrelated to their cardiovascular pathology. Cardiologists and anesthesiologists alike must be knowledgeable about the potential interactions between cardiovascular drugs and anesthetics agents or adjuvant therapies administered perioperatively. Current recommendations suggest that beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and alpha2 agonists should be continued throughout the perioperative period, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and diuretics should be discontinued on the morning of surgery and resumed in the immediate postoperative period, unless contraindicated."
