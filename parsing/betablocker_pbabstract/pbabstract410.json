    "0": "To investigate the differences in metabolic response between arm exercise (AE) and leg exercise (LE) and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, seven men were studied during 20 min of AE or LE both with (beta) and without (control, C) nonselective beta-blockade (beta B) (propranolol). The work loads corresponded to 59 and 60% of peak pulmonary O2 uptake (VO2) during LE and AE, respectively. Pulmonary VO2 increased more slowly at the onset of exercise during AEC (half time = 61 +/- 9 s) than during LEC (half time = 35 +/- 3 s) and was not affected by beta B. At the onset of exercise the arteriovenous O2 difference across the exercising limb increased above that of steady state during AEC but not during LEC. This demonstrates that the adjustment of O2 delivery is slower than that of arm VO2 during AE. Despite the smaller exercising muscle mass, the release of lactate and NH3 was about twofold higher during AEC than during LEC. The difference in metabolic response between AE and LE was not altered by beta B. Lactate release was not reduced by beta B but, if anything, tended to increase during both AE and LE (beta vs. C). beta B increased NH3 release during LE (beta vs. C) but not during AE (beta vs. C). We conclude that AE compared with LE at the same relative work load is associated with a greater release of lactate and NH3, indicating a more severe metabolic stress during AE. Furthermore, the present data suggest that the increase in blood lactate at these submaximal exercise intensities is caused by factors other than beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "1": "Modulation of the ventricular action potential by beta-adrenergic activation of Ca2+, K+ and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent Cl- channels was assessed in enzymatically isolated guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. The effectiveness and relative selectivity of 9-anthracene carboxylic acid (9-AC), as an antagonist of cAMP-dependent Cl- channels was also tested. Membrane currents and action potentials were recorded using the conventional whole-cell variant of the patch-clamp technique or with the amphotericin B perforated-patch technique. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol either increased or decreased action potential duration depending on whether the dominant effect was on inward Ca2+ currents or on outward K+ or Cl- currents. When Ca2+ and K+ channel modulation was prevented by nisoldipine and low temperature respectively, beta-adrenergic activation of Cl- channels caused a significant reduction in action potential duration and a slight depolarization of the membrane potential. The beta-adrenergic-mediated effects were reversed by the Cl- channel blocker, 9-AC. In the absence of beta-adrenergic stimulation, 9-AC had no detectable effects on action potentials or Ca2+ currents. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic activation of Cl- channels is a potent mechanism for regulation of action potential duration and that 9-AC may be a useful, relatively specific, pharmacological tool for evaluating the physiological role of cAMP-activated Cl- channels in heart. 9-AC also reversed the ability of isoproterenol to antagonize prolongation of action potential duration by the class III antiarrhythmic agent E-4031.", 
    "2": "Noradrenergic neurotransmission plays an important role in normal immune reactivity. Genetically epilepsy-prone (GEPR-9) rats exhibit deficits in central noradrenergic systems and diminished plaque-forming cell responses following immunization in vivo. In the present study we examined the hypothesis that immunosuppression in GEPR-9 rats is associated with alterations in the splenic noradrenergic system. The content of norepinephrine (NE) in spleens of GEPR-9 age-matched nonepileptic Sprague-Dawley control rats was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). In addition, we measured the number of beta-adrenergic receptors on splenic lymphocyte membranes of GEPR-9 and control rats using the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA). HPLC-EC analysis revealed that splenic norepinephrine content was significantly greater in GEPR-9 rats than in controls. Results from receptor binding studies indicated a 33% reduction in specific binding of [3H]DHA to splenic lymphocyte membranes of GEPR-9 rats. Saturation of binding studies revealed a significant decrease in the maximum number of [3H]DHA binding sites on splenic lymphocyte membranes from GEPR-9 rats. These results indicate that the noradrenergic system in GEPR-9 rat spleen is altered. Whether either or both of these changes contribute to reduced immune reactivity in GEPR-9 rats remains to be determined.", 
    "3": "Glucose-induced shifts in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) were quantitatively and temporally the same in ob/ob and +/+ beta-cells. In both, epinephrine promptly and protractedly inhibited the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i surge via a pertussis toxin-sensitive alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism that was reversible by potassium depolarization. When added before glucose, epinephrine blocked completely in the ob/ob beta-cells, but in the +/+ beta-cells it produced a delayed, reduced, and transient intracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+i) surge. Neither the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker tolbutamide nor the large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel (Kmaxi) blocker charybdotoxin reversed the effect of epinephrine. Tetraethylammonium (TEA), a blocker of both the Kmaxi and the delayed-rectifier K+ channel, and forskolin attenuated the effect of epinephrine in +/+ but not in the ob/ob beta-cells. The data show that 1) alpha 2-adrenoreceptor activation decreases the glucose-stimulated Ca2+i surge in +/+ beta-cells primarily by activating a tolbutamide- and charybdotoxin-insensitive, TEA- and forskolin-sensitive K+ channel; 2) the hypersecretion of insulin in ob/ob beta-cells is not due to enhanced glucose-induced Ca2+ influx; and 3) the ob/ob beta-cells are aberrant with regard to alpha 2-adrenergic modulation.", 
    "4": "1. A double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted on the effects of oral terbutaline (beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist) and propranolol (beta 1 beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist) on basal heat production of skeletal muscle, measured ex vivo by direct microcalorimetry. Terbutaline slow-release 7.5 mg, propranolol 80 mg, and matching placebo were randomly administered twice daily for 1 week to 15 healthy males, using a cross-over design. 2. Resting heat production in biopsied vastus lateralis was lowered by median 27% (P < 0.01) after terbutaline medication as compared with placebo. The cause of this hypometabolism at the cellular level is obscure but may possibly be explained by desensitization of beta 2-receptors. 3. Propranolol decreased the metabolic rate by 17% (P > 0.3); this might imply that the sympathetic nervous system is playing only a minor role in the regulation of basal metabolic rate in muscle, or that up-regulation of beta-receptors had influenced the decline. 4. The muscle utilized about 6% of its total energy for the Na-K pump as assessed after inhibition by ouabain. 5. Serum potassium was significantly lowered by terbutaline and slightly increased by propranolol with no relationship between changes in extracellular levels and muscle content of potassium under resting conditions. Energy values for the Na-K pump in muscle after 1 week of terbutaline or propranolol medication were similar to placebo. The results are not consistent with the hypothesis that decreased serum potassium during continuous beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist treatment is due to a chronically activated Na-K pump, at least not in resting muscle.", 
    "5": "It was recently reported that acute cocaine pretreatment can reduce the (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI)-induced 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2)-receptor mediated head-twitch response (HTR) in mice via indirect stimulation of adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A-receptors. The aim of the present investigation was to determine whether cocaine can alter the DOI-induced HTR in 5-HT2-receptor supersensitive mice. Supersensitivity was induced by a single injection of DOI 48 h prior to experimentation. These supersensitive mice exhibited a greater frequency of HTR to a challenge dose of DOI 48 h after its initial administration. Cocaine pretreatment dose-dependently reduced the DOI-induced HTR in the supersensitive mice. The stimulant was approximately four times more potent in the 5-HT2-receptor supersensitive mice relative to its reported effects in normal mice. Receptor blockade studies with yohimbine and alprenolol revealed that both of the inhibitory components of cocaine's actions (i.e., adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A-receptor effects, respectively) were more efficient in reducing the DOI-induced HTR in supersensitive mice compared to normosensitive animals. The present results further support the previously suggested hypothesis that acute cocaine administration inhibits the 5-HT2-receptor function by increasing the synaptic concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin via inhibition of their uptake and therefore indirectly stimulating the respective inhibitory adrenergic alpha 2- and serotonergic 5-HT1A-receptors.", 
    "6": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has a stimulatory effect on adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release. In the present study, to investigate the effect of NPY on CRF synthesis, the effect of centrally administered NPY on CRF messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in rat hypothalamus was examined under pentobarbital anesthesia. The administration of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 nmol of NPY into the lateral ventricle dose-dependently Increased the plasma ACTH levels, as well as the levels of proopiomelanocortin mRNA in the anterior pituitary. The CRF mRNA level in the hypothalamus also increased after administration of 0.1 and 1 nmol of NPY in a dose-dependent manner. The administration of 3 nmol of phentolamine or propranolol failed to block 0.1 nmol NPY-induced ACTH release or 1 nmol NPY-stimulated CRF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus. These results Indicate that the central administration of NPY increases the CRF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and the probable CRF release, which increases the proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels and ACTH secretion in the anterior pituitary. Therefore, NPY seems to play a physiological role in the regulation of the release and synthesis of CRF in the hypothalamus.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether a chronic prenatal beta-blockade can alter the maturation of the noradrenergic system in the rat brain. Pregnant female and adult male rats were treated for 10 days with the beta-antagonist propranolol dissolved in the drinking water (40-50 mg/kg/day). Direct and long-term effects on beta-adrenoceptors and monoamine metabolism in various rat brain regions were determined. After the prenatal treatment the propranolol level in the foetal brain was 0.9 micrograms/g, while in the adult brain 2.0 micrograms/g was present. The foetal beta 1-receptors were significantly up-regulated by propranolol (200%), whereas the beta 2-receptor number remained unaltered. On postnatal days 4 and 21 the number of both beta-subtypes was the same as that of controls. Noradrenaline, its metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and their ratio were unaltered directly after the prenatal treatment. In the PN 21 offspring, however, the metabolite level had increased in the frontal cortex (+ 17%) and hippocampus (+ 32%), and the ratio in the hippocampus (37%) and medulla pons (+ 34%). Prenatal treatment also induced a significant increase of the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.5-hydroxytryptamine ratio (+ 15%) in the medulla pons at GD 21. No direct or lasting effects were found on dopamine metabolism. Propranolol treatment of adult rats gave no direct changes in monoamine metabolism. We concluded that chronic prenatal propranolol exposure (a) reversibly up-regulates foetal beta 1-adrenoceptors, and (b) increases the NA activity in the brain in later life.", 
    "8": "The present study assessed the involvement of the beta adrenergic system in the immunomodulatory effects of morphine. Male Lewis rats were administered either the nonselective beta adrenergic antagonist nadolol, the beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist atenolol or the beta 2-selective adrenergic antagonist erythro-dl-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)-3-isopropylaminobuta n-2-ol (ICI-118,551) in doses of 0, 0.125, 0.5, 2.0 or 8.0 mg/kg s.c. before the administration of 15 mg/kg morphine or saline s.c. After sacrifice, the spleen was removed and blood was collected from each rat and multiple in vitro immune assays were performed. Pretreatment with all three beta adrenergic antagonists completely antagonized the suppressive effects of morphine on the proliferative responses of splenic leukocytes to concanavalin-A (Con-A), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the combination of ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). None of the antagonists blocked the suppressive effects of morphine on the proliferative responses of blood leukocytes to concanavalin-A or phytohemagglutinin, splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity, total splenic leukocyte counts and blood leukocyte counts per milliliter. These results demonstrate the involvement of beta adrenergic receptors in certain of morphine's immunosuppressive effects. Moreover, because both nadolol and atenolol are peripherally acting compounds, these data implicate peripheral beta adrenergic receptors specifically in morphine's immunomodulatory effects.", 
    "9": "A \"caged\" analogue of the alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine (PE) was prepared by exploiting the 2-nitrobenzyl protecting group and using a synthetic procedure developed to permit preferential derivatization at the amino group. On isolated adult rat mesenteric arterioles, caged-PE had no measurable effects at concentrations up to 100 microM; 0.5-ms light flashes in the presence of caged-PE, however, produced marked and dose-dependent vasoconstriction. Flash-induced vasoconstrictions were blocked by the alpha-receptor antagonist phentolamine and were unaffected by the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, indicating that the light-induced responses reflect the selective activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. After a single flash, a large transient decrease in vessel diameter was recorded, and in most vessels, this was followed by a smaller, sustained constriction. The sustained component of the contraction was selectively eliminated when Ca2+ was removed from the bath, which suggests that different mechanisms underlie the transient and the sustained responses to PE. The responses to single flashes of varying intensities occurred with a mean latency of 460 ms, which is consistent with the intermediacy of several steps between alpha-receptor activation and contraction. We anticipate that it will be possible to extend this approach to develop caged analogues of other neurotransmitters for mechanistic and kinetic studies.",

    "11": "Data were obtained from a study of 15 men with moderate to severe essential hypertension who had been treated with a placebo followed by 6-8 months of carvedilol monotherapy (25-75 mg/day). Blood pressure was evaluated by 24-h ambulatory monitoring.", 
    "12": "In studies of office or 'white-coat' hypertensives, ambulatory blood pressure has proved a better predictor of target organ involvement than casual (clinic) pressure. Blood pressure loads of > 50% for systolic pressure and > 40% for diastolic pressure are superior to clinic pressures, and also to the usual ambulatory monitoring parameters of mean 24-h, awake and sleeping blood pressure, in predicting left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormal diastolic performance. In the carvedilol study, the mean awake systolic blood pressure load fell from 94 to 43% and the diastolic blood pressure load fell from 84 to 27% with carvedilol treatment (P < 0.001 in both cases). Of the patients treated with carvedilol monotherapy, 60% fell into the lower risk category (< 50% systolic blood pressure and < 40% diastolic blood pressure load).",

    "14": "A series of 5-deoxy-5-(4-substituted piperazin-1-yl)-1,4: 3,6-dianhydro-L-iditol 2-nitrates was prepared and evaluated for oral anti-ischemic activities. Inhibition of lysine-vasopressin-induced T-wave elevation in the electrocardiogram (ECG) of rats (angina pectoris model) served as a primary assay. Optimum activity was observed for the compounds with the aryl-heteroatom (O,S, or N)-propyl group. Among them, the phenylthiopropyl-substituted compound 13 exhibited the most potent activity. Furthermore, intraduodenal administration (i.d.) of 13 tended to decrease left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in a propranolol-induced heart failure model (dogs) and showed a potent protective effect against reperfusion arrhythmia in rats. Thus, 13 (KF 14124) is under further study as an orally active nitrate.", 
    "15": "A randomized study was performed on 70 patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery to examine whether the combined, perioperative, 24-hour infusion of the calcium-channel blocker nifedipine (10 micrograms/kg/h) and the beta 1-blocker metoprolol (12 micrograms/kg/h) reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and arrhythmias (group NM, n = 34). The control group received nifedipine only (n = 36). Repeated assessment of serum enzyme levels (CK, CK-MB) and 12-lead ECG, together with 3-channel Holter monitoring over 48 h were used to define perioperative myocardial ischemia (transient ischemic event, myocardial infarction) and supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The two groups did not significantly differ with respect to preoperative anamnestic and surgical data. No perioperative myocardial infarction was detected in either group. However, a significantly lower incidence of transient ischemic events was observed in the NM group as compared to the nifedipine group (3% versus 11%; p < 0.05). In addition, there was a tendency towards lower CK-MB levels and peak-values of CK- and CK-MB in the NM group. With regard to perioperative dysrhythmias, there was a significantly lower incidence of sinus tachycardia (9%) and atrial flutter/fibrillation (6%) in the NM group as compared to the nifedipine group (33 and 27%, p < 0.05). In addition, postoperative heart rate was lower in the NM group starting from the 6th hour after opening of the aortic cross-clamp. In conclusion, the combined perioperative infusion of nifedipine and metoprolol is superior in preventing perioperative myocardial ischemia and decreasing the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmias as compared to a single-drug regimen with nifedipine.", 
    "16": "Initially synthesized in 1960, sotalol is a novel beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent that also possesses class III anti-arrhythmic properties. The drug's ability to lengthen repolarization and prolong effective refractory periods in all cardiac tissues in addition to its beta-blocking effects make sotalol an attractive agent for use in a variety of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "17": "The activity of imipramine 2-hydroxylase highly correlated with that of desipramine 2-hydroxylase but not with that of desipramine N-demethylase. The correlation was also found between N-demethylation and 2-hydroxylation when imipramine was used as a substrate, whereas no correlation was observed between them when desipramine was used in place of imipramine. Both activities of desipramine and imipramine 2-hydroxylase were markedly inhibited by quinidine but not by quinine. Although the activity of imipramine N-demethylase was slightly inhibited by both quinidine and quinine, the activity of desipramine N-demethylase was unaffected under the same conditions. The activity of imipramine N-demethylase was roughly correlated with the amounts of P450 3A4 immunochemically determined and the activities of testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase in human liver microsomes. The P450 3A4 catalyzed imipramine N-demethylation much more efficiently than 2-hydroxylation in a reconstituted system, whereas neither N-demethylation nor 2-hydroxylation of desipramine was catalyzed by P450 3A4. The activity of imipramine N-demethylase was inhibited, to various extents, by anti-P450 3A4 antibodies in human liver microsomes. Taking together these and other results, it is suggested that P450 3A4, other than P450 2Cmp, also partly contributes to N-demethylation of imipramine, depending on human liver microsomes.", 
    "18": "The hemodynamic and myocardial metabolic effects of enoximone (phosphodiesterase III inhibitor), alone or in combination with metoprolol (beta-adrenergic blocker), were studied in patients with congestive heart failure. Ten patients (New York Heart Association Class III-IV) underwent right heart and coronary sinus catheterization, and parameters were assessed at basal condition, at peak enoximone response (mean intravenous loading dose = 2.2 mg/kg), and after the combination with metoprolol (mean intravenous dose = 8.5 mg). Heart rate tended to increase during enoximone administration (from 102 +/- 16 to 107 +/- 16 min-1, ns) and was reduced during enoximone plus metoprolol (to 88 +/- 15 min-1, p < 0.05 vs. basal). Cardiac index was increased during enoximone (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 1/min/m2, p < 0.05) and decreased during enoximone plus metoprolol (to 2.8 +/- 0.5 1/min/m2, p < 0.05 vs. enoximone). Mean pulmonary wedge pressure fell during enoximone and remained reduced during enoximone plus metoprolol (from 27 +/- 9 to 9 +/- 3 and to 13 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively, both p < 0.05). Myocardial oxygen consumption did not change during enoximone (from 27 +/- 8 to 25 +/- 13 ml/min, ns) and was reduced during enoximone plus metoprolol (to 19 +/- 8 ml/min, p < 0.05 vs. basal). Myocardial lactate extraction tended to be lower during enoximone and during enoximone plus metoprolol conditions (from 38 +/- 17% to 26 +/- 20% and to 29 +/- 24%, respectively), but no statistical significance was found. Myocardial efficiency was increased during enoximone and during enoximone plus metoprolol (from 9 +/- 3% to 15 +/- 6% and to 14 +/- 6%, respectively, both p < 0.05). Thus in patients with congestive heart failure enoximone improves hemodynamics and, in most cases, it does not influence energetics. The addition of metoprolol to enoximone reduces heart rate, cardiac index, and myocardial oxygen consumption without any other major changes, producing a more physiologic hemodynamic and metabolic profile.", 
    "19": "The regional distribution and the pharmacology of the binding sites labelled with the novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 5-HT1B/1D selective radioligand serotonin-O-carboxy-methyl-glycyl-[125I]tyrosinamide (abbreviated [125I]GTI for the sake of simplicity) was determined using quantitative autoradiography in rat brain. The distribution of [125I]GTI binding sites was largely comparable to that of [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I] ICYP) which labels 5-HT1B binding sites (in the presence of 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-[2N-dipropylamino]tetralin) and isoprenaline, to prevent binding to 5-HT1A and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites), although a detailed analysis revealed differences. The pharmacology of the [125I]GTI binding sites was analysed using compounds known to display high affinity for and/or distinguish between 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D sites: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), sumatriptan, CP 93129 (5-hydroxy-3(4-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl)-4-azaindole), (-)pindolol, PAPP (4[2-[4-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1- piperazinyl]ethyl]benzeneamine), rauwolscine, and 8-OH-DPAT. The displacement of [125I]GTI by 5-CT was monophasic. By contrast, the selective 5-HT1B compound CP 93129 and (-)pindolol produced biphasic curves showing a majority of high affinity sites in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra, whereas PAPP and sumatriptan (which are somewhat 5-HT1D selective) produced biphasic curves indicating a minority of high affinity sites in these areas. In addition, by blocking the 5-HT1B sites with 100 nM CP 93129, the remaining population of [125I]GTI binding sites could be studied and was found to have high affinity for PAPP, rauwolscine and 8-OH-DPAT. The pharmacological profile of the major binding component was typical of the 5-HT1B type: 5-CT > CP 93129 > or = (-)pindolol > sumatriptan > or = PAPP > rauwolscine. The profile of the minor component of [125I]GTI binding is best characterised as that of a 5-HT1D site: 5-CT > PAPP > or = sumatriptan > rauwolscine > (-)pindolol > or = CP 93129. The localisation of the non 5-HT1B [125I]GTI binding sites was characterised by blocking the 5-HT1B receptors with 100 nM CP 93129. Low densities of the 5-HT1D recognition sites were found to be present in globus pallidus, ventral pallidum, caudate-putamen, subthalamic nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus, substantia nigra (reticular part), nuclei of the (normal and accessory) optic tract, different nuclei of the geniculate body and frontoparietal cortex, although higher densities of 5-HT1B sites were always observed in the same structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "20": "1. The effect of prolonged application of isoprenaline on intracellular free-Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) was examined by use of 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-n.m.r.) in rat isolated hearts. Left ventricular pressure (LVP) was simultaneously measured. 2. [Mg2+]i was estimated from the separation of the alpha- and beta-ATP peaks, using the dissociation constant of MgATP 38 microM (established previously). In normal (phosphate-free, Krebs-Henseleit) solution, [Mg2+]i was approximately 0.4 mM. 3. When isoprenaline was applied for 100 min, a transient increase in [Mg2+]i was observed during the initial 25 min, whilst concentrations of ATP ([ATP]) and phosphocreatine ([PCr]) decreased and [Pi] correspondingly increased. During the subsequent 75 min of isoprenaline application, [Mg2+]i decreased below its resting levels. Washout of isoprenaline restored [Mg2+]i and [PCr], but [ATP] remained low. These changes elicited by isoprenaline were not observed in the presence of propranolol, a typical alpha-adrenoceptor blocker. 4. Isoprenaline increased both LVP and heart rate. The increased LVP and heart rate slowly returned to lower values during prolonged application of isoprenaline, but remained higher than those before application. 5. The transient rise in [Mg2+]i elicited by isoprenaline could be attributed to the decrease in [ATP] resulting in a release of Mg2+. The subsequent decrease in [Mg2+]i during the prolonged applications suggests that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation itself facilitates Mg(2+)-extruding mechanism(s).", 
    "21": "The radiotelemetry system described in this paper consists of an implantable transmitter and a receiver, connected to a microcomputer. The hardware and software belonging to Mini-Mitters, for the collection and analysis of heart rate (HR), core temperature (CT), and gross activity data, do not possess the flexibility to detect acute changes in HR nor to discriminate among simultaneously occurring different types of behavior. In order to study short-term changes in HR in response to stress or drugs, in relation to behavioral responses, an inexpensive computer interface and a software program (CARDIAQ) were developed to collect data from Mini-Mitters. The interface conveys the QRS signal, which is converted to a TTL pulse train, to the parallel printer adapter (LPT1) of an IBM-compatible computer. Heart rate is determined by measuring single interbeat intervals (IBI). The software controls the sampling schedule and stores the collected data in a format compatible with a commercial spreadsheet package. The program calculates the median IBI per s, mean +/- SD IBI, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the IBI distribution. In addition, it enables simultaneous recording of behavior by entering data through the keyboard at the occurrence of each event. In this paper, we describe the CARDIAQ program and provide examples of its application together with the implantable transmitters in freely moving rats.", 
    "22": "Combined treatment with propranolol and reserpine enhanced acetylcholine-induced dose-response curves for bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs in vivo. This airway hyperreactivity model was investigated pharmacologically. (1) Increased capillary permeability and increases in leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were not observed after this combined treatment. (2) The increased airway sensitivity to acetylcholine produced by propranolol and reserpine was inhibited by ketotifen and theophylline, reported in clinical studies to inhibit airway hyperreactivity. (3) Two leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonists, MCI-826 and FPL-55712, clearly inhibited this increased airway reactivity. (4) A thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonist, ONO-3708, and TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, OKY-046, also inhibited this increased airway reactivity. These results suggest that the airway hyperreactivity model produced by propranolol and reserpine in guinea pigs is a valuable pharmacological tool for investigating a remedy and LT and TXA2 may be involved in the onset of this airway hyperreactivity.", 
    "23": "The relationships between pressure rate product (PRP) and flux (PCr-->ATP) or flux (Pi-->ATP) were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts by the saturation transfer method using 31P-NMR. The effects of propranolol and diltiazem on phosphate metabolism were also studied. After a 40 min preischemic period, the hearts were subjected to a 15 min period of ischemia, followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Propranolol (0.4-1.2 microM) or diltiazem (3.0-6.0 microM) was infused for 30 min before ischemia and reinfused after reperfusion for 60 min. The flux (PCr-->ATP)/PRP ratio at reperfusion did not differ from that at preischemia. This value was also not affected by propranolol or diltiazem treatment. However, the flux (Pi-->ATP)/PRP ratio at reperfusion was significantly less than that at preischemia. Moreover, this value was significantly improved by propranolol or diltiazem treatment. This study demonstrates that 1) flux (PCr-->ATP) has a good correlation with cardiac performance, 2) stunned myocardium needs less ATP turnover for survival of its depressed contractile activity, and 3) flux (Pi-->ATP) can limit recovery of postischemic performance. Protective effects of propranolol and diltiazem are exerted on the flux (Pi-->ATP), i.e. ATP derived from glycolytic flux, in the reperfused heart.", 
    "24": "The effects of a single oral dose of indomethacin (1 mg kg-1) metoprolol (1.5 mg kg-1) and placebo on exercise-induced albumin excretion rate (AER) were compared in a randomized, crossover design in 14 normotensive, young Type 1 diabetes patients, nine of them with microalbuminuria (AER > 15 micrograms min-1) and five without microalbuminuria at rest. The albumin excretion rate, blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, and plasma concentrations of indomethacin and metoprolol were determined before and after 30 min submaximal physical exercise. In microalbuminuric patients the rise in albumin excretion rate after exercise on indomethacin (7 micrograms min-1) was lower than after placebo (29 micrograms min-1, p < 0.001) whereas the rise in albumin excretion rate with metoprolol during exercise (18 micrograms min-1) did not differ from placebo (p = 0.48), in spite of the expected less marked increase in blood pressure. In normoalbuminuric patients no significant increase in albumin excretion rate was noted by exercise in any of the treatment periods. A tendency to a linear correlation (r = -0.54, p = 0.07) was seen between the plasma concentration of indomethacin and the inhibition of exercise-induced increase in albumin excretion rate. No correlations were observed between exercise-induced changes in albumin excretion rate and systolic blood pressure, heart rate or blood glucose. In conclusion, acute indomethacin treatment, presumably through inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis, reduces the exercise-induced rise in albumin excretion rate in Type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The cell bodies of the lingual branch of the trigeminal nerve were localized in the trigeminal ganglion using extracellular recordings together with horseradish peroxidase labeling from the tongue. Individual lingual nerve fibers were characterized with regard to their conduction velocities, receptive fields, and response to thermal, mechanical, and chemical stimuli. Fibers were classified as C, A delta, A beta, cold, and warm. The chemical stimuli included NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, CaCl2, menthol, nicotine, hexanol, and capsaicin. With increasing salt concentration the latency of the response decreased and the activity increased. The responses elicited by salts (to 2.5 M), but not nonpolar stimuli such as menthol, were reversibly inhibited by 3.5 mM of the tight junction blocker, LaCl3. These data suggest that salts diffuse into stratified squamous epithelia through tight junctions in the stratum corneum and stratum granulosum, whereupon they enter the extracellular space. 11 C fibers were identified and 5 were characterized as polymodal nociceptors. All of the C fibers were activated by one or more of the salts NaCl, KCl, or NH4Cl. Three C fibers were activated by nicotine (1 mM), but none were affected by CaCl2 (1 M), menthol (1 mM), or hexanol (50 mM). However, not all C fibers or even the subpopulation of polymodals were activated by the same salts or by nicotine. Thus, it appears that C fibers display differential responsiveness to chemical stimuli. A delta fibers also showed differential sensitivity to chemicals. Of the 35 characterized A delta mechanoreceptors, 8 responded to NaCl, 9 to KCl, 9 to NH4Cl, 0 to CaCl2, menthol, or hexanol, and 2 to nicotine. 8 of 9 of the cold fibers (characterized as A delta's) responded to menthol, none responded to nicotine, 8 of 16 were inhibited by hexanol, 9 of 19 responded to 2.5 M NH4Cl, 5 of 19 responded to 2.5 M KCl, and 1 of 19 responded to 2.5 M NaCl. In summary, lingual nerve fibers exhibit responsiveness to chemicals introduced onto the tongue. The differential responses of these fibers are potentially capable of transmitting information regarding the quality and quantity of chemical stimuli from the tongue to the central nervous system.",

Its effects after 1 month's administration on heart rate, blood pressure and muscle blood flow were studied in a double-blind crossover comparison with nifedipine in 16 hypertensive patients. 2. Dilevalol and nifedipine were similarly effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest, but dilevalol limited the rise in systolic blood pressure induced by exercise more than nifedipine (rise of 27 vs 53 mm Hg respectively, P < 0.01). 3. Dilevalol decreased resting heart rate compared with nifedipine (73 vs 92 beats min-1 respectively, P < 0.01). Dilevalol limited the exercise induced rise in heart rate more than nifedipine (36 vs 48 beats min-1 respectively, P < 0.01). 4. Muscle blood flow (measured by strain gauge plethysmography) was not affected by either dilevalol or nifedipine at rest. After exercise, dilevalol caused an increase in excess blood flow compared with placebo (10.8 vs 5.1 ml min-1 dl-1 respectively, P < 0.01). The difference between dilevalol and nifedipine did not reach statistical significance (10.8 vs 6.5 ml min-1 dl-1 respectively, P > 0.05). 5. On blood pressure and heart rate, dilevalol demonstrated beta-adrenoceptor blocker activity at rest and on exercise. On muscle blood flow, dilevalol appeared to have no effect at rest, but may have acted as a beta-adrenoceptor blocker rather than as a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist during exercise.",

The precise mechanism by which d-sotalol terminates this arrhythmia is not known.", 
    "28": "In the present study, right atrial (RA) activation sequences in the isolated, coronary artery perfused canine heart during episodes of sustained flutter (n = 7) and drug administration were determined. A fixed array of bipolar electrodes was used to record endocardial electrograms from 96 sites on the RA simultaneously. Maps of all control flutters showed that the rhythm was due to persistent circus movement of the impulse around the tricuspid valve ring. D-sotalol was effective in terminating atrial reentry in this model. In all episodes, block of the excitatory impulse in a specific region of the reentrant circuit accompanied these terminations. However, the events preceding the occurrence of block of the impulse were not similar. Two different modes of termination are described.", 
    "29": "The Class III antiarrhythmic agent d-sotalol can terminate atrial reentry in several ways. In one mode, complete conduction block of the reentering impulse within the fixed path occurs to terminate the rhythm. In the other mode, interruption of the original reentrant circuit occurs when there is failure of a lateral boundary. Often in this latter case, interruption of the original circuit is by an extra impulse that is secondary to a change in the path of the impulse. In both modes cycle length oscillations are observed.",

The effects of chronic administration (28 days s.c. via Alzet osmotic minipumps) of 2-phenylethylamine.HCl (10 mg kg-1 per day) and/or (-)-deprenyl.HCl (1 mg kg-1 per day) on dopamine and noradrenaline receptor subtypes have been measured in rat brain. 3H-CGP 12177 was used to label beta-adrenoceptors; 3H-spiperone and 3H-SCH 23390 were used to label D2-like and D1-like receptors. 2. Total cortical beta-adrenoceptor density was reduced by (-)-deprenyl but not 2-phenylethylamine alone. Combined administration of 2-phenylethylamine and (-)-deprenyl resulted in a significantly larger decrease than (-)-deprenyl alone. Subtype density analysis by competition experiments with ICI 89406 revealed that the (-)-deprenyl effect in cortex was due to a decrease in beta 1-adrenoceptor density. The combination of 2-phenylethylamine and (-)-deprenyl resulted in a significant decrease in both cortical beta 1- and cortical beta 2-adrenoceptors. Cerebellar beta-adrenoceptor density was not altered by the present drug treatments. The Kd values for total beta-adrenoceptor densities and Ki values for beta-adrenoceptor subtype densities were not altered by drug treatment in either cortex or cerebellum. 3. Administration of 2-phenylethylamine and of (-)-deprenyl resulted in a decrease in the density of D1-like 3H-SCH 23390 but not D2-like 3H-spiperone binding to dopamine receptors in the striatum. The effects of combined 2-phenylethylamine and (-)-deprenyl treatment on 3H-SCH 23390 binding were additive. These drug treatments did not alter Kd values for these binding sites. 4. The down-regulation of catecholamine receptors following chronically increased availability of 2-phenylethylamine may be due to the catecholamine releasing or uptake blocking effects of this amine. These effects may also be attributable to a direct neuromodulatory action of 2-phenylethylamine on catecholamine receptors. 5. The parallels between effects of increased 2-phenylethylamine availability and effects of administration of MAO inhibitor antidepressants on catecholamine receptor systems indicate that this substrate for MAO may mediate some of the effects of MAO inhibitor antidepressants.", 
    "31": "Experiments were performed on 99 Wistar rats. It was found that hyperviscosity and elevation of blood pressure (BP) could be induced by hanging and restraining conscious rats with their four limbs tied on a frame. These effects were unaffected by bilateral vagotomy. By intravenous injection of propranolol or phentolamine, elevation of BP could be reduced, while stress-induced hyperviscosity could only be reduced by propranolol (i.v.). Stress-induced hyperviscosity and elevation of BP could be inhibited by electroacupuncture applied to the right hind leg or microinjection of morphine into 4th ventricle of the brain. On the other hand, if opiate receptor antagonist naloxone was given into the 4th-ventricle, the stress-induced hyperviscosity and elevation of BP could no longer be inhibited by electroacupuncture. It is suggested that the hyperviscosity and elevation of BP induced by hanging and restraining are mediated by excitatory cardiovascular sympathetic outflow with the result of activation of adrenoreceptors. Activation of the opiate receptors in the hindbrain may be responsible for decrease in stress-induced hyperviscosity and elevation of BP and for the inhibitory effect of electroacupuncture of the right hind leg on stress-induced hyperviscosity and elevation of BP.", 
    "32": "1. We previously demonstrated that a central injection of interferon-alpha in rats induced a suppression of cytotoxicity of splenic natural killer cells which depended upon intact splenic sympathetic innervation, suggesting the important role of the splenic nerve in immunosuppression. To further study the mechanisms of this phenomenon, we investigated: (1) the effects of a central injection of recombinant human interferon-alpha on the electrical activity of the splenic nerve, and (2) the responses of splenic natural killer cytotoxicity on the electrical stimulation of the splenic nerve in urethane with alpha-chloralose anaesthetized rats. 2. An injection of recombinant human interferon-alpha (1.5 x 10(3) and 6.0 x 10(3) units (u) per rat) into the third cerebral ventricle produced a sustained and long lasting (at least for more than 60 min) increase in the electrical activity of splenic sympathetic nerve filaments in a dose-dependent manner. Following an intra-third-ventricular injection of recombinant human interferon-alpha at a dose of 6.0 x 10(3) u, the efferent discharges were elevated 2-6 times that of the pre-injection level with a mean onset latency of 12 min (8-16 min). No changes in the arterial blood pressure and body temperature were observed after injections of recombinant human interferon-alpha. 3. The excitation of the nerve activity induced by intra-ventricular recombinant human interferon-alpha was reversibly suppressed by an intravenous injection of an opioid antagonist, naloxone (1 mg/kg in 0.1 ml saline), whereas the injection of naloxone alone did not affect either the baseline level of the nerve activity or the systemic blood pressure. 4. The cytotoxicity of natural killer cells in the spleen measured by a standard chromium release assay was reduced 20 min after the laparotomy alone in anaesthetized rats. The reduced natural killer activity then recovered significantly when the splenic nerve was cut immediately after the laparotomy. When the peripheral cut end of the splenic nerve was subsequently stimulated (0.5 mA, 0.5 ms, 20 Hz for 20 min), a further suppression of natural killer cytotoxicity was observed. 5. The reduction of natural killer cytotoxicity produced by the stimulation of the splenic nerve was completely blocked by an intravenous injection of nadolol (a peripherally acting beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist), but not by that of prazosin (an alpha-antagonist). 6. These results indicate that a central injection of recombinant human interferon-alpha activates the splenic sympathetic nerve through brain opioid receptors and thereby suppresses the natural killer cytotoxicity by beta-adrenergic mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

A lower dose of 0.05 microgram/g was without any effect on these enzyme activities. A uniform increase in the Mg(2+)-ATPase activity was observed after injections with 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 micrograms/g of E2. Ergosterol, a nonsex steroid did not show any change in the malate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities on which this compound was tested at a 2.0 micrograms/g dose, compared to the control values. Simultaneous injection of tamoxifen (0.5 microgram/g), an antiestrogenic compound, with E2 (2 micrograms/g) caused inhibition of the E2-induced rise in mitochondrial Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and cytosolic NADP-linked malate dehydrogenase activities. Conversely, tamoxifen (0.5 and 1.0 microgram/g) behaved as an estrogen agonist to the response (increase) of Mg(2+)-ATPase and cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities. Potentiation of the estrogen effect with tamoxifen (1.0 microgram/g) was observed in these enzyme activities when used simultaneously with E2 (2 micrograms/g). Use of cycloheximide (0.5 mg/liter), a protein synthesis blocker, inhibited the inhibited the E2 (2 micrograms/g)-induced increase in all the enzyme activities studied. The data show specific and prominent subcellular action of estrogen with an indication of its role in energy-dependent ion transport and metabolic activation in hepatopancreas of the freshwater prawn.",

As left ventricular systolic pressure steadily rose with angiotensin infusion from 87(7) to 124(13) to 152(10) mm Hg (p < 0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction decreased markedly from 45(4) to 35(4) to 27(4)% (p < 0.001). Left ventricular +dP/dtmax did not change [1537(100) to 1500(110) to 1498(84) mm Hg.s-1] in spite of a significant increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure from 16(2) to 21(5) to 29(7) mm Hg (p < 0.001) and left ventricular end diastolic volume from 59(12) to 71(14) to 78(17) ml (p < 0.001).

However, left ventricular systolic function showed limited contractile reserve when challenged by physiological increases in systemic arterial pressure.

The electrical properties of cultured myocytes and neurones were investigated by means of a conventional microelectrode technique and the spontaneous contractile activity of the myocytes was recorded by a video system. The electrical, contractile, and pharmacological properties of myocyte-neuronal networks were investigated by superfusing the cultures with various neuromodulators and blockers.",

Innervated and non-innervated cardiomyocyte cultures responded differently, however, to various pharmacological interventions. Spontaneous contractions were attenuated by tetrodotoxin (4 x 10(-7) M), beta adrenergic blockade, and nicotinic blockade more in cocultures than in cardiac myocyte cultures alone. On the other hand, the beta agonist isoproterenol increased the spontaneous beating in both types of cocultures more than in myocytes alone. The effects of the muscarinic agonist bethanechol and the muscarinic blocker atropine were not significantly different in innervated and non-innervated cultures. Nicotine induced either an increase or decrease in contractile rates of both cocultures and did not affect non-innervated myocyte cultures.",

The results suggest that functional contacts can be established between adult myocytes and dissociated neurones in primary cultures.

Forty patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg were two weeks after discontinuation of treatment divided at random into two groups treated with 50 mg atenolol and 5 mg bisoprolol. If the blood pressure was not affected by this dosage, the dose was raised to 100 mg atenolol and 10 mg bisoprolol. The blood pressure readings, heart rate, side effects of the drugs, laboratory and echocardiographic values were followed up for a period of three months. The authors recorded a marked decline of pressure and heart rate after the first week of therapy, the pressure readings in an upright position did not differ statistically from values in a sitting position, orthostatic hypotension was not recorded. The rate of success of bisoprolol was 85%, of atenolol 75%. During treatment no serious side-effects were observed. The biochemical parameters and echocardiographic values were not altered significantly by treatment. Atenolol and bisoprolol are two effective beta-1-selective blockers with a comparable effect in the treatment of mild and medium severe hypertension. They are useful in monotherapy as well as in combination with other antihypertensive drugs. In hypertension associated with diabetes mellitus, incipient bronchopulmonary disease and pregnancy they are also indicated. They are well tolerated also by elderly patients, an advantage of bisoprolol may be that it has a smaller impact on pressure and heart rate during the night.",

LDL peak Sf was significantly lower in both NSEL (P < 0.005) and SEL (P < 0.02) compared to NoBB. Despite the lack of differences in levels of LDL-cholesterol, beta-blocker use is associated with a significant difference in the distribution of larger, more buoyant to smaller, more dense LDL particles.

A reduction in blood pressure has also been shown to reduce the risk of strokes. In addition to other classical risk factors, such as abnormal serum lipids, diabetes and a genetic predisposition, recent studies have shown that elevated levels of fibrinogen and other clotting factors, elevated levels of renin and decreased levels of anti-oxidant vitamins such as E, C and beta-carotene can predict coronary heart disease and strokes. Thrombolytic therapy, aspirin and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction, and the latter two agents reduce mortality, re-infarction and strokes with long-term use. Treatment with intravenous magnesium and nitrates has shown promise but larger trials are required to confirm the results. Both aspirin and heparin have proven value in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction and death in unstable angina. Following an acute myocardial infarction, long-term therapy with aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering agents and oral anticoagulants has been shown to reduce mortality and re-infarction. In patients with large infarcts associated with a low ejection fraction or heart failure, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces mortality, hospitalization for heart failure and re-infarction. The use of diuretics to lower blood pressure reduces strokes. In contrast, calcium antagonists do not appear to consistently reduce mortality or prevent vascular events when used for primary or secondary prevention of either myocardial infarction or strokes.",

However, adverse effects include increased peripheral resistance, limitation of exercise tolerance, and bradyarrhythmia, cold extremities and bronchoconstriction in susceptible patients. Effects of beta 1-selective blockers: beta 1-Selective antagonists cause less vasoconstriction and less bronchoconstriction than non-selective beta-blockers, but the reduction in cardiac output may still activate a sympathetically mediated increase in peripheral resistance. beta 1-blockers with beta 2 agonist activity are vasodilatory because they activate postsynaptic beta 2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, via the formation of cyclic AMP. Non-selective beta-blockers with alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking activity: Non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockers with alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity, such as carvedilol, labetalol, medroxalol and bucindolol, combine the advantages of beta- and alpha 1-blockade, including peripheral vasodilation. As an example of this class of agent, carvedilol has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertension by reducing peripheral resistance. There are some indications, still to be confirmed, that it improves left ventricular diastolic function and causes regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and that it may be useful in the treatment of some patients with congestive heart failure or arrhythmia. In animal models of myocardial ischemia, carvedilol has proved to be cardioprotective.", 
    "60": "Risk factors in elderly hypertensives: Recent large-scale clinical trials have shown that antihypertensive treatment in the elderly produces meaningful reductions in strokes and other cardiovascular events. However, the treatment of hypertension in older patients is often complicated by the presence of concomitant disorders. Clinical and silent myocardial ischemia, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and both systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, frequently coexist with hypertension. Additional clinical considerations in elderly hypertensives include a high prevalence of abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism and a tendency toward decreased renal function. Effects of different antihypertensive drugs: Although diuretics and conventional beta-blockers have been used as first-line drugs in the major clinical trials, some of their effects on metabolic parameters and on the myocardium can make them inappropriate in some patients. Newer drug classes, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers and, more recently, alpha 1-adrenergic blockers are effective alternatives. Dual-acting beta-blockers offer an important new approach for treating hypertension in elderly patients. Effects of carvedilol: Carvedilol possesses both beta- and alpha 1-blocking activity and appears to exhibit calcium channel blocking activity in animals. The alpha 1-blocking properties of this drug help to produce a desirable hemodynamic profile and facilitate appropriate blood pressure and heart rate responses to exercise. Carvedilol does not appear to adversely affect left ventricular systolic function and, in selected patients with heart failure, has been shown to increase the ejection fraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "64": "Cocaine administration elicits a pressor response reportedly dependent upon central and peripheral actions. The present study was designed specifically to determine whether cocaine affects baroreflex sensitivity and whether this is mediated by an action in the CNS. Baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by noting the change in the duration of the arterial pulse pressure or in the heart rate elicited by administration of pressor and depressor agents. The effects of intracerebroventricular and intravenous cocaine administration were compared. Cocaine (0.1-0.15 mg/kg/min, i.v.) produced a decrease in baroreflex sensitivity that was greater than that produced by an approximately equipressor infusion of phenylephrine (0.5-1.3 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of cocaine (1.5-150 micrograms) or procaine (100 micrograms) had no effect on arterial pressure, heart rate or baroreflex control of heart rate. Furthermore, central administration of yohimbine (3 and 10 micrograms, i.c.v.) was capable of preventing the suppression of the heart rate responses induced by cocaine administration. Propranolol (15 micrograms, i.c.v.) was not able to attenuate the suppression of baroreflex sensitivity elicited by intravenous cocaine administration but higher doses (50-150 micrograms, i.c.v.) could mimic this effect. These data suggest that cocaine suppresses baroreflex control of heart rate by a central alpha 2-adrenergic mechanism. In contrast, the pressor response to intravenous cocaine is not likely to be dependent upon a forebrain periventricular site.",

The beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor blocking properties of orally administered R- and S-timolol were compared in a double-blind placebo controlled trial in two groups of healthy men. Each subject in group A (n = 6) received placebo, 1 and 3 mg S-timolol and 25 and 75 mg R-timolol in random order, group B (n = 5) received placebo, 0.5, and 1 mg S-timolol and 3 and 10 mg R-timolol. In both groups, R- and S-timolol comparably inhibited isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate (P < .05), forearm blood flow (P < .05, except at 3 micrograms/minute of isoproterenol after the R-doses in group B), and finger tremor (P < .05) in comparison with placebo. The findings for the R-enantiomer in this study were unexpected based on the animal studies and previous studies that demonstrated marked differences in beta blocking effects of other beta-blockers in which the R-enantiomers were less inhibitory.", 
    "66": "The effect of exercise training on the antilipolytic action of insulin was studied in rat adipocytes. Exercise training enhanced lipolysis induced by norepinephrine. Insulin dose dependently inhibited norepinephrine- (1 microM) stimulated lipolysis in both groups. Its inhibition rate was significantly greater in the trained than in the control group. Thus, exercise training enhanced the antilipolytic action of insulin. In the control group, insulin (1,000 microU/ml) reduced the displacement rate of [3H]CGP-12177 binding to adipocytes by low concentrations of (-)-norepinephrine. The slope factor without insulin was 0.76, whereas that with insulin was 0.95. In the trained group, insulin did not affect the competition binding of (-)-norepinephrine for [3H]CGP-12177. The displacement rate of [3H]CGP-12177 binding from adipocytes by low concentrations of (-)-norepinephrine was significantly greater in the trained than in the control group. The number of surface beta-adrenergic receptors per adipocyte was smaller in the trained than in the control group. Cilostamide, which blocks the antilipolytic action of insulin, restored lipolysis in both groups. The recovery rate was significantly greater in the trained than in the control group. These findings suggest that the enhanced antilipolytic action by insulin in the trained group occurs at a site distal to the binding of norepinephrine to beta-adrenergic receptors and that it is due to the increased activity of particulate low-Michaelis constant phosphodiesterase.", 
    "67": "To explore the effect of beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation and blockade on the extraction of monosaccharide from the upper gut, we first established the malabsorption threshold in 26 normal volunteers using a series of test meals containing varying proportions of fructose and glucose. Incomplete small intestinal extraction and consequent arrival of carbohydrate into the caecum was identified by a rise in exhaled breath hydrogen concentration. The malabsorption threshold varied between individuals from 30 to 80 g fructose (median 40 g) but was reproducible within individuals, with 90% agreement of repeat studies. The malabsorption threshold for an individual was unrelated to body height (tau = 0.007, P > 0.05) or weight (tau = 0.003, P > 0.05) but correlated closely with time to onset of the breath hydrogen rise of a standard meal (tau = 0.70, P < 0.001). Administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (160 mg) reduced the quantity of fructose required to exceed the malabsorption threshold from 45, 30-60 (median and range) to 40, 30-50 g (P = 0.03); administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonist isoprenaline (0.015 micrograms.kg/min) increased the quantity of fructose required to exceed the malabsorption threshold by 10 g (55 (50-90) g; P < 0.02). The effect of both drugs correlated closely with their transit effect (tau = 0.79, P < 0.01). A beta-adrenoreceptor mediated pathway thus appears to be capable of influencing the extraction of monosaccharide from the small intestine in normal subjects both under resting and stimulated conditions, probably acting via an effect on upper gastrointestinal motility.",

    "70": "The cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II were examined in aortic blood pressure-controlled and -uncontrolled pithed rats. Angiotensin II induced a dose-dependent increase in diastolic blood pressure, left ventricular pressure (LVP), dP/dt (the first derivative of LVP) and heart rate in pithed rats. The maximal responses for these parameters were similar to those to noradrenaline, except for the rise in diastolic blood pressure, where noradrenaline caused a greater increase than angiotensin II. After treatment with propranolol, the positive chronotropic effect of angiotensin II was abolished. Angiotensin II produced a dose-dependent increase in diastolic blood pressure, which was similar to that of vasopressin, and an increase in dP/dtmax, which proved much greater than that of vasopressin. When aortic blood pressure was controlled and the beta-receptors were blocked by propranolol, angiotensin II caused a dose-dependent increase in dP/dtmax without affecting the left ventricular enddiastolic pressure. The same results were obtained after both beta- and alpha-adrenoceptors were blocked by propranolol and phentolamine. Losartan but not PD123177 caused parallel rightward shifts of the dose-response curve of angiotensin II for dP/dtmax in the aortic blood pressure controlled pithed rat without altering the maximal response. It is concluded that in the pithed rat angiotensin II produced an increase in myocardial contractile force which is not mediated by beta- or alpha-adrenoceptors. The inotropic effect appears to be mediated by angiotensin receptors, of the AT1-subtype.",

Pharmacological tools were employed to isolate and characterize the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated components of this response. The degree to which the drugs influenced NA release or reuptake was assessed by their effects on the electrochemically determined, stimulation-induced rise in the NA concentration at the innervated outer surface of the media. This response was unaffected by alpha,beta-methylene ATP (10 microM) or suramin (500 microM), added to desensitize or block P2-purinoceptors, respectively prazosin (0.1 microM) or SK&F 104078 (6-chloro-9-[(3-methyl-2-butenyl)oxyl]-3-methyl- 1H-2,3,4,5-tetrohydro-3-benzazepine, 0.1 microM), used to block postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors respectively, nifedipine (10 microM), blocker of Ca2+ influx through L-type channels, and ryanodine (10 microM), which blocks mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores; it was moderately enhanced by yohimbine (0.1 microM), blocker of pre- and postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors, and strongly enhanced by cocaine (3 microM) or desipramine (1 microM), blockers of NA reuptake. Judging from their inhibitory effects on the contractile responses to the alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists, phenylephrine and xylazine, prazosin (0.1 microM) and SK&F 104078 (0.1 microM) could be used to selectively block alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors respectively, while yohimbine (0.1 microM) was less selective, strongly depressing alpha 2- and slightly depressing alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated responses. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated component of the contractile response to short trains at 20 Hz was fast in onset, brief in duration and abolished by ryanodine; that mediated by alpha 2-adrenoceptors was more delayed, prolonged and insensitive to ryanodine. Both components were dose-dependently depressed by nifedipine (0.1-10 microM). The small contractile responses to single pulses, or up to 50 pulses at 2 Hz, or short train (< 4 pulses) at 20 Hz, were more markedly depressed by 0.1 microM yohimbine or SK&F 104078 than by 0.1 microM prazosin and, hence, mediated mainly by alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The reverse was true of the much larger response to longer trains at 20 Hz, which thus probably was mediated mainly by alpha 1-adrenoceptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In a first series of experiments, concentration-response curves to isoprenaline and forskolin were compared on strips taken from proximal and distal portions of the vein.

The maximal relaxation to isoprenaline was significantly larger in the distal than in the proximal portion, for responses starting at 85 and 70% of the maximum tone. In contrast, forskolin caused 100% relaxation, both proximally and distally, irrespective of the previous tone. In a second series of experiments, the relaxation to dobutamine and terbutaline was compared in proximal and distal portions after the tone had been elevated by adrenaline, noradrenaline and phenylephrine to about 70% of the maximum.

NZ-105 (10 mg kg-1 day-1) alone and its combined treatment with propranolol (20 mg kg-1 day-1) maintained the systolic blood pressure and heart rate at a low level compared with the control group. The hypotensive action of NZ-105 were reproducible after repeated dosing for 12 weeks.

Competition between (-)-[125I]-CYP (500 pM) and (+/-)-tertatolol, (+/-)-nadolol, (+/-)-alprenolol, (+/-)-CYP, and (-) and (+)-pindolol showed that these compounds competed for binding at the propranolol-resistant site with affinities lower than those displayed at typical beta-adrenoceptors. The atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists BRL 37344, SR58611A and ICI D7114 and the partial agonist (+/-)-CGP 12177 also competed for (-)-[125I]-CYP binding. 5. Stereoselectivity was demonstrated for the stereoisomers of alprenolol and tertalolol. The (-)-isomers of alprenolol and tertalolol had higher affinity than their corresponding (+)-isomers (3.1 and 2.6 fold respectively). These low stereoselectivity values are a characteristic of atypical beta-adrenoceptors. 6. The beta-adrenoceptor agonists, (-)-adrenaline, (-)-isoprenaline and (-)-noradrenaline, all showed lower affinity than the atypical beta-adrenoceptor agonists and competition curves appeared biphasic in nature. 7. These results confirm the presence of a propranolol-resistant (- )-[125I]-CYP binding site in rat soleus muscle.

    "76": "Catecholamines play a major role during initiation and propagation of myocardial ischemia (MI). Therefore their influence on the size of an acute regional MI was investigated in isolated, coronary ligated rabbit hearts during electrical pacing at different rates (Langendorff, constant pressure: 70 cm H2O, Tyrode solution, Ca2+ 1.8 mmol/l). MI was quantified from NADH-surface-fluorescence-photography. After coronary occlusion the stimulation-rate was increased stepwise from 180 beats/min to 300/min. Experiments were performed in hearts of control and reserpinized rabbits (reserpine 7.0 mg/kg i.p. 24 h before preparation). Hearts of control animals were submitted to beta-blockade by propranolol (10(-8) mol/l) or the partial agonists pindolol (10(-6) mol/l) or carteolol (10(-6) mol/l). In untreated control hearts MI was significantly enlarged with increasing heart-rate (p < 0.05). At 300/min MI was doubled as compared to that observed at 180/min. In hearts of reserpinized animals this effect was absent (p > 0.05). Moreover, in control hearts the growth of MI could be prevented by beta-blockade with propranolol, pindolol or carteolol (p > 0.05), however, these hearts became insufficient as indicated by an increase in left ventricular enddiastolic pressure. Therefore we conclude that the pacing-rate dependent growth of MI seems not to be primarily related to myocardial left ventricular pressure nor to the heart rate. Nevertheless the growth of MI is strictly related to the release of catecholamines and might be caused by oxygen free radicals generated from noradrenaline by autoxidation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Of the 58 consecutively studied patients ischemic responses were found in 13 (45%) of 29 patients initially treated with placebo, and in 21 (72%) of 29 alteplase treated patients (P = 0.03).

Alteplase treated patients more often had late myocardial ischemia, and cardiac events were found in patients with ischemia. Since the ASSET trial has demonstrated significantly higher short- and long-term survival rate in the alteplase treated group, it was indicated (1) that alteplase treated patients were better positioned for sustaining subsequent ischemia and thus cardiac events due to preservation of viable myocardial tissue, and (2) that late ischemia in the setting of initial alteplase treatment may convey other information than ischemia occurring in placebo treated patients.",

    "84": "Pafenolol is a beta-blocker with unusual oral absorption properties. The blood concentration-time profile exhibits two peaks, and the bioavailability is low and dose dependent because of incomplete and nonlinear intestinal uptake. We addressed the question whether the intestinal absorption of pafenolol was affected by bile depletion in the gut lumen of rats. Further, the hypothesis that variable gastric emptying accounts for double peaks in blood was tested by duodenal administration of pafenolol. Following intraduodenal administration to rats with intact bile secretion, double peaks were observed in the blood concentration-time curve. The bioavailability was 6.8 +/- 0.7% for the low dose (1 mumol/kg) and increased significantly to 28 +/- 10% following the high duodenal dose (25 mumol/kg). These blood concentration-time profiles exclude interrupted gastric emptying as cause of the twin peaks. In bile duct-cannulated rats the intestinal absorption of the low dose (1 mumol/kg) was still poor (F = 10.7 +/- 5.5%) and the blood concentration-time profile contained two peaks. Following administration of a high duodenal dose (25 mumol/kg) to rats with an almost bile-free small intestine, the absorption rate increased and the double-peak phenomenon disappeared in five of seven rats, while the bioavailability increased significantly, to 62 +/- 27%. These results suggest that the low bioavailability of pafenolol is due to a complexation between bile and pafenolol in the gut lumen, preventing intestinal uptake in the major part of the small intestine. Further, such complex formation in the intestinal lumen may be the underlying mechanism of the double peaks observed in the blood concentration-time profile.",

Ouabain (1.7 micrograms kg-1 min-1, i.v.), an inhibitor of the Na,K-pumps, inhibited both salbutamol-and BRL 37344-mediated hypokalaemia. 6. These data suggest the coexistence of beta 2- and beta 3-adrenoceptor control of extrarenal potassium disposal; moreover both beta 2 and beta 3 hypokalaemic effects would be mediated by activation of Na,K-pumps.", 
    "86": "This study investigated the effects of isamoltane on the changes induced by cumulative doses of inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) on bronchomotor tone, skeletal muscle, circulatory system, and metabolism after single (day 1) and multiple dosing (day 7) in 15 healthy subjects. The volunteers were given placebo, 4 mg isamoltane, 10 mg isamoltane, or 20 mg propranolol over a 7-day period in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The greatest attenuation in albuterol-induced beta-adrenergic receptor responses occurred with propranolol. The median provocative dose of albuterol causing a 50% increase in specific airway conductance was 337 and 315 micrograms (day 1 and day 7, respectively) for placebo, 336 and 322 micrograms for 4 mg isamoltane, 344 and 389 micrograms for 10 mg isamoltane, and 667 and 652 micrograms for propranolol. The provocative dose of albuterol producing a 35% increase in tremor was 464 and 539 micrograms (day 1 and day 7, respectively) for placebo, 1122 and 1270 micrograms for 4 mg isamoltane, 1612 and > 1612 micrograms for 10 mg isamoltane, and > 1612 and > 1612 micrograms for propranolol. On day 5 of each period an exercise test was performed. Propranolol reduced exercise heart rate by 11% (compared with placebo), 10 mg isamoltane reduced heart rate by 5%, and 4 mg isamoltane reduced heart rate by 1%. In conclusion, low-dose isamoltane caused measurable systemic effects on both beta 2- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors, and the dose-dependent blockade on beta 2-receptors of skeletal muscle was more clear than the attenuation of exercise heart rate.", 
    "87": "The role of the central nervous system in the pressor effect of nicotine is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the cardiovascular effects of nicotine in the lower brainstem of normotensive and hypertensive rats. Microinjection of nicotine (0.012-3696 pmol/60 nl) into the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema of Sprague-Dawley (SD), Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) decreased blood pressure and heart rate. In contrast, administration of similar doses of nicotine within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) evoked a long-lasting pressor and tachycardic effect. This pressor effect was completely abolished by prior microinjection of hexamethonium. In SHR the depressor and bradycardic responses in the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema were similar to those of normotensive animals. The pressor effect in the RVLM, however, was more pronounced in the SHR than in WKY or SD rats. In additional experiments, the changes produced by intra-RVLM administration of nicotine on renal sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated before and after equidepressor intravenous doses of either clonidine, labetalol or prazosin. The prior administration of labetalol antagonized the pressor effect of nicotine in the three strains of rats (SHR, 82 +/- 6%; SD, 96 +/- 4%; WKY, 83 +/- 9%). Prazosin inhibited the nicotine pressor response by 69% in SHR, by 44% in SD and by 70% in WKY. Clonidine had no effect on nicotine response in the three groups of rats. In conclusion, nicotine administration within the RVLM increases renal sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Experiments were carried out to study the effects of denopamine on myocardial alpha-1 adrenoceptors in the rabbit and on intracellular Ca++ transients in the dog ventricular muscle. Denopamine displaced the specific binding of the alpha-1 receptor antagonist [3H]prazosin with high and low affinities in the membrane fraction derived from the rabbit ventricle. The positive inotropic effect (PIE) of denopamine, however, was not affected by prazosin. A beta receptor antagonist bupranolol antagonized the PIE of denopamine in a concentration-dependent manner. In the rabbit denopamine acted as a beta receptor partial agonist with an intrinsic activity of 0.8 and shifted the concentration-response curve for isoproterenol to the right (Kp = 1.5 microM). In addition, denopamine attenuated the maximal inotropic response to phenylephrine mediated by alpha-1 receptors, but did not affect the pD2 value for phenylephrine. In isolated dog right ventricular muscle, the bell-shaped concentration-response relationship for the inotropic effect of denopamine was associated with coinciding increase and decrease in the amplitude of aequorin light transients. The relationship between the increase in peak Ca++ transients and developed tension in response to denopamine was the same as the relation during administration of isoproterenol. The present results indicate that denopamine binds myocardial alpha-1 adrenoceptors with high affinity and may thereby inhibit the maximal response of phenylephrine mediated by alpha-1 receptors. The PIE of denopamine is mediated exclusively by beta receptors. The change in Ca++ sensitivity caused by denopamine may not be different from that induced by a beta receptor full agonist isoproterenol.", 
    "89": "The hemodynamic and beta adrenergic blocking effects of GI104313, a chimeric molecule containing a phosphodiesterase-inhibiting pyradazinone and a beta blocking phenoxpropanolamine, were examined in barbiturate-anesthetized, vagotomized dogs. The results of these studies were compared to those of indolidan, a known phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and xamoterol, a partial beta adrenoceptor agonist. The compounds were infused at six increasing dose rates in 10-min intervals. Isoproterenol (0.5 microgram/kg) was administered before each dose increment to determine beta adrenoceptor responsiveness. In a separate set of experiments, the hemodynamic effects of GI104313, indolidan and xamoterol were examined in the presence of complete beta blockade with atenolol. GI104313 elicited dose-dependent increases in heart rate, contractility (+dP/dt) and cardiac output and decreases in arterial blood pressure, left ventricular end diastolic pressure and systemic vascular resistance in unpretreated and atenolol-pretreated dogs. However, GI104313 was less potent hemodynamically in atenolol-pretreated animals. This was evidenced by a 4-fold dextral shift in the dose-response relation for several hemodynamic variables. In unpretreated dogs, GI104313 elicited potent dose-dependent blockade of the heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and +dP/dt responses to isoproterenol. Greater than 95% inhibition of isoproterenol response was attained at 1 mumol/kg GI104313 for all observed variables. Indolidan increased contractility and heart rate and decreased diastolic blood pressure in a dose-related fashion. Indolidan did not modify the stimulatory effects of isoproterenol. Atenolol had modest effects on indolidan's hemodynamic effect, only shifting its inotropic effect 2-fold. Xamoterol produced hemodynamic and beta blocking effects similar to GI104313.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "Sympathetic neural activation of vascular smooth muscle beta-receptors induces membrane hyperpolarization and arterial relaxation. This response, which likely is mediated by the Gs protein-adenylyl cyclase-cyclic AMP signaling cascade, is reduced in some hypertensive animal models and in human essential hypertension. Since reduced beta-receptor-mediated vasodilation is a potential mechanism for enhanced arterial resistance, this study was designed to identify which step (or steps) in the beta-receptor signaling cascade is altered in hypertension. Transmembrane potentials were recorded in situ in small first-order arterioles and venules of cremaster muscle from hypertensive, reduced renal mass rats and normotensive, sham-operated controls. Vascular muscle cells in arterioles and venules of hypertensive rats were 5-7 mV more depolarized than in respective vessels of control rats during superfusion with physiological salt solution. Hyperpolarization and depolarization responses were reduced in hypertensive rats during superfusion with a beta-receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively, suggesting attenuated beta-receptor responsiveness compared with normotensive rats. Furthermore, direct activation of Gs protein by 10 ng/mL cholera toxin did not affect arterial or venous transmembrane potential in hypertensive rats, but hyperpolarized arterial and venous vascular muscle in normotensive controls by 17 mV. However, when the Gs protein-adenylate cyclase coupling step of the beta-receptor cascade was bypassed by using 10(-5) M forskolin to directly activate adenylate cyclase, arterial and venous vascular muscle of hypertensive rats hyperpolarized by 25-27 mV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We found 287 patients from 26 centers in seven countries. Mean +/- SD age at presentation was 6.8 +/- 5.6; 9% presented with cardiac arrest, 26% with syncope, and 10% with seizures. Of those with symptoms, 67% had symptoms related to exercise. Family history was positive for long QT interval in 39% and for sudden death in 31%. Hearing loss was present in 4.5%. A normal QTc was present in 6%, and QTc of more than 0.60 was in 13%. Atrioventricular block occurred in 5%, but 13 of 15 patients had second-degree atrioventricular block (2:1), and only two of 287 had complete atrioventricular block. Ventricular arrhythmias were found on 16% of initial routine ECGs: 4% uniform premature ventricular contractions, 5% multiform premature ventricular contractions, 1% monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, and 6% torsade de pointes. Overall, treatment was effective for symptoms in 76% and for ventricular arrhythmias in 60%. There was no difference between propranolol and other beta-blockers in effective treatment. Left stellectomy was performed in nine patients, and defibrillators were implanted in four; no sudden death occurred in these 13 patients. In follow-up (duration, 5.0 +/- 4 years; age, 10.9 +/- 6.3 years), 5% had cardiac arrest, 4% had syncope, and 1% had seizures. The two multivariate predictors of symptoms at follow-up were symptoms at presentation and propranolol failure. Sudden death occurred in 8%; multivariate predictors of sudden death were length of QTc at presentation of more than 0.60 and medication noncompliance.", 
    "93": "The appearance of 2:1 atrioventricular block, multiform premature ventricular contractions, and torsade de pointes are relatively more common in children with LQTS than other children and should raise the index of suspicion for LQTS. Because 9% of patients presented with cardiac arrest and no preceding symptoms, perhaps prophylactic treatment in asymptomatic children is indicated. Asymptomatic patients with normal QTc and positive family history may be a low-risk group. Patients with QTc of more than 0.60 are at particularly high risk for sudden death, and if treatment is not effective, consideration should be given to cardiac sympathetic denervation, pacemaker implantation, and perhaps implantation of a defibrillator.", 
    "94": "High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, and apo A-II levels were measured in 1,219 normal subjects with no clinical evidence of coronary artery disease, 81 subjects without diabetes but with \"significant\" coronary artery disease determined by coronary arteriography, and 151 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (48 with clinical coronary artery disease and 103 without such disease). In the normal subjects, apo A-II levels were less influenced by age, gender, and use of medications than were apo A-I or HDL-C levels. HDL-C, apo A-I, and apo A-II levels were significantly lower in subjects who had coronary artery disease with or without diabetes than in control subjects. After adjustments were made for age and sex, however, apo A-II levels were no longer significantly different between subjects with diabetes who had and those who did not have coronary artery disease. In subjects without diabetes, apo A-II may provide some advantages over apo A-I and HDL-C in the assessment of risk of coronary artery disease because it is influenced less by age, gender, and medications. In subjects with diabetes, however, apo A-II levels are similar in the presence or absence of coronary artery disease.", 
    "95": "The effects of p-octopamine injected i.v. and i.p on salivary flow rates and proteins secreted by the submandibular glands of rats were studied with and without various types of autonomic blockers at different doses, and with two enzyme inhibitors. The salivary flow rates and the amounts of protein secreted progressively increased with increasing doses injected both i.v. and i.p., whereas they were dramatically reduced with almost all autonomic blockers and disulfiram, a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor. Salivation was completely abolished in response to p-octopamine in combination with metoprolol or phenoxybenzamine at high doses, and simultaneous injections of prazosin and propranolol. The concentration of protein in submandibular saliva in response to p-octopamine injected i.v. and i.p. was not dose-dependent and significantly increased with all of the alpha-blockers except yohimbine, and with atropine and disulfiram. The protease activity was dose-dependent but was reduced significantly with alpha-blockers except yohimbine and with two enzyme inhibitors. The alpha-type of protein was secreted in response to p-octopamine injected i.v. and i.p. at all doses except with the lowest dose i.p., which caused the beta-type to be secreted. The alpha-type was completely replaced by the beta-type with all alpha-blockers at all doses, except with yohimbine, but no change was observed with various types of beta-blockers, yohimbine, atropine, and two enzyme inhibitors. Thus, p-octopamine could stimulate both the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the submandibular glands of rats.", 
    "96": "Several studies have demonstrated a circadian rhythm in the onset of myocardial infarction. Most show a peak rate between 8 and 12 o'clock in the morning. The frequency of infarction in this time period is one and a half to two times that observed during the rest of the day. This phenomenon has been observed in different countries and does not seem to be influenced by the characteristics of the population (sex, previous infarction). However, this circadian rhythm seems less pronounced in younger subjects. The prescription of calcium antagonists before infarction does not change the circadian rhythm whereas aspirin and betablocker therapy decrease the frequency of matinal infarction. The mechanism underlying the circadian rhythm is hypothetical: many factors could play a triggering role and circadian variations in coagulation, platelet aggregation, catecholamine levels and blood pressure may also be important. Recent studies have shown that the morning peak in onset of infarction could be related to the times of waking and getting up. Suppression of the morning peak of infarction (and also of episodes of myocardial ischaemia and sudden death) with betablocker therapy, suggests a direct or indirect role of circulating catecholamines in the induction of the phenomena leading to infarction. When using betablockers, the authors suggest prescribing the doses so as to obtain therapeutic efficacy in the morning.", 
    "97": "A large body of evidence has conclusively shown that the majority of ischaemic events that occur in patients with chronic stable angina (CSA) and severe coronary artery disease are not precipitated by a sudden increase in MVO2 exceeding the possibility of increase in coronary blood flow. Although the observation suggests that these events are caused by transient impairment of regional myocardial perfusion, common practice as well as controlled clinical trials indicate that betablockers are extremely effective in this condition. This apparent contradiction is partly explained by the observation that, in these patients, episodes of ischaemia predominate in the day time (from 7 am to 11 pm), when heart rate and blood pressure are tonically increased, due to the presence of high sympathetic tone. This suggests that transient ischaemic events probably occur when phasic reductions in coronary blood flow are superimposed on high resting levels of myocardial metabolic demand. By lowering heart rate, blood pressure and contractility, betablockers reduce cardiac requirements and decrease the likelihood for transient reductions in regional myocardial perfusion to reach the critical ischaemic threshold. We studied 20 patients with CSA, severe coronary disease and frequent daily episodes of myocardial ischaemia. They all received three different treatment schedules with atenolol 100 mg (od), diltiazem 120 mg (tds) and atenolol 100 mg (od) + nifedipine 20 mg SR (tds) and underwent serial recordings of the ambulatory ECG. Although both monotherapies significantly reduced the frequency and duration of cardiac ischaemic events atenolol was significantly more effective than diltiazem. Predictably, the betablocker calcium antagonist combination afforded the best therapeutic response.", 
    "98": "Three groups of anaesthetized rats, consisting of 8 rats per group, were studied. Group 1 was the control and received intravenous injection of nicotine, 50 micrograms/kg, only. Groups II and III were pretreated with propranolol, 0.5mg/kg and prazosin, 1mg/kg respectively before 50 micrograms/kg of nicotine was injected i.v. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and amplitude of respiratory excursion were monitored continuously before and for 1 hr after the injections. Index of Pulmonary Ventilation Rate was computed as a product of amplitude of respiratory excursion and respiratory rate. The results showed that nicotine caused an initial fall in blood pressure followed by a rise. The initial fall in blood pressure was abolished by prazosin, while propranolol abolished the pressor response. Nicotine had no effect on heart rate in the three groups. Nicotine caused an increase in respiratory rate and this effect was abolished by prazosin. Nicotine also caused an initial increase in pulmonary ventilation which was due mainly to increase in respiratory rate. It was concluded that nicotine exerts most of its cardiorespiratory effect via stimulation of alpha and beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "99": "The effect of vesnarinone (OPC-8212), an orally active positive inotropic agent was studied in tracheal muscle isolated from guinea pigs, and the mechanism of its action was analyzed. Vesnarinone (10(-6)-10(-4) M) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of tracheal muscle pre-contracted by 10(-4) M histamine. The potency of the relaxing effect of vesnarinone was greater than that of theophylline; the pD2 values for vesnarinone and theophylline were 4.9 and 4.5, respectively. Vesnarinone reduced the high-K(+)-induced contracture of depolarized tracheal muscle non-competitively (pD'2 = 3.7). Vesnarinone at the low concentration of 3 x 10(-6) M shifted the concentration-response curve for isoproterenol in a parallel fashion to the left. Vesnarinone additively acted on the relaxing effect of isobutyl methyl xanthine. Propranolol (10(-5) M) and reserpine pre-treatment (5 mg/kg, i.p., 24 hr) had no effect on the relaxing effect of vesnarinone. These results suggested that vesnarinone elevated the intracellular cyclic AMP level via phosphodiesterase inhibition, resulting in the tracheal muscle relaxation.", 
    "100": "Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is a severely disabling condition due to deficient peripheral vasoconstrictor tone in response to the upright position and is characterized by a decrease in blood pressure upon standing associated with symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness, visual \"white-out\", weakness, lack of energy, near syncope or even syncope. Previous pharmacologic treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension has been problematic. Midodrine, a new specific alpha-1-agonist has been shown to produce arteriolar constriction and decrease in venous pooling via a constriction of venous capacitance vessels. Therefore, a recent multicenter study evaluated the safety and efficacy of midodrine therapy in 97 patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension due to various etiologies: Shy Drager syndrome (No. 18); Bradbury Eggleston syndrome (idiopathic orthostatic hypotension) (No. 20); diabetic autonomic neuropathy (No. 27); Parkinson's disease (No. 22); and miscellaneous (No. 10). Following one week of placebo therapy, the patients were randomized into 4 groups for a 4 week period of time; placebo, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg three times daily. The BE/SDS subgroup demonstrated a 27 +/- 8% (22 mmHg) increase in standing systolic blood pressure for the 10 mg dose. Diabetics achieved a significant increase at 5 mg. Similar increases were observed for the entire group on the 10 mg dose (p < 0.001). Symptoms or fainting, blurred vision, improved energy level, standing time, and depressed feelings were also significantly improved even at lower doses (p < 0.05 or less). Side effects were mild. Therefore, midodrine is an effective and safe agent for the treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.", 
    "101": "We have postulated elsewhere (Shaw CA and Lanius RA. Dev Brain Res 70, 153-161 (1992)) that the kinase/phosphatase regulation of AMPA receptors is mediated by specific ions. Using an in vitro cortical slice preparation we have now examined the roles of calcium (Ca2+), chloride (Cl-), potassium (K+), and sodium (Na+) in the regulation of AMPA receptors. Ca2+ led to a concentration-dependent decrease in [3H]-CNQX binding which could be blocked by a general protein kinase inhibitor (H-7) and a protein kinase A inhibiting peptide. Tamoxifen, a relatively specific protein kinase C inhibitor, had no effect. In contrast, Cl- led to concentration-dependent increases in [3H]-CNQX binding which could be blocked by both sodium-ortho-vanadate, a tyrosine residue selective phosphatase inhibitor, and sodium-beta-D-glycerol phosphate, a serine residue selective phosphatase blocker. K+ and Na+ had no effect on [3H]-CNQX binding. These results suggest that Ca2+ and Cl- may be acting as signals which trigger kinase(s) and phosphatase(s) involved in the regulation of AMPA receptors.",

In isolated guinea pig left atria, the positive inotropic EC50 values (microM) in order of potency were about 0.18 (NSP-805), 0.39 (indolidan), 1.1 (MCI-154), 1.7 (NSP-804, milrinone), 2.0 (denopamine), 4.0 (papaverine), 4.4 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, IBMX, 6.5 (imazodan), and 27 (amrinone). In anesthetized dogs, intravenous (i.v.) injection of NSP-804 and NSP-805 produced dose-dependent increases in left ventricular VVdp/dtmax and decreases in aortic blood pressure (ABP) with relatively small increases in heart rate (HR). The ED50 values (micrograms/kg) for LVdP/dtmax of NSP-804, NSP-805, denopamine, milrinone, MCI-154, and indolidan were 15, 12, 22, 23, 15, and 7.3, respectively. When the drugs were administered intraduodenally to anesthetized dogs, the ED50 values (micrograms/kg) for LVdP/dtmax of NSP-804, NSP-805, milrinone and indolidan were approximately 30, 10, 200, and 25 respectively. In the propranolol-induced heart failure model, NSP-804 and NSP-805 completely improved the hemodynamic state of heart failure to normal levels. The in vitro positive inotropic effects of NSP-804 and NSP-805 were accompanied by increases in tissue cyclic AMP and abolished by carbachol. NSP-805 was the most potent and selective inhibitor of guinea pig cardiac phosphodiesterase (PDE) III among the agents examined, and NSP-804 was a potent and selective inhibitor of PDE III similar to indolidan. The cardiovascular properties determined in this study suggest that both NSP-804 and NSP-805 may have beneficial effects for treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF).", 
    "103": "Among antiarrhythmic agents, those belonging to class III are considered most promising. Class III drugs act by prolonging the action potential duration (APD), which increases the effective refractory period (ERP). This effect can be achieved by several different cellular mechanisms. We hypothesized that among other variables the mechanism of action could be important for the propensity of class III agents to have proarrhythmic effects. We investigated the effects of sotalol (a potassium channel blocker) and DPI 201-106 (DPI, an activator of sodium channels) at doses causing the same increase in ERP, using programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in open-chest rabbits. After baseline measurements, three cumulative doses of DPI (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg) or sotalol (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle (placebo) were infused. Before drug administration, PES elicited arrhythmias in 11 of 21 animals. These arrhythmias remained unchanged in the placebo group and decreased dose dependently with sotalol. DPI, however, increased the inducibility of arrhythmias in all animals at the third dose. The two agents differed with respect to their effect on ERP2, measured with a second extrastimulus. In contrast to ERP1, which was prolonged to the same extent by both drugs, ERP2 was prolonged more by sotalol than by DPI. Proarrhythmic effects of sotalol could not be shown in this model. Our results suggest that the cellular mechanism that causes the class III effect is an important factor with respect to the occurrence of proarrhythmic activity.", 
    "104": "Myocardial alpha 1-adrenoceptor number has been reported to increase during ischaemia in myocytes consequent to an increase in acyl carnitine levels. We investigated whether this phenomenon occurs in vivo and whether the novel antiischaemic agent ranolazine will protect against it. Thirty-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in anaesthetised rats produced an approximate doubling of the left ventricular (LV) alpha 1-adrenoceptor population. The carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) inhibitor sodium 2-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-pentylene]oxiran-2-carboxylate (POCA 100 micrograms/kg) reduced this ischaemia-induced increase when administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 15 min before ischaemia and abolished the increase when administered intravenously (i.v.). The CPT1 inhibitor sodium 2-tetradecyl oxirane carboxylate dihydrate (TGDA) (500 micrograms/kg) inhibited the upregulation when administered i.p. and significantly decreased alpha 1-adrenoceptor density when administered i.v.; however, this agent, unlike POCA, reduced [3H]-prazosin binding directly. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) did not prevent the increase. Direct addition of palmitoyl carnitine (10 microM) to membranes from nonischaemic myocardium caused a doubling in alpha 1-adrenoceptor number, and this effect was selective for heart membranes as compared with cerebral cortex; beta-adrenoceptor number was not modified. Ranolazine (500 micrograms/kg) inhibited upregulation when administered 15 min i.v. before ischaemia or after 3-day twice-daily (b.i.d.) i.p. pretreatment.

The nature of this ancillary property is still unknown. The present double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study investigated the effect of 4 and 8 weeks treatment with nebivolol 5 mg once daily on blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), blood parameters, and ECG. The effect on quality of life perception and the adverse effect profile were also studied. Nebivolol 5 mg once daily had a good antihypertensive effect in supine (10/8 mm Hg) as well as in standing position (16/10 mm Hg). Of 114 patients studied, 65% had either normalization of or > 10% reduction in diastolic BP (DBP). No evidence of drug tolerance was observed during the 8-week treatment period. Quality of life perception, as measured with the Inventory of Subjective Health (ISH) and the perceived health rating scale, was not impaired with nebivolol during the entire 8-week study. Nebivolol showed a favorable adverse effect profile and appeared to be devoid of central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects. The total number of complaints with nebivolol treatment did not differ from the number of complaints with placebo treatment. ECG and blood analyses, also show that nebivolol is safe and well tolerated. This study also shows that absolute drug-induced changes in quality of life perception can be assessed only in a placebo-controlled study and that comparison with baseline might be incorrect and misleading.", 
    "106": "In the present study, we investigated the neural mechanisms of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the interactions among CRF, norepinephrine (NE), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) systems in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus in modulating the memory process of rats. One-way passive avoidance task was adopted. Results indicated that CRF (80 ng), when directly injected into the DG, consistently and significantly enhanced memory retention in rats. The noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4, at a high dose (4 micrograms), impaired memory. DSP-4 at a moderate dose (2 micrograms), which did not affect retention alone, antagonized the memory-enhancing effect of CRF. Similarly, the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, at a high dose (8 micrograms), reduced retention. At a low dose (80 ng), which did not markedly affect retention by itself, propranolol also prevented the memory-improving effect of CRF. Moreover, direct NE infusions to the DG significantly improved retention performance in a dose-sensitive manner. Coadministration of CRF and NE did not further enhance retention. These results together suggest that CRF and NE facilitated memory probably through the same instead of independent mechanisms. In contrast, the selective NMDA receptor antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5) and MK801, at high doses markedly impaired memory retention (0.8 and 3.2 micrograms for AP5, 2 and 10 micrograms for MK801). At a dose of MK801 that did not significantly alter retention alone (80 ng), it completely blocked the memory-facilitating effect of CRF. These results indicate that CRF enhanced memory indirectly through NMDA receptor mediation also. Finally, MK801 at 80 ng also successfully antagonized the memory-facilitating effect of NE in the DG. We have demonstrated that MK801, at the dose chosen for interaction studies, did not markedly alter locomotor activity. These results together suggest that CRF, through a presynaptic facilitation mechanism, possibly facilitates NE release in the DG; increased NE release and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the DG result in NMDA receptor activations in the same area. This sequence of events enhance the memory consolidation process in the hippocampus and explained the neural mechanism of CRF in facilitating retention performance in rats.

Rolipram did not inhibit 5-lipoxygenase activity but did inhibit human monocyte production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4, IC50 3.5 microM). Likewise, murine mast cell release of leukotriene C4 and histamine was inhibited. In vivo, rolipram inhibited arachidonic acid-induced inflammation in the mouse, while the low Km-cyclic-GMP PDE inhibitor, zaprinast, did not inhibit. Rolipram had a modest effect on LTB4 production in the mouse, but markedly reduced LTB4-induced PMN infiltration. Beta-adrenergic receptor activation of adenylate cyclase was important for rolipram antiinflammatory activity since beta blockade abrogated arachidonic acid-induced inflammation. Thus, the antiinflammatory profile of rolipram is novel and may result from inhibition of PMN function and perhaps vasoactive amine release and leukotriene biosynthesis. These actions may be dependent upon endogenous beta-adrenergic activity and are likely mediated through inhibition of PDE IV.", 
    "108": "The spinal cord contains noradrenergic (NA) pathways which descend from cell bodies in the medulla oblongata and pons to terminate at all levels in the spinal gray matter. The present studies sought to determine the patterns of postnatal development of pre- and postsynaptic elements of NA transmission in the spinal cord. Significant presynaptic development is evident at birth as reflected by substantial high-affinity uptake of norepinephrine (NE) into synaptosomes (0.65-0.90 pmol/mg protein). There is a subsequent increase in uptake on postnatal day (PND) 5, followed by a decrease in 5-10 days to essentially adult levels, starting on PND 20 (0.30-0.35 pmol/mg protein). This decrease in NE uptake occurs coincident with increases in the density of postsynaptic alpha 1 and beta adrenergic receptors and also NE-stimulated accumulation of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Peaks in the development of alpha 1 receptors (PND 10) and beta receptors (PND 20) and NE-stimulated cAMP accumulation (PND 15) were also followed by decreases to adult levels. The neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was administered at birth to determine the effects of denervation on the development of the spinal NA systems. At each day following 6-OHDA, synaptosomal uptake of [3H]NE was reduced by two-thirds compared with control values. alpha 1 and beta adrenergic receptor binding are uniformly increased along with a parallel increase in NE-stimulated accumulation of cAMP. While uniformly increased over control, the pattern of postnatal increases and decreases in receptors and cAMP accumulation is maintained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "109": "In the isolated, perfused working rat heart, ischemia (15 min) decreased mechanical function and also the tissue levels of ATP and creatine phosphate, and increased the tissue levels of lactate and free fatty acids including arachidonic acid. Reperfusion (20 min) did not restore mechanical function, but restored changes of metabolites incompletely except for free fatty acids, which changed further during reperfusion. Drugs were given 5 min before ischemia until the end of ischemia or for the first 10 min after reperfusion. Both dl- and d-propranolol (10 and 30 microM) decreased mechanical function, accelerated the recovery of mechanical function during reperfusion following ischemia, and attenuated ischemia reperfusion-induced metabolic changes. The attenuation of reperfusion-induced metabolic changes was more marked when these drugs were present during reperfusion. d-Propranolol showed a cardioprotection similar to that by dl-propranolol. Timolol (50 microM) did not accelerate the recovery of mechanical function during reperfusion, and did not attenuate the reperfusion-induced metabolic changes. These results suggest that d-propranolol, like dl-propranolol, has a cardioprotective effect which is probably due to its membrane stabilizing (or sodium channel blocking) action.", 
    "110": "Self-assessment of blood pressure and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) are being more widely used in the diagnosis and therapy of hypertension, in addition to office blood pressure measurement. The present multicenter double-blind study compared cilazapril 2.5 to 5 mg (n = 26) to atenolol 50 to 100 mg (n = 27) over a period course of eight weeks. Office blood pressures in the morning before medication, ABPM over 24 h and self assessment of the blood pressure in the morning and evening were taken. The aim of the study was to find out if the results of ABPM and self assessment of blood pressure are similar when compared to office blood pressure measurement. After four weeks of therapy both cilazapril and atenolol achieved a significant and comparable reduction of blood pressure, which did not change significantly afterwards. Both medications showed a comparable blood pressure control over 24 h. with a once-a-day regimen. The comparison of the three techniques of blood pressure measurement demonstrates that ABPM results in significantly lower average daily values than office blood pressure measurement and that the self-assessed blood pressure values in most cases lie in-between. Although the diastolic ambulatory daily values were on the average 9 mmHg lower than the corresponding office values, it was not possible for an individual patient to accurately predict the ambulatory value obtained by to his office blood pressure value. Similar results were found for the values according to self assessment of blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "111": "To determine the effect of thrombolytic therapy on the frequency of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, and whether RV dysfunction is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality after discharge from the hospital, 1,110 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) II trial with acute inferior wall left ventricular myocardial infarction were studied. RV dysfunction was defined as an RV wall motion abnormality on equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography performed a mean of 9 days after admission to the hospital. Fifty-eight patients (5%) had RV dysfunction. Baseline clinical characteristics among patients with and without RV dysfunction were similar. However, patients with RV dysfunction had a lower mean left ventricular ejection fraction (51.2 +/- 1.2% vs 55.5 +/- 0.3%; p < 0.001) and a greater frequency of in-hospital complications. Angiographic data from patients undergoing protocol catheterization 18 to 48 hours after hospital admission show that the infarct-related artery was more likely to be occluded in those with RV dysfunction (48% [15 of 31] vs 14% [68 of 495]; p < 0.001). There was no difference in the frequency of multivessel disease between the 2 groups. In patients with RV dysfunction in whom radionuclide ventriculography was repeated 6 weeks after hospital discharge, RV wall motion abnormalities persisted in only 18% (8 of 45). Mortality in the year after discharge was 3.5% (2 of 58) among patients with RV dysfunction compared with 1.7% (18 of 1,052; p = NS) among those without RV dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "112": "The anti-asthmatic effects of CS-518 (sodium 2-(1-imidazolylmethyl)-4,5-dihydrobenzo[b]thiophene-6-carboxylate) , a specific thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthase inhibitor, were investigated in the ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pig asthmatic model. Although CS-518 slightly inhibited (about 25%) whole bronchoconstriction, it significantly inhibited the antigen-induced bronchoconstriction mediated by slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), which was not reduced by chlorpheniramine, a histamine H1 antagonist. On the other hand, indomethacin, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, potentiated the SRS-A-mediated constriction. CS-518 strongly, and indomethacin slightly, suppressed the leukotriene D4-induced bronchoconstriction. CS-518 clearly inhibited the antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, but this compound had no effect on the airway hyperresponsiveness induced by U-46619, a TXA2-mimetic agent, and propranolol. These results suggest that CS-518 suppresses the development of bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic models by inhibition of TXA2 synthesis with the concomitant increase in bronchodilating prostaglandins such as prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin I2.", 
    "113": "The diagnosis of chronic headache can be put forward on clinical grounds, if the character of the pain did not change over several years. The most often encountered and treatable cause is a misuse of pain-killers, especially over-the-counter drug combinations. In this situation, only an inpatient treatment will have a chance of success. The basic types of medication are calcium-entry blockers, beta-blocking agents, dihydroergotamine and antidepressive medication of the tricyclic type. The main aim should be to educate the patient to develop self-responsibility instead of offering unapproved methods of treatment."
