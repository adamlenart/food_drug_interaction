This guideline is focused on patients with episodic migraine (headache on \u2264 14 days a month).", 
    "1": "Through a comprehensive search strategy, randomized, double blind, controlled trials of drug treatments for migraine prophylaxis and relevant Cochrane reviews were identified. Studies were graded according to criteria developed by the US Preventive Services Task Force. Recommendations were graded according to the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group. In addition, a general literature review and expert consensus were used for aspects of prophylactic therapy for which randomized controlled trials are not available.", 
    "2": "Prophylactic drug choice should be based on evidence for efficacy, side-effect profile, migraine clinical features, and co-existing disorders. Based on our review, 11 prophylactic drugs received a strong recommendation for use (topiramate, propranolol, nadolol, metoprolol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, candesartan, butterbur, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, and magnesium citrate) and 6 received a weak recommendation (divalproex sodium, flunarizine, pizotifen, venlafaxine, verapamil, and lisinopril). Quality of evidence for different medications varied from high to low. Prophylactic treatment strategies were developed to assist the practitioner in selecting a prophylactic drug for specific clinical situations. These strategies included: first time strategies for patients who have not had prophylaxis before (a beta-blocker and a tricyclic strategy), low side effect strategies (including both drug and herbal/vitamin/mineral strategies), a strategy for patients with high body mass index, strategies for patients with co-existent hypertension or with co-existent depression and /or anxiety, and additional monotherapy drug strategies for patients who have failed previous prophylactic trials. Further strategies included a refractory migraine strategy and strategies for prophylaxis during pregnancy and lactation.", 
    "3": "There is good evidence from randomized controlled trials for use of a number of different prophylactic medications in patients with migraine. Medication choice for an individual patient requires careful consideration of patient clinical features.", 
    "4": "The 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) is an important inflammatory mediator found in high levels in the synovial fluid of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) of patients with inflammatory pain. In this study, we used the nociceptive behavior responses, measured as flinching the head and rubbing the orofacial region, as a nociceptive assay. We demonstrated that the local blockade of the 5-HT\u2083 receptor and \u03b2\u2081 or \u03b2\u2082-adrenoceptors, the depletion of norepinephrine in the sympathetic terminals and the local inhibition of cyclooxygenase significantly reduced 5-HT-induced TMJ nociception. These results demonstrated that 5-HT induces nociception in the TMJ region by the activation of \u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082 adrenoceptors located in the TMJ region and local release of sympathetic amines and prostaglandins. Therefore, the high levels of 5-HT in the synovial fluid of patients with TMJ inflammatory pain may contribute to TMJ pain by similar mechanisms.", 
    "5": "Mitochondrial perturbation and oxidative stress are key factors in neuronal vulnerability in several neurodegenerative diseases or during brain ischemia. Here we have investigated the protective mechanism of action of guanosine, the guanine nucleoside, in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, subjected to mitochondrial oxidative stress. Blockade of mitochondrial complexes I and V with rotenone plus oligomycin (Rot/oligo) caused a significant decrease in cell viability and an increase in ROS production. Guanosine that the protective effect of guanosine incubated concomitantly with Rot/oligo abolished Rot/oligo-induced cell death and ROS production in a concentration dependent manner; maximum protection was achieved at the concentration of 1mM. The cytoprotective effect afforded by guanosine was abolished by adenosine A(1) or A(2A) receptor antagonists (DPCPX or ZM241385, respectively), or by a large (big) conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel (BK) blocker (charybdotoxin). Evaluation of signaling pathways showed that the protective effect of guanosine was not abolished by a MEK inhibitor (PD98059), by a p38(MAPK) inhibitor (SB203580), or by a PKC inhibitor (cheleritrine). However, when blocking the PI3K/Akt pathway with LY294002, the neuroprotective effect of guanosine was abolished. Guanosine increased Akt and p-Ser-9-GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation confirming this pathway plays a key role in guanosine's neuroprotective effect. Guanosine induced the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. The protective effects of guanosine were prevented by heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor, SnPP. Moreover, bilirubin, an antioxidant and physiologic product of HO-1, is protective against mitochondrial oxidative stress. In conclusion, our results show that guanosine can afford protection against mitochondrial oxidative stress by a signaling pathway that implicates PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 proteins and induction of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1.", 
    "6": "The fate of the three environmentally relevant \u03b2-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propranolol has been studied in batch experiments involving aquifer material and nitrate reducing conditions. Results from the about 90 d long tests indicate that abiotic processes, most likely sorption, jointly with biotransformation to atenololic acid were responsible for the 65% overall removal observed for atenolol. Zero order kinetics, typical of enzyme-limited reactions, controlled the transformation of this beta blocker to its corresponding carboxylic acid. The mass balance evidences that no mineralization of atenolol occurs in the biotic experiment and that atenololic acid is more stable than its parent compound under the studied conditions. This finding stresses the importance of considering atenololic acid as target compound in the environmental studies on the fate of atenolol. For metoprolol and propranolol the results from the experiment suggest a slower sorption to be the dominant removal process, which led to final decreases in concentrations of 25-30% and 40-45%, respectively. Overall, the removals observed in the experiments suggest that subsurface processes potentially constitute an alternative water treatment for the target beta-blockers, when compared to the removals reported for conventional wastewater treatment plants.", 
    "7": "We report a 9-month-old boy with bilateral pseudoptosis associated with elevated IOP. The patient had previously undergone bilateral trabeculectomies and Ahmed tube placement and right cataract extraction and penetrating keratoplasty. At presentation, the right eye IOP was 24 mm Hg and the left eye IOP was 32 mm Hg. Approximately 2 weeks after dorzolamide was added to the treatment regimen for the left eye, the mother reported that the ptosis had resolved. We suggest several explanations for the resolution of the ptosis.", 
    "8": "Noninvasive measurement of hemodynamic parameter was undertaken in 240 patients with untreated primary hypertension using impedance cardiography (ICG) in outpatient clinics. High output was defined as a cardiac index (CI) >3.6 L/minute/m(2) and high resistance was defined as the total peripheral resistance index (TPRI) >2700 dyne\u00b7s\u00b7m(2)/cm(5). Of all patients, 67% had high-resistance hypertension (high TPRI with normal or low CI), and 16% had high-output hypertension (high CI with normal TPRI). Treatment with \u03b2-blockers for high-output hypertension and with calcium channel blockers for high-resistance hypertension reduced blood pressure equally, and restored normal hemodynamic balance, as reported in studies using invasive monitoring methods. These findings suggest that it is appropriate to use noninvasive ICG measurements to guide antihypertensive therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that female gender, tachycardia, and low body mass index (BMI) were associated with high-output hypertension, but age was not. Heterogeneity of hemodynamic parameters is thought to be one of the reasons why the efficacies of antihypertensive agents differ between patients. It may be feasible to predict which antihypertensive agent would be the most effective for a particular patient based on hemodynamic measurements or combination of gender, heart rate, and BMI.", 
    "9": "Data on the prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) are limited. This study aimed to examine the above factors in a cohort of predialysis patients.", 
    "10": "During a period of 4 months, we recorded information on blood pressure (BP), comorbidities, medications and related parameters of patients followed up in the Low-Clearance Clinic of our Department. Control rates of hypertension were calculated at two thresholds: <130/80 and <140/90 mm Hg. Univariate and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to assess factors associated with BP control.", 
    "11": "In the population studied [n = 238, males 58.4%, age 66.21 \u00b1 4.2 years (mean \u00b1 SD), estimated glomerular filtration rate 14.5 \u00b1 4.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2)], the prevalence of hypertension was 95.0%. Treatment rate among hypertensives was at 99.1%. On average, 3.04 \u00b1 1.32 antihypertensive drugs were used, ranging from 1 to 7 agents. BP control rates at the <130/80 and <140/90 mm Hg thresholds were 26.5% and 48.2%, respectively. The systolic goal was achieved in 31.0% and 50.4%, whereas the diastolic goal was achieved in 67.7% and 91.2% of patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, only black race was independently and inversely related with hypertension control (\u03b2 = -0.187, p = 0.030). No specific antihypertensive class showed independent associations with control.", 
    "12": "Hypertension is highly prevalent in predialysis CKD patients. An almost universal treatment, employing a multi-agent regime, can help towards improved rates of control. Systolic BP is the main barrier to successful control and black race is associated with poorer control rates.", 
    "13": "In this paper, twelve dialkyltartrate-boric acid complexes and two polyols-boric acid complexes were in situ synthesized by the reaction of different dialkyltartrates or polyols with boric acid in methanol containing triethylamine. All of the twelve dialkyltartrate-boric acid complexes were found to have relatively good chiral separation performance in nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis (NACE). Their chiral recognition effects in terms of both enantioselectivity (\u03b1) and resolution (R(s)) were similar when the number of carbon atoms was below six in the alkyl group of alcohol moiety. The dialkyltartrates containing alkyl groups of different structures but the same number of carbon atoms, i.e. one of straight chain and one of branched chain, also provided similar chiral recognition effects. Furthermore, it was demonstrated for the first time that two methanol insoluble polyols, D-mannitol and D-sorbitol, could react with boric acid to prepare chiral ion-pair selectors using methanol as the solvent medium.", 
    "14": "Beta blockers are a fundamental treatment in chronic heart failure (HF), yet concern and disagreement regarding their role in the treatment of decompensated HF and during hospitalization are common in clinical practice. This review summarizes the literature on various aspects of beta blocker treatment during acute and chronic decompensated HF. In recent years evidence has accumulated concerning the efficacy and tolerability of beta blockers in decompensated HF. Clinical analyses show that withdrawal of chronic beta blockade should be avoided when possible during hospitalization and that beta blockertherapy be initiated as soon as hemodynamic stability and a euvolemic state are achieved. This strategy may increase adherence to beta blockers after discharge and lower rehospitalization and mortality rates. We also discuss the various positive inotrope regimens (phosphodiesterase inhibitors, levosimendan, dobutamine) and their interactions with beta blockers in decompensated HF.", 
    "15": "The CYP2D family members are instrumental in the metabolism of 20-25% of commonly prescribed drugs. Although many CYP2D isoforms have been well characterized in other animal models, research concerning the chicken CYP2Ds is limited. In this study, a cDNA encoding a novel CYP2D enzyme (CYP2D49) was cloned from the chicken liver for the first time. The CYP2D49 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 502 amino acids that shared 52%-57% identities with other CYP2Ds. The gene structure and neighboring genes of CYP2D49 are conserved and similar to those of human CYP2D6. Additionally, similar to human CYP2D6, CYP2D49 is un-inducible in the liver and expressed predominantly in the liver, kidney and small intestine, with detectable levels in several other tissues. Metabolic assays of the CYP2D49 protein heterologously expressed in E. coli and Hela cells indicated that CYP2D49 metabolized the human CYP2D6 substrate, bufuralol, but not debrisoquine. Moreover, quinidine, a potent inhibitor of human CYP2D6, only inhibited the bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation activity of CYP2D49 to a negligible degree. All these results indicated that CYP2D49 had functional characteristics similar to those of human CYP2D6 but measurably differed in the debrisoquine 4'-hydroxylation and quinidine inhibitory profile. Further structure-function investigations that employed site-directed mutagenesis and circular dichroism spectroscopy identified the importance of Val-126, Glu-222, Asp-306, Phe-486 and Phe-488 in keeping the enzymatic activity of CYP2D49 toward bufuralol as well as the importance of Asp-306, Phe-486 and Phe-488 in maintaining the conformation of CYP2D49 protein. The current study is only the first step in characterizing the metabolic mechanism of CYP2D49; further studies are still required.", 
    "16": "Nebivolol is a \u03b2(1)-adrenergic blocker that also elicits renal vasodilation and increases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, its direct actions on the renal microvasculature and vasodilator mechanism have not been established. We used the in vitro blood-perfused juxtamedullary nephron technique to determine the vasodilator effects of nebivolol and to test the hypothesis that nebivolol induces vasodilation of renal afferent arterioles via an nitric oxide synthase (NOS)/nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)/cGMP pathway and the afferent arteriolar vasodilation effect may be mediated through the release of NO by activation of NOS via a \u03b2(3)-adrenoceptor-dependent mechanism. Juxtamedullary nephrons were superfused with nebivolol either alone or combined with the sGC inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) or the NOS inhibitor N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine (l-NNA) or the \u03b2-blockers metoprolol (\u03b2(1)), butoxamine (\u03b2(2)), and SR59230A (\u03b2(3)). Nebivolol (100 \u03bcmol/l) markedly increased afferent and efferent arteriolar diameters by 18.9 \u00b1 3.0 and 15.8 \u00b1 1.8%. Pretreatment with l-NNA (1,000 \u03bcmol/l) or ODQ (10 \u03bcmol/l) decreased afferent vasodilator diameters and prevented the vasodilator effects of nebivolol (2.0 \u00b1 0.2 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.6%). Metoprolol did not elicit significant changes in afferent vasodilator diameters and did not prevent the effects of nebivolol to vasodilate afferent arterioles. However, treatment with SR59230A, but not butoxamine, markedly attenuated the vasodilation responses to nebivolol. Using a monoclonal antibody to \u03b2(3)-receptors revealed predominant immunostaining on vascular and glomerular endothelial cells. These data indicate that nebivolol vasodilates both afferent and efferent arterioles and that the afferent vasodilator effect is via a mechanism that is independent of \u03b2(1)-receptors but is predominantly mediated via a NOS/NO/sGC/cGMP-dependent mechanisms initiated by activation of endothelial \u03b2(3)-receptors.", 
    "17": "This review will discuss the most recent developments in pharmacogenetics of commonly used perioperative medications, new collaboration networks in the field of personalized medicine, and future clinical implications of pharmacogenetics.", 
    "18": "Evidence now suggests that pharmacogenetics has a role in the effects of analgesic, sedative, beta-blocker, local anesthetic, antiemetic, and obstetric medications. Variants in the \u03bc opioid receptor gene change the analgesic effects of morphine. Additional opioids recently studied include remifentanil, methadone, tramadol, and codeine. Ibuprofen's clearance varies with CYP2C9*3 genotype. Midazolam is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4/CYP3A5 enzymes. Enzyme induction was found to be about 50% greater with CYP3A5*3 homozygous genotype. Variations in minimum alveolar concentrations of volatile anesthetics and subcutaneous lidocaine efficacy have been attributed in part to melanocortin-1 receptor variants. Metoprolol achieved different effects in patients with CYP2D6 and beta1-receptor polymorphisms. Genetic background of the beta2-receptor contributes to susceptibility for experiencing preterm labor. The Pharmacogenomics Research Network and the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium are partnerships of researchers who are dedicated to elucidating how the genome contributes to an individual patient's medication responses.",

However, it is potentially cardiotoxic. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs) and/or \u03b2-blockers and development of heart failure (HF) and/or left ventricular dysfunction during 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy.", 
    "21": "A total of 499 women receiving adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for EBC entered in a multicenter registry and were divided into four subgroups according to treatment with ACEi/ARBs and/or \u03b2-blockers. Occurrence of HF and decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; minimum 10 percentage points) were recorded.", 
    "22": "HF occurred in 2% of patients who did not take either ACEi/ARBs or \u03b2-blockers, 8% of patients receiving ACEi/ARBs alone, 8% receiving \u03b2-blockers alone (p = .03), and 19% receiving both medications (p < .01). The prevalence of patients with LVEF that decreased by at least 10 percentage points was similar in all groups. Combined ACEi/ARBs and \u03b2-blocker therapy was independently associated with hypertension and a significant reduction of LVEF from baseline to 3-month evaluation. The use of ACEi/ARBs alone or \u03b2-blockers alone was predicted only by hypertension. Combined therapy of ACEi/ARBs plus \u03b2-blockers predicted LVEF recovery from the 3-month to 12-month evaluation.", 
    "23": "In clinical practice, the degree of hypertension and decrease in LVEF during the first 3 months of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for EBC are associated with the use of ACEi/ARBs and \u03b2-blockers. The combined use of these two medications is associated with a recovery of LVEF during months 3-12 of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy.",

The levamlodipine-induced tachycardia and the bisoprolol-induced bradycardia were temporized by the combination of these two drugs. Upon chronic treatment, this combination also decreased blood pressure variability and reduced organ damage.",

    "28": "The influence of ionising radiation on physico-chemical properties of metoprolol tartrate (MT) in solid phase was studied. The compound was irradiated by radiation produced by a beam of high-energy electrons in an accelerator, in doses from 25 to 400 kGy, and the possible changes in the samples were detected by organoleptic analysis (colour, forms, clarity), chromatographic and spectrometric methods. Already at the standard sterilisation dose of 25 kGy, the presence of free radicals (0.3764 \u00d7 10(16) spin/g) and a decrease in the melting point by 1\u00b0C were noted. At higher doses of irradiation products of radiolysis appeared (100 kGy) and the colour was changed from white to pale cream (200 kGy). Our observation was that with increasing mass loss of MT after irradiation with 100, 200 and 400 kGy, the concentration of free radicals increased from 1.0330 to 1.6869 \u00d7 10(16) spin/g. The radiolytic yield of total radiolysis was 4.54 \u00d7 10(7) mol/J for 100 kGy, 7.42 \u00d7 10(7) mol/J for 200 kGy and 4.74 \u00d7 10(7) mol/J for 400 kGy. No significant changes were observed in the character of FT-IR spectra, but in UV an increase in intensity of the band at the analytical wavelength was noted. As follows from the results MT shows high radiochemical stability for the typical sterilisation doses 25-50 kGy, and will probably be able to be sterilised by radiation in the dose of 25 kGy.", 
    "29": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is common in patients with diabetes. Reasons for this are multifactorial, but all relate to a variety of maladaptive responses to acute hyperglycemia. Persistent hyperglycemia is associated with worse left ventricular function and higher mortality during AMI, but intervention data are far from clear. Although there is a theoretical basis for the use of glucose-insulin-potassium infusion during AMI, lack of outcome efficacy (and inability to reach glycemic targets) in recent randomized trials has resulted in little enthusiasm for this strategy. Based on the increasing understanding of the dangers of hypoglycemia, while at the same time appreciating the role of hyperglycemia in AMI patients, goal glucose levels of 140-180 mg/dL using an intravenous insulin infusion while not eating seem reasonable for most patients and hospital systems. Non-glycemic therapy for patients with diabetes and AMI has benefited from more conclusive data, as this population has greater morbidity and mortality than those without diabetes. For ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), reperfusion therapy with primary percutaneous coronary intervention or fibrinolysis, antithrombotic therapy to prevent acute stent thrombosis following percutaneous coronary intervention or rethrombosis following thrombolysis, and initiation of \u03b2-blocker therapy are the current standard of care. Emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery is reserved for the most critically ill. For those with non-STEMI, initial reperfusion therapy or fibrinolysis is not routinely indicated. Overall, there have been dramatic advances for the treatment of people with AMI and diabetes. The use of continuous glucose monitoring in this population may allow better ability to safely reach glycemic targets, which it is hoped will improve glycemic control.",

Both patients suffered from diabetes type 1 and 2, respectively, complicated by diabetic nephropathy, renal hypertension and retinopathy. The first woman had received an AT1 receptor antagonist and a beta blocker, the other one an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker. At initial clinical examination both patients were in a good general state of health. Respiration, pulse and blood pressure were within normal limits.",

At post partum examination renal failure was confirmed in both infants. The first infant, now a boy at the age of two years, still suffers from chronic renal failure, needing antihypertensive medication with an ACE blocker. Follow-up of the second baby has so far shown normal growth of the kidneys and normotensive blood pressure.", 
    "33": "When planning a pregnancy, a preexisting hypertension should be treated with either methyldopa (1st choice) or a beta blocker as a second choice (e. g. Metoprolol).

Limited data have been reported about the occurrence of myocardial damage associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Therefore, our purpose was to investigate the incidence, predictors, and prognostic value of myocardial injury during TAVI.", 
    "35": "We studied 119 patients (aged 81\u00b18 years; 47 male) who had undergone a TAVI with the Medtronic-CoreValve bioprosthesis. Serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels were measured before and after the procedure. Myocardial injury was defined as a postprocedural increase of CK-MB and/or cTnT level >5 times the upper reference limit. After TAVI, the incidence of myocardial injury was 17%, which was independently predicted by procedural duration (in minutes) (odds ratio [OR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06), preprocedural \u03b2-blocker use (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.45), peripheral arterial disease (OR, 6.36; 95% CI, 1.56-25.87), and prosthesis depth (in millimeters) (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.59). The 30-day mortality after TAVI was 13% and was independently predicted by myocardial injury (OR, 8.54; 95% CI, 2.17-33.52), preprocedural hospitalization (OR, 9.36; 95% CI, 2.55-34.38), and left ventricular mass index (in g/m(2)) (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03).",

A longer procedural duration, the absence of \u03b2-blocker use, peripheral arterial disease, and a deeper prosthesis insertion are associated with myocardial injury. Together with preprocedural hospitalization and left ventricular mass, myocardial injury is an independent predictor for 30-day mortality after TAVI.", 
    "37": "Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a rare variant of HCM in the non-Japanese population (1% to 2%). Diagnostic dilemma occurs when this type of HCM is newly discovered in a patient previously diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) secondary to hypertension. We describe an atypical presentation of an apical HCM in the setting of chronic hypertension (HTN) and review the literature of this rare variant of HCM. Our patient presented with chest pain and was found to have apical HCM with inducible apical ischemia and an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise. Multimodality imaging approach is proposed to evaluate the LVH when both apical HCM and hypertension are present given the impact of an accurate diagnosis on prognosis and management.", 
    "38": "Recently it has been demonstrated that catecholamines are produced and used by macrophages and mediate immune response. The aim of this study is to verify whether endothelial cells (ECs), which are of myeloid origin, can produce catecholamines. We demonstrated that genes coding for tyrosine hydroxylase, Dopa decarboxylase, dopamine \u03b2 hydroxylase (D\u03b2H), and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase, enzymes involved in the synthesis of catecholamines, are all expressed in basal conditions in bovine aorta ECs, and their expression is enhanced in response to hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia enhances catecholamine release. To evaluate the signal transduction pathway that regulates catecholamine synthesis in ECs, we overexpressed in bovine aorta ECs either protein kinase A (PKA) or the transcription factor cAMP response element binding, because PKA/cAMP response element binding activation induces tyrosine hydroxylase transcription and activity in response to stress. Both cAMP response element binding and PKA overexpression enhance D\u03b2H and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase gene expression and catecholamine release, whereas H89, inhibitor of PKA, exerts the opposite effect, evidencing the role of PKA/cAMP response element binding transduction pathway in the regulation of catecholamine release in bovine aorta ECs. We then evaluated by immunohistochemistry the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, Dopa decarboxylase, D\u03b2H, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase in femoral arteries from hindlimbs of C57Bl/6 mice 3 days after removal of the common femoral artery to induce chronic ischemia. Ischemia evokes tyrosine hydroxylase, Dopa decarboxylase, D\u03b2H, and phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase expression in the endothelium. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of catecholamine release by fusaric acid, an inhibitor of D\u03b2H, reduces the ability of ECs to form network-like structures on Matrigel matrix. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that ECs are able to synthesize and release catecholamines in response to ischemia.", 
    "39": "Hypertension (HTN) is an increasingly important medical and public health problem. In Bangladesh, approximately 20% of adult and 40-65% of elderly people suffer from HTN. High incidence of metabolic syndrome, and lifestyle-related factors like obesity, high salt intake, and less physical activity may play important role in the pathophysiology of HTN. The association of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphism and low birth weight with blood pressure has been studied inadequately. Studies have found relationship between mass arsenic poisoning and HTN. Hypovitaminosis D presumably plays role in the aetiopathogenesis of HTN in Bangladeshi population. South Asians appear to respond to antihypertensive therapy in a similar manner to the Whites. The latest National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guideline advocates a calcium-channel blocker as step 1 antihypertensive treatment to people aged > 55 years and an ACE inhibitor or a low-cost angiotensin-II receptor blocker for the younger people. Calcium-channel blockers and beta-blockers have been found to be the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs in Bangladesh. Non-adherence to the standard guidelines and irrational drug prescribing are likely to be important. On the other hand, non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment is quite high. At the advent of the new millennium, we are really unaware of our real situation. Large-scale, preferably, nation-wide survey and clinical research are needed to explore the different aspects of HTN in Bangladesh.",

Here, we examined the contribution fear conditioning may play in altering an animals' behavior in a repeated stress paradigm. Fischer rats were exposed daily to different stressors in a complex environment (context A). After four days of stressor exposure, exploratory behavior (10 min in new cage) and social interaction (5 min with juvenile) were tested on day 5 in either the same environment or a new environment (context B). Rats showed decreased exploration and social interaction when tested in context A compared to control rats or rats tested in context B. Additionally, chronic infusion of propranolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that crosses the blood-brain barrier), but not nadolol (beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier), prevented the behavioral changes following repeated stressor exposure. Propranolol treatment did not affect the acute or chronic elevation of corticosterone, the decrease in body weight gain, or adrenal hypertrophy observed in animals exposed to stress. These data demonstrate that conditioned fear responses can contribute to behavioral changes in a repeated stress paradigm. Additional studies revealed, Sprague-Dawley rats do not demonstrate decreased exploration or social interaction when testing occurs in the same context as repeated stressor exposure suggesting Fischer rats may have a greater propensity to associate distal cues with aversive events in a complex environment. This may be due to greater stress responses in Fischer animals that are known to enhance consolidation of emotionally arousing events.", 
    "41": "\u03b2-blockers are effective antihypertensive agents and, together with diuretics, have been the cornerstone of pioneering studies showing their benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as a consequence of blood pressure reduction in patients with hypertension. However, evidence from recent meta-analyses have demonstrated no benefit afforded by atenolol compared with placebo in risk of mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke, and a higher risk of mortality and stroke with atenolol/propranolol compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. Thus, the effect of these agents on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients, especially their use in uncomplicated hypertension, has remained largely controversial. However, it is recognized that the clinical studies used in these meta-analyses were mainly based on the older second-generation \u03b2-blockers, such as atenolol and metoprolol. Actually, considerable heterogeneity in, eg, pharmacokinetic, pharmacological, and physicochemical properties exists across the different classes of \u03b2-blockers, particularly between the second-generation and newer third-generation agents. Carvedilol is a vasodilating noncardioselective third-generation \u03b2-blocker, without the negative hemodynamic and metabolic effects of traditional \u03b2-blockers, which can be used as a cardioprotective agent. Compared with conventional \u03b2-blockers, carvedilol maintains cardiac output, has a reduced prolonged effect on heart rate, and reduces blood pressure by decreasing vascular resistance. Studies have also shown that carvedilol exhibits favorable effects on metabolic parameters, eg, glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that it could be considered in the treatment of patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes. The present report provides an overview of the main clinical studies concerning carvedilol administered as either monotherapy or in combination with another antihypertensive or more frequently a diuretic agent, with particular focus on the additional benefits beyond blood pressure reduction.", 
    "42": "Hypertension is a common disorder linked to increases in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Effective treatment decreases this excess mortality. Therapy with a single antihypertensive agent fails to achieve blood pressure goals in up to 75 % of patients. Compared to monotherapy, combination antihypertensive therapy, especially with fixed-dose (single pill) formulations, may more effectively control blood pressure and improve medication persistence while decreasing adverse effects, healthcare costs, and physician therapeutic inertia. Certain combinations, such as a calcium channel blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, have been associated with similar or fewer adverse effects and better outcomes than other combinations. In contrast, other combinations such as thiazide diuretics and \u03b2-blockers may cause more adverse effects than monotherapy. When choosing a thiazide diuretic, chlorthalidone is preferable to hydrochlorothiazide, given better efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes. Initial combination antihypertensive therapy may benefit patients with stage I or II hypertension and more widespread use should be encouraged.", 
    "43": "It is important to establish effective treatment for postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common complication after cardiac surgery. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of landiolol hydrochloride for rhythm conversion in patients with postoperative AF. Among 134 patients who developed new-onset AF after open heart surgery between 2007 and 2009, 69 patients who received landiolol hydrochloride for treatment of postoperative AF were enrolled. The AF conversion rate, the percentage of patients with 20 % reduction of the ventricular rate, and the factors related to successful treatment were evaluated. Then, the landiolol group was compared with 65 patients who had postoperative AF and did not receive landiolol hydrochloride. Landiolol hydrochloride was the first-line treatment in 46 patients and the only therapy in 26 patients. Reversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 51 patients, while the conversion rate in patients without landiolol hydrochloride was only 56.8 % (p < 0.05). A 20 % reduction of the ventricular rate was achieved more frequently in the landiolol group. Although landiolol hydrochloride was highly effective in patients who had undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, patients with cardiopulmonary bypass did not respond as well. The heart rate was reduced from 130 \u00b1 26 to 81 \u00b1 12 (p < 0.05) after landiolol administration, while blood pressure did not decrease significantly. Landiolol hydrochloride was effective for conversion of postoperative AF. This ultra-short-acting \u03b2-blocker is a safe first-line treatment for postoperative AF after open heart surgery, and is most effective in patients who have undergone off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.",

Myocardial changes, as a result of the lack of dystrophin, consist of cell membrane degradation, interstitial inflammation, fatty replacement and fibrosis. Dystrophinopathic cardiomyopathy generally starts as a preclinical or intermediate stage, with evolution toward advanced stages characterized by ventricle enlargement but also by symptoms and signs of heart failure (dyspnoea, peripheral edema and liver enlargement). However in few patients the dilation could be the first manifestation of the heart involvement. The ability to detect overt cardiomyopathy increases with age, such that more than 80% of boys older than 18 years will have abnormal systolic function.

Morphine-withdrawn rats showed an increase of NA turnover and COMT expression in parallel with an enhancement of adrenocorticotropin and plasma corticosterone concentrations. In addition, we observed an enhancement of Hsp27 expression and phosphorylation. Pretreatment with SL327 or propranolol significantly reduced morphine withdrawal-induced increases of plasma adrenocorticotropin and Hsp27 phosphorylation at Ser82 without any changes in plasma corticosterone levels. The present findings demonstrate that morphine withdrawal is capable of inducing the activation of HPA axis in parallel with an enhancement of Hsp27 expression and Hsp27 phosphorylation at Ser82 and suggest a role for \u03b2-adrenoceptors and ERK pathways in mediating morphine-withdrawal activation of the HPA axis and cellular stress response.",

In two parallel studies, relaxation of isolated human bladder strips was tested for the \u03b2-AR agonists isoproterenol, clenbuterol, BRL 37344, and KUC-7322. For the isoproterenol and KUC-7322 responses, antagonism by CGP 20712A, ICI 118551, and SR59230A was determined. The potency and efficacy of the reference agonists for detrusor relaxation was in line with their known \u03b23-AR activity. KUC-7322 relative to isoproterenol was a full agonist with a pEC(50) of 5.95 \u00b1 0.09 and 5.92 \u00b1 0.11 in the two studies. SR59230A exhibited antagonism of the expected potency against isoproterenol (apparent pK (B) 7.2) but not against KUC-7322. Neither isoproterenol nor KUC-7322 nor forskolin significantly attenuated CCh-induced contraction. These results suggest that KUC-7322 displays full agonistic activity in relaxing the human detrusor without inhibiting the contraction induced by cholinergic stimulation.

Treatment for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia includes medical and surgical efforts to suppress the effects of epinephrine at the myocardial level and/or modulation of calcium homeostasis. Mortality is high when untreated and sudden cardiac death may be the first manifestation of the disease. First-degree relatives of a proband should be offered genetic testing if the causal mutation is known.

In this review we describe pathophysiological considerations that may help in elucidating the potential role of beta (\u03b2)-adrenergic antagonists to block some of the adverse sympathetic effects in acute brain injury (subarachnoid hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. In acute brain injury cardiac dysfunction has been studied most extensively but its pathophysiology is only partly elucidated in man. Further, several adverse consequences of sympathetic activation on the brain itself may occur. Clinical and preclinical studies are described in this review that lend support to the idea that \u03b2 blockers may have beneficial effects on both cardiac, cerebral and other adverse consequences of sympathetic overactivation after acute brain injury. Second, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may also respond to \u03b2 blocker therapy, albeit through a different mechanism than in acute brain injury. Some studies reported on beneficial effects of these drugs on ARDS through the mitigation of pulmonary blood flow, without a decrease in systemic hemodynamics. However, in both acute brain injury and ARDS further studies are needed to distinguish those patients who are most likely to benefit from \u03b2 blockers from those more likely to be harmed by them.

The largest rise is observed for angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), which were only sporadically prescribed in 1997 and now account for 10.5% of the delivered antihypertensive drugs. A small rise is also noted for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) (12.3% in 1997 vs 15.6% in 2009). Their success comes at the expense of calcium antagonists, of which the delivered amount declined from 19.8% in 1997 tot 14.1% in 2009. A progressive rise in the prescription of fixed combination products is observed (from 15% in 1997 to 21% in 2009), and can probably be attributed to their growing availability but also to the recent guidelines, promoting their usage.",

It is important to establish the diagnosis when it occurs to differentiate this benign phenomenon from dangerous ventricular tachycardia. We present the case of a healthy child who developed episodes of AIVR associated with propranolol treatment. Her 24-hour electrocardiography recording showed AIVR with difference between sinus and ventricular beats. The arrhythmia resolved with the discontinuation of propranolol, and eventually the case was in sinus rhythm. This patient is the first case of AIVR associated with propranolol treatment in the literature.", 
    "91": "Molecularly imprinted nanomaterials are gaining substantial importance. As a simple and efficient synthetic method, precipitation polymerization has been used to prepare uniform molecularly imprinted microspheres for numerous template compounds. Despite of its general applicability, the difficulty of obtaining uniform particles for some difficult templates by precipitation polymerization has been reported. In this work, we attempted to produce uniform atrazine-imprinted nanoparticles using propranolol as an auxiliary template under standard precipitation polymerization condition. When propranolol was added in the prepolymerization mixture for atrazine imprinting, it displayed a significant effect on particle size and size distribution of atrazine-imprinted polymers. The molecular binding characteristics of the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles were found to be dependent on the relative ratios of the two templates. Under an optimal template propranolol-atrazine ratio of 1:3 mol/mol, very uniform imprinted nanoparticles (d(H) \u2009=\u2009106\u2009nm) with a polydispersity index of 0.07 were obtained. The loading of the auxiliary template (propranolol) could be reduced to as low as 5% without sacrificing the uniformity of the MIP nanoparticles. The uniform MIP nanoparticles could be easily encapsulated into polyethylene terephthalate nanofibers using a simple electrospinning technique. The composite nanofibers containing the MIP nanoparticles maintained specific molecular binding capability for both atrazine and propranolol.", 
    "92": "We tested a hypothesis that an enhancement of I(Ks) may play a pivotal role in ventricular proarrhythmia under high sympathetic activity. A 2-dimensional ventricular muscle layer was prepared in rabbit hearts, and action potential signals were analyzed by optical mapping. During constant stimulation, isoproterenol (ISP, 0.1 \u00b5M) significantly shortened action potential duration (APD); chromanol 293B (30 \u00b5M), a selective I(Ks)-blocker, reversed the APD shortening. VTs induced in the presence of ISP lasted longer than in the control, and this was reversed by 293B. E-4031 (0.1 \u00b5M), a selective I(Kr)-blocker, did not cause such reversal. Spiral-wave (SW) reentry with ISP was characterized by more stable rotation around a shorter functional block line (FBL) than in the control. After application of 293B, SW reentry was destabilized, and rotation around a longer FBL with prominent drift reappeared. The APD abbreviation by ISP close to the rotation center was more pronounced than in the periphery, leading to an opposite APD gradient (center < periphery) compared with controls. This effect was also reversed by 293B. In conclusion, \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation stabilizes SW reentry most likely though an enhancement of I(Ks). Blockade of I(Ks) may be a promising therapeutic modality in prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias under high sympathetic activity.", 
    "93": "A moderate drug permeating rate (flux) is desirable for long-acting transdermal patches. In this work, a novel simple method of controlling bisoprolol (BSP) flux by ion-pair strategy was initiated. Different ion-pair complexes including bisoprolol maleate (BSP-M), bisoprolol tartarate, bisoprolol besilate, and bisoprolol fumarate were prepared and their fluxes through rabbit abdominal skin were determined separately in vitro. Furthermore, permeation behavior from isopropyl myristate, solubility index in pressure-sensitive adhesives, determined by DSC, and n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) were investigated to illustrate the mechanism of drug permeation rate controlling. The results showed that compared to free BSP (J = 25.98 \u00b1 2.34 \u03bcg/cm(2)/h), all BSP ion-pair complexes displayed lower and controllable flux in the range of 0.11 to 4.19 \u03bcg/cm(2)/h. After forming ion-pair complexes, the capability of BSP to penetrate through skin was weakened due to the lowered log P and increased molecule weight. Accordingly, this study has demonstrated that the flux of BSP could be controlled by ion-pair strategy, and among all complexes investigated, BSP-M was the most promising candidate for long-acting transdermal patches.",

Compared to traditional beta-adrenergic antagonists, beta-blockers of the new generation exhibit ancillary properties such as vasodilation through different mechanisms. This translates into a more favorable hemodynamic profile. The relative affinities of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists towards the three beta-adrenoreceptor isotypes matter for predicting their functional impact on vasomotor control. This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying beta-blocker-evoked vasorelaxation with a specific emphasis on agonist properties of beta(3)-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "95": "Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C) is involved in the regulation of cardiac myofilament contraction. Recent evidence showed that protein kinase D (PKD) is one of the kinases that phosphorylate cMyBP-C. However, the mechanism by which PKD-induced cMyBP-C phosphorylation affects cardiac contractile responses is not known. Using immunoprecipitation, we showed that, in contracting cardiomyocytes, PKD binds to cMyBP-C and phosphorylates it at Ser(315). The effect of PKD-mediated phosphorylation of cMyBP-C on cardiac myofilament function was investigated in permeabilized ventricular myocytes, isolated from wild-type (WT) and from cMyBP-C knockout (KO) mice, incubated in the presence of full-length active PKD. In WT myocytes, PKD increased both myofilament Ca(2+) sensitivity (pCa(50)) and maximal Ca(2+)-activated tension of contraction (T(max)). In cMyBP-C KO skinned myocytes, PKD increased pCa(50) but did not alter T(max). This suggests that cMyBP-C is not involved in PKD-mediated sensitization of myofilaments to Ca(2+) but is essential for PKD-induced increase in T(max). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of both PKD-Ser(916) and cMyBP-C-Ser(315) was contraction frequency-dependent, suggesting that PKD-mediated cMyBP-C phosphorylation is operational primarily during periods of increased contractile activity. Thus, during high contraction frequency, PKD facilitates contraction of cardiomyocytes by increasing Ca(2+) sensitivity and by an increased T(max) through phosphorylation of cMyBP-C.",

Destructive thyrotoxicosis appeared after four months of continuous IFN-\u03b1 therapy and a beta blocker was prescribed. Initially, the patient presented normal TSH 2.4 \u00b5IU/mL, however during therapy with INF-\u03b1, TSH diminished to 0.05 and thyroid hormones were elevated: fT4 23.1 pmol/L, fT3 7.2 pmol/L. Ultrasound examination showed completely irregular and greatly decreased echogenicity of the thyroid gland. The radioiodine uptake (RAIU) was deeply decreased to 2 and 3% at 5 h and 24 h, respectively. The thyroid scintiscan showed lack of isotope accumulation. Hypothyroidism developed and L-thyroxine was prescribed. The following year, hyperthyroidism reoccurred with TSH 0.08\u2009\u00b5IU/mL, fT4 26.4 pmol/L, fT3 8.2 pmol/L, positive TSHR-Abs 6.2 (normal <2 IU/L) and mild Graves' Ophthalmopathy (GO). RAIU values were 23% at 5 h and 46% at 24 h. Thyroid scintiscan showed diffuse goiter. At this point beta blocker was introduced and ATD was started. After three months of therapy an increased level of aminotransferases and granulocytopaenia were observed. Hence, the patient received RAI and glucocorticosteroid, while INF-\u03b1 therapy was continued. After approximately 4 months, hypothyroidism reappeared with insignificantly raised TSH level. One year later the patient was euthyroid and required no further treatment.",

    "99": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare abnormality of the neuroendocrine system that affects 2% of children. It is a frequently missed diagnosis in the emergency department and may require a number of emergency department visits before the diagnosis is made. The objectives of this review are to identify the clinical features that suggest a diagnosis of CVS and to review the literature on its management. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched from January 1948 to October 2011 using the keywords 'Cyclic' or 'Vomiting'. Papers were excluded if they did not follow the consensus guidelines or if they were case reports. This review analysed 1093 cases of cyclic vomiting in 25 papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All except one paper were retrospective studies. The size of these cohort studies ranged from three to 181 patients, with a mean patient size of 29. This review found that over 40% of patients have headaches/migraines, with associated anxiety and depression in \u2248 30% of cases. There is a family history of headaches/migraines in 38.9%, and this association was much stronger in the adult CVS cohort compared with the paediatric cohort. Compared with paediatric CVS, adults have a longer duration of attacks and they occur more frequently (5.9 vs. 3.4 days, 14.4 vs. 9.6 episodes/year). Limited data are available on the treatment of the acute phase of CVS, but in adults, sumatriptan has been shown to be effective. For prophylactic treatment, tricyclics are effective in both adult and paediatric CVS, with a clinical response in 75.5 and 67.6% of patients, respectively, in nonplacebo-controlled cohort studies. Furthermore, propranolol has been shown to be useful in children. CVS is an intractable illness with a major impact on the patient's quality of life. There is a long duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of the condition. There is a high association with headaches/migraines and anxiety/depression. The symptoms are more severe in adult-onset CVS. Tricyclic antidepressants have good efficacy in reducing the frequency/duration or the intensity of attacks. There is limited evidence on the acute management of CVS.", 
    "100": "A new method significantly advantageous over the conventional spectrophotometric methods regarding simplicity, minimal data processing and applicability was developed. The new method is based on the fact that isoabsorptive points whenever present in an absorption spectrum will be retained even after division by a one component as a divisor in the ratio spectrum, in addition to a smart modification of the conventional ratio derivative and ratio subtraction methods. This modified method though simpler, enabled wider range of applications. The proposed method was applied for the analysis of brimonidine and timolol in laboratory prepared mixtures with mean percentage recoveries 100.64 \u00b1 1.10 and 100.96 \u00b1 1.16, respectively, and in their pharmaceutical formulation with mean percentage recoveries 100.88 \u00b1 0.34 and 100.84 \u00b1 0.72, respectively.

    "101": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic measures combined with low-dose propranolol or amitriptyline for treating severe pediatric migraine. Data were collected from the medical files of 118 patients (mean age, 12.54 \u00b1 3.14 years S.D.). All were treated with nonpharmacologic measures. In addition, 93 children received propranolol (mean initial dose, 0.4 \u00b1 0.17 mg/kg/day S.D.), and 25 received amitriptyline (mean initial dose, 0.26 \u00b1 0.1 mg/kg/day S.D.). Twenty patients were switched from propranolol to amitriptyline during treatment. In both groups, headache frequency was reduced by >50% per month in ~80% of patients. Patients without aura responded significantly better to propranolol than patients with aura (P = 0.02). No significant difference was evident in response to pharmacologic treatment by migraine frequency or type (episodic chronic). No significant difference was evident in response to amitriptyline between patients with or without aura. The response rate was higher than previously reported for placebo. Low-dose propranolol and low-dose amitriptyline, when combined with nonpharmacologic measures, are equally effective in reducing the frequency of migraine in children. Propranolol is preferred because of its lower risk of side effects. An additive effect of nonpharmacologic measures may allow for a reduction in drug dose.", 
    "102": "Whether treatment with \u03b2 blockers (BBs) is of benefit to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) and provocable outflow obstruction (with none or with only mild heart failure symptoms) is largely unresolved. Thus, we prospectively studied 27 patients with HC (age 36 \u00b1 15 years; 81% men) with New York Heart Association class I or II, without obstruction at rest, but with exercise-induced left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of \u2265 30 mm Hg. Patients underwent exercise echocardiography at baseline and after treatment with nadolol (n = 18; 40 to 80 mg/day) or bisoprolol (n = 9; 5 to 10 mg/day), according to a prespecified protocol. Without the BBs, the postexercise LVOT gradient was 87 \u00b1 29 mm Hg and >50 mm Hg in 25 patients (93%). After a 12 \u00b1 4-month period of BB treatment, the postexercise LVOT gradient had decreased to 36 \u00b1 22 mm Hg (p <0.001) and was virtually abolished (to 0 or <30 mm Hg) in 14 patients (52%), substantially blunted (\u2265 20 mm Hg reduction) in 9 (33%), and unchanged in only 4 (15%). Severe postexercise obstruction (range 58 to 80 mm Hg) persisted in 6 patients (22% compared to 93% without BBs; p <0.001). Nonresponders (residual postexercise gradient of \u2265 30 mm Hg with BBs) were characterized by an increased body mass index (hazard ratio 2.03/1 kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.4; p <0.05). In conclusion, in patients with HC with mild or no symptoms, treatment with BBs can prevent the development of LVOT obstruction triggered by physiologic exercise. These findings provide a rationale for the novel strategy of early prophylactic pharmacologic treatment with standard, well-tolerated doses of BBs in physically active patients with provocable gradients, aimed at effective prevention of the hemodynamic burden associated with dynamic obstruction.",

There was no evidence to indicate the existence of an anastomotic leak after examination. We were confused at first.

The current study was designed to determine whether \u03b2(1) -AA isolated from the sera of heart failure patients could cause TNF-\u03b1 secretion from the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7. Blood samples were collected from 40 patients who had suffered heart failure, as well as from 40 healthy subjects. The titer of \u03b2(1) -AA and the level of TNF-\u03b1 were detected using ELISA. The effect of \u03b2(1) -AA on murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 proliferation was detected by CCK-8 kits and CFSE assay. Western blot assay was used to analyze the expression of phospho-VASP. \u03b2(1) -AA appeared more frequently in patients with heart failure than in healthy subjects. The \u03b2(1) -AA isolated from heart failure patients promoted an increase of TNF-\u03b1 levels, which could be completely blocked by the selective \u03b2(1) -adrenergic receptor antagonist metoprolol and the second extracellular loop of \u03b2(1) -adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(1) -AR-EC(II) ), but only partially inhibited by PKA inhibitor H89. Furthermore, the \u03b2(1) -AA could enhance the proliferation of RAW264.7 cells in vitro. Meanwhile, the expression of phospho-VASP was markedly increased in the presence of \u03b2(1) -AA. These results demonstrate for the first time that the \u03b2(1) -AA isolated from heart failure patients could bind with \u03b2(1) -AR on the surface of RAW264.7 cells, causing the release of TNF-\u03b1 largely in a PKA-dependent fashion.",

    "109": "Glucose is a metabolic regulator of insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells, which is regulated by intracellular Ca(2+) signaling. We and others previously demonstrated that glucose activates CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPR-cyclase) to produce two Ca(2+) second messengers, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). Although F-actin remodeling is known to be an important step in glucose stimulated insulin secretion, the role of actin cytoskeleton in regulating Ca(2+) signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells remain to be solved. Here, we show that actin filaments are involved in the activation of CD38/ADPR-cyclase in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Glucose induces a sequential formation of cADPR and NAADP. Pretreatment with jasplakinolide, an actin polymerizing agent, or a myosin heavy chain IIA (MHCIIA) blocker, blebbistatin, inhibited glucose-induced CD38 internalization, an essential step for cADPR formation. Blocking actin disassembly with jasplakinolide also abrogates glucose-induced cADPR and NAADP formation and sustained Ca(2+) signals. These results indicate that actin filaments along with MHCIIA play an important role in CD38 internalization for the generation of Ca(2+) mobilizing messengers for glucose-induced Ca(2+) signaling in pancreatic \u03b2-cells.",

We hypothesized that genetic variation in the \u03b22-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) may influence susceptibility to bacterial meningitis. In a prospective genetic association study we genotyped 542 patients with CSF culture proven community acquired bacterial meningitis and 376 matched controls for 2 functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the \u03b22-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2). Furthermore, we analyzed if the use of non-selective beta-blockers, which bind to the \u03b22-adrenoceptor, influenced the risk of bacterial meningitis.

While several multicentre EVAR trials looked at surgical outcomes, very few have specifically investigated the effect of anaesthetic techniques or perioperative care of these patients. The purpose of this review to is to present some of the current evidence for the different aspects of perioperative management of patients undergoing EVAR. This includes surgical considerations, pre-operative assessment, and choice of anaesthetic technique as well as pharmacological protective strategies.",

    "129": "This review focuses on genetic variations in the drug metabolizing enzymes which influence the pharmacokinetics and potentially the pharmacodynamics of some \u03b2-blockers. It also reviews the polymorphisms in the adrenergic receptors (ARs) and their related pathways which are likely to influence the responses to \u03b2-blockers.", 
    "130": "The CYP2D6 genotypes influence the pharmacokinetics of some \u03b2-blockers but the effects on \u03b2-blocker responses have been inconsistent and there is currently no general role for CYP2D6 genotyping prior to choosing a particular \u03b2-blocker or dose. The common polymorphisms producing changes in the \u03b2(1)-ARs, and their signaling pathways, have been associated with clinical outcomes in several studies in hypertension and heart failure. Treatment with \u03b2-blockers, especially with higher doses, appears to have greater benefits in patients with the genetic forms of the \u03b2(1)-ARs which are more responsive to both agonists and antagonists. However, current data are not sufficiently consistent to support genotyping for these polymorphisms before selecting or initiating \u03b2-blocker treatment and further study results are needed to clarify the situation.", 
    "131": "We recently reported that acute nicotine impairs reflex tachycardic activity in estrogen-depleted, but not estrogen-repleted, female rats, suggesting a restraining influence for estrogen against the nicotine effect. In this study, we tested whether the baroreflex-protective effect of estrogen can be replicated when nicotine was administered chronically. We also report on the dose dependence and autonomic modulation of the nicotine-baroreflex interaction. The effects of nicotine (0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg/day for 14 days) on baroreflex curves relating changes in heart rate to increases [phenylephrine (PE)] or decreases [sodium nitroprusside (SNP)] in blood pressure were evaluated in sham-operated (SO), ovariectomized (OVX), and estrogen-replaced OVX (OVXE(2)) rats. Slopes of the curves were taken as a measure of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS(PE) and BRS(SNP)). In SO rats, both reflex bradycardic and tachycardic responses were attenuated by nicotine in a dose-related fashion. In nicotine-treated rats, blockade of \u03b2-adrenergic (propranolol), but not muscarinic (atropine), receptors caused additional reductions in reflex chronotropic responses, implying that nicotine selectively impairs reflex vagal activity. OVX selectively decreased BRS(PE) but not BRS(SNP) and abolished the nicotine-induced impairment of either response. These effects of OVX were reversed after treatment with estrogen or the estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene. In atropine-treated rats, comparable BRS values were demonstrated in all rat preparations regardless of the estrogen or nicotine milieu. Collectively, the inhibition of vagal activity accounts for the depressant effect of chronic nicotine on baroreflex activity. Furthermore, contrary to nicotine's acute effects, the baroreflex-attenuating effect of chronic nicotine is exacerbated by estrogen.", 
    "132": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common complication after cardiac surgery, despite improvements in anesthesia, surgical techniques, and medical therapies. Although beta-blockers have been proven to be effective, the incidence of POAF is around 20 % even with these agents. The mechanism of POAF is not fully elucidated and no optimal strategy has been established for POAF. There are two important elements of \"structural\" and \"electrical\" remodelling of the atrium in the mechanism of POAF. A patient's age and preoperative left atrial fibrosis can predict POAF associated with structural remodelling. Although inflammation and oxidative stress during cardiac surgery may be the underlying mechanisms for electrical remodelling causing POAF, there are no reliable clinical parameters for their detection. Nonetheless, postoperative P-wave dispersion and electromechanical delay, which reflects excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities, could be new parameters for POAF. In conclusion, despite the importance of prevention of POAF, there are only a few parameters for predicting POAF. It is therefore necessary to consider both disease-mediated structural remodeling before surgery and electrical remodeling caused by cardiac surgery.", 
    "133": "During heart failure (HF), the left ventricle (LV) releases B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), possibly contributing to adverse cardiovascular events including ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and LV remodelling. We investigated the cardiac effects of chronic BNP elevation in healthy mice and compared the results with a model of HF after myocardial infarction (PMI mice).", 
    "134": "Healthy mice were exposed to circulating BNP levels (BNP-Sham) similar to those measured in PMI mice. Telemetric surface electrocardiograms showed that in contrast with fibrotic PMI mice, electrical conduction was not affected in BNP-Sham mice. VAs were observed in both BNP-Sham and PMI but not in Sham mice. Analysis of heart rate variability indicated that chronic BNP infusion increased cardiac sympathetic tone. At the cellular level, BNP reduced Ca(2+) transients and impaired Ca(2+) reuptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in line with blunted SR Ca(2+) ATPase 2a and S100A1 expression. BNP increased Ca(2+) spark frequency, reflecting Ca(2+) leak through ryanodine receptors, elevated diastolic Ca(2+), and promoted spontaneous Ca(2+) waves. Similar effects were observed in PMI mice. Most of these effects were reduced in BNP-Sham and PMI mice by the selective \u03b21-adrenergic blocker metoprolol.", 
    "135": "Elevated BNP levels, by inducing sympathetic overdrive and altering Ca(2+) handling, promote adverse cardiac remodelling and VAs, which could account in part for the progression of HF after MI. The early use of \u03b2-blockers to prevent the deleterious effects of chronic BNP exposure may be beneficial in HF.",

Patients were randomized 1:1 to bisoprolol or carvedilol with a fortnightly dose-doubling scheme and guideline target doses. Patients with sinus rhythm responded essentially identically to bisoprolol and carvedilol, independent of genotype. Atrial fibrillation patients homozygous for Arg389 had a much smaller response to carvedilol than carriers of at least one Gly389 allele (mean difference 12 bpm, P < 0.00001). Carvedilol up to 2 \u00d7 12.5 mg did not reduce heart rate in Arg389Arg homozygotes at all. Interestingly, the immediate response to carvedilol did not differ between genotypes. The Arg389Gly polymorphism has a major impact on the heart-rate response to carvedilol (but not bisoprolol) in patients with heart failure plus atrial fibrillation.",

The same calculations were done for the molecule in DMSO and aqueous solutions applying the PCM method. The calculated force constants were scaled to the experimentally observed solid state frequencies. The characters of the vibrational modes were determined by their potential energy distributions.

For heart rates (HRs) </=65 beats/min (bpm), we used one-heartbeat acquisition and half-scan reconstruction. HRs from 66 to 79 bpm and >/=80 bpm were scanned with either two or three heartbeats acquisitions, respectively. We used two types of scans. One type was based on a prospective ECG-gated CTA mode and the other using a tube current modulated CFA mode covering an entire R-R interval. The mean BMI of patients was 25.4 (range 18.8-49.3). Fifty-one patients (42.9 %) underwent CFA scanning, while the remaining 68 (57.1 %) had CTA. The majority of patients completed the scan in a single heartbeat (59.7 %).
