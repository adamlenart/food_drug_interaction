    "0": "Although the benefits of antihypertensive treatment in \"young\" elderly (under 70 years) hypertensive patients are well established, the value of treatment in older patients (70-84 years) is less clear. The Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension) was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, intervention study set up to compare the effects of active antihypertensive therapy (three beta-blockers and one diuretic) and placebo on the frequency of fatal and non-fatal stroke and myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular death in hypertensive Swedish men and women aged 70-84 years. We recruited 1627 patients at 116 health centres throughout Sweden, who were willing to participate, and who met the entry criteria of three separate recordings during a 1-month placebo run-in period of systolic blood pressure between 180 and 230 mm Hg with a diastolic pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, or a diastolic pressure between 105 and 120 mm Hg irrespective of the systolic pressure. The total duration of the study was 65 months and the average time in the study was 25 months. 812 patients were randomly allocated active treatment and 815 placebo. The mean difference in supine blood pressure between the active treatment and placebo groups at the last follow-up before an endpoint, death, or study termination was 19.5/8.1 mm Hg. Compared with placebo, active treatment significantly reduced the number of primary endpoints (94 vs 58; p = 0.0031) and stroke morbidity and mortality (53 vs 29; p = 0.0081). Although we did not set out to study an effect on total mortality, we also noted a significantly reduced number of deaths in the active treatment group (63 vs 36; p = 0.0079). The benefits of treatment were discernible up to age 84 years. We conclude that antihypertensive treatment in hypertensive men and women aged 70-84 confers highly significant and clinically relevant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as in total mortality.", 
    "1": "A recently described in vivo voltammetric electrode selectively records rapid changes in extracellular fluid (ECF) levels of ascorbic acid. Using this detector, the nature of glutamate-induced efflux of ascorbate into ECF was investigated using pharmacological tools. Ascorbate signals were shown to be directly related to amounts of microinjected glutamate. Blockers of glutamate reuptake, homocysteic acid and D,L-threo-beta-hydroxy-aspartic acid, virtually eliminate the ascorbate signal. A more specific reuptake blocker (the stilbene isothiocyano derivative (SITS) does not completely inhibit ascorbate efflux, suggesting that the glutamate uptake which is coupled to ascorbic acid exchange is both neuronal and glial in nature. Other pharmacological experiments indicate that excitatory amino acid receptors are not involved in the glutamate-elicited ascorbate efflux; it is primarily a function of the glutamate/ascorbate heteroexchange process as described earlier. The possible role(s) of brain ascorbate in the general functioning of the pervasive glutamate neurotransmitter systems are discussed.", 
    "2": "The incidence of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death is highest in the morning. Inhibition of fibrinolytic activity in blood also peaks in the morning and this inhibition may favor the development of arterial thrombosis. It has been reported that patients treated with beta blockers do not show the typical circadian pattern of onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. This study was undertaken to investigate whether beta blockade alters the circadian rhythm of 2 major fibrinolytic factors, tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Repeated blood samples were taken over a 24-hour period in 13 healthy volunteers: 7 taking 160 mg/day of long-acting propranolol orally for 14 days, and the other 6 taking no medications. Blood samples were analyzed for the plasma levels of t-PA activity, t-PA antigen, PAI activity and PAI-1 antigen. A significant circadian variation of all 4 parameters was present in both groups. No significant differences in peak and nadir values, 24-hour mean, amplitude of fluctuation, and time of peak and nadir were found between the treated and untreated subjects. The data therefore suggest that propranolol treatment does not affect the plasma concentrations at rest or the endogenous circadian rhythm of t-PA and PAI-1 in healthy volunteers. The reported alteration in the circadian pattern of onset of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death by beta blockers does not appear to be mediated by effects on the fibrinolytic system.", 
    "3": "(-)-Bunolol (LB) was applied to the human eye in a commercially available eye drop formulation. LB and its metabolite, dihydro-(-)-bunolol (DHLB) were identified and quantified in human aqueous humour. The compounds were analysed as their trimethylsilyl-pentafluorobenzamide derivatives using gas chromatography-negative ion chemical ionisation mass spectrometry. In the case of DHLB the corresponding 2H3-labelled isotopomers were used as internal standards and LB was quantified against its methoxime derivative. Calibration curves for LB and DHLB against internal standards were linear with correlation coefficients 0.994 and 0.996, respectively. Replicate analyses of a pooled sample of aqueous humour containing LB and DHLB gave standard errors of the mean of +/- 9.8 and +/- 2.4% for the concentrations of LB and DHLB, respectively. The practical limit of detection of the method was ca. 30 pg for LB and ca. 100 pg for DHLB. The derivatization procedure was also satisfactory for the analysis of a number of other beta-blockers which are used in ophthalmological practice.", 
    "4": "The effects of age and chronic propranolol treatment on the agonist-induced rise in intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), an index for the coupling of receptor-second messenger generation, was studied using a dispersed rat submandibular gland preparation. Muscarinic stimulation (10 microns carbachol) caused a rapid (T1/2 less than 2 s) and dramatic (approximately 4.5-fold) rise in [Ca2+]i followed by a lower sustained increase (approximately 3-fold) in [Ca2+]i as measured directly with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent probe, fura-2. The magnitude and the rate of increase of the initial rise in [Ca2+]i and the level of the sustained increase in [Ca2+]i were not different between 2- an 21-month-old rats. Stimulation in a Ca(2+)-free medium reduced the initial agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i by approximately 35-40%, while the sustained increase was abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca2+ from cells in both young and old rats. Chronic treatment for 30 days with 20 mg/kg propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, did not significantly alter the ability of dispersed submandibular cells in old rats to mobilize Ca2+ during agonist stimulation or influence the in vivo stimulated gland output. These results suggest that the agonist-induced rise in [Ca2+]i is not altered by aging or by chronic treatment of aged rats with propranolol and, therefore, receptor-second messenger coupling remains intact.", 
    "5": "The effects of mental, static and dynamic stresses on physiologic parameters before and after beta-blocker (n = 24) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 29) treatment were examined. Mental stress induced similar elevation in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BPs) with and without beta-blocker treatment. During angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatment, the change in systolic BP was significantly greater (p less than 0.05). Heart rate response was attenuated by beta blockers and unchanged by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Skin temperature and galvanic skin resistance significantly decreased (p less than 0.05) with mental stress. Beta blockers did not change the response pattern, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor attenuated the stress-induced reduction of both skin temperature and galvanic skin response. After handgrip exercise, increases in systolic and diastolic BPs and heart rate were similar before and after beta-blocker treatment, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor induced small but significantly fewer (p less than 0.05) changes in diastolic BP and heart rate. Treadmill exercise induced similar changes in systolic and diastolic BPs with both treatments compared with no treatment. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor appears to provide additional protection to that seen with beta blockers during mental and static stressors by blunted changes in skin temperature and galvanic skin resistance.", 
    "6": "Atrial fibrillation has been found to be a significant risk factor for stroke independent of the contribution this common arrhythmia makes via its previously established stroke risk factors. Results of four recent trials in patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation show that warfarin anticoagulant therapy can substantially reduce the risk of stroke without major bleeding complications.", 
    "7": "The ideal therapeutic strategy would be to reverse the underlying cause of cardiac dysfunction, such as hypertension or valvular disease, while removing or minimizing those concurrent conditions or factors that tend to exacerbate symptoms. For most patients, vasodilator therapy has been shown to reduce mortality in moderate to advanced CHF.", 
    "8": "The effects of vanadate (Na3VO4) on pancreatic B-cell function were studied in normal mouse islets. Vanadate did not affect basal insulin release but potentiated the effect of 7-30 mM glucose at concentrations of 0.1-1 mM. This effect was progressive and slowly reversible. It was abolished by omission of extracellular Ca2+ but unaffected by blockers of adrenergic or muscarinic receptors. Comparison of the changes in membrane potential, 86Rb efflux and 45Ca efflux that vanadate and ouabain produced in B-cells made it possible to exclude the hypothesis that vanadate increases insulin release by blocking the sodium pump. Vanadate was also without effect on cAMP levels. On the other hand, it markedly changed the characteristics of the Ca(2+)-dependent electrical activity and of the oscillations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ recorded in B-cells stimulated by 15 mM glucose. In the steady state, Ca2+ influx was increased by vanadate, and this resulted in a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+. The exact mechanisms underlying these changes could not be established but a blockade of K channels was excluded. In the presence of LiCl, vanadate markedly increased inositol phosphate levels in islet cells. This effect was attenuated but not suppressed by omission of Ca2+. A small increase in inositol bisphosphate was still produced by vanadate in the absence of LiCl. These results suggest that vanadate both stimulates phosphoinositide breakdown and inhibits inositol phosphate degradation. In conclusion, vanadate does not induce insulin release, but markedly potentiates the stimulation by glucose. This property is not due to an inhibition of the sodium pump or to a rise in cAMP concentration. It results from a complex interplay between changes in B-cell membrane potential, phosphoinositide metabolism and Ca2+ handling.",

    "11": "the 531 self poisonings represented 1% of attendances with peak demand on emergency services during the evenings. Sixty-four percent were admitted accounting for 16.5% of ICU admissions and 8.5% of acute medical admissions with a mean hospital stay of two days. Only 5% of patients suffered complications, despite the potential seriousness of many events, with an overall mortality rate of 0.5%. The self poisoning rate in Christchurch is currently 20 per 10,000 population. The most frequently involved drugs were benzodiazepines (23%), tricyclic antidepressants (16%) and paracetamol (11%). There were no barbiturate poisonings and no deaths due to tricyclic antidepressants despite their prevalence amongst admissions. All beta blocker poisonings required ICU admission and one death resulted.", 
    "12": "self poisoning is an activity associated with a low morbidity and mortality that remains a resource consuming problem, even in postbarbiturate times. It is infrequently seen acutely by general practitioners however it is a condition that needs greater awareness as prescribed drugs are usually involved. The tricyclic antidepressants and the beta blockers are of relatively greater importance in utilising ICU services.", 
    "13": "The histamine H3 agonist, (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (alpha-MeHA, 10(-10) to 10(-5) M), caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the sympathetic contractile response to electrical field stimulation of guinea pig isolated atria, but alpha-MeHA did not alter the basal tension or the contraction induced by exogenously applied norepinephrine. Blockade of H1 and H2 histamine receptors, and alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors failed to prevent the inhibitory effect of alpha-MeHA, whereas the specific H3 receptor antagonist, thioperamide, concentration dependently reversed the inhibitory effect of alpha-MeHA. At the concentration of 10(-7) M, which was effective for antagonizing the action of alpha-MeHA, thioperamide did not modify the sympathetic responses facilitated by the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol, or attenuated by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine. Our results suggest that H3 receptors exist on the cardiac sympathetic terminals, which may modulate adrenergic neurotransmission in guinea pig myocardium.", 
    "14": "Recent evidence suggests that the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by phospholipase D (PLD) may mediate superoxide anion (O2-) production in human neutrophils. To define the role of the PC-specific PLD products phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in O2- production in response to agonists which activate the PLD pathway, we blocked the metabolism of PA to DAG with propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase. Propranolol (150 microM) enhanced the production of O2- in response to the receptor agonists n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP, 292 +/- 94% of controls), platelet-activating factor (PAF, 932 +/- 215%) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 1305 +/- 475%). In the presence of propranolol, total O2- production in response to PAF and LTB4, which are potent priming stimuli but very weak direct agonists, was similar to that obtained with FMLP. IN contrast, responses to receptor-independent agonists phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin were inhibited (81 +/- 8% and 87 +/- 5% inhibition, respectively). The effects of propranolol were demonstrable in the absence of cellular calcium and were shared by both stereoisomers of the drug. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PA produced through the hydrolysis of PC by PLD is an important mediator of O2- production in response to receptor-dependent agonists. However, the inhibitory effects of propranolol on receptor-independent stimuli suggest that PA generated through the PLD pathway plays a different role in the signal transduction mechanisms of these agonists or that propranolol may have additional effects beyond inhibition of PA phosphohydrolase.", 
    "15": "The effects of cumulative intravenous (i.v.) administration of potent and selective methanesulfonanilide class III antiarrhythmic agents on cardiac electrophysiologic and hemodynamic parameters were compared with those of D-sotalol in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The new class III agents tested were E-4031 [1-(2-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)ethyl)-(4-methanesulfonamidobenzoyl)pipe ridine]; UK-66,914 [N-(4-(1-hydroxy-2-(4-(4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)phenyl) methanesulfonamide], and UK-68,798 [1-(4-methanesulfonamidophenoxy)-2-(N- (4-methanesulfonamidophenethyl)-N-methylamino)ethane]. The class III agents produced significant and dose-dependent increases in ventricular refractoriness, with effective doses required to increase ventricular relative refractory period 20 ms above baseline (ED20, micrograms/kg i.v., with 95% confidence limits) of 5.2 (4.2-6.6) for UK-68,798, 17 (13-23) for E-4031, 75 (58-99) for UK-66,914, and 3,700 (2,600-5,800) for D-sotalol. Significant increases in the electrocardiographic QT and QTc intervals paralleled the increases in ventricular refractoriness for the four class III agents. Significant increases in left ventricular (LV) + dP/dt also paralleled increases in ventricular refractoriness and QT intervals for E-4031 (10-1,000 micrograms/kg i.v.), UK-66,914 (100-1,000 micrograms/kg i.v.), and UK-68,798 (30-1,000 micrograms/kg i.v.), but not for D-sotalol. No concomitant alterations in LV-dP/dt were observed for the new and potent methanesulfonanilide class III agents, resulting in significant increases in the ratio of LV + dP/dt/-dP/dt for E-4031, UK-66,914, and UK-68,798. Potent and selective methanesulfonanilide class III agents therefore may augment cardiac contractility in addition to prolonging ventricular refractoriness.", 
    "16": "A role for parabrachial nucleus in cardiovascular regulation is suggested by evidence that electrical stimulation in this region elicits increase in heart rate and arterial pressure. We hypothesized that parabrachial nucleus may also be involved in control of coronary vasomotor tone. After beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in anesthetized cats, electrical stimulation in the region of parabrachial nucleus produced no change in heart rate, an increase in arterial pressure (34 +/- 6 mmHg), and a transient reduction in coronary blood flow velocity (-21 +/- 2%). Coronary resistance (72 +/- 9%) and femoral resistance (189 +/- 31%) increased markedly. The decrease in coronary blood flow velocity was abolished by stellate ganglionectomy or alpha 1-adrenergic blockade without altering pressor or femoral responses. Injection of the neurotransmitter L-glutamate or kainic acid into parabrachial nucleus also elicited coronary vasoconstriction. We conclude that electrical or chemical activation in the region of parabrachial nucleus elicits coronary vasoconstriction as part of a generalized sympathetic activation. The fact that the coronary response is elicited by chemical activation suggests that cell bodies in the region of medial parabrachial nucleus and subceruleus, as opposed to fibers of passage, are involved in this central neural coronary vasoconstriction.",

    "25": "1. This study investigated the influence of age on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, general tolerability and concentration-effect relationships in 18 patients with essential hypertension (age range 23-73 years) during treatment with dilevalol, a non selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with vasodilator properties. 2. There were no significant age-related changes in pharmacokinetics for either acute or chronic treatment with dilevalol, although there were significant changes in elimination half-life from 7.8 to 11.7 h (P less than 0.05) and in AUC from 261 to 352 ng ml-1 h (P less than 0.005) following translation from acute to chronic dosing. 3. In absolute terms, dilevalol treatment (as compared with placebo) produced numerically larger falls in average blood pressure in the six oldest as compared with the six youngest patients: for example, supine blood pressure fell by, respectively, 29/15 and 10/7 mm Hg during chronic treatment. 4. Using an integrated kinetic-dynamic model, blood pressure responsiveness was characterised by relating the fall in blood pressure (mmHg) to the plasma drug concentrations in each individual patient. No independent age-related effect was demonstrated. There was a significant relationship between response and the height of initial blood pressure which tended to be higher in the elderly patients. 5. Patient tolerability was generally satisfactory and there was no differential age-related effect. 6. This study has shown that the antihypertensive efficacy of dilevalol is not attenuated in the elderly and that there are no significant age-related differences in pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.",

One patient underwent mitral valve replacement and had development of intractable hemolysis due to a paravalvular leak. The other patient underwent ventricular septal defect closure and had hemolysis caused by the Dacron patch. Both patients were given oral propranolol, and the degree of hemolysis decreased substantially. Although the exact mechanism of the propranolol effect on mechanical intravascular hemolysis is unclear, propranolol is thought to reduce the shearing stress between erythrocytes and the foreign material by slowing the velocity of the circulation.", 
    "27": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) under anesthesia is associated with hypertension and tachycardia. The cardiovascular effects of ECT were studied after pre-treatment of 10 patients with esmolol (1.0 mg/kg), fentanyl (1.5 micrograms/kg), labetalol (0.3 mg/kg), lidocaine (1.0 mg/kg), and saline solution (control), using a double-blind, randomized block-design. Each patient received all five pretreatment regimens over the course of five ECT sessions. During control studies, arterial blood pressure and heart rate increased significantly in all patients after ECT (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). The rate-pressure product increased by an average of 336% +/- 14% (P less than 0.01). There were appreciable individual differences in the cardiovascular response to ECT, independent of pretreatment (P less than 0.01). Pretreatment with esmolol and labetalol significantly reduced the hemodynamic response to ECT, compared with fentanyl, lidocaine, or saline solution (P less than 0.05). Esmolol attenuated arterial blood pressure to a larger extent than did labetalol (P less than 0.05). Compared with saline solution (control), pretreatment with labetalol, fentanyl, or lidocaine significantly reduced seizure duration (P less than 0.05) and increased the frequency with which a second electrical stimulus was required. In contrast, esmolol pretreatment did not significantly affect seizure duration. Esmolol (1 mg/kg), administered 1 min before induction of anesthesia, produced significant amelioration of the cardiovascular response to ECT with minimal effect on seizure duration.", 
    "28": "A formula was derived from an active cross-bridge model for expressing the \"time-varying myocardial elastance\" of the left ventricular (LV) wall. To assess the validity of this model's predictions of the behavior of the intact left ventricle, eight healthy beagles were instrumented with ultrasonic crystals to measure LV diameter and a micromanometer for LV pressure measurement. During ejecting beats starting from short end-diastolic myocardial lengths, the predicted values for myocardial elastance and force closely approximated the measured values for the instantaneous external load-muscle length ratio and the external load, respectively. However, in cycles starting from long end-diastolic lengths, the predicted myocardial elastance and force values deviated from the actual values during the shortening phase of LV contraction. The differences between myocardial elastance and external load-muscle length ratio as well as those between force and external load during the shortening phase (shortening deactivation) appeared to result from an internal load in the shortening myocardium that was closely related to the product of instantaneous myocardial force and shortening velocity. Thus this model may provide reasonable approximations of myocardial elastance and force in the intact LV wall. In addition, time-varying myocardial elastance might reflect time-dependent changes in calcium activation.", 
    "29": "We attempted to find cardiac mechanical parameters to account for myocardial O2 consumption (VO2) during ventricular fibrillation (VF). We fully utilized the concept of pressure-volume (P-V) area (PVA), which is equivalent to the total mechanical energy generated by a ventricular contraction. We also utilized a multicompartment model consisting of multiple asynchronously contracting compartments, which we previously proposed to simulate the mechanics of a fibrillating ventricle. The model analysis had already validated the application of PVA to VF in terms of \"equivalent PVA\" (ePVA). ePVA is the area surrounded by the end-systolic and end-diastolic P-V relations in beating state and the isobaric P-V line at the VF pressure. ePVA is supposed to represent the total mechanical energy generated by single contractions of each compartment (or myocyte) in a fibrillating ventricle. We determined ePVA and correlated it with measured VO2 per minute (mVO2) at various ventricular volumes in electrically induced fibrillating left ventricles of the excised cross-circulated canine heart preparation. Correlation coefficient (r) of the mVO2-ePVA relation during VF was high (r = 0.95, P less than 0.01). Comparing mVO2 during VF with that in beating state at an unloaded ventricular volume, we calculated equivalent heart rate (eHR) as an estimate of the frequency of contractions of individual compartments (myocytes). With the use of both ePVA and eHR, mVO2 during VF at various ventricular volumes was estimated. The relation between estimated mVO2 and directly measured mVO2 was highly linear (r = 0.88, P less than 0.01), and the regression line almost agreed with the identity line (regression coefficient = 1.05). We conclude that the new ePVA and eHR concepts can reasonably account for VO2 during VF.", 
    "30": "Serotonin constricts large arterioles and dilates small arterioles in striated muscle. Our study aimed to identify the receptors that mediate this differential response. Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, and the cremaster muscle was prepared for videomicroscopy. Serotonin, applied topically, caused a constriction of large (A1) arterioles that was attenuated by cyproheptadine, methysergide, and LY 53857 but not by MDL 7222, phentolamine, propranolol, or diphenhydramine. The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced constriction of A1 arterioles was mimicked by alpha-CH3-5-HT but not by 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT). In addition, 5-HT caused a dilation of small (A3 or A4) arterioles that was blocked by cyproheptadine and methysergide but not by LY 53857, MDL 7222, phentolamine, or propranolol. Diphenhydramine caused a slight increase in the small arteriole mean effective concentration to serotonin but did not change the maximal response. The serotonin-induced dilation of small arterioles was mimicked by 5-CT but not by alpha-CH3-5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT. These data indicate that the 5-HT-induced constriction of large A1 arterioles is mediated via a 5-HT2 or 5-HT1C receptor, whereas 5-HT-induced dilation of smaller arterioles appears to be mediated by a 5-HT1-like receptor.", 
    "31": "Biosynthesis of the collagen matrix of the heart has been shown to be regulated under various physiologic and pathologic conditions. Biogenic amines have known effects on myocardial function. The authors studied the effects of norepinephrine on myocardial collagen gene expression in the rat heart. Norepinephrine was administered intravenously in a sustained-release manner. Within 1 hour after treatment, the abundance of mRNA for pro alpha 2 (I) collagen increased by 212% (P = 0.05), TGF-beta 1 by 91% (P = 0.05), and cytoskeletal actin by 429% (P less than 0.01) in the ventricular myocardium of the treated rats compared with that in control untreated rats. In extended period of treatment, the abundance of mRNA for pro alpha 2 (I) collagen reached a peak (206% increase, P less than 0.01) at day 3, remained elevated through day 6, and returned to the control levels at 2 weeks after treatment. The expression of mRNA for TGF-beta 1 was coregulated with that of pro alpha 2 (I) collagen. The abundance of mRNA for cytoskeletal actin showed a sharp increase (323%, P less than 0.05) at day 1 and remained elevated through day 6 in treated hearts compared with that in control hearts and returned to the control levels at 2 weeks after treatment. Coadministration of alpha-receptor blocker, phentolamine, led to modest reversal, whereas coadministration of beta-receptor blocker, propranolol, led to about 50% reversal of norepinephrine effects on the abundance of mRNAs. At day 3 of treatment, collagen content of ventricular tissue, as determined by hydroxyproline measurement was increased by 13% (P less than 0.05) in treated hearts. Immunofluorescent light microscopy showed increased collagen deposition and focal areas of necrosis in the endocardial regions in hearts of animals treated with norepinephrine for 2 weeks. In vitro studies on cultured cardiac fibroblasts showed that although norepinephrine treatment does not lead to significant changes in the abundance of mRNA for pro alpha 2 (I) collagen, it leads to increased mRNA for cytoskeletal actin and increased (113%, P less than 0.05) 3H-thymidine incorporation into the cell nuclei of treated cells compared with that in untreated cells. The authors conclude that although norepinephrine has no direct in vitro effects on collagen type I biosynthesis, its in vivo effects may lead to a cascade of events such as induction of growth factors that ultimately result in increased expression of collagen type I in the myocardium.", 
    "32": "Dependence of QT interval duration on cardiac heart rate has been well established and is considered to be an intrinsic property of ventricular myocardium. Conclusive results of autonomic influences on such phenomena are lacking. To evaluate whether rate-dependent changes of QT interval are conditioned by the autonomic nervous system, 28 normal subjects with no heart disease and a normal QT interval were electrophysiologically assessed. The QT interval was calculated at 6 paced cycle lengths (600, 540, 500, 460, 430 and 400 ms) during the basal state, and after beta blockade (propranolol 0.2 mg/kg) and autonomic blockade (propranolol plus atropine 0.04 mg/kg). Because of atrioventricular nodal conduction limits, intrapatient cross-comparisons were performed in 10 subjects (aged 42 +/- 15 years). Single regression lines, evaluated in each subject, showing correlation between pacing cycle length and QT duration at each of the 3 states were analyzed. The mean slope observed after autonomic blockade (b = 0.10 +/- 0.04) was significantly lower than that seen during the basal state (b = 0.22 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.05) and after beta blockade (b = 0.23 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.05); nonsignificant differences were found between slopes during the basal state and after beta blockade. Results showed that vagal tone increased intrinsic dependence of QT at increasing cycle length, whereas sympathetic tone did not seem to interfere significantly. Since (in each subject) beta blockade was performed--or achieved--before atropine administration, the vagal influences are likely to be directly exerted on the ventricular electrophysiologic substrate.", 
    "33": "In 22 patients referred for electrophysiologic study, monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded from the right ventricular aspect of the ventricular septum. The duration of MAP at 90% (MAP90) and 30% (MAP30) repolarization was measured in sinus rhythm, at a constant atrial paced cycle length of 600 ms for 3 minutes and at constant ventricular paced cycle lengths of 600, 500, 400 and 300 ms for 20 beats. Programmed ventricular stimulation from the apex of the right ventricle was performed at a basic drive cycle length of 400 ms and MAP90 and MAP30 of premature beats was determined. Changes of MAP duration were assessed 20 minutes after administration of intravenous sotalol 1.5 mg/kg. Sotalol significantly increased MAP90 and MAP30 in sinus rhythm. This was independent from sinus cycle length prolongation as evidenced by a significant prolongation of MAP90 and MAP30 with constant atrial pacing after sotalol. With slow ventricular stimulation frequencies and with long coupling intervals at programmed ventricular stimulation, sotalol significantly prolonged MAP90 and MAP30; with high stimulation frequencies and at short coupling intervals the action potential-prolonging effect of sotalol was diminished, indicating a reverse use-dependent effect of sotalol on repolarization of the right ventricle in humans.", 
    "34": "To investigate the effectiveness and safety of low-dose sotalol (a class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking agent) in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) and to identify predictors for the occurrence of these arrhythmias shortly after coronary artery bypass grafting, 300 consecutive patients were randomized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function or other contraindications for beta blockers were excluded. Beginning at 4 hours and up to the sixth day after surgery, 150 patients received 40 mg of sotalol every 6 hours. SVT was observed in 24 (16%) of 150 low-dose sotalol-and in 49 (33%) of 150 placebo-treated patients [p less than 0.005]. In patients receiving sotalol, atrial fibrillation was the only noted tachyarrhythmia, whereas in the placebo group, 42 (28%) patients had atrial fibrillation, 3 (2%) atrial flutter, 1 (0.7%) atrial tachycardia and 3 (2%) sinus tachycardia. Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug were noted in only 2 (1%) sotalol-treated patients and 4 (3%) placebo-treated patients (p = not significant). For both groups, univariate analysis indicated that older age, 1- or 2-vessel coronary artery disease, long bypass (greater than or equal to 150 minutes) and aorta cross-clamp time (greater than or equal to 120 minutes) were predictive variables for the occurrence of SVTs. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex (odds ratio 2.3), 1- or 2-vessel coronary artery disease (odds ratio 2.0) and older age (odds ratio 1.1) were independent risk factors for increased occurrence of postoperative SVT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We have reported a case of TPP induced by Graves' disease in a white man with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia. He was successfully treated with radioactive ablation and short-term administration of a beta blocker. The patient has remained asymptomatic for 12 months after treatment.", 
    "36": "In order to create and evaluate a model sensitive to QT-dependent proarrhythmic effects of drugs, a long QT syndrome was produced in chronically instrumented dogs with bradycardia and hypokalemia. Bradycardia (mean cycle length: 1495 +/- 78 msec) was provided by permanent atrioventricular block and hypokalemia (K+ = 2.6 +/- 0.05 mmol/l) by high doses of diuretics. To evaluate that model, six of these conscious dogs were subjected to quinidine, flecainide, lidocaine, propranolol and sotalol infusions. In crossover design, drugs were infused i.v. at rates allowing stable and nontoxic drug plasma levels during the experiment. Four-lead ECGs were recorded for arrhythmias for 30 min before (base line) and 75 min after onset of infusion. Ventricular cycle length was increased dramatically by sotalol, lidocaine and propranolol (+618 +/- 192, +388 +/- 125 and +329 +/- 114 msec, respectively) and QT interval was increased by sotalol, quinidine and flecainide (+56 +/- 8, +31 +/- 7.9 and +20 +/- 5.7 msec, respectively). Quinidine and sotalol, but not flecainide, propranolol or lidocaine, exhibited significant arrhythmogenic activities. During quinidine infusion, most dogs exhibited some ventricular arrhythmias whose most severe forms were runs of ventricular tachycardia. These arrhythmias were suppressed by pacing at high rates. During sotalol infusion, five out of six dogs exhibited typical \"torsades de pointes.\" This incidence was not related to the slowing effects of sotalol on idioventricular pacemakers, because a similar incidence was obtained in five complementary dogs paced at 40 bpm. It could be related to dose, because torsades de pointes occurred only once in another group of five dogs receiving half the dose used in the controlled study. Only quinidine and sotalol, but not propranolol, flecainide or lidocaine, are clinically associated to torsades de pointes. They were also the only drugs associated with proarrhythmic events in the present study, a fact suggesting that QT-dependent arrhythmogenic effects of drugs can be reliably evaluated in conscious hypokalemic dogs with complete atrioventricular block.", 
    "37": "The objective of this study was to determine which of the five or six corneal epithelial layers was rate-limiting in the corneal penetration and metabolism of levobunolol in the pigmented rabbit. Corneal penetration and metabolism were evaluated using the isolated cornea in the modified Ussing chamber. Levobunolol and its metabolite, dihydrolevobunolol, were assayed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography using spectrophotometric detection. EDTA (0.1 and 0.5%) and benzalkonium chloride (0.005-0.05%) were used to disrupt the integrity of the corneal epithelial layers. EDTA, which loosened the tight junctions between the superficial corneal epithelial cells, reduced both the transcorneal flux and metabolism of levobunolol. In contrast, benzalkonium chloride, which disrupted the integrity of the outermost corneal epithelial layers, enhanced the transcorneal levobunolol flux while reducing its extent of metabolism. The extent of enhancement in transcorneal flux afforded by 0.025% benzalkonium chloride was comparable to that seen in the deepithelized cornea. Within 5 min of contact by the corneal epithelium with this preservative, the ratio of dihydrolevobunolol concentration on the endothelial to the epithelial side was reduced by two-thirds. Although direct confirmation is required, the above findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate-limiting layer to corneal penetration of levobunolol resides in the outermost two to three layers of the corneal epithelium, whereas the metabolic barrier resides in deeper lying regions.", 
    "38": "Three adults with DSM-III-R diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were treated with a combination of a psychostimulant and nadolol. Previous treatment with only a psychostimulant had not been effective or had not been tolerated. The combination treatment resulted in an increase in attention and focusing capacities, along with a decrease in anxiety, impulsiveness, and somatic discomfort. These improvements suggest an effective regimen for treatment-resistant adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.", 
    "39": "Propranolol has been demonstrated to be effective in lowering portal pressure in cirrhotic patients. This effect is mediated by a reduction of splanchnic arterial inflow and a consequent decrease of portal vein and portocollateral blood flow. Although experimental studies suggest a direct effect of the drug on portocollateral circulation, little information exists about relative flow changes occurring in the portal vein and in collateral veins feeding esophageal varices. This study addressed the problem in 12 cirrhotic patients selected on the basis of feasibility of Doppler flowmetry in both the portal and left gastric veins. Caliber, flow velocity and flow volume in both vessels were measured by Doppler ultrasound before and at 60, 120 and 180 min after an oral dose of 40 mg propranolol, together with heart rate and mean arterial pressure. A significant decrease in heart rate (-17.6% +/- 1.1%, p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (-10.6% +/- 0.9%, p less than 0.005) confirmed effective beta-blockade. Baseline flow velocity was significantly lower in the portal vein than in the left gastric vein (12.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 15.4 +/- 1.5 cm/sec, p less than 0.05). Maximal hemodynamic effect was reached at 120 min after administration of propranolol. The vessel caliber did not change significantly. Flow velocity fell from 12.4 +/- 0.6 to 10.4 +/- 0.7 cm/sec in the portal vein (p less than 0.05) and from 15.4 +/- 1.5 to 11.1 +/- 0.9 cm/sec in the left gastric vein (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "To study the mechanism of action of sulfonylurea agents on peripheral tissues without the potentially confounding influences of insulin, the direct effect of glyburide (i.e., in the absence of insulin) was evaluated in the L6 cultured myogenic cell line. Glyburide approximately doubled the incorporation of [14C]-glucose into glycogen. The rate-determining enzymes of glycogen metabolism, glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase, were unaffected by the drug. Glucose transport (2-deoxyglucose uptake) was also approximately doubled. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) also doubled glucose transport and showed the same lag period (4-6 h) as glyburide before an effect occurred. Blockade of protein kinase C activity by either 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2 methyl piperazine (H7) or chronic exposure to TPA completely abolished the stimulation by glyburide. Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, also completely eliminated the effect of glyburide. The presence of ATP-sensitive K+ channels was assessed by measuring 86Rb efflux in ATP-depleted L6 muscle cells and RINm5F cells (which served as a positive control). Such channels were present and responded appropriately to glyburide and diazoxide in pancreatic beta-cells but were not present in muscle cells. Glyburide stimulation of glucose transport was completely eliminated by both Quin 2, an intracellular chelator of Ca2+, and verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker. However, glyburide did not raise intracellular Ca2+ levels. We conclude that glyburide stimulates glucose transport in cultured L6 muscle cells by a protein kinase C-mediated pathway that requires new protein synthesis. Although intracellular Ca2+ metabolism may also be involved, the initial step in the mechanism of action is probably different between pancreatic beta-cells and muscle cells.", 
    "41": "Several groups have suggested the use of intravenous adenosine or adenosine triphosphate in the diagnosis of regular broad complex tachycardias. However, the short half-life of these agents has precluded assessment of their effects on refractoriness of accessory connections, and their safety in preexcited arrhythmias has not been demonstrated.", 
    "42": "We examined the effects of intravenous adenosine on accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections in 30 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Intravenous adenosine (12 mg, rapid bolus) was administered to 14 patients (group 1) during continuous atrial pacing at a cycle length 20 msec below that required to cause 2:1 conduction block in the accessory connection (mean pacing cycle length 261 +/- 41 msec). After adenosine, transient 1:1 conduction occurred via the accessory connection in 12 of 14 patients, indicating a shortening of antegrade refractoriness. In three of seven patients, this effect was abolished after intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg). Nineteen patients (group 2) received adenosine (0.17 +/- 0.04 mg/kg) during induced, preexcited atrial arrhythmias. The minimum RR interval during preexcited atrial fibrillation transiently decreased (252 +/- 44 msec to 224 +/- 35 msec, p less than 0.01) after adenosine, but no change in average RR interval was observed (360 +/- 59 msec to 357 +/- 60 msec, NS). The preexcited ventricular response to atrial flutter was transiently accelerated in five of eight patients (415 +/- 21 msec to 360 +/- 49 msec, p less than 0.05) due to shortening of flutter cycle length (207 +/- 10 msec to 180 +/- 24 msec, p less than 0.05). However, 2:1 accessory connection conduction was maintained in all eight patients. All effects were short lived, with the decrease in RR interval during atrial fibrillation occurring for a maximum of two RR intervals only. No patient suffered ventricular arrhythmias or hemodynamic deterioration.", 
    "43": "Adenosine shortens antegrade refractoriness of accessory AV connections, and in some patients this action is mediated by beta-adrenergic stimulation. Adenosine may cause acceleration of preexcited atrial arrhythmias, but these effects are transient and should not discourage the use of adenosine as a diagnostic agent in broad complex, regular tachycardias of uncertain origin.", 
    "44": "Propranolol, a nonspecific beta-blocker has many physiologic effects. Its effects on bone in vivo are unknown, although beta receptor sites have been found on osteoblasts. In this study, the hypothesis tested was that low doses of propranolol could alter bone properties and enhance orthotopic endochondral bone formation. In a group of nonsurgical rats, propranolol treatment increased femoral torsional strength on biomechanical testing. In the rat surgical model used, right femora were fixed to a polyethylene plate and then defects were created mid-diaphysis and subsequently filled with demineralized bone matrix. These rats (defect rats) were randomly divided into groups that were given propranolol or a saline carrier for 19 consecutive days. In the defect rats, increased trabecular femoral metaphyseal mineral apposition rates were observed in propranolol-treated groups. Densitometry and roentgenographic scoring of callus formation after 12 weeks in propranolol-treated rats revealed increased callus and bone union. The results of this study indicate that propranolol treatment can significantly affect bone properties.", 
    "45": "The purpose of the present study was to determine how propranolol modifies the circulatory effects of epinephrine infused to produce plasma concentrations achieved during dental local anesthesia and to evaluate the effects of propranolol on the plasma clearance of epinephrine. The study was performed on six healthy male volunteers ranging in age from 25 to 34 yr. Five measurement series were performed on each of these subjects at the following times: pretreatment control, 15 min after the beginning of the first epinephrine infusion (10 ng/kg/min), 15 min after the cessation of the first epinephrine infusion, 3 min after the intravenous injection of propranolol 40 micrograms/kg, and 15 min after the beginning of the second epinephrine infusion. Plasma epinephrine clearance decreased to 54.7 +/- 9.3% of the control value after propranolol was given. Epinephrine showed initially a predominantly beta-adrenergic action, but this action was inhibited by propranolol. A relative alpha-dominant state may then occur, even when a routine volume of dental local anesthetic is administered to a chronic user of a nonselective beta blocker, and it is postulated that myocardial ischemia may develop in such patients.", 
    "46": "The aim of this study was to see if an enhanced myocardial stiffness is an inevitable consequence of the increase in cardiac mass and to analyze the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on this parameter. The DOCA-salt model of hypertension was used to induce cardiac hypertrophy in the rat. After 6 weeks, the hearts of the DOCA-salt-treated animals were hypertrophied by 67%, and the left ventricular weight, the left ventricular/body weight ratio and the left/right ventricular weight ratio were similarly increased. Isolated hearts were retrogradely perfused at a constant flow of 15 ml/min/g tissue. Contractile parameters were recorded using an intraventricular balloon whose volume was manually adjusted. For each heart, a sequence of three systolic and diastolic pressure-volume curves were constructed: in Krebs alone, after addition of 10(-6) M of propranolol, and after KCl-arrest. In spite of a pronounced degree of hypertrophy, the DOCA-salt hearts had a normal diastolic pressure-volume curve and both the chamber and tissue stiffness constants were not modified. This result indicates that a depressed compliance does not necessarily accompany hypertrophy, especially in a DOCA-salt model in which the collagen content of the heart is unchanged. The systolic pressure-volume curve was greatly modified and shifted to the left indicating an enhanced capacity of the hypertrophied heart to generate force. This increase persisted even when the systolic pressure has been divided by the heart weight. beta-Blockade slightly depressed the contractility of the isolated heart at pharmacological concentrations. At high concentrations, cardiac dilatation was induced. This enhancement in ventricular distensibility had no consequences on diastolic compliance constants. It is thus concluded that, during cardiac hypertrophy, the changes in passive stiffness of the ventricle are more related to collagen content than to the cardiac mass and that beta-adrenergic blockade has no effect on the passive properties of the ventricle.", 
    "47": "1. In seven chloralose-anaesthetized and artificially ventilated beagles, the carotid sinus regions were vascularly isolated and perfused with either arterial or mixed (arterial and venous) blood (PO2 46.4 +/- 1.5 mmHg, mean +/- S.E.M.) to stimulate the chemoreceptors at constant flow and pressure. Cervical vagosympathetic trunks were ligated in all dogs, and gallamine triethiodide (2.0 mg kg-1 h-1, I.V.) was given in five dogs. Right atrial pressure was measured in all dogs, and left atrial pressure in four dogs. Mean aortic pressure was held constant (91.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg) by means of a reservoir connected to the animal via the common carotid and femoral arteries. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was measured by radioimmunoassay and urinary sodium by flame photometry. 2. In seven dogs with mean carotid sinus pressure maintained at 96.0 +/- 4.3 mmHg, stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors for 25 min produced significant increases in left atrial pressure of 41.2 +/- 3.3% (n = 4; P less than 0.005) from 5.4 +/- 0.6 cmH2O and of 30.9 +/- 4.5% (n = 7; P less than 0.002) in ANP from 31.6 +/- 2.1 pg ml-1. However, chemoreceptor stimulation produced significant decreases in urine flow rate of 26.1 +/- 1.9% (n = 9; P less than 0.001) from 0.29 +/- 0.03 ml min-1 (100 g kidney weight)-1 and sodium excretion of 29.0 +/- 2.3% (P less than 0.001) from 8.5 +/- 1.7 mumol min-1 (100 g kidney weight)-1 but right atrial pressure and heart rate did not change significantly. In three of the dogs, beta-adrenoceptor blockade by atenolol (2 mg kg-1, I.V.) greatly reduced the effects of chemoreceptor stimulation on plasma levels of ANP. 3. The results show, for the first time, that discrete stimulation of the carotid chemoreceptors caused an increase in plasma ANP levels, probably due to the reflex increase in atrial pressure that results from an inhibition of the cardiac sympathetic nerves, and an increase in venous return from a reduction of peripheral vascular capacitance.", 
    "48": "The results are presented of investigations on determining the functional state of mineralocorticoid receptor apparatus in rat kidney at diverse stages of the reflex renal dystrophy per se and that against the background of renal denervation along with propranolol injections produced at different terms following the disturbance of nervous system trophic function. It was shown that simultaneous blockade of neuroconductory and humoral pathways of pathological stimulus transmission from central end of cut ischiatic nerve to the kidney prevents the development of trophic disturbances in the organ as tested by the state of mineralocorticoid receptors, to a more extent than the blockade of neuroconductory pathway only. The activity of molecular structures which determine the mineralocorticoid reception in cells of renal tubules seems to be controlled both by central neuroconductory and humoral mechanisms.", 
    "49": "1. Electrophysiological properties of the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH) receptor were studied in Xenopus oocytes with an intact follicle cell layer (i.e. follicular oocytes) by measuring whole-cell current using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. 2. A slow transient outward current was elicited in oocytes, clamped at -60 mV, by the application of rat GRH but not bovine, porcine, or human GRH. 3. The response to GRH was not suppressed by blockers known to inhibit other endogenous receptors present in follicular Xenopus oocytes; blockers used were timolol (2 microM; beta-adrenergic blocker), theophylline (0.1 mM; purinergic blocker) and atropine (100 nM; muscarinic blocker). 4. The current response evoked by rat GRH occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations of GRH for threshold and maximum responses were 1 and 100 nM respectively and the estimated EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) was approximately 7 nM. The amplitude and conductance of the response became larger and the latency, time-to-peak and half-decay time were shortened when the concentration of GRH was increased. 5. The GRH response was reversibly inhibited by a K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium+ (TEA+; 20 mM). The reversal potential for the GRH response was around -100 mV and was compatible with the reported value for a K+ current in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, a depolarizing shift of 40 mV in the reversal potential was observed when the external K+ concentration was increased from 2 to 10 mM, agreeing with the Nernst equation. In contrast, no significant shift in the reversal potential was observed by changing the external concentration of Na+ or Cl-. 6. The GRH response was not suppressed in oocytes treated with an acetoxy-methyl ester of bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA/AM; 10 microM) which penetrates the cell membrane and chelates internal Ca2+. 7. The GRH response was potentiated by pre-treatment with forskolin (0.4 microM; 5 min), which stimulates adenylate cyclase and increases the internal concentration of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP). 8. The GRH response was not obtainable when follicle cells surrounding oocytes were removed mechanically with forceps or enzymically with collagenase (i.e. denuded oocytes). The response was also suppressed when gap junctions, which electrically couple follicle cells and the oocyte, were blocked by 1-octanol (1 mM). 9.

    "56": "Endothelins (ETs) are a family of extremely potent vasoconstrictor peptides. In addition, ET-1 acts as a potent mitogen and activates phospholipase C in smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. We examined the effects of ET-1 on phosphatidylcholine (PC) metabolism and thymidine incorporation in control Rat-6 fibroblasts and in cells that overexpress protein kinase C beta 1 (PKC). PC pools were labeled with [3H]myristic acid, and formation of phosphatidylethanol (PEt), an unambiguous marker of phospholipase D (PLD) activation, was monitored. ET-1 stimulated much greater PEt formation in the PKC overexpressing cells. ET-1 action was dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect at 1.0 x 10(-9) M. With increasing ethanol concentrations, [3H]PEt formation increased at the expense of [3H]phosphatidic acid (PA). Propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phosphohydrolase, increased [3H]PA accumulation and decreased [3H]diacylglycerol (DAG) formation. These data are consistent with the formation of [3H]DAG from PC by the sequential action of PLD and PA phosphohydrolase. Phorbol esters are known to stimulate thymidine incorporation and PLD activity to a greater extent in PKC overexpressing cells than in control cells. ET-1 also stimulates thymidine incorporation to a greater extent in the PKC overexpressing cells. The effect of ET-1 on thymidine incorporation into DNA in the overexpressing cells was also dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect at 0.3 x 10(-9) M. Enhanced PLD activity induced by ET-1 in the overexpressing cells may contribute to the mitogenic response, especially in light of a possible role of the PLD product, PA, in regulation of cell growth.",

    "60": "A 26-year-old woman with severe pliable mitral stenosis underwent successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy. The indication for intervention was severe shortness of breath during most daily activities, despite combined beta-blocker and diuretic treatment (FC III, NYHA). After use of a 2 x 19 bifoil balloon there was significant clinical and hemodynamic improvement. Shortness of breath disappeared, the mean mitral valve diastolic gradient decreased from 24 to 7 mmHg and the mitral valve area increased from 0.8 to 1.8 cm. There were no complications of the treatment, and estimated radiation exposure of the fetus was less than 0.2 rad. Subsequent abdominal ultrasound examination revealed normal fetal functioning. 2.5 months after mitral dilatation delivery was normal. Balloon mitral valvuloplasty may safely be used instead of surgery as a palliative procedure for relief of symptoms in pregnant women with severe pliable mitral stenosis.", 
    "61": "This report describes a novel nonaqueous polymeric formulation that exhibits low-viscosity fluid behavior for ease of spraying with conventional nebulizer, which when sprayed into the nasal cavity, transforms to a high-viscosity gel for efficient retention and drug absorption. The transformation occurs because of the rheological changes induced by a change in the solvent composition of the polymeric formulation in the moist nasal cavity. Such a rheological change would then facilitate enhanced residence time of the drug at the site of administration in order to avoid drainage losses. This study reports the results of the effects of a variety of factors such as solvent composition and polymer concentration on the rheological properties of a polyacrylic acid polymer. An attempt to correlate viscosity enhancement effects with enhanced and sustained-release behavior of propranolol, a drug that undergoes extensive first-pass effects, from such formulations via nasal administration in beagle dogs is also described.", 
    "62": "A new site-specific chemical delivery system (CDS) for alprenolol was designed and investigated as a potential novel antiglaucoma agent. The effect of this compound, alprenoxime (AO), on the intraocular pressure (IOP) of rabbits was evaluated after its uni- and bilateral administration. AO produced significant reduction of the IOP starting at 30 min and lasting for more than 6 hr after its topical administration. Both in rats and in rabbits the i.v. bolus injection of AO (6 mg/kg) led to insignificant transient bradycardia, while no activity was found after oral or topical administration. Alprenolol (ALP) in a similar dose produced a sustained and significant bradycardia for more than 30 min. When the beta-adrenergic blocking activity was assessed against isoprenaline-tachycardia, the same results were obtained, i.e., AO led to a transient brief activity, whereas ALP produced a significant long-lasting beta blockade. These results support the potent ocular hypotensive action and the weak systemic beta-adrenergic blocking and cardiovascular activity of AO: a significant improvement in the therapeutic index. This finding recommends alprenoxime as a potent site-specific antiglaucoma agent with minimal systemic side effects.",

The mean decline in activity of all 30-min periods was 6.8 +/- 3.5 vs. 3.6 +/- 3.7% for control versus propranolol (group 1) (P less than 0.05) and 6.3 +/- 1.8 vs. 9.6 +/- 3.2% for control versus nifedipine (group 2) (NS).",

    "67": "1. The hyperalgesic effects of interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and carrageenin were measured in a rat paw pressure test. 2. IL-8 evoked a dose-dependent hyperalgesia which was attenuated by a specific antiserum, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists atenolol and propranolol, the dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 and the adrenergic neurone-blocking agent guanethidine. The hyperalgesia was not attenuated by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the IL-1 beta analogue Lys-D-Pro-Thr. 3. IL-1 beta-evoked hyperalgesia was attenuated by indomethacin and Lys-D-Pro-Thr but not by atenolol or SCH 23390. 4. Carrageenin-evoked hyperalgesia was attenuated by atenolol, indomethacin and anti-IL-8 serum. The effects of atenolol and anti-IL-8 serum were not additive. The effects of indomethacin and anti-IL-8 serum were additive: this combination abolished carrageenin-evoked hyperalgesia. 5. A new biological activity of IL-8 is described, namely the capacity to evoke hyperalgesia by a prostaglandin-independent mechanism. IL-8 is the first endogenous mediator to be identified as evoking hyperalgesia involving the sympathetic nervous system. Since IL-8 is released by activated macrophages and endothelial cells it may be a humoral link between tissue injury and sympathetic hyperalgesia.", 
    "68": "In vitro it was confirmed that direct interactions between platelets and neutrophils enhanced the process of the formation of cell aggregates. The interaction decreased the ability of prostacyclin, aspirin, propranolol and nifedipine to reduce platelet and neutrophil aggregation. This decrease was more marked for aspirin and prostacyclin but antiaggregation effects of propranolol and nifedipine were more stable to the influence of platelet-neutrophil interaction. It was assumed that the cell interactions might cause the decrease in the efficiency of antiaggregant therapy in patients with cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "69": "Daily variations in circulating melatonin concentrations have been measured at monthly intervals from April to December 1986 in an Antarctic bird, the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri, maintained under natural conditions. Both duration of the elevated nighttime melatonin levels and amplitude of the day-night rhythm displays an annual variation closely related to variations in the daylength. Duration of the nocturnal peak of melatonin secretion depended upon the duration of the darkness, decreasing with increasing daylength and disappearing completely during the summer solstice. The duration of the nighttime melatonin peak melatonin increased inversely with decreasing daylength. The amplitude of the day-night rhythm decreased in such a way that the nocturnal peak of melatonin completely disappeared during the winter solstice. Three days of constant illumination in September did not suppress the nighttime peak of melatonin secretion. The response of melatonin secretion, decreasing after beta-adrenergic agonist treatment and increasing after antagonist treatment, reinforces the hypothesis that in birds the regulation of melatonin synthesis differs from that of the rat. Receptors other than beta receptors may be involved.", 
    "70": "Clinical trials of the hypotensive effect of 0.5% betoptic, an antiglaucoma drug manufactured by Alcon (USA), were carried out at three ophthalmologic hospitals. Similar results obtained in all the trials permit a conclusion on a high hypotensive efficacy of this drug in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. The drug was well tolerated by the patients.", 
    "71": "We recently reported that the secretion of insulin and glucagon by isolated murine islets is pulsatile and suggested that the pacemaker controlling these hormone oscillations is present in the islet. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis of an intrinsic islet neural controlling mechanism for the observed hormone pulsatility. Nerve blockade was attempted by infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) on a background of combined adrenergic and cholinergic blockade with atropine, propranolol, and phentolamine, (ATX). Because TTX acts by blocking Na+ channels, we also studied the effects of other cationic channel manipulations on the amplitude and frequency of the oscillations. The normal frequency and amplitude of glucagon and insulin oscillations were not affected by ATX. In contrast, TTX infusion increased the amplitude of insulin (198.6 +/- 20.9 vs. 507.2 +/- 62.8 pg/min, p less than 0.05, n = 4) and shortened the period from 5.03 +/- 0.26 to 3.33 +/- 0.0 min without affecting glucagon cycles. Whereas the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 had no effect on either hormone oscillation, the ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker glyburide only increased the amplitude of insulin and decreased the amplitude of glucagon, without altering the frequencies. These data suggest that an intrinsic autonomously functioning islet nervous system is the pacemaker for the insulin oscillations and that the control of glucagon cycles differs from that of insulin.", 
    "72": "Elevated sympathetic activity can modulate parameters of immunity. We investigated the role of the low sympathetic activity in resting healthy volunteers by treating them with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (3 x 40 mg/d for 7 days). Propranolol treatment increased the number of circulating T cells but not that of other white blood cells. Similarly, Con A-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and IL-2 formation were enhanced. Although the number of circulating NK cells did not change, NK-cell activity was reduced markedly after propranolol treatment. These alterations are not a mirror image of the changes observed under conditions of elevated sympathetic activity but demonstrate that withdrawal of the endogenous sympathetic tone by drugs such as propranolol can modulate parameters of human immunity.", 
    "73": "Metoprolol is a relatively beta 1-selective beta-blocker used extensively to treat hypertension and angina and as a prophylaxis after myocardial infarction. Conventional formulations are usually administered twice daily and the drug has a tendency to lose its selectivity of action at higher plasma concentrations. Two controlled release formulations, metoprolol CR and metoprolol 'Oros', have made it possible to achieve sustained beta 1-blockade over an entire 24h period and to minimise the loss of selectivity associated with higher plasma concentrations. The CR formulation has been extensively investigated and is the major subject of this review. The 'Oros' formulation is pharmaceutically different from the CR, yet both produce similar plasma concentration profiles and comparable beta 1-blocking effects. The availability of these preparations occurs at a time when increasingly persuasive data are becoming available on the cardioprotective or coronary preventive action of metoprolol.", 
    "74": "The prophylactic effect of flunarizine and metoprolol was studied in a multi-center randomized, double-blind trial of 149 patients with migraine with or without aura. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, patients were randomly allocated to treatment with flunarizine 10 mg daily or metoprolol 200 mg daily for 16 weeks (parallel group design). Both drugs reduced the number of migraine days per month by 37% (95% confidence interval 21-53%) compared with the placebo run-in period. All efficacy parameters were significantly reduced by both drugs and no significant difference was found between the two drugs at any time of the treatment period. However, calculation of the 95% confidence limits showed that each drug may have a superiority of more than 100% on a single main effect parameter. The most common adverse experiences were day-time sedation (both drugs) and weight gain (flunarizine). Depression was the most serious side-effect occurring in 8% on flunarizine and 3% on metoprolol. We conclude that both drugs are effective in the prevention of migraine attacks but a higher number of dropouts occurred on flunarizine because of depression or weight gain.", 
    "75": "For several years now, it has been known that the administering of adrenergic beta antagonists, especially of the beta-2 type, induce hypokalemia as a result of the entering of potassium into the skeletal muscle cells. This fall in kalemia occurs independently from the effect of insulin, aldosterone or kidney excretion, is mediated by the beta-2 receptors and require the intervention of cAMP joined at the cell membrane and the subsequent stimulation of the Na-K-ATPase which bring the potassium into the striated muscle cell. Among the most outstanding drugs with beta-2 effect is salbutamol, which maintains the hypokalemic effect whether administered intravenously or inhaled. It has been used in cases of hyperkalemia, in both children and adults. The initially used intravenous dosage (0.5 mg) caused several side-effects, especially rapid heart beat, seen more in children. It has been recently found that the use of doses as low as 4 micrograms/kg lower the kalemia to values averaging 1.4 to 1.6 mEq/L (mmol/L); in addition, using these dosages intravenously in an average of 20 minutes, no side-effects were seen, even when administered to newborns. For the above, we considered that salbutamol, in the suggested dosages, constitutes an efficient and secure therapeutic method for the initial treatment of severe hyperkalemic patients.", 
    "76": "A 57-year-old female presented with complete heart block and then developed refractory hypotension despite temporary pacing. Moderate left ventricular dysfunction with focal wall motion abnormalities, as well as severe hypoxemia, were demonstrated. However, neither significant coronary disease nor evidence for pulmonary embolus or other lung disease could be determined. Hemodynamic stabilization was achieved with the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump and multiple high-dose pressor agents. A retrospective diagnosis of toxic verapamil-SR and atenolol ingestion was confirmed, and the patient gradually recovered. The relevant literature is reviewed and various treatment approaches are discussed.", 
    "77": "In 75 patients with hypertrophic cardiomopathy (HCM) followed for a mean period of 5.5 years (range 2-20 years), evolution of the electrocardiographic (EKG) changes was assessed. Progression of EKG abnormalities occurred in 35 patients (47%). It was manifested by an increase in precordial QRS voltage in 33 patients, development of new P-wave mitral in 11 patients, and development or disappearance of pathologic Q waves in 14 patients. With follow-up times greater than 5 years, 5-8 years, and greater than 8 years, EKG progression was present in 27, 41, and 80% of patients, respectively. Age less than 30 years at the beginning of study and left ventricular outflow obstruction predisposed to EKG progression within 5-8 years. Patients with progressive EKG changes were more prone to experience clinical deterioration than those without EKG progression (63 vs. 15%, p less than 0.001). With chronic verapamil administration, progression of EKG abnormalities occurred insignificantly less often than with propranolol treatment (35 vs. 64%, p = 0.20). It is concluded that with long-term follow-up, HCM tends to progress in a significant proportion of adult patients.",

The patient presented to the emergency ward with complaints of palpitations which had not been relieved by vagal stimulation maneuvers and propranolol. When intravenous metoprolol failed to convert the rhythm, a nasogastric tube was passed which immediately converted the tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm. The literature is reviewed and problems and complications of various techniques are discussed.", 
    "79": "Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) were studied in experimental endotoxic shock in dogs. Eight animals were pretreated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, propranolol (PPL), per os 12 mg/kg once a day for 7 days. Ten animals served as controls. After an intravenous injection of endotoxin, 1 mg/kg, CBF decreased in both groups, with no significant differences between the groups. CMRO2 increased in the control animals by about 18% from the baseline value both 1 and 2 h after the injection of endotoxin. CMRO2 in the PPL-pretreated animals was unchanged after endotoxin. The CMRO2-reactions to endotoxin in control and PPL animals were significantly different after both 1 and 2 h (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that the increase in CMRO2 following intravenous endotoxin is mediated via beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "80": "Felodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist, significantly reduces systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in patients with hypertension and has been associated with beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris or congestive heart failure (CHF). In hypertensive patients, felodipine does not appear to significantly affect glomerular filtration rate, creatinine clearance, glucose tolerance, or plasma lipoprotein concentrations. Studies comparing felodipine with other agents as monotherapy in mild to moderate hypertension have demonstrated felodipine to be at least as efficacious as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and HCTZ plus amiloride hydrochloride in combination. Comparisons of felodipine with other agents as adjuncts to beta-blocker or diuretic therapy have shown felodipine to be at least as effective as HCTZ, propranolol hydrochloride, prazosin hydrochloride, and nifedipine. Evaluations of patients with chronic stable angina are limited, and additional studies are needed before felodipine can be recommended for the routine management of angina pectoris. Similarly, additional studies are essential to delineate the role of felodipine, if any, in the management of CHF. In the management of hypertension, felodipine 5-40 mg/d significantly reduces systolic and diastolic BP. Although some patients may be controlled throughout the entire dosing interval when felodipine is administered bid, many patients will require more frequent dosing to obtain adequate BP control. Adverse effects associated with felodipine are similar to those of other dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonists and include peripheral edema, headache, dizziness, flushing, and fatigue. A potentially clinically important drug interaction was observed when felodipine was administered concomitantly with theophylline aminopropanol; significant decreases in theophylline concentrations were noted. In summary, felodipine appears to be safe and effective for the management of hypertension when used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. The efficacy of felodipine in the management of chronic stable angina pectoris and CHF requires further investigation.",

Reasons for this are described, as are clinical issues of importance to social phobia, including the extensive associated distress and disability. The use of phenelzine, atenolol, buspirone, fluoxetine, and moclobemide are described. Diagnostic and transcultural aspects of social phobia are described.", 
    "82": "The usefulness of 10 mg timolol orally as a non-sedative anxiolytic premedicant for day-case patients was examined in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. Patients were invited to take part by letter sent the week before gynaecological (n = 40) or oral (n = 60) surgery was scheduled. Indices of anxiety and alertness were obtained prior to administration of the tablet; quality of previous anaesthetic experience was also recorded. In those patients with no previous or unpleasant previous anaesthetic experience a significant reduction in anxiety amongst those given timolol was identified. Haemodynamic differences between the groups were not clinically significant, and return of psychomotor function was not delayed by timolol. Timolol effectively reduces situational anxiety, is non-sedative, and is advocated as a premedicant for anxious day-case patients and others in whom rapid return of psychomotor function is desirable.", 
    "83": "1. The effects of salmeterol, a novel long-acting beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, have been investigated on antigen-induced mediator release from passively sensitized fragments of human lung in vitro. 2. Salmeterol was a potent inhibitor of the release of histamine (-log IC50 = 8.54), leukotriene C4 (LTC4)/LTD4 (-log IC50 = 9.07) and prostaglandin D2 (-log IC50 = 8.81). It was slightly less potent (1-3 fold) than isoprenaline, but significantly more potent (10-35 fold) than salbutamol. 3. Propranolol competitively antagonized the inhibitory effects of salmeterol on histamine release (pA2 = 8.41) and LTC4/LTD4 release, (pA2 = 8.40) indicating an action via beta-adrenoceptors. 4. The inhibitory effects of isoprenaline (20 nM) and salbutamol (200 nM) were removed after washing the lung tissue for 2 h and 4 h respectively. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of salmeterol (40 nM) were much longer-lasting, and were still evident after 20 h. 5. Salmeterol therefore exhibits potent and persistent inhibition of anaphylactic mediator release from human lung. This anti-inflammatory effect may be important for the therapeutic potential of salmeterol in the treatment of bronchial asthma.", 
    "84": "1. The effect of phorbol 12,13 dibutyrate (PDB) on vascular tone was studied in both human and rat isolated pulmonary arterial strips (HPA and RPA, respectively). 2. PDB (1 nM to 2 microM) produced slowly developing, sustained and concentration-dependent contractions in HPA (mean EC50 = 3.5 nM, n = 5) and RPA (mean EC50 = 120 nM, n = 5). The maximal response was 185.6 +/- 25% and 207 +/- 27.5% (n = 5) of that induced by K(+)-rich (80mM) solution, and 223 +/- 34.5% and 176.5 +/- 38.6% of the noradrenaline (10 microM)-induced contraction in HPA and RPA, respectively. 3. PDB-induced contractions were not altered either by the presence of atropine (10 microM), propranolol (5 microM), phentolamine (5 microM) or tetrodotoxin (10 microM) in the bathing solution, or by the removal of endothelium from pulmonary arteries. 4. In HPA, the amplitude of PDB-induced contractions was significantly reduced by removal of external calcium ions, addition of verapamil (10 microM) or trifluoperazine (TFP, 5 microM) and significantly increased by Bay K 8644 (0.5 microM). In contrast, in RPA, calcium-free solution and verapamil had only a moderate effect on the maximal PDB-induced contraction (approximately 20% reduction), whereas Bay K 8644 and TFP had no significant effect. In both HPA and RPA, PDB-contractions in calcium-free solutions were not modified by ryanodine (25 microM) or by 8-(N,N diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5, trimethoxybenzoate hydrochloride (TMB-8, 50 microM). 5. PDB-induced contractions were inhibited by protein kinase C (PKC) antagonists. The maximal response was decreased by 60 +/- 10.5% and 35 +/- 11.5% (n = 5) by 145-isoquinolinesulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7, 50 microM), 70.5 +/- 12.2% and 56 +/- 18% (n = 5) by phloretin (100 microM) and 80.7 +/- 8.4% and 71 +/- 14% (n = 5) by staurosporine (25 nM) in HPA and RPA, respectively.6. Long term treatment (15-20 h) of arterial strips with phorbol esters (phorbol 12,13 didecanoate, or PDB) abolished the contractile response to subsequent addition of PDB.7. These results show that PDB is a potent vasoconstrictor agent in human and rat pulmonary arteries. Unlike the rat, part of the PDB response depends on calcium influx in human preparations. PDB action appears mainly mediated by the activation of protein kinase C. PKC could thus play a major role in the control of vascular pulmonary reactivity.", 
    "85": "In an experimental study, 150 general practitioners studied 468 apparently healthy subjects whose blood pressure (BP) level was unknown or had not been measured for 1 year. The study lasted for 10 weeks. If BP was greater than 95 mm Hg on the first two visits, subjects were randomized into two experimental groups for 8 weeks, with cross-over from betaxolol to placebo and vice versa after 4 weeks. Quality of life was measured at visits 1, 3 (2 weeks), 5 (6 weeks), and 7 (10 weeks) in five ways: well-being, physical state, sexual functioning, sleep, and cognitive acuity. BP level appeared to be effectively controlled by betaxolol as compared with placebo. The results show that no effects on quality of life could be detected by labeling subjects as hypertensives. Equally, almost no effects of active treatment could be established. Learning effects on the two cognitive acuity measurements used were attenuated by betaxolol, however. Apparently, in a carefully controlled study, the effects of increased medical attention and care outweight the potentially negative effects of labeling and treatment.", 
    "86": "The influence of global ischemia on cardiac beta-adrenoceptors was studied in rat and guinea pig Langendorff hearts (LH), both by functional and binding experiments using the specific beta-adrenoceptor ligand (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol. Neither ischemia (30 or 60 min) nor postischemic reperfusion caused any change in beta-adrenoceptor density, affinity or in the beta 1/beta 2 ratio in LH of normal rats or in LH of rats pretreated with reserpine or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or in guinea pig LH, whereas perfusion of rat LH with 10(-5) M isoprenaline (15 min) caused the expected decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density. After ischemia, isoprenaline was no longer able to influence beta-adrenoceptor density, suggesting that the internalization mechanism is impaired. In functional studies, perfusion of the rat LH with 10(-5) M isoprenaline (15 min) shifted the concentration-response curve for isoprenaline to the right. Thirty-minute global ischemia virtually abolished the inotropic but not the chronotropic response to isoprenaline. Ischemia did not impair the inotropic response to ouabain or to calcium, indicating that the contractile apparatus itself was still largely intact. Our results suggest that the contractile failure after ischemia is not caused by a decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density or by a defect in the contractile apparatus but by an impaired second-messenger system.", 
    "87": "The purpose of this work was to study the effect of graded mechanical and gustatory stimulation on the secretion of the acinar products fluid and amylase and the ductal product kallikrein from the human parotid gland (n = 9). The involvement of parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves in the salivary reflexes was subsequently examined using receptor blocking agents (n = 4). Chewing elevated the secretion of all products as compared to rest (P less than 0.013). When increasing the length of the chewing object, secretion of fluid (P less than 0.013), but not enzymes, further increased. The shift from mechanical to gustatory stimulation with 0.5% citric acid enhanced significantly the secretion of amylase and kallikrein (P less than 0.009), while application of 5.0% citric acid increased the secretion of both acinar products (P less than 0.009) more than kallikrein. A differentiated reflex control of salivation both with regard to input and output was thereby indicated. The muscarinic-cholinergic antagonist oxyphencyclimin reduced median fluid secretion between 54 and 76% depending on the stimuli. During citric acid stimulation, but not during chewing, fluid secretion was reduced about 40% by the beta 1-adrenergic antagonist metoprolol, and about 20% by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin. Median amylase secretion was reduced 30% during chewing and 75% during gustatory stimulation by metoprolol. It was concluded that the masticatory-salivary reflex mainly activated parasympathetic pathways producing saliva of low protein content.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Stimulation of neural afferents in the parietal pericardium of anaesthetized, open-chest dogs by local application of capsaicin (0.1-100 micrograms) consistently induced dose-related pressor effects and tachycardia, whereas the application (0.1-1 microgram) of neuropeptides substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), neurokinin B (NKB) or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) had no cardiovascular effect. Capsaicin-induced reflex responses were not affected by vagotomy, but were abolished by bilateral sectioning of the upper thoracic (T1-T4) white rami communicantes and stellectomy. Capsaicin-induced reflex tachycardia could also be abolished by a beta-adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, IV), while ganglionic blockade with pentolinium (0.5 mg/kg, IV) eliminated both the tachycardia and pressor effects. Intravenous treatment with the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin (5 mg/kg) or aspirin (100 mg/kg) had no effect on reflex pressor and heart rate responses to pericardial capsaicin. Also local treatment of the pericardium with either indomethacin (1 microgram/ml) or dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor, BW755C (10 micrograms/ml) failed to affect the responses to capsaicin. We conclude that (i) capsaicin-sensitive afferents which are present in the dog pericardium have a spinal origin and can initiate sympathetically-mediated reflex cardiovascular changes; (ii) the reflexogenic action of capsaicin on pericardial afferents does not depend on local production of eicosanoids; (iii) neuropeptides appear to be without reflexogenic effects on neural afferents in the dog parietal pericardium.", 
    "89": "Alkalinization of the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane by pH shifts from 6.8 to 8.3 caused a reversible increase in current of 3.2 +/- 0.2 pA (mean +/- SE, n = 21) at +/- 40 mV measured using patch-clamp techniques. The current increase was reversed in a graded fashion by the addition of Mg2+ as well as a reduction in pH. Detection of single-channel events was done at 0.5, 1 and 2 M KCl. The single-channel amplitude in 0.15 M KCl corresponds to approximately 15 pS. Reversal potentials derived from whole patch currents indicated that the inner mitochondrial membrane was primarily cation selective at pH 6.8 with a PK/PCl = 32 (n = 6). Treatment with alkaline pH (8.3) increased the current and anion permeability (PK/PCl = 16, n = 6). The membrane becomes completely cation selective when low concentrations (12 microM) of the drug propranolol are added. The amphiphilic drugs amiodarone (4 microM), propranolol (70 microM) and quinine (0.6 mM) blocked almost all of the current. The pH-dependent current was also inhibited by tributyltin. These results are consistent with the presence of two pathways in the inner mitochondrial membrane. One is cation selective and generally open and the other is anion selective and induced by alkaline pH. The alkaline pH-activated channel likely corresponds to the inner membrane anion channel postulated by others from suspension studies.", 
    "90": "Sotalol, a nonselective beta blocking agent with additional Class III activity has been shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias in adults and children. Little information is available on its use in infants. From August, 1985 to April, 1990, 18 infants, 2 months of age or less, were treated with oral sotalol for supraventricular arrhythmias. Their age ranged from a few hours to 2 months, mean 5 weeks, at the start of treatment. Weights were between 2.58-5 kg, mean 3.9 kg and dosage 2-4 mg/kg/24 hrs given in two equal doses, 12 hourly. Sixteen infants had structurally normal hearts, one had multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one was postoperative Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries. Thirteen of 18 infants had reentrant forms of supraventricular tachycardia, six of these had overt preexcitation. Two infants had chaotic atrial tachycardia, two atrial flutter, and one with ectopic atrial tachycardia. Previous antiarrhythmic therapy had been unsuccessful in 12 patients. All infants, except one with chaotic atrial tachycardia, were successfully controlled with sotalol. Ten infants discontinued therapy between the ages of 7 and 18 months as it was felt to be no longer necessary. Mean duration of treatment was 12.8 months. Three had recurrences of their arrhythmia and were again successfully controlled by sotalol. Mild sinus bradycardia occurred in all infants. No other side effects were noted. Sotalol is an effective, safe drug for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias in early infancy.", 
    "91": "Stressful treatments and immune challenges have been shown previously to elevate brain concentrations of tryptophan. The role of the autonomic nervous system in this neurochemical change was investigated using pharmacological treatments that inhibit autonomic effects. Pretreatment with the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine did not alter the normal increases in catecholamine metabolites, but prevented the increase in brain tryptophan normally observed after footshock or restraint, except when the duration of the footshock period was extended to 60 min. The footshock- and restraint-related increases in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were also prevented by chlorisondamine. The increases in brain tryptophan caused by intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin or interleukin-1 (IL-1) were also prevented by chlorisondamine pretreatment. The footshock-induced increases in brain tryptophan and 5-HIAA were attenuated by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine or the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist atropine. Thus the autonomic nervous system appears to be involved in the stress-related changes in brain tryptophan, and this effect is due to the sympathetic rather than the parasympathetic limb of the system. Moreover, the main effect of the sympathetic nervous system is exerted on beta- as opposed to alpha-adrenergic receptors. We conclude that activation of the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the stress-related increases in brain tryptophan, probably by enabling increased brain tryptophan uptake. Endotoxin and IL-1 also elevate brain tryptophan, presumably by a similar mechanism. The increase in brain tryptophan appears to be necessary to sustain the increased serotonin catabolism to 5-HIAA that occurs in stressed animals, and which may reflect increased serotonin release.", 
    "92": "Vasorelaxant and hypotensive effects of tilisolol hydrochloride (N-696) in isolated rat thoracic aorta and pithed rats were investigated. In rat thoracic aorta pre-contracted with KCl (20 mM), tilisolol (10(-5)-10(-3) M) produced concentration-related relaxation, but nadolol and atenolol did not significantly inhibit the responses to 20 mM KCl. The concentration-relaxation curve of tilisolol underwent rightward parallel shifts only to a limited extent in the presence of glibenclamide, a specific antagonist of K+ channel openers. Glibenclamide also shifted the concentration-relaxation curve of cromakalim to the right and in a parallel manner, whereas it did not change that of propranolol. In pithed rats, tilisolol (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, i.v.), but neither nadolol nor atenolol, caused a dose-dependent decrease in diastolic blood pressure and a slight increase in heart rate. Following treatment of the preparation with glibenclamide, the hypotensive effects of tilisolol and cromakalim were antagonized, while that of propranolol was not affected. These results suggest that the vasorelaxant and hypotensive actions of tilisolol involve an opening of K+ channels which can be inhibited by glibenclamide and may also involve additional relaxant mechanisms of action independent of K+ channel opening.", 
    "93": "We report the management of the 831 patients from 18 hospitals which constituted the Irish component of the 17,183 subjects enrolled in the ISIS-2 trial which studied the effects of streptokinase infusion and aspirin therapy given to patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of suspected acute myocardial infarction. 34% of Irish patients (IP) presented for treatment within 4 hours of the development of symptoms. This compared to 44% of the overall group (OG) (p less than 0.001). This represented the lowest percentage of patients presenting within 4 hours in any of the participating countries. The mean delay time from onset of symptoms was 7.9 hours in IP compared to 6.9 in OG (p less than 0.001). The mean delay time in Ireland was longer than the mean delay time in any of the participating countries. The mean age and systolic blood pressure at presentation was similar in both groups. It was planned to treat 12% IP with aspirin compared to 10% OG (p-NS), and 71% IP with subcutaneous heparin compared with 47% OG (p less than 0.001). Intravenous heparin was planned treatment in 20% IP and 24% OG (p less than 0.01). Planned oral anticoagulant therapy was similar in both groups (p-NS). Planned use of intravenous betablockers occurred in only 2% IP and 6% OG (p less than 0.001). 9% IP and 22% OG received steroids before streptokinase infusion (p less than 0.001). 65% IP and 47% OG received subcutaneous heparin (p less than 0.001). The use of intravenous heparin and oral anticoagulants was similar in IP and OG (p-NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "The chronotropic effect of three beta-1-adrenoceptor partial agonists prenalterol, xamoterol and epanolol has been compared on the right atria of the rat in order to evaluate their intrinsic activity and to place them in rank order of effectiveness. The results show that prenalterol, xamoterol and epanolol are all partial agonists. The intrinsic activities relative to that of isoprenaline are 0.84 for prenalterol, 0.59 for xamoterol and 0.29 for epanolol. This rank order of intrinsic activities should remain the same in different species and in man. Both atenolol and propranolol reversed the chronotropic effects of the three agonists. The KB of the two blockers was similar against prenalterol and xamoterol, which indicates that the two partial agonists are probably competing for the same population of receptors. The EC50 is twice as large than KB for xamoterol, which is consistent with isoprenaline working through both beta-1- and beta-2- receptors and xamoterol finds it more difficult to block the beta-2-receptors.", 
    "95": "The effects of propranolol (PRO) and atenolol (ATE) on adult canine myocytes exposed to 30 min anoxia (A:95% N2/5% CO2) and subsequent reoxygenation (R:95% O2/5% CO2) for up to 20 min was investigated. In some studies, comparison of effects were made with that of superoxide dismutase (SOD). Although anoxia alone produced only minimal injury, reoxygenation in the absence of the beta-blockers or SOD was associated with significant losses of cellular viability, elevated release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase, and increased formation of lipid peroxidation products. Myocytes exposed to A/R in the presence of d,1-PRO (20, 200 microM) were afforded substantial, concentration-dependent protection during 20 min reoxygenation. Significant protection was also observed in the presence of 2 microM d-PRO (non-active beta-blocker), but only after a longer preincubation period (2 h). SOD (10 micrograms/ml) provided equi-potent protection to that of 200 microM d,1-PRO. By contrast, the more water-soluble beta-blocker, ATE (200 microM), offered only minor protection. Electron Spin Resonance spin trapping studies using alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) were also performed with A/R myocytes in the presence or absence of drug treatment. Short-term (10 min) exposure to d,1-PRO (200 microM) prior to A/R, or to SOD, resulted in a 71-84% reduction in total PBN lipid radical adduct formation (alkoxyl; alpha H = 2.0-2.5 G, alpha N = 13.5-13.75 G); long-term exposure (2 h) to 2 microM d-PRO resulted in a 51% reduction. These data suggest that the superoxide anion was an initiator of events leading to subsequent lipid radical formation and that the anti-peroxidative properties of PRO appear to be independent of beta-receptor blockade.", 
    "96": "The effect of verapamil co-administration on the hepatic first-pass clearance of metoprolol was investigated in dogs. Plasma concentration-time course of metoprolol enantiomers and urinary recovery of oxidative metabolites were determined after a single iv (0.51 mg/kg) and an oral (1.37 mg/kg) dose of deuterium-labeled pseudoracemic metoprolol, with or without concomitant administration of racemic verapamil (3 mg/kg). Verapamil inhibited both the systemic and oral clearance of metoprolol by about 50-70%. The first-pass effect of metoprolol was completely abolished after co-administration of verapamil, reflecting a marked alteration in the degree of hepatic extraction of metoprolol from intermediate to low. The hepatic clearance of metoprolol was slightly (S)-enantioselective (R/S ratio = 0.89 +/- 0.04) in control dogs. Inhibition of hepatic clearance of metoprolol by verapamil was selective towards (S)-metoprolol, such that the enantioselectivity in hepatic clearance toward (S)-metoprolol disappeared following verapamil co-administration (R/S ratio = 1.01 +/- 0.05). Urinary metabolite profiles indicated that O-demethylation and N-dealkylation were the major pathways of oxidative metabolism in the dog. alpha-Hydroxymetoprolol was a minor metabolite in urine. N-Dealkylation showed a strong preference for (S)-metoprolol, whereas O-demethylation and alpha-hydroxylation exhibited a modest selectivity toward (R)-metoprolol; hence, the slight (S)-enantioselectivity in the overall hepatic clearance. Comparison of metoprolol metabolite formation clearances in the absence or presence of verapamil co-administration showed that all three oxidative pathways were inhibited by 60-80%. The greater inhibition of hepatic clearance observed with (S)-metoprolol as compared to (R)-metoprolol was attributed to a significant (S)-enantioselective inhibition in the O-demethylation of metoprolol by verapamil.", 
    "97": "Betaxolol, a beta 1-selective antagonist, produced marked improvement in eight patients with neuroleptic-induced akathisia. No further improvement was seen with subsequent propranolol treatment. These findings, along with the results of prior studies of betaxolol and metoprolol, suggest that blockade of central beta 1-receptors may be sufficient for efficacy in akathisia.", 
    "98": "1. Salmeterol, a novel, long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist, has been compared with isoprenaline and salbutamol for activity in vitro on a range of beta-adrenoceptor containing preparations from laboratory animals and man, and in vivo for bronchodilator activity in the conscious guinea-pig. 2. Salmeterol, like isoprenaline and salbutamol, relaxed preparations of both guinea-pig trachea (contracted by prostaglandin (PG)F2alpha or electrical stimulation) and human bronchus (contracted by PGF 2 alpha) in a concentration-related fashion. Salmeterol was of similar potency to isoprenaline and more potent than salbutamol on both airway preparations. 3. Relaxant responses of superfused guinea-pig trachea and human bronchus to isoprenaline and salbutamol declined rapidly when the agonists were washed from the tissues, with complete recovery within 10 min, whereas responses to salmeterol were more persistent. In electrically-stimulated guinea-pig trachea preparations, inhibition by salmeterol persisted for periods of up to 12h, despite continuous superfusion with agonist-free medium. However, these persistent responses were rapidly and fully reversed by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, propranolol (0.1 microM). In further studies on guinea-pig trachea, propranolol caused concentration-related parallel, rightward shifts of salmeterol concentration-effect curves, yielding a pA2 of 9.0. The slope of the Schild plot was 1.02. 4. Another beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, sotalol (10 microM), also fully and rapidly reversed established submaximal responses to salmeterol in superfused guinea-pig trachea. However, after administration of sotalol was stopped, the antagonism waned, and salmeterol responses were reasserted without the addition of further agonist. 5. In the beta 1-adrenoceptor containing preparation, rat left atria, isoprenaline exhibited potent, concentration-related, positive inotropic activity, whereas salbutamol and salmeterol were at least 2000-5000 fold less potent, and appeared to be partial agonists. At a concentration of 72 microM, salmeterol exhibited weak antagonism of isoprenaline-induced increases in atrial force of contraction. This antagonism was less marked than that caused by salbutamol (42 microM).6. On the guinea-pig isolated gastric fundus strip, a putative beta3-adrenoceptor containing preparation, salbutamol and salmeterol had only modest agonist activity, being 20-30 fold less potent than isoprenaline and the selective ,beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, BRL 35135.7. In conscious guinea-pigs, inhaled salmeterol and salbutamol were approximately equipotent in causing dose-related bronchodilatation. Whereas the duration of action of salbutamol at its threshold-effective dose was less than 90min, the responses to a similarly effective dose of salmeterol were well-maintained for at least 6 h.8. Salmeterol is therefore a potent and selective beta2-adrenoceptor agonist with a remarkably long duration of action in isolated superfused airways smooth muscle. It also causes persistent bronchodilatation in vivo, in the guinea-pig, when administered by the inhaled route.", 
    "99": "Methamphetamine (2-15 mg/kg, i.p.) has been shown to induce interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA in the rat hypothalamus. The induction of IL-1 beta mRNA was blocked by intraperitoneal pretreatment with beta-blockers propranolol (0.1-1 mg/kg, but not 0.01 mg/kg) and pindolol (0.3 and 1 mg/kg). Prazosin (1 and 5 mg/kg) and yohimbine (1 and 5 mg/kg), alpha-blockers and haloperidol (1 mg/kg), a dopamine antagonist, produced partial and little suppression, respectively. When injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), propranolol, but neither prazosin nor yohimbine, significantly suppressed the methamphetamine-induced expression of IL-1 beta mRNA at a dose of 1 nmol/rat. An i.c.v. injection of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoproterenol (1 and 3 micrograms/rat) dose-dependently increased the hypothalamic level of IL-1 beta mRNA. The present results suggest that the induction of hypothalamic IL-1 beta mRNA by methamphetamine is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors in the brain.", 
    "100": "Glutamate microinjection (1 M, 250 nl) into the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) stimulated heat production in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and caused a rapid and sustained increase in interscapular BAT and core temperatures in urethane-anaesthetized rats. This effect was blocked by intraperitoneal pretreatment with a sympathetic ganglionic blocker, chlorisondamine chloride (2.5 mg/kg), or a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, propranolol (2.5 mg/kg), but not by prior hypophysectomy or intracerebroventricular pretreatment with specific receptor blockers to vasopressin (d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2]AVP, 5 micrograms) or oxytocin (d(CH2(5)[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH2(9)]OVT, 5 micrograms). The results demonstrate that stimulation of SON cells with glutamate elicits a non-vasopressinergic/non-oxytocinergic neural signal that can bring about a sympathetically-mediated increase in BAT thermogenesis. Heat production in BAT is an important mechanism of thermal protection during cold stimulation, and there is evidence that osmotic stimulation can influence thermoregulation. SON neurons play a major role in osmoregulation via release of the peptide hormones vasopressin and oxytocin. The present results suggest the possibility that apart from releasing peptide hormones for osmoregulation, SON neurons might be involved in mediating the effect of osmotic stimulation on thermoregulatory responses involved in thermal adaptation.", 
    "101": "1. We previously found that adrenaline and noradrenaline exert essentially opposite effects on clearance from plasma of chylomicron-like emulsions injected intravenously in rats, suggesting mechanisms that may be implicated in the atherogenic effects of chronic stress and hypertension and conversely in the protective effect of regular exercise. 2. The mechanisms underlying the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline have now been investigated. Chronic adrenergic blockade with either the alpha 1-receptor antagonist doxazosin or the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol slowed the clearance of labelled emulsion lipids from plasma of normal Wistar rats. The results with doxazosin were unexpected in view of its capacity to decrease plasma triglycerides in patients. 3. In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the clearance of triolein (TO) was very slow compared with normal Wistar rats. Emulsion TO clearance provides a measure of lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase, and a defect in clearance indicates either defective enzyme action or poor perfusion of capillary beds rich in enzyme. Defective enzyme activity in SHR was excluded, suggesting redistribution of blood flow away from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In SHR the TO clearance from injected chylomicron-like emulsions was improved by blockade with doxazosin compared with control untreated SHR. 4. The beta 2-adrenoreceptor agonist Fenoterol was infused intravenously during clearance of an injected lipid emulsion. Clearance of radiolabelled cholesteryl oleate (CO) was clearly slowed while there was a lesser reduction of TO clearance rate. Emulsion CO clearance provides a measure of the uptake of lipoprotein remnants by the liver, and a defect in clearance of CO indicates either defective ligand (apolipoprotein E)-receptor interaction or decreased perfusion of the splanchnic bed. Isoprenaline, a non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist, gave similar results. Both compounds reduced mean arterial pressure by about 20-40 mm Hg at the doses employed, indicating that the beta 1 (cardiac) effect of the isoprenaline was insufficient to offset its vasodilatatory effect on skeletal muscle arterioles (beta 2). 5. The alpha-agonist phenylephrine, at a dose which moderately raised mean arterial pressure, slowed clearance of both TO and CO for the first 12 min after injection of emulsion but at later time points clearances caught up with the controls. 6. Administration of a mixture of isoprenaline and phenylephrine produced definite enhancement of both TO clearance and CO clearance. The effect of the mixture was opposite to the effects of of either agonist alone, demonstrating clearly that direct effects on lipoprotein lipase activity or receptor mediated processes were not involved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "102": "For the enantiospecific assay of propranolol in biological material, formation of diastereomeric derivatives is one possible approach. The aim of the present study was the development and optimization of three analytical methods based on different chiral reagents: phenylethylisocyanate and the acyl chloride as well as the isocyanate that are derived from the fluorescent S-flunoxaprofen. Pronethalol is used as internal standard in all three procedures and improves the coefficients of variation significantly. After extraction from human plasma or urine, propanolol is reacted with one of these compounds in anhydrous organic solvents with addition of triethylamine. The diastereomeric derivatives are then resolved on an octadecylsilane column using mixtures of water and methanol with or without addition of glacial acetic acid. Good resolutions of the diastereomeric derivatives are found under these conditions. Conjugates are cleaved prior to analysis using beta-glucuronidase-arylsulfatase and assayed as parent propranolol enantiomers. All three procedures were suitable for analysis of propranolol enantiomers in biological samples in the lower nanogram range (1-2 ng/mL). A preliminary clinical study confirmed the known enantiospecificity in the pharmacokinetics of propranolol and showed high concentrations of conjugates with R/S ratios that were similar to those of the parent enantiomers.", 
    "103": "beta-Adrenergic receptors (R) on several tumor lymphoid cell lines were characterized both directly by beta radioligand binding of 125iodo-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) to intact cells and membranes, and functionally by assessing hormone-dependent changes in cyclic 3',5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels on intact cells and measuring adenylate cyclase (a.c.) activity on membranes. Only two lymphoid cell types, BW 5147 (a T cell derived lymphoma cell line) and TIB 221 (a B cell derived line) displayed significant amounts of beta-adrenergic R by 125I-CYP specific binding. Despite this, no stimulation of the a.c. activity was found in the presence of beta-adrenergic agonists in these cells in comparison with native lymphocytes or cells of the well-known S49 cell line used as a positive control. beta-Adrenoceptor specific uncoupling was confirmed by aluminum tetrafluoride (AlFl4) direct activation of the a.c. system in the beta R-bearing cell membranes and by an increase in cAMP production induced by PGE1, another hormone that activates the a.c. Structural characterization of beta-adrenoceptors by photoaffinity-labeling demonstrates that uncoupling was not due to a structural alteration of the beta-adrenergic R expressed in these lymphoma cell lines, as these R gave similar results as native or S49 cells. It can be concluded that functional beta-adrenoceptors are absent in these lymphoma cells. The possible implication of alternative transmission pathways and original neuroendocrine control in tumor lymphoid cells is discussed."
