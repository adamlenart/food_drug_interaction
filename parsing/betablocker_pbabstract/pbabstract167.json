    "0": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in modulating associative long-term depression (LTD) at CA1 synapses in rat hippocampal slices. Standard extracellular electrophysiological techniques were employed to record field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) activity and to induce associative LTD. Two independent Schaffer collateral pathways were elicited in hippocampal CA1 areas. In one (weak) pathway, the stimulating intensity was adjusted to elicit small fEPSP activity (20-30% of the maximum response). In contrast, 80-90% of the maximum response was evoked in the other (strong) pathway. Associative LTD of weak pathway could be induced by paired stimulation of weak and the strong pathways, repeated 100 times at 0.167 Hz. The associative LTD of weak pathway was NMDA receptor- and phosphatase 2B dependent, because bath application of 50 microM D, L-AP5 or 10 microM cypermethrin blocked its induction. Bath application of 1 microM isoproterenol inhibited associative LTD, and this effect was blocked by timolol, suggesting the involvement of beta-adrenergic receptors. The inhibitory effect of beta-adrenergic receptors on LTD induction was blocked in slices pretreated with inhibitors of protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase, suggesting that these signal cascades are downstream effectors following activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Nevertheless, bath application of timolol or cypermethrin alone did not have significant effect on associative LTD induction, suggesting neither endogenous function of beta-adrenergic receptor nor endogenous PKA activity does have a role in associative LTD induction.",

Health states were 'stable' and 'progressed' glaucoma, and transition probabilities for both primary open-angle and exfoliation glaucoma were derived from the medical literature. Practice patterns were obtained from surveys completed by 54 ophthalmologists geographically dispersed throughout each country. Country specific unit costs were used for medications, patient visits, diagnostics, and therapeutic procedures.", 
    "3": "Over the life of the model latanoprost was less expensive than timolol by 5.3-7.6% (Scandinavia) and 2.1% (UK). Following adjustments, therapy in the original timolol-treated cohort was slightly more effective in each country with a difference in 0.003-0.015 years to progression of glaucoma existing between latanoprost. This may have resulted from the model design, which reflected that physicians ultimately control most patients' glaucoma over 5 years by adding or changing therapy. The associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for latanoprost vs timolol generated by the Scandinavian and the UK models, respectively, were: Norway 351,396 NOK; Sweden 988,985 SEK; Denmark 351,641; and the UK 4751 GBP.",

    "5": "Myosin is a molecular motor, which interacts with actin to convert the energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work. In cardiac myocytes, two myosin isoforms are expressed and their relative distribution changes in different developmental and pathophysiologic conditions of the heart. It has been realized for a long time that a shift in myosin isoforms plays a major role in regulating myocardial contractile activity. With the recent evidence implicating that alteration in myosin isoform ratio may be eventually beneficial for the treatment of a stressed heart, a new interest has developed to find out ways of controlling the myosin isoform shift. This article reviews the published data describing the role of myosin isoforms in the heart and highlighting the importance of various factors shown to influence myosin isofrom shift during physiology and disease states of the heart.", 
    "6": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease in which patients experience a progressive decline in lung function, worsening exercise capacity, and frequent exacerbations. Based on clinical evidence, the progression of COPD could be modified by focus on earlier diagnosis; risk reduction through smoking cessation; symptom reduction with pharmacotherapy, improving health-related quality of life, and pulmonary rehabilitation; and decreasing complications by reducing exacerbations. Smoking cessation has been shown to slow lung function decline and reduce mortality, including deaths due to cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and other respiratory disease (including COPD).", 
    "7": "The importance of resting heart rate (HR) as a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target is not yet generally accepted. Recent large epidemiologic studies have confirmed earlier studies that showed resting HR to be an independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in men and women with and without diagnosed cardiovascular disease. Clinical trial data suggest that HR reduction itself is an important mechanism of benefit of beta-blockers and other heart-rate lowering drugs used after acute myocardial infarction, in chronic heart failure, and in stable angina pectoris. Pathophysiological studies indicate that a relatively high HR has direct detrimental effects on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, on the occurrence of myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmias, and on left ventricular function. Studies have found a continuous increase in risk with HR above 60 beats/min. Although it may be difficult to define an optimal HR for a given individual, it seems desirable to maintain resting HR substantially below the traditionally defined tachycardia threshold of 90 or 100 beats/min. These findings suggest that the potential role of HR and its modulation should be considered in future cardiovascular guidance documents.", 
    "8": "The optimal hemoglobin level in patients with hypertension or heart failure is not yet defined. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the relation of hemoglobin with cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). In 1,326 patients with ISH in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, hemoglobin and cardiovascular outcomes were examined using Cox proportional hazard models. Baseline hemoglobin was negatively related to rate of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 0.81 per 1 g/dl, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 0.98, p = 0.032) after adjusting for baseline Framingham risk score, LVH, treatment, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Hemoglobin decreased slightly during the study and the decrease was more pronounced in the losartan group (13.9 +/- 1.3 to 13.6 +/- 1.4 g/dl) than in the atenolol group (13.9 +/- 1.2 to 13.8 +/- 1.4 g/dl). Hemoglobin as a time-varying covariate was negatively associated with rate of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.90, p <0.001) and stroke (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.99, p = 0.040) after adjusting for baseline Framingham risk score, LVH, treatment, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. In conclusion, in this high-risk population with ISH and LVH, lower hemoglobin at baseline was associated with higher probability of cardiovascular death, and decrease in hemoglobin over time was associated with higher probability of cardiovascular death or stroke; this effect was attenuated by treatment with losartan.",

In ischemic patients, independent predictors of deltaLVEF were absence of history of myocardial infarction, baseline heart rate, and baseline LVEF; whereas in nonischemic patients, independent predictors were baseline LVEF and baseline QRS width (negative correlation). After 1082 days of follow-up, there were 53 cardiovascular deaths and 2 urgent transplantations. Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement (defined as an absolute increase in LVEF > 5%) was an independent predictor of cardiac survival.

Atenolol is unstable in solutions and therefore the development of a liquid dosage form is a significant challenge. Studies showed that the degradation rate of atenolol is dependent on the temperature, indicating higher stability at 4 degrees C. Atenolol syrup is stable for 9 days, with acceptable apearance.

    "21": "This study examines signaling pathways activated by the mouse beta(3)-adrenoceptor (AR) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells at high (CHObeta(3)H) or low (CHObeta(3)L) levels. Functional responses included extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), cAMP accumulation, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation. (-)-Isoproterenol and the beta(3)-AR agonist (R, R)-5-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]-amino]-propyl]1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-decarboxylate (CL316243) caused concentration-dependent increases in cAMP accumulation and ECAR in CHObeta(3)H and CHObeta(3)L cells. For cAMP accumulation, the beta(3)-AR ligand SR59230A was a partial agonist in CHObeta(3)H and an antagonist in CHObeta(3)L cells but for ECAR was an agonist at both expression levels. This suggested that SR59230A, which is normally regarded as an antagonist, can selectively activate pathways leading to ECAR. Examination of the pathways stimulated by (-)-isoproterenol, CL316243, and SR59230A for both ECAR and cAMP accumulation suggested that the cAMP pathway predominates in CHObeta(3)H cells, whereas p38 MAPK is a major contributor to ECAR in CHObeta(3)L cells and was the sole contributor to responses to SR59230A. Western blots of p38 MAPK and Erk1/2 phosphorylation confirmed that MAPKs are activated in CHObeta(3)H and CHObeta(3)L cells by CL316243 and SR59230A but that SR59230A has much higher efficacy. In addition, p38 MAPK phosphorylation displayed differences in drug potency and efficacy between CHObeta(3)H and CHObeta(3)L cells related to inhibition of the response by cAMP. Thus, CL316243 and SR59230A display reversed orders of efficacy for cAMP accumulation compared with Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, providing a strong indication of ligand-directed signaling.",

(p. 1359) extend this concept to beta(3)-adrenergic receptors and report that distinct ligands can activate a single distal response via different signaling pathways. Moreover, they demonstrate that expression density can affect how distinct ligands acting on the same receptor differentially induce cellular responses.

    "28": "Disorders of the skin immune activity are implicated in the pathogenesis of acquired inflammatory skin disorders. Inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus and vitiligo have also been associated with local alterations of adrenergic mechanisms and emotional stress. Here we show that the beta-adrenergic receptors antagonist propranolol along with peptidoglycan, but not LPS, combined with intradermal injection of a soluble protein, shifted the recall memory response to the Th1 type. The specific beta2-AR antagonist ICI 118,551 did not reproduce this effect suggesting that inhibition of both beta1- and beta2-AR caused the Th1 polarization. The underlying mechanism included enhanced local expression of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-23 as well as of IFN-beta and CXCR3 ligands during the innate phase of the response which resulted in an increase of antigen-positive plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the draining lymph node. In particular, modulation of inflammatory cytokines, and IFN-beta inducible genes expression appeared to involve also the beta1-AR. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells and IL-23 were recently reported to play a central role in the pathogenesis of Th1-sustained inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis. Thus, primary beta-adrenoceptors signaling defects or altered sympathetic nervous activity together with selected pattern recognition receptors activation might serve as initiation and/or persistence factors for numerous Th1-sustained inflammatory skin diseases.", 
    "29": "The aim of the study was to develop a novel oral delivery system for the efflux pump substrate acyclovir (ACY) utilizing thiolated chitosan as excipient which is capable of inhibiting P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Three chitosan-4-thiobutylamidine (Chito-TBA) conjugates with increasing molecular mass (Chito-9.4kDa-TBA, Chito-150kDa-TBA and Chito-600kDa-TBA) were synthesized and permeation studies on rat intestinal mucosa and Caco-2 monolayers were performed. Additionally, tablets comprising the conjugates and ACY were tested towards their drug release behaviour. The efflux ratio (secretory P(app)/absorptive P(app)) of ACY across Caco-2 monolayers was determined to be 2.5 and in presence of 100microM verapamil 1.1 which indicates ACY as P-gp substrate. In comparison to buffer only, the transport of ACY in presence of 0.5% (m/v) unmodified chitosan, 0.5% (m/v) Chito-150kDa-TBA and 0.5% (m/v) Chito-150kDa-TBA with 0.5% (m/v) reduced glutathione (GSH), was 1.3-, 1.6- and 2.1-fold improved, respectively. Transport studies across Caco-2 monolayers showed that P-gp inhibition is dependent on the average molecular mass of thiolated chitosan showing following rank order: 0.5% (m/v) Chito-150kDa-TBA/GSH>0.5% (m/v) Chito-9.4kDa-TBA/GSH>0.5% (m/v) Chito-600kDa-TBA/GSH. The higher the molecular mass of Chito-TBA was, the more sustained was the release of ACY. Chito-150kDa-TBA/GSH might be an appropriate sustained release drug delivery system for ACY, which is able to enhance ACY transport due to efflux pump inhibition.",

    "35": "Accessory mitral valve tissue is an extremely rare congenital cardiac anomaly of embryologic development of the endocardial cushion. This anomaly is often associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). A 26-year-old pregnant female was referred to our Department of Cardiology with exertional shortness of breath and tachycardia. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography revealed a flexible circular (1.3 x 1.4 cm), mobile structure attached to the ventricular side of anterior mitral valve leaflet, with chordal attachments structure from anterior papillary muscle. This picture is compatible with a parachute-like accessory mitral valve tissue. We performed an echocardiographic exercise test that shows a systolic flow turbulence starting immediately proximal to this structure, resulting in a small increase in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient (30 mmHg). Therefore we started low dose of beta-blocker therapy in order to decrease heart frequency and reduce the future risk of a worsening of an LVOT dynamic obstruction. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography is critical for the differential diagnosis of LVOT and in the management of accessory mitral valve tissue. In patients without rest and only an exertional mild LVOTO and no other cardiac malformations, prophylactic removal of mitral accessory tissue excision is not required; antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis can be indicated and a regular follow-up is recommended to identify any progression in LVOTO entity.", 
    "36": "1. In atrium and ventricle from failing and non-failing human hearts, activation of beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors causes increases in contractile force, hastening of relaxation, protein kinase A-catalysed phosphorylation of proteins implicated in the hastening of relaxation, phospholamban, troponin I and C-protein, consistent with coupling of both beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors to stimulatory G(salpha)-protein but not inhibitory G(ialpha)-protein. 2. Two 'affinity states', namely beta(1H) and beta(1L), of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor exist. In human heart, noradrenaline elicits powerful increases in contractile force and hastening of relaxation. These effects are blocked with high affinity by beta-adenoceptor antagonists, including propranolol, (-)-pindolol, (-)-CGP 12177 and carvedilol. Some beta-blockers, typified by (-)-pindolol and (-)-CGP 12177, not only block the receptor, but also activate it, albeit at much higher concentrations (approximately 2 log units) than those required to antagonize the effects of catecholamines. In human heart, both (-)-CGP 12177 and (-)-pindolol increase contractile force and hasten relaxation. However, the involvement of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor was not immediately obvious because (-)-pindolol- and (-)-CGP 12177-evoked responses were relatively resistant to blockade by (-)-propranolol. Abrogation of cardiostimulant effects of (-)-CGP 12177 in beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor double-knockout mice, but not beta(2)-adrenoceptor-knockout mice, revealed an obligatory role of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor. On the basis of these results, two 'affinity states' have been designated, the beta(1H)- and beta(1L)-adrenoceptor, where the beta(1H)-adrenoceptor is activated by noradrenaline and blocked with high affinity by beta-blockers and the beta(1L)-adrenoceptor is activated by drugs such as (-)-CGP 12177 and (-)-pindolol and blocked with low affinity by beta-blockers such as (-)-propranolol. The beta(1H)- and beta(1L)-adrenoceptor states are consistent with high- and low-affinity binding sites for (-)-[(3)H]-CGP 12177 radioligand binding found in cardiac muscle and recombinant beta(1)-adrenoceptors. 3. There are two common polymorphic locations of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, at amino acids 49 (Ser/Gly) and 389 (Arg/Gly). Their existence has raised several questions, including their role in determining the effectiveness of heart failure treatment with beta-blockers. We have investigated the effect of long-term maximally tolerated carvedilol administration (> 1 year) on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (mean left ventricular ejection fraction 23 +/- 7%; n = 135 patients). The administration of carvedilol improved LVEF to 37 +/- 13% (P < 0.005); however, the improvement was variable, with 32% of patients showing pound 5% improvement. Upon segregation of patients into Arg389Gly-beta(1)-adrenoceptors, it was found that carvedilol caused a greater increase in left ventricular ejection faction in patients carrying the Arg389 allele with Arg389Arg > Arg389Gly > Gly389Gly.", 
    "37": "In patients with impaired myocardial contractility associated with downregulation of the beta-receptors, compounds inhibiting phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 may be useful to increase contractility. The PDE3 inhibitor enoximone has been shown to improve pump-function independent from the beta-receptor pathway. A simultaneous decrease in ventricular preload and afterload by vasodilation has led to the term 'inodilator'. Esmolol is the only available ultra-short acting intravenous beta-blocking agent. Due to its half-life of approximately 9 min, beta-blockade, and thus, heart rate, can easily be titrated. Esmolol appears to be a helpful tool to avoid myocardial ischemia (e.g., in the perioperative setting). As with all other beta-blockers, it has dose-dependent negative inotropic effects, and this limits its use in patients with severe heart failure showing low cardiac output. It seems reasonable that an intravenous combination of both approaches, enoximone-induced positive inotropy and esmolol-associated protection from myocardial ischemia, might offer advantages by producing beneficial hemodynamic effects and by compensating each other's limitations in a complementary way. In spite of some promising results, the place of a combination of enoximone and esmolol in the process of treating patients with (acute) heart failure showing low output is still not entirely clear, and needs further confirmation.", 
    "38": "Stressful exercise has been found to reduce the proinflammatory cytokine response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, we aimed to determine whether receptor antagonists for corticosterone or catecholamines would increase the LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) response after exhaustive exercise. Female F344 rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups: control (vehicle), RU-486 (glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, 30 mg/kg)-, propranolol [nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor (AR) blockade, 30 mg/kg]-, atenolol (beta(1)-AR blockade, 30 mg/kg)-, or ICI 118551 (beta(2)-AR blockade, 30 mg/kg)-treated groups. Each antagonist was given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to exercise or control period. Exercised rats ran until exhaustion on a treadmill at gradually increasing speeds, from 10 to 36 m/min at 15% grade. Immediately postexercise or control period all rats were injected with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Plasma TNF-alpha was reduced by prior exercise to approximately 10% of that of sedentary controls (p < 0.01). Plasma TNF-alpha concentration in exercised RU-486-treated rats was significantly different than that of nonexercised rats (19.2%, p < 0.01) and not different from exercised rats. However, pretreatment of rats with the nonselective beta-AR blocker propranolol almost completely reversed the exercise-induced suppression of plasma TNF-alpha in response to LPS. beta(1)-AR pretreatment almost completely attenuated the exercise-induced suppression of LPS-induced plasma TNF-alpha while beta(2)-antagonism had a partial effect. These results indicate that exercise-induced catecholamines, acting through beta-ARs (especially the beta(1)-AR), are responsible for the exercise-induced suppression of plasma TNF-alpha after LPS administration.",

Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis identified dilated cardiomyopathy (beta = 18.32, p = 0.0004), baseline LVEF (beta = -0.85, p = 0.0020), use of amiodarone (beta = -22.58, p = 0.0034) and square of digoxin dose (beta = -314.25, p = 0.0059) at stable beta-blocker dose as independent predictors of LVEF improvement, where beta is the estimated regression coefficient. We did not find any novel variant of beta1-adrenoceptor gene other than those previously reported at codons 49 and 389, with the allele distributions similar to those found in Caucasians, and these polymorphisms did not imply therapeutic response to beta-blocker.",

However, the direct role of adipose tissue in beta-cell dysfunction has not been well understood. In this study, we examined the effects of 3T3-L1 adipocytes on MIN6 insulin-secreting cells in a co-culture system. MIN6 cells used here kept most of beta-cell functions but less sensitive to glucose stimulation. Tolbutamide, the KATP channel blocker, was therefore used to stimulate insulin secretion in this report. MIN6 cells co-cultured with 3T3-L1 adipocytes had significantly reduced intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and lost the ability to secrete insulin in response to tolbutamide, compared to the control cells. 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly decreased the expression of insulin, glucokinase and Kir6.2 genes but increased the expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) in MIN6 cells after one week of co-culture, as measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. 3T3-L1 adipocyte-conditioned medium also significantly decreased insulin secretion and the expression of insulin, glucokinase and Kir6.2 genes in MIN6 cells. The conditioned medium also reduced tyrosine kinase activity in MIN6 cells. The inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase, genistein, decreased the expression of glucokinase and Kir6.2 in MIN6 cells, while two free fatty acids, oleic acid and linoleic acids, were found to increase UCP-2 expression. The present study demonstrates that 3T3-L1 adipocytes directly impair insulin secretion and the expression of important genes in MIN6 cells. The effects of T3-L1 adipocytes on MIN6 cells are ascribed to secreted bioactive factors and may be mediated via multiple pathways, which include the upregulation of UCP-2 expression via free fatty acids, and downregulation of glucokinase and Kir6.2 expression via decreasing protein tyrosine kinase activity.",

At days 20, 40 and 60 of postnatal life, the contractile parameters and concentrations of sympathetic neurotransmitters were measured in both right and left ventricles. In rats with chemical sympathectomy, concentrations of norepinephrine were reduced almost completely in both ventricles at all time points. The contractility of the left ventricle papillary muscles was substantially decreased at all time points. In contrast, the contractility of the right ventricle papillary muscles was decreased only transiently, showing a recovery at day 60 regardless of the permanently decreased concentration of norepinephrine. The concentration of neuropeptide Y, another neurotransmitter present in sympathetic nerves, showed the same developmental trend as contractility: permanent reduction in the left ventricle, transient reduction with a recovery at day 60 in the right ventricle. The data indicate that the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the postnatal development of cardiac contractility and neuropeptide Y may contribute to this effect.",

    "76": "The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea infects its host by forming a specialized infection structure, the appressorium, on the plant leaf. The enormous turgor pressure generated within the appressorium drives the emerging penetration peg forcefully through the plant cuticle. Hitherto, the involvement of cutinase(s) in this process has remained unproven. We identified a specific M. grisea cutinase, CUT2, whose expression is dramatically upregulated during appressorium maturation and penetration. The cut2 mutant has reduced extracellular cutin-degrading and Ser esterase activity, when grown on cutin as the sole carbon source, compared with the wild-type strain. The cut2 mutant strain is severely less pathogenic than the wild type or complemented cut2/CUT2 strain on rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). It displays reduced conidiation and anomalous germling morphology, forming multiple elongated germ tubes and aberrant appressoria on inductive surfaces. We show that Cut2 mediates the formation of the penetration peg but does not play a role in spore or appressorium adhesion, or in appressorial turgor generation. Morphological and pathogenicity defects in the cut2 mutant are fully restored with exogenous application of synthetic cutin monomers, cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and diacylglycerol (DAG). We propose that Cut2 is an upstream activator of cAMP/protein kinase A and DAG/protein kinase C signaling pathways that direct appressorium formation and infectious growth in M. grisea. Cut2 is therefore required for surface sensing leading to correct germling differentiation, penetration, and full virulence in this model fungus.", 
    "77": "Beta-blockers are currently contraindicated in asthma because their acute administration may be associated with worsening bronchospasm. However, their effects and safety with their chronic administration are not well evaluated. The rationale for this pilot study was based on the paradigm shift that was observed with the use of beta-blockers in congestive heart failure, which once contraindicated because of their acute detrimental effects, have now been shown to reduce mortality with their chronic use. We hypothesized that certain beta-blockers may also be safe and useful in chronic asthma therapy. In this prospective, open-label, pilot study, we evaluated the safety and effects of escalating doses of the beta-blocker, nadolol, administered over 9 weeks to 10 subjects with mild asthma. Dose escalation was performed on a weekly basis based on pre-determined safety, lung function, asthma control and hemodynamic parameters. The primary objective was to evaluate safety and secondary objectives were to evaluate effects on airway hyperresponsiveness, and indices of respiratory function. The escalating administration of nadolol was well tolerated. In 8 out of the 10 subjects, 9 weeks of nadolol treatment produced a significant, dose-dependent increase in PC20 that reached 2.1 doubling doses at 40 mg (P<0.0042). However, there was also a dose-independent 5% reduction in mean FEV1 over the study period (P<0.01). We conclude that in most patients with mild asthma, the dose-escalating administration of the beta-blocker, nadolol, is well tolerated and may have beneficial effects on airway hyperresponsiveness. Our findings warrant further testing in future larger trials.",

A component current of the AHP, I(M), was evaluated with a specific blocker of this current, and showed no apparent contribution to the learning-related increase in neuronal excitability.

Given the heterogeneity of hypertension as a disease, the marked variability in an individual patient's BP response, and low response rates with monotherapy, expert groups such as the Joint National Committee (JNC) emphasize the value of combination antihypertensive regimens, noting that combinations, usually of different classes, have additive antihypertensive effects. Metoprolol succinate extended-release tablet is a beta-1 (cardio-selective) adrenoceptor-blocking agent formulated to provide controlled and predictable release of metoprolol. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) is a well-established diuretic and antihypertensive agent, which promotes natruresis by acting on the distal renal tubule. The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety/tolerability of the antihypertensive combination tablet, metoprolol extended release hydrochlorothiazide, essentially reflect the well-described independent characteristics of each of the component agents. Not only is the combination product more effective than monotherapy with the individual components but the combination product allows a low-dose multidrug regimen as an alternative to high-dose monotherapy, thereby, minimizing the likelihood of dose-related side-effects.",

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be the major risk factor associated with the development of this neuropathy. Randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that in some patients the disease progresses, even after lowering the IOP. Several researchers have devised ways to induce elevated IOP in the rat eye with the aim of impeding the flow of aqueous humour out of the eye. Chronic ocular hypertension in rats induces morphofunctional changes in the optic nerve head and retina. Death of ganglion cells is thought to follow an apoptotic pathway. Changes have also been reported in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, levels of cyclooxygenase, and nitric oxide synthase, endothelin 1 and brain derived neurotrophic factor. Other mechanisms include intracellular electrolyte imbalance, microglial phagocytosis and elevated glutamate levels. Neuroprotection is the treatment strategy by preventing neuronal death.

However, the reasons for such undertreatment are not well understood. A total of 1380 Medicare patients who survived at least 90 d after MI and had prescription drug coverage through Pennsylvania's medication assistance program for the elderly were studied. Filled prescriptions were used to assess use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers, and statins within 90 d of MI. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and health care utilization before MI also were ascertained. We used logistic regression to test the association between kidney function and postdischarge use of each medication. Overall, 619 (45%) patients filled a prescription for a beta blocker, 675 (49%) received an ACEI or ARB, and 406 (29%) received a statin after discharge but within 90 d after their admission for MI. Reduced kidney function was associated with both lower beta blocker and statin use (P = 0.01 and P = 0.002, respectively), but after multivariate adjustment, these associations disappeared (P = 0.23 and P = 0.62, respectively). Use of ACEI or ARB was nearly half in patients with estimated GFR <30 ml/min compared with patients with better kidney function in univariate and multivariate analyses (P < 0.001). Analyses using serum creatinine measurements rather than estimations of GFR yielded similar results. Differences in other characteristics such as age, rather than kidney function, may be responsible for much or all the reported reduction in use of preventive medications after MI seen in patients with chronic kidney disease.",

We investigated the functional expression of P2 receptor subtypes on TBCs of mouse fungiform papillae. Electrophysiological studies showed that 100 microm ATP applied to their basolateral membranes either depolarized or hyperpolarized a few cells per taste bud. Ca(2+) imaging showed that similarly applied 1 mum ATP, 30 microm BzATP (a P2X(7) agonist), or 1 microm 2MeSATP (a P2Y(1) and P2Y(11) agonist) increased intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, but 100 microm UTP (a P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) agonist) and alpha,beta-meATP (a P2X agonist except for P2X(2), P2X(4) and P2X(7)) did not. RT-PCR suggested the expression of P2X(2), P2X(4), P2X(7), P2Y(1), P2Y(13) and P2Y(14) among the seven P2X subtypes and seven P2Y subtypes examined. Immunohistostaining confirmed the expression of P2X(2). The exposure of the basolateral membranes to 3 mm ATP for 30 min caused the uptake of Lucifer Yellow CH in a few TBCs per taste bud. This was antagonized by 100 microm PPADS (a non-selective P2 blocker) and 1 microm KN-62 (a P2X(7) blocker). These results showed for the first time the functional expression of P2X(2) and P2X(7) on TBCs. The roles of P2 receptor subtypes in the taste transduction, and the renewal of TBCs, are discussed.",

    "94": "We describe three cases of thyroid storm who developed sudden cardiorespiratory arrest soon after the administration of propranolol orally. CASE 1: A 43 years old Chinese lady presented with complaints of fever and chills. She had a urinary tract infection and also had signs of overt thyrotoxicosis. She was diagnosed to have thyroid storm and was started on oral propranolol, carbimazole and intravenous hydrocortisone and ceftriaxone. Soon after propranolol was given orally she developed an asystolic cardiorespiratory arrest. CASE 2: A 72 years old Chinese gentleman presented with confusion, fever and rapid atrial fibrillation. He was diagnosed to have thyroid storm and was started on oral propranolol, carbimazole and intravenous hydrocortisone and ceftriaxone. He developed a cardiorespiratory arrest about 6 hours after commencement of therapy. CASE 3: A 48-year-old Chinese gentleman presented with complains of dyspnoea and palpitations. He was diagnosed to have thyroid storm and was started on oral propranolol, carbimazole, intravenous hydrocortisone and antibiotics. About 12 hours after admission, he developed a cardiorespiratory arrest. All three patients developed cardiorespiratory arrest soon after the administration of propranolol orally. We conclude that in selective patients who have low output cardiac failure in association with severe thyrotoxicosis, it maybe advisable to avoid use of a beta blocker. A safer alternative is the use of ultra short-acting beta-blockers, such as intravenous esmolol, with extreme caution.", 
    "95": "The modulatory action of beta-adrenergic and opioidergic pathways on the cortisol response to acute stressors was investigated using gonadectomized male miniature pigs. Three types of stressors, nose-snare (NS, for 2 min. each on four occasions at 30 min. intervals); high intensity cracker blasts (CB, two blasts at 3 min intervals) and ACTH (1 i.u./kg BW, i.v.) were utilized 80 min after start of blood sampling. For assessment of cortisol blood samples were withdrawn every 20 min for 200 min. In addition, animals received i.v. injections of either isoproterenol (5 microg/ kg) or propranolol (0.5 mg/kg) or naloxone (1 mg/kg) 15 or 30 min before the application of stressor. Stress of repeated NS application as well as ACTH treatment, resulted in immediate secretion of cortisol (p<0.001). Blast of crackers resulted in a transient increase in cortisol (p<0.05). Isoproterenol stimulated the basal cortisol secretion for about 20 min in unstressed pigs (p <0.01) but propranolol had no effects. Isoproterenol also reinforced (p<0.05) the effect of CB, but had no effect on the cortisol response to nose-snare. In contrast, response to NS was reduced (p=0.02) by propranolol. Neither isoproterenol nor propranolol altered the cortisol response to ACTH application. Pretreatment with naloxone significantly increased the cortisol response to NS (p<0.01) and to CB (p<0.01), but had no effects on ACTH-induced cortisol release. In conclusion, the beta-adrenergic involvement is evident in the cortisol response to acute stress of nose-snare. Furthermore, the results indicate that activation of endogenous opioid system during stress mitigates adrenal response.",

Effective secondary prevention following acute coronary syndrome requires multiple medications targeting the different mechanisms of atherothrombosis. The 2002 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of unstable angina and non ST-segment myocardial infarction and the 2004 guidelines for ST-segment myocardial infarction assign priority to the long-term administration of four critical classes of drugs: antiplatelet agents, in particular aspirin and clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins.",

Suboptimal compliance with current recommendations, as with other management guidelines, arises from a host of entrenched physician, patient, and system-related factors. Optimal management of acute coronary syndrome acknowledges a continuum of care in which acute stabilization represents a single important component. Early, in-hospital implementation of secondary preventive measures reinforces the continuum of care approach, promoting a successful transition from treatment to prevention, inpatient to outpatient management, and, when appropriate, subspecialist to generalist care.",

BK(Ca) current activation by eugenosedin-A was significantly inhibited by an adenylate cyclase inhibitor (SQ 22536, 10 microM), a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (ODQ, 10 microM), competitive antagonists of cAMP and cGMP (Rp-cAMP, 100 microM and Rp-cGMP, 100 microM), and cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors (KT5720, 0.3 microM and KT5823, 0.3 microM). Eugenosedin-A reversed the inhibition of BK(Ca) current induced by the protein kinase C activator, phorbol myristyl acetate (PMA, 0.1 microM).

    "106": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common postoperative arrhythmia with significant consequences on patient health. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) complicates up to 8% of all noncardiac surgeries, between 3% and 30% of noncardiac thoracic surgeries, and between 16% and 46% of cardiac surgeries. POAF has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and longer, more costly hospital stays. The risk of POAF after cardiac and noncardiac surgery may be affected by several epidemiologic and intraoperative factors, as well as by the presence of preexisting cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. POAF is typically a transient, reversible phenomenon that may develop in patients who possess an electrophysiologic substrate for the arrhythmia that is present before or as a result of surgery. Numerous studies support the efficacy of beta-blockers in POAF prevention; they are currently the most common medication used in POAF prophylaxis. Perioperative amiodarone, sotalol, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and magnesium sulfate have been associated with a reduction in the occurrence of POAF. Biatrial pacing is a nonpharmacologic method that has been associated with a reduced risk of POAF. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors may decrease the risk of POAF. Finally, based on recent evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the risk of permanent atrial fibrillation, these medications may also hold promise in POAF prophylaxis. However, there is a need for further large-scale investigations that incorporate standard methodologies and diagnostic criteria, which have been lacking in past trials.",

This study sought to identify modifiable factors that are associated with survival after CA in hemodialysis clinics. Patients who experienced in-center CA in the Gambro Healthcare System in the United States from 2002 to 2005 were identified. Patient characteristics at the time of arrest were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors at 24 h and 6 mo after CA. A total of 729 patients sustained in-clinic CA; 310 (42.5%) patients survived 24 h, and 80 (11%) patients survived 6 mo. Traditional risk factors, including cardiovascular comorbidities, diabetes, hemoglobin, and dialysis adequacy, did not predict survival at either time point. After adjustment for case-mix factors, presence of indwelling catheter, and concomitant medications, only use of beta blockers (BBL), calcium-channel blockers (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) remained significantly associated with survival (BBL odds ratio [OR] 0.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.61]; CCB OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.23 to 0.76]; ACEI/ARB OR 0.51 [95% CI 0.28 to 0.95]). The beneficial effect of ACEI/ARB and BBL on survival increased sequentially with higher medication dosages. Prescription of BBL at the time of the event was the only predictive variable of survival at 24 h. Therefore, traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not associated with survival after CA in this hemodialysis cohort. The benefits that are associated with BBL, CCB, and ACEI/ARB suggest that these medications may improve the chances of survival after CA.",

After inclusion of study medication cost, net cost per patient was 51 Euros ($64) higher for losartan than atenolol. The net cost per LYG was 864 Euros ($1083), which is below the Dutch pharmacoeconomic threshold of 20,000 Euros/LYG (~$25,000/LYG) for accepting interventions.

Beta-blocker use was ascertained from electronic pharmacy databases and readmissions within 12 months were identified from hospital discharge databases. Extended Cox regression was used to examine the association between receipt of different beta blockers and risk of readmission for HF after adjustment for potential confounders. During follow-up, there were 3,234 person-years of exposure to beta blockers (39.3% atenolol, 42.0% metoprolol tartrate, 12.3% carvedilol, and 6.4% other). Crude 12-month rates of readmissions for HF were high overall (42.6 per 100 person-years). After adjustment for potential confounders, cumulative exposure to each beta blocker, and propensity to receive carvedilol compared with atenolol, adjusted risks of readmission were not significantly different for metoprolol tartrate (adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.05) or for carvedilol (adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.14). In conclusion, in a contemporary cohort of high-risk patients hospitalized with HF, we found that adjusted risks of rehospitalization for HF within 12 months were not significantly different in patients receiving atenolol, shorter-acting metoprolol tartrate, or carvedilol.",

This review summarizes data showing that behavioral stress can increase the density of catecholaminergic neural fibers within lymphoid organs of adult primates. Stress-induced neural densification is associated with increased expression of neurotrophic factors, and functional consequences include alterations in lymph node cytokine expression and increased replication of a lymphotropic virus. The finding that behavioral stress can tonically alter lymph node neural structure suggests that behavioral factors could exert long-term regulatory influences on the initiation, maintenance, and resolution of immune responses.",

Here we show that heart failure can also be precipitated through myocyte necrosis associated with Ca2+ overload. Inducible transgenic mice with enhanced sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) activity showed progressive myocyte necrosis that led to pump dysfunction and premature death, effects that were dramatically enhanced by acute stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Enhanced Ca2+ influx-induced cellular necrosis and cardiomyopathy was prevented with either LTCC blockers or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, demonstrating a proximal relationship among beta-adrenergic receptor function, Ca2+ handling, and heart failure progression through necrotic cell loss. Mechanistically, loss of cyclophilin D, a regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore that underpins necrosis, blocked Ca2+ influx-induced necrosis of myocytes, heart failure, and isoproterenol-induced premature death. In contrast, overexpression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 was ineffective in mitigating heart failure and death associated with excess Ca2+ influx and acute beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. This paradigm of mitochondrial- and necrosis-dependent heart failure was also observed in other mouse models of disease, which supports the concept that heart failure is a pleiotropic disorder that involves not only apoptosis, but also necrotic loss of myocytes in association with dysregulated Ca2+ handling and beta-adrenergic receptor signaling.",

Recent meta-analyses indicate that, in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, compared with other antihypertensive agents, first-line therapy with beta-blockers was associated with an increased risk of stroke, especially in the elderly cohort with no benefit for the end points of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality. In this review, we critically analyze the evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers in patients with hypertension and evaluate evidence for its role in other indications. The review of the currently available literature shows that in patients with uncomplicated hypertension, there is a paucity of data or absence of evidence to support use of beta-blockers as monotherapy or as first-line agents. Given the increased risk of stroke, their \"pseudo-antihypertensive\" efficacy (failure to lower central aortic pressure), lack of effect on regression of target end organ effects like left ventricular hypertrophy and endothelial dysfunction, and numerous adverse effects, the risk benefit ratio for beta-blockers is not acceptable for this indication.

A significant decline of spermatogenesis in testes due to a decrease in the number of primary, secondary spermatocytes and spermatids in the treatment group 2 (15 mg kg(-1)) is attributed to a significant decrease in testosterone, LH and FSH. Sperm motility and density were also significantly decreased in the cauda epididymis and in the testes of group 2 treated male mice.

To further investigate the mechanisms underlying their clinical effects, we studied their effects on heart rate variability (HRV) and QT-interval variability (QTV). To this end, guinea pigs were treated with either zatebradine (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), diltiazem (40 mg/kg, i.p.) or propranolol (20 mg/kg, i.p.). A dose of each agent that decreased HR by 20-22% was used in this study. HRV and QTV were analyzed by a fast Fourier and/or a wavelet transform algorithm. Zatebradine, an I(f) channel blocker, had no significant effect on HRV and QTV. Diltiazem, a non-dihydropyridine I(CaL) blocker, increased high frequency (HF) power and decreased the power ratio of the low frequency (LF) range to the HF range (L/H) in HRV, and increased QTV. Propranolol, a non-selective beta-antagonist, decreased LF power and L/H ratios in HRV, and appreciably reduced QTV.

Potential factors contributing to longevity in this case are relatively good pulmonary blood flow via large branch pulmonary arteries, and the possible gradual development of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction over a long time period.", 
    "141": "Here we demonstrate that the widely abused drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; \"Ecstasy\") suppresses innate interferon (IFN)-gamma production in mice following an in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. IFN-gamma signalling was also impaired by MDMA, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) and reduced expression of interferon-gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10/CXCL10); a chemokine induced by IFN-gamma. MDMA also suppressed production of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15; two cytokines that induce IFN-gamma production. Our results demonstrate that in vitro exposure to MDMA does not mimic the suppression of innate IFN-gamma observed in vivo, indicating that observed suppression is most likely due to the release of endogenous immunomodulatory substances following drug administration. In this regard, we previously demonstrated that MDMA increases production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in vivo, an event that is mediated by beta-adrenoceptor activation on immune cells. Considering that increased IL-10 production precedes suppression of IFN-gamma induced by MDMA, and also considering that IL-10 can inhibit IL-12 and IFN-gamma production, we examined the possibility that IL-10 was an essential mediator of the suppressive effect of MDMA on the IFN-gamma response. By pre-treating mice with an anti-IL-10 receptor antibody we demonstrate that IL-10 is a critical mediator of MDMA-induced suppression of IFN- gamma production and signalling. Consistent with a role for beta-adrenoceptor activation in the immunosuppressive actions of MDMA, pre-treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol blocked the MDMA-induced increase in IL-10, and also inhibited the suppressive action of MDMA on the innate IFN-gamma response. The potential clinical significance of these findings for MDMA users is discussed.", 
    "142": "Recently, we have shown that protein kinase C (PKC) activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) attenuates the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR)-mediated lipolysis in rat adipocytes. Stimulation of cells by insulin, angiotensin II, and alpha1-AR agonist is known to cause activation of PKC. In this study, we found that lipolysis induced by the beta1-AR agonist dobutamine is decreased and is no longer inhibited by PMA in adipocytes that have been treated with 20 nM insulin for 30 min followed by washing out insulin. Such effects on lipolysis were not found after pretreatment with angiotensin II and alpha1-AR agonists. The rate of lipolysis in the insulin-treated cells was normalized by the PKCalpha- and beta-specific inhibitor G\u00f6 6976 and PKCbeta-specific inhibitor LY 333531. In the insulin-treated cells, wortmannin increased lipolysis and recovered the lipolysis-attenuating effect of PMA. Western blot analysis revealed that insulin slightly increases membrane-bound PKCalpha, betaI, and delta, and wortmannin decreases PKCbetaI, betaII, and delta in the membrane fraction. These results indicate that stimulation of insulin receptor induces a sustained activation of PKC-dependent antilipolysis in rat adipocytes.",

    "147": "Ca2+ antagonists cause dry mouth by inhibiting saliva secretion. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism by which Ca2+ antagonists cause dry mouth. Since the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is closely related to saliva secretion, [Ca2+]i was measured with a video-imaging analysis system by using human submandibular gland (HSG) cells as the material. The Ca2+ antagonist, nifedipine, inhibited the elevation in [Ca2+]i induced by 1-10 microM carbachol (CCh), but had no inhibitory effect on that induced by 30 and 100 microM CCh. The other kinds of Ca2+ antagonists, verapamil (10 microM), diltiazem (10 microM), and the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker, CdCl2 (50 microM), also inhibited the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by 10 microM CCh. The Ca2+ channel activator, Bay K 8644 (5 microM), significantly enhanced the CCh (10 microM)-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. Endothelin-1 and norepinephrine also increased the CCh (10 microM)-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. SKF-96365 reversed the enhancement of the CCh (10 microM)-induced [Ca2+]i elevation caused by AlF4- and phenylephrine. The phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) inhibitor, U-73122 (5 microM), significantly inhibited the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by 100 microM CCh compared with that induced by 10 microM CCh, while the PLCbeta activator, m-3M3FBS (20 microM), significantly increased the [Ca2+]i elevation induced by 100 microM CCh compared with that induced by 10 microM CCh. We therefore conclude that non-selective cation and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are involved in resting salivation and that Ca2+ antagonists depress H2O secretion by blocking the Ca2+ channels and thereby cause dry mouth.",

Antiglaucoma medications act mainly through activation or inhibition of these systems' receptors, helping to decrease aqueous humor production or improve aqueous humor outflow. In this article (part 1) we describe three groups of antiglaucoma medications (beta-antagonists, adrenergic agonists, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors), inhibiting the aqueous humor production and mechanisms of their hypotensive effect in the eye.",

One possible explanation is that atenolol is less effective in reducing central aortic pressure. Newer vasodilating beta-blockers may prove more effective in reducing central pressure and cardiovascular events. Carvedilol and labetalol appear to cause vasodilation through alpha(1)-receptor blockade; nebivolol induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation by stimulating nitric oxide bioactivity. Their favorable hemodynamic profile includes reduction of peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) while maintaining or improving cardiac output (CO), stroke volume, and left ventricular function, whereas nonvasodilating beta-blockers tend to raise PVR and reduce CO and left ventricular function. Compared with conventional beta-blockers, vasodilating beta-blockers have beneficial hemodynamic effects including decreased pressure wave reflection from the periphery, leading to decreases in central aortic blood pressure. Larger trials are needed to determine whether reduced central pressure will translate into improved CV outcomes compared with nonvasodilating beta-blockers.",

Except for unusual, high-risk cases, patients at risk of stroke due to atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis should undergo carotid endarterectomy rather than carotid stenting. Because the technology is still developing, however, carotid stenting may still be appropriate as part of a clinical trial. Although drug-eluting coronary stents reduce the risk of restenosis in the short-term, they pose a small but significant risk of in-stent thrombosis. Clopidogrel (Plavix) should be prescribed for at least a year following drug-eluting stent placement, and perhaps indefinitely.

Enantiomeric resolution was achieved on a vancomycin macrocyclic antibiotic chiral stationary phase (CSP) known as Chirobiotic V with UV detection set at 254 nm. The polar ionic mobile phase (PIM) consisting of methanol-glacial acetic acid-triethylamine (100:0.015:0.010, v/v/v) has been used at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The method is highly specific where other coformulated compounds did not interfere. The stability of bufuralol enantiomers under different degrees of temperature was also studied. The results showed that the drug is stable for at least 7 days at 70 degrees C. The method was validated for its linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness. An experimental design was used during validation to evaluate method robustness. The calibration curves in plasma were linear over the range of 5-500 ng/ml for each enantiomer with detection limit of 2 ng/ml. The mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of the results of within-day precision and accuracy of the drug were <or=10%. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between inter- and intra-day studies for each enantiomer which confirmed the reproducibility of the assay method. The mean extraction efficiency for S-(-)- and R-(+)-bufuralol from plasma was in the range 97-102% at 15-400 ng/ml level for each enantiomer. The overall recoveries of bufuralol enantiomers from pharmaceutical formulations was in the range 99.6-102.2% with %RSD ranging from 1.06 to 1.16%.

    "187": "beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists are the mainstay for the acute symptomatic treatment of asthma and provide effective bronchoprotection to a wide range of bronchoconstrictor agents. However, over the past 4 decades there has been a continuing debate concerning whether regular chronic treatment with these drugs may be doing more harm than good. The FDA's recent decision to add black box warnings concerning the regular use of salmeterol- and formoterol-containing compounds, as well as their decision not to recommend agents containing long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists as first-line therapy, seems to confirm the concerns regarding the regular use of the long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonists. A similar debate arose in the late 1980s concerning the use of beta-adrenoceptor agonists in the treatment of heart failure. In this disease, short-term use of beta agonists is associated with increased cardiac index and stroke volume, yet their long-term use is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Moreover, certain beta blockers that are initially detrimental when used short term are now considered beneficial in the treatment of this disease when used chronically. Here, there is a parallel, as beta blockers are contraindicated in patients with asthma but the use of beta blockers chronically has never been evaluated. This begs the question of whether a similar paradigm shift is applicable in the treatment of asthma and whether under certain circumstances the long-term use of certain beta blockers may be useful in the treatment of this disease.",

    "189": "beta-Blockers are widely used in the prophylaxis of migraine and have been described as very effective drugs in many studies. Some investigators have demonstrated that the clinical improvement of migraine corresponds to the normalization of the contingent negative variation (CNV), a slow cortical potential measuring cortical information processing. However, most of these studies have contained a variety of methodological pitfalls, which we attempted to address in the current study. Twenty patients suffering from migraine without aura were randomly divided into two groups. The groups were treated either with controlled-release metoprolol or placebo for 3 months, using a double-blind design. Twice before and once after each month of the treatment the CNV was recorded. After 3 months, a significant reduction of migraine frequency, duration and intensity was demonstrated for the metoprolol compared with the placebo group. The CNV was characterized by a marked reduction of the amplitude of the total CNV and postimperative negative variation and normalization of the eartly CNV habituation following treatment. Therefore, metoprolol may exert its prophylactic effect in migraine through the influence on cortical information processing and excitability represented by the CNV.",
