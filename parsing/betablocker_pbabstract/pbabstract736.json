    "0": "The clinical effect of the beta-adrenergic blocking drug acebutolol hydrochloride (SECTRAL) was studied in 18 patients with angina pectoris. Ambulatory 24-h ECG monitoring proved to be a useful method for assessing the efficacy of this drug in individual patients in their own daily stresses and environment. Patients were studied in the control state, after two weeks' treatment with placebo, and after two weeks' constant oral dose of the drug. It was found that acebutolol produced a significant decrease in ischemic ST segment depression in patients in whom good beta-blockade was achieved. The drug was less effective in patients in whom the heart rate response to exercise was not suppressed and in those with critical coronary artery obstructions.", 
    "1": "The action of some neurotransmitters and their derivatives on succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase of rat brain mitochondria was studied in vitro. Alpha--adrenoreceptor blocking agents phentolamine and dibenzyline abolished the inhibitory action of the native forms of catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol) on the enzymatic activity under study. Relationships among catecholamines, cyclic 3',5'--AMP, and cortisone in their influence on these enzymes were studied. The data obtained indicate the existence of alpha--type adrenoreceptors in the brain mitochondria which can be responsible for the regulatory influences of catecholamines on functional activity of mitochondria.", 
    "2": "The cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) in the rat during normocapnia and hypercapnia were investigated by means of the intraarterial 133Xenon injection technique; measurements were performed during normocapnia and hypercapnia and the effect of propranolol upon CBF and CMRO2 was studied. The CBF technique applied to rat yield reliable results even in high flow situations. A steady state period of only 10--15 s is all that is necessary to obtain the initial slope of the 133Xenon clearance curve from which CBF is calculated and measurements may be repeated within minutes. Hypercapnia caused an increase in CMRO2 of 35% which confirms the findings of other investigators. The beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol (2 mg per kg i.v.) prevented this increase and could eliminate an increase in CMRO2 already induced; this indicates that CO2 affects adrenergic mechanisms. Although propranolol eliminated the CMRO2 response to hypercapnia, it only reduced the CBF response; this dissociation of CBF and CMRO2 response occurred probably because the beta-receptor blockage only eliminated a CBF increase mediated through an increased CMRO2 (cellular response) whereas a direct CO2 effect upon the arterioles (vascular response) persisted.", 
    "3": "The effect of propranolol on the function of the heart, its hemodynamics and metabolism was studied on dogs and rats. It was established that propranolol-induced block of the beta-adrenergic receptors is conducive to a decrease in the intensity of myocardial metabolism and increase of myocardial tolerance to ischemia.", 
    "4": "It is unclear what factors control the secretion of pulmonary surface active material from alveolar type II cells in vivo. Other workers have suggested that cholinergic stimuli, adrenergic stimuli, and prostaglandins may all stimulate secretion. We isolated type II cells from the lungs of rats by treatment with elastase, discontinuous density centrifugation, and adherence in primary culture. beta-Adrenergic agonists, but not cholinergic agonists, caused an increase in the release of [(14)C]disaturated phosphatidylcholine, the major component of surface-active material, from type II cells in culture. The beta-adrenergic effect was stereo-selective, (-)-isoproterenol being 50 times more potent than (+)-isoproterenol. Terbutaline, 10 muM, a noncatecholamine beta-2 adrenergic agonist, caused a release of 2.0+/-0.5 (mean+/-SD) times the basal release of [(14)C]disaturated phosphatidylcholine in 3 h; the concentration of terbutaline causing half maximal stimulation was 800 nM. The terbutaline effect was blocked by propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist (calculated K(d) = 6 nM), but not by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. Isobutylmethylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and 8-Br cyclic AMP, but not 8-Br cyclic guanosine monophosphate, also stimulated release. We conclude that type II cells secrete disaturated phosphatidylcholine in response to treatment with adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "5": "1. The central hypotensive activity of (+)- and (-)-propranolol (100 microgram), pindolol (100 microgram) and isoprenaline (1 and 4 microgram) injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) was studied in rats anaesthetized with urethane and chloralose. Blood pressure, cardiac output and heart rate were measured; systolic stroke volume and peripheral vascular resistance were calculated. 2. (+)- and (-)-Propranolol and pindolol induced a fall of blood pressure but (+)-propranolol was less active. The heart rate was reduced more by (-)-propranolol than by (+)-propranolol or (-)-pindolol. The decrease of systolic stroke volume was greater for (-)-propranolol and pindolol than for (+)-propranolol. Peripheral vascular resistance was reduced to the same level but with different time courses, (-)-propranolol having a longer effect than (+)-propranolol and pindolol. 3. Isoprenaline induced a hypotensive effect, while cardiac output and heart rate increased; the systolic stroke volume remained stable but peripheral vascular resistance was significantly decreased. 4. These results suggest that different central regulatory centres are involved in the control of cardiac function and peripheral vascular tone.", 
    "6": "1. Stimulation of the hypogastric nerves increased the pressure in both the bladder and urethra of anaesthetized female dogs. 2. The responses were reduced but not abolished by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol was either without effect or increased the responses. Atropine, methysergide and hexamethonium were without effect. 3. Close arterial injection of phenylephrine increased and isoprenaline decreased urethral pressure but both produced only a slight increase in bladder pressure. 4. Hypogastric nerve stimulation reduced subsequent responses of the bladder and urethra to pelvic nerve stimulation or to close arterial injection of acetylcholine. Isoprenaline, but not phenylephrine, also had an inhibitory action and 5-hydroxytryptamine enhanced the responses. 5. In the presence of hexamethonium the inhibitory action of isoprenaline still occurred but 5-hydroxytryptamine no longer enhanced the responses, suggesting that 5-hydroxytryptamine acts on the ganglia and isoprenaline acts, at least partially, on smooth muscle. 6. These results suggest that the role of the hypogastric nerves may be to modify inputs to the bladder and urethra as well as to act directly on the smooth muscle.", 
    "7": "Three beta-adrenoblockers (trasicor, alpheprol, isoptin) were used in 68 patients with thyrotoxicosis in the complex therapy of the disease. Their effect on hemodynamic indices, urinary catecholamine excretion were studied, and the results of investigation were compared with the data obtained earlier with the use of anaprylin. The action of the latter on the thyroid metabolism was ascertained. Anaprylin proved to be the most effective of the aforementioned preparations. Trasicor, which was somewhat less effective, could be used in patients with thyrotoxicosis complicated by cardiovascular insufficiency due to its less pronounced inotropic action. Isoptin may be recommended as an anti-arrhythmic agent in thyrotoxicosis. The action mechanism of beta-adrenoblockers in thyrotoxicosis is suggested.", 
    "8": "The effect of calculation stress on hemodynamic parameters and plasma adrenalin and noradrenalin was studied in two groups of 6 male subjects, before and during beta-Blockade. One group received propranolol 15 mg i.v. and the other received mepindolol sulphate 0,5 mg i.v. There was an increase in heart rate, cardiac output and blood pressure during mental stress. A significant increase in plasma adrenalin but not in noradrenalin occurred at the same time. The stress-induced rise in HR but not that in blood pressure could be prevented by beta-receptor blockage with propranolol and mepindolol sulfate. The peripheral resistance (PR) and diastolic blood pressure in stress were even higher after propranolol than in the control study. Propranolol had no effect on the increased adrenalin concentration during stress, but it was prevented by mepindolol sulfate. There was no correlation between the increase in HR and that in adrenalin during stress, but the HR in stress and the HR reaction to infused isoproterenol were highly correlated.", 
    "9": "Administration of triiodothyronine to thyroidectomized rats increased the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in rat submaxillary gland without significantly changing the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Thus, thyroid hormone appears to regulate beta-adrenergic sensitivity in the rat salivary gland.", 
    "10": "The haemodynamic effects of the selective beta1-adrenoceptor agonist prenalterol were studied in healthy subjects before and after therapeutic doses of the selective beta1-adrenoceptor blocker metoprolol. Plasma levels of the drugs were also determined in order to calculate certain pharmacokinetic variables. Intravenous infusion of prenalterol 0.13, 0.25 and 0.50 mg induced a dose-dependent decrease in total electromechanical systole (QA2) and pre-ejection period (PEP). The effect on left ventricular ejection time (LVET) was not significant. Increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were dose-dependent. Diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly. When metoprolol had been administered in a cumulative dose of 150 mg (mean maximal plasma level, 284 nmol/l) prenalterol had to be administered in doses that were twelve times higher than before the beta-blocker in order to induce the same haemodynamic effects. Prenalterol was rapidly distributed with an average half life of 8 min. This indicates that distribution equilibrium will be achieved within 30 min after intravenous administration. The overall elimination rate in the post-distributive phase corresponded to an average half life of 2.0 h.", 
    "11": "The frequency of heterozygotes of recessive generalized myotonia may be estimated at about 1/108 in the German Federal Republic. Some heterozygotes can be identified by an EMG. However, apart from this, apparently 2%--5% of heterozygotes may show minor subclinical manifestations. Sporadic cases of myotonia with late onset and a history of preceding, extremely prolonged physical stress, undernourishment, and/or prolonged cold exposure may be due to heterozygote manifestations of this otherwise recessive gene. Late onset and sporadic appearance also are features in patients with myotonia associated with hypothyroidism. One male patient displayed myotonia after a protracted diabetic coma. In cases reported in the literature where myotonia developed in association with either propranolol (beta-adrenergic blocking agent) or fenoterolhydrobromide (stimulator of beta receptors) heterozygote manifestation of recessive generalized myotonia is suggested.", 
    "12": "The pharmacokinetics of pindolol were determined in 12 hypertensive African subjects after a single oral dose of the drug. The estimated pharmacokinetic parameters do not differ significantly in Africans from the values which have been obtained in other races.", 
    "13": "Isolated lung strips of guinea pigs were examined as an in vitro model for assessing the direct effect of beta-adrenergic drugs at the level of peripheral airways. Changes in intrinsic tone of thin strips of lung parenchyma were measured with an isometric force transducer. Isoproterenol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist, and several beta-adrenergic agonists, soterenol, salbutamol, metaproterenol and ritodrine elicited a dose-related relaxation of lung strip. Responses to isoproterenol were antagonized by propranolol and the selective beta blocking agents butoxamine (beta2) and practolol (beta1). These results were compared to data obtained with the same compounds on isolated guinea pig atria. All agonists except ritodrine were full agonists in the lung strip whereas isoproterenol and metaproterenol were the only full agonists in the atrial preparation. In the atria, practolol was a more effective blocker of isoproterenol responses than butoxamine, and the reverse was true for the lung strip.", 
    "14": "A retrospective study made of 114 cases of renovascular hypertension was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of different types of treatment. In this series, with a follow-up of 18 months to 9 years, a favourable result with regard to blood pressure was obtained in 45% of cases with surgery, in 63% of cases with medical treatment and in 88% of cases if treatment included beta-blockers. Medical treatment represents a valid alternative to surgery in hypertension of this type, regardless of the amount of renin secretion and whatever the criteria of ischaemia. The choice of surgery as a method of treatment thus depends above all upon the age of patient, the type of stenosis and the anatomical risk represented by the vascular malformation. Despite the very spectacular results of medical treatment, it remains essential to seek a renal cause for hypertension, since many renal conditions which require specific treatment present with hypertension alone.", 
    "15": "A single-blind clinical trial compared step 2 combination therapy consisting of 50 or 100 mg of hydroflumethiazide plus either 0.125 to 0.250 mg of reserpine, 500 to 2,000 mg of methyldopa, or 80 to 320 mg of propranolol hydrochloride, in 59 patients whose elevated blood pressure (BP) failed to respond adequately to the thiazide alone. After nine weeks of treatment, diastolic BP was reduced below 90 mm Hg in all 20 patients treated with the reserpine-hydroflumethiazide combination, in 13 of the 19 patients treated with methyldopa and hydroflumethiazide, and in 16 of the 20 patients treated with propranolol and hydroflumethiazide. Changes in laboratory values were not substantial; adverse reactions occurred only in the methyldopa group. Although the three treatment regimens were similar with respect to safety and efficacy, the reserpine-hydroflumethiazide combination offers the advantages of more convenient dosage at lower cost.", 
    "16": "The ability of central catecholaminergic neurons to grow into and establish functional connections with the hippocampus in vitro was studied using organotypic tissue culture. Brain stem explanted from the region of the locus coeruleus and hippocampal explants, from 18-day fetal mice, were maintained as co-cultures and were also grown separately. After 1-4 weeks these tissues were analyzed by glyoxylic acid-induced histofluorescence, by light and electron microscopic radioautography after incubation with [3H]norepinephrine, and by electrophysiology. Brain stem explants exhibited specifically fluorescent catecholaminergic cell bodies and varicose fibers after 2-4 weeks in culture. In contrast, no fluorescent cells or neurites could be seen in isolated hippocampal cultures grown for 2-3 weeks in vitro. When hippocampal explants were grown near brain stem explants, catecholaminergic fibers grew out of the brain stem and entered the hippocampus. In additional experiments, co-cultures of brain stem and hippocampus were incubated with [3H]norepinephrine (0.5 micron) and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor nialamide (100 micron). Radioautographic analyses revealed that brain stem neurites which entered the hippocampus took up norepinephrine, whereas neurites in the isolated hippocampal explants did not. Electron microscopic studies of the hippocampus showed varicose axon terminals within the hippocampus to be preferentially labeled. Although close relationships could be seen between labeled axons and dendrites, junctions exhibiting the membranous modifications associated with synapses were never seen. Electrophysiological studies suggested that the catecholaminergic neurites within the hippocampus were functional. Complex synaptically mediated slow wave discharges could be evoked by electrical stimuli in isolated hippocampal explants. Introduction of the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol (0.4-4.3 micron) did not alter, or slightly depressed, these hippocampal discharges. On the other hand, in hippocampus-brain stem co-cultures, these concentrations of propranolol enhanced the complex hippocampal responses to brain stem or hippocampal stimuli. Similar enhancement of hippocampal responses by propranolol also occurred in these cocultures after acute surgical extirpation of the brain stem explant. The data suggest, therefore, that the action of propranol was probably to block adrenergic inhibitory connections with hippocampal synaptic networks. These experiments provide morphological and electrophysiological evidence that catecholaminergic neurons from fetal mouse brain stem maintained in organotypic tissue culture can grow into and functionally innervate the hippocampus.", 
    "17": "Two adults with Bartter's syndrome were treated first with propranolol and a potassium-sparing diuretic and then with indomethacin for 22 months. Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by indomethacin, confirmed by a fall in urinary excretion rate of prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha, induced a marked decrease in plasma renin activity and aldosterone excretion rate and an increase in plasma potassium. While the first patient was well controlled by this therapy, the second had elevation of prostaglandin excretion after 8 months associated with a relapse of symptomatic hypokalemia. Reintroduction of propranolol in addition to indomethacin led to renormalization of plasma potassium. A therapeutic trial with another prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, meclofenamate, also produced partial correction of hyperreninemia and hypokalemia but only for a short time. From these observations it is concluded that (1) inhibition of renal prostaglandins by indomethacin or meclofenamate represents an effective but transient therapy for Bartter's syndrome, and (2) while prostaglandin secretion may elude pharmacological inhibition, the addition of propranolol restores complete inhibition and the therapeutic benefits of the previous treatment.", 
    "18": "1 The rectum isolated from the fowl was perfused with Tyrode solution via the caudal mesenteric artery. Noradrenaline and adrenaline were biologically or fluorimetrically assayed in perfusates collected before and during stimulation of Remak's nerve or of the periarterial nerves.2 Perfusates collected during nerve stimulation relaxed the chick rectum and rat stomach strips which served as assay tissues. This effect was attributed to the action of noradrenaline or adrenaline released from adrenergic nerve endings which appeared in the perfusates.3 Perfusates obtained during stimulation (30 Hz for 60 s) of Remak's nerve contained both noradrenaline and adrenaline when measured fluorimetrically. The mean output per stimulus train was 0.8 +/- 0.2 ng/g wet wt. tissue for noradrenaline and 1.7 +/- 0.2 ng/g wet wt. tissue for adrenaline (n = 7). Perfusates obtained during stimulation (30 Hz for 60 s) of the periarterial nerves contained noradrenaline in a concentration of 1.6 +/- 0.3 ng/g wet wt. tissue per stimulus train, but almost no adrenaline (n = 7).4 Neither stimulation of Remak's nerve nor the periarterial nerves liberated catecholamines when the rectum was perfused with Tyrode solution containing low Ca(2+) (0.1 mM) and high Mg(2+) (10 mM).5 Infusion of high potassium solution (50 mM) increased markedly the output of noradrenaline and adrenaline.6 Adrenaline as well as noradrenaline may function as the adrenergic neurotransmitter in the rectum of the fowl.", 
    "19": "1 beta-adrenoceptor blockade with metoprolol provoked, both at rest and during exercise, a decrease of 'active' renin and angiotensin II together with an increase of 'inactive' renin and unchanged 'total' renin. The significant exercise-provoked increases in angiotensin II, plasma renin activity and 'active', 'inactive' and 'total' renin when on placebo, were reduced by metoprolol. 2 No significant change in serum sodium and potassium and in plasma aldosterone was found during beta-adrenoceptor blockade at rest. During exercise plasma aldosterone dropped significantly without any change in serum sodium or potassium. 3 Plasma noradrenaline increased significantly at rest on metoprolol. The increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline during exercise was similar on placebo and on metoprolol.", 
    "20": "1 Labetalol caused a fall in blood pressure within 2 h or oral doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg in six hypertensive patients. 2 This fall which was dose-related was maximal by 3 h and was sustained when the drug was given in doses of 100 mg 8 hourly, 200 mg 8 hourly and 400 mg 8 hourly. 3 This rapid fall in pressure when labetalol is given by mouth which contrasts to that seen on administration of pure beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents is a valuable therapeutic property.", 
    "21": "The haemodynamic effects of the antiarrhythmic compound, QX 572, have been studied in anaesthetized cats. It was found that QX 572 increased the heart rate and decreased the blood pressure of the cats during the infusion of the drug. A slight increase in blood pressure was seen after the infusion was terminated. The same results have been obtained in patients. Experiments on cats pretreated with propranolol or reserpine showed that infusions of QX 572 caused an increase in heart rate by increasing the sympathetic activity in the cats. It is also shown that changes in vagal tone may contribute to the effects of QX 572 on the heart rate.", 
    "22": "Hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease may be treated very effectively by antithyroid pills, such as PTU and Tapazole, by radioactive iodine therapy, and by subtotal thyroidectomy. Each form of therapy has advantages and disadvantages, and thus treatment should be individualized. While therapy with radioactive iodine would appear to be ideal since it does not require an operation and is less expensive than surgical management, it suffers from a high rate of progressive hypothyroidism and from the fact that the time until a euthyroid state is obtained is often prolonged. In addition, the long-term carcinogenic risk of the therapy for thyroid neoplasia has never been completely defined since the data most often quoted have a mean follow-up time of only eight years. Furthermore, new \"low-dose\" radioiodine regimens may be more dangerous in this regard. Subtotal thyroidectomy, while not totally without complications, remains a rapid, safe, and effective treatment for Graves' disease. The careful use of propranolol has facilitated the preparation of some patients and has lessened the risk of operation. Thyroidectomy should remain the treatment of choice for young adults with this disease.", 
    "23": "Effects of stimulation of the locus coeruleus (LC) on evoked potential in the medial amygdala elicited by stimulation of the olfactory bulb (OB-AME potentials) were studied in the gallamine-immobilized rats. The amplitude of the OB-AME potential was inhibited 27.5% by the conditioning stimulation of LC delivered 30 msec before the test stimulation. The inhibitory effect of LC was reduced by propranolol 5 mg/kg i.p., but not by phentolamine 10 mg/kg i.p.. This effect was also reduced by tetrabenazine 10 mg/kg i.p.. Methamphetamine 5 mg/kg i.p. produced considerable potentiation of the LC inhibitory effect and a reduction of the OB-AME potential itself. These results suggest that the LC plays an inhibitory role in the electrical activity of the medial amygdala.", 
    "24": "Carteolol was orally administered to mice once a day at doses of 3, 30 and 150 mg/kg/day during the perinatal and lactation periods and evaluated on its adverse effects on pregnant animals and their offspring. No appreciably abnormal findings related to the drug administration were revealed. Therefore, it was concluded that carteolol have no serious toxic potential on parturition and lactation by mother animals, no adverse effects on growth and development, and behavioral and reproductive performance of offspring and no carcinogenic action through placental and milk transfer.", 
    "25": "Carteolol was administered orally by gastric intubation at 3, 15, 75 or 150 mg/kg/day to ICR-JCL mice of both sexes prior to mating and to females during early stage of pregnancy to determine its effects on the entire reproductive process and fetal development. Following results were obtained: 1) The decrease of spontaneous motor activity was observed in all treatment groups, and some animals in the 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg groups pressed the chest or abdomen against the cage wall. 2) The incidence of early resorptions in the 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg groups was significantly higher than that in controls.3) The ossification of the talus and calcaneus was significantly retarded in the 75 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg groups. The maximum non-effective dose on fertility and reproduction for carteolol was estimated to be 15 mg/kg/day, although the incidence of early resorptions was slightly elevated with this dose.", 
    "26": "1. The role of baroreceptors in the cardiovascular mechanism of action of DL-propranolol has been studied by comparing the acute effects of subcutaneous injection of 1 and 5 mg/kg (3.3 x 10(-6) and 16.5 x 10(-6) mol/kg) of this drug in conscious baroreceptor-denervated spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats with those in sham-operated control SH rats. 2. At 5 mg/kg (16.5 x 10(-6) mol/kg) propranolol caused a small, but significant, increase in blood pressure in sham-operated SH rats, whereas both after 1 and 5 mg/kg (3.3 x 10(-6) and 16.5 x 10(-6) mol/kg) immediate hypotension was observed in baroreceptor-denervated animals. 3. Heart rate dropped rapidly after injection of 1 or 5 mg/kg (3.3 x 10(-6) and 16.5 x 10(-6) mol/kg) propranolol both in the baroreceptor-denervated and sham-operated SH rats. Bradycardia was significantly larger in the baroreceptor-denervated animals after an injection of 5 mg/kg (16.5 x 10(-6) mol/kg). 4. It is concluded that the lack of an early hypotensive effect of propranolol in intact animals is caused by an increased baroreceptor reflex activity as a consequence of the fall in cardiac output.", 
    "27": "1. In eight patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and six patients with renovascular hypertension (RVHT) peripheral venous enzymatically active and inactive renin values were followed after acute stimulation of renin release by the vasodilating agent diazoxide (300 mg intravenously). Active renin rose during the first hour after diazoxide and remained high during the following 15 h, but inactive renin fell during the first hour and rose thereafter. Peripheral venous active and inactive renin were not different from arterial values both before and after diazoxide. 2. Sixteen patients with EHT received propranolol, 80 mg, four times a day. Six of them had a first injection of diazoxide the day before propranolol was started and a second one after 10--14 days of propranolol treatment. Peripheral vein active renin was lowered by propranolol, but inactive renin was raised. Both the diazoxide-induced rapid rise of active renin and the fall of inactive renin observed in untreated patients were absent during treatment with propranolol. 3. In four patients with EHT and seven patients with RVHT renal vein sampling was performed before and 30 min after diazoxide. Increased release of active renin from kidneys that were not markedly contracted was associated with a fall of the renal vein to peripheral vein ratio of inactive renin to a value less than one. 4. It is concluded that under certain circumstances stimulated release of active renin is associated with removal of inactive renin from the circulation by the kidney. This may in fact be due to intrarenal transformation of circulating inactive renin into its active counterpart. The findings suggest that a beta-adrenoreceptor might be involved in this activation process.", 
    "28": "Effects of a single intravenous dose of propranolol (0,25 mg/kg body weight) were examined in 15 healthy male subjects who performed three reaction-time tasks of different complexity, while pedalling at five work loads on a cycle ergometer. Comparisons between measurements after propranolol and after injection of a placebo solution showed a pronounced reduction of heart rate and an increase in catecholamine excretion following propranolol. Comparisons of psychomotor performance showed no significan difference between the propranolol and placebo conditions. Nor did self-estimates of perceived physical and task-induced efforts reveal any significant effects of propranolol. The results support the notion that heart rate is not a prominent cue for perceived effort.", 
    "29": "A method for the quantitative determination of naphthoxylactic acid and naphthoxyacetic acid, two acidic metabolites of propranolol, in human plasma is described. Preliminary data from hypertensive patients receiving chronic propranolol therapy and from normal volunteers who took a single 80 mg oral propranolol dose revealed that naphthoxylactic acid plasma levels were 4 to 20 times that of propranolol whereas naphthoxyacetic acid levels were equivalent to or less than the plasma concentrations of propranolol.", 
    "30": "The carbachol contracted rabbit trachea relaxes to isoproterenol, PGE1, E2, histamine and bradykinin. Histamine-induced relaxations were resistant to mepyramine (an H1-antagonist), burimamide, cimetidine, metiamide (H2-antagonists), propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker), indomethacin (a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis), trasylol (an inhibitor of kallikreins), aminophylline (a purinergic receptor blocker) and dibenzyline (a \"D\"-tryptamine receptor antagonist). The evidence achieved with these pharmacological agents appears to suggest that the chemical mediator responsible for the relaxant response to histamine is unlikely to be: catecholamines, prostaglandins, 5-HT, adenosine or ATP or kinins. The existence of H2-(iso or H3) histamine receptor subtype in rabbit trachea is postulated.", 
    "31": "Twenty one patients with either paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (group A), atrial flutter (group B), or atrial fibrillation (group C) were treated with intravenous metoprolol in the dose range 2--20 mg. Sinus rhythm was restored in 3 out of 6 patients in group A, 3 out of 7 patients in group B and one out of 8 patients in group C. In patients who did not convert to sinus rhythm a remarkable decrease in ventricular rate occurred in 3 patients with atrial flutter and 4 patients with atrial fibrillation. In patients with systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg but without an acute myocardial infarction the risk of hypotension necessitating treatment was small. Metoprolol appears to be an effective and safe drug in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "32": "Seventeen hypertensive out-patients, more or less unresponsive to previous treatment with antihypertensive drugs, were treated in a cross-over fashion with placebo, prazosin (Pz), methyldopa (MD), Pz + MD, Pz + clonidine (C) and Pz + propranolol. The antihypertensive responses to Pz 2 mg t.i.d. and MD 250 mg t.i.d. were poor, and only modest when the drugs were combined. The combination of Pz with low doses of C was about as effective as Pz + MD, and some patients failed to respond to it. Nor was the combination of Pz + propranolol effective in those cases but the addition of a diuretic produced good responses in all patients. Side effects were few. It is concluded that a combination of central and peripheral sympathetic blockade does not necessarily produce normotension, and that a diuretic added to this combination greatly improves the response.", 
    "33": "A clinical study with Bupranolol (Ophtorenin), a beta adrenergic blocking agent, is presented. 85 eyes with kinds species of glaucoma were treated during 22 months. A satisfying hypotensive effect was attained in a high percentage. Suitable combinations with Clonidine and Acetazolamide were tested. Based on its atoxic properties and lack of adverse reactions Bupranolol represents a valuable enlargement of glaucoma therapy.", 
    "34": "Phencyclidine (PCP) is a potent sympathomimetic and hallucinogenic dissociative anesthetic agent. As an abused street drug, it is most often smoked, thus allowing the user to titrate the dose. The clinical signs of PCP intoxication can be viewed in three dose-related stages, but waxing and waning of signs through the three stages is not uncommon. Treatment protocols for each stage address drug therapy and both clinical and psychological supportive measures.", 
    "35": "The aim of this study was to explain the unresponsiveness of rabbit perirenal adipose tissue to epinephrine. The in vitro lipolytic response to isoproterenol and to epinephrine alone or associated with alpha- or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, was studied in the adipocytes of rabbits of various ages. Epinephrine induces a large glycerol release in young rabbit adipocytes whereas an increase in the rate of lipolysis cannot be shown with adult rabbit fat cells. Moreover, an antilipolytic effect can be shown for low concentrations of epinephrine when the basal rate of lipolysis is high in older rabbit adipocytes. Isoproterenol (beta-adrenomimetic) always exerts a strong adipokinetic effect, thus revealing functional beta-receptor sites. The blockade of alpha-adreneoceptor sites by phentolamine, which has no effect on young rabbits, abolishes the antilipolytic effect and unmasks strong lipolytic effect of epinephrine on aged and normal rabbit adipocytes. The loss of beta-adrenergic responsiveness towards epinephrine in the aging rabbit is linked to the involvement of an increased alpha-adrenergic responsiveness. The stimulation of alpha receptor sites by epinephrine leads to a depressive effect on lipolysis (lack of adipokinetic effect or antilipolytic action).", 
    "36": "1. After oral administration of alprenolol to rat, 12 metabolites were isolated and characterized as trifluoroacetyl, trimethylsilyl and n-butylboronate derivatives, using a g.l.c.-mass spectrometry-computer system. Fragmentation pathways of derivatives in the mass-spectrometric analysis are discussed. 2. Metabolic reactions involved are oxidative degradation of the propanolisopropylamine side-chain, aromatic hydroxylation, oxidation of the allyl group, and conjugation. A method for direct analysis of epoxide functions in the allyl group is described. 3. In comparison with metabolism of alprenolol in vitro, more polar metabolites are formed in vivo but the same principal metabolic pathways are valid. Structural features for biliary excretion are discussed.", 
    "37": "1. Metabolites of alprenolol were isolated and identified in dog, guinea-pig and rat liver microsomes by means of g.l.c.-mass spectrometry and comparison with synthetic reference compounds. 2. The compounds were chromatographed as n-butylboronate derivatives, giving a series of diagnostic ions in the mass spectral fragmentation, which was elucidated by using stable isotopes. 3. Alprenolol was metabolized by aromatic ring hydroxylation, oxidation of the allylic function, and degradation of the isopropylaminopropanol side-chain. Alprenolol and four metabolites were quantified by h.p.l.c. and batch extraction techniques based on radioactivity measurements. 4. Five metabolites were detected in rat and guinea-pig liver microsomes and four in the dog. A species variation in the biotransformation of the allyl function in alprenolol was observed. The metabolite formed by oxidation of the allyl double bond was detected in significant amounts in the guinea-pig, and was also formed in the rat but could not be detected in dog liver microsomes.", 
    "38": "1. Mongrel dogs were anaesthetized with chloralose, paralysed, ventilated and vagotomized and given a beta-blocking drug, sotalol, in sufficient doses to block the effects of 5 microgram of adrenaline. 2. Changes in inspired CO2 concentration were produced, causing increases of arterial PCO2 up to 120 mmHg. The effects on myocardial blood flow were measured with radioactive microspheres. Coronary sinus and arterial blood was sampled. 3. In the absence of beta-blockade, an increase in arterial PCO2 produced variable effects. In some dogs coronary blood flow increased, while in others there was no change. There was a mean increase in coronary blood flow at arterial PCO2 values above 85 mmHg which was abolished by beta-blockade. 4. In the presence of beta-blockade, an increase of arterial PCO2 produced depression of left ventricular performance, i.e. a fall of maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure and a rise of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. 5. In the presence of beta-blockade, there were no consistent changes in myocardial blood flow, left ventricular pressure or cardiac output. 6. In the absence of beta-blockade, coronary arterial minus venous ocygen content was reduced by hypercapnia. In the presence of beta-blockade, the changes were small and not statistically significant. The direct coronary vasodilator effect was therfore negligible. 7. It is concluded that the previously reported hypercapnic vasodilatation was mainly an effect of sympatho-adrenergic stimulation by hypercapnia. 8. In the presence of beta-blockade, coronary sinus PO2 increased markedly, with little change in coronary sinus oxygen content; this was consistent with a shift to the right of the oxy-haemoglobin dissociation curve. Under circumstances of hypercapnia, a rise in coronary sinus (and presumably tissue) PO2 failed to produce vasoconstriction. 9. It is argued that the vasodilator effect of hydrogen ions and the vasoconstrictor effect of oxygen probably cancel one another when the arterial PCO2 is raised.", 
    "39": "We used ultrastructural morphometric methods to study the in vivo regulation of secretion in bronchiolar Clara cells of rats. The Clara cells studied were located in airways with an internal diameter of 0.21 +/- 0.06 mm (mean +/- SD) at a transpulmonary pressure of 20 cm H2O. We found that pilocarpine caused a 50% decrease in the volume density of secretory granules of Clara cells in 60 min and that atropine blocked this effect. Isoproterenol produced a similar fall in volume density and this was blocked by propranolol. Propranolol also blocked the effect of pilocarpine. The fall in volume density of the secretory granules produced by pilocarpine and by isoproterenol occurred without any change in the surface-to-volume ratio of the granules. This indicates the change in volume density reflected a decrease in number rather than in size of the secretory granules. The observation that propranolol blocks the secretory response to pilocarpine as well as the response to isoproterenol suggests a dual in series cholinergic adrenergic regulation of secretion in bronchiolar Clara cells in rats.", 
    "40": "Whisky (25-50 ml) increased plasma levels of immunoreactive calcitonin (iCT) in seventeen of nineteen patients with chronic renal failure. The effect was greater in patients with high levels of iCT than in those with normal levels. Changes in plasma iCT were not related to changes in calcium, phosphate or immunoreactive gastrin, but were inhibited by the prior administration of propranolol.", 
    "41": "In a hypertensive patient with orthostatic hypotension, the changes in several haemodynamic indices with respect to posture were evaluated. In the upright position, systemic blood pressure was reduced as compared with the supine position, and peripheral vasodilation was present, as shown by an increase in Jantsch's index of the impedance plethysmographic tracings. Systolic time intervals remained unchanged with changes in posture. Propranolol 10 mg intravenously brought the response to normal. In fact, after beta-blockade in the standing position the blood pressure remained unchanged and normal peripheral vasoconstriction was observed. Similar results were seen during atrial pacing at a constant heart rate of 130 beats/minute. In this patient, propranolol appears to normalise the response to the posture change, by restoring normal vasoconstriction in the upright position.", 
    "42": "T wave and ST segment abnormalities in 20 asymptomatic men aged 18 to 55 were investigated because they were identical with myocardial ischaemic changes, and the professional livelihood of the subjects was jeopardised. Coronary arteriograms showed unobstructed arteries in all except one in whom a 50 per cent lesion of the left anterior descending artery was present. Left ventricular angiograms showed a normal contraction pattern, Ejection fractions were normal in 12 and increased in 8. Three characteristic electrocardiographic patterns were observed: flat or inverted T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V4 to 6 designated type 1; deep T inversion particularly evident in leads V2 to 5 designated type 2, and minor ST segment depression in the inferior and lateral leads without T changes designated type 3. Characteristically, type 1 changes were temporarily suppressed by either beta-blockade or an overnight rest and were more abnormal in the standing position. Type 2 and 3 changes were relatively uninfluenced by these manoeuvres. Maximal treadmill exercise tests were positive in 6 and borderline or negative in 14. When repeated after oxprenolol all tests were negative. Echocardiograms showed asymmetric septal hypertrophy in 3 subjects (ratio of greater than 1.5 between ventricular septum and posterior left ventricular wall). After normalisation by an overnight rest, type 1 T wave abnormalities were reproduced by intravenous adrenaline infusion (0.024 to 0.18 microgram/kg/min) but not by noradrenaline or by adrenaline after prior administration of oxprenolol. When the T waves had remained deeply inverted before infusion despite rest (type 2) adrenaline infusion normalised them and again noradrenaline was without effect. This effect was also prevented by oxprenolol. Type 3 changes were uninfluenced by catecholamine infusion. Plasma catecholamine estimations suggest that catecholamine hypersecretion and hypersensitivity may both be relevant, particularly the latter. The apparent bimodal response of the ventricular myocardium to adrenaline infusion is not surprising since in vitro experiments suggest that reversal of T wave polarity in either direction may result from summation of changes in action potential duration in different parts of the heart. Such changes may be unimodal, that is both areas involved show lengthening or shortening of action potential duration, but by occurring at different rates may lead to a bimodal change in the differences in duration which generate the T wave.", 
    "43": "The time course of the blockade effect of propranolol on the sinus node (SN) and the atrioventricular node (AVN) was studied in six normal volunteers. Serial isoproterenol infusions were done before and after oral propranolol administration, 160 mg daily for two days. The inhibition by propranolol of the heart rate increases due to isoproterenol was used to assess the blockade of the sinus node, and the diminution by propranolol of the shortening in the PR interval due to isoproterenol was used to assess the blockade of the atrioventricular node. The blockade effects on the sinus node and the atrioventricular node were identical and persisted more than 24 hours. There was no good relationship between plasma propranolol and blockade effect on sinus node and/or atrioventricular node as propranolol was no longer detectable in the plasma 24 hours after the last dose. A transient hypersensitivity to isoproterenol was present 36 to 48 hours after propranolol withdrawal. The explanation of these phenomena most likely lies in the peculiar nature of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "44": "Seventeen outpatients suffering from essential hypertension were treated in a double-blind cross-over study with labetalol or with a combination of propranolol and dihydrallazine. The doses were increased depending on the response during the six week treatment periods. Both treatments reduced the blood pressure significantly as compared to the placebo, and the combination more than labetalol with the doses used, apparently because of a higher degree of the beta-blockade. Positive linear correlations were found between the dose of labetalol and the concentration in plasma as well as the concentration of labetalol in plasma and the decrease of standing blood pressures.", 
    "45": "The effect of several drugs presumably influencing central catecholaminergic receptors on plasma cortisol and GH response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia was studied in healthy adult males. The intravenous infusion of alpha-adrenergic blocking agents tolazoline or phentolamine supressed plasma cortisol and GH response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. After an infusion of beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol both hypoglycemia and rise in plasma cortisol and GH were prolonged. Finally, the administration of dopaminergic blocker pimozide failed to affect the plasma cortisol response, but slightly suppressed the enhancement of GH release during hypoglycemia. Caution is recommended before making suggestions about neuroendocrine regulations from the data obtained after systemic administration of drugs. Nevertheless, it may be concluded that the hypothesis on the inhibitory role of the central alpha-adrenergic system on ACTH secretion suggested in rats and dogs was not confirmed by our results obtained in man.", 
    "46": "The effects of smoking and inhalation of carbon monoxide on the systolic time intervals and blood pressure were examined in ten healthy smokers with a mean age of 24.3 years. Each subject smoked a low-nicotine cigarette with a ventilated filter (0.1 mg nicotine, 1.1 vol percent CO), and a high-nicotine plain cigarette (2.6 mg nicotine, 4.5 vol percent CO), as well as a cigar in random sequence and in a standardized way. Cigar smoke was not inhaled. The product heart rate x blood pressure was increased and the left ventricular ejection time index (LVETc) prolonged following smoking the high-nicotine cigarette, whereas changes after smoking the low-nicotine cigarette and the cigar were not as pronounced. These changes are presumably caused by nicotine-induced catecholamine release. Inhalation of CO did not affect cardiac performance acutely as shown by unchanged systolic time intervals. When a high-nicotine cigarette was smoked after the subject received a beta blocker, a significant prolongation of the pre-ejection period index (PEPc) occurred as a result of the increased afterload. Thus, the effects of catecholamines on parameters of myocardial contractility (PEPc, PEP/LVET) were presumably offset by the increased afterload. We conclude that the acute hemodynamic changes of smoking in healthy subjects depend upon the amount of nicotine absorbed.", 
    "47": "We investigated the responsiveness of isolated diabetic and normal rabbit aortic strips to norepinephrine. Alloxan, 160 mg/kg, was administered intravenously 1 mo before experiments were performed. Helically cut thoracic aortic strips from diabetic and control animals were suspended side by side in the same muscle bath. The maximum contractile response to norepinephrine of diabetic strips was 68 +/- 5% of control in eight pairs of animals (P less than 0.001). This differential response was not changed by propranolol or cocaine, indicating that it is not explained by either enhanced beta receptor activity or more avid uptake of norepinephrine by nerve endings. Tyramine responses displayed the same differential, suggesting that endogenous release of norepinephrine also results in a lower response of diabetic aortic strips. Maximum responses to KCl were also markedly depressed in strips from nine diabetic rabbits (P less than 0.005). This indicates that the diabetes-induced changes occur at a stage in contraction beyond alpha-receptor activation."
