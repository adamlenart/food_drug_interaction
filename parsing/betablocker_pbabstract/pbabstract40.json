    "1": "Rat atrial myocyte whole-cell currents were recorded at 36\u00b0C. Noradrenaline potently inhibited IKss (IC50 = 0.90 nM, 42.1 \u00b1 4.3% at 1 \u00b5M, n = 7) and potentiated the L-type Ca(2+) current (ICaL, EC50 = 136 nM, 205 \u00b1 40% at 1 \u00b5M, n = 6). Noradrenaline-sensitive IKss was weakly voltage-dependent, time-independent, and potentiated by the arachidonic acid analogue, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (EYTA; 10 \u00b5M), or by osmotically induced membrane stretch. Noise analysis revealed a unitary conductance of 8.4 \u00b1 0.42 pS (n = 8). The biophysical/pharmacological properties of IKss indicate a TREK-like K(+) channel. The effect of noradrenaline on IKss was abolished by combined \u03b21-/\u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonism (1 \u00b5M propranolol or 10 \u00b5M \u03b21-selective atenolol and 100 nM \u03b22-selective ICI-118,551 in combination), but not by \u03b21- or \u03b22-antagonist alone. The action of noradrenaline could be mimicked by \u03b22-agonists (zinterol and fenoterol) in the presence of \u03b21-antagonist. The action of noradrenaline on IKss, but not on ICaL, was abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment. The action of noradrenaline on ICaL was mediated by \u03b21-adrenoceptors via a PTX-insensitive pathway. Noradrenaline prolonged APD30 by 52 \u00b1 19% (n = 5; P < 0.05), and this effect was abolished by combined \u03b21-/\u03b22-antagonism, but not by atenolol alone.",

In this study, the fate of a mixture of pharmaceuticals and several of their transformation products present in the primary effluent of a local WWTP was assessed in sequencing batch reactors operated under different redox conditions: fully aerobic, anoxic/aerobic, and microaerobic (DO concentration \u22480.3mg/L). Among the pharmaceuticals that were tracked during this study (atenolol, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, and phenytoin), overall loss varied between them and between redox environments. Losses of atenolol and trimethoprim were highest in the aerobic reactor; sulfamethoxazole loss was highest in the microaerobic reactors; and phenytoin was recalcitrant in all reactors. Transformation products of sulfamethoxazole and desvenlafaxine resulted in the reformation of their parent compounds during treatment. The results suggest that transformation products must be accounted for when assessing removal efficiencies and that redox environment influences the degree of pharmaceutical loss.",

In USA and Europe hospital mortality of children with heart failure is about 7% of children, nearly twice as high as in adults. In this review a group of authors report about their experience with beta-blockers in childhood heart failure. Most of them start to treat children with severe heart failure at a time - 20 years ago - when beta blockers seem to be contraindicated in this situation. The physicians and their patients and/or parents all are aware of the risk of this decision. However, unproven medical therapies for heart failure are the most important therapeutical dilemma in pediatric cardiology. The authors carefully observed a highly selected group of patients with the highest risk to die and had the patience to wait for the longtime follow up. Today - based upon this experience -we know that beta blockers are safe and may save the lives of many children with heart disease all over the world. Together with young colleagues who enthusiastically support this idea the authors now intend to break down the \"wall of ignorance\" for this promising therapy in pediatric cardiology.",

Heart failure has a high impact on prognosis, growth and neurodevelopment. Prior to surgery or after palliative procedures children need a medical heart failure therapy. The traditional therapy with digoxin, diuretics and ACE-inhibitors is not supported by prospective randomized trials. Propranolol had a significant beneficial effect on the clinical heart failure score, neurohormonal activation, heart rate variability and cardiac remodeling in the prospective randomized trial CHF-Pro-Infant. Beta-blocker dosages depend on heart rate with a target between 100 and 110 bpm in infants and an average dose of 2mg/kg/day after a titration period of 2 to 3 weeks. Within the last 18 years after the first case the author treated only infants with severe heart failure and highly elevated Pro-BNP-levels (8879 pg/ml on average).

After dissemination of mechanical ventilation, heart failure is the main cause of death in DMD. Regular assessment of cardiopulmonary function, early introduction of cardioprotective therapy and intensive respiratory care are the key issues in medical managements of DMD. In DMD, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) are used as the first line drugs. Beta-blockers (BB) are usually added to ACEI/ARB, when they cannot achieve sufficient effects. Although high dose of BB might be required for functional improvements, even a low dose BB can reduce cardiac events. Recent meta-analyses reported heart rate reduction is more important than BB dose for reducing mortality. Thus heart rate monitoring is essential for titration of BB. Tachycardia under optimal respiratory care can also be an indicator of BB. Although the introduction of BB is relatively safe under gradual dose-escalation from a low dose, hospitalization during uptitration should be considered in advanced cases.",

This on the other hand encounter physician and patients various problems due to late complications after the heart surgery like congestive heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden death. One of the challenging area is the medical management of heart failure in these patients with complex anatomy and hemodynamics. The lack of evidence of the effectiveness of the anti congestive medications in this population in from of large randomized controlled trials, makes it difficult to establish universally accepted therapy guidelines. In this article we will review the evidence of the beta-blockers in heart failure in patients with congenital heart disease. Also we will discuss the mechanisms of heart failure in this patient&#039;s cohort and will review the literature with respect to the use of neurohormonal antagonists in congenital heart disease. There is an urgent need to initiate well-designed clinical trials to prove if the positive results of neurohormonal blockade in acquired heart failure in adults can be translated in patients with congenital heart disease.", 
    "38": "Congestive cardiac failure accounts for 36% of childhood deaths in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in infants with heart failure symptoms before two years of age, the mortality is extremely high unless treatment with beta-receptor antagonists is instituted. The mechanism of heart failure is not systolic dysfunction, but rather extreme diastolic dysfunction leading to high filling pressures. Risk factors for development of heart failure are a generalized pattern of hypertrophy with a left ventricular posterior wall-to- cavity ratio >0.30, the presence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at rest, and the co-existence of syndromes in the Noonan/Leopard/Costello spectrum. The 5-year survival of high-risk patients is improved from 54% to 93% by high-dose beta-blocker therapy (>4.5 mg/kg/day propranolol). The mechanism of the beneficial effect of beta-blockers is to improve diastolic function by lengthening of diastole, reducing outflow-obstruction, and inducing a beneficial remodelling resulting in a larger left ventricular cavity, and improved stroke volume. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with increased activity of cardiac sympathetic nerves, and infants in heart failure with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy show signs of extreme sympathetic over-activity, and require exceptionally high doses of beta-blockers to achieve effective beta-blockade as judged by 24 h Holter recordings, often 8-24 mg/kg/day of propranolol or equivalent.", 
    "39": "Beta-blocker therapy is without doubt the treatment of choice for patients with heart failure caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but the dose needs to carefully titrated on an individual basis for maximum benefit, and the dose required is surprisingly large in infants with heart failure due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",

The pathogenesis underlying IRI is complex, involving a series of signaling mediators and mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIG) on the changes of oxidant stress and apoptosis induced by IRI in human hepatic L02 cells. L02 cells with IRI were treated with or without MgIG and mitoKATP (Mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-dependent potassium) channel modulators. Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured. Effects of MgIG on the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase 3, PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase), Akt, and ERK in L02 cells with IRI were examined. Our results showed that MgIG treatment significantly reduced the population of apoptotic cells and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in hepatic L02 cells with IRI. MgIG also counteract ischemia reperfusion induced oxidative challenge as it effectively reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activities of SOD and GSH-Px. L02 cells treated with MgIG showed increased expression of p-Akt and p-ERK, indicating that the protective effect of MgIG might be associated with the activation of Akt and ERK pathways. Moreover, the addition of Diazoxide (DE), a mitoKATP channel opener, enhanced the cytoprotective activity of MgIG, while the mitoKATP blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) reduced the cytoprotective activity of MgIG.", 
    "46": "In preclinical studies, endothelin receptor A (ETA) antagonists (ETAi) attenuated the progression of heart failure (HF). However, clinical HF trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of ETAi. These conflicting data may be explained by the possibility that established HF drugs such as adrenergic receptor blockers interfered with the mechanism of ETAi action in clinical trials. Here we report that mice lacking ETA only in sympathetic neurons (SN-KO) showed less adverse structural remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in response to pathological pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). In contrast, mice lacking ETA only in cardiomyocytes (CM-KO) were not protected. TAC led to a disturbed sympathetic nerve function as measured by cardiac norepinephrine (NE) tissue levels and [(124)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine-PET, which was prevented in SN-KO. In a rat model of HF, ETAi improved cardiac and sympathetic nerve function. In cocultures of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and sympathetic neurons (SNs), endothelin-1 (ET1) led to a massive NE release and exaggerated CM hypertrophy compared with CM monocultures. ETA-deficient CMs gained a hypertrophic response through wild-type SNs, but ETA-deficient SNs failed to mediate exaggerated CM hypertrophy. Furthermore, ET1 mediated its effects indirectly via NE in CM-SN cocultures through adrenergic receptors and histone deacetylases, resulting in activation of the prohypertrophic transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2. In conclusion, sympathetic ETA amplifies ET1 effects on CMs through adrenergic signaling pathways. Thus, antiadrenergic therapies may blunt potentially beneficial effects of ETAi. Taken together, this may indicate that patients with \u03b2 blocker intolerance or disturbed sympathetic nerve function could be evaluated for a potential benefit from ETAi.", 
    "47": "Currently, propranolol is the preferred treatment for problematic proliferating infantile haemangiomas (IHs). The rapid action of propranolol has been shown to be especially dramatic in IHs involving dyspnoea, haemodynamic compromise, palpebral occlusion or ulceration. Another remarkable aspect of propranolol treatment revealed that the growth of the IHs was not only stabilized, but also that the improvement continued until complete involution was achieved, leading to a considerable shortening of the natural course of IH. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of propranolol have not been fully elucidated. Recent studies have offered evidence of a variety of mechanisms. These include the promotion of pericyte-mediated vasoconstriction, the inhibition of vasculogenesis and catecholamine-induced angiogenesis, the disruption of haemodynamic force-induced cell survival, and the inactivation of the renin-angiotensin system. This review summarizes these mechanisms and the new concepts that are emerging in this area of research. Moreover, several molecular mechanisms by which propranolol may modify neovascularization in IH have also been proposed. The antihaemangioma effect of propranolol may not be attributable to a single mechanism, but rather to a combination of events that have not yet been elucidated or understood. Further studies are needed to evaluate and verify these mechanisms to gain a greater understanding of the effects of the intake of propranolol on haemangioma involution.",

Natural sediments (combined sewer overflow and stream sediments) were extracted by ultrasonic-assisted extraction followed by solid-phase extraction. Analyses were performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) using atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation in positive mode (APCI+) with a total analysis time of 4.5 min.

    "103": "Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a genetic, X-linked, rare but often fatal, pediatric skeletal- and cardiomyopathy occurring due to mutations in the tafazzin gene (TAZ). TAZ encodes a transacylase involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, also called tafazzin, which is responsible for remodeling the inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid, cardiolipin (CL). Tafazzin mutations lead to compositional alterations in CL molecular species, causing extensive mitochondrial aberrations and ultrastructural muscle damage. There are no specific treatments or cure for BTHS. Current therapy is largely palliative and aimed at treatment of organ-specific complications during disease progression. Polypharmacy frequently occurs during treatment and may lead to severe adverse events. Adverse reactions may originate from exogenous factors such as the inadvertent co-administration of contraindicated drugs. Theoretically, endogenous factors such as polymorphic variations in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes may also precipitate fatal toxicity. Investigation of the consequences of pharmacogenomic variations on BTHS therapy is lacking. To our knowledge, this review presents the first examination of the possible sources of pharmacogenomic variations that may affect BTHS therapy. We also explore BTHSspecific patents for possible treatment options. The patents discussed suggest innovative strategies for treatment, including feeding linoleic acid to patients to overcome compositional CL deficiency; or the use of 2S,4R ketoconazole formulations to augment CL levels; or the delivery of mitochondrial stabilizing cargo. Future research directions are also discussed.",

Both antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy should be adopted for patients with arteriovenous embolism. Balancing the risk of ischemia and hemorrhage is especially challenging in these patients in order to achieve an optimal clinical benefit. We report on a 55-year-old female with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), subsequently diagnosed as having acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and a cerebral infarction. Examinations had been carried out, excluding potential arteriovenous shunts, cancer, antiphospholipid syndrome and other common hypercoagulable states. A combination of an anticoagulant drug (rivaroxaban, an Xa inhibitor) and an antiplatelet agent (clopidogrel, an ADP receptor inhibitor) was prescribed with a \u03b2-blocker and atorvastatin. The embolus was gradually shrunk during the next 10 months, and then it turned back into expanding. During the 16 months' follow-up, an aneurysm of left ventricular apex was found through an echocardiogram and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was administered. We conclude that combined anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy significantly relieved the symptoms and improved the prognosis in patients suffering from arteriovenous embolism without any major clinical bleeding events.",

Both patients had prolonged sinus tachycardia averaging >110 beats per minute and developed depressed left ventricular function, which recovered when treated with \u03b2 blockers. Sinus tachycardia is often considered a physiological response to stress, and the purpose of this manuscript is to describe the cardiac injury apparently related to a prolonged stress response.

Most of these studies did not define the \u03b2-blocker used, making it difficult to understand the source of discrepancies between results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of non-cardioselective and cardioselective \u03b2-blockers on melanoma progression at the cellular, molecular, and tumor levels. Here we show that the non-cardioselective \u03b2-blocker propranolol hydrochloride (propranolol) inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in primary cell cultures derived from a primary and a metastasis of human melanoma and in melanoma cell lines. In contrast, the cardioselective \u03b2-blocker metoprolol tartrate hardly affects melanoma cell survival or proliferation. We further highlight that a daily treatment with propranolol slows down tumor development in immunodeficient mice transplanted with human melanoma cells. RNA microarrays, quantitative PCR, and histochemistry analyses showed that propranolol regulates the expression of different genes involved in tumor angiogenesis, cell death, or proliferation. Thus, our results suggest that non-cardioselective \u03b2-blockers affect melanoma progression, and bring first clues about the pathways involved in this antitumor effect.",

Causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in patients with liver cirrhosis can be grouped into two categories: the first includes lesions that arise by virtue of portal hypertension, namely gastroesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy; and the second includes lesions seen in the general population (peptic ulcer, erosive gastritis, reflux esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, tumors, etc.). Emergency upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the standard procedure recommended for both diagnosis and treatment of UGIB. The endoscopic treatment of choice for esophageal variceal bleeding is band ligation of varices. Bleeding from gastric varices is treated by injection with cyanoacrylate. Treatment with vasoactive drugs as well as antibiotic treatment is started before or at the same time as endoscopy. Bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy is less frequent, usually chronic and treatment options include \u03b2-blocker therapy, injection therapy and interventional radiology.

Activation mapping of the LV epicardium with a 21 \u00d7 24 electrode plaque was performed in 12 open-chest pigs. Pigs were given either verapamil (0.136 mg/kg) or sotalol (1.5 mg/kg) and verapamil. Reentry patterns were quantified for SDVF, and, for LDVF, activation patterns were compared with our previously reported control LDVF data. Verapamil significantly increased conduction velocity around the reentrant core by 10% and reduced the reentrant cycle length by 15%, with a net reduction in reentry incidence of 70%. Sotolol had an opposite effect of decreasing the conduction velocity around the core by 6% but increasing the reentrant cycle length by 13%, with a net reduction of reentry incidence of 50%. After 200 s of VF, verapamil significantly slowed wavefront conduction velocity and activation rate compared with control data. Verapamil decreased the incidence of reentry in SDVF by accelerating conduction velocity to increase the likelihood of conduction block, possibly through increased sympathetic tone. The drug slowed activation rate and conduction velocity after 200 s of VF, suggesting that L-type Ca(++) channels remain active and may be important in the maintenance of LDVF. Sotalol in addition to verapamil caused no additional antiarrhythmic effect.",

    "167": "Currently, nonselective \u03b2-blockers (NSBBs) are commonly used for the prevention of variceal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. The beneficial effects of NSBBs are primarily attributed to the reduction in cardiac output by blockade of \u03b21 receptors and vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation by the blockade of \u03b22 receptors. The prognostic value of occlusive portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhotic patients has been increasingly recognized. The most important risk factor for the development of PVT in liver cirrhosis is the decreased portal vein inflow velocity. Collectively, we propose that the use of NSBBs potentially increases the development of portal vein thrombosis by reducing portal vein inflow velocity. The hypothesis should be confirmed by prospective cohort studies, in which cirrhotic patients without prior PVT treated with and without NSBBs are enrolled, and the development of PVT during follow-up is compared between the two groups. Additionally, subgroup analyses should be performed according to the dosage of NSBBs and the reduction of portal inflow velocity after use of NSBBs.",

When K2P 2.1 isoforms generated by ATI were studied separately in oocytes, the IC50 value for carvedilol inhibition of full-length channels (16.5\u2009\u03bcM) was almost 5-fold less than that for the truncated channel variant (IC50 = 79.0\u2009\u03bcM).

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic potency of circulating ACE2 activity in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Blood samples were withdrawn from patients with idiopathic DCM and healthy control subjects. The DCM patients were subdivided into 2 groups according to their New York Heart Association classification. The plasma ACE2 activity was measured by a fluorescence method. Plasma ACE2 activity was significantly increased in DCM patients, correlating with clinical severity. It was correlating with echocardiographic parameters in patients with DCM. Furthermore, plasma ACE2 activity had the potency to predict cardiac death and heart transplantation. However, compared with patients with Chagas' disease, the correlation and predictive value of ACE2 activity in patients with DCM was much less pronounced. Beta blocker treatment in patients with DCM was identified to prevent the association between circulating ACE2 activity and echocardiographic parameters. Although ACE2 activity in blood samples of patients with DCM without beta blockers is potent in correlating with the severity of disease and in predicting death and heart transplantation, its correlation and prediction potency are significantly diminished by beta blocker treatment.",

MS-layered cores with high drug-layering efficiency (97% w/w) were first prepared by spraying a highly concentrated drug aqueous solution (60% w/w, 70\u00b0C) on non-pareils without using other binders. The presence of MS in ethylcellulose (EC) coating solution significantly improved the coating process by reducing pellets sticking, which often occurs during organic coating. There may be a maximum physical compatibility of MS with EC, and the physical state of the drug in the functional coating layer of EC/MS (80:20) was simultaneously crystalline and non-crystalline (amorphous or solid molecule solution). The lag phase associated with hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) as a pore former was not observed when MS was used as a pore former. The drug release from EC/MS-coated pellets was pH independent, inversely proportional to the coating levels, and directly related to the pore former levels. The functional coating layer with MS as a pore former was not completely stabilized without curing. Curing at 60\u00b0C for 1 day could substantially improve the stability of EC/MS-coated pellets. The physical state of the drug in the free film of EC/MS (85:15) changed partially from amorphous to crystal when cured at 60\u00b0C for 1 day, which should be attributed to the incompatibility of the drug with EC.",

Also, the effects of p-NP in combination with actinomycin D (10(-5) M) (gene transcription inhibitor), cycloheximide (10(-4) M) (protein synthesis inhibitor), fulvestrant (10(-6) M) (pure estrogen receptor antagonist), 2-hydroxy-5-nonanoylbenzamide (10(-3) M) (compound 1b, anti-uterotrophic compound) on spontaneous uterine contractions, and with propranolol (20\u2009\u00b5M) (\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist) and noradrenaline (5\u2009\u00b5M) on KCl (40\u2009mM) induced contractions were investigated. p-NP exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition on spontaneous uterine contractions. There was no significant difference between the highest p-NP concentration (10(-6) M) and the positive control 17-\u03b2-E2 in terms of % inhibition (p>0.05). The inhibitory effect of p-NP (10(-6) M) on spontaneous contractions was blocked by actinomycin D (p<0.001), cycloheximide (p<0.001), fulvestrant (p<0.001) and compound 1b (p<0.001). 17-\u03b2-E2 (10(-5) M) exerted a higher inhibition % on KCl induced contractions than p-NP (10(-6) M). The relaxant effect of p-NP on KCl-induced uterine contractions was inhibited by noradrenaline (p<0.05) but not by propranolol (p>0.05). We suggest that p-NP inhibited uterine contractions similar as 17-\u03b2-E2 and genomic pathways are involved and \u03b2-adrenoceptors might modulate the activity of p-NP.

The aim of this study was to characterize \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation and facilitation of norepinephrine release in the aorta of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase-knockout (Pnmt-KO) mice. Catecholamines were quantified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection. Aortic rings were mounted in a myograph to determine concentration-response curves to selective \u03b21- or \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists in the absence or presence of selective \u03b21- or \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonists. Aortic rings were also preincubated with [(3)H]norepinephrine to measure tritium overflow elicited by electrical stimulation in the presence of increasing concentrations of nonselective \u03b2- or selective \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists. \u03b22-Adrenoceptor protein density was evaluated by Western blotting and \u03b22-adrenoceptor localization by immunohistochemistry. Epinephrine is absent in Pnmt-KO mice. The potency and the maximal effect of the \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonist terbutaline were lower in Pnmt-KO than in wild-type (WT) mice. The selective \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 [(\u00b1)-erythro-(S*,S*)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxy]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol hydrochloride] antagonized the relaxation caused by terbutaline in WT but not in Pnmt-KO mice. Isoproterenol and terbutaline induced concentration-dependent increases in tritium overflow in WT mice only. \u03b22-Adrenoceptor protein density was decreased in membrane aorta homogenates of Pnmt-KO mice, and this finding was supported by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. In conclusion, epinephrine is crucial for \u03b22-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation and facilitation of norepinephrine release. In the absence of epinephrine, \u03b22-adrenoceptor protein density was decreased in aorta cell membranes, thus potentially hindering its functional activity.",

Box-Behnken experimental design and response surface methodology were employed to assist the optimization of SALLME conditions, including salt concentration, the pH of sample solution and vortex time as variable factors. The optimal extraction conditions were as follows: to 50 \u00b5L of AH sample, 100 \u00b5L of phosphate buffer (100 mmol L(-1), pH 11.9), 90 \u00b5L of acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.11 g of (NH4)2SO4 salt were added into an Eppendorf vial (1 mL) then vortexed for 1.1 min. As an effort to miniaturize SALLE system, a 1 mL syringe adapted with a capillary tube was employed as the phase separation device. Once the phase separation occurred, the upper layer could be narrowed into the capillary tube by pushing the plunger; thus, the collection of the upper layer solvent was simple and convenient. By miniaturization, the consumption of the organic solvent was decreased as low as possible. The chromatographic separation was achieved on Gemini C18 column using a mobile phase of ACN: 30 mmol L(-1) potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer containing 0.1% triethylamine, pH 3.5 (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL min(-1) and UV detection at 254 and 295 nm for DOR and TIM, respectively.

This study investigated the molecular consequences of propranolol treatment for IH in vivo.Immunohistochemical and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining was performed on five age matched patients with proliferative IH. Two patients (A and B) were undergoing propranolol treatment at the time of surgical resection.Propranolol treatment increased apoptosis, and induced mast cells to degranulate and secrete tryptase into the interstitium. The microvessels of patient A were immature [weak von Willibrand Factor (vWF), and strong osteoprotegerin (OPG) staining], comparable to untreated proliferative IH, while those of patient B were mature (strong vWF staining, and no OPG staining). The perivascular CD90 mesenchymal stem cell population was preserved in both propranolol treated patients.Using rarely obtained biopsies from IH patients treated with propranolol, we show increased apoptosis by propranolol for the first time in vivo. We also suggest that mast cells, through secreted proteases, may contribute to the decreased fibrofatty residuum seen with propranolol treatment.",

    "199": "Outpatients managed by GPs were older (69\u00b110 vs 66\u00b112 years), and the prevalence of men was less marked (58% vs 67%). They also had higher left ventricular ejection fraction (38\u00b16% vs 35\u00b18%) and had more pulmonary congestion (63% vs 49%) and peripheral oedema (66% vs 51%), compared with those treated by cardiologists (all p<0.001). Hypertension (74% vs 66%), previous stroke and/or transient ischaemic attack (21% vs 16%), diabetes (40% vs 30%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14% vs 11%) were more common in outpatients of GPs (all p<0.001). GPs were less likely to prescribe \u03b2-blocker (95% vs 97%, p<0.01), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) (56% vs 64%, p<0.001), and loop diuretic (61% vs 64%, p<0.05) or use PCI (33% vs 44%, p<0.001), CABG (11% vs 16%, p<0.001), ICD (4% vs 10%, p<0.001), or CRT (1% vs 5%, p<0.001).

Outpatients treated by GPs are older and have more co-morbidities. Outpatients treated by cardiologists more commonly receive \u03b2-blocker, MRA, ICD, and CRT, and undergo coronary revascularisations.", 
    "201": "Despite the fact that recent evidence from meta-analysis of randomized trials indicates an increase in mortality, perioperative treatment with \u03b2-blockers is still widely advocated. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of cohort studies to evaluate the effects of perioperative \u03b2-blockers on mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery in the real world scenarios.", 
    "202": "We searched PubMed and Embase from the inception to April 2014 for cohort studies, assessing the effect of perioperative \u03b2-blockers on mortality in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Adjusted relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was pooled using random effect models.",

Perioperative \u03b2-blockers were not associated with a reduced risk of mortality (RR=0.88, 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.04), postoperation myocardial infarction (RR=1.30, 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.23), and postoperation stroke (RR=1.17, 95% CI, 0.53 to 2.57). However, in subgroup analysis of mortality, taking \u03b2-blockers on the day of surgery caused statistically significant increase in mortality of 91% (RR=1.91, 95% CI, 1.01 to 3.62).", 
    "204": "In the real world scenarios, for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, the routine use of \u03b2-blockers does not seem to reduce the risk of death. Moreover, those who are taking \u03b2-blockers on the day of surgery may have an increased risk of postoperative mortality. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of the significant heterogeneity across the studies.", 
    "205": "Infantile haemangioma (IH) is the most frequent childhood tumour. Although it is benign and self-limiting, severe complications can arise due to localisation and fast tumour growth. Management and therapy of IH has changed greatly after 2008 with propranolol. However, the pathogenesis remains elusive. This update provides an overview of all possible mechanisms currently considered. We discuss the possibility that several mechanisms act together, although local hypoxia seems to be important. Clinically, in about half of the cases, an IH is preceded by an anaemic macula (local ischaemia) or a so-called precursor lesion. Laboratory findings indicate stabilisation and an increased transcription activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1\u03b1), leading to up-regulation of its downstream target genes (such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), which normally occurs in cases of hypoxia.", 
    "206": "Three main hypotheses have been proposed, namely (1) the theory of tissue hypoxia, (2) the theory of embolization of placental endothelial cells and (3) the theory of increased angiogenic and vasculogenic activity.", 
    "207": "Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 signaling plays critical roles during skeletal development and its excessive signaling causes genetic diseases of connective tissues including Marfan syndrome and acromelic dysplasia. However, the mechanisms underlying prevention of excessive TGF-\u03b2 signaling in skeletogenesis remain unclear. We previously reported that Dullard/Ctdnep1 encoding a small phosphatase is required for nephron maintenance after birth through suppression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Unexpectedly, we found that Dullard is involved in suppression of TGF-\u03b2 signaling during endochondral ossification. Conditional Dullard-deficient mice in the limb and sternum mesenchyme by Prx1-Cre displayed the impaired growth and ossification of skeletal elements leading to postnatal lethality. Dullard was expressed in early cartilage condensations and later in growth plate chondrocytes. The tibia growth plate of newborn Dullard mutant mice showed reduction of the proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocyte layers. The sternum showed deformity of cartilage primordia and delayed hypertrophy. Micromass culture experiments revealed that Dullard deficiency enhanced early cartilage condensation and differentiation, but suppressed mineralized hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, which was reversed by treatment with TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor kinase blocker LY-364947. Dullard deficiency induced upregulation of protein levels of both phospho-Smad2/3 and total Smad2/3 in micromass cultures without increase of Smad2/3 mRNA levels, suggesting that Dullard may affect Smad2/3 protein stability. The phospho-Smad2/3 level was also upregulated in perichondrium and hypertrophic chondrocytes in Dullard-deficient embryos. Response to TGF-\u03b2 signaling was enhanced in Dullard-deficient primary chondrocyte cultures at late, but not early, time point. Moreover, perinatal administration of LY-364947 ameliorated the sternum deformity in vivo. Thus, we identified Dullard as a new negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in endochondral ossification.",

Propranolol was orally administered at a dose of 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg daily (1.0 mg/kg for infants aged 2.5 months or under; 1.5 mg/kg for those aged 2.5 months or above). Dynamic observations of hemangioma size, texture or color change and adverse events during treatment were performed. Drug withdrawal was usually made after dosing for 1 year or under when there was a total regression of hemandiomas. The efficacy was evaluated on a 4-level scale.",

Recent international guidelines for hypertension have emphasised the usefulness of ambulatory BP for diagnosis and management of hypertension. We used ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to monitor the effect of the pharmacological treatment in patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension. This was a multicentric randomised controlled trial having 360 subjects with 180 in each treatment arm. The duration of study was 6 months. The patients were randomly selected to receive atenolol or losartan as initial therapy. The dose of atenolol or losartan was 50 mg once daily at 8 am in the morning. Ambulatory BP assessment was done in a subgroup of subjects using Schiller BR-102 plus machine. One hundred and thirty patients were recruited for the study using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. There were 66 patients in atenolol arm and 64 patients in the losartan arm. A significant white coat hypertension was noticed in both the arms. Out of 130 subjects in the ambulatory group, 41.53% had a white coat hypertension. Statistically significant reduction of office BP was observed with both atenolol and losartan; however, no significant difference in efficacy of the two drugs was found in reducing office BP. However, when using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the reduction with either drug was not significant. The dipper status was better in the atenolol group than the losartan group. Neither of the drugs prevent morning surge of BP when administered once daily in the morning. There was high prevalence of white coat hypertension in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension. There was similar reduction of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure by the 2 study drugs. Atenolol scores over losartan in converting non-dipper to dipper but its' impact on clinical outcome is not known. Morning surge of BP was unaffected by either of the study drugs.",

We report a case of acquired hypothyroidism associated with a parotid hemangioma in a male child, who was initially evaluated at 48 days of age due to persistent jaundice. Replacement hormonal therapy was promptly started, but resolution of the clinical and laboratory findings of hypothyroidism was only achieved at 3 months of age, when propranolol treatment was added to the therapeutic regimen. Our review of the literature retrieved only one case of proven consumptive hypothyroidism associated with a parotid infantile hemangioma, making a real incidence an underestimate: we believe one should consider this association a real possibility."
