    "1": "Of 146 AMI cases admitted, 72 fit with criteria and underwent 16-slice MDCT (4 +/- 2 days after AMI) with beta-blockers. There were no complications except 1 patient who had from complete atrioventricular block. Results were compared with conventional coronary angiography (CCA) within 3 days. In 55 (73.3%) of 72 patients, all arteries were assessable. In total, the number of assessable arteries was 253 (87.8%), and 35 (12.2%) vessels were nonassessable, mostly because of motion artifacts and extensive calcification. Overall, 84 of the 115 lesions (> or = 50% lumen reduction) were correctly detected by MDCT (sensitivity 73.0%). The accuracy in classifying patients with nonsignificant, single-, or multiple-vessel diseases was 79.1%. The accuracy for residual lesions with >50% stenosis of IRA was 87.5%. There was a good correlation regarding the severity of residual stenosis of the IRA (0%, 1%-49%, 50%-89%, 90%-99%, or occlusion) between MDCT and CCA (Spearman correlation 0.94, P < .001). Lesions with 90% to 99% or occlusion of the IRA were accurately detected or ruled out in 31 of 36 cases (86.1%).",

So does the arrhythmogenic effect of serotonin result from the mechanism of action of the receptor or the context of its action upon cardiac myocytes? The capacity of agonists to produce cAMP followed the sequence 5-HT < Iso < Forskolin to increase ICaL with 5-HT = Iso = Forskolin. The simultaneous application of threshold concentrations of 5-HT and Iso maximally increased ICaL.

    "19": "Thyrotoxicosis is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, primarily due to heart failure and thromboembolism. Palpitations, caused by sinus tachycardia and occasionally by atrial fibrillation, are the most frequent cardiovascular symptom. As atrial fibrillation may be the only manifestation of thyrotoxicosis, thyroid hormone excess should routinely be excluded in patients with this rhythm disturbance. Heart failure occurs mostly in the presence of underlying heart disease or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in patients with long-standing atrial fibrillation. On occasion, long-standing hyperthyroidism may lead to heart failure even in the absence of concomitant cardiac conditions. Beta-blockers offer symptomatic relief and at the same time slow the ventricular response in patients with atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone, and occasionally iodinated contrast agents, may cause iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis. Clinical suspicion is essential in the diagnosis of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), because the antiadrenergic effect of the drug may conceal symptoms. AIT should be considered in any patient on amiodarone in the presence of new-onset or recurrent atrial arrhythmias or unexplained weight loss. Beyond discontinuation of amiodarone, treatment options include propylthiouracil or methimazole, potassium perchlorate, steroids, lithium and, if pharmacological treatment fails, surgery. Amiodarone may potentially be used less frequently in the future since recent studies have shown that this drug is inferior to implantable cardioverter defibrillators in prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with severe heart failure. In addition, non-iodinated amiodarone analogues are currently in advanced phase of clinical testing.", 
    "20": "Ca2+ and cAMP are important second messengers that regulate multiple cellular processes. Although previous studies have suggested direct interactions between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways, the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In particular, direct evidence for Ca2+-regulated cAMP production in living cells is incomplete. Genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors have made possible real-time imaging of spatial and temporal gradients of intracellular cAMP concentration in single living cells. Here, we used confocal microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and insulin-secreting MIN6 cells expressing Epac1-camps, a biosynthetic unimolecular cAMP indicator, to better understand the role of intracellular Ca2+ in cAMP production. We report that depolarization with high external K+, tolbutamide, or glucose caused a rapid increase in cAMP that was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by nitrendipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, or 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine, a P-site antagonist of transmembrane adenylate cyclases. Stimulation of MIN6 cells with glucose in the presence of tetraethylammonium chloride generated concomitant Ca2+ and cAMP oscillations that were abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and blocked by 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ and cAMP concentrations with Fura-2 and Epac1-camps, respectively, revealed a close temporal and causal interrelationship between the increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cAMP levels following membrane depolarization. These findings indicate highly coordinated interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in electrically excitable endocrine cells and suggest that Ca2+-dependent cAMP oscillations are derived from an increase in adenylate cyclase activity and periodic activation and inactivation of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase.",

    "22": "Nuclear quadrupole resonance is a radio frequency (rf) spectroscopic technique, closely related to NMR, which can be used to detect signals from solids containing nuclei with spin quantum number >1/2. It is nondestructive, highly specific and noninvasive, requires no static magnetic field, and as such is currently used in the detection of explosives and narcotics. Recent technological advances in pulsed NQR methods have shortened detection times, eliminated spurious signals, and enhanced the sensitivity of detection of 14N frequencies, which lie in the low rf range of 0.4-6 MHz, encouraging a wider range of \"real world\" applications. This Perspective highlights some of the advantages of NQR, the applications in which it could be used, such as the quantification of pharmaceuticals and the identification of polymorphs. Other roles could include detection, analysis, and quality control of pharmaceuticals at all stages of manufacture. Finally, recent advances which enhance even further the sensitivity of detection will be discussed.", 
    "23": "Not uncommonly the effective treatment of hypertension requires multi-drug therapy. Multi-drug combinations that dominate clinical practice typically include a thiazide-type diuretic together with either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or an angiotensin-receptor blocker, or a beta-blocker. On the other hand, there are several medication choices that provide incremental blood pressure reduction but all too often go under-appreciated as to their effectiveness. Such drug combinations include within class switching of diuretics, combining a thiazide-type diuretic with a calcium-channel blocker, utilizing 2 calcium-channel blockers from different classes, giving an ACE inhibitor together with an angiotensin-receptor blocker, adding an aldosterone receptor antagonist to any of several other drug classes, as well as adding nitrate therapy to any of several other drug classes.

    "29": "The mammalian heart expresses all three isoforms of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) in diverse cell types of the myocardium. Despite their apparent promiscuity, the NOS isoforms support specific signaling because of their subcellular compartmentation with colocalized effectors and limited diffusibility of NO in muscle cells. eNOS and nNOS sustain normal EC coupling and contribute to the early and late phases of the Frank-Starling mechanism of the heart. They also attenuate the beta1-/beta2-adrenergic increase in inotropy and chronotropy, and reinforce the pre- and post-synaptic vagal control of cardiac contraction. By doing so, the NOS protect the heart against excessive stimulation by catecholamines, just as an \"endogenous beta-blocker\". In the ischemic and failing myocardium, induced iNOS further reinforces this effect, as does eNOS coupled to overexpressed beta3-adrenoceptors. nNOS expression also increases in the aging and infarcted heart, but its role (compensatory or deleterious) is less clear. In addition to their direct regulation of contractility, the NOS modulate oxygen consumption, substrate utilization, sensitivity to apoptosis, hypertrophy and regenerative potential, all of which illustrate the pleiotropic effects of this radical on the cardiac cell biology.",

OPC-14523 (1 microM) increased guanosine-5'-O-(3-[35S]thio)-triphosphate ([35S]GTPgammaS) binding to 5-HT1A receptor-containing regions of rat brain tissue sections (approximately 53% of the effect of 1 microM (+)8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ((+)8-OH-DPAT) that were blocked by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635). OPC-14523 also behaved as a partial agonist in its stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding to membranes from rat hippocampus (pEC50=7.60+/-0.23, Emax=41.1% of the effect of 10 microM (+)8-OH-DPAT), human frontal cortex (pEC50=7.89+/-0.08; Emax=64% of the effect of 10 microM (+)8-OH-DPAT), and Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing cloned human 5-HT1A receptors (pEC50=8.0+/-0.11; Emax=85.5% of the effect of 10 microM 5-HT), and all of these effects of OPC-14523 were blocked by WAY-100635.

    "32": "The present study aimed to determine the anatomic distribution and developmental profile of alpha(2) and beta adrenoceptors (AR) in marine teleost brain. Alpha 2 and beta adrenoceptors were studied at different developmental stages by using [(3)H]clonidine and [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol, respectively, by means of in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Furthermore, immunohistochemical localization of the receptor subtypes was performed to determine their cellular distribution. Saturation studies determined a high-affinity component of [(3)H]clonidine and [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites. High levels of both receptors were found in preglomerular complex, ventral hypothalamus, and lateral torus. Dorsal hypothalamus and isthmus included high levels of alpha(2) AR, whereas pretectum and molecular and proliferative zone of cerebellum were specifically characterized by high densities of beta AR. From the first year of life, adult levels of both AR were found in most medial telencephalic, hypothalamic, and posterior tegmental areas. Decreases in both receptors densities with age were prominent in ventral and posterior telencephalic, pretectal, ventral thalamic, hypothalamic, and tegmental brain regions. Immunohistochemical data were well correlated with autoradiography and demonstrated the presence of alpha(2A), alpha(2C), beta(1), and beta(2) AR subtype-like immunoreactivity. Both the neuronal (perikaryal or dendritic) and the glial localization of receptors was revealed. The localization and age-dependent alterations in alpha(2) and beta AR were parallel to plasticity mechanisms, such as cell proliferation in periventricular thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In addition, the biochemical characteristics, distribution pattern, and neuronal or glial specificity of the receptors in teleost brain support a similar profile of noradrenergic transmission in vertebrate brain evolution.",

The two former phases are made of phosphatidylcholine as found in biomembranes and differ each other in end-capping of free propylamino residues whereas the latter is made of single-chain phosphatidylcholine analogues. On IAM-PC-DD2 we found that structurally unrelated neutral compounds give a single correlation between logk' values and the respective octanol/water partition coefficients (logP), as previously observed on IAM-PC-MG phase. This was not observed on the IAM-PC-DD phase. IAM chromatography was performed at a pH of the aqueous eluent (7.0) close to the physiological pH 7.4. Retention on all IAM phases showed a biphasic pattern, being proportional to logP(N) (lipophilicity of neutral forms) for more lipophilic congeners (logP(N)>1.90), and quite constant for the others. The comparison of beta-blocker retention with that of neutral compounds on IAM-PC-MG and IAM-PC-DD2 suggests that they can interact with phospholipids as strongly or more strongly than neutral isolipophilic compounds, despite their being more than 98% in their ionized form. Therefore, we hypothesize that electrostatic interactions play a pivotal role in the interactions between beta-blockers and membrane phospholipids.",

The patient underwent a negative laparoscopy before the thyroid dysfunction was diagnosed. There is no evidence that bariatric surgery carries a greater risk of postoperative thyrotoxicosis than any other non-thyroid operation. Many of the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, however, are similar to those of other surgery-related complications, and it should be immediately considered in the differential diagnosis of a postoperative bariatric patient with tachycardia and fever. Failure to rule out this condition may lead to unnecessary surgery.", 
    "49": "Hypertension is the most common chronic disease in the Western world, and while there are many drug classes from which to choose therapy, only 34% of North Americans currently have their blood pressure controlled. The potential clinical utility of pharmacogenomics in helping to guide antihypertensive drug therapy selection is described. The hypertension pharmacogenetics literature is reviewed, which highlights that only a small fraction of the genes that likely contribute to antihypertensive response have been studied to date. The genes for alpha-adducin (diuretic response), the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta-blocker response) and angiotensinogen (response to multiple drug classes) are among the genes with the most compelling data (based on replication) as pharmacogenetic candidates. Potential limitations of current studies are also discussed. These include reliance on clinic blood pressure, which is probably a suboptimal response phenotype, and the relatively small sample sizes of most studies to date. Also discussed is the relatively simplistic genetic approach that has been taken, which has focused largely on a single gene or single nucleotide polymorphism within a gene. Multiple ways to overcome these potential limitations are described. Hypertension pharmacogenomics holds tremendous potential for providing a mechanism by which management of hypertensive patients might be improved, and future studies should help move this field towards its clinical potential.",

Despite significant advances in pharmacologic and interventional therapies, 25% of men and 38% of women still die within 1 year of the acute event. Beta-blockers have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients after an AMI. National guidelines recommend that all patients with AMI may be started on beta-blocker therapy and continued indefinitely, unless absolutely contraindicated or not tolerated. However, a substantial portion of eligible AMI survivors are not prescribed beta-blockers in the hospital after an acute event or upon hospital discharge. In addition, patients with AMI are often treated with agents whose long-term use has not been shown effective and for which optimal dosing has not been defined. This paper will discuss the background of beta-blocker use for the treatment of AMI, discuss the rationale for choosing specific agents, and present protocols for initiating or switching to evidence-based therapies.", 
    "51": "Lutheran (Lu) blood group and basal cell adhesion molecule (B-CAM) antigens reside on two glycoprotein (gp) isoforms Lu and Lu(v13) that belong to the Ig superfamily and differ only by the size of their cytoplasmic tail. Lu/B-CAM gps have been recognized as laminin alpha5 receptors on red blood cells and epithelial cells in multiple tissues. It has been shown that sickle red cells exhibit enhanced adhesion to laminin alpha5 when intracellular cAMP is up-regulated by physiological stimuli such as epinephrine and that this signaling pathway is protein kinase A- and Lu/B-CAM-dependent. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the phosphorylation status of Lu/B-CAM gps and their adhesion function to laminin alpha5. We showed that Lu isoform was phosphorylated in sickle red cells as well as in erythroleukemic K562 and epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and that this phosphorylation is enhanced by different stimuli of the PKA pathway. Lu gp is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, casein kinase II, and PKA at serines 596, 598, and 621, respectively. Alanine substitutions of serines 596 and 598 abolished phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and casein kinase II, respectively, but had no effect on adhesion of K562 cells to laminin under flow conditions. Conversely, mutation of serine 621 prevented phosphorylation by PKA and dramatically reduced cell adhesion. Furthermore, stimulation of K562 cells by epinephrine increased Lu gp phosphorylation by PKA and enhanced adhesion to laminin. It is postulated that modulation of the phosphorylation state of Lu gp might be a critical factor for the sickle red cells adhesiveness to laminin alpha5 in sickle cell disease.", 
    "52": "Phenoxypropanolamines with 1-oxo-isoindoline and 5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-isoindoline groups at the para position were synthesized. beta1, beta2-Adrenergic receptor binding affinities for the synthesized compounds were tested and compared with propranolol and atenolol. It was found that the incorporation of para-amidic functionality within the 1-oxo-isoindoline ring and 5,6-dimethoxy-1-oxo-isoindoline ring system led to a high degree of cardioselectivity in the phenoxypropanolamines. Two of the compounds and possessed beta1-adrenergic receptor affinity comparable with that of atenolol and both showed a better cardioselectivity than atenolol. Both and are undergoing further pharmacological evaluation.", 
    "53": "Diabetes impairs endothelium dependent vasodilation, but the mechanism of endothelium independent dilation is not well understood. In the present study, we examined the effect of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes on the vasomotor of small coronary artery and the activity of voltage-dependent K+ channel of vascular smooth muscle cells in STZ rats [corrected] using the videomicroscopy and patch clamp method. STZ-induced diabetes appeared to [corrected] reduce the vasodilation induced by beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l), and adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l) respectively (isoproterenol: 44.2 +/- 6.7% vs. 82.5 +/- 4.8%, and forskolin: 54.4 +/- 4.5% vs. 94.3 +/- 2.4%). 4-AP, a Kv channel blocker of VSMC, further decreased dilation to isoproterenol (44.2 +/- 6.7% vs. 10.2 +/- 3.5%) and forskolin (54.4 +/- 4.5% vs. 13.8 +/- 11.0%) significantly. Whole cell K+ current recording demonstrated that STZ-induced diabetes decreased isoproterenol and forskolin-induced K+ current (ISO: 55.6 +/- 7.8 pA/pF vs. 28.4 +/- 3.4 pA/pF, forskolin: 61.3 +/- 9.8 pA/pF vs. 32.4 +/- 3.4 pA/pF). 4-AP further reduced the decreased K+ current (ISO: 28.4 +/- 3.4 pA/pF vs. 14.3 +/- 2.1 pA/pF, forskolin: 32.4 +/- 3.4 pA/pF vs. 14.8 +/- 2.9 pA/pF). These results indicated that STZ-induced diabetes impaired cAMP mediated dilation of small coronary artery and suppressed the Kv channel activity of vascular smooth muscle cells. Kv channel of VSMC was shown to play a determinate role reducing dilation of small coronary artery in STZ rats.", 
    "54": "Acute aortic dissection is a medical emergency with high morbidity and mortality requiring emergent diagnosis and therapy. Rapid advances in noninvasive imaging technology have facilitated the early diagnosis of this condition and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any patient with chest, back, or abdominal pain. Emergent surgery is the treatment for patients with type A dissection while optimal medical therapy is appropriate in patients with uncomplicated type B dissection. Adequate beta-blockade is the cornerstone of medical therapy. Patients who survive acute aortic dissection need long-term medical therapy with beta-blockers and statins and appropriate serial imaging follow-up. Future advances in this field include biomarkers in the early diagnosis of acute aortic dissection and presymptomatic diagnosis with genetic screening. Overall patients with aortic dissection are at high risk for an adverse outcome and need to be managed aggressively in hospital and long term with frequent follow-up.", 
    "55": "Portal hypertension as a consequence of liver cirrhosis is responsible for serious complications such as variceal bleeding, ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. Successful pharmacological treatment of portal hypertension can prevent the risk of the variceal bleeding, and contribute to reduce the morbidity and mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. To identify the effect of drugs on portal hypertension, portal pressure was evaluated accurately before and after the drug administration. The hepatic venous pressure gradient has been accepted as the gold-standard method for assessing the severity of portal hypertension and the response to drug treatment. The mean hepatic venous pressure gradient was 15.1+/-5.4 mmHg in Korean cirrhotic patients who had experienced variceal bleeding. Non-selective beta blockers are the treatment of choice for primary and secondary prevention of variceal bleeding. The dose of propranolol should be subsequently adjusted until the resting heart rate had been reduced by 25% or less than 55 beats per minute. It has been reported that the optimal dose of propranolol is variable due to racial differences in cardiovascular receptor sensitivity. In Korean patients with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis, the mean required dose of propranolol to reach target heart rate was 165 mg (range; 80-280 mg). This review covers mainly the results of the pharmacological therapy of portal hypertension in Korean cirrhotic patients.",

    "58": "Propranolol and primidone reduce limb tremor (Level A). Alprazolam, atenolol, gabapentin (monotherapy), sotalol, and topiramate are probably effective in reducing limb tremor (Level B). Limited studies suggest that propranolol reduces head tremor (Level B). Clonazepam, clozapine, nadolol, and nimodipine possibly reduce limb tremor (Level C). Botulinum toxin A may reduce hand tremor but is associated with dose-dependent hand weakness (Level C). Botulinum toxin A may reduce head tremor (Level C) and voice tremor (Level C), but breathiness, hoarseness, and swallowing difficulties may occur in the treatment of voice tremor. Chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) (Level C) and thalamotomy (Level C) are highly efficacious in reducing tremor. Each procedure carries a small risk of major complications. Some adverse events from DBS may resolve with time or with adjustment of stimulator settings. There is insufficient evidence regarding the surgical treatment of head and voice tremor and the use of gamma knife thalamotomy (Level U). Additional prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to better determine the efficacy and side effects of pharmacologic and surgical treatments of ET.",

We performed additional post hoc analyses of pooled data from these studies to compare further the efficacy of the two treatments. The studies used identical 3-month, parallel group, randomized, observer-masked and patient-masked, multicenter designs. Patients with a baseline IOP > or = 24 mm Hg were randomized to either the 2% dorzolamide/0.5% timolol combination eye drops twice daily (n = 273) or 0.005% latanoprost eye drops once daily (n = 271). The IOP measurements were made at 8 AM, 10 AM, 2 PM, and 4 PM at the baseline visit and then on each of the 3 monthly assessment days. The following measures were analyzed on a post hoc basis: 1) percentages of patients meeting target levels of IOP reduction; 2) mean IOP reduction in those patients with high IOP (> or =30 mmHg) at baseline; 3) mean IOP at each of the assessment time points during a day. A total of 259 patients in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 268 patients in the latanoprost group were included in the efficacy analysis. At 3 months, both treatments showed similar efficacy with regard to the percentages of patients who achieved target levels of IOP reduction (e.g., 40% IOP reduction in 15% of dorzolamide/timolol combination patients and 13% of latanoprost patients), mean IOP reduction in those patients with high IOP at baseline (dorzolamide/ timolol combination, 12.5 mmHg, latanoprost, 12.6 mmHg), and mean IOP at each time point during the day. By the measures used in this analysis, the dorzolamide/timolol combination and latanoprost were equally effective at lowering IOP in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.", 
    "78": "Although it is known that ganglion cell death causes loss of vision in glaucoma, the pathogenesis of the disease is complex, probably involving an initial ischemic insult to the ganglion cell axons and glial cells with the ganglion cell bodies eventually being affected. It may therefore be necessary to blunt many stages in the pathogenesis of the disease to obtain a clinically effective neuroprotective strategy. In animal experiments, one cause of ganglion cell death in ischemia is an overactivation of glutamate receptors and a subsequent rise in intracellular levels of sodium and calcium ions as well as a generation of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, optic nerve death in ischemia is mainly caused by an influx of sodium and reversal of the sodium/calcium exchanger, which leads to a rise in intracellular calcium. Thus, a substance that reduces the influx of sodium will protect the ganglion cell axon, and if it also reduces calcium influx and/or acts as an antioxidant it will protect the ganglion cell body in addition. Of all antiglaucoma drugs, only beta-blockers have both calcium and sodium channel blocking activity, with betaxolol being the most efficacious of those analyzed. In addition, of the tested ophthalmic beta-blockers only metipranolol has powerful antioxidant properties. Moreover, laboratory studies on rats have shown that topically applied beta-blockers attenuate ischemic injury to ganglion cells by mechanisms that do not appear to involve an action on beta-receptors. Thus, of the substances used to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma, beta-blockers have unique additional characteristics that also give them the capacity to act as neuroprotectants.", 
    "79": "I.V. administration of serotonin (2 mg kg(-1)) to alert rabbits changed the ileal, caecal, and colon motility including excitatory and inhibitory components. Initial rise of contractile activity was quickly replaced by its diminishing followed by a longer enhancement of the motility, and then by the final, inhibitory, phase. Under blockade of beta1- and beta2-adrenoreceptors with propranolol inhibition of ileal and caecal contractile activity with serotonin was preserved, the effect of circulating catecholamines on beta-adrenoreceptors of smooth muscle cells seems to be excluded as a cause of the serotonin inhibitory effect. In conditions of blockade of pre- and postsynaptic alpha-adrenoreceptors with phentolamine, there was no significant diminishing of the contractile activity in the ileo-caecal zone below the initial level induced by serotonin in control experiments. Intensification of the ileo-caecal zone contractile activity under the effect of serotonin persisted in conditions of blockade of muscarinic cholinoreceptors and was proceeding with participation of non-cholinergic excitatory mechanism.", 
    "80": "To confirm that alpha1, beta adrenoceptor antagonists and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) have different abilities to attenuate progressive cardiac hypertrophy despite their comparable lowering of blood pressure, we compared the effect of these agents alone or in combination on hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy. Eight-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were divided into 7 groups. Single administration of doxazosin, atenolol, or losartan, or half-dose combinations of these drugs were given orally for 6 weeks. The control group did not receive any drugs. The heart weight-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and left ventricular BNP mRNA expression were measured after 6-week administration. Blood pressure did not differ among the drug-treated groups, all of which showed lower blood pressure than the control group. The HW/BW and LVMI of the drug-treated groups, except the doxazosin group, were lower than in the control group. Moreover, the LVMI values of the groups receiving losartan were significantly lower than those in the groups without losartan (p < 0.05). Plasma BNP of the drug-treated groups was lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The left ventricular BNP mRNA expression of the drug-treated groups, except the doxazosin group, was lower than that in the control group. The atenolol group showed a higher level of BNP mRNA than the groups receiving losartan monotherapy or combination therapies (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the ARB had the strongest attenuating effect on the development of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy, and the alpha1 and beta adrenergic receptor blockers were more effective in combination than as monotherapies in SHR.", 
    "81": "The glucose-induced insulin secretion is fine-tuned by numerous factors. To systematically identify insulinotropic factors, we optimized a primary beta-cell-based functional assay to monitor intracellular Ca2+ flux ([Ca2+]i). By this assay system, we successfully identified several insulinotropic peptides including cholecystokinin, gastrin releasing peptide, vasopressin, and oxytocin from tissue extracts. Screening of an assortment of chemical compounds, we determined three novel insulin secretagogues: N-arachidonylglycine (NAGly), 3beta-(2-diethylamino-ethoxy) androstenone hydrochloride (U18666A), and 4-androstene-3,17-dione. The NAGly increased [Ca2+]i through stimulation of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and it was dependent on extracellular glucose level. On the other hand, U18666A and 4-androstene-3,17-dione increased [Ca2+]i in the presence of K ATP channel opener diazoxide while it was inhibited by the presence of Ca2+ channel blocker nitrendipine, suggesting that their effects are independent of K ATP channel. These unique features will be useful for further development of insulinotropic factors and drugs for treating type 2 diabetes.", 
    "82": "The electrochemical behaviour of acidic and neutral pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) was studied by cyclic voltammetry and pulse voltammetric techniques on mercury, carbon nanotube paste, carbon paste and gold electrodes.

An enrichment step of approximately two orders of magnitude was performed by a solid-phase extraction procedure (SPE) in order to concentrate the samples. The developed method was optimized and tested on spiked river water samples.", 
    "83": "A predictive approach seems useful to identify pharmaceuticals in the environment and give an idea of overall levels of contamination, so as to restrict monitoring to those molecules most likely to be contaminants. We propose an approach based on two parts. The first is to rank the molecules according to the predicted environmental loads; the second is to refine the list by analysing the pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants (STPs) and comparing the concentrations with levels previously measured in surface water. This approach identified a restricted group of priority pollutants (ofloxacin, furosemide, atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, carbamazepine, ibuprofen, spiramycin, bezafibrate, erythromycin, lincomycin and clarithromycin) in the aquatic environment in Italy, for further studies and monitoring.", 
    "84": "Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in the environment lately have been acknowledged to constitute a health risk for humans and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Human and veterinary applications are the main sources of PhACs in the environment and the major pathways are excretion and discharge to the environment through sewage treatment plants (STPs). In this study, the occurrence and fate of selected human PhACs belonging to different therapeutic classes (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, anti-epileptics, antibiotics and beta-blockers) were investigated in a small river in the very south of Sweden. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the impact of a high and rather constant load in sewage influent on downstream concentrations and whether substances that are metabolized to a high degree in humans also show a low persistency in a natural aquatic environment. Water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the STP, in a series of dammed reservoirs leading to discharge into the H\u00f6je River in Sweden, and at several locations in the river downstream of the outfall. After enrichment by solid-phase extraction, the compounds were analyzed using GC-MS (methylated derivatives) or LC-MS/MS. In addition to the targeted pharmaceuticals, GC-MS analysis of the samples revealed the presence of other sewage-related pollutants (triclosan, caffeine, flame-retardants, antioxidants) and these results where included for comparison. Removal efficiencies were calculated in the STP and found to display a wide range with numerous species surviving treatment at greater than half their influent concentrations, including diclofenac, the anti-epileptic carbamazepine, a beta-blocker (propanolol), and antibiotics trimetoprim and sulfamethoxazole. Low removals were also observed for Tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (flame retardant), BHT-aldehyde (oxidation product of BHT) and synthetic musk (HHCB). The concentrations of chloride (Cl(-)) and boron (B) were used as natural inert tracers to estimate the relative extent of dilution of PhACs measured in the effluent of the STP on concentrations measured further downstream. Based on spatial trends of concentrations (recalculated to reflect a hypothetical scenario with no dilution), ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen and dicofenac were shown to be subject to significant abiotic or biotic transformations or physical sequestration in the river. The beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propanolol, the antibiotics trimetoprim and sulfametoxazole, and carbamazepine demonstrated a high degree of persistence. Fluctuations in the concentration of carbamazepine and gemfibrozil were observed along the series of reservoirs and within the river and are hypothesized to be due to release of parent compound from glucuronides. Several of the investigated substances (metaprolol, propanolol and carbamazepin) that exhibit low excretion rates as parent compounds demonstrate a surprising persistence in the aquatic environment. It is concluded that pharmaceutical substances with a high metabolic rate in humans (low excretion rate) do not necessarily induce a short lifetime in aquatic environments. Results from this study emphasize the need for a broader view on the concept of persistence that accounts for loading rates, in addition to removal mechanisms (e.g., transformation, volatility and physical sequestration by solids), under a variety of spatial and temporal scales.", 
    "85": "Catecholinergic ventricular tachycardia is an adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia. It occurs in infancy and is responsible for syncope and sudden death in the absence of any morphological cardiac abnormality. Without treatment the mortality in catecholinergic ventricular tachycardia is very high. We report genetic and clinical data from 25 cases of catecholinergic ventricular tachycardia referred with syncope (n=19) or resuscitated sudden death during exercise (n=6). A family history from the 25 families identified 41 apparent subjects considered as being clinically affected, with an average age of 30 +/- 10 years (11 to 62 years). Analysis of the RyR2 gene showed mutations in 13 of the 25 cases and in 39 of apparent subjects. With betablocker treatment (nadolol: 1.6 +/- 0.15 mg/kg), 96% of patients remained asymptomatic over an average follow-up of between 7.5 +/- 1.5 years, although some of them continued to display polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles on exercise. Nevertheless, 12% of the cases suffered sudden death or further syncope during follow-up. An automatic defibrillator was implanted in 2 patients who had a RyR2 mutation. High dose betablockers are effective in preventing serious rhythm disturbance in children. In adolescence, implanting an automatic defibrillator should be discussed in cases with a history of syncope or resuscitated sudden death. We confirm the importance of genetic studies in these families at high risk of sudden death.",

Randomized clinical trial data, both in heart failure and post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients, have shown differences in mortality benefits in addition to a variable effect on arrhythmias and sudden death. Carvedilol, a third-generation beta-blocker with proven clinical benefit in the management of heart failure and post-MI patients, has properties that may make it an effective antiarrhythmic agent. This paper reviews the current clinical arrhythmia data available for carvedilol from large-scale clinical trials and small studies. The trial evidence demonstrates that carvedilol therapy can be an effective adjunctive rate-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation, prevent mortality in patients with heart failure or post-MI with left ventricular dysfunction, with or without atrial fibrillation, and reduce its onset and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death.",

Recent trials have contributed to the knowledge base of critical therapies for the treatment of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure as it relates to arrhythmic and sudden cardiac death. Both pharmacologic and device therapies can reduce sudden cardiac death. The trials discussed in this paper have identified the pharmacologic and device interventions that are likely to improve the length and quality of life of the patient with left ventricular dysfunction and reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death. The mortality and anti-arrhythmic effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers have been confirmed in large-scale controlled clinical heart failure trials. Recent trials have evaluated which agents are most effective and which patients will derive the most benefit from device therapy in terms of the reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death and in the amelioration of heart failure. The recent data from the Carvedilol or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) and the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) are discussed as the latest in the series of landmark studies that have shaped the current approaches to treating patients with heart failure and that have altered the heart failure treatment paradigm.", 
    "96": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure develops commonly in older individuals and its prevalence increases as heart failure severity progresses. Because of deteriorating hemodynamics, patients with heart failure are at increased risk for developing AF and, conversely, AF in heart failure patients is associated with adverse hemodynamic changes. AF is believed to increase the mortality risk in heart failure, which may be minimized by treatment that includes the control of ventricular rate, prevention of thrombotic events, and conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Clinical guidelines recommend amiodarone or dofetilide in heart failure patients, but these drugs have certain drawbacks, such as an increased risk for bradyarrhythmias with amiodarone and proarrhythmic reaction with dofetilide. Some but not all clinical trials have suggested that rate control should be the primary therapeutic goal in high-risk heart failure patients with AF and, if unsuccessful, followed by rhythm control. The former is effectively achieved with rate-lowering beta-blockers alone or in combination with digoxin. Recent studies evaluating the effects of combination carvedilol/digoxin therapy demonstrate synergistic effects between the two drugs. This combination therapy decreased heart failure symptoms, effectively reduced ventricular rate, and improved ventricular function to a greater extent compared with that produced by either drug alone. Although digoxin alone is an effective heart failure treatment, its use as a single rate-control therapy is often ineffective in heart failure patients with AF associated with rapid ventricular response. Carvedilol is effective, alone or in combination, with digoxin in such heart failure patients with AF, and has been shown to reduce mortality risk in patients with chronic heart failure during prolonged therapy.", 
    "97": "Beta-Adrenergic blockers have a wide spectrum of action for controlling cardiac arrhythmias that is larger than initially thought. Data from the past several decades indicate that, as an antiarrhythmic class, beta-blockers remain among the very few pharmacologic agents that reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death, prolong survival, and ameliorate symptoms caused by arrhythmias in patients with cardiac disease. As a class of compounds, beta-blockers have a fundamental pharmacologic property that attenuates the effects of competitive adrenergic receptors. However, the net clinical effects of the different beta-receptor blockers may vary quantitatively because of variations in associated intrinsic sympathomimetic agonism and in their intrinsic potency for binding to beta-receptors. These individual compounds also differ in their selectivity for beta(1)- and beta(2)-receptors. Metoprolol is a beta(1)-selective blocker, whereas carvedilol is a nonselective beta(1)- and beta(2)-blocker, an antioxidant, and has a propensity to inhibit alpha(1)-receptors and endothelin. Evolving data from controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials suggest that there are clinically significant differences among this class of drugs. Recent evidence also suggests that the antiarrhythmic actions of certain beta-receptor blockers such as carvedilol and metoprolol extend beyond the ventricular tissue to encompass atrial cells and help maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation, especially in combination with potent antifibrillatory agents such as amiodarone. This introduction provides a current perspective on these newer developments in the understanding of the antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory actions of beta-blockers.", 
    "98": "Patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction (MI) are at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias that often cause sudden cardiac death. It is believed that sympathetic overactivity in the peri-infarction period may alter the electrophysiology and structure of the myocardium, thus placing these patients at risk of developing rhythm disturbances. A number of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies have been shown to reduce the risk of post-MI mortality, including sudden cardiac death. beta-Adrenergic blockers are recommended for all post-MI patients without contraindications because of overwhelming clinical evidence of their benefit in reducing mortality in this patient population. Recent clinical trials of implantable cardioverter defibrillators have provided compelling support that they are effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. In addition, several studies have shown that combination therapy with beta-blockers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators have synergistic effects that optimize the benefits of both therapies.", 
    "99": "Sympathetic nervous system overactivity has been linked to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death. It has been hypothesized that the extent and nature of the arrhythmogenic effect of sympathetic stimulation depends on the underlying myocardial substrate, the mechanism of the arrhythmia, and the integrated effects of sympathetic stimulation in the particular individual circumstance. Multiple direct and indirect mechanisms of adrenergic action on the heart may benefit from the known antiarrhythmic actions of beta-blocker therapy and other interventions that decrease sympathetic tone. The antiarrhythmic mechanism of beta-blockade (and possibly alpha-blockade) will depend on the specific mechanism of the individual arrhythmia and will differ for those arrhythmias caused by tachycardia and ischemia, those caused by reentry and promoted by decreased conduction velocity and shortened refractoriness, and those caused by early or delayed afterdepolarizations, usually in the context of prolonged action potential duration. Antagonism of cardiac adrenergic activity by beta-blockade in particular is the best-established drug therapy to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.", 
    "100": "Earlier studies have implicated the adverse effects of beta- and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Because carvedilol is both a nonselective beta- and alpha1-selective adrenergic receptor-blocking agent, we hypothesized that pretreatment with carvedilol would convert the actions of epinephrine to that of a selective alpha2-agonist.", 
    "101": "Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats weighing approximately 500 g. Animals were randomized to 4 groups of 5 animals each: (1) placebo pretreatment and epinephrine treatment, (2) carvedilol pretreatment and placebo treatment, (3) carvedilol pretreatment and epinephrine treatment, and (4) placebo pretreatment and placebo treatment. Carvedilol (50 microg/kg) was injected as a bolus into the right atrium 15 minutes before VF was induced. VF was untreated for 8 minutes, after which CPR (chest compression and mechanical ventilation) was begun. Epinephrine (30 microg/kg) was injected into the right atrium 2 minutes after the start of CPR. Electrical defibrillation was attempted after 14 minutes of VF.", 
    "102": "All but 2 animals were successfully resuscitated. Approximately equivalent increases in coronary perfusion pressure from 23 +/- 1 mm Hg to 30 +/- 3 mm Hg were observed after the injection of epinephrine independently of carvedilol pretreatment. Carvedilol pretreatment followed by epinephrine treatment reduced early postresuscitation ventricular ectopy (116 +/- 147 vs 834 +/- 380, P < .01) and minimized increases in arterial blood lactate at 5 minutes after resuscitation (10.9 +/- 2.1 mmol/L vs 17.4 +/- 3.5 mmol/L, P < .01). The postresuscitation cardiac index measured 4 hours later was increased (307 +/- 43 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) vs 210 +/- 6 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1), P < .05). Left ventricular diastolic pressures were decreased (6 +/- 1 vs 14 +/- 1 mm Hg, P < .05). Animals pretreated with carvedilol survived longer (71 +/- 1 vs 45 +/- 22 hours, P < .05) and with less postresuscitation neurologic deficit.", 
    "103": "After beta- and alpha1-adrenergic blockade with carvedilol before inducing cardiac arrest, epinephrine administered during CPR yielded better postresuscitation myocardial and neurologic functions and significantly increased postresuscitation survival.", 
    "104": "We examined whether the beta2-adrenoceptor agonists fenoterol and salbutamol, the beta3-adrenoceptor agonists CL 316243 and ZD 2079, and the agonists of the low-affinity state of beta-adrenoceptors, cyanopindolol and CGP 12177 block alpha1-adrenoceptors in that concentration range in which they relax the human pulmonary and rat mesenteric arteries preconstricted with phenylephrine 10 microM and 1 microM, respectively. For quantification of vasodilatation pEC25 values and for the antagonism toward alpha1-adrenoceptors, pA2 values were determined. We found that in the rat mesenteric artery, (1) the pEC25 values of the beta-adrenoceptor ligands resemble their respective pA2 values (difference < or = 0.9 log units), and (2) the order of potencies is the same for both parameters, ie, cyanopindolol approximately fenoterol > CGP 12177 > salbutamol > ZD 2079 > CL 316243. In the human pulmonary artery, (1) the pEC25 values are slightly lower (by 0.6-1.3 log units) than their respective pA2 values, and (2) the rank order of potencies is the same for both parameters. In conclusion, the present study suggests that ligands of beta2-adrenoceptors and of non-beta1-non-beta2-adrenoceptors relax rat and human vessels preconstricted with phenylephrine or norepinephrine mainly through their alpha1-adrenolytic effects. Hence, for the investigation of the role of beta-adrenoceptors in vessels, the constrictor agent should be chosen with great caution.", 
    "105": "The baroreceptor-heart period reflex was assessed in conscious, freely behaving rat pups on postnatal days 6 and 14. The baroreceptor-heart period reflex was elicited using the alpha1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine to increase blood pressure and the vasodilator, sodium nitroprusside, to decrease blood pressure. The autonomic effects of the baroreceptor manipulations were determined using pharmacological autonomic blockade. The data demonstrate that vasoconstriction produces a potent baroreflex-mediated bradycardia as early as postnatal day 6, which had previously been demonstrated only in anesthetized pups. In the anesthetized pup, the bradycardia is mediated by vagal activation, while we demonstrate that both vagal activation and sympathetic withdrawal occur in unanesthetized animals. In addition, the results replicate previous findings in rats demonstrating minimal cardiac sympathetic activation or vagal withdrawal following vasodilation during the first week of life, but substantial baroreflex-mediated tachycardia by the second week.", 
    "106": "Compared with the adult, neonatal heart muscle is less sensitive to deactivation by acidic pH. We hypothesized that expression of slow skeletal troponin I (ssTnI), the embryonic isoform, in adult heart would help maintain left ventricular (LV) systolic function during respiratory hypercapnia. We assessed LV function by transthoracic 2D-targeted M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiography in transgenic (TG) mice in which cardiac TnI was replaced with ssTnI and in nontransgenic (NTG) littermates. Anesthetized mice were ventilated with either 100% oxygen or 35% CO2 balanced with oxygen. Arterial blood pH with 35% CO2 decreased to the same levels in both groups of animals. In the absence of propranolol, the LV fractional shortening was higher in TG compared with NTG mice throughout most of the experimental protocol. LV diastolic function was impaired in TG compared with NTG mice both at 100% oxygen and 35% CO2 because E-to-A wave ratio of mitral flow was significantly lower, and E-wave deceleration time and LV isovolumic relaxation time were longer in TG compared with NTG mice. When compensatory mechanisms that occur through stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors during hypercapnia were blocked by continuous perfusion with propranolol, we found that NTG mice died within 3 to 4 minutes after switching to 35% CO2, whereas TG mice survived. Our experiments demonstrate the first evidence that specific replacement of cardiac TnI with ssTnI has a protective effect on the LV systolic function during hypercapnic acidosis in situ.", 
    "107": "Osteoporosis is one of the major health problems in our modern world. Especially, disuse (unloading) osteoporosis occurs commonly in bedridden patients, a population that is rapidly increasing due to aging-associated diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying such unloading-induced pathological bone loss have not yet been fully understood. Since sympathetic nervous system could control bone mass, we examined whether unloading-induced bone loss is controlled by sympathetic nervous tone. Treatment with beta-blocker, propranolol, suppressed the unloading-induced reduction in bone mass. Conversely, beta-agonist, isoproterenol, reduced bone mass in loaded mice, and under such conditions, unloading no longer further reduced bone mass. Analyses on the cellular bases indicated that unloading-induced reduction in the levels of osteoblastic cell activities, including mineral apposition rate, mineralizing surface, and bone formation rate, was suppressed by propranolol treatment and that isoproterenol-induced reduction in these levels of bone formation parameters was no longer suppressed by unloading. Unloading-induced reduction in the levels of mineralized nodule formation in bone marrow cell cultures was suppressed by propranolol treatment in vivo. In addition, loss of a half-dosage in the dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene suppressed the unloading-induced bone loss and reduction in mineralized nodule formation. Unloading-induced increase in the levels of osteoclastic activities such as osteoclast number and surface as well as urinary deoxypyridinoline was all suppressed by the treatment with propranolol. These observations indicated that sympathetic nervous tone mediates unloading-induced bone loss through suppression of bone formation by osteoblasts and enhancement of resorption by osteoclasts.",

We report a case of bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma in a 55-year-old, otherwise healthy individual, and discuss the different ways the condition may present. The anatomic and pathophysiologic progression leading to an event of angle closure is discussed and treatment modalities available to the Emergency Physician are presented.", 
    "109": "Carvedilol a beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties raises high expectations in therapy of ischemia. In this study the effect of carvedilol on neuronal survival after transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils was investigated. The role of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) in this process was evaluated. Our data indicated that carvedilol administered subcutaneously in a dose of 7 or 70 mg/kg b.w. directly after 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia protects significant population of neurons in hippocampal area CA1, but has no effect after induction of prolonged 10 min ischemia. Carvedilol significantly decreased PARP activity in hippocampus that was markedly increased after both 15 min and 4 days of reperfusion following 5 min of ischemia. Moreover, carvedilol prevented NAD+ depletion after ischemic-reperfusion insult. These results indicated that carvedilol protects neurons against death and suggested that suppression of PARP activity during reperfusion could be involved in this process.", 
    "110": "In this study, the effects of carvedilol, antihypertensive (alpha-beta blocker) agent with antiproliferative and antioxidative properties, on slowing down of chronic renal failure (CRF) progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy were examined.",

Systolic blood pressure was measured every two weeks, renal blood flow (RBF), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were determined at Weeks 6 and 12, creatinine clearance and proteinuria at Weeks -3 (see measurements), 6 and 12. The rats were sacrificed at Weeks 6 and 12 after the second ADR injection. Glomerular sclerosis, tubulointerstitial and blood vessel changes were determined by semiquantitative scoring.", 
    "113": "Carvedilol decreased systolic blood pressure. It decreased RVR and MAP, and increased RBF significantly. Carvedilol also significantly decreased interstitial infiltration in the early phase of the study, slowed down the development of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and decreased blood vessel changes. The hemodynamic and morphological effects of carvedilol were associated with slowing down the CRF progression as well as a mild decrease in proteinuria. Captopril addition to carvedilol improved its effects especially on prevention of tubulointerstitial changes.",

    "115": "Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for colorectal cancer. It is suggested that 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a tobacco-specific nitrosamine, mediates the carcinogenic action of cigarette smoking by promoting cancer growth. In the present study, the proliferative response of a cultured colon cancer cell line HT-29 to NNK was determined. It was found that NNK dose-dependently stimulated HT-29 cell proliferation. In this regard, the stimulatory action of NNK was abolished by atenolol and ICI 118,551, a beta1- and beta2-selective antagonist, respectively. In addition, cell growth was stimulated by the nonselective adrenergic agonist, noradrenaline, and more effectively by the beta-selective agonist, isoproterenol. The second message cyclic AMP level for beta-adrenoceptor activation was elevated by isoproterenol and NNK treatment. These agents also up-regulated cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression, and prostaglandin E2 release. Beta2-adrenoceptor blockade with ICI 118,551, in contrast, significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression, cytosolic phospholipase A2 expression and prostaglandin E2 release induced by NNK and isoproterenol. To conclude, it is proposed that NNK stimulates HT-29 cell proliferation through beta-adrenoceptors, preferentially beta2 receptors. Activation of the beta-adrenoceptors, and the consequent cyclic AMP elevation coupled with the downstream arachidonic acid pathway, is perhaps an important mechanistic cascade in the promotion of colon cancer growth. These findings partly elucidate the carcinogenic actions of cigarette smoke and shed new light on the novel modulatory role of beta-adrenoceptors in the development of colon cancer.", 
    "116": "We compared the perioperative profiles of patients undergoing unilateral phaeochromocytoma resection performed by open adrenalectomy with those performed by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Data was collected prospectively on 24 patients (12 open, 12 laparoscopic). All patients underwent extensive preoperative medical preparation with phenoxybenzamine and beta-blockers. The final preoperative dose of phenoxybenzamine was similar in each group (laparoscopic 119+/-60 mg/day, open 100+/-25 mg/day). Intraoperative haemodynamic instability was assessed by the requirement for therapeutic intervention. More haemodynamic instability was observed in the laparoscopic group but the differences were not statistically significant. Sodium nitroprusside use to treat hypertension (systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg) was more frequent and the duration of the infusions longer in the laparoscopic group; high dose beta-blocker therapy with atenolol and/or esmolol to treat intraoperative tachycardia (heart rate >90) was also more frequent in the laparoscopic group. The small sample size of the study limited the ability to detect a true difference. Blood loss was greater in the open adrenalectomy group but the difference was not significant. The operating time was significantly longer (236+/-78 vs 147+/-47 min, P<0.01) but the duration of postoperative hospitalization was significantly shorter (5+/-2 vs 11+/-4 days, P<0.01) in the laparoscopic group. Postoperative complications were not significantly different. There were no perioperative deaths. Overall, we observed more haemodynamic instability in patients undergoing laparoscopic resection but were unable to demonstrate a statistically significant difference. In our experience, laparoscopic adrenalectomy has the advantage of a shorter time to discharge from hospital.", 
    "117": "The vasodilative effect of perillaldehyde, one of the major oil components in Perilla frutescens BRITTON, was studied using isolated rat aorta. Perillaldehyde at final concentrations of 0.01 to 1 mM showed dose-dependent relaxation of the aorta contracted by treatment with prostaglandin F2alpha or norepinephrine. Neither the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester nor removal of the aortic endothelium affected the vasodilatation, suggesting that perillaldehyde exerts a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. The vasodilative effect of perillaldehyde was not inhibited by pretreatment with a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol), an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (theophylline), a delayed rectifier K+ channel blocker (tetraethylammonium chloride), or an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker (glibenclamide). However, perillaldehyde showed contrasting effects on vasodilatation of the aorta contracted by an influx of extracellular Ca2+ - perillaldehyde caused little vasodilatation on the aorta contracted by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187, while it inhibited the vasoconstriction induced by treatment with high-concentration K+, which dominantly opened the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. These results suggest that the vasodilative effect of perillaldehyde is derived from blocking the Ca2+ channels.", 
    "118": "Asymptomatic anthracycline-induced cardiac damage (A-CD) is a serious problem among young childhood cancer survivors. The aim of this survey was to assess the current treatment policy in these patients in the Netherlands. A questionnaire was sent to all 136 departments of adult or pediatric cardiology in the Netherlands. It was returned by 61% of the departments. Sixty-six percent of the respondents started medical treatment (ie, an ACE inhibitor and/or a beta-blocker) in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents indicated that their treatment decision was based on published findings in the literature, but none of them referred to studies evaluating the treatment of asymptomatic A-CD. A majority of adult and pediatric cardiologists started medical treatment in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD without knowledge of the benefits and risks of treatment in this patient group. Before ACE inhibitors and/or beta-blockers can be recommended as routine practice in childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD, randomized controlled trials should be performed. Until then, the authors recommend centralizing the treatment of childhood cancer survivors with asymptomatic A-CD in a specialized center to cluster the available knowledge and experience.",

First, data on the use of brain natriuretic peptide as a screening biomarker has shown promise in patients with symptoms of heart failure. For the earliest detection of structural changes, serum propeptide of procollagen type I, a marker of the deposition of type I collagen in the cardiac interstitium provides a noninvasive way to quantify myocardial fibrosis. Treatment options in the past few years have focused heavily on the anti-fibrotic effects of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, perhaps supplanting beta blockers as first-line agents to regress left ventricular hypertrophy. The concept of aldosterone escape is discussed, highlighting the importance of aldosterone inhibitors in these patients. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive review of all antihypertensive classes and their effects on hypertensive heart disease.",

All anti-hypertensive treatments have shown improvement in regressing left ventricular hypertrophy, but inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system possess the most potent anti-fibrotic effects. It is increasingly important for clinicians to identify and manage hypertensive heart disease to prevent increased morbidity and mortality.", 
    "122": "Our objectives were to investigate and compare the effects of supplemental Mg, Trp, vitamin E (vit E), and vitamin C (vit C) on stress responses of pigs undergoing transport simulation. In this study, 126 pigs (25.1 +/- 4.4 kg BW) were allocated to one of the six following treatments: 1) negative control (no supplementation); 2) positive control (i.m. injection with 0.5 mg of carazolol/20 kg BW 12 h before vibration, beta-blocker); 3) Trp (additional amount of 6 g/kg of feed for 5 d, as-fed basis); 4) Mg (3 g/L drinking water for 2 d); 5) vit E (additional amount of 150 mg/kg of feed for 21 d, as-fed basis); 6) or vit C (additional amount of 300 mg/kg of feed for 21 d, as-fed basis). Pigs were treated in groups of three, and each treatment was replicated seven times. Feed and water intake were not different among treatments. Heart rate variables (mean, peak, and minimum heart rate, ventricular ectopic beats, and ST elevation of Channels A and B) and heart rate variability were registered from the night before vibration. Pigs were subjected to vibration in a transport simulator (8 Hz, 3 m/s) for 2 h and allowed to recover for 2 h. Generally, the positive control pigs had the lowest heart rate values (mean, peak, minimum heart rate, ST elevation of Channel A; P < 0.05), whereas Mg and Trp decreased ventricular ectopic beats and ST elevation of Channel B, respectively. The effect of vit C and E as vagal stimulators was clearly visible, whereas carazolol and Mg clearly blocked the sympathetic pathways of the autonomic nervous system. During vibration, the negative control pigs lay the least, and Mg pigs the most (P < 0.05). Salivary cortisol concentrations (taken before and after vibration and after recovery) showed that vit E pigs produced the least cortisol during stress periods. Intermediary metabolites (glucose, lactate, creatine kinase, and NEFA) were analyzed in plasma from blood taken before and after vibration. At the two sampling points, the vit E and Mg pigs had the lowest NEFA concentrations (P < 0.05), and the vit E pigs also had the lowest lactate concentrations before vibration. Urine samples were collected before and after vibration to determine catecholamine concentrations; only negative control pigs had an increase (P = 0.04) in epinephrine concentration, despite large individual variation. In general, these results indicate that the supplementation of Trp, Mg, vit E, or vit C improved coping ability of pigs during vibration comparison with the negative control treatment. A muscular injection of carazolol influenced only the heart rate variables.",

In a retrospective subgroup analysis of the hypertensive subjects of the multicenter double-blind study, REASON (PREterax in Regression of Arterial Stiffness in a ContrOlled Double-BliNd), in which fixed first-line antihypertensive combination therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril (2 mg), and a diuretic, indapamide (0.625 mg), proved significantly more effective than atenolol in normalizing PP, we sought to determine whether perindopril plus indapamide was also more effective than atenolol in lowering CRP levels and, if so, whether this effect correlated with a preferential reduction in PP. At the final visit (12 months) in the 269 patients studied, the decrease in PP was greater, and the proportion of patients with CRP >3 mg/L lower (17.9% versus 28. 9%, P=0.03; adjusted odds ratio, 1.02 to 4.08, P=0.01), in the perindopril plus indapamide group than in the atenolol group. After adjustment for confounders, patients with a baseline CRP >3 mg/L displaying the greatest decrease in PP were more likely (P=0.04) to have a CRP < or =3 mg/L at 12 months. No such relationship was found with systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Perindopril-indapamide combination therapy is more effective than beta-blockade in lowering elevated CRP in hypertensive subjects. This effect is significantly associated with a more effective PP reduction in patients with baseline CRP >3 mg/L.",

Recently, 'the maestro' has become a target for pharmacotherapy of atherothrombotic and diabetic vasculopathies with well known cardio-vascular drugs belonging to the families of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors or beta1-Adrenoceptor antagonists. These drugs became upgraded to a position of the pleiotropic endothelial drugs. It is not a simple verbal change in the nomenclature. It means that these drugs apart from their well defined mechanisms of action, as indicated in their regular names, in addition they act in an unknown mechanism at the level of vascular endothelium preventing angina, myocardial infarction and stroke. Many biochemical events take place in endothelial cells. I chose for a closer inspection the nitric oxide/prostacyclin defensive system to explain the endothelial pleiotropism of the drugs in question. I tried to examine the validity of this conception according to the general rule: in vitro cognitio sed in vivo veritas.", 
    "130": "1. The aim of the present study was to examine the modulator influence of muscarinic M(2) receptors on responses of rat urinary bladder detrusor muscle evoked by endogenous stimuli, i.e. by stimulation of the bladder innervation. 2. Responses were evoked by electrical field stimulation (EFS; 2-20 Hz, 0.8 ms, 60 V) of isolated strip preparations mounted in organ baths. The tension of the muscle strips was recorded digitally. EFS was performed by applying stimulation with either a short duration (5 s) or a longer duration (to reach peak response; approximately 20 s). 3. Effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists (muscarinic M(1)/M(3) receptor selective: 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP); muscarinic M(2) receptor selective: methoctramine), a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) and an adenosine receptor antagonist (8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline) were assessed on contractile activity and on poststimulatory relaxations. 4. Low concentrations of methoctramine (10(-8) m) reduced or tended to reduce the EFS-induced contraction, e.g. at 2 Hz by 12% while methoctramine at 10(-7) m had no significant effect. In addition, in the presence of 4-DAMP (10(-9) m), which tended to inhibit contractions at all frequencies (2-20 Hz; -17 to -25%), methoctramine at 10(-8) and 10(-7) m induced a further reduction of the contractile responses (-5 to -10%; 2-20 Hz). 5. The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (10(-6) m) and the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline (10(-6) m) both increased contractile responses by 9-21% (2-10 Hz, long duration; P < 0.05-0.001) as a consequence of antagonizing relaxatory stimuli. Neither antagonist affected the contractile responses to EFS with the short duration stimulation. Poststimulatory relaxations were reduced by 30-60% (P < 0.05) by propranolol and by 40-60% (P < 0.001) by 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline, but for 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline only after stimulation with the short duration. 6. In the presence of methoctramine (10(-7) m), the 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline-induced increases of the contractile response to long duration EFS were significantly enhanced at 10 Hz (+12 +/- 4%; P < 0.05), whereas no such enhancement of the propranolol inhibitory effect occurred in the presence of methoctramine. However, poststimulatory beta-adrenoceptor-evoked relaxations after short duration EFS were increased by about 35% in the presence of methoctramine, but not those after long duration. 7. Thus, muscarinic M(2) receptor activation inhibits adenosine receptor- and beta-adrenoceptor-evoked relaxations of the rat detrusor muscle. The inhibition occurs via a transient postjunctional mechanism that mainly affects responses with a short latency.", 
    "131": "The purpose of the present paper was to study some of the underlying physical and technical aspects of high-throughput quantitative matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) of small drug molecules. A prototype MALDI-triple quadrupole instrument equipped with a high repetition rate laser was employed. Initially, the detection limits and dynamic ranges for the quantitation of four drugs (quinidine, danofloxacin, ramipril and nadolol) were determined. Internal standards were carefully chosen for each of these analytes in terms of structure similarity and fragmentation pathways. Three organic matrices were tested for these assays, resulting in different crystallization behaviors and measurement reproducibilities. alpha-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid yielded the best results and was subsequently employed for the quantitative determination of all four analytes. Further experiments considered the role of laser energy and pulse rate on the ablated areas as well as ion signals. Light microscope and scanning electron microscope images allowed the examination of the ablated area of the MALDI spots. The images showed convincing evidence that the ablated area was virtually void of crystals after analysis, with no preferential removal of material in the center of the laser's path. Average values for the amount of material ablated were determined to be 3.9+/-0.5% of the total spot size, and as low as 19.5 attomoles of analyte were detectable for our most sensitive analyte, ramipril. It was calculated that, under these assay conditions, it was possible to accurately quantify less than 1 femtomole of all analytes with the use of appropriately pure internal standards. These studies showed very promising results for the quantitative nature of MALDI for small molecules with molecular weights less than 500 Da.", 
    "132": "In order to develop a thermosetting gel-based formulation, the ocular pharmacokinetics of timolol was studied utilizing microdialysis sampling technique after topical administration. A linear microdialysis probe was characterized and implanted in the anterior chamber of a rabbit. Dialysate samples collected from the aqueous humor (AH) were directly injected into the HPLC system without any pre-treatment and no interference was observed in the blank sample. The measured in vitro recovery of the probe was 57.67%; however, the in vivo recovery significantly decreased to 16.78% when assessed by the retrodialysis method, which was used to calculate the timolol concentration in AH. Although in the initial 15 min the drug concentrations in AH were comparable to that of the timolol solution, increased Cmax and significantly improved ocular bioavailability were obtained for the gel. When sodium deoxycholate (DC) was incorporated in the gel as a penetration enhancer, a 2-fold increment in the ocular bioavailability was achieved with an increased Cmax and significantly suspended Tmax. The results demonstrated that microdialysis coupled to HPLC is a powerful tool to investigate the ocular pharmacokinetic, and hence facilitates the design of ophthalmic formulations.", 
    "133": "This study assessed the effects of temperature acclimation on myocardial beta-adrenoceptor density (B(max)) and binding affinity (K(d)) in African catfish (Claris gariepinus) acclimated to 15, 22 and 32 degrees C. B(max) values were not significantly different (P > 0.05) among the three acclimation groups. Conversely, the K(d) value of the 32 degrees C acclimation group (K(d) = 0.88) was significantly higher (P = 0.002) than both the 15 degrees C (K(d) = 0.48) and 22 degrees C (K(d) = 0.46) acclimation groups. In addition, K(d) of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) and B(max) significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of African catfish at all three acclimation temperatures. These results contrast with those reported previously for temperate species, in which B(max) is inversely related to acclimation temperature, and counter a previous suggestion that B(max) is higher in tropical versus temperate species.", 
    "134": "The cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) are widely distributed in mammals, reptiles, amphibians and secernenteas, and are involved in a variety of biological reactions. Here we report the crystal structure of triflin, a snake venom derived blocker of high K(+)-induced artery contraction, at 2.4A resolution. Triflin consists of two domains. The first 163 residues form a large globular body with an alpha-beta-alpha sandwich core, which resembles pathogenesis-related proteins of group-1 (PR-1). Two glutamic acid-associated histidine residues are located in an elongated cleft. A Cd(2+) resides in this binding site, and forms a five-coordination sphere. The subsequent cysteine-rich domain adopts a rod-like shape, which is stabilized by five disulfide bridges. Hydrophobic residues, which may obstruct the target ion-channel, are exposed to the solvent. A concave surface, which is surrounded by these two domains, is also expected to play a significant role in the binding to the target receptor, leading to ion channel blockage. The C-terminal cysteine-rich region has a similar tertiary structure to voltage-gated potassium channel blocker toxins, such as BgK and ShK. These findings will contribute toward understanding the functions of the widely distributed CRISP family proteins.", 
    "135": "Sleep disturbances are commonly observed in mood disorders, and sleep manipulations can influence the clinical status. In the present study, we investigated the possible effect of the 3111 T/C circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) gene polymorphism on insomnia symptomatology during antidepressant treatment. One hundred seventy-eight inpatients were treated with fluvoxamine 300 mg/day (n = 147) or paroxetine 20-40 mg/day (n = 31), and either placebo or pindolol in a double blind design for 6 weeks. The severity of depressive symptoms was weekly assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). We observed a significantly higher presence of insomnia throughout the trial in homozygotes for the C variant (P = 0.026). Other demographic and clinical features were found not to be related with CLOCK polymorphisms. Overall, our findings may suggest that CLOCK genotype influences the time course of insomnia during antidepressant treatment. This, together with previous findings on this polymorphism could lead to a further dissection of the complexity of mood disorders.", 
    "136": "Imaging of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) function in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may support development of strategies, which will improve drug delivery to the brain. [(11)C]verapamil has been developed as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, to image P-gp function in vivo. Ideally, for the purpose of brain imaging, tracers should have a log P between 0.9 and 2.5. The beta-receptor antagonist carvedilol is a P-gp substrate with a log P=2.0, and can be labeled with [(11)C]. The aim of this study was to determine whether the P-gp substrate [(11)C]carvedilol can be used as a PET tracer for visualisation and quantification of the P-gp function in the BBB. Cellular [(11)C]carvedilol accumulation in GLC(4), GLC(4)/P-gp, and GLC(4)/Adr cells increased three-fold in the GLC(4)/P-gp cells after pretreatment with cyclosporin A (CsA) whereas no effect of MK571 could be determined in the GLC(4)/Adr cells. Ex vivo [(11)C]carvedilol biodistribution studies showed that [(11)C]carvedilol uptake in the brain was increased by CsA. [(11)C]carvedilol uptake in other organs was not affected by CsA. Autoradiography studies of rat brains showed that [(11)C]carvedilol was homogeneously distributed over the brain and that pretreatment with CsA increased [(11)C]carvedilol uptake. In vivo PET experiments were performed with and without P-gp modulation by CsA. P-gp mediated transport was quantified by Logan analysis of the PET data, calculating the distribution volume (DV) of [(11)C]carvedilol in the brain. Logan analysis resulted in excellent fits, revealing that [(11)C]carvedilol is not trapped in the brain. Brain DV of [(11)C]carvedilol showed a dose-dependent increase of maximal three-fold after CsA pretreatment. Above 15 mg kg(-1), no change in DV was found. Compared to [(11)C]verapamil less CsA was needed to reach maximal DV, suggesting that [(11)C]carvedilol kinetics is a more sensitive tool to in vivo measure P-gp function.", 
    "137": "Common sensitivity analysis methods for unmeasured confounders provide a corrected point estimate of causal effect for each specified set of unknown parameter values. This article reviews alternative methods for generating deterministic nonparametric bounds on the magnitude of the causal effect using linear programming methods and potential outcomes models. The bounds are generated using only the observed table. We then demonstrate how these bound widths may be reduced through assumptions regarding the potential outcomes under various exposure regimens. We illustrate this linear programming approach using data from the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project. These bounds on causal effect under uncontrolled confounding complement standard sensitivity analyses by providing a range within which the causal effect must lie given the validity of the assumptions.",

Systolic dysfunction was determined from two dimensional echocardiography (left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%) and lung function was assessed by spirometry. All patients were considered for beta blocker initiation and dose up titration.",

Forced expiratory volume in one second (1.1 v 1.5 l, p < 0.01) and forced vital capacity (2.3 v 2.5 l/min, p = 0.2) were not reduced in patients with airways obstruction who received beta blockers. Daily doses of beta blockers at one year did not differ statistically between patients with obstructive and patients with non-obstructive spirometry results. 12 patients discontinued beta blockers and 14 required dose reduction due to side effects.",

Mortality (19% v 6%, p < 0.001) and fatal MI (6.6% v 1.6%, p < 0.001) were increased among male compared with female patients. Diabetes, previous MI, hypertension, and male sex independently predicted CV mortality (p < 0.001). Diabetes greatly increased the risk in a small subgroup of female patients. Male patients had higher mortality than men in the reference population during the first three years (cumulative absolute difference 3.8%) but apparently not thereafter. Female patients had similar mortality to women in the reference population throughout the 9.1 years of observation.",

    "149": "The goal of this study was to determine the baroreflex influence on systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and pulse interval (PI) variability in conscious mice. SAP and PI were measured in C57Bl/6J mice subjected to sinoaortic deafferentation (SAD, n = 21) or sham surgery (n = 20). Average SAP and PI did not differ in SAD or control mice. In contrast, SAP variance was enhanced (21 +/- 4 vs. 9.5 +/- 1 mmHg2) and PI variance reduced (8.8 +/- 2 vs. 26 +/- 6 ms2) in SAD vs. control mice. High-frequency (HF: 1-5 Hz) SAP variability quantified by spectral analysis was greater in SAD (8.5 +/- 2.0 mmHg2) compared with control (2.5 +/- 0.2 mmHg2) mice, whereas low-frequency (LF: 0.1-1 Hz) SAP variability did not differ between the groups. Conversely, LF PI variability was markedly reduced in SAD mice (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 10.8 +/- 3.4 ms2). LF oscillations in SAP and PI were coherent in control mice (coherence = 0.68 +/- 0.05), with changes in SAP leading changes in PI (phase = -1.41 +/- 0.06 radians), but were not coherent in SAD mice (coherence = 0.08 +/- 0.03). Blockade of parasympathetic drive with atropine decreased average PI, PI variance, and LF and HF PI variability in control (n = 10) but had no effect in SAD (n = 6) mice. In control mice, blockade of sympathetic cardiac receptors with propranolol increased average PI and decreased PI variance and LF PI variability (n = 6). In SAD mice, propranolol increased average PI (n = 6). In conclusion, baroreflex modulation of PI contributes to LF, but not HF PI variability, and is mediated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic drives in conscious mice.", 
    "150": "During an investigation of the possible pharmacokinetic interactions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors with metoprolol, we observed that rofecoxib caused a significant reduction in heart rate in young healthy volunteers. The effect of valdecoxib did not reach significance. When these drugs were given together with metoprolol, the effect was continued. The latter effect could not be related to pharmacokinetic interactions. In the light of experimental results claiming a cardioprotective effect of possibly COX-2-derived prostaglandins and clinical observations hinting at an increased risk of sudden cardiovascular death in conjunction with the long-term use of selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, our results may help to increase awareness and to suggest investigation of the impact of coxibs on heart function.", 
    "151": "We compared 2 studies of implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) to determine the effects of device mode on outcomes. The Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators (AVID) trial (1993 to 1997) demonstrated improved survival with the ICD compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. The Dual-chamber And VVI Implantable Defibrillator (DAVID) trial (2000 to 2002) showed that VVI pacing at 40 beats/min in patients with ICDs reduced the combined end point of death and hospitalization for congestive heart failure compared with DDDR pacing at 70 beats/min. Patients in the AVID trial (631 of 1,016) and the DAVID trial (221 of 506) meeting common inclusion and all exclusion criteria were studied. The major end points were the time to death, and the composite end point of time to death or hospitalization for congestive heart failure. Patients in the AVID and DAVID trials were similar, but more AVID patients had coronary artery disease (p = 0.04), history of myocardial infarction (p = 0.005), and previous ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.03). DAVID patients underwent more previous revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass surgery, p = 0.03; percutaneous coronary intervention, p = 0.001), and were more often taking beta-blocking drugs at hospital discharge (p <0.001). The backup VVI ICD groups in both studies had similar outcomes (p = 0.4), even when corrected for the previous demographic differences. The time-to- composite end point was similar in AVID patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs and DAVID patients treated with DDDR ICDs (p = 0.6). Despite improved pharmacologic therapy and revascularization, outcomes have not improved with backup VVI pacing ICDs. If DDDR ICDs had been used in the AVID trial, benefit from ICDs for patients with serious ventricular arrhythmias could have been missed.", 
    "152": "In subsets of patients paroxysmal firing of ectopic foci in pulmonary veins or coronary sinus is an important cause of atrial fibrillation. This appears to represent a rare event overriding a dominant sinus mechanism to alter the rhythmic firing of the atrium. Hence, we tested the hypothesis that a rare stimulation pattern might alter the myocardial substrate, making it more susceptible to the initiation of arrhythmias.", 
    "153": "In isolated right and left rabbit atria, a \"rare\" burst pacing protocol (BPP) was applied as follows: over 3 h, preparations were driven for 4.5 min from sinus node (SN) or Bachmann's bundle (BB) regions at cycle length (CL)=400 ms followed by 30 s of stimulation from coronary sinus (CS) or pulmonary vein (PV) at CL=200 ms. Microelectrodes were used to record action potentials at the end of 4.5 min of pacing at CL=400 ms. We then intervened with 5-min bigeminal pacing to probe atrial vulnerability to arrhythmias: S1 was delivered from SN or BB and S2 from CS or PV, respectively. S1-S2 interval was the shortest eliciting a propagated response.", 
    "154": "BPP shortened repolarization in CS and PV regions but not in SN or BB, resulting in increased dispersion of repolarization in right and decreased in left atria. Propranolol, atropine and losartan failed to alter the decrease in repolarization induced by BPP whereas apamin, nifedipine and ryanodine prevented BPP effects. Before BPP, bigeminy did not induce arrhythmias in either atrium, but after BPP, bigeminy significantly increased the incidence of arrhythmias in the right atrium.", 
    "155": "BPP from foci outside the regions of dominant activation alters dispersion of atrial repolarization. Modulation of apamin-sensitive channels may contribute to the shortening of repolarization in CS and PV regions. Alterations of atrial repolarization gradient create an arrhythmogenic substrate and may be an early step in atrial electrophysiologic remodeling.", 
    "156": "The aim of this randomized, prospective, masked clinical study has been to verify the influence of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ophthalmic solution on intraocular pressure reduction induced by 0.5% timolol and 0.005% latanoprost eyedrops in patients affected by primary open-angle glaucoma. Thirty-two glaucomatous patients, compensated with 0.5% timolol, were randomized into two study groups (A and B). Timolol was continued for the first 2 weeks in all subjects. On the 15th day, in both groups timolol was replaced by latanoprost, and this regimen lasted up to the end of the follow-up (8 weeks). At the beginning of the 2nd week of the study, group A additionally started a 5-week therapy with topical 0.1% diclofenac; during the same period, group B received placebo eyedrops with identical modalities. Intraocular pressure was recorded at 7-day intervals during the first 7 weeks and at the 10th week. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and placebo did not modify the effect of timolol on intraocular pressure. In both groups, latanoprost induced a significant decrease in intraocular pressure. Diclofenac-treated patients exhibited a marked fall in intraocular pressure (p<0.01), whereas in placebo-treated patients, this diminution was less noticeable (p<0.05). After diclofenac withdrawal, in group A intraocular pressure significantly increased (p<0.01), remaining approximately at the same level up to the end of the study. In group B, at the same checks no significant variations in intraocular pressure occurred. In primary open-angle glaucoma patients, diclofenac significantly enhances the hypotensive effect of latanoprost, without influence on timolol efficacy. Because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely employed in medical practice, supplementary ophthalmologic checks should be scheduled during the co-administration of these compounds and prostaglandin analogues.", 
    "157": "We have previously described that propionic (PA) and methylmalonic (MMA) acids increased the in vitro phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins through cAMP-dependent protein kinase and glutamate. In the present study we investigated the in vitro effects of 1 mM glutamate, 2.5 mM MMA and 2.5 mM PA on cAMP levels in the slices of cerebral cortex of young rats. Results showed that PA, MMA and glutamate increased cAMP levels after 30 min of incubation, while the beta-adrenergic agonist epinephrine elicited a similar effect only at a shorter incubation time. Then effects were prevented by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, rather than by glutamate antagonists (AP5, CNQX and MCPG), suggesting that they were mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. In addition, glutamate antagonists per se induced increased cAMP levels; however propranolol prevented only the effect elicited by the metabotropic glutamate antagonist MCPG. Taken together, it is feasible that PA and MMA increase cAMP synthesis via a beta-adrenergic/G protein coupled pathway, in a glutamate-dependent manner. Although additional studies will be necessary to evaluate the importance of these observations for the neuropathology of propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, it is possible that high brain cAMP levels may contribute to a certain extent to the neurological dysfunction of the affected individuals.", 
    "158": "Urotensin II (UII) is a highly conserved peptide that has potent cardiovascular actions following central and systemic administration. To determine whether the cardiovascular actions of UII are mediated via beta-adrenoceptors, we examined the effect of intravenous (IV) propranolol on the responses to intracerebroventricular (ICV) and IV administration of UII in conscious sheep. Sheep were surgically instrumented with ICV guide tubes and flow probes or cardiac sympathetic nerve recording electrodes. ICV UII (0.2 nmol/kg over 1 h) caused prolonged increases in heart rate (HR; 33 +/- 11 beats/min; P < 0.01), dF/dt (581 +/- 83 L/min/s; P < 0.001) and cardiac output (2.3 +/- 0.4 L/min; P < 0.001), accompanied by increases in coronary (19.8 +/- 5.4 mL/min; P < 0.01), mesenteric (211 +/- 50 mL/min; P < 0.05) and iliac (162 +/- 31 mL/min; P < 0.001) blood flows and plasma glucose (7.0 +/- 2.6 mmol/L; P < 0.05). Propranolol (30 mg bolus followed by 0.5 mg/kg/h IV) prevented the cardiac responses to ICV UII and inhibited the mesenteric vasodilatation. At 2 h after ICV UII, when HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were increased, cardiac sympathetic nerve activity (CSNA) was unchanged and the relation between CSNA and diastolic pressure was shifted to the right (P < 0.05). The hyperglycemia following ICV UII was abolished by ganglion blockade but not propranolol. IV UII (20 nmol/kg) caused a transient increase in HR and fall in stroke volume; these effects were not blocked by propranolol. These results demonstrate that the cardiac actions of central UII depend on beta-adrenoreceptor stimulation, secondary to increased CSNA and epinephrine release, whereas the cardiac actions of systemic UII are not mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors and probably depend on a direct action of UII on the heart.", 
    "159": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) induces electrical and ionic remodeling of the atria. We investigated whether AF-induced remodeling alters the electrophysiological and anti-fibrillatory effects of class I (flecainide) and class III (d-sotalol, ibutilide) anti-arrhythmic drugs.", 
    "160": "In 9 goats, the effects of flecainide (6 mg/kg) and d-sotalol (6 mg/kg) on atrial electrophysiology were measured both before and after 48 h of electrically induced AF. During a 1-h infusion period the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and conduction velocity (CV) were measured both during slow and rapid pacing (interval 400 and 200 ms). In 8 other goats, the rate-dependent effects of ibutilide (0.12 mg/kg) on AERP were determined.", 
    "161": "The effects of flecainide on atrial conduction and refractoriness were not altered after 48 h of AF. At a dose of 6 mg/kg flecainide reduced the CV200 by 19+/-5% in normal atria and by 21+/-9% after 48 h of AF (p=0.20). The AERP200 was prolonged by 10+/-6% and 8+/-7%, respectively (p=0.40). In contrast, the effect of d-sotalol on atrial refractoriness was markedly diminished. During control d-sotalol prolonged the AERP400 by 17+/-6% compared to only 6+/-5% after 2 days of AF (p<0.01). Also ibutilide lost much of its class III effect on the AERP by electrical remodeling (from 15 to 5%; p<0.05). The loss of class III action was less pronounced at rapid heart rates.", 
    "162": "AF-induced atrial electrical remodeling in the goat did not modulate the action of flecainide on atrial conduction and refractoriness.
