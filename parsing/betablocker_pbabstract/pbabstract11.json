    "1": "Included were 3962 participants from the first (2001-2003) and second (2010-2011) follow-ups of the population-based Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Disease in Adults. High blood pressure was defined as blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg and the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed hypertension was based on questionnaire information.", 
    "2": "High blood pressure was found in 34.9% of subjects, 49.1% of whom were unaware of this condition; 30.0% had doctor-diagnosed hypertension and, although 82.1% of these received drug treatments, in only 40.8% was blood pressure controlled (<140/90 mm Hg). Substantial first-line beta-blocker use and nonadherence to comorbidity-specific prescription guidelines were observed and remained mostly unexplained. Age-adjusted rates of unawareness and uncontrolled hypertension were more than 20% higher than in the USA.", 
    "3": "There is room for improvement in managing hypertension in Switzerland. Population-based observational studies are essential for identifying and evaluating unmet needs in healthcare; however, to pinpoint the underlying causes it is imperative to facilitate linkage of cohort data to medical records.", 
    "4": "YaAn, a city in Sichuan province, China, was struck by a major earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale on April 20, 2013. This study sought to investigate the impact of YaAn earthquake on the blood pressure (BP) among hospitalized patients in the department of cardiology.", 
    "5": "We enrolled 52 hospitalized patients who were admitted to our hospital at least three days before the day of earthquake in 2013 (disaster group) as compared with 52 patients during April 20, 2014 (nondisaster group). BP was measured three times per day and the prescription of antihypertensive medicine was recorded.", 
    "6": "The earthquake induced a 3.3 mm Hg significant increase in the mean postdisaster systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the disaster group as compared with the nondisaster group. SBP at admission was positively associated with the elevated SBP in the logistic regression model (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.016-1.168, p = 0.015), but not other potential influencing factors, including antihypertensive medicine, sex, age, and body weight, excluding \u03b2-blockers. Patients with \u03b2-blockers prescription at the time of earthquake showed a blunt response to earthquake-induced SBP elevation than those who were taking other antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.128, 95% CI: 0.019-0.876, p = 0.036).", 
    "7": "The YaAn earthquake induced significant increase in SBP even at a distance from the epicenter among hospitalized patients. The findings demonstrate that pure psychological components seem to be a cause of the pressor response and \u03b2-blockers might be better in controlling disaster-induced hypertension.", 
    "8": "The perioperative period is associated with alterations in the neuroendocrine, metabolic, and immune systems, referred to as \"stress response.\" The resultant increased sympathetic activity and elevated serum concentrations of catecholamines may adversely affect the cardiovascular system, resulting in cardiovascular instability (hypertension, tachycardia, and arrhythmia), morbidity (myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke), and mortality (cardiac death and fatal stroke), particularly in patients at an elevated cardiovascular risk and with reduced cardiovascular reserve. Various strategies have been used to ameliorate the adverse perioperative cardiovascular sequelae of the perioperative stress response. Effective pharmacologic blunting of the stress response plays a crucial role in perioperative cardiac risk reduction strategies. In this context, the role of beta-adrenoceptor blockers, alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, and statins has been extensively examined. This chapter evaluates the available evidence with respect to treatment efficacy of these commonly prescribed drugs in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.",

Blood was sampled within a period of 60 h post administration in pre-specified time points. Bisoprolol concentrations were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS method. The products were considered bioequivalent if the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the log-transformed geometric mean ratios (test vs. reference) for AUC(0-t), AUC(0-\u221e), and Cmax were within 80-125% limits.

Both products had similar safety profile and have been well tolerated.", 
    "17": "While beta-blockers are considered contraindicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the prognostic significance of sympathetic nervous system over-activity suggests a potential benefit of beta-blocker therapy. The aim of this randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover, single centre study was to determine the effects of bisoprolol on right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) in idiopathic PAH (iPAH) patients. Additional efficacy and safety parameters were explored.Patients with optimally treated, stable iPAH (New York Heart Association functional class II/III) were randomised to placebo or bisoprolol. Imaging and functional measurements were performed at baseline, crossover and end of study.18 iPAH patients were included, because inclusion faltered before enrolment of the targeted 25 patients. 17 patients completed 6\u2005months of bisoprolol, 15 tolerated bisoprolol, one patient required intravenous diuretics. Bisoprolol was associated with a lower heart rate (17\u2005beats per minute, p=0.0001) but RVEF remained unchanged. A drop in cardiac index (0.5\u2005L\u00b7min(-1)\u00b7m(-2), p=0.015) was observed, along with a trend towards a decreased 6-min walking distance (6MWD).Although careful up-titration of bisoprolol was tolerated by most patients and resulted in a decreased heart rate, no benefit of bisoprolol in iPAH was demonstrated. Decreases in cardiac index and 6MWD suggest a deteriorated cardiac function. The results do not favour the use of bisoprolol in iPAH patients.",

Six months after diagnosis, patients were divided into 3 groups depending on BB dose: no BB (NBB), low dose (<50% of the target dose) (LD), and high dose (\u226550%) (HD). Two different analytical approaches were employed: multivariate Cox model and propensity-score (PS) matching. Outcomes were all-cause death and heart failure (HF) admission. We included 559 patients (134 NBB, 259 LD, and 166 HD) with median follow-up of 29.9months. There were 212 deaths (NBB: 70 (52.2%); LD: 94 (36.3%); and HD: 48 (28.9%)) and 171 HF admissions (NBB: 42 (31.3%); LD: 85 (32.8%); and HD: 44 (26.5%)). On multivariate analysis, both LD and HD were associated with improved survival, with no differences between them (HD vs. NBB=0.67, 95% CI=[0.46-0.98], p=0.037; HD vs. LD=1.03, 95% CI=[0.72-1.46], p=0.894; and LD vs. NBB=0.65, 95% CI=[0.48-0.90], p=0.009).

During follow-up, 35 patients died, with a median time follow-up of 360days amongst survivors (interquartile range, IQR 217-574days). In univariable analysis, moderate-to-severe depression was associated with an increased risk of death (HR: 4.9; 95% CI: 2.3 to 10.2; P<0.001) compared to no depression. Moderate-to-severe depression also predicted all-cause mortality after controlling for age, CCI score, NYHA class IV, NT-proBNP and treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, beta-blocker and diuretics (HR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3 to 7.0; P<0.05).",

Daily injections of NaCl reduced the levels of pregnenolone, progesterone, and corticosterone in the adrenal glands, increased corticosterone excretion with urine, enhanced activity of the first isoform of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the liver and reduction in activity of the second isoform of this enzyme in the kidneys. These changes are typical manifestations of chronic stress. Mifepristone restored pregnenolone content in the adrenal glands and increase in corticosterone concentration in the blood. Under these conditions, activity of the first isoform of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the liver did not change, and a decrease in activity of the second isoform of the enzyme in the kidneys was less pronounced. The results suggest that mifepristone abolished the stress-mediated increase in activity of the first isoform of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the liver and reduced local production of glucocorticoid hormones and their metabolic effects in hepatocytes.",

Here, we investigated the role of \u03b2AR subtypes (\u03b21AR, \u03b22AR, and \u03b23AR) and cAMP in maturation-dependent vasorelaxation impairment. Aortic rings from 15 Sprague-Dawley male rats (3 or 9 weeks old) were harvested and left intact or denuded of the endothelium. Vascular relaxation in aortic rings from younger and older groups was compared in the presence of \u03b2AR subtype agonists and antagonists along with cAMP and cGMP antagonists. Isolated aortic rings were used to evaluate relaxation responses, protein expression was evaluated by western blot or real time PCR, and metabolites were measured by ELISA. Expression of \u03b2AR subtypes and adenylyl cyclase was assessed, and cAMP activity was measured in vascular tissue from both groups. Isoproterenol- and BRL744-dependent relaxation in aortic rings with and without endothelium from 9-week-old rats was impaired compared with younger rats. The \u03b21AR antagonist CGP20712A (10-7 M) did not affect isoproterenol or BRL744-dependent relaxation in arteries from either group. The \u03b22AR antagonist ICI-118,551 (10-7 M) inhibited isoproterenol-dependent aortic relaxation in both groups. The \u03b23AR antagonist SR59230A (10-7 M) inhibited isoproterenol- and BRL744-dependent aortic ring relaxation in younger but not in older rats. All \u03b2AR subtypes were expressed in both groups, although \u03b23AR expression was lower in the older group. Adenylyl cyclase (SQ 22536) or protein kinase A (H89) inhibitors prevented isoproterenol-induced relaxation in younger but not in older rats. Production of cAMP was reduced in the older group. Adenylyl cyclase III and RyR3 protein expression was higher in the younger group. In conclusion, altered expression of \u03b23AR and adenylyl cyclase III may be responsible for reduced cAMP production in the older group.",

It is not efficiently removed in wastewater treatment plants and it has been detected not only in the treated effluents, but also in natural waters. Thus, the knowledge of its fate in the environment is an important issue, and photodegradation is an important degradation pathway. While direct photodegradation of metoprolol by solar light is not relevant, there is evidence in the literature that it suffers indirect photodegradation and a few studies have been published showing the important role of dissolved humic matter as photo-sensitizer. However, the identification of the photoproducts formed in the presence of humic matter is very poor, since only 2 photoproducts had been identified. This study investigated the degradation of metoprolol under simulated solar radiation and in the presence of fulvic acids (FA) extracted from a river. During the photodegradation experiments we observed the formation of new compounds which were separated and tentatively identified by HPLC-UV-ESI-MS(n). At least 16 compounds were tentatively identified, including the 2 compounds previously identified in the literature and 4 new compounds which had not been detected by other authors as degradation products of metoprolol, even when submitted to artificial degradation processes.",

    "67": "Impaired uptake of glutamate builds up the extracellular level of this excitatory transmitter to trigger rhythmic neuronal bursting and delayed cell death in the brainstem motor nucleus hypoglossus. This process is the expression of the excitotoxicity that underlies motoneuron degeneration in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis affecting bulbar motoneurons. In a model of motoneuron excitotoxicity produced by pharmacological block of glutamate uptake in vitro, rhythmic bursting is suppressed by activation of neuronal nicotinic receptors with their conventional agonist nicotine. Emergence of bursting is facilitated by nicotinic receptor antagonists. Following excitotoxicity, nicotinic receptor activity decreases mitochondrial energy dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress and production of toxic radicals. Globally, these phenomena synergize to provide motoneuron protection. Nicotinic receptors may represent a novel target to contrast pathological overactivity of brainstem motoneurons and therefore to prevent their metabolic distress and death.", 
    "68": "Excitotoxicity is thought to be one of the early processes in the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) because high levels of glutamate have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of such patients due to dysfunctional uptake of this transmitter that gradually damages brainstem and spinal motoneurons. To explore potential mechanisms to arrest ALS onset, we used an established in vitro model of rat brainstem slice preparation in which excitotoxicity is induced by the glutamate uptake blocker dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA). Because certain brain neurons may be neuroprotected via activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by nicotine, we investigated if nicotine could arrest excitotoxic damage to highly ALS-vulnerable hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs). On 50% of patch-clamped HMs, TBOA induced intense network bursts that were inhibited by 1-10\u00a0\u03bcm nicotine, whereas nAChR antagonists facilitated burst emergence in non-burster cells. Furthermore, nicotine inhibited excitatory transmission and enhanced synaptic inhibition. Strong neuroprotection by nicotine prevented the HM loss observed after 4\u00a0h of TBOA exposure. This neuroprotective action was due to suppression of downstream effectors of neurotoxicity such as increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species, impaired energy metabolism and upregulated genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, HMs surviving TBOA toxicity often expressed UDP-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, a key element in repair of misfolded proteins: this phenomenon was absent after nicotine application, indicative of ER stress prevention. Our results suggest nAChRs to be potential targets for inhibiting excitotoxic damage of motoneurons at an early stage of the neurodegenerative process.", 
    "69": "Recently a mouse skin carcinogenesis study reported that a \u03b2-blocker carvedilol displayed antitumor-properties via antihyperplastic effects. However, the antihyperplastic mechanism is unclear as the \u03b2-blocker is characterized with multiple pleiotropic effects including stimulation of endothelial NO release and verapamil-like calcium channel blocking activity. To investigate the nature and the origin of the antihyperplastic effects, we tested topical pretreatment with pindolol, heptaminol, ATRA or verapamil against Balb/c mouse ear skin hyperplasia that was induced by TPA. We found that pindolol, heptaminol or ATRA, but not verapamil, inhibited the TPA-induced immunoinflammatory skin changes in an NO-dependent manner, which included epidermal hyperplasia, skin edema and fibrosis. Furthermore, we also observed NO-dependent alleviation of the TPA-induced NK cell depletion in the ear tissues by heptaminol pretreatment. Together our results suggest that stimulation of NO generation from constitutive synthases may be primarily responsible for the reported antihyperplastic and NK cell-preserving effects of the \u03b2-blockers, and that similar effects may be observed in other immunity normalizing compounds that also promote endothelial NO synthesis.", 
    "70": "Metastasis is the leading lethal factor severely restraining the effectiveness of clinical treatment. TGF-beta is the key regulator for metastasis and influences paradoxically on cancer progression. The known TGF-beta blockers exert little selectivity on its functions, indiscriminately causing the anti-metastatic and pro-growth effects. Under such circumstances, specifically rebalancing the oncological function of TGF-beta provides a crucial oncotarget against metastasis. In our study, we established the screening platform targeting cell motility and identified a potential flavonoid, Chamaejasmenin B (ICJ), extracted from Stellera chamaejasme L..It suppressed the migration and invasion in breast cancer cells in vitro. Moreover, by dynamical quantification of breast cancer progression in small-animal imaging system, ICJ was proved to be a potent inhibitor of metastasis with minimal toxic side effects. Mechanism study further revealed that ICJ efficiently blocked TGF-beta induced EMT, disrupted the interaction between \u03b23 integrin-T\u03b2RII complex and, consequently, resulted in the selective inhibition of FAK:Src:p38 pathway. Meanwhile, specific blockage of this pathway largely attenuated the anti-metastatic function of ICJ. Importantly, in contrast with the antagonistic effects on TGF-beta induced metastasis, ICJ obviously sensitized its cytostatic activity, suggesting that it was not a pan-blocker but a rebalancer for the functional output of TGF-beta. Collectively, by targeting TGF-beta Paradox, we experimentally provided a promising candidate for metastatic intervention.", 
    "71": "In the setting of heart failure (HF) pharmacotherapy demonstrates a quantifiable improvement in exercise tolerance also in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). For patients with HFpEF, often older, with higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and other comorbidities, endpoints such as quality of life and functional capacity may be more clinically relevant. However several study show as the use of ACE-I and B-blocker were lesser than expected. Beta-blocker therapy is the keystone of pharmacotherapy of HF patients and exercise training is the essential core of rehabilitation programs, it is important to elucidate the relationship between these therapies. Exercise training improves the clinical status of HF, improving left ventricular ejection fraction and improving quality of life, but it is possible that b-blocker may attenuate exercise training adaptations. Despite this, possible adverse b-blocker effects are just presumed and not confirmed by published randomized clinical trials. Metanalysis suggests that b-blocker compared with placebo enhances improvements in cardiorespiratory performance in exercise training intervention. Despite these evidences, prescription of gold standard therapy and adherence are still suboptimal and should be a priority goal for all CR program.", 
    "72": "The aim of this perforated-patch study was to test the effect of isoproterenol on the membrane potential in mPFC (medial prefrontal cortex) pyramidal neurons. Isoproterenol depolarized the membrane potential recorded from the soma. This effect was absent in the presence of metoprolol, suggesting the involvement of beta1-adrenergic receptors. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin also depolarized the membrane potential. Moreover, the effect of isoproterenol was abolished by the adenylate cyclase inhibitor SQ 22536. This suggested that adenylate cyclase was involved in mediating the effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. The isoproterenol-induced depolarization persisted after inhibition of protein kinase A with H-89. The effect of beta-adrenergic receptor activation on the membrane potential was dependent on Ih channels because it was abolished in the presence of the Ih channel inhibitor ZD 7288. Dendritic recordings were also performed. In the dendritic segments between 100 microm and 150 microm from the soma and between 200 microm and 250 microm from the soma, isoproterenol also depolarized the membrane potential. The magnitude of the beta-adrenergic receptor-stimulated depolarization was the same in the soma and in both dendritic localizations. The depolarization exerted by isoproterenol may influence PFC cognitive functions.", 
    "73": "\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists are commonly used in ischaemic heart disease (IHD) patients, yet may impair signalling and efficacy of 'cardioprotective' interventions. We assessed effects of chronic \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonism on myocardial resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury and the ability of cardioprotective interventions [classic ischaemic preconditioning (IPC); novel sustained ligand-activated preconditioning (SLP)] to reduce IR injury in murine hearts. Young male C57Bl/6 mice were untreated or received atenolol (0.5g/l in drinking water) for 4 weeks. Subsequently, two cardioprotective stimuli were evaluated: morphine pellets implanted (to induce SLP, controls received placebo) 5 days prior to Langendorff heart perfusion, and IPC in perfused hearts (3\u00d71.5min ischaemia/2min reperfusion). Atenolol significantly reduced in vivo heart rate. Untreated control hearts exhibited substantial left ventricular dysfunction (~50% pressure development recovery, ~20mmHg diastolic pressure rise) with significant release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, tissue injury indicator) after 25min ischaemia/45min reperfusion. Contractile dysfunction and elevated LDH were reduced >50% with IPC and SLP. While atenolol treatment did not modify baseline contractile function, post-ischaemic function was significantly depressed compared to untreated hearts. Atenolol pre-treatment abolished beneficial effects of IPC, whereas SLP protection was preserved. These data indicate that chronic \u03b21-adrenoceptor blockade can exert negative effects on functional IR tolerance and negate conventional IPC (implicating \u03b21-adrenoceptors in IR injury and IPC signalling). However, novel morphine-induced SLP is resistant to inhibition by \u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonism.", 
    "74": "Multigenerational bioaccumulation and biotransformation activity and short-term kinetics (e.g., uptake and depuration) of propranolol in Daphnia magna were investigated at environmental concentration. The body burden and the major metabolite, desisopropyl propranolol (DIP), of propranolol were quantified using LC-MS/MS at the end of each generation after exposure for 11 generations. The accumulation of propranolol in D.\u00a0magna at an environmental concentration of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L was not much different between the parent (F0) and the eleventh filial (F10) generation. However, at 28\u00a0\u03bcg/L, its accumulation was 1.6 times higher-up to 18.9 \u03bcg/g-in the F10 generation relative to the F0. In contrast to propranolol, DIP intensity gradually increased from F0 to F10 at 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L, reflecting an increase in detoxification load and biotransformation performance; no increasing trend was observed at 28\u00a0\u03bcg/L. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) showed higher values with a lower concentration and longer period of exposure. The average values of the BAF for 21 days of long-term exposure in successive 11 generations were 440.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0119.7 and 1026.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0208.6\u00a0L/kg for 28\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively. These are comparable to the BAF of 192 for the short-term 72-h exposure at 28\u00a0\u03bcg/L in the parent generation. It is also recommended that future studies for pharmaceutical ingredients be conducted on drug-drug interaction and structural characteristics on the prediction of biotransformation activity and bioaccumulation rate.",

This bradycardic effect was achieved within 1 to 3min. The decrease in systolic blood pressure (baseline: 107mmHg, minimum values were around 99mmHg) was significant but not dose dependent, and occurred within 3 to 12min.

L-Arginine/PE combination was not able to decrease tension when alpha adrenoceptors were blocked with Phentolamine or endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was blocked with N\u03c9-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). Propranolol, a beta blocker, was unable to prevent the reduction in tension by the L-Arginine/PE combination. Adrenaline and noradrenaline (and not isoproterenol) also reduced vessel tension in the presence of L-Arginine. Even when NO levels were not enhanced, relieving NO from having to stimulate the enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) (either by using sGC blockers, namely ODQ or methylene blue, or by enhancing cGMP levels (with sildenafil) which by negative feedback probably inhibits sGC) led to PE-induced reduction of vascular tension. PMA-phorbol myristate acetate-an agonist which stimulates Protein Kinase C was able to prevent the ability of PE to reduce vascular tension in a high NO environment. Our conclusion is that PE reduces vascular tension through alpha adrenoceptors if there is excess NO availability to activate a putative pathway. Though the reduction of vessel tone by PE is dependent on NO, it is independent of cGMP. Prior treatment with PMA or PE itself can prevent further PE-induced reduction of tension in a high NO environment. The results here suggest, counter-intuitively, that alpha blockers may be of help in the treatment of septic shock where nitric oxide levels are high.",

    "108": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) remain the primary conduit by which cells detect environmental stimuli and communicate with each other. Upon activation by extracellular agonists, these seven-transmembrane-domain-containing receptors interact with heterotrimeric G proteins to regulate downstream second messenger and/or protein kinase cascades. Crystallographic evidence from a prototypic GPCR, the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR), in complex with its cognate G protein, Gs, has provided a model for how agonist binding promotes conformational changes that propagate through the GPCR and into the nucleotide-binding pocket of the G protein \u03b1-subunit to catalyse GDP release, the key step required for GTP binding and activation of G proteins. The structure also offers hints about how G-protein binding may, in turn, allosterically influence ligand binding. Here we provide functional evidence that G-protein coupling to the \u03b22AR stabilizes a \u2018closed\u2019 receptor conformation characterized by restricted access to and egress from the hormone-binding site. Surprisingly, the effects of G protein on the hormone-binding site can be observed in the absence of a bound agonist, where G-protein coupling driven by basal receptor activity impedes the association of agonists, partial agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists. The ability of bound ligands to dissociate from the receptor is also hindered, providing a structural explanation for the G-protein-mediated enhancement of agonist affinity, which has been observed for many GPCR\u2013G-protein pairs. Our data also indicate that, in contrast to agonist binding alone, coupling of a G protein in the absence of an agonist stabilizes large structural changes in a GPCR. The effects of nucleotide-free G protein on ligand-binding kinetics are shared by other members of the superfamily of GPCRs, suggesting that a common mechanism may underlie G-protein-mediated enhancement of agonist affinity.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the enzymatic activity of the variants toward the CYP2D6 substrate carvedilol in vitro. The CYP2D6 proteins, including CYP2D6.1 (wild type), CYP2D6.2, CYP2D6.10, and 22 other novel CYP2D6 variants, were expressed from insect microsomes and incubated with carvedilol ranging from 1.0 \u03bcM to 50 \u03bcM at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. After termination, the carvedilol metabolites were extracted and detected using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. Among the 24 CYP2D6 variants, CYP2D6.92 and CYP2D6.96 were catalytically inactive and the remaining 22 variants exhibited significantly decreased intrinsic clearance values (ranging from ~25% to 95%) compared with CYP2D6.1. The present data in vitro suggest that the newly found variants significantly reduced catalytic activities compared with CYP2D6.1. Given that CYP2D6 protein activities could affect carvedilol plasma levels, these findings are greatly relevant to personalized medicine.",

    "123": "\u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs) are critical regulators of acute cardiovascular physiology. In response to elevated catecholamine stimulation during development of congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic activation of Gs-dependent \u03b21AR and Gi-dependent \u03b22AR pathways leads to enhanced cardiomyocyte death, reduced \u03b21AR expression, and decreased inotropic reserve. \u03b2-blockers act to block excessive catecholamine stimulation of \u03b2ARs to decrease cellular apoptotic signaling and normalize \u03b21AR expression and inotropy. Whereas these actions reduce cardiac remodeling and mortality outcomes, the effects are not sustained. Converse to G-protein-dependent signaling, \u03b2-arrestin-dependent signaling promotes cardiomyocyte survival. Given that \u03b22AR expression is unaltered in CHF, a \u03b2-arrestin-biased agonist that operates through the \u03b22AR represents a potentially useful therapeutic approach. Carvedilol, a currently prescribed nonselective \u03b2-blocker, has been classified as a \u03b2-arrestin-biased agonist that can inhibit basal signaling from \u03b2ARs and also stimulate cell survival signaling pathways. To understand the relative contribution of \u03b2-arrestin bias to the efficacy of select \u03b2-blockers, a specific \u03b2-arrestin-biased pepducin for the \u03b22AR, intracellular loop (ICL)1-9, was used to decouple \u03b2-arrestin-biased signaling from occupation of the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket. With similar efficacy to carvedilol, ICL1-9 was able to promote \u03b22AR phosphorylation, \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, \u03b22AR internalization, and \u03b2-arrestin-biased signaling. Interestingly, ICL1-9 was also able to induce \u03b22AR- and \u03b2-arrestin-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent contractility in primary adult murine cardiomyocytes, whereas carvedilol had no efficacy. Thus, ICL1-9 is an effective tool to access a pharmacological profile stimulating cardioprotective signaling and inotropic effects through the \u03b22AR and serves as a model for the next generation of cardiovascular drug development.",

However, it is still unclear whether (D-Ser2)Oxm can directly protect cultured neurons against A\u03b21-42-induced cytotoxicity. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of (D-Ser2)Oxm on the cultured primary hippocampal neurons by testing the cell viability, neuronal apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular calcium concentration. The results showed that treatment with (D-Ser2)Oxm effectively reversed A\u03b21-42-induced decline in cell viability (P < 0.001), and this protective effect could be inhibited by the pretreatment with exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 receptor blocker. (D-Ser2)Oxm treatment also decreased A\u03b21-42-induced neuronal early apoptosis and down-regulated apoptotic protein caspase3. Meantime, (D-Ser2)Oxm treatment inhibited A\u03b21-42-induced [Ca(2+)]i elevation, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, and glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) activation. These results suggest that (D-Ser2)Oxm can protect hippocampal neurons against A\u03b21-42-induced cytotoxicity and this effect may be related to activation of GLP-1 receptors, regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis and stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential.",

    "140": "The cardiac pacemaker sets the heart's primary rate, with pacemaker discharge controlled by the autonomic nervous system through intracardiac ganglia. A fundamental issue in understanding the relationship between neural activity and cardiac chronotropy is the identification of neuronal populations that control pacemaker cells. To date, most studies of neurocardiac control have been done in mammalian species, where neurons are embedded in and distributed throughout the heart, so they are largely inaccessible for whole-organ, integrative studies. Here, we establish the isolated, innervated zebrafish heart as a novel alternative model for studies of autonomic control of heart rate. Stimulation of individual cardiac vagosympathetic nerve trunks evoked bradycardia (parasympathetic activation) and tachycardia (sympathetic activation). Simultaneous stimulation of both vagosympathetic nerve trunks evoked a summative effect. Effects of nerve stimulation were mimicked by direct application of cholinergic and adrenergic agents. Optical mapping of electrical activity confirmed the sinoatrial region as the site of origin of normal pacemaker activity and identified a secondary pacemaker in the atrioventricular region. Strong vagosympathetic nerve stimulation resulted in a shift in the origin of initial excitation from the sinoatrial pacemaker to the atrioventricular pacemaker. Putative pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular regions expressed adrenergic \u03b22 and cholinergic muscarinic type 2 receptors. Collectively, we have demonstrated that the zebrafish heart contains the accepted hallmarks of vertebrate cardiac control, establishing this preparation as a viable model for studies of integrative physiological control of cardiac function by intracardiac neurons.",

After an acute coronary syndrome there are short- and long-term risks of subsequent cardiovascular events. This leads to opportunities to initiate strategies to reduce complications resulting from myocardial injury (cardiac protection) and to prevent recurrent acute coronary events (vascular protection). The results from clinical trials inform best practice and guidelines for patient management. Despite clear and consistent guidelines, an important number of patients are not receiving these treatments. Moreover, many others do not receive treatment that follows the strategy proven in the clinical trial and this is associated with a significant loss of opportunities to improve outcomes. The Canadian Heart Research Centre has therefore assembled a panel of experts to provide a review of available data and distill it to specific evidence-based recommendations that can be used by specialists and primary care physicians as a platform for secondary prevention. The therapeutic recommendations are conveniently divided into vascular protection (dual antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering, and renin angiotensin system inhibition) which should be considered in all patients; cardiac protection (addition of \u03b2-blocker therapy) in patients with left ventricular dysfunction including consideration for management of heart failure; and continuing management of risk factors and comorbid conditions on the basis of the specific patient profile.

The enantioselectivies of the as-obtained novel CSP were evaluated using 21 model racemates including flavonoids, aromatic alcohols, acidic drugs, \u03b2-blocker and amino acids. Good enantioseparations were achieved in polar-organic phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with the highest resolution of 8.07 observed for 7-methoxyflavanone. The enantioseparations in normal-phase HPLC were fine-tuned with the polarity of the mobile phase with different alcohols as organic modifiers. Improved chiral resolutions of analytes but longer retention were observed in mobile phases with decreased polarity. On comparison with previously reported clicked CD CSP, the cationic CD clicked CSP exhibited better enenatioseparations for selected racemates even in normal-phase HPLC. The results indicate that 3-methoxypropylammonium and phenylcarbamoylated moieties of the cationic CSP may provide intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding, \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation and dipole-dipole besides inclusion complexation to drive the enantioseparation.",

Bacterial viability measurements reveal that the efflux pump TtgABC plays a more important role than the TtgGHI pump in strain tolerance to propranolol. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy was then used as a rapid, high-throughput screening tool to investigate any phenotypic changes resulting from exposure to varying levels of propranolol. Multivariate statistical analysis of these MIR data revealed gradient trends in resultant ordination scores plots, which were related to the concentration of propranolol. MIR illustrated phenotypic changes associated with the presence of this drug within the cell that could be assigned to significant changes that occurred within the bacterial protein components. To complement this phenotypic fingerprinting approach metabolic profiling was performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify metabolites of interest during the growth of bacteria following toxic perturbation with the same concentration levels of propranolol. Metabolic profiling revealed that ornithine, which was only produced by P. putida cells in the presence of propranolol, presents itself as a major metabolic feature that has important functions in propranolol stress tolerance mechanisms within this highly significant and environmentally relevant species of bacteria.",

    "161": "Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) provide noninvasive measures of the relative activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which promotes self-maintenance and restoration, and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which prepares an animal for danger. The PNS decreases HR, whereas the SNS increases HR. The PNS and SNS also contribute to oscillations in heartbeat intervals at different frequencies, producing HRV. HRV promotes resilience and adjustment capacity in the organism to intrinsic and extrinsic changes. Measuring HRV can reveal the condition and emotional state of animals, including aspects of their stress physiology. Until now, the functioning of the PNS and SNS and their relationship with other physiological systems have been studied almost exclusively in humans. In this study, we tested their influence on HR and HRV for the first time in a wild-caught seabird, the streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas). We analyzed electrocardiograms collected from birds carrying externally attached HR loggers and that received injections that pharmacologically blocked the PNS, the SNS, or both, as well as those that received a saline (sham) injection or no injection (control). The PNS strongly dominated modulation of HR and also HRV across all frequencies, whereas the SNS contributed only slightly to low-frequency oscillations. The saline injection itself acted as a stressor, causing a dramatic drop in PNS activity in HRV and an increase in HR, though PNS activity continued to dominate even during acute stress. Dominant PNS activity is expected for long-lived species, which should employ physiological strategies that minimize somatic deterioration coming from stress.",

The prevalence and socioeconomic burden of hypertension in the Asia-Pacific region are predicted to increase in the coming decades. Effective blood pressure lowering reduces overall cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients, yet doubt has been raised regarding the use of (mainly older generation) \u03b2-blockers as initial therapy in hypertension. Consequently, several international treatment guidelines do not recommend \u03b2-blockers for the treatment of hypertension. However, in contrast to first-generation and second-generation \u03b2-blockers, the third-generation, vasodilating \u03b2-blocker nebivolol has a considerably better metabolic, haemodynamic and side effect profile. In addition to providing effective blood pressure control similar to other \u03b2-blockers and drugs from other antihypertensive classes, nebivolol exerts a dual mechanism for increasing the bioavailability of the naturally occurring vasodilator nitric oxide. The clinical benefits and significance of enhancing nitric oxide levels in hypertensive patients have been shown in direct comparisons of nebivolol with other \u03b2-blockers. While \u03b2-blockers generally provide comparable blood pressure reductions, only nebivolol demonstrated enhanced vasodilation and blood flow by increasing the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and therefore increasing nitric oxide release from the endothelium. In contrast to other \u03b2-blockers, therefore, it has been suggested that nebivolol has beneficial effects in several hypertensive subgroups due to its vasodilating properties. Considering the existing data, it may be timely for treatment guidelines to recommend third-generation vasodilating \u03b2-blockers as a first-line option for the pharmacotherapy of hypertension.",

However, no crystal structures and very little research exists for OARs. Furthermore, GPCRs are large proteins, are suspended in a lipid bilayer, and are activated on the millisecond timescale, all of which make conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations infeasible, even if run on large supercomputers. However, accelerated Molecular Dynamics (aMD) simulations can reduce this timescale to even hundreds of nanoseconds, while running the simulations on graphics processing units (GPUs) would enable even small clusters of GPUs to have processing power equivalent to hundreds of CPUs. Our results show that aMD simulations run on GPUs can successfully obtain the active and inactive state conformations of a GPCR on this reduced timescale. Furthermore, we discovered a potential alternate active-state agonist-binding position in the octopamine receptor which has yet to be observed and may be a novel GPCR agonist-binding position.

Moreover, our results indicate that phentolamine inhibits the proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis of HDMECs and HBMECs. Finally, VEGFR-2 and Ang1/2 expression of HDMECs was suppressed by phentolamine. Together, these results indicate that phentolamine impairs several critical events of neovascularization, and \u03b1-ARs, as well as the VEGF/VEGFR-2 and Ang/Tie-2 signaling pathways, may be involved in these processes.

It can be used to support formulation optimization, predict in vivo drug exposure across a potential patient population, select a biologically relevant in vitro dissolution test condition, and support the use of in vitro dissolution data as a surrogate for in vivo bioequivalence trials. The pharmacological and statistical implications of this correlation are linked to the method by which the IVIVC was determined and to the assumptions and optimization approaches integrated into the estimation procedure. Using previously published data generated in normal healthy volunteers, an IVIVC for metoprolol was established using a mechanistic modeling approach. Within that framework, we explored the consequences of (1) our method of fitting a single Weibull function to the in vivo dissolution, (2) our selection of weighting scheme and optimization approaches, (3) the impact of applying a fixed versus fitted gastric emptying time, and 4) the importance of factoring population variability into our IVIVC estimation and profile reconvolution. We identified those factors found to be critical in terms of their influence on the accuracy of our predicted systemic metoprolol concentration-time profiles.

In ulcerated IHs, complete healing of the ulcerations occurred in an average treatment time of 5.5 weeks. Atenolol treatment promoted dramatic decreases in HAS scores after week 1. An \"excellent\" treatment response (compete or nearly complete resolution of the IH) was observed in 56.5% of patients at week 24. No significant hypoglycemia, bronchospasm, bradycardia, or hypotension occurred. The most common adverse event was diarrhea, followed by agitation and sleep disturbance.This study demonstrated that atenolol was effective and safe at a dose of 1\u200amg/kg per day for 24 weeks in the treatment of proliferating IHs.",

Using a TMA with patient samples we found high Smad2 phosphorylation in ovarian cancer tumoral cells, independently of tumor subtype (high-grade serous or endometrioid). To evaluate the impact of TGF\u03b2 receptor inhibition on tumoral growth, we used different models of human ovarian cancer orthotopically grown in nude mice (OVAs). Treatment with a TGF\u03b2RI&II dual inhibitor, LY2109761, caused a significant reduction in tumor size in all these models, affecting cell proliferation rate. We identified Insulin Growth Factor (IGF)1 receptor as the signal positively regulated by TGF\u03b2 implicated in ovarian tumor cell proliferation. Inhibition of IGF1R activity by treatment with a blocker antibody (IMC-A12) or with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (linsitinib) inhibited ovarian tumoral growth in vivo. When IGF1R levels were decreased by shRNA treatment, LY2109761 lost its capacity to block tumoral ovarian cell proliferation. At the molecular level TGF\u03b2 induced mRNA IGF1R levels. Overall, our results suggest an important role for the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway in ovarian tumor cell growth through the control of IGF1R signaling pathway.

The patient population had advanced chronic heart failure with QRS interval prolongation\u00a0\u2265120 ms and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction). COMPANION had a composite hospitalization and mortality endpoint as the primary outcome measure but was also powered for mortality as the first secondary endpoint. The conduct of COMPANION was challenged by important issues that arose during the trial, the most important of which was U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of CRT devices. Along with other challenges, this issue was appropriately dealt with by the Steering Committee and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee and did not negatively affect trial results or conclusions. The authors report here updated analyses from the study, which are consistent with previously published results indicating that CRT-P or CRT-D has favorable effects on heart failure morbidity and mortality in a patient population \"precision\" selected by the surrogate marker of increased QRS interval duration. New analyses indicate that increasing the number of classes of neurohormonal inhibitor concurrent therapy has a positive effect on CRT mortality reduction.

    "231": "The nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (\u03b2-blocker) carvedilol has been shown to protect against myocardial injury, but the detailed underlying mechanisms are unclear. We recently reported that carvedilol stimulates the processing of microRNA (miR)-199a-3p and miR-214 in the heart via \u03b2-arrestin1-biased \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (\u03b21AR) cardioprotective signaling. Here, we investigate whether these \u03b2-arrestin1/\u03b21AR-responsive miRs mediate the beneficial effects of carvedilol against simulated ischemia/reperfusion (sI/R). Using cultured cardiomyocyte cell lines and primary cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate that carvedilol upregulates miR-199a-3p and miR-214 in both ventricular and atrial cardiomyocytes subjected to sI/R. Overexpression of the two miRs in cardiomyocytes mimics the effects of carvedilol to activate p-AKT survival signaling and the expression of a downstream pluripotency marker Sox2 in response to sI/R. Moreover, carvedilol-mediated p-AKT activation is abolished by knockdown of either miR-199a-3p or miR-214. Along with previous studies to directly link the cardioprotective actions of carvedilol to upregulation of p-AKT/stem cell markers, our findings suggest that the protective roles of carvedilol during ischemic injury are in part attributed to activation of these two protective miRs. Loss of function of miR-199a-3p and miR-214 also increases cardiomyocyte apoptosis after sI/R. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-199a-3p and miR-214 repress the predictive or known apoptotic target genes ddit4 and ing4, respectively, in cardiomyocytes. These findings suggest pivotal roles for miR-199a-3p and miR-214 as regulators of cardiomyocyte survival and contributors to the functional benefits of carvedilol therapy.",

    "241": "This work demonstrates how nonlinearity in Raman spectrometry of pharmaceuticals can be handled and accurate quantification can be achieved by applying certain chemometric methods including variable selection. Such approach proved to be successful even if the component spectra are very similar or spectral intensities of the constituents are strongly different. The relevant examples are: blends of two crystalline forms of carvedilol (\"CRYST-PM\" blend) and a three-component pharmaceutical model system (\"PHARM-TM\" blend). The widely used classical least squares regression (CLS) and partial least squares regression (PLS) quantification methods provided relatively poor root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) values: approximately 2-4% and 4-10% for CRYST-PM and PHARM-TM respectively. The residual plots of these models indicated the nonlinearity of the preprocessed data sets. More accurate quantitative results could be achieved with properly applied variable selection methods. It was observed that variable selection methods discarded the most intensive bands while less intensive ones were retained as the most informative spectral ranges. As a result not only the accuracy of concentration determination was enhanced, but the linearity of models was improved as well. This indicated that nonlinearity occurred especially at the intensive spectral bands. Other methods developed for handling nonlinearity were also capable of adapting to the spectral nature of both data sets. The RMSEP could be decreased this way to 1% in CRYST-PM and 3-6% in PHARM-TM.
