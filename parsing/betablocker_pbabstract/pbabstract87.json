The visual aspect, weight variation, friability, drug content and dissolving time were analyzed. Out of seven lots, five presented quality deviation. Irregularities were found in the visual aspect, weight variation, friability and active ingredient. The evaluation of the quality of medication, besides ensuring the quality of the products supplied by the health system and safe usage by patients, is also a tool to evaluate medical supply companies and ensure the enhancement of the bidding process. The implementation of a management system that includes the evaluation of medical supply companies, improvement of the bidding process with clear specifications about the quality of the medicines bought are all recommended to ensure product safety.",

    "44": "Pathophysiological process of ethanol physical dependence and its withdrawal syndrome is supposed to result from adaptive changes in a number of neurotransmission systems, and several reports have demonstrated functional relationship between behavioral responses and neurotransmission systems in ethanol-dependent and -withdrawn animals. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral responses observed in these animals are still controversial at present. Alterations of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) function in the brains of mice physically dependent on ethanol were examined because of few available data on functional changes of beta-ARs and its significance in ethanol withdrawal signs. The protein level of beta-ARs also significantly increased in the frontal cortex of mouse with ethanol physical dependence and conditions withdrawn from ethanol after chronic treatment with ethanol vapor for 9 days. Intracerebroventricular administration of nadolol, a non-selective antagonist for beta-ARs, immediately after discontinuation of ethanol inhalation clearly attenuated the expression of withdrawal signs. These findings suggests that ethanol physical dependence induces beta-AR up-regulation, that is their increased number and facilitation of beta-AR signaling, which may at least in part participates in expression of tonic-clonic convulsion as one of ethanol withdrawal signs. We further investigated relationship between actin of cytoskeleton and relapse of alcohol dependence after withdrawal from alcohol vapor inhalation for 9 days. After 3 days of withdrawal from alcohol vapor alcohol-induced place preference was enhanced, which was blocked by the treatment with an actin polymerization inhibitor, cytochalasin D, and anactin depolymerization inhibitor, phalloidin, during 3 days after ethanol withdrawal. These findings suggest that changes in actin turnover on withdrawal from alcohol vapor involve in sensitization of alcohol-induced place preference.", 
    "45": "This study examined the effects of the arousal level of the rat and exposure to a behavioral stressor on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of a non-aversive hippocampal-dependent learning paradigm, the object location task. Learning was tested under two arousal conditions: no previous habituation to the experimental context (high novelty stress/arousal level) or extensive prior habituation (reduced novelty stress/arousal level). Results indicated that in the habituated rats, exposure to an out-of-context stressor (i.e, elevated platform stress) impaired consolidation and retrieval, but not acquisition, of the task. Non-habituated animals under both stressed and control conditions did not show retention of the task. In habituated rats, RU-486 (10 ng/side), a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, or propranolol (0.75 \u00b5g/side), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, injected into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), prevented the impairing effects of the stressor on consolidation, but not on retrieval. The CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN, 5 \u00b5g/side) microinjected into the BLA did not prevent the effects of stress on either consolidation or retrieval. Taken together the results suggest that: (i) GR and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors in the BLA mediate the impairing effects of stress on the consolidation, but not the retrieval, of a neutral, non-aversive hippocampal-dependent task, (ii) the impairing effects of stress on hippocampal consolidation and retrieval are mediated by different neural mechanisms (i.e., different neurotransmitters or different brain areas), and (iii) the effects of stress on memory depend on the interaction between several main factors such as the stage of memory processing under investigation, the animal's level of arousal and the nature of the task (neutral or aversive).", 
    "46": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death; 80-85% of lung cancer cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Smoking is a documented risk factor for the development of this cancer. Although nicotine does not have the ability to initiate carcinogenic events, recent studies have implicated nicotine in growth stimulation of NSCLC. Using three NSCLC cell lines (NCI-H322, NCI-H441 and NCI-H1299), we identified the cooperation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs) as principal regulators of these effects. Proliferation was measured by thymidine incorporation and MTT assays, and Western blots were used to monitor the upregulation of the nAChRs and activation of signaling molecules. Noradrenaline and GABA were measured by immunoassays. Nicotine-treated NSCLC cells showed significant induction of the \u03b17nAChR and \u03b14nAChR, along with significant inductions of p-CREB and p-ERK1/2 accompanied by increases in the stress neurotransmitter noradrenaline, which in turn led to the observed increase in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Effects on cell proliferation and signaling proteins were reversed by the \u03b17nAChR antagonist \u03b1-BTX or the \u03b2-blocker propranolol. Nicotine treatment also down-regulated expression of the GABA synthesizing enzyme GAD 65 and the level of endogenous GABA, while treatment of NSCLC cells with GABA inhibited cell proliferation. Interestingly, GABA acts by reducing \u03b2-adrenergic activated cAMP signaling. Our findings suggest that nicotine-induced activation of this autocrine noradrenaline-initiated signaling cascade and concomitant deficiency in inhibitory GABA, similar to modulation of these neurotransmitters in the nicotine-addicted brain, may contribute to the development of NSCLC in smokers. Our data suggest that exposure to nicotine either by tobacco smoke or nicotine supplements facilitates growth and progression of NSCLC and that pharmacological intervention by \u03b2 blocker may lower the risk for NSCLC development among smokers and could be used to enhance the clinical outcome of standard cancer therapy.", 
    "47": "Recent years have witnessed new innovation in Bayesian techniques to adjust for unmeasured confounding. A challenge with existing methods is that the user is often required to elicit prior distributions for high-dimensional parameters that model competing bias scenarios. This can render the methods unwieldy. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to adjust for unmeasured confounding that derives default priors for bias parameters for observational studies with binary covariates. The confounding effects of measured and unmeasured variables are treated as exchangeable within a Bayesian framework. We model the joint distribution of covariates by using a log-linear model with pairwise interaction terms. Hierarchical priors constrain the magnitude and direction of bias parameters. An appealing property of the method is that the conditional distribution of the unmeasured confounder follows a logistic model, giving a simple equivalence with previously proposed methods. We apply the method in a data example from pharmacoepidemiology and explore the impact of different priors for bias parameters on the analysis results.",

There is clinical evidence that telmisartan is more effective than losartan in reducing proteinuria in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy, because it is a partial agonist of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), as well as an Ang II type 1 receptor blocker (AMADEO Study [A comparison of telMisartan versus losArtan in hypertensive type 2 DiabEtic patients with Overt nephropathy]). In this study, we examined the role of PPAR\u03b3 activation in the renal protective actions of telmisartan using Ang II type 1 receptor-deficient mice. Renal injury was induced in Ang II type 1 receptor-deficient mice by producing unilateral ureteral obstruction, which exhibited severe renal interstitial fibrosis and inflammation. In these mice, telmisartan prevented hydronephrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction more strongly than did losartan. Importantly, the prevention of renal atrophy and fibrosis by telmisartan was significantly attenuated by GW9662, a PPAR\u03b3 antagonist. Interestingly, the downstream effector of PPAR\u03b3 activation by telmisartan is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a well-known antifibrotic factor, because renal HGF expression was significantly increased by telmisartan, and a neutralizing antibody against HGF diminished the renal protective action of telmisartan. These beneficial changes by telmisartan were associated with a decrease in the expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and other proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokine genes through PPAR\u03b3/HGF activation. Our findings provide evidence of organ protective actions of telmisartan through the PPAR\u03b3/HGF pathway, independent of Ang II type 1 receptor blockade. Further development of the next generation of Ang II type 1 receptor blockers with added organ protective actions, such as PPAR\u03b3 activation, might provide new beneficial drugs to treat renal and cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "54": "The investigation of chiral interactions of drugs with plasma proteins is of fundamental importance for drug efficacy and toxicity studies. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple liquid-liquid interface procedure for investigating chiral interactions. Chiral discrimination of the enantiomers of a basic drug, propranolol, was achieved at a micro liquid-liquid interface, using \u03b1(1)-acid-glycoprotein (AGP) as a chiral acute phase plasma protein. When the protein is added to an aqueous phase containing the enantiomers of propranalol hydrochloride, the binding of (S)- and (R)-propranolol hydrochloride to the protein results in a decrease in the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) current responses corresponding to the decrease in transfer of propranolol at an aqueous-1,2-dichloroethane interface. This decrease is a consequence of the complexation of the drug and the protein. The complex drug-protein does not transfer across the interface nor changes the transfer potential of the uncomplexed form of propranolol enantiomers. The bound concentration of propranolol enantiomers in the presence of AGP was found to be greater for (S)-propranolol than (R)-propranolol for solutions containing constant concentrations of AGP (50 \u03bcM).

After adjusting for risk characteristics, failure to continue \u03b2-blocker treatment was associated with a nearly 2-fold risk of 90-day combined adverse event (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.19-3.26). The odds were even greater among patients with higher cardiac risk (odds ratio, 5.91; 95% CI, 1.40- 25.00). The odds of combined adverse events continued to be elevated 1 year postoperatively (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.08-2.55).",

In a multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for maternal age, weight, parity, previous PIH, and baseline hemoglobin, resting heart rate, and BP levels, antihypertensive therapy was associated with a lower incidence of adverse maternal events (P = 0.011). Compared to the control group, the treatment group had lower incidence of SGA babies (40% vs. 23%, P = 0.033), preterm birth (36% vs. 14%, P = 0.002), and admission to neonatal unit (30% vs. 15%, P = 0.036). After adjustment for maternal age, weight, baseline hemoglobin, resting heart rate, BP level, parity and previous history of PIH, fetal death, preterm delivery or SGA baby, antihypertensive therapy was associated with a lower incidence of adverse perinatal events (P = 0.016). Maternal and perinatal mortality rates were not significantly different between treatment and control groups. In conclusion, pharmacological treatment of mild to moderate PIH is associated with lower rate of some maternal and fetal-neonatal non-fatal adverse events compared to no routine use of antihypertensive therapy.",

The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study has effectively demonstrated that patients with ocular hypertension should be risk stratified prior to initiation of treatment and that it appears to be relatively safe to delay treatment in low-risk patients. The 3-year canaloplasty study demonstrates the long-term safety and efficacy of this surgery. However, it also demonstrates that canaloplasty can deliver a modest IOP reduction and therefore is likely more suited for patients with mild damage and a higher target IOP. The 1-year results from the Ahmed Baerveldt Comparison Study do not demonstrate a clear superiority of one implant over the other. These findings are consistent with prior retrospective studies in the literature.",

IOP was measured by Goldman applanation tonometery and color Doppler imaging was utilized to assess the retrobulbar blood vessels before and 1 month after treatment with topical brimonidine/timolol and dorzolamide/timolol.

Alpha-tocopherol succinate (VES) was first used as a co-stabilizer to enhance the stability of the nanosuspensions. The effects of the process parameters on particle size of the nanosuspensions were investigated. The optimal values of the precipitation temperature, power inputs, and the time length of ultrasonication were selected as 10\u00b0C, 400 W, and 15 min, respectively. Response surface methodology based on central composite design was utilized to evaluate the formulation factors that affect the size of nanosuspensions, i.e., the concentration of CAR and VES in the organic solution, and the level of sodium dodecyl sulfate in the anti-solvent phase, respectively. The optimized formulation showed a mean size of 212 \u00b1 12 nm and a zeta potential of -42 \u00b1 3 mV. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the nanosuspensions were flaky-shaped. Powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry analysis confirmed that the nanoparticles were in the amorphous state. Fourier transform infrared analysis demonstrated that the reaction between CAR and VES is probably due to hydrogen bonding. The nanosuspension was physically stable at 25\u00b0C for 1 week, which allows it to be further processing such as drying. The dissolution rate of the nanosuspensions was markedly enhanced by reducing the size. The in vivo test demonstrated that the C(max) and AUC(0-36) values of nanosuspensions were approximately 3.3- and 2.9-fold greater than that of the commercial tablets, respectively.", 
    "89": "Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels play a critical role in cardiac action potential repolarization. The unintended block of hERG channels by compounds can prolong the cardiac action potential duration and induce arrhythmia. Several compounds not only block hERG channels but also enhance channel activation after the application of a depolarizing voltage step. This is referred to as facilitation. In this study, we tried to extract the property of compounds that induce hERG channel facilitation. We first examined the facilitation effects of structurally diverse hERG channel blockers in Xenopus oocytes. Ten of 13 assayed compounds allowed facilitation, suggesting that it is an effect common to most hERG channel blockers. We constructed a pharmacophore model for hERG channel facilitation. The model consisted of one positively ionizable feature and three hydrophobic features. Verification experiments suggest that the model well describes the structure-activity relationship for facilitation. Comparison of the pharmacophore for facilitation with that for hERG channel block showed that the spatial arrangement of features is clearly different. It is therefore conceivable that two different interactions of a compound with hERG channels exert two pharmacological effects, block and facilitation.",

Female gender, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak VO2, peak systolic blood pressure, and beta-blocker treatment all contributed to increase the risk ability of the hierarchical multivariate model. Two-year survival was higher in women: 85 vs 66%; \u03c7(2)=15.7, p<0.0001. Peculiarly, outcome results were similar when only CVD was considered. Females showed a multivariate adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46. Since a 1-mL/kg/min increment in peak VO2 was equated with a 12% improvement in prognosis, the same gender adjusted HR was achieved when mean peak VO2 was reduced by 5 units in women: thus, a HF woman with peak VO2 of 9 mL/kg/min has the same 2-year outcome as a HF man with peak VO2 of 14 mL/kg/min.", 
    "93": "Although HF women have a comparatively lower peak VO2 than men, they live longer. We discovered that the traditional cut point value for peak VO2, i.e. \u2264 14 mL/kg/min is not a \"gender-neutral\" reference since lumping HF men and women together with the same VO2 value is unlikely to describe the true risk. These preliminary findings do underline the need to assimilate gender-specific issues into clinical practice in HF, when appropriate.", 
    "94": "Receptor internalization is a useful indicator of the activity of ligands. The N-terminus of the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor expressed on the cell surface was labeled with fluorophores using a novel coiled-coil labeling system. Endocytosis of the receptors was automatically detected using a fluorescence image analyzer by evaluating (1) translocation of the receptor from cell-surface to intracellular regions and (2) acidification in endosomes. Both parameters increased upon agonist stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. The extent of endocytosis was significantly dependent on the agonist used, indicating the presence of a biased signaling for endocytosis. The receptor antagonists can also be screened by competitive inhibition of agonist-induced endocytosis. The image analysis approach has proven to be useful for high-throughput characterization and screening of GPCR ligands.",

Arrhythmia of mice were induced by Chansu and then electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded. The changes of P-R interval, QRS complex, Q-T interval, T wave amplitude, heart rate (HR) were observed. Moreover, arrhythmia rate, survival rate and arrhythmia score were counted. Isolated mouse hearts were prefused, and the lethal dose of Chansu was recorded. Compared with control group, after pretreatment with phenytoin sodium, broadening of QRS complex and HR were inhibited, and the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia was reduced dramatically, while survival rate was improved; the isolated mouse hearts lethal dose of Chansu was increased significantly. After pretreatment with lidocaine, the prolongation of P-R interval and broadening of QRS complex were inhibited, and the incidences of ventricular arrhythmia were reduced dramatically, while survival rate was improved; the isolated mouse hearts lethal dose of Chansu was increased significantly. After pretreatment with propranolol, prolongation of P-R interval, broadening of QRS complex, prolongation of Q-T interval and HR were inhibited, and the incidences of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced dramatically, while survival rate was improved. After pretreatment with amiodarone, HR was inhibited, the incidences of ventricular tachycardia were reduced dramatically. Lastly, after pretreatment with verapamil, the prolongation of P-R interval and Q-T interval were inhibited and the incidences of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced dramatically; the isolated mouse hearts lethal dose of Chansu was reduced significantly. In in vivo experiments, phenytoin sodium was most effective against the mice arrhythmias induced by Chansu while cautious use of verapamil for Chansu inducing arrhythmia should be noted. It is also concluded that mice ventricular arrhythmias induced by Chansu might be most closely related to sodium channel, supraventricular arrhythmias might be related to beta-adrenergic receptor, and calcium channel plays an important role in conduction block. In in vitro experiments, phenytoin sodium was most effective, followed by lidocaine and propranolol, and amiodarone had no obvious effect and verapamil reduced the lethal dose of Chansu.",

Many reports showed that landiolol (ultra short-acting beta one blocker) and amiodarone were effective against postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). However, there were few comparative studies between these 2 drugs as prophylactic agents, and no report mentioned the therapeutic efficacy. Our study suggests that landiolol be the 1st choice for rate control of tachyarrhythmia because of easy dose adjustment and mild side effects.

    "102": "In patients with hypertension, 24-hour blood pressure control is the major therapeutic goal. The number of daily doses is one characteristic of an antihypertensive agent that may affect the adequacy of 24-hour control. One measure of therapeutic coverage is the 24-hour trough-to-peak ratio, which determines the suitability of an agent for once-daily administration. The closer an agent is to a 100% trough-to-peak ratio, the more uniform the 24-hour coverage and therefore blood pressure control. High trough-to-peak ratio, long-acting antihypertensive medications lower blood pressure more gradually, which reduces the likelihood of adverse events attributable to abrupt drug action that occurs with shorter-acting agents. In hypertension, the natural diurnal variation of blood pressure may be altered, including elevated nighttime pressures. An optimal once-daily hypertension therapy would not only lower blood pressure but also normalize any blunted circadian variations in blood pressure. The benefits of once-daily agents with sustained therapeutic coverage may also be explained, in part, by increased patient adherence to simpler regimens as well as lower loss of blood pressure control during virtually inevitable intermittent noncompliance. Studies have demonstrated that once-daily antihypertensive agents have the highest adherence compared with twice-daily or multiple daily doses, including greater adherence to the prescribed timing of doses.",

In addition, the tolerability and safety of titration to a carvedilol CR dose up to 80 mg/day were examined, as were plasma concentrations of carvedilol and changes in vital signs. The proportions of patients who completed 40-mg/day carvedilol CR and 20-mg/day carvedilol IR were 42% (8/19) and 50% (11/22), respectively. In the CR group, 7/19 (37%) attained a dose of 80 mg.

Bilateral electrolytic LC lesions blocked the ability of icv alcohol to stimulate ACTH secretion. Pretreatment with icv propranolol increased basal ACTH secretion levels, but icv alcohol did not increase this effect. Propranolol also blunted icv alcohol-induced PVN Fos expression. A low dose of phenoxybenzamine, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, did not affect the ability of icv alcohol to stimulate ACTH release. However, a higher dose of the drug was able to block the ACTH response to icv alcohol. Despite this, phenoxybenzamine did not inhibit alcohol-induced Fos expression.

T2DM is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality related to the associated atherosclerotic cardiovascular risks and diabetic vasculopathies, including microangiopathies (e.g., blindness and renal failure) and macroangiopathies (atherosclerosis). The increasing global prevalence of T2DM is linked to the rising rates of obesity, especially abdominal obesity. Visceral fat accumulation is upstream of obesity-related disorders including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ACVD), and is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity and atherosclerosis through dysregulated production of adipocytokines, especially hypoadiponectinemia. This review article discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for T2DM and atherosclerosis, focusing on adiponectin. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that hypoadiponectinemia contributes to a variety of life style-related diseases including T2DM and atherosclerosis. It is likely that life-style modification, visceral fat reduction and use of medications that increase serum adiponectin levels (e.g., rimonabant, thiazolidinediones, fibrates, angiotensin receptor blocker and mineralocorticoid receptor blockade) when provided in combination can improve hypoadiponectinemia and thus prevent the development of life style-related diseases including T2DM and ACVD.",

    "138": "Despite significant advances in pharmacological and clinical treatment, heart failure (HF) remains the number one killer disease in the western world. HF is a chronic and progressive clinical syndrome mainly characterized by reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and adverse remodeling of the myocardium. One of its hallmark molecular abnormalities is elevation of cardiac G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinase (GRK)-2, originally termed beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 (\u03b2ARK1), a member of the GRK family of serine/threonine protein kinases which phosphorylate and desensitize GPCRs. Up-regulated GRK2 in the heart underlies the diminished contractile responsiveness of the heart to positive inotropes, as it abrogates the pro-contractile signaling of various important cardiac receptors: mainly \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs), but also angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)Rs), etc. Thus, cardiac-specific GRK2 inhibition via various transgenic approaches is postulated to combat chronic HF symptoms by increasing cardiac function, and even be salutary in some cases by increasing survival. This has been extensively documented over the past 15 years through a vast series of preclinical studies on animals of all sizes and shapes, from small mice up to large rabbits and pigs closely resembling human physiology, and genetically manipulated to have cardiac GRK2 inhibited or deleted, transiently or permanently. However, over the past several years, it has become increasingly clear that GRK2, like other members of the GRK family, exerts additional effects that can aggravate HF, in addition to merely blunt cardiac contractility by opposing cardiac \u03b2AR G protein-mediated signaling. One of these newly discovered cardiotoxic effects of GRK2, uncovered by our laboratory, is promotion by adrenal GRK2 of sympathetic hyperactivity of the failing heart, a significant morbidity factor in HF, targeted therapeutically nowadays by the use of beta-blockers in HF pharmacotherapy. Thus, new avenues for therapeutic exploitation of GRK2 inhibition in HF treatment might be possible in the near future. The present review gives first a brief account of what has already been documented about the benefits of cardiac GRK2 genetic manipulation in HF as a positive inotropic therapy for the disease, and then goes on to discuss in detail the intriguing new possibility that has emerged of lowering GRK2 activity in the adrenal gland, which could constitute a novel sympatholytic therapy for HF that helps relieve the devastatingly cardiotoxic sympathetic overload of the failing heart.",

Seventeen CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors were incubated with hepatocytes in human plasma or hepatocyte maintenance medium (HMM) for 20 min over a range of concentrations after which midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation or (R)-bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation were used to quantify the corresponding cytochrome P450 (P450) catalytic activities. Two methods were used to predict the human exposure ratio of the victim drug in the presence and absence of inhibitor. The HMM K(i, app) values were combined with the free average systemic plasma concentration (\"free [I] with HMM K(i, app)\") and the plasma K(i, app) values were combined with the total average systemic plasma concentration (\"total [I] with plasma K(i, app)\"). Of 63 clinical DDI studies, the total [I] with plasma K(i, app) method predicted 89% of cases within 2-fold of the reported interaction whereas the free [I] with HMM K(i, app) method predicted only 59%. There was a general underprediction by the free [I] with HMM K(i, app) method, which is consistent with an underestimation of in vitro inhibition potency in this system.

The results provide an experiment-based perspective for resolving differing reports on purinergic activation of the tissues and uncertain roles of large-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK(Ca)) and voltage-gated delayed rectifier K(+) (K(V)) channels. \u03b1,\u03b2-Methylene ATP (3-100 \u03bcm) evoked suramin-sensitive contractions of longitudinal muscle but rarely of circular muscle. ATP (0.1-3 mm) less reliably activated only longitudinal muscle contractions. These were enhanced by ARL 67156 (100 \u03bcm), but a different ectonucleotidase inhibitor, POM 1, was ineffective. Both muscle types were unresponsive to ADP-\u03b2S (100 \u03bcm), a P2Y-purinoceptor agonist. Longitudinal muscle contractions in response to \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP were enhanced by FPL 64176 (1 \u03bcm), an L-type Ca(2+) agonist, TEA (1 mm), a non-specific K(+) channel blocker, 4-aminopyridine (0.3 mm), a selective blocker of K(V) channels, and iberiotoxin (0.1 \u03bcm), a selective blocker of BK(Ca) channels. Quiescent circular muscles responded to \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP reliably in the presence of FPL 64176 or iberiotoxin. Apamin (0.1 \u03bcm), a selective blocker of small conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK(Ca)) channels had no effect in both muscle types. Y-27632 (1-10 \u03bcm) reduced longitudinal muscle contractions in response to \u03b1,\u03b2-meATP, suggesting involvement of Rho-kinase-dependent contractile mechanisms. The results indicate that P2X(1)-purinoceptor stimulation elicits excitatory effects that: (a) lead to longitudinal muscle contraction and secondary activation of 4-aminopyridine-sensitive (K(V)) and iberiotoxin-sensitive (BK(Ca)) K(+) channels; and (b) are subcontractile in circular muscle due to ancillary activation of BK(Ca) channels. The novel finding of differential action by P2X(1)-purinoceptor agonists in the muscle types has functional implication in terms of the purinergic contribution to overall contractile function of human vas deferens. The modulatory effects of K(V) and BK(Ca) channels following P2X(1)-purinoceptor activation may be pivotal in providing the crucial physiological mechanism that ensures temporal co-ordination of longitudinal and circular muscle contractility.",

The NMDA receptor consists of a voltage-dependent channel permeable to Ca(2+) and Na(+) . In Alzheimer's disease, neuronal degeneration is thought to cause an excessive release of glutamate to the extracellular space, which may in turn mediate prolonged stimulation of the NMDA receptor complex and, as a consequence, excessive calcium influx into neuronal cells, leading to subsequent cell death. This process is called glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, and its inhibition may present an effective antidementive therapy.

Off-therapy exercise testing triggered the onset of VAs at different heart rates (mean 132 \u00b1 13 beats/min) with various patterns that worsened while exercising and disappeared immediately after stopping. The most severe VAs detected were nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 35% and ventricular couplets in 35%. In the remaining subjects single ventricular premature beats were recorded. In 15% of patients single monomorphic ventricular premature beats were detected and identified to be linked to RyR2 mutations owing to the presence of sudden deaths of their family members and subsequent family screening. Acebutolol made the VAs disappear completely in 20% of subjects and decreased their complexity in 50%, whereas it did not change VAs appreciably in 30% of patients with less complex VAs. After 11 \u00b1 8 years of follow-up 2 patients developed syncope. In conclusion, exercise testing was a fundamental tool for assessing the clinical phenotype and efficacy of therapy in RyR2 mutation carriers and therapy with acebutolol led in most subjects to a decreased complexity of the arrhythmic pattern or to complete suppression.",

This was accomplished by investigating the effects of noxious stimulation to the orofacial area with capsaicin, and by microinjecting GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor agonists or antagonists into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), on masseter hemodynamics in urethane-anesthetized rats. Electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the cervical vagus nerve (cVN) in sympathectomized animals bilaterally increased blood flow in the masseter muscle (MBF). Increases in MBF evoked by cVN stimulation were markedly reduced following injection of capsaicin into the anterior tongue in the distribution of the lingual nerve or lower lip, but not when injected into the skin of the dorsum of the foot. Intravenous administration of either phentolamine or propranolol had no effect on the inhibitory effects of capsaicin injection on the increases of MBF evoked by cVN stimulation, which were largely abolished by microinjecting the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen into the NTS. Microinjection of the GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP-35348 into the NTS markedly attenuated the capsaicin-induced inhibition of MBF increase evoked by cVN stimulation, while microinjection of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline did not.

    "168": "Human glomerular mesangial cells (HMCs) have a finite lifespan, and eventually enter irreversible growth arrest known as cellular senescence, which is thought to contribute to kidney ageing and age-related kidney disorders, such as chronic kidney disease. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a latent transcription factor involved in a variety of signal transduction pathways, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, but whether it could regulate HMC senescence still remains to be explored. In our study, the induction of angiotensin II (Ang\u2009II)-accelerated HMC senescence, as judged by increased senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal)-positive staining cells, morphological changes, and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. STAT1 activity and the expression of p53 and p21(Cip1) were increased after Ang\u2009II treatment. STAT1 knockdown using RNA interference significantly inhibited the progression of HMC senescence and decreased the elevated expression of p53 and p21(Cip1). Pretreating HMCs with Ang\u2009II receptor blocker losartan also inhibited the progression of HMC senescence and STAT1 activity. Our results indicate that STAT1 is implicated in the mediation of Ang II-induced HMC senescence through p53/ p21(Cip1) pathway, and that losartan could attenuate HMC senescence by regulating STAT1. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine reduced ROS production and STAT1 activity induced by Ang\u2009II, indicating that Ang\u2009II uses ROS as a second messenger to regulate STAT1 activity.",

    "174": "Headache prevention in adults with chronic migraine is based first on oral drug therapy, preferably with propranolol, and on tapering off possible analgesic overuse. Botulinum toxin type A injections in head and neck muscles is now authorised for this purpose in the United Kingdom. It has been used off label for several years. Clinical evaluation in this indication is based on two placebo-controlled double-blind trials with identical designs. A total of 1384 patients underwent two sessions of intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A or placebo, 3 months apart, into at least 31 specific sites in the head and neck. Compared to baseline, patients who received botulinum toxin in one trial (but not in the other) experienced a statistically significant reduction in headache frequency at the end of the study, but the results are undermined by methodological issues. Botulinum toxin type A has not been compared with preventive oral therapy. An inherently unreliable indirect comparison suggests that botulinum toxin type A is clearly less effective than oral propranolol. In its other approved indications, botulinum toxin type A has been linked to deaths and muscle paralysis distant from the injection site, leading to swallowing difficulties and respiratory disorders. Some patients enrolled in clinical trials of botulinum toxin type A experienced transient worsening of their migraine and headache (9.3%, versus 5.8% of patients receiving placebo injections), exaggerated paralytic effects, and muscle pain and stiffness. In practice, given its uncertain efficacy, at best only modest, botulinum toxin type A is simply too risky a treatment for migraine. It is better to focus on fine tuning of standard prophylaxis.", 
    "175": "Prejunctional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) amplify postganglionic sympathetic neurotransmission, and there are indications that intraterminal Ca(2+) stores might be involved. However, the mechanisms by which nAChR activation stimulates neurotransmitter release at such junctions is unknown. Rapid local delivery (picospritzing) of the nAChR agonist epibatidine was combined with intracellular sharp microelectrode recording to monitor spontaneous and field-stimulation-evoked neurotransmitter release from sympathetic nerve terminals in the mouse isolated vas deferens. Locally applied epibatidine (1 \u00b5M) produced 'epibatidine-induced depolarisations' (EIDs) that were similar in shape to spontaneous excitatory junction potentials (SEJPs) and were abolished by nonselective nAChR antagonists and the purinergic desensitizing agonist \u03b1,\u03b2-methylene ATP. The amplitude distribution of EIDs was only slightly shifted towards lower amplitudes by the selective \u03b17 nAChR antagonists \u03b1-bungarotoxin and methyllcaconitine, the voltage-gated Na(+) channel blocker tetrodotoxin or by blocking voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels with Cd(2+). Lowering the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration reduced the frequency of EIDs by 69%, but more surprisingly, the Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release blocker ryanodine greatly decreased the amplitude (by 41%) and the frequency of EIDs by 36%. Ryanodine had no effect on electrically-evoked neurotransmitter release, paired-pulse facilitation, SEJP frequency, SEJP amplitude or SEJP amplitude distribution. These results show that activation of non-\u03b17 nAChRs on sympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals induces high-amplitude junctional potentials that are argued to represent multipacketed neurotransmitter release synchronized by intraterminal Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, triggered by Ca(2+) influx directly through the nAChR. This nAChR-induced neurotransmitter release can be targeted pharmacologically without affecting spontaneous or electrically-evoked neurotransmitter release.", 
    "176": "Infantile haemangiomas are common vascular tumours of infancy. They typically present shortly after birth, undergo a period of rapid proliferation, and then slowly involute over many years. Although most patients require no intervention, appropriate investigation and treatment may be necessary in a minority of cases. Identifying which patients require further investigation or intervention can be difficult due to the heterogeneity of clinical presentation. This is compounded by a lack of rigorous randomised controlled trials on haemangioma management. Therefore, the rationale for treatment is not always straightforward. Haemangiomas occur anywhere on the body, have superficial, deep or mixed morphology, and depending on anatomic location, size and subtype, can be associated with underlying structural anomalies and many other potential complications. Generally, the management of difficult haemangiomas is best approached on a case-by-case basis. Over the last few years, there have been several advances in our understanding of haemangiomas, together with some exciting new therapeutic options. In the following review, the authors discuss the various possible complications of infantile haemangiomas, the rationale for treatment and appropriate possible interventions.", 
    "177": "Agonistic autoantibodies to the \u03b2-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors are a novel investigative and therapeutic target for certain orthostatic disorders. We have identified the presence of autoantibodies to \u03b22-adrenergic and/or M3 muscarinic receptors by ELISA in 75% (15 of 20) of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension. Purified serum IgG from all 20 of the patients and 10 healthy control subjects were examined in a receptor-transfected cell-based cAMP assay for \u03b22 receptor activation and \u03b2-arrestin assay for M3 receptor activation. There was a significant increase in IgG-induced activation of \u03b22 and M3 receptors in the patient group compared with controls. A dose response was observed for both IgG activation of \u03b22 and M3 receptors and inhibition of their activation with the nonselective \u03b2 blocker propranolol and muscarinic blocker atropine. The antibody effects on \u03b22 and/or M3 (via production of NO) receptor-mediated vasodilation were studied in a rat cremaster resistance arteriole assay. Infusion of IgG from patients with documented \u03b22 and/or M3 receptor agonistic activity produced a dose-dependent vasodilation. Sequential addition of the \u03b2-blocker propranolol and the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester partially inhibited IgG-induced vasodilation (percentage of maximal dilatory response: from 57.7\u00b110.4 to 35.3\u00b14.6 and 24.3\u00b15.8, respectively; P<0.01; n=3), indicating that antibody activation of vascular \u03b22 and/or M3 receptors may contribute to systemic vasodilation.

    "189": "The close apposition between sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve terminals in the adventitia of cerebral arteries provides morphological evidence that sympathetic nerve activation causes parasympathetic nitrergic vasodilation via a sympathetic-parasympathetic interaction mechanism. The decreased parasympathetic nerve terminals in basilar arteries (BA) of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and renovascular hypertensive rats (RHR) compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), therefore, would diminish this axo-axonal interaction-mediated neurogenic vasodilation in hypertension. Increased basilar arterial blood flow (BABF) via axo-axonal interaction during sympathetic activation was, therefore, examined in anesthetized rats by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Electrical stimulation (ES) of sympathetic nerves originating in superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and topical nicotine (10-30 \u03bcM) onto BA of WKY significantly increased BABF. Both increases were inhibited by tetrodotoxin, 7-nitroindazole (neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), and ICI-118,551 (\u03b2(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), but not by atenolol (\u03b2(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist). Topical norepinephrine onto BA also increased BABF, which was abolished by atenolol combined with 7-nitroindazole or ICI-118,551. Similar results were found in prehypertensive SHR. However, in adult SHR and RHR, ES of sympathetic nerves or topical nicotine caused minimum or no increase of BABF. It is concluded that excitation of sympathetic nerves to BA in WKY causes parasympathetic nitrergic vasodilation with increased BABF. This finding indicates an endowed functional neurogenic mechanism for increasing the BABF or brain stem blood flow in coping with increased local sympathetic activities in acutely stressful situations such as the \"fight-or-flight response.\" This increased blood flow in defensive mechanism diminishes in genetic and nongenetic hypertensive rats due most likely to decreased parasympathetic nitrergic nerve terminals.",

SB-204741 treatment significantly ameliorated (P<0.05) myocardial dysfunction, myocyte area, fibrosis and myocardial architecture in isoproterenol insulted myocardium.

Although reversible, the cardiac effects of seizures are acutely life threatening, and may contribute to the delayed mortality following SE. The precise mechanisms mediating acute cardiac dysfunctions are not known. These studies evaluated effects of self-sustaining limbic SE in rats on cardiac performance 24h following seizures, and determined if sympathetic nervous system activation during seizures contributed to cardiac dysfunction. Rats subjected to SE received either vehicle (saline) or the B1 adrenergic antagonist atenolol (AT) prior to and during 90 min of seizure activity. Control rats were similarly treated, except they did not undergo seizures. Twenty-four hours after SE, animals were anesthetized and catheterized for measurement of cardiac performance variables. Animals undergoing SE demonstrated significantly reduced cardiac output, decreased ventricular contractility and relaxation, increased blood pressure, and prolonged QT interval. However, heart rate was not altered. Treatment with AT prevented all changes in cardiac performance due to SE, and attenuated the increase in QT interval. These data demonstrate that SE in the rat results in cardiac dysfunction 24h following seizures, mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.",

As a consequence of adrenal cortex destruction, the patient developed subclinical hypoaldosteronism which was effectively treated with small doses of fludrocortisone. Two and fours years later, she required ibuprofen and atenolol treatment and each of these treatments was accompanied by a transient deterioration in mineralocorticoid activity which resolved after drug withdrawal. This case shows for the first time that drugs reducing plasma renin activity may unmask subclinical hypoaldosteronism in subjects with autoimmune polyglandular syndromes, and that they should be avoided in patients with even small disturbances in the hormonal function of the zona glomerulosa."
