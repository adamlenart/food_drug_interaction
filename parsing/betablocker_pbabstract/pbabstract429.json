    "0": "More than 50% of the U.S. population 65 years and older have elevated systolic pressure with or without elevated diastolic pressure--and thus in either case are at risk for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular sequelae. As therapy lowers diastolic pressure, however, mortality can increase, presumably when blood pressure is brought down to levels that compromise perfusion.", 
    "1": "In open chest anaesthetised dogs, dofetilide increased the ventricular effective refractory period over the dose range 1-100 micrograms/kg i.v. and the ventricular fibrillation threshold at doses between 3-100 micrograms/kg and was 80-1000 times more potent than sematilide, racemic sotalol, d-sotalol or quinidine. The maximal increases in ventricular fibrillation threshold induced by sematilide and quinidine were less than that induced by the other drugs. A change in the character of the induced arrhythmia from true ventricular fibrillation to a rapid ventricular flutter, with frequent spontaneous conversion, was observed following all drugs. No adverse haemodynamic effects of dofetilide, sematilide or d-sotalol were observed, but quinidine induced marked cardiac depression and racemic sotalol also impaired left ventricular contractility. All drugs reduced heart rate, though the effect of racemic sotalol was clearly greater than that of the other agents. Dofetilide is a potent class III antiarrhythmic agent with antifibrillatory properties and a favourable haemodynamic profile.", 
    "2": "Beta-Adrenoceptor agonists were administered i.p. into rats and amino acid levels in brain and plasma were then determined to assess the effects on transport across the blood-brain barrier. Isoproterenol (10 mumol/kg) caused significant increases in aromatic amino acid (tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan) levels in cerebral cortex and decreases in almost all amino acid concentrations in plasma. This effect of isoproterenol on brain tyrosine level was dose-dependent with an ED50 of 0.25 mumol/kg. Salbutamol (beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, 10 mumol/kg) showed similar effects, but dobutamine (beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, 50 mumol/kg) failed to increase brain amino acid levels. When 1-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA, 100 mumol/kg) was i.p. loaded, beta-adrenoceptor agonists promoted the transport of L-DOPA into brain without increasing the clearance rate of plasma L-DOPA. Moreover, significant increases in dopamine and its metabolites were observed in rat brain. These findings suggest that the transport of aromatic amino acids across the blood-brain barrier may be regulated through beta 2-adrenoceptors and that co-administration of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists with L-DOPA may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA.", 
    "3": "The effects of three beta-adrenoceptor blockers atenolol, indenolol and nadolol on myocardial mitochondrial ATPase (ATP: phosphohydrolase EC 3.6.1.3) activity were evaluated and compared with that of propranolol in guinea pig heart preparations. Propranolol and indenolol inhibited ATPase activity with IC50 values of 4.4 +/- 0.5 and 5.3 +/- 0.4 mM, respectively. In contrast, however, nadolol and atenolol markedly enhanced mitochondrial ATPase activity. Atenolol increased the enzyme activity by approximately 5, 240 and 950%, while nadolol enhanced it by 13, 280 and 2800% at 100 microM, 1.0 mM and 10.0 mM, respectively. The results indicate that these drugs exhibit two modes of interaction with the mitochondrial ATPase: inhibition by propranolol and indenolol and stimulation by atenolol and nadolol. The inhibitory actions are probably related to the membrane-stabilizing effects and therefore antiarrhythmic actions of the two drugs, while the stimulatory effects of atenolol and nadolol are probably a result of interactions with some component of oxidative phosphorylation or the respiratory chain.", 
    "4": "The non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (dizocilpine), induces in rats a characteristic behavioural syndrome with ataxia, stereotypies and hyperlocomotion. At least part of this behavioural syndrome is thought to be related to interactions between glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. Based on recent biochemical evidence that serotonin (5-HT) might also be involved in the effects of MK-801 several 5-HT receptor ligands were tested for effects on MK-801-induced behaviours. The 5-HT1A receptor ligands, ipsapirone and NAN-190, which are known to display antagonist-like properties in functional models of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor activity attenuated or blocked the hyperlocomotion and head weaving observed after administration of MK-801, whereas the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin, was ineffective in this respect. The dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, also attenuated behaviours induced by MK-801. In contrast to its effects on stereotypies induced by MK-801, ipsapirone potentiated rather than attenuated the stereotyped behaviour induced by the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, indicating that antagonism of MK-801-induced stereotypies by ipsapirone may not be related to the dopaminergic system. The data indicate that, in addition to catecholaminergic systems, serotonergic neurotransmission is significantly involved in the mechanisms by which MK-801 alters behaviour in rats.", 
    "5": "In the present paper, we have studied the effect of lithium on cAMP levels induced by isoprenaline and norepinephrine in the presence of alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Our results show that low lithium concentrations, starting at 0.3 x 10(-3) M, have a significant inhibitory effect on cAMP content induced by isoprenaline in brain tissue pretreated with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of lithium on cAMP levels induced by norepinephrine when beta-adrenoceptors are blocked with propranolol, is observed at concentrations starting at 2.5 x 10(-3) M. These results show that in the presence of alpha blockade, low lithium concentrations which are within the therapeutic plasma range for treatment of manic patients, are able to act on an adenylate cyclase-cAMP system coupled to beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "6": "The aim was to evaluate in a minipig model of acute myocardial infarction the cardioprotection provided by the beta adrenoceptor blocking and vasodilating activities present in carvedilol; comparison was made to the pure beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol.", 
    "7": "Experiments were performed in 25 Yucatan minipigs (9-12 kg), randomly assigned to receive vehicle (n = 7), carvedilol 0.3 mg.kg-1 (n = 6), carvedilol 1 mg.kg-1 (n = 6), or propranolol 1 mg.kg-1 (n = 6). Myocardial infarction was produced by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 45 min followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Vehicle, carvedilol (0.3 and 1 mg.kg-1) or propranolol (1 mg.kg-1) were given intravenously 15 min before the coronary artery occlusion. At the end of the reperfusion period, infarct size was determined using Evans blue dye and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Infarct volumes were visualised using computer assisted three dimensional image analysis of the stained myocardial tissue sections. Myeloperoxidase activity was measured in tissue samples removed from normal, infarcted, and at risk areas.", 
    "8": "Carvedilol (1 mg.kg-1) reduced infarct size by over 90% without producing pronounced changes in systemic haemodynamic variables. The ability of carvedilol to reduce infarct size was clearly dose dependent. Thus infarct size, which represented 27.5(SEM 2.3)% of the area at risk in the vehicle treated group, was only 13.1(4.0)% (p < 0.05) and 2.4(1.5)% (p < 0.01) in pigs treated with carvedilol at 0.3 and 1 mg.kg-1, respectively. In animals treated with propranolol (1 mg.kg-1), infarct size represented 10.9(2.4)% of the area at risk (p < 0.05). The 60% and 91% reductions in infarct size produced by propranolol (1 mg.kg-1) and carvedilol (1 mg.kg-1), respectively, were clearly evident upon three dimensional image analysis. The reduction in infarct size was significantly greater for carvedilol (1 mg.kg-1) compared to propranolol (1 mg.kg-1) at equivalent beta adrenoceptor blocking doses. Pretreatment with propranolol did not reduce the increases in myeloperoxidase activity observed in the area at risk or in the infarcted area. In contrast, carvedilol produced a dose dependent reduction in myeloperoxidase activity in these areas.", 
    "9": "Carvedilol limits myocardial necrosis resulting from coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion in a more pronounced manner than the pure beta adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. The cardioprotective effect of carvedilol, which reduced infarct size by 91%, may result from the combined effects of beta adrenoceptor blockade and vasodilatation, and possibly also from inhibition of intracellular calcium overload in cardiac cells resulting from antagonism of myocardial alpha 1 adrenoceptors and/or calcium channel blockade. The cardioprotection provided by carvedilol may ultimately be of benefit in hypertensive patients who are at risk for acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "10": "Two high-performance liquid chromatographic analytical methods have been developed for the measurement of dl-sotalol or d-sotalol and l-sotalol in plasma, using dl-atenolol as internal standard. Quantitation of dl-sotalol was carried out, following solid-phase extraction, on a 5-microns C18 reversed-phase column, with a mobile phase containing acetonitrile, ion-pairing reagent and distilled water, using ultraviolet detection at 235 nm. Quantitation of d-sotalol and l-sotalol was based on derivatisation with the chiral agent S-(-)-alpha-methylbenzyl isocyanate, followed by chromatographic separation on a 3-microns C18 reversed-phase column, with a mobile phase containing methanol, glacial acetic acid and distilled water, with fluorimetric detection at 220 nm excitation and 300 nm emission. A preliminary application of the latter method suggests that the disposition of sotalol in humans is not enantioselective.", 
    "11": "Carvedilol produced a dose-dependent inhibition of superoxide (O2-) release from human neutrophils (PMNs) (IC50 = 28 microM) and scavenged O2- generated during dihydroxyfumaric acid (DHF) autooxidation (IC50 = 41 microM). Other beta-blockers, such as celiprolol, labetalol and atenolol, or the antioxidant, 'lazaroid', U74500A had no effect on O2- either released from PMNs or generated during DHF autooxidation. Propranolol, at 0.3 mM, inhibited O2- release from PMNs (73%) but failed to scavenge O2- generated from DHF. The novel free radical-scavenging effect of carvedilol may contribute to the cardioprotective activity of the compound.", 
    "12": "In a double-blind, randomized, controlled prospective study, 30 grade ASA I/II patients received a continuous i.v. infusion of normal saline or esmolol hydrochloride before induction of anaesthesia and tracheal intubation. Arterial pressure and heart rate were measured to assess the pressor response to laryngoscopy and intubation. The heart rate decreased in the esmolol group before induction of anaesthesia. The pressor response to laryngoscopy was significantly less marked in the esmolol group.", 
    "13": "For two weeks, with the exception of one case involving long-term therapy, 15 hypertensive patients received 100 mg of dilevalol once daily and seven patients received 50 mg. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured and digital pulse plethysmography (DPG) was performed before and after the two-week trial. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly during treatment; heart rate did not change. There were also significant changes on the three DPG measures of vasodilatation: peak amplitude increased, the dicrotic index decreased, and peak amplitude on the differentiated DPG increased. A weak correlation was found between the changes in systolic blood pressure and changes in the two measures of DPG peak amplitude. It is concluded that dilevalol is effective in the treatment of hypertension and that DPG is a sensitive noninvasive method to measure vasodilatation.", 
    "14": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of various formulations in maximizing the ratio of ocular to systemic absorption of topically applied timolol in the pigmented rabbit. Formulations of various pHs, tonicities, and concentrations of benzalkonium chloride, EDTA, poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), hydroxypropylcellulose, and Na hyaluronate were tested. Ocular absorption was determined by monitoring the timolol concentration in various anterior segment tissues 30 min after instillation of timolol solution, while systemic absorption was determined by monitoring the time course of timolol concentration over 120 min. Timolol was assayed by reversed-phase HPLC. Lowering the solution tonicity to 80 mosmol kg-1 and incorporating polymers into the formulation were the only approaches that promised to improve the safety of topically applied timolol, since they afforded the desired increase in ocular absorption and reduction in systemic absorption. Lowering the solution pH to 6.4 and increasing the tonicity of the solution to 600 mosmol kg-1 reduced systemic absorption but caused either no change or a decrease in ocular absorption. Raising the solution pH to 8.4 and incorporating 0.025% benzalkonium chloride and 0.5% EDTA into the formulation led to an undesirable increase in systemic absorption although ocular absorption was also increased. In the final analysis, the net effect of formulation changes on the ratio of ocular to systemic absorption depended on the interplay of changes in solution drainage; permeability of the cornea, conjunctiva, and nasal mucosa; and fraction of drug in the preferentially absorbed form.", 
    "15": "The magnitude of tolerance to the anti-anginal efficacy of transdermal nitroglycerin and the efficacy and safety of short (4 h) and long (10 h) nitrate-free intervals for its prevention, were investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 4 week-long treatment regimens: placebo, continuous therapy with a 50 mg patch (10 mg.24 h-1), and 4 h and 10 h nitrate-free periods. Only patients showing greater than 1 min increase in time to 1 mm ST depression after acute patch administration were eligible. Twelve men completed the study. One other anti-anginal medication (a beta-blocker in nine and calcium antagonist in two) was permitted in a constant dose throughout the study. Patients underwent exercise testing on days 1 and 7 of each treatment period, and 24 h ambulatory ECG monitoring on day 6. Compared to placebo, transdermal nitroglycerin on day 1 significantly improved time to 1 mm ST depression by 35%, and time to angina, exercise duration and maximal workload by 21%, 13% and 9% respectively. These improvements were totally lost after 7 days' continuous therapy, but completely maintained by a 10 h nitrate-free period (improvements of 35%, 25%, 16% and 11% respectively) but not by a 4 h nitrate-free period (non-significant improvements of 15%, 2%, 4% and 1% respectively). The differences between 10 and 4 h nitrate-free were significant for each end-point. Neither duration of ambulatory ischaemia, nor the proportion of patients experiencing greater than or equal to 5 min ischaemia during the scheduled nitrate-free interval differed between treatments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "To investigate if blood pressure reduction per se may prevent progressive renal disease in aging spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), 15-month-old SHR were treated with the calcium antagonist felodipine, with the beta-blocker metoprolol or with the combination for six months. The combined regimen caused the greatest blood pressure reduction over time, metoprolol caused the least, while felodipine had an intermediate effect. At the end of treatment, urinary protein excretion and endogenous creatinine clearance were determined in rats kept in individual metabolic cages. At autopsy, the kidneys were histologically examined and indices of chronic progressive nephrosis and glomerular sclerosis were determined. A positive correlation was found between urinary protein excretion and glomerular sclerosis. Glomerular sclerosis was low in the groups of rats with high endogenous creatinine clearance. In both groups treated with felodipine, glomerular sclerosis and urinary protein excretion were significantly reduced compared to untreated controls. These results illustrate that the calcium antagonist felodipine attenuates proteinuria and glomerular sclerosis in aging SHR. The blood pressure reduction may be of major importance in this respect, although a direct action on the sclerotic process within the glomeruli may also contribute.", 
    "17": "The effects of a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug with beta-2 agonist activity (dilevalol 200 mg) on proteinuria and renal hemodynamics were evaluated in a double-blind crossover study versus an ACE inhibitor (enalapril 5 mg) in eight patients with glomerulonephritis, moderate renal function impairment and proteinuria greater than 1 g/24 hr. Patients were studied after a one week placebo phase while off all other medications, except steroids in a few cases, and after three weeks of treatment. A 10-day placebo washout perod was included between the various drug treatments. During each period renal hemodynamics were measured by clearance techniques, and urinary protein excretion as well as fractional clearance of albumin and IgG were determined. Both drugs reduced mean arterial pressure and proteinuria to a similar extent [mean arterial pressure: placebo 108 +/- 13 mm Hg; dilevalol 103 +/- 11 mm Hg (P less than 0.05); enalapril 103 +/- 12 mm Hg (P less than 0.05); protein excretion: placebo 5.1 +/- 4.2 g/day; dilevalol 3.3 +/- 3.0 g/day (P less than 0.05); enalapril 2.8 +/- 2.8 g/day (P less than 0.05)]. The antiproteinuric effect was greater with enalapril than dilevalol. Dilevalol reduced GFR [baseline inulin clearance: 73.3 +/- 38 ml/min/1.73 m2; after dilevalol: 63.3 +/- 28 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P less than 0.05)] and the decrease of proteinuria correlated positively with the reduction of GFR. Enalapril did not significantly lower the GFR (inulin clearance during enalapril 66.8 +/- 23 ml/min/1.73 m2) and the reduction of proteinuria did not correlate with the lowering of the GFR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "The effects of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) on adrenocortical function were investigated using several different preparations of adrenocortical tissue. VIP caused a significant increase in perfusion medium flow rate and in aldosterone and corticosterone secretion by the isolated perfused rat adrenal gland, with a threshold of 1 pmol in 200 microliters, but did not affect basal steroid secretion by collagenase-dispersed adrenocortical cells at any concentration used, from 10 pmol/l to 10 mumol/l. The presence of VIP (100 nmol/l) had no significant effect on the response of zona glomerulosa cells to stimulation by ACTH at any concentration. In incubations of intact adrenal capsular tissue, VIP (10 mumol/l) caused a significant stimulation of aldosterone secretion, and also induced a significant release of adrenaline into the incubation medium. Addition of (-)alprenolol (100 nmol/l), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, to the incubation medium significantly attenuated the response of capsular tissue to VIP. It is concluded that the effects of VIP on aldosterone, which are only seen when the architecture of the zona glomerulosa is preserved, may be mediated by the local release of adrenaline.", 
    "19": "We studied usefulness of iontophoresis on pain relief using several Ca channel blockers, propranolol and guanethidine. Subjects were 18 healthy adult volunteers. We used 4% lidocaine with/without several drugs (2 mg of nicardipine, verapamil, diltiazem, propranolol and 10mg of guanethidine), and evaluated the pain relief effect with Nakahama's algesimeter. In all groups except for propranolol group, the pain recognition time was elongated significantly in comparison with control. In making comparison between each Ca channel blocker, we did not observe any significant differences, but, in propranolol group, elongation of pain threshold time was observed in some subjects. During these processes, systemic blood pressure and heart rate showed no remarkable changes. Our results suggest that it is possible to achieve more prolonged analgesic effect by the Ca channel blockers.", 
    "20": "Coadministration of phenylephrine and increasing solution viscosity can decrease systemic timolol absorption after eyedrop application. In this study, changes in the heart rate of rabbits after non-viscous (1 cP) and viscous timolol-phenylephrine (330 cP) solution were compared with those after control timolol eyedrops. The resting heart rate of rabbits was not influenced by control timolol eyedrops (0.6 mg/ml, 25 microliters in both eyes). In contrast, control timolol eyedrops antagonized greatly isoproterenol-induced tachycardia for 120 min. Timolol (0.6 mg/ml)-phenylephrine (0.8 mg/ml) eyedrops (25 microliters in both eyes) antagonized the chronotropic effect of isoproterenol less than control timolol eyedrops for the first 10 min. Compared to control timolol eyedrops, administration of viscous timolol (0.3 mg/ml)-phenylephrine (0.8 mg/ml) solution (25 microliters in both eyes) lowered systemic beta-blocking activity of timolol for 120 min. Previously we have shown that compared to non-viscous (1 cP) timolol (5.0 mg/ml) eyedrop (25 microliters), viscous (330 cP) timolol (2.5 mg/ml)-phenylephrine (0.8 mg/ml) solution (25 microliters) results in equal or increased timolol concentrations in the ocular tissues. All three timolol eyedrops antagonized the isoproterenol-induced tachycardia more than buffer solution but the onset of significant beta-blocking effect induced by eyedrops varied from 3 min (control eyedrop) to 40 min (viscous eyedrop). Our results indicate that possible cardiac effects of ophthalmic timolol can be diminished by phenylephrine coadministration and increased solution viscosity.", 
    "21": "Sympathetic activations may deteriorate myocardial failure due to progression of myocardial cell injury. In the present study, to test whether microtubules, calcium ion (Ca2+) sensitive cytoskeletons, are disrupted by norepinephrine (NE) and whether beta-adrenoceptor antagonist could attenuate the disruption of microtubules, structures of microtubules are studied in rat hearts with continuous subcutaneous infusions of norepinephrine. In the sham operated rats the microtubules stained by immunohistochemical technique showed normal network structures. A low dose of NE infusion (2 micrograms/kg/h) for 6 h resulted in a minimal change in microtubule structures. However, infusion for 24 h of NE (2 micrograms/kg/h) and a large dose of NE infusion (20 micrograms/kg/h) for 6h caused disruptions of microtubules in small patchy lesions (8 +/- 3%, 12 +/- 4% of area, respectively). A large dose of NE infusion for 24 h increased systolic blood pressure from 116 +/- 6 to 152 +/- 4 mmHg and increased plasma NE concentration from 430 +/- 40 to 17100 +/- 3700 pg/ml and further disrupted the network of microtubules in 40 +/- 6% of the total area. Propranolol (500 micrograms/kg/h) markedly attenuated NE-induced disruptions of microtubules. Disruptions of microtubules may be one of the underlying mechanism of deterioration of myocardial failure in chronic heart failure in which sympathetic activity is markedly activated.", 
    "22": "The effect of a pre-operative dose of metoprolol on the catecholamine and cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation and surgery, cardiac complications and intra-operative blood loss, were studied in patients undergoing elective hysterectomy during general anaesthesia. The study was double-blind and placebo controlled. The patients received metoprolol 100 mg or placebo orally 1-25 h before anaesthesia. In patients given metoprolol, heart rate and mean arterial pressure were lower during the first 45 min of anaesthesia. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations increased in both groups in response to tracheal intubation and surgery, but were higher after metoprolol. The incidence of arrhythmias was less after metoprolol. The mean operative blood loss was greater in the placebo group (486 +/- 170 ml (SEM) compared to 231 +/- 43 ml (SEM) after metoprolol). We conclude that oral premedication with metoprolol attenuates the hypertensive response to tracheal intubation and reduces both arrhythmias and operative blood loss.", 
    "23": "A double-blind, randomised, controlled trial of forty patients was carried out to determine if oral atenolol pretreatment would reduce the incidence of tachycardia during carotid endarterectomy performed under cervical plexus block. Twenty patients received a placebo and twenty patients 50 mg of atenolol two hours prior to surgery. The superficial and deep cervical blocks were performed with 1.5% lignocaine containing 1:200,000 adrenaline. The patients were monitored with the V5 lead of the electrocardiogram and intra-arterial blood pressure. These measurements were recorded on a correctly calibrated paper recorder. Tachycardia (heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute for more than three minutes) occurred in thirteen patients in the placebo group and two patients in the atenolol group (P less than 0.01). There was no difference in the occurrence of bradycardia, hypotension or hypertension between the two groups. It is concluded that atenolol pretreatment is an effective method of reducing the incidence of tachycardia during carotid endarterectomy performed under cervical plexus blockade.", 
    "24": "Changes in beta-adrenoceptors, GTP binding (G) proteins and adenylate cyclase (AC) activity of ventral prostates of rats during aging were studied in these experiments. The density of beta-adrenoceptors increased markedly after birth, reaching a maximum in the tissues at 16 weeks of age and remained at this level for about 90 weeks. When stimulated by isoproterenol, the AC activity increased 4- and 22-fold in 2- and 8-week-old rats, respectively, but only 7-fold in both 16- and 104-week-old rats. Activation of AC by forskolin was the greatest during the 2 weeks after birth and then showed a sharp decrease, reaching a plateau in the tissues at 8 weeks. Bmax value of [35S]GTP gamma S binding to the tissues was the largest at 8 weeks. Pretreatment of the tissues with pertussis or cholera toxin caused age-dependent changes in both the binding abilities of Gi and Gs proteins to GTP that coincided with changes in the binding of G proteins to GTP. There was no difference between the abilities of Gi and Gs proteins to bind to GTP in the tissues of rats of the respective age. These results show that changes in the binding ability of G proteins to GTP influence the function of ventral prostates of rats during the aging process, and this is mediated through the regulation of AC activity.", 
    "25": "Monitor peptide stimulates cholecystokinin (CCK) release from the intestine, but the cellular mechanisms responsible for this effect are uncertain. In the present study, the roles of membrane potential difference and calcium influx in monitor peptide-mediated CCK release were examined in a perifusion system containing isolated mucosal cells from the rat duodenum. This method represents an in vitro system in which CCK-releasing cells can be challenged with secretagogues or other maneuvers to study the dynamics of hormone secretion. High concentrations of KCl (50 mM), which reduce electrical potential difference across the cell membrane, caused the release of CCK. This effect was inhibited by the calcium channel blocker MnCl2. Monitor peptide stimulated CCK release in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations from 3 x 10(-12) to 3 x 10(-8) M. The requirement for extracellular calcium in secretagogue-stimulated release of CCK was investigated using ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a calcium chelator, and MnCl2. A calcium-free environment supplemented with 2 mM EGTA completely inhibited CCK secretion in response to stimulatory doses of monitor peptide. CCK secretion was restored when calcium was reintroduced into the system. Similarly, MnCl2 completely blocked monitor peptide-stimulated CCK release. These data indicate that membrane depolarization and monitor peptide stimulate the release of CCK through calcium-dependent mechanisms, suggesting that increases in intracellular calcium within CCK cells are likely to be important in CCK release.", 
    "26": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether propranolol alone can improve mineral metabolic disorders in thyrotoxicosis. Ten Graves' disease patients and 11 normal age- and sex-matched controls participated in the study. In the untreated Graves' patients, serum levels of calcium (Ca), calcium x phosphorus product (Ca x P), urinary Ca, phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg), and hydroxyproline (Hp) were higher than in control subjects (P less than .05), intestinal Ca absorption was lower than in control subjects (P less than .05), and Ca, P, and Mg balance were negative (P less than .05). After 40 mg propranolol four times per day (qid) for 28 days, serum triiodothyronine (T3) had decreased (P less than .05), serum reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) increased (P less than .05), serum thyroxine (T4) remained unchanged (P greater than .05), serum Ca and urine Ca and Mg decreased (P less than .05), intestinal Ca absorption increased, Ca balance was corrected, and P and Mg balance was improved (P less than .05). Our results indicate that propranolol can improve the metabolic disorders in addition to the symptomatic manifestations of Graves' disease. The mechanism responsible for the improved mineral balance is unclear, but may be related to beta-adrenergic blockade, increased membrane stability, or a decrease in the thyrotoxic state caused by the therapeutically induced decrease in serum T3.", 
    "27": "All patients with unstable angina should be admitted to a coronary or an intensive care unit. There should be an attempt to classify the patient according to the proposed Braunwald nomenclature. If the patient has a secondary cause for unstable angina (e.g., tachyarrhythmia, heart failure, fever, thyrotoxicosis, severe hypertension, hypoxia, unusual emotional stress, or anemia), this condition should be treated initially with therapy specific for that etiology. If the patient does not have a secondary etiology, therapy should be initiated with nitrates, preferably intravenous nitroglycerin. Heparin should be concomitantly administered. If the patient cannot receive heparin, aspirin should be initiated. All patients should receive beta-blockers. If the patient cannot take a beta-blocker, a calcium antagonist (probably diltiazem) should be initiated. However, if the patient is refractory to beta-blockers, the dihydropyridine nifedipine should be added. Failure to all pharmacologic interventions necessitates a progressive invasive approach dictated by the potential surgical risk of the patient. Long-term aspirin and beta-blockers should be strongly considered.", 
    "28": "Racial differences in the antihypertensive response to propranolol are well documented. This study was conducted to determine whether differences between black subjects and white subjects in propranolol enantiomer pharmacokinetics and protein binding exist that may contribute to the response differences. Twenty-six healthy men (13 black and 13 white subjects) took 80 mg propranolol orally three times daily for 16 doses. Serum samples were collected for 12 hours after the last dose for analysis by chiral HPLC. Protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) for both propranolol enantiomers was lower in black subjects than in white subjects (e.g., l-propranolol AUC: 292 +/- 100 versus 394 +/- 121 ng.hr/ml, p less than 0.05) and apparent oral clearance was higher in black subjects than in white subjects (e.g., l-propranolol apparent oral clearance: 27.6 +/- 8.2 versus 20.6 +/- 7.0 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.05). Fraction unbound and unbound AUC were not statistically different between black subjects and white subjects for either enantiomer, although the lack of statistical significance may have been attributable to the small sample size. In summary, racial differences in unbound l-propranolol concentration probably do not explain the clinically observed differences in response to propranolol. However, the racial differences in apparent oral clearance suggest there may be racial differences in hepatic metabolism of propranolol.", 
    "29": "The apparent oral clearance of S(-)- and R(+)-propranolol as a function of age was evaluated in 53 healthy male volunteers (age range, 21 to 84 years) after a single 40 mg oral dose of the racemic mixture. No significant age-associated change in the total (bound plus unbound) and unbound S(-) and R(+) apparent oral clearance was observed (p greater than 0.05). Stereoselectivity in apparent oral clearance (both total and unbound) remained unaffected by advancing age (p greater than 0.05). The relationship between age and propranolol enantiomer plasma protein binding was also evaluated in 70 subjects, 53 of whom were from this study (age range, 21 to 89 years). Plasma free fractions for S(-)- and R(+)-propranolol were unchanged with increasing age (p greater than 0.05), even though the binding was stereoselective (plasma free fractions for R(+) greater than plasma free fractions for S(-); p less than 0.05). The findings from this relatively large and extensive study indicate that age does not influence the stereoselective disposition of propranolol.", 
    "30": "The effect of topical carteolol 1%, a beta-adrenergic blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on the retinal circulation was investigated in 15 normal subjects using laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic fundus photography. In a double-masked randomized design, one eye received one drop of carteolol 1% and the fellow eye one drop of placebo. Vessel diameter, maximum erythrocyte velocity, and volumetric blood flow rate were determined in a major temporal vein of each eye just before instillation of the drops and then 120 min later. No significant changes in heart rate or mean brachial artery blood pressure were detected after treatment. Intraocular pressure decreased by 28% in the carteolol-treated eye (P less than 0.0001) and by 15% in the placebo-treated eye (P less than 0.001). No significant changes in vessel diameter, maximum erythrocyte velocity, and volumetric blood flow rate were observed in the carteolol-treated eyes (0.3%, 4.3%, and 3.6%, respectively) or the placebo-treated eyes (0.5%, 5.8%, and 6.7%, respectively).", 
    "31": "The antihypertensive effect of captopril, metoprolol, and hydrochlorothiazide was compared in 23 non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetic patients less than or equal to 75 years of age, with borderline to moderate primary hypertension. In a double blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial the patients were treated with 25 to 50 mg captopril, 50 to 100 mg metoprolol, 12.5 to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo, each given twice daily for 8 weeks. Antidiabetic treatment remained unchanged during the study. After receiving placebo for a 4 week run-in period, arterial blood pressure was 168/101 +/- 93/10 (mean +/- SEM) mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure was lowered significantly during all active treatment periods compared to the placebo value of 97 +/- 2 mm Hg: captopril, 92 +/- 1 mm Hg; metoprolol, 90 +/- 1 mm Hg; hydrochlorothiazide, 91 +/- 1 mm Hg. Metabolic variables were not significantly altered by captopril and metoprolol, while hydrochlorothiazide treatment increased hemoglobin A1c from 7.5 +/- 0.3 to 8.2 +/- 0.4% (P less than .001), decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol from 1.19 +/- 0.08 to 1.10 +/- 0.06 mmol/L (P less than .05). Glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin excretion, orthostatic blood pressure response, and digital systolic blood pressure in the lower limb remained unchanged during the active treatment periods. The frequency of subjective adverse effects was acceptable during active treatment and not significantly different compared to placebo. We conclude that antihypertensive treatment for 8 weeks with captopril or metoprolol in NIDDM patients is well-tolerated and causes no deterioration in metabolic control and kidney function, while hydrochlorothiazide causes a slight deterioration in glycemic control and lipid profile.", 
    "32": "Functional effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) were investigated in isolated preparations of human and rabbit corpus cavernosum (CC) and human penile circumflex veins (CV). In all preparations, ET-1 induced slowly developing, concentration-dependent contractions. The threshold concentration of ET-1 in CV was approximately 10 and 112 times lower than the threshold concentrations in human and rabbit CC, respectively. Furthermore, the contractions in CV reached a defined maximum at 10(-7) M ET-1 (-log EC50 = 9.12 +/- 0.17), whereas no maximum was obtained in CC preparations within the concentration range used (less than or equal to 3 x 10(-7) M). Pretreatment with the Ca++ channel blocker nimodipine partly reduced the ET-1-induced contractions in human and rabbit CC, but had no significant effect on CV preparations. In a Ca(++)-free medium containing the chelator ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetra-acetic acid, the contractions induced by ET-1 were reduced, but not abolished, in all preparations. The contractions induced by ET-1 are thus mediated mainly by influx of Ca++, although there seem to exist differences in the relative contribution of L-type Ca++ channels in CC and CV. Furthermore, additional mechanisms beside Ca++ influx are likely to be involved in both tissues. A high density of [125I]ET-1 binding sites was observed throughout the stroma and in the muscle layer of the deep penile artery in both human and rabbit CC. In the human CV, numerous binding sites were observed, but no clear difference between the various structures of the vessel wall could be detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The effects of two beta-carbolines, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta- carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE) were assayed on rat aortic rings precontracted with different agonists. The beta-carbolines tested induced a concentration-dependent (2-200 microM) relaxation of aortic rings precontracted with 30 mM KCl. This relaxation was not modified by the removal of the rat aortic endothelium. Contractions elicited by the activation of either voltage-gated calcium channels (0.05 microM BAY K 8644) or receptor-operated calcium channels (0.1 microM norepinephrine), as well as contractions produced by the entry of calcium as a lipid-soluble complex (10 microM A23187), were also reduced by DMCM and by beta CCE. In addition, whereas DMCM did not modify calmodulin activity, both beta-carbolines inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (0.6-200 microM) the rat aortic cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity. Moreover, DMCM as well as beta CCE potentiated the relaxation of K(+)-contracted aortic rings induced by the stimulation of either adenylyl cyclase with forskolin (0.1-1 microM) or guanylyl cyclase with sodium nitroprusside (0.1-100 nM). The intracellular rat aortic levels of cyclic AMP measured in the presence of 0.1 microM forskolin were increased by 100% in the presence of DMCM. On the other hand, 6 microM DMCM potentiated the relaxation induced by nifedipine in K(+)-contracted aortic rings, whereas the K+ channel blocker 10 mM tetraethylammonium did not modify the relaxation elicited by DMCM in the norepinephrine-contracted preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "In isolated rat aorta, carotid artery, tail artery, rabbit aorta and mesenteric artery, but not in ear artery, 1 microM 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate (DPB) induced a sustained contraction. However, DPB increased cytosolic Ca++ concentration ([Ca++]i) only in rat aorta and carotid artery. Similar results were obtained with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, although the inactive phorbol ester, 4-alpha-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, was ineffective. In rat aorta, DPB-induced contraction was followed by an increase in 20 kDa myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Both contraction and MLC phosphorylation stimulated by DPB were greater than those due to high K+ for a given increase in [Ca++]i. A Ca++ channel blocker, verapamil, decreased the DPB-induced increments in [Ca++]i and MLC phosphorylation to their respective resting levels, although contraction was inhibited only slightly. In the absence of external Ca++ (with 0.5 mM ethyleneglycol bis(beta-aminoethyl-ether)tetraacetic acid), DPB induced sustained contraction without increasing [Ca++]i or MLC phosphorylation. This contraction was followed by an increase in stiffness and force recovery after a shortening step. These results suggest that the contraction induced by DPB in rat aorta is due to increase in [Ca++]i followed by MLC phosphorylation and Ca++ sensitization of MLC phosphorylation. In the presence of verapamil or in the absence of external Ca++, DPB may increase cross-bridge cycling by activating an unknown mechanism that is not dependent on an increase in MLC phosphorylation.", 
    "35": "Whereas previous reports describe the head-up tilt test for the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope, this study focuses on the events leading up to syncope. These events are part of a spectrum of neurocardiogenic instability; syncope is the extreme end point. This report is based on tilt studies of 108 patients, aged 4 to 22 years (mean 13), with histories of either unexplained syncope or episodes of visual blackout without loss of consciousness. The tilt study was positive in 74% of the patients. Five stages of neurocardiogenic instability were identified, ranging from excessive fluctuations in heart rate to full syncope. Uncommon reactions during the tilt study include dissociation of hypotension, bradycardia and vagal symptoms and extended asystole (greater than 6 seconds). Therapy with beta 1-selective blockers was highly successful in suppressing symptoms of neurocardiogenic instability. Repeat tilt testing with beta blockade has resulted in either normal or markedly improved stability in heart rate and blood pressure. Neurocardiogenic instability is a common condition occurring between age 10 and 20 years. It appears to be self-limited.", 
    "36": "The antiarrhythmic and hemodynamic effects of sotalol (160 to 480 mg/day), a beta-blocking agent that prolongs ventricular repolarization, were examined in 38 patients with complex symptomatic ventricular ectopic activity. During ambulatory monitoring, 24 patients (63%) exhibited a reduction of greater than 75% in single ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and greater than 90% reduction in repetitive arrhythmia. In contrast to the effects of other agents, left ventricular ejection fraction as determined by radionuclide angiography was not impaired, increasing slightly from 45 +/- 14% to 47 +/- 14% during therapy (p less than 0.05). Antiarrhythmic drug efficacy did not correlate with baseline ejection fraction or sotalol-induced changes in ventricular function. Late follow-up studies disclosed that antiarrhythmic efficacy and tolerance were maintained in the majority of patients. Repeat radionuclide angiography at 6 months revealed no late drug-induced depression of left ventricular function. Sotalol appears to be an effective and well tolerated agent for treatment of complex ventricular ectopic activity, even in the setting of compromised cardiac function.",

    "45": "A computer algorithm was developed to quantify the RTm and preceding RR intervals for each of more than 50,000 beats on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (Holter) recordings to evaluate the dynamic relation between repolarization duration and cycle length. The relation of RTm to the preceding RR interval (RTm/RR slope) was determined by the best-fit linear regression equation between these two parameters. Eleven normal subjects and 16 patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS) were investigated. Six of the normal subjects had Holter recordings obtained before and after beta-blocker therapy. beta-Blockers were associated with a significant (p = 0.005) reduction in the RTm/RR slope from 0.13 +/- 0.02 to 0.10 +/- 0.02. The mean value of the RTm/RR slope was significantly (p = 0.003) larger in the LQTS patients (0.21 +/- 0.08) than in normal subjects (0.14 +/- 0.03).", 
    "46": "These findings indicate that 1) quantification of the dynamic relation between ventricular repolarization and RR cycle length can be obtained on a large number of Holter-recorded heart beats; 2) beta-blockers reduce the RTm/RR slope in normal patients; and 3) LQTS patients have an exaggerated delay in repolarization at long RR cycle lengths.", 
    "47": "Manidipine, a Ca(2+)-channel blocker, at concentrations that lower elevated blood pressure, modulates the transcription rates of cytokine genes in the mesangial cells of humans that had been stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor BB isomer; although the transcription for mRNA of interleukin 1 beta and granulocyte/monocyte colony-stimulating factor was inhibited, the transcription of mRNA for interleukin 6 was enhanced. Additionally, the induction of c-fos, c-jun, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase transcription was inhibited by manidipine. We conclude that manidipine, at nanomolar concentrations, is efficacious in modulating gene transcriptions that are involved in proinflammatory changes of mesangial cells. Thus, manidipine, at pharmacological concentrations that are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those required for inhibition of agonist- or depolarization (K+)-induced vasoconstriction, causes changes in the activity of the genes that code for inflammatory mediators.", 
    "48": "We recently reported that ritanserin, a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, induced significant reduction of portal pressure in cirrhotic rats. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects of a combination of propranolol and ritanserin in conscious and unrestrained cirrhotic rats. Heparinized catheters exiting from the neck were placed into the portal vein, inferior vena cava, aorta and left ventricle. Cardiac output and regional blood flows were measured with radiolabeled microspheres and the reference-sample method. Serial hemodynamic studies were performed 4 hr after rats awakened (basal), 1 hr after administration of ritanserin (0.63 mg/kg body wt, intravenously) and after intravenous propranolol infusion (0.33 mg/kg/min for 15 min) in nine cirrhotic rats. Similar measurements were obtained in a control group of eight cirrhotic rats treated with the solvents of ritanserin and propranolol. Ritanserin caused significant reduction of portal pressure (-19%). Portal-venous inflow and splanchnic arteriolar resistances remained unchanged, whereas portal-venous resistances were slightly but significantly lowered (-17%); and ritanserin had no effects on systemic hemodynamics. The addition of propranolol resulted in further reduction of portal pressure (-24%); the final reduction after combined therapy was -38%. Propranolol induced a marked decrease in cardiac output (-31%) and portal-venous inflow (-30%). It also caused a significant increase in splanchnic arteriolar resistance (+39%), but did not magnify the ritanserin-induced decrease of portal-venous resistance. The combined therapy did not modify the mean arterial pressure. Our results show that the effects of ritanserin on portal pressure--probably mediated by a reduction of intrahepatic and/or portocollateral resistances--can be potentiated by propranolol, which lowers the portal-venous inflow.",

This prospective randomized study aimed to assess if propranolol together with sclerotherapy could reduce the rebleeding rate before variceal obliteration. Seventy-five patients (59 male, 16 female; mean age, 54 +/- 15 years) with cirrhosis (from alcohol abuse in 91%) admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was endoscopically proven to originate from ruptured esophageal varices, were included. After initial control of bleeding, the patients were randomized into the following two groups: group 1 treated with sclerotherapy alone (36 patients) and group 2 treated with sclerotherapy plus propranolol (39 patients). They were followed up to variceal obliteration. In group 2, 7 patients rebled as compared with 14 patients treated with sclerotherapy alone (P less than 0.005). When considering only rebleedings from esophageal varices, 4 patients rebled in group 2 vs. 10 in group 1 (P less than 0.10). The total number of rebleeding episodes was lower in group 2 than in group 1 whether considering all causes (8 vs. 17; P less than 0.07) or variceal rebleedings alone (4 vs. 13; P less than 0.01). Mean total blood requirement per patient was lower in group 2 than in group 1 (1.4 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.79 +/- 6.4 units of blood, respectively; P less than 0.01). Mortality was similar in both groups of patients (14% vs. 13% in groups 1 and 2, respectively, NS).

    "50": "To elucidate mechanisms of adaptation and maladaptation in heart failure, abnormalities of left ventricular function and their relationships to myocardial contractile protein were studied in the Syrian hamster Bio 14.6. Left ventricular and heart weights were both increased in 20-week-old cardiomyopathic hamsters, indicating cardiac hypertrophy as a compensatory mechanism to the disease process of cardiomyopathy. However further increase in the left ventricular weight was not observed in older (40-week-old) cardiomyopathic hamsters. On the other hand left ventricular volume and volume/mass ratio were increased progressively. Correspondingly, V3 type myosin was increased and myosin sliding velocity was decreased. Left ventricular function of cardiomyopathic hamsters evaluated using an isovolumically beating perfused heart preparation was depressed, and this functional impairment was also progressive. Chronic administration of metoprolol, a beta-blocking agent, induced further increase in left ventricular volume and mass without changing left ventricular function and myosin isozyme pattern. Thus in cardiomyopathic hamsters, left ventricular function progressively deteriorates in spite of a variety of adaptive mechanisms, and remodeling occurs.",

Echocardiography was performed at baseline, and after 3 and 12 months of treatment. A significant reduction in left ventricular mass with atenolol was paralleled by a decrease in left ventricular wall thickness and an increase in stroke volume. A similar reduction of left ventricular mass with Moduretic without a change in relative wall thickness and a decrease in stroke volume was observed. Cardiac output decreased in both groups.",

To test whether this criterion is fulfilled by celiprolol, a new beta 1-selective adrenergic blocker drug with peripheral vasodilating activity, we examined the effects of its oral administration on cardiovascular reactivity to laboratory stressors in 18 patients with essential hypertension, according to a placebo-controlled crossover design. In the 12 patients classified as \"responders,\" celiprolol significantly reduced resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05 for both). Compared with placebo, celiprolol induced a blood pressure reduction from 179.4 +/- 16.9/119.5 +/- 12.4 mm Hg to 160.7 +/- 12.6/109.4 +/- 3.1 mm Hg during mental arithmetic; from 200.9 +/- 20.7/139.2 +/- 11.9 mm Hg to 184.1 +/- 16.4/127.6 +/- 12.1 mm Hg during handgrip test; from 212.8 +/- 18.5/126.2 +/- 14.2 mm Hg to 185.9 +/- 18.2/117.1 +/- 15.2 mm Hg during cycle ergometry.

Excretion of total protein, albumin, alpha 1-microglobuline, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) were measured in the 24-h urine by radial immunodiffusion and fluorimetric method, respectively. Before therapy, 8 of 26 patients had microproteinuria (31%), six had microalbuminuria (22%), six had elevated urinary NAG activity (22%), and three had elevated alpha 1-microglobulin excretion (11%). In these subjects anti-hypertensive therapy led to a fall in proteinuria (296 +/- 56 v 127 +/- 116 mg/day, P less than .01), albuminuria (44 +/- 24 v 25 +/- 12 mg/day, P less than .05), and NAG excretion (45 +/- 22 v 28 +/- 5, P less than .05). The higher the pretreatment value, the greater the fall was in proteinuria (r = +0.55, P less than .01), albuminuria (r = 0.80, P less than .001), and NAG excretion (r = 0.60, P less than .01). We did not observe any significant difference in clinical characteristics, blood pressure, or urinary excretion of protein, albumin, or NAG between the two treatment groups, either before or after therapy. Thus, antihypertensive therapy reduced excretion of total protein, albumin, and NAG activity in hypertensive patients with elevated pretreatment values, potentially indicating reversal of early hypertensive nephropathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Interleukin (IL)-4-transgenic mice were used as a model system to study the consequences of low levels of IL-4 expression for the expression of other cytokines examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For this purpose, a plasmid was constructed which contains, in tandem array, 5' and 3' primer sequences specific for the cytokine genes IL-1 to IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), lymphotoxin (LT), interferon (IFN)-gamma and beta-actin. During co-amplification, target and control DNA compete for the primers and the amount of PCR product is proportional to the amount of input DNA. Competitive PCR was performed first to adjust the cDNA to be compared to identical concentrations of beta-actin cDNA and subsequently to determine cytokine mRNA levels from spleen cells of normal and IL-4-transgenic animals. The sensitivity of this approach was demonstrated by the capability to detect a twofold difference in IL-4 mRNA levels between IL-4-transgenic heterozygous and homozygous animals. Upon lipopolysaccharide activation, the IL-4 transgene which is expressed essentially in B lymphocytes was induced approximately 50-fold. Several cytokine mRNA such as those coding for IL-5, IL-6, IFN-gamma and also the IL-4 receptor were found to be up-regulated in IL-4-transgenic mice, whereas IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, TNF and LT mRNA levels did not seemed to be influenced by IL-4. A possible functional significance of the elevated IFN-gamma mRNA was demonstrated by showing that (a) CD23 expression was not increased, and (b) Mac-1+ cells were markedly increased in the spleen of transgenic mice.", 
    "55": "The suppressive effects of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) on the function of pancreatic islets may be related to induction of gene transcription and protein synthesis. Presently, the effects of human recombinant IL-1 beta (rIL-1 beta) on the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the expression of corresponding genes were studied in rat pancreatic islets. Islets that were exposed to rIL-1 beta for 48 h showed a 2.6-fold greater activity of mitochondrial manganese containing SOD (MnSOD) than control islets. The cytosolic copper- and zinc-containing SOD (CuZnSOD) was, however, less affected by rIL-1 beta. Also, brief exposure of the islets to rIL-beta induced an increase in SOD activities. Hence, 12 h after a 1-h exposure of the islets to rIL-1 beta, there was a 1.4-fold increase in the activity of both MnSOD and CuZnSOD. The early induction of SOD by rIL-1 beta was inhibited by an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein and actinomycin-D, which is a blocker of gene transcription. This suggests that the effects of rIL-1 beta on the islet SOD activities are dependent on binding to membrane receptors and activation of gene transcription. Northern blot analysis showed a 4-fold increase in islet MnSOD mRNA content after a 90-min incubation and a 10-fold increase after a 180-min incubation with rIL-1 beta. Thus, the enhanced MnSOD activity in the islets reflects increased gene expression. To evaluate a possible role for free oxygen radicals as mediators of the early action of rIL-1 beta on the pancreatic B-cells, isolated islets were exposed to rIL-1 beta only or to rIL-1 beta plus various free radical scavengers. None of the scavengers, single or in combinations, could counteract the suppressive action of rIL-1 beta on islet insulin secretion. The present data suggest that rIL-1 beta induces increased activity of SOD, in particular MnSOD, in pancreatic islets. This may be due to a direct action of rIL-1 beta that is mediated by an increase in gene transcription.",

However, patients medicated with nifedipine had a significantly higher gingival index (P less than 0.005), gingival overgrowth scores (P less than 0.02) and probing sites greater than 3 mm (P less than 0.005) when compared with the atenolol and control groups. 4 patients in the nifedipine group experienced clinically significant gingival overgrowth which required surgical excision. Gingival changes in the nifedipine patients were not related to drug dosage or plaque scores. It is concluded that nifedipine therapy results in significant gingival changes, an effect which may be mediated by the drug's action on calcium transport.",

In anesthetized dogs, the superior pancreatico-duodenal artery blood flow (SPBF), pancreatic microcirculatory blood flow (PBF) and pancreatic oxygen consumption (PVO2) were determined. Control values for SPBF, PVO2 and PBF averaged 43.3 ml/min, 1.8 ml/min, and 57.5 ml/min/100g of tissue, respectively. Following iv injection of PYY at doses of 200 and 400 pmol/kg the values of SPBF decreased by 12 +/- 1% and 22 +/- 2%, respectively. PVO2 was reduced by those doses of PYY by 9 +/- 1 and 17 +/- 3%, respectively. PBF was also reduced by 16 +/- 2 and 34 +/- 2%, respectively after those doses of PYY. Pretreatment with phentolamine reversed the blood flow and PVO2 responses to PYY because SPBF, PVO2 and PBF were significantly increased above the control level. However, after additional pretreatment with propranolol the pancreatic vascular and metabolic responses to PYY were abolished. The above pancreatic responses to PYY were also significantly reduced after acute adrenalectomy. The experimental data indicate that adrenergic pathway is involved in the mechanism of action of PYY on the pancreatic circulation.", 
    "64": "Fourteen days of treatment with 20 mg/kg/day carbamazepine (CBZ) reduced the immobility time in the behavioral \"despair\" test in rats. Two blockers of dopaminergic receptors: haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg) and sulpiride (100 mg/kg) antagonized the reduction of immobility caused by CBZ. The anti-immobility effect of CBZ was also counteracted by clonidine (0.1 mg/kg) an agonist of presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptors and propranolol (5 mg/kg) beta-adrenolytic drug.", 
    "65": "The pharmacokinetics of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker nadolol was studied in 30 patients suffering from mild hypertension given a single 80 mg dose of the drug. It has been shown that distribution of the pharmacokinetic parameters in this sample can be assumed normal. Their averages are similar to the reported data on healthy subjects. The mean retention time of nadolol in the body was estimated for the first time. The absorption of the drug was shown to be slow, which together with a low degree of bioavailability, may be associated with its low lipophility. A close correlation was demonstrated between the half-life and the mean absorption time estimates computed from blood serum and nadolol excretion with urine. The conclusion is made that glomerular filtration plays the key role in the drug elimination.", 
    "66": "Transcoronary ablation of atrioventricular conduction by dehydrated alcohol was attempted in one patient with refractory ectopic atrial tachycardia. Ethanol (1.5 ml) was delivered after selective catheterization of the atrioventricular nodal artery in a patient in whom the artery could be identified by cineangiography. The mean creatine kinase (MB fraction) at four hour to six hour after ablation was 40 U. No electrocardiographic QRS changes was seen. The procedure was successful. The patient is asymptomatic 3 months after procedure. Transcoronary alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction should be considered in patients in whom electrical techniques have been unsuccessful.", 
    "67": "Guan-fu base A (GFA) is a terpenoid alkaloid isolated from the tuber of Aconitum coreanum in this institute. GFA exhibited anti-arrhythmic effects in various experimental arrhythmia animal models, and bradycardic actions. In this paper, the hemodynamic action of GFA was investigated. GFA 20 mg.kg-1 iv decreased in heart rate from 420 +/- 51 to 305 +/- 60 bpm (P less than 0.05). The changes of SBP, DBP, LVSP, +/- dP/dtmax, and LVEDP were much smaller or insignificant. GFA (1, 3, 10, 30, 60 mg.kg-1 cumulative iv) increased the heart periods (HP) and QT-intervals in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by a small increase in PQ-interval, but did not affect QRS complex. The increase in HP from 138 +/- 11 to 321 +/- 48 ms (P less than 0.01) was mainly due to a prolongation of the diastolic period from 22 +/- 12 ms to 156 +/- 46 ms (P less than 0.01). The triple product of HR x LVET x SBP was also decreased with every dose of GFA. This hemodynamic profile suggests that the bradycardic action of GFA can reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and improve myocardial blood supply, which may be of use in certain cardiac patients.", 
    "68": "Sleep and waking in rats were studied for 8 h following administration of a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (zimeldine), a putative 5-HT1A antagonist (L(-)-alprenolol hydrogene tartrate monohydrate [(-)-alprenolol]) and a combination of (-)-alprenolol and zimeldine. Consistent with earlier findings, zimeldine gave a biphasic effect on sleep and waking. Waking was increased during the first 3 h, followed by a small decrease. Deep slow-wave sleep (SWS-2) showed the opposite trend. An initial decrease in SWS-2 was followed by an increase after around 3 h. Rapid eye movement sleep was markedly suppressed and latencies to sleep increased after zimeldine. (-)-Alprenolol had no effects on the different sleep and waking stages or latencies to sleep. The 5-HT1A antagonist also failed to modify the effects of zimeldine administration. The behavioral syndrome induced by a selective 5-HT1A agonist [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)] was clearly antagonized by administration of (-)-alprenolol, indicating that (-)-alprenolol was an efficient 5-HT1A blocker. The data indicate that the sleep-waking effects of zimeldine cannot easily be explained by stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors.", 
    "69": "The effect of two beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, salbutamol (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) and broxaterol (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), on airway microvascular leakage induced by vagal stimulation was studied in anaesthetised guinea pigs. Airway microvascular leakage was measured by Evans blue extravasation. Broxaterol, but not salbutamol, inhibited Evans blue dye extravasation at all airway levels, an effect prevented by pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg). Neither of the beta 2-agonists had any effect on substance P-induced Evans blue dye extravasation. Broxaterol inhibits the prejunctional release of tachykinins from airway sensory nerves by stimulation of beta-receptors. The mechanism by which beta-adrenoceptor agonists prevent airway microvascular leakage deserves further study.", 
    "70": "Atrial arrhythmias occur frequently in the setting of increased atrial size and pressure. This may result from contraction-excitation feedback. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of alterations in atrial pressure, induced by varying the atrioventricular (AV) interval, on atrial refractoriness, and on the frequency of induction of atrial fibrillation. Twenty-seven patients without structural heart disease participated in the study. In each patient the atrial effective (ERP) and absolute refractory period (ARP) were measured during AV pacing at a cycle length of 400 msec and AV intervals of 0, 120, and 160 msec. The ERP was defined as the longest extrastimulus coupling interval that failed to capture with an extrastimulus current strength of twice the stimulation threshold. The ARP was defined in a similar manner with an extrastimulus current strength of 10 mA. The ERP and ARP were determined during continuous pacing using the incremental extrastimulus technique. A subset of patients had the pacing protocol performed during autonomic blockade. As the AV interval was increased from 0 to 160 msec, the peak right atrial pressure decreased from 16 +/- 4 mmHg to 7 +/- 3 mmHg and the mean right atrial pressure decreased from 7 +/- 3 mmHg to 3 +/- 22 mmHg (P less than 0.001). The atrial ERP and ARP did not change with alterations in the AV interval. There was no difference in the frequency of induction of atrial fibrillation. Similar results were obtained during autonomic blockade. These findings suggests that the phenomenon of contraction-excitation feedback may not be of importance in the development of atrial arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease.", 
    "71": "Recurrent syncope in an otherwise healthy child or adolescent is a common anxiety provoking disorder. Vasovagally mediated hypotension and bradycardia are believed common, yet difficult to diagnose, causes of syncope in this age group. Upright tilt table testing has been suggested as a potential method to test for vasovagal episodes. This study evaluated the utility of this technique in the evaluation and management of recurrent syncope in children and adolescents. Thirty patients with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/min given intravenously), in an attempt to produce hypotension, bradycardia, or both. There were 15 males and 15 females, mean age 14 +/- 6 years. Each of the tilt positive patients received therapy with either fluorohydrocortisone, beta blockers, or transdermal scopolamine. Syncope occurred in six patients (20%) during the base line tilt and in 15 patients (50%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives 70%). All initially positive patients were rendered tilt negative by therapy. Over a mean follow-up period of 20 months, no further episodes have occurred. We conclude that tilt table testing is a useful and effective test in the evaluation of unexplained syncope in childhood.", 
    "72": "Intravenous (i.v.) administration of bromocriptine (150 micrograms/kg) in conscious normotensive rats with chronic spinal cord transection (at T5-T7), pretreated or not with i.v. propranolol (0.5 mg/kg), induced significant decreases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) which were greater and longer lasting than those in intact rats (-15 to -20 as compared with -10 mm Hg) for 8 days after transection. To assess the spinal and/or peripheral origin of this phenomenon, rats were also pretreated with either i.v. (0.3 mg/kg) or intrathecal (i.t.; 93 nmol/rat; at T9-T10) administration of domperidone, a selective dopamine (DA)2 receptor antagonist incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) freely. The increase in hypotension induced by spinal section was suppressed by i.t. but not by i.v. domperidone. In intact rats, bromocriptine elicited an increase in heart rate (HR; approximately 50 beats/min more), which was prevented by i.v. propranolol treatment. In spinal cord-transected rats, however, it had a significant bradycardic effect (approximately 50 beats/min less), which was antagonized by i.t.-administered domperidone. These results suggest that enhancement of the hypotensive effects induced by systemic administration of bromocriptine after a complete thoracic spinal transection is fully mediated by spinal DA2 receptors. This finding may help explain the increased orthostatic hypotension induced by DA receptor agonists in Parkinsonian patients with spinal lesions.", 
    "73": "The circulatory and myocardial effects of cibenzoline were investigated in 78 open-chest rats during and after a 7-min intravenous (i.v.) infusion. Measurements were performed in the intact circulation, and myocardial function was also examined by isovolumic registrations independent of circulatory changes. In the first part of the study, the dose-dependent effects of cibenzoline were investigated (2, 4, and 8 mg/kg vs. NaCl controls). Cibenzoline caused a dose-dependent decrease in heart rate (HR) (-16, -34, -37% vs. preinfusion values), mean aortic blood pressure (AoPm) (-8, -20, -30%), cardiac output (CO) (-6, -29, -39%), and dP/dtmax (+1, -21, -59%). The isovolumic peak left ventricular systolic BP (LVSBP) (-6, -6, -17%) and peak dP/dtmax (-8, -18, -54%) were also reduced. In the second part of the study, we examined the effects of 2 mg cibenzoline/kg after pretreatment with 2 mg DL-sotalol/kg: HR was -22% AoPm was -12%, CO was -29%, dP/dtmax was -40%, isovolumic LV pressure (LVP) was -12%, and peak dP/dtmax was -41%. Cibenzoline caused dose-dependent bradycardia, which cannot be explained by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. The auxotonic and isovolumic measurements indicate that cibenzoline possesses a dose-dependent negative inotropic effect: 2 mg cibenzoline/kg caused only a slight decrease in myocardial performance, but this effect was aggravated after pretreatment with DL-sotalol. Cibenzoline also increased peripheral resistance. The observed combination of negative inotropism and vasoconstriction caused by cibenzoline should be taken into consideration especially in patients with reduced LV function. This is of particular importance if cibenzoline is combined with DL-sotalol.", 
    "74": "1. The effects of the estrogens estradiol (E2, 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-5) M) and diethylstilbestrol (DES, 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-6) M) on tonic contractions of the rat uterus induced by KCl and CaCl2 have been studied. 2. E2 and DES relaxed, in a dose-dependent way, the tonic contraction induced by KCl (60 mM) (IC50: 5.16 +/- 1.49 x 10(-6) and 4.51 +/- 0.03 x 10(-7) M); the tonic contraction induced by CaCl2 (3 mM) in the rat uterus incubated in depolarizing Krebs (127 mM of K+) have also been relaxed (IC50: 8.6 +/- 0.03 x 10(-7) and 2.56 +/- 0.07 x 10 M) by both drugs. 3. The CaCl2 (0.1 to 10 mM) counteracted the relaxing effect of E2 and DES, respectively, up to 28.13 +/- 10.2% and 34.71 +/- 11.5%, on KCl-induced contractions, and up to 126.36 +/- 19.35% and 95.8 +/- 16.3% on CaCl2-induced contractions. 4. Bay K 8644 (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) reversed the relaxing effect of E2 and DES, respectively, up to 42.49 +/- 2.28% and 43.31 +/- 3.59% on KCl-induced contractions, and up to 21.73 +/- 4.16% and 75.97 +/- 9.63% on CaCl2-induced contractions. 5. Propranolol (10(-6) M) did not modify the relaxing effect of E2 or DES on CaCl2-induced contractions.", 
    "75": "Both haemodynamic and metabolic variables have been shown to be related to the fibre composition and capillary density of skeletal muscle in man. In the present study, the change of several metabolic variables during beta-blockade was investigated and related to muscle fibre composition and capillary density in 28 men with essential hypertension. They had been given atenolol (50 mg/day) or metoprolol (200 mg/day) or propranolol (160 mg/day) for 4-12 months. Serum triglycerides increased during treatment and individual changes were significantly inversely correlated with capillary density. Insulin concentrations in the fasting state and at the end of an i.v. glucose tolerance test were significantly higher during beta-blockade, and individual changes were inversely correlated with capillary density. Furthermore, body weight increased and heart rate decreased, changes that were also correlated with capillary density. It is concluded that many of the previously but poorly understood large interindividual differences in response to beta-blocker treatment may be explained by the degree of development of the capillary net in muscle tissue. Obesity, physical training as well as genetic factors are known determinants of capillary density.", 
    "76": "Beta-blocker eyedrops used on asthmatic patients are known to enhance asthma which is, as chronic bronchitis, an obstructive disease of the lung, and an authentic bronchoconstriction is always possible. A single blind parallel trial in 3 groups of 10 patients with grade II and III chronic bronchitis, was conducted to evaluate the cardiovascular and bronchial tolerance of 3 beta-blocker eyedrops: timolol, betaxolol and carteolol compared to placebo. The following parameters were measured during a 90 minutes period: heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, forced expiratory volume in one second, vital capacity. It appeared that only heart rate lowers significantly under the influence of the beta-blocker eyedrop, the other parameters did not change and no difference was noticed between the three eyedrops. However, comparison of individual values showed a significant decrease of forced expiratory volume in one second in certain subjects and this, although betaxolol is a beta 1 selective beta-blocker. Caution should be taken each time beta-blocker eyedrops are prescribed for glaucoma to patients with chronic bronchitis.", 
    "77": "The hypotensive efficacies of timolol, vistagan, and betoptic were studied in three groups of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, matched for the clinical diagnosis, somatic condition, and number of patients. The hypotensive activity of timolol was found superior to that of vistagan or betoptic, but its administration was associated with tachiphylaxia, that is an essential disadvantage of the drug. The advantage of vistagan and betoptic is the possibility of their administration to cardiopulmonary patients with contraindications against timolol therapy.", 
    "78": "The pharmacological properties of facilitatory presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors were characterized using three kinds of beta-agonists and antagonists in superfused strips from young Sprague-Dawley rats, loaded with [3H]noradrenaline. Isoproterenol (10(-9) M to 10(-7) M) concentration-dependently facilitated [3H] release evoked by transmural field stimulation at 5 Hz. Salbutamol (10(-8) M and 10(-7) M) and prenalterol (10(-8) M to 10(-6) M) also facilitated the stimulation-evoked [3H] release. Pretreatment with ICI 118,551 (10(-6) M) completely antagonized the concentration-facilitation curve for isoproterenol (10(-9) M to 10(-7) M). Atenolol (10(-6) M) antagonized only the isoproterenol (10(-9) M)-induced facilitation. dl-Betaxolol (10(-6) M) antagonized the isoproterenol (10(-9) M and 10(-8) M)-induced facilitation and the antagonistic action for isoproterenol (10(-8) M) was more marked than that of atenolol, whereas the same concentration of d-betaxolol produced no antagonism. Thus, presynaptic beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors coexist on noradrenergic neurons innervating splenic strips of young rats. Betaxolol is a useful tool to characterize presynaptic beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "79": "In the last few years several Authors reported positive results using beta-blocking therapy in chronic heart failure. They also observed a group of patients who did not improve after this treatment. The aim of our study was comparing hemodynamic, neurohumoral and heart rate responses to beta-blockers in 2 groups of patients: Group A, patients who improved and Group B, patients who did not improve their clinical conditions after beta-blockade. We studied 26 patients with chronic heart failure of different origin: coronary artery disease and idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy. They were treated with atenolol 50 mg/die for at least 1 year. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A including patients who increased the exercise time and the peak VO2 (> or = 2 ml/min/kg) and Group B, patients who did not increase exercise time and peak VO2 during beta-blockers. In Group A patients we observed a correlation between heart rate and end-diastolic volume by scintigraphy. We did not observe this correlation in Group B patients. The ejection fraction, evaluated by scintigraphy, significantly increased in Group A, while in Group B did not change. In both groups of patients we observed that plasmatic norepinephrine decreased significantly. In our opinion, this reduction is not due to an amelioration of organ clearance, because it was observed even in patients who did not show an increase of cardiac index and of ejection fraction. We suggest that the decrease of plasmatic norepinephrine might be the effect of beta-blockade and that it is not related to clinical response after treatment.", 
    "80": "The relative potency in inhibiting nicotine-induced relaxation of the bovine retractor penis muscle (BRP) was estimated for the racemates of seven beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, both of the optical isomers of propranolol, and lidocaine. The order of potency of the drugs studied was (+)-propranolol greater than (-)-propranolol greater than propranolol greater than alprenolol greater than metoprolol greater than lidocaine greater than acebutolol greater than pindolol greater than sotalol greater than atenolol. It is concluded that the inhibition of the relaxation was not due to blockade of beta-adrenoceptors but to the nonspecific effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. It is also concluded that the neurotransmitter(s) which was (were) released from the non-adrenergic non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves in the BRP did not relax the muscle by activating the beta-adrenoceptors. It is suggested that the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists inhibited the release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter(s) by a mechanism which is significantly correlated to their lipophilicity.", 
    "81": "Out of a total of 2272 diurnal curves (DC) of intraocular pressure (IOP) obtained from 1178 patients 690 first curves of the right eye of all patients were analysed. For each DC there were 4-6 IOP readings taken between 8 am and 6.30 pm of the same day. The patients' diagnosis, age, sex, type of IOP lowering medication, diabetes, and the calendar month of the year were recorded. In 40% of cases the highest IOP was found at the earliest morning measurement with some 65% of peaks occurring before noon. The lowest IOP measurement showed no specific predilection for any particular time of the day. These findings were true for all diagnosis groups. The mean range of IOP fluctuation during the DC was 5.0 mm Hg in normals, 5.8 mm Hg in patients with open angle glaucoma (OAG), and 6.8 mm Hg in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT). Patients treated with timolol had a lower mean IOP fluctuation range than those on other types of IOP lowering treatment. No association was found between all other parameters examined and the diurnal IOP distribution.", 
    "82": "Electrical instability of the heart after myocardial infarction threatens surviving patients with sudden death from a severe ventricular arrhythmia. These arrhythmic complications are usually the result of several factors: an arrhythmogenic substrate corresponding to the ischaemic myocardium, a trigger factor (usually a ventricular extrasystole) and other predisposing factors (autonomic nervous system, electrolyte imbalance, activation of the renin-angiotensin system). Risk stratification of electrical instability combines noninvasive (Holter, exercise testing, signal averaged electrocardiography, study of the variability of the heart rate, radionuclide or echocardiographic evaluation of the left ventricular ejection fraction) and invasive investigations (coronary angiography and even programmed ventricular stimulation). The presence of late ventricular potentials, a low ejection fraction and/or a ventricular arrhythmia on Holter monitoring identifies a high risk subgroup. Although the assessment of electrical instability is better than it used to be, pharmacological prevention remains disappointing. Class I antiarrhythmics are ineffective or dangerous. The efficacy of Class III antiarrhythmics is uncertain and only the betablockers seem to have any beneficial effects on this post-infarction electrical instability.", 
    "83": "Myocardial infarction is responsible for 25,000 deaths per year in France and is a real problem of public health. The management of patients victims of this condition is an important feature of medical practice. Thrombolytic therapy has resulted in significant improvements in the reduction of the size of the infarct, in the conservation of left ventricular function and in the reduction of mortality. Treatment of the acute phase of myocardial infarction, especially when there are contra-indications to thrombolysis, comprises other approaches, some of which are old, which are reviewed in the light of the results of the latest large scale therapeutic trials.", 
    "84": "Incessant, rapid, supraventricular tachycardia may be complicated by cardiac failure with ventricular dilatation and hypokinetic wall motion on echocardiography: so-called tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis is simple when the cardiac rhythm is not sinus rhythm. The authors report the cases of 4 children aged 7 months to 12 years, referred for diagnosis and treatment of apparently primary cardiomyopathy. The findings of spontaneous or vagally-induced atrioventricular conduction defects, a permanently rapid atrial rhythm though influenced by 24 hour variations, or periodic abnormal rate increases, suggested myocardial dysfunction due to an ectopic atrial tachycardia. This was an essential step in management as the control of the tachycardia by amiodarone or betablocker therapy resulted in regression of symptoms and normalisation of left ventricular function. However, some atrial tachycardias are very resistant to medical treatment and, in such cases, there should be no hesitation in using more radical approaches, surgery or ablation, even and especially in patients with severe cardiac failure. In conclusion, apparently primary dilated cardiomyopathy in children may be due to chronic atrial arrhythmia and it is essential to perform at least Holter monitoring in order not to miss this diagnosis.", 
    "85": "1. Cardiac performance and vascular resistance was studied in seven healthy men by radionuclide cardiography and venous plethysmography before and after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine and after combined alpha-adrenoceptor, beta-adrenoceptor (propranolol) and parasympathetic (atropine) blockade. 2. During alpha-adrenoceptor blockade heart rate and cardiac output increased considerably and left ventricular ejection fraction increased because of increased contractility. Systemic vascular resistance fell both during alpha-adrenoceptor blockade alone and during combined blockade. The increase in calf blood flow was of the same magnitude after combined blockade and after alpha-adrenoceptor blockade alone, and was considerably higher than the fall in systemic vascular resistance. Plasma catecholamine concentrations increased after phentolamine, but the changes were blunted when propranolol and atropine were added. 3. These results indicate that peripheral vasoconstriction especially that exerted by alpha-adrenoceptor nervous tone in skeletal muscle restricts left ventricular emptying of the intact heart. During pharmacologic blockade of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system at rest the chronotropic state is augmented, whereas preload and inotropy are unaffected.", 
    "86": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents constitute first-line therapy for hypertension in many countries of the world. Comparative trials have been extensive in duration and have included large numbers of patients. Still, the desired cardioprotective effect of beta blockers has yet to be established. Their antiatherosclerotic effect has been noted in several animal experiments. Confirming evidence is needed before the clinical relevance of this effect can be evaluated, but these studies point to a potential therapeutic effect that may be immensely important in the future. Beta blockers can reverse left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, but it remains to be shown that regression of left ventricular hypertrophy will reduce the associated risks."
