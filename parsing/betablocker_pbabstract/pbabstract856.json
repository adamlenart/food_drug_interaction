    "0": "The effects of mescaline upon single cortical neurones were studied, using the microiontophoretic technique. Mescaline elicited excitatory and depressant responses similar to those evoked by noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HI). The responses to NA and mescaline were usually in the same direction, the neurone being either excited by both drugs or depressed by both drugs. The correlation between the effects of mescaline and 5-HT, however, was less consistent. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent MJ-1999 and the 5-HT antagonist methysergide were both effective in antagonizing mescaline responses.", 
    "1": "To clarify the mode of action of phenoxybenzamine, an alpha adrenergic blocking agent, its effects upon plasma LH levels in ovariectomized rats and upon the ovulatory LH surge expected between 1400 and 1600, the critical period, on the day of proestrus in normal rats were studied. A single injection of phenoxybenzamine, 20 mg/kg, given at 1300 on the day of proestrus bokced ovulation (1 out of 7 ovulating), while plasma LH did not differ from controls between 1500 and 1600. An additional injection of 20 iu HCG at 1500 prevented the ovulation block (83% ovulating). A single phenoxybenzamine injection at 1700 failed to prevent ovulation (5 out of 7 ovulating). The beta adrenergic blocking agents, propanolol and MJ 1999, did not affect ovulation. Treatment with phenoxybenzamine for 2 days, 20mg/kg/day, for 8 days, 10mg/kg/day, were did not prevent the rise causing a reduction in blood flow through the ovary rather than acting as a neurogenic stimulus in the hypothalamus.", 
    "2": "Tubal motility during the menstrual cycle was measured in women by means of an indwelling polyvinyl catheter. During all phases of the cycle, there were episodes of tubal motility at regular intervals. These episodes were more frequent during menstruation but the intensity and duration were greater during the proliferative phase. During the luteal phase the intensity and duration of the outburst were depressed. The episodes of motor activity were asynchronous between the 2 tubes and between different portions of the same tube. Activity in the rabbit was similar to that of the human and was found in the isthmic and ampullar portions of the tube but not in the infundibulum. Intravenous administration of epinephrine or norepinephrine increased motility. Alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine mesylate and phenoxybenzamine suppressed spontaneous outbursts in the rabbit. The tubes were sensitive to oxytocin but almost insensitive to vasopressin. Suction of the breast increased tubal motility.", 
    "3": "1. DL-1-(2-acetyl-4-n-butyramidophenoxy)-2-hydroxy-3-isopropylaminopropane hydrochloride (M & B 17803A) was given to four healthy volunteers in single oral doses of up to 300 mg. There were no subjective effects and no significant alterations in the heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the seated position or in the forced expiratory volume or in the electrocardiogram within 6 h of the dose. There were no abnormalities in haematological tests and estimations of the serum glutamyloxaloacetic transaminase.2. Oral doses of both M & B 17803A and propranolol inhibited the increase in heart rate which occurs on tilting from the supine to the 80 degrees head up position. The results suggest that the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by M & B 17803A (100 and 300 mg) is comparable to that of propranolol (10 and 40 mg) respectively. Propranolol is 7.5-10.0 times as potent as M & B 17803A when compared by this method. There were no significant changes in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure after any of the treatments, in either of the positions studied.3. M & B 17803A was also effective in inhibiting the increase in heart rate produced by the intravenous infusion of isoprenaline and in two subjects the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade produced by M & B 17803A (300 mg) was comparable to that of propranolol (40 mg). M & B 17803A is a competitive beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent and the duration of the pharmacological activity of both M & B 17803A and propranolol appeared to be very similar as assessed by this method.4. In separate experiments with small oral doses of M & B 17803A no evidence of a selective action on myocardial beta-adrenoceptors was obtained from the study of changes in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure (sphygmomanometric recording).", 
    "4": "1. The effect on rectal temperature of adrenoceptor blocking agents, injected through a cannula chronically implanted into a lateral cerebral ventricle, was examined in unanaesthetized rabbits, cats and rats, kept at room temperature (19-22 degrees C).2. In rabbits, the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine (50 or 100 mug) produced marked hypothermia when injected intraventricularly but not when injected intravenously. In some rabbits as little as 1 mug was effective on intraventricular injection. Phentolamine and ergotamine, the other alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents examined, had a much weaker hypothermic action when injected intraventricularly, whereas the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents propranolol, pronethalol and Trasicor had no effect.3. In rabbits in which the noradrenaline stores of the hypothalamus were depleted by intraventricular injections of reserpine, the hypothermic effect of phenoxybenzamine was abolished and remained abolished for a few days.4. In cats, an intraventricular injection of phenoxybenzamine (200 mug) produced long-lasting hyperthermia, but not in all cats, and only with the first, or the first two or three injections. Injected intraperitoneally, this dose had no effect on temperature. Phentolamine (100 or 200 mug) had a very weak hyperthermic effect and phentolamine (500 mug), a hypothermic effect, but only on intraventricular injection, whereas ergotamine (100 and 200 mug) had a weak hyperthermic effect both on intraventricular and intraperitoneal injection. Propranolol and Trasicor had no effect on temperature when injected intraventricularly.5. In rats, phenoxybenzamine (5 or 20 mug) produced long-lasting hypothermia on intraventricular injection.6. Some of the temperature effects produced by intraventricular injections of the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents are explained on the assumption that they prevent the effect on temperature produced by a continuous release of noradrenaline from adrenergic neurones innervating the anterior hypothalamus.", 
    "5": "1. Amphetamine sulphate (5 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally, reduces the concentration of glycogen in the mouse brain by 25-30% after 30 minutes.2. The effect of several receptor blocking drugs on the amphetamine-induced cerebral glycogenolysis was studied.3. DL-Propranolol (0.25 mg/kg) and pronethalol (10 mg/kg) antagonized the depletion of brain glycogen by amphetamine.4. Phentolamine, methysergide, atropine and mepyramine failed to antagonize the amphetamine-induced glycogenolysis.5. D-Propranolol, chlorpromazine and phenoxybenzamine antagonized the glycogenolytic effect of amphetamine only when administered in sedative doses.6. It is concluded that amphetamine-induced glycogenolysis in the mouse brain may be mediated through a beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "6": "1. The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of some alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulants and antagonists on the body temperature of rabbits were investigated.2. Noradrenaline produced a dose dependent rise in body temperature. Other catecholamines were less active.3. The noradrenaline response was blocked by alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents while beta-adrenoceptor antagonists had no effect.4. alpha-Methyl-noradrenaline and metaraminol had some hyperthermic effect, but significantly reduced the response of noradrenaline.5. The possible presence of alpha-adrenoceptors in the central thermoregulatory mechanisms is suggested."
