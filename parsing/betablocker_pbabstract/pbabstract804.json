The stated differences being due mainly to the power of their action. These compounds possess also spasmolytic and locally anaesthetic action of various degrees. Only ROM-131 has antihistamine action.", 
    "1": "1. In healthy subjects the plasma concentration of unchanged drug, heart rate response to excerise and attenuation of isoprenaline tachycardia were maximal at one hour after ingestion of a range of doses of propranolol, oxprenolol, practolol, tolamolol, atenolol and metoprolol. 2. There was a within-drug relationship between plasma concentration of unchanged drug and the attenuation of exercise and iosprenaline tachycardia. There was no similar between-drug relationship. 3. There was a similar exponential relationship between oral dose and reduction of exercise tachycardia for all six drugs. 4. The linear relationship between oral dose and antagonism of infused isoprenaline was significantly greater for oxprenolol and propranolol than for the other four drugs. 5. \"Cardioselective\" activity was the only ancillary pharmacological property which differentiated the activity of these drugs in normal subjects.", 
    "2": "Microsurgical and microscopic methods were employed in guinea pigs to expose, observe, and measure response characteristics of cerebral cortical pial microvessels and microcirculation to traumatic and nontraumatic experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bleeding produced by vascular micropuncture was associated with a 44.3% arteriolar constriction. Topical application of homologous blood alone produced a 33.2% vasoconstriction. Observed microcirculatory flow characteristics subsequent to such microvascular changes were consistent with those known to be associated with cerebral cortical infarction. These changes could be prevented or reversed by topical application of the alpha adrenergic blocker, phenoxybenzamine. Topical pretreatment with the beta adrenergic blocker, propranolol, prevented blood-induced spasm, but did not reverse such spasm once it had been established. A chemo-mechanical mechanism is suggested as underlying the vasoconstriction association with rupture of pial microvessels. It is thought that consideration of such microvascular characteristics, in conjunction with those known to be associated with larger intracranial vessels, adds to current knowledge of the pathophysiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage and may be extrapolated to bear future clinical import.", 
    "3": "Spin-labeled analogs of biotin (vitamin H), hexamethonium, decamethonium, dichlorisoproterenol, propranolol, and primaquine containing the nitroxide free radical have been synthesized and tested for biological activity. The four spin-labeled analogs of biotin, 4-biotinamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (IV), 3-biotinamido-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (V), 3-biotinamidomethyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxy (VI), and 4-(biotinylglycyl)amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (VII), all interacted with avidin, a specific biotin binding protein found in raw egg white, at the same sites as did biotin itself. An unsymmetrical decamethonium spin label (XVIII) in which one of the quaternary methyl groups had been replaced by the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) moiety was 13 times more potent as an inhibitor of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase than the parent drug. The symmetrical decamethonium (XVI) and hexamethonium (XIV) spin labels were 18 and 1.8 times as active as decamethonium in the same assay system. The substitution of the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) group for the isopropyl groups of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs dichlorisoproterenol and propranolol, to give spin labels XXI and XXII, caused a 45 and 54% reduction, respectively, in the ability of these compounds to inhibit the isoproterenol-stimulated activity of rat fat cell membranes. Finally, modification of primaquine by the introduction of the 4-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) substituent into the amino group of the butyl side chain completely abolished the ability of the drug to bind to nuclei acids. These results suggest that the incorporation of the nitroxide group into drug molecules may be a useful approach to the synthesis of more specific spin labels for biological systems, such as egg white avidin, acetylcholinesterase, and the beta-adrenergic receptor.", 
    "4": "Human keratinocytes grown in vitro as epithelial outgrowths or as organ cultures maintain many of their normal functions such as proliferation and keratinization. These in vitro systems have been used to analyze the effect of various agents on proliferation. All adenine nucleotides, including dibutyryl cyclic AMP, blocked mitosis in the G2 part of the cell cycle at concentrations of 1 times 10(-4) M. Some nonadenine nucleotides also showed this effect, but only at higher concentrations, an indication that the effect was specific for adenine nucleotides. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline both depressed the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. Catecholamines such as isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were also potent inhibitors of mitosis (G2 block) at concentrations of 1 times 10(-8) to 1 times 10(-10) M. The fact that the effect could be blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol, suggests the existence of specific membrane receptor sites. However, dichloroisoproterenol, another beta blocker, had distinct inhibitory properties in itself and thus indicated that the mechanism of action of catecholamines in human keratinocytes is complex and may involve more than binding to specific receptor sites. Histamine at a concentration of 2 times 10(-6) M was also a strong mitotic inhibitor. This finding is directly opposed to that in rat skin where mitosis is stimulated. Imidazole acetate, a histamine breakdown product, was found to be a striking mitotic stimulator in organ culture. A water-extractable protein (chalone) from human skin also caused a block in G2. Most of the substances tested occur naturally in the cell or organism and their ability to stimulate or depress proliferation in vitro suggests that they play a regulatory role in vivo.", 
    "5": "1. Three 3-methanesulphonamido, 4-hydroxy ring substituted phenylethanolamines with N-isopropyl (soterenol), N-t-butyl (MJ7999-1) and N-(1-phenyl-t-butyl)(MJ9184-1) amine substituents have been compared with ()-isoprenaline for their ability to produce beta-receptor mediated reductions in serotonin-induced increases in pulmonary resistance, decreases in soleus muscle contractility, and increases in heart rate in anaesthetized cats. For each parameter, the dose of a compound required to produce 50% of its maximal response (ED50) was calculated. 2. For all three parameters ()-isoprenaline was the most potent of the compounds studied, and the rank order of potency of the methanesulphonanilides was MJ9184-1 (N-(1-phenyl-t-butyl))congruent to MJ7999-1 (N-t-butyl) greater than soterenol (N-isopropyl). 3. For each individual drug, molar dose-ratios [drug:()-isoprenaline] were calculated. Ratios for the effects of the compounds on the soleus muscle and in the bronchi were similar. With each compound higher dose-ratios were found in the heart. The rank order for relative beta2-selectivity was soterenol (N-isopropyl) greater than MJ7999-1 (N-t-butyl) congruent to MJ9184-1 (N-(1-phenyl-t-butyl)).", 
    "6": "The effect of sympathetic alpha-receptor coronary vasoconstriction on myocardial oxygen tension was studied in open- and closed-chest, chloralose-anesthetized dogs. Blood oxygen tension in the coronary sinus and blood flow in the circumflex coronary artery were continuously measured in a three-part experiment. With stimulation of the left stellate ganglion (15 Hz, 3 msec, 4-7 v, 90-second train) under vagotomy control conditions (part 1), heart rate, blood pressure, and coronary blood flow increased, but coronary sinus oxygen tension decreased from 19 mm Hg to 15 mm Hg. In part 2, beta-receptor blockade with propranolol (2.0 mg/kg. iv) in the same dogs blunted the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of sympathetic stimulation; coronary alpha-receptor vasoconstriction was unmasked, and coronary sinus blood oxygen tension fell from 17 mm Hg to 11 mm Hg. Since increases in oxygen metabolism were blunted, it appeared that the decrease in coronary sinus oxygen tension was caused by alpha-receptor coronary artery vasoconstriction. This hypothesis was tested in part 3 by the addition of alpha-receptor blockade with Dibozane (3.0 mg/kg, iv). Sympathetic stimulation no longer resulted in a change in either coronary vascular resistance or coronary sinus oxygen tension. These results indicate that the fall in oxygen tension during beta-receptor blockade in part 2 was due to alpha-receptor coronary vasoconstriction. Thus, myocardial oxygen tension may be regulated by coronary sympathetic vasomotion as well as by myocardial oxygen metabolism and local vascular control mechanisms.", 
    "7": "Effects of catecholamines on cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and ion fluxes were examined in isolated rabbit ileal mucosa. The base-line cAMP level was unaffected by epinephrine (Epi), norepinephrine (Norepi), and isoproterenol. The theophylline-augmented cAMP level was decreased slightly be Epi in one series of experiments but not in another. Propranolol did not enhance this effect. The increase in cAMP level produced by cholera toxin was almost completely reversed by addition of Epi or Norepi. This reversal was prevented by phenoxybenzamine. Epi also partially reversed the increase in cAMP level produced by prostaglandin E1. Effects of Epi on ion fluxes were determined following addition of secretagogues. Epi significantly decreased theophylline-induced but not cAMP or cholera toxin-induced Cl secretion. A decrease in short-circuit current was nonetheless observed in the latter two instances. The observed discrepancies between alpha-adrenergic effects on cAMP levels and ion fluxes suggest the following possibilities: 1) ion transport-related cAMP is only a small fraction of total mucosal cAMP; 2) cAMP-induced active ion secretion is only slowly reversible, or 3) effects of alpha-adrenergic stimuli on ion transport are not due to inhibition of cAMP accumulation.", 
    "8": "The direct effects of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (D-cAMP) on renal blood flow were studied in dogs under renal perfusion with constant pressure. Cyclic AMP caused a marked phasic decrease in renal blood flow in doses more than 1 mg, while D-cAMP produced a slight increase in that in doses more than 10 mg. The vasoconstrictive effect of cAMP was not blocked by the pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine, but was markedly depressed during the infusion of aminophylline. On the other hand, the vasodilative effect of D-cAMP was not affected either by the pretreatment with propranolol or during the infusion of aminophylline. These findings indicate that cAMP and D-cAMP have an opposite direct effect on the renal artery, independently of the adrenergic receptors. However, there may be a possibility that cAMP produces its vasoconstrictive effect on the renal artery partly through the action of its metabolites.", 
    "9": "1 N-2-O-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (db cyclic AMP), adrenaline and aminophylline produce a potentiation of the tension developed (Td) and the maximum rate of rise of tension (dT/dt max) in the rat isolated diaphragm during indirect electrical stimulation. Aminophylline and db cyclic AMP also produce the same effect during direct stimulation. 2 Propranolol produced a depression of the action of adrenaline on Td and dT/dt max during indirect stimulation of the diaphragm. On the other hand, the potentiating actions of db cyclic AMP and of aminophylline on Td and dT/dt max during indirect stimulation were unaffected by propranolol. 3 The results support the idea that cyclic AMP may be involved not only in regulating the processes associated with synthesis, mobilization and storage of transmitter in the motor nerve terminal, but also in modifying some metabolic processes which regulate the function of the contractile elements.", 
    "10": "Alterations in myocardial and plasma levels of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic phosphate (cyclic AMP) were studied following clamping of the aorta or coronary artery occlusion in 30 dogs. Plasma cyclic APM levels increased markedly after thoracotomy but returned to control levels two hours later. Complete arrest of aortic flow (clamping) induced a significant early increase in the myocardial cyclic AMP levels of all animals studied. No increase was noted following pretreatment with propranolol or sham-occlusion. After localized coronary occlusion, only modest and insignificant changes occurred in plasma cyclic AMP levels in anesthetized animals and also in conscious dogs. The present study suggests that adrenergically mediated changes in tissue cyclic AMP content are an early manifestation of both generalized and local myocardial ischemia, while the plasma cyclic AMP level is a relatively insensitive indicator of small coronary occlusions.", 
    "11": "1. Prostaglandin E1 (0.4 ml/kg, i.p.) significantly potentiated the antinociceptive action of morphine in albino rats. 2. This potentiation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with reserpine, p-chlorophenylalanine or methysergide but not by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, phentolamine or propranolol. 3. The results suggest that the potentiation of morphine by prostaglandin E1 is mediated by serotonin, since it is inhibited by pharmacological agents known to reduce central turnover of serotonin receptors.", 
    "12": "A very rare case of a sustained fetal ventricular arrythmia in the form of bigeminy, trigeminy, and quadrigeminy during labor is described. The rhythm distrubance failed to respond to sedatives and narcotics but was successfuly reverted to sinus rhythm following the administration of intravenous propranolol to the mother. The significance and possible mechanism of the arrhythmia is discussed.", 
    "13": "The slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) belongs to a group of substances which produce a slow progressive and sustained contraction of some smooth muscles. It is released by the interaction of the antigen with certain antibodies; in humans through the interaction with the IgE or reagine. The SRS-A is a heat-labile sustance, chemically unstable, of an acid character, with a low molecular weight. It is not destroyed by the action of proteolytic enzymes. Its molecular structure has not yet been elucidated. It is not found accumulated in the cells but synthesized and released by some white cells mainly by sensitized mast cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes after challenging with the specific antigen. The SRS-A is a powerful pharmacodynamic agent, it produces contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle in doses of nanograms. It probably plays a predominant role in the physiopathology of asthma. The chain of chemical reactions elicited by antigen-antibody interaction does not end with the release of SRS-A and the other mediators (histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, ECF-A), on the contrary, these mediators especially SRS-A induce the release of prostaglandins of type E (PGE1 and PGE2) which produce bronchodilatation and inhibit the release of SRS-A itself, perhaps being a selfregulating mechanism. The PGF2a, on the other hand, produces bronchoconstriction. The release of SRS-A is also inhibited by the action of diethyl-carbamazine and especially by sodium chromoglicate and compound AH-7725. From the biochemical point of view it is found that the antigen Igells, a serine esterase, initiating several chemical reactions whose consequence is a decrease in the cAMP concentration. This reduction in the cAMP intracellular level is followed by synthesis and excretion of the SRS-A as well as by the aggregation of the microtubules and excretion of the stored histamine. The PGE (1 and 2) acting on one type of membrane receptor and the beta-agonist catecholamines on another produce a common phenomenon: the activation of the adenylcyclase whcih produces the increase of the concentration of cAMP and inhibits the release of mediators of the anapylactic reaction. The parasympathetic system through its chemical mediator acethylcholine, by a mechanism in whcih adenycyclase is not involved is also capable of stimulating the release of histamine and SRS-A. Something similar happens with PGF2a. In conclusion, self-regulatory mechansims for the release of mediators of the anaphylactic reactions may exist. The \"perpetuation\" of an asthamtic reaction would signify a failure of these self-regulatory mechanisms due to, for example, to a temporary block of the beta-adrenergic receptors, overstimulation of the alfa-receptors or insufficient production of PGE or a transformation of the PGE in PGF.", 
    "14": "When pathophysiological and pathogenetic aspects of hypertension are taken into consideration with special regard to diabetes mellitus the exhaustion of the \"insulin enhancement\" within the cerebrovisceral functional systems (Baumann) are discussed and the authors enter possible connections of diabetes mellitus to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. After explanation of the diabetogenic and antidiabetogenic pharmacodynamic qualities of the antihypertensive drugs adequate therapeutic recommendations are proposed summarized in a figure. The authors conclude that for the present antihypertensive therapy in diabetics taking into consideration the references reported on there are sufficient possibilities of treatment for all degrees of severity of hypertension. Such preparations as Rausedan, Disotat, Dopegyt appear as particularly suitable; moreover, the beta receptor blockers, Haemiton, Depressan as well as Guanitil and Pargylin prove to be possible or without disadvantage, respectively. Especially when diuretics are described an exact control of the metabolism should be carried out.", 
    "15": "It has been demonstrated that the study of the activity of 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine-desaminase permits to interpret the metabolism of adenosine. Curanthil, Sustac and Intensain influence the adenosine metabolism favouring an elevation of its content. The therapeutic effect of Obsidan is not conditioned by the \"adenosine\" metabolism.", 
    "16": "On the basis of extended personal experience and of the literature data, the authors give recommendations for differentiated rational drug therapy of different stages of ischaemic heart disease. The results of a study of comparative efficacy of 15 coronary-active drugs used in 709 patients with ischaemic heart disease are presented along with their clinical pharmacology, side effects, indications and counterindications. The conclusions were arrived at on the basis of an objective clinical and laboratory study of the effect of the drugs. The methods of evaluation of the drug's efficacy and of the selection of patients for the administration of adequate therapy are described, which permits to use these recommendations for practical purposes. Some problems of the pathogenesis of ischaemic heart disease are discussed in terms of the selection of pathogenetic therapy.", 
    "17": "Adrenaline and isoproterenol elicited nearly maximal relaxation of the colon even in small doses, whereas increase in the doses caused greater relaxation in the duodenum. In the colon, these drugs prevented, to a great extent the contraction induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin but in the duodenum were totally ineffective. Dibenamine and propranolol reduced adrenaline- and isoproterenol-induced relaxation in the duodenum, though propranolol decreased the relaxation caused by isoproterenol. Atropine prevented ACh-induced contraction in both the colon and duodenum in the same way. After 2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide, duodenal contraction caused by ACh or serotonin decreased by over 70%; however, the contraction of the colon was not significantly inhibited. Methysergide had similar effects, but to a lesser degree. In calcium-free bathing fluid without addition of Na2EDTA, ACh and prostaglandin E1 elicited contraction in the colon, but not in the duodenum.", 
    "18": "Adrenaline-induced gastric ulceration was studied in rats. Adrenaline in high doses caused gastric ulcer, which was completely blocked by pretreatment with alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine, dibenamine), but not by pretreatment with propranolol or atropine, nor by vagotomy, hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy. After successive administration of adrenaline, once daily for 7 days, however, no gastric ulcer was observed. Recovery from the ulcerogenic action of adrenaline was seen after 4 weeks withdrawal. Pretreatment with a small dose of adrenaline inhibited the ulcerogenic action of a high dose of adrenaline. Pretreatment with reserpine, pyrogallol or iproniazid inhibited the action of adrenaline. It is concluded that adrenaline has a biphasic effect on gastric ulceration, the ulcerogenic action is due to its alpha-action and antiulcerogenic effect is due to development of tachyphylaxis.", 
    "19": "Hypertensives with normal and increased plasma-renin activity have an increased salivary excretion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) such as can be obtained in normal persons by stimulation of beta-adrenergic fibres. Propanolol, as a beta-receptor blocker, reduces such increased cAMP levels in hypertensives to minimal levels. The results suggest that beta-receptors are stimulated in hypertensives with normal or increased renin activity.", 
    "20": "The rate of occurrence of disturbances of intracardiac conduction in association with adult hypothyroidism is not well known. On the basis of routine study of the electrocardiograms of 42 non-treated patients, disturbances of conduction were found in almost one third. Left anterior hemiblock (6/42) and first degree atrioventricular block (5/42) are the commonest. Bifascicular involvement is rare. Neither a trifascicular lesion nor complete AV dissociation were seen. There was no evident effect of hormone therapy on conduction disturbances. Their prognosis is good but they should perhaps be taken into consideration when the indications for beta-blockers are weighed.", 
    "21": "1. The effect of HgCl2 in concentrations from 1 times 10(-4) to 4 times 10(-3) M on the force of contraction of the guinea-pig papillary muscles was investigated. A rapidly developing negative inotropic effect was found to be interrupted by a transient increase in contractile force. 2. In papillary muscles from reserpine-pretreated animals only the decrease of force of contraction was observed. Thus the positive inotropic effect is due to an indirect sympathomimetic action of HgCl2. 3. Mercuric chloride in concentrations above 1 times 10(-3) M raised the threshold of stimulation in more than half the muscles. 4. HgCl2 shortened the time to peak force (t1) and the relaxation time (t2); in muscles of animals pretreated with reserpine, however, t2 increased above the control value. 5. When exposed to HgCl2 all muscles developed a contracture beginning during the 5th min. 6. The time course of membrane resting potential, overshoot, and duration of action potential gradually decreased under the influence of mercuric chloride. The direct negative inotropic effect had a slightly faster onset than had the changes of the electrical parameters.", 
    "22": "We have found bulbocapnine to be an effective, apparently competitive inhibitor of dopamine depressor responses in the anesthetized, phenoxybenzamine-treated cat. The duration of action of the compound as a dopaminergic antagonist exceeded 3 hrs after an intravenous dose of 8 mg/kg. In the same preparation, however bulbocapnine did not at all inhibit the depressor responses to acetylcholine, histamine and isoproterenol, indicating a selectivity of action. Although administration of a high dose of propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.v.) did not alter the response of the alpha-receptor blocked cat to dopamine, the subsequent infusion of bulbocapnine remained effective. These results suggest that dopamine is acting as a blood pressure depressor agent via a unique receptor mechanism.", 
    "23": "Prostaglandins (Pgs), slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and histamine were released from anaphylactic isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. Pgs were to the greatest part of the F2alpha-type. PgE2 was found in traces only. Neither PgA2, nor the metabolites 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PgF2alpha and 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PgE2 were detected in the perfusates. Isoproterenol reduced the PgF2alpha output significantly. This effect was increased by the addition of theophylline. Propranolol did not reverse the effect of isoproterenol, but in a high concentration (5 mug/ml) reduced the PgF2alpha output for its own. Indomethacin completely abolished the anaphylactic prostaglandin release. The histamine liberation was significantly decreased only by the combination of isoproterenol and theophylline, and also by a high concentration of propranolol (5 mug/ml). In contrast to the Pg release, the anaphylactic SRS-A and histamine liberation was not abolished by indomethacin, but rather increased. The results are discussed in view of the possible role of the released substances in the functional events of cardiac anaphylaxis.", 
    "24": "Carbachol and norepinephrine induce glycogen breakdown in rat submaxillary glands incubated in vitro. These effects are suppressed by specific inhibitors of cholinergic receptors (atropine, a muscarinic blocker) and of adrenergic receptors (propranolol, a beta-blocker and phentolamine, an alpha-blocker). The beta-adrenergic effect seems to be mediated through the adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate system, whereas the alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic effects are dependent of Ca2+ influx into cell. In the two latter systems, it is suggested that a direct activation of phosphorylase b kinase by calcium takes place. These data clearly indicate that glycogenolysis in rat submaxillary glands in vitro can be independently affected by sympathetic and parasympathetic agents via specific receptors.", 
    "25": "Exercise tolerance has been studied by two different methods, heart-rate-controlled exercise and stepwise increased load, in 12 patients with angina pectoris. The response to a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, alprenolol, and an alkyl nitrate derivative, pentaerythritol trinitrate (PETRIN) was studied by the two methods after double-blind administration of the drugs. Rating scales were used to quantitate the degree of dyspnoea, angina pectoris and tiredness in the legs. After PETRIN both methods showed significant increases in exercise tolerance (19 and 21 per cent). The heart-rate-controlled test showed a significant increase (33%) after alprenolol, but the change was not significant by the other method. In the patients studied, heart-rate-controlled exercise discriminated between active drug and placebo better than the stepwise increased load test, what might have been due to more optimal matching of the loads obtained in the heart-rate-controlled test. Indications are given about how to design an exercise study in patients with angina pectoris.", 
    "26": "Sympathetic ganglia from 13- to 15-day-old embryonic chicks were cultured for up to 2 days in Leighton tubes. The influence of hydrocortisone and ACTH added to the culture medium on the enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO) and tyrosine hydroxylase was studied. Hydrocortisone (5 times 10(-5)M) had no effect on tyrosine hydroxylase but increased MAO activity by up to 46 percent over control values under conditions of low or zero nerve growth factor (NGF) concentration. ACTH also increased ganglionic MAO activity, the effect again depending on NGF concentration. This time the maximal response (an increase of 50 percent over controls) was seen at high NGF concentrations. This response was similar to the effect of 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and was blocked by 1 times 10-5 M propranolol and 10 muM prostaglandin E(1). ACTH only slightly increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity and this effect was due to a small (18 percent) increase in sympathetic neurone number. Guanosine 5-diphosphate (0.5 mM) was found to increase tyrosine hydroxylase activity by 57 percent and this effect was blocked by the presence of ACTH.", 
    "27": "The effect of muscle length on adrenergic stimulation of canine detrusor was studied in an vitro muscle bath. The commonly reported response of muscle relaxation with norepinephrine stimulation was seen in muscle strips at or near the resting length. When the muscle strips were stretched, however, an alpha receptor mediated contraction was noted. Length, rather than norepinephrine dose or tension, was the predominant factor determining whether a given strip would respond in an alpha or beta fashion. Sympathetic stimulation may enhance accommodation (beta effect) during bladder filling at low muscle length and potentiate bladder emptying (alpha effect) at increased muscle length.", 
    "28": "Information defining the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis as a control system concurrently regulating salt balance and blood pressure has been applied to examine the role of renin in the causation of experimental and clinical forms of renovascular and renal hypertension and thence to develop criteria for differentiating these entities. Experimantally there are two models of renovascular hypertension, one characterized by excess renin with reduced sodium (vasoconstrictor form) and the other by excess sodium with reduced renin (volume form). But with sodium depletion, the volume form switches to a vasoconstrictor form, illustrating how the two factors coordinate to maintain blood pressure. Human renovascular and renal hypertensions appear to be sustained by the same two mechanisms. Experimental and clinical studies both indicate that curable renal hypertension is in fact a renin-dependent vasoconstrictor hypertension. Three criteria, derived from four renin measurements, identify this situation: (1) Hypersecretion of renin is reflected by a high peripheral level when referenced against sodium excretion. (2) Lacteralization of renin secretion with contralateral suppression rules out occult bilateral disease. It is indicated by V-A = 0 from the uninvolved kidney. (3) A third criterion, (V-A)/A greater than 48 per cent from the ipsilat-eral kidney, identifies renal ischemia. These three criteria, when taken together in a combined scoring analysis, provide high precision in identifying the patient with the vasoconstrictor form of renal hypertension that is potentially reversible by appropriate surgery. Absence of these criteria identifies hypertension associated with either occult or overt bilateral renal disease. In these patients, the volume factor often predominates and is expressed by some suppression of plasma renin levels. Here, removal of renal tissue is contraindicated. Corroborative evidence to support these three criteria can be developed from the blood pressure response to angiotensin blocking drugs or to anti-renin therapy with propranolol. Thus in all of these renal hypertensions, the vasoconstrictor and volume factors can be identified using renin measurements and pharmacologic interventions.", 
    "29": "The sympathetic nervous system has been postulated to play a role in the maintenance of renal hypertension. Permanent peripheral sympathectomy was performed by treating newborn rats for 21 days with guanethidine. Sympathectomy was confirmed by (1) relative insensitivity to tyramine, (2) lack of responsiveness to renal nerve stimulation, and (3) absence of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunofluorescence in renal blood vessels. Placement of a clip on the left renal artery led to the development of two-kidney renal hypertension. No differences were observed between the two-kidney renal hypertensive normal and sympathectomized rats; both had elevated plasma renin activity and vasodepression with angiotensin antagonists which were maintained up to nine weeks. Furthermore, in normal rats chronic beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol caused no change in the development of the two-kidney renal hypertension. Similarly, no differences were seen in blood pressure, plasma renin activity, or response to antagonists between the one-kidney renal hypertensive (clip plus contralateral nephrectomy) normal and sympathectomized rats. Both showed sustained low renin hypertension up to 12 weeks. The absence of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system did not affect the development or maintenance of hypertension in either model of hypertension.", 
    "30": "Rat glioma cells grown in culture secrete cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) into the culture medium following stimulation by beta-agonistic catecholamines. Agents which reduced cellular ATP levels such as valinomycin, oligomycin, and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, inhibited cyclic AMP efflux. Secretion of cyclic AMP was also prevented by prostaglandin A-1 and pharmacological agents including probenecid and papaverine. Of the latter agents, only papaverine reduced ATP levels. These results suggest that the transport of cyclic AMP across animal cell membranes is energy-dependent and subject to regulation.", 
    "31": "Saralasin, an angiotensin antagonist, was used to study the role of renin-angiotensin in the vasodilator-beta-blocker drug interaction in hypertensive subjects. Plasma renin activity was elevated by withdrawal of propranolol in seven patients using minoxidil and propranolol. After propranolol withdrawal, saralasin caused hypotension (100/60 mm Hg or less) in five. Propranolol lowered blood pressure and plasma renin activity and diminished the hypotensive response to saralasin. Saralasin induced renin release in all patients, an effect blocked by propranolol. We conclude that angiotensin can be the major determinant of blood pressure in vasodilator-drug treated patients, that propranolol lowering of blood pressure in this vasodilator-beta-blocker drug interaction is related to suppression of renin release, and that the angiotensin feed-back-suppression mechanism for inhibiting renin release in functionally located proximal to beta-adrenergic receptors mediating renin release.", 
    "32": "In rats, catecholamines were found to increase the rate of the muscles spontaneous rhythmic contractions while the alpha- and beta-blocking agents suppressed them. The spontaneous contractions were blocked in the uncalunm medium. Rhythmic electrical stimulation evoked contracture-like responses the uncalunm of which depended on the strength, frequency, and duration of the stimulation. In spontaneoulsy active preparations, single electrical stimuli evoked contractions according to the \"all or nothing\" rule. The membrane potential magnitude varied within the limits of 25-37 mV, and action potentials were related to the contractions. The data obtained suggest that the functional unit of conduction of spontaneous or evoked excitation waves is represented by a group of smooth muscle cells within a single lymphangion.", 
    "33": "The adrenergic receptors mediating the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on the rat thyroid in vivo have been studied by the use of more specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulators, and blocking agents. The effect of methoxamine was similar to that of epinephrine, while isoproterenol stimulated 131-I uptake slightly, and did not alter the ratio of monoiodotyrosine (MIT) to diiodotyrosine (DIT). However, like methoxamine, isoproterenol resulted in a decrease in thyroxine (T4) formation. Phentolamine could partially prevent epinephrine-induced decrease in 131-I uptake and T4 synthesis. The changes in the MIT/DIT ratio could be completely prevented by high doses of phentolamine. Propranolol enhanced the effects of epinephrine. It is concluded that the effect of epinephrine on the rat thyroid in vivo is predominantly alpha-adrenergic, but T4 synthesis may be decreased by stimulation of either receptor.", 
    "34": "The coexistence of pregnancy and idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis is a potentially dangerous combination. We report a 23-year-old white woman with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and pregnancy who presented with severe symptoms (Class IV) and modest outflow obstruction associated with marked mitral regurgitation. After delivery, the evidence for significant mitral regurgitation regressed, while the outflow obstruction seemed unchanged. However, she returned to Functional Class II. We review the mechanisms by which pregnancy and labor may alter the hemodynamics of idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis and we discuss recommendations for the management of these patients during pregnancy, labor, and the immediate postpartum period. We conclude that despite increasing symptoms, most women with diopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis can tolerate pregnancy and a vaginal delivery.", 
    "35": "Observations were conducted in the isolated potassium-arrested dog heart to determine the direct vasodilator effects of adrenergic agonists and antagonists on the coronaryvascular beta receptors, independent of cardiac inotropic and chronotropic influences. Practocol (a selective beta-1-receptor antagonist) blocked coronary vasodilation activated by isoproternol (a combined beta-1-and beta-2-receptor agonist) only at the very high dose of 10-minus 3 M, whereas propranolol (a combined beta-1- and beta-2-receptor antagonist) blocked coronary vasodilation at 10-minus 7 to 10-minus 5 M. Salbutamol (a selective beta-2-receptor agonist) was one-eighth as potent as isoproterenol in producing coronary vasodilation. The potency ratio (1/8) is similiar to valuesreported for other beta receptors classified as type 2. It is concluded that the coronary vasodilator beta receptors are type 2, similiar to those found in peripheral bloodvessels.", 
    "36": "The hepatic K+-mobilizing effects of phenylephrine and isoproterenol were studied in dogs equipped with chronic indwelling portal vein catheters. Animals anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, received intraportal injections of these sympathomimetic amines, alone or in combination, before and after alpha, or beta, or combined adrenergic blockade. Hepatic K+ movements were assessed by measuring systemic arterial and hepatic venous K+ levels. It was concluded that adrenergic blockade exerted no significant influence on the ability of these agents to provoke the initial release and subsequent uptake of K+ by the liver.", 
    "37": "In vitro evidence has indicated that isoproterenol (ISO) is more potent than epinephrine (EPI) in releasing glucose from rabbit liver slices and that propranolol (PROP) is a competitive antagonist of ISO. In contrast, dose-response data from fasted rabbits have shown that EPI is more potent than ISO in increasing plasma glucose levels and in lowering hepatic glycogen levels. Pretreatment with PROP abolished ISO-induced hyperglycemia and changes in liver and muscle glycogen levels whereas only the muscle glycogen depleting effect of EPI was altered significantly. These results suggest that factors other than stimulation of hepatic beta-receptors must be involved in EPI-stimulated depletion of liver glycogen and hyperglycemia in the intact rabbit.", 
    "38": "This investigation compared quantitatively the effects of prostaglandin F2alpha, histamine and acetylcholine on pulmonary airway resistance and dynamic lung compliance in the spontaneously breathing, anesthetized dog. Airway responses were evaluated by computer analysis before and after pharmacological blockade by either atropine or propranolol. In a dose range of 1.0-10.0 mug/kg i.v., prostaglandin F2alpha was the most potent bronchoconstrictor studied. At the highest dose, prostaglandin F2alpha increased airway resistance 153.3% and decreased lung compliance 55.4% from basal levels. Similar doses of either histamine or acetylcholine produced much less effect. Atropine significantly reduced the bronchopulmonary responses evoked by histamine, acetylcholine and prostaglandin F2alpha. Propranolol did not inhibit any of the respiratory effects of those bronchoconstrictors analyzed. The bronchopulmonary effects of prostaglandin F2alpha and histamine appear to be augmented by cholinergic stimuli.", 
    "39": "1 Noradrenaline infused into the internal carotid artery of the dog (0.01-1 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) constricts the blood vessels of the cortex. This constriction is mediated by the action of noradrenaline on alpha-adrenoceptors of the cerebral arteries.2 Intravenous (1 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) or intra common carotid arterial (0.01-1 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) infusions of noradrenaline cause an increase in cortical blood flow that can be dissociated from changes in blood pressure.3 The effect of intravenous noradrenaline on the cortical blood vessels and metabolism is blocked by high PaCO(2) levels, or by the prior administration of (+/-)-propranolol. (+)-Propranolol is without such effect.4 Following section of both vagi and both sinus nerves, intravenous noradrenaline fails to cause an increase in cortical blood flow.5 In another series of animals the area of the carotid bifurcation was vascularly isolated and perfused with blood from a second dog. Chemoreceptor and baroreceptor activity was shown to be intact.6 Administration of 5% CO(2) to the donor dog caused an increase in cerebral blood flow in the recipient dog.7 Administration of intravenous noradrenaline (1.0 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) to the donor animal caused an increase in cerebral blood flow, cerebral O(2) and glucose utilization of the recipient.8 Administration of 5% CO(2) and intravenous (-)-noradrenaline (1.0 mug kg(-1) min(-1)) caused a further increase in flow and metabolism.9 This evidence suggests that the cerebrovasodilatation observed following intravenous noradrenaline is reflex and is triggered by chemoreceptor activity.10 The evidence also suggests that the antagonism of the cortical dilatory effects of intravenous noradrenaline by raised PaCO(2) in the intact animal must be at a site different from the peripheral chemoreceptors.", 
    "40": "The haemodynamic effects of intravenous propranolol at low dosage (1 and 2 mg) have been evaluated on 14 patients in the acute stage of myocardial infarction. The first 1 mg propranolol was not followed by any significant variation in the variables measured. After the second 1 mg propranolol, the heart rate, cardiac index, and stroke index decreased significantly but moderately. Changes in pulmonary wedge pressure were not significant. It is concluded that intravenous propranolol in the small dosage of 1 or 2 mg, at which antiarrhythmic effect is still produced, has only a negligible depressant myocardial effect.", 
    "41": "The relationship between heart rate and left atrial end-diastolic diameter (LAEDD) and left atrial systolic shortening (LASS) was investigated in 12 conscious dogs. Atrial pacing, vagal blockade, isoproterenol, and beta-adrenergic blockade were used to change heart rate and the inotropic state of the atrium. LAEDD decreased linearly as heart rate increased. LAEDD averaged 33.0 mm (+/- 0.6 mm SEM) and decreased by 3.2 mm (+/- 0.4 mm SEM) with a change in heart rate of 50 beats/min. The ratio of LASS/LAEDD decreased as LAEDD decreased with increasing heart rate, but there was less of a reduction in the ratio at the extreme levels of LAEDD change with isoproterenol and vagal blockade. Propranolol reduced LASS at any LAEDD. At lower heart rates the reduction of LASS with pacing could be corrected by returning LAEDD to near control levels with a rapid infusion of fluid. It is concluded that LASS is primarily dependent on LAEDD and the inotropic state of the atrium. At higher heart rates, though, some effect of frequency can be observed. Isoproterenol and vagal blockade (increased contractile state) reduced the dependence of LASS on LAEDD.", 
    "42": "The effects of oral propranolol were evaluated in 10 normal volunteers. The resting heart rate decreased from the mean control value of 68 plus or minus 3.3 (SE) to 56 plus or minus 2.8 beats per minute (bpm) on propranolol (p smaller than 0.001, paired test). Mean systolic blood pressur also decreased from 125 plus or minus 5.0 to 114 plus or minus 4.2 mm Hg (p smaller than 0.03). Resting systolic time intervals were unaffected by propranolol. Mean maximal treadmill exercise tolerance time was not significantly altered by propranolol although the mean heart rate systolic blood pressure product a maximal exertion was markedly decreased (1.91 plus or minus 0.17 vs 2.62 plus or minus 0.17 times 10-4, p smaller than 0.004) . The nonsignificant effect of oral propranolol on resting systolic time intervals and maximum exercise tolerance despite significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure at rest and duringexercise stand in contrast to the reported effects of intravenous propranolol. Explantations for this difference between the effects of oral and intravenous propranolol in normal subjects are examined.", 
    "43": "Intravenous salbutamol, a beta-adrenoceptor stimulant, given to nine patients in normal labour, with continous monitoring of uterine activity and of the maternal and fetal cardiovascular systems, was shown to decrease uterine activity significantly; maternal and fetal heart rates were significantly increased, and maternal systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were significantly decreased during the infusion, although no treatment had to be discontinued because of these effects. Apart from worsening of low back pain during the infusion in one patients, subjective side-effects were trival. With the salbutamol infusion continued at an effective maintenance rate, the carioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, practolol, given intravenously, reduced the maternal heart rate (although not significantly) but it did not alter the fetal heart rate; it also appeared to interfere transiently with the inhibiting action of salbutamol on uterine activity, but cerevical dilatation was arrested until the salbutamol infusion was discontinued. At least in five patients, labour remained suppressed until oxytoxin was infused intravenously.", 
    "44": "This study was performed to identify the efferent pathways which mediate vasodilation during activation of the coronary chemoreflex and to compare the reflex responses in vessels in skeletal muscle and skin. Reflex vasodilator responses (decreases in perfusion pressure) were measured in innervated, perfused gracilis muscle and hindpaw of dogs during activation of the coronary chemoreflex with intracoronary injections of nicotine. Reflex vasodilator responses to intracoronary nicotine (1.25 and 2.50 mu-g per kilogram) averaged -14 plus or minus 5 (S.E.M.) and -34 plus or minus 6 mm. Hg, respectively, in muscle, but only -5 plus or minus 2 and -10 plus or minus 4 mm. Hg, respectively, in paw. Atropine, tripelennamine, and propranolol did not alter the vasodilation. Guanethidine blocked reflex vasodilation in muscle. The reflex vasodilator responses in paw were slight and were not significantly attenuated by guanethidine. The results indicate that sympathetic cholinergic pathways to skeletal muscle do not participate in the coronary chemoreflex. The reflex vasodilation in muscle results from withdrawal of adrenergic constrictor tone. The efferent pathway demonstrates that the coronary chemoreflex does not produce striking withdrawal of adrenergic tone in paw. The results indicate, therefore, that activation of the coronary chemoreflex results in greater withdrawal of adrenergic constrictor tone and greater vasodilation in muscle than in skin.", 
    "45": "d-Isoproterenol (ISO) applied topically to the rabbit eye specifically lowered intraocular pressure. Thus, it effectively reduced normal intraocular pressure and inhibited intraocular pressure elevation induced by water load without causing other obvious local or systemic pharmacologic effects. By comparison, dl-ISO was pharmacologically nonspecific in that amounts required to reduce intraocular pressure also produced significant and marked tachycardia. Furthermore, maximal intraocular pressure reduction was less with dl-than with d-ISO. Accordingly, and in consideration of reported clinical experience with dl-ISO in glaucomatous man, the d-isomer should be the preferred form of ISO for treating glaucoma. d-ISO should offer advantages over any other topical medication used currently in the treatment of this condition. Toxicity studies employing large, topical doses of drug in rabbit eyes showed that d-ISO was free from ocular irritation as well as systemic toxicologic effects and should be safe for controlled studies in man.", 
    "46": "The effective use of vasoactive drugs in shock requires an understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the various types and stages of shock and knowledge of the specific pharmacologic effects of each drug in the abnormal state. Vasoactive drugs should be used after the primary and secondary causes of shock have been corrected. Specific vasoactive drugs should be selected on the basis of measured hemodynamic abnormalities."
