Chronic ICI-118551 treatment did not modify muscle mass, oxidative potential, or protein concentration of the medial gastrocnemius muscle, suggesting that maintenance of these skeletal muscle characteristics is not dependent on beta2-adrenergic-receptor stimulation. However, the drug treatment increased beta-adrenergic-receptor density of the lateral gastrocnemius (42%) and caused an increase in specific (g/g) isometric in situ contractile forces of the medial gastrocnemius [twitch, 56%; tetanic (200 Hz), 28%]. The elevated contractile forces observed after a chronic treatment with ICI-118551 were completely abolished when the beta2-adrenergic antagonist was also administered acutely before measurement of contractile forces, suggesting that this response is beta2-adrenergic-receptor dependent. Possible mechanisms for the increased forces were studied. Caffeine administration potentiated twitch forces but had little effect on tetanic force in control animals. Administration of dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in control animals also resulted in small increases of twitch force but did not modify tetanic forces. We conclude that increases in beta-adrenergic-receptor density and the stimulation of the receptors by endogenous catecholamines appear to be responsible for increased contractile forces but that the mechanism remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "1": "We previously reported that beta-endorphin and morphine administered supraspinally produce antinociception by activating different descending pain-inhibitory systems. To determine the role of spinal calcium channels, calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in the production of antinociception induced by morphine, [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) or beta-endorphin administered supraspinally, the effects of nimodipine (an L-type calcium channel blocker), omega-conotoxin GVIA (an N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker), calmidazolium (a calmodulin antagonist) or KN-62 (a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor) injected intrathecally (i.t.) on the antinociception induced by morphine, DAMGO or beta-endorphin administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) were examined in the present study. Antinociception was assessed by the mouse tail-flick test. The i.t. injection of nimodipine (from 0.024 to 2.4 pmol), omega-conotoxin GVIA (from 0.0033 to 0.33 pmol), calmidazolium (from 0.0015 to 0.15 pmol) or KN-62 (from 0.0014 to 0.14 pmol) alone did not affect the basal tail-flick latencies. The i.t. pretreatment of mice with nimodipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA, calmidazolium or KN-62 dose dependently attenuated the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by beta-endorphin administered i.c.v. However, the inhibition of the tail-flick response induced by morphine or DAMGO administered i.c.v. was not changed by i.t. pretreatment with nimodipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA, calmidazolium or KN-62. The results suggest that spinally located L- and N-type calcium channels, calmodulin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II may be involved in the modulation of antinociception induced by beta-endorphin, but not morphine and DAMGO, administered supraspinally.",

SI was administered in combination with propylthiouracil (10 cases) and beta blockers (all cases), which had been previously initiated. Free serum thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were measured before and after SI therapy on the morning of surgery. SI treatment significantly reduced total T3 concentration from 445.9 to 193.4 ng/dL (P < 0.0001) and free T4 concentration from 3.874 to 2.800 ng/dL (P = 0.0003). Preoperatively, only one patient had persistent tachycardia, and intraoperatively this same patient required beta blockers. Blood loss was unremarkable or reduced (average blood loss, 121 mL). On clinical examination glands were firm with normal or somewhat decreased vascularity. On histologic study all glands demonstrated changes consistent with treated Graves' disease. Preoperative treatment with SI appears to be a safe and efficacious method of preparing hyperthyroid patients for surgery.", 
    "10": "Guidelines for bioequivalence of non-racemic pharmaceuticals are abundant in the literature. However, few guidelines exist for the bioequivalence of racemic drugs which consist of 2 or more stereoisomers. The aim of this article is to address the question of whether the bioequivalence of racemic drugs should be based on the measurement of the individual enantiomers or that of the total drug. Several pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic cases are examined to test the validity of extrapolating the bioequivalence of racemic drugs to that of their individual enantiomers after administration of the racemate; simulation and experimental data are presented to support these cases. It is shown that for drugs which exhibit non-linear pharmacokinetics, the results of bioequivalence studies based on the total drug may differ from those based on the individual enantiomers. Similar discrepancies can be shown for a racemic drug with linear pharmacokinetics whose enantiomers substantially differ from each other in their pharmacokinetic parameters. Therefore, it is suggested that stereospecific assays be used for these drugs. Additionally, it is recommended that for racemic drugs which undergo chiral inversion, and for most products with modified release characteristics, the bioequivalence be assessed using stereospecific assays. Conversely, for racemic drugs with linear pharmacokinetics and minimal to modest stereoselectivity in their kinetic parameters, and for those with non-stereoselective pharmacodynamics, the use of stereospecific analytical methods are not warranted. Finally, the limited, controversial literature in favour of or against the use of stereospecific assays in bioequivalence of chiral drugs are reviewed and a preliminary guideline is proposed.",

The nicotinic receptors near the VTA have been proposed to be important for nicotine self-administration in rats and for tobacco smoking in humans. Nicotinic and muscarinic blockers were microinjected into the VTA of rats trained to lever-press for lateral hypothalamic stimulation via an ipsilateral electrode. The competitive nicotinic blocker dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DH beta E; 5-60 micrograms) shifted rate-frequency curves to the right by a mean of 6-27% in a dose-related manner; the noncompetitive nicotinic blocker mecamylamine (10-300 micrograms) produced similar shifts of 7-21%. Atropine (30 micrograms) shifted the curves to the right by a mean of 82% in three of the sites tested with DH beta E. All blockers decreased maximum bar-pressing rates significantly in some sites when the shifts were large. Therefore, nicotinic receptors in the VTA make small contributions to the maintained rewarding effect of brain-stimulation reward in rats, but muscarinic receptors in the VTA appear to be more important.",

The whole-cell patch-clamp was used for studying the effects of various beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on the L-type Ca current (Ica) in frog ventricular myocytes. 2. Dose-response curves for the effects of isoprenaline (non selective beta-agonist), salbutamol (beta2-agonist), dobutamine (beta1-agonist) on ICa were obtained in the absence and presence of various concentrations of ICI 118551 (beta2-antagonist), metoprolol (beta1-antagonist) and xamoterol (partial beta1-agonist) to derive EC50 (i.e. the concentration of beta-agonist at which the response was 50% of the maximum) and Emax (the maximal response) values by use of a Michaelis equation. Schild regression analysis was performed to examine whether the antagonists were competitive and to determine the equilibrium dissociation constant (K(B)) for the antagonist-receptor complex. 3. Isoprenaline increased ICa with an EC50 of 20.0 nM and an Emax of 597%. ICI 118551 and metoprolol competitively antagonized the effect of isoprenaline with a K(B) of 3.80 nM and 207 nM, respectively. 4. Salbutamol increased ICa with an EC50 of 290 nM and an Emax of 512%. ICI 118551 and metoprolol competitively antagonized the effect of salbutamol with a K(B) of 1.77 nM and 456 nM, respectively. 5. Dobutamine increased ICa with an EC50 of 2.40 microM and an Emax of 265%.

    "22": "Despite remarkable advances in cardiovascular therapeutics, sudden cardiac death remains a significant problem. In this review, data from clinical trials and other studies on antiarrhythmic therapies have been evaluated in order to determine effective strategies for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in high risk patients. Overall, routine prophylactic use of class I antiarrhythmic agents in high risk patients, mostly survivors of acute myocardial infarction, is associated with increased risk of death [61 trials, 23,486 patients: odds ratio (OR) 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.27, p < 0.05]. Conversely, beta-blockers are associated with highly significant reductions in risk of death in postinfarction patients (56 trials, 53,521 patients: OR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75 to 0.87, p < 0.00001). Overall data from the amiodarone trials on high risk patients, including postinfarction patients, patients with congestive heart failure or survivors of cardiac arrest, suggest that this agent is effective in reducing the risk of death (14 trials, 5713 patients: OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.72 to 0.95, p = 0.01) although further studies are needed to better define which types of patients will potentially benefit most from this agent. No benefits were seen with calcium channel blockers (26 trials, 21,644 patients: OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.13, p = NS). The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a promising option for high risk patients, but definition of its role awaits the completion of ongoing clinical trials. Since causes of sudden death are heterogeneous, the clinician should pursue a multifactorial approach to its prevention. Primary and secondary prevention of cardiac ischaemia, through the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and maximising the use of aspirin, beta-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors after acute myocardial infarction, should lead to a future decrease in the incidence of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "23": "In normal thyroid cells, the TSH-adenylate cyclase system plays a pivotal role in controlling growth and differentiation. However, the role of this system in the growth of thyroid carcinoma is not well understood. To investigate this subject, we have established four new human thyroid carcinoma cell lines, designated BHP 2-7, 7-13, 10-3, and 18-21, from different patients. Northern gel analysis revealed that all of these cell lines expressed Pax-8 messenger ribonucleic acid; additionally, only BHP 18-21 cells expressed TTF-1 messenger ribonucleic acid. These cells were treated with various concentrations of 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, TSH, and adrenergic receptor agonist (norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol). Cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell number. In these human thyroid carcinoma cell lines, the addition of 8-bromo-cAMP reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation at a concentration of 10 mumol/L. Forskolin (0.1-10 mumol/L) significantly induced cAMP accumulation, decreased [3H]thymidine incorporation, and reduced cell number in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, TSH (0.01-1 mU/ mL) did not affect the accumulation of cAMP or cell growth. We found that adrenergic receptor agonists induced the accumulation of cAMP and inhibited cell growth. The rank of potency was isoproterenol > epinephrine > > norepinephrine. The binding studies of [3H]CGP-12177, a specific beta-adrenergic agonist, revealed that these new thyroid carcinoma cells had beta-adrenergic receptors. These results indicate that cAMP inhibits the growth of some human thyroid carcinoma cells, and that cAMP production is regulated through beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated pathways, but not through TSH receptor-mediated pathways.", 
    "24": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptors are involved in the elevation of blood pressure, tachycardia, and cardiac hypertrophy in rats chronically exposed to cold (5 degrees C). Four groups of rats were used. Two groups of rats were exposed to 5 degrees C and the other 2 groups were kept at 25 degrees C. In each temperature condition, one group received regular food while the other received food to which a nonspecific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, d,l-propranolol, was added. The blood pressure of the untreated, cold-exposed group increased significantly within 3 weeks of exposure to cold and remained elevated until the end of the experiment. Chronic treatment with d,l-propranolol decreased the rate of cold-induced elevation of blood pressure at doses of 1.0 and 1.2 g/kg of food, and produced a complete reversal of hypertension at a higher dose ( 1.5 g/kg of food). Propranolol also prevented tachycardia in cold-exposed rats. The fact that propranolol decreased the elevation of blood pressure and prevented tachycardia suggests that both beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors are blocked in cold-exposed rats. Propranolol, however, did not affect cold-induced cardiac hypertrophy.",

A double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted in 226 patients with migraine with or without aura, a migraine history of at least 2 years at least 3 documented attacks during the 28 days run-in period. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks following an initial 28 days' run-in period. Patients reported the number of attacks and their severity in a diary. Treatment with bisoprolol 5 mg resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks (39% vs 22%) compared to placebo treatment (p < 0.05). Treatment had no effect on the duration and severity of the attacks. Bisoprolol was well tolerated.", 
    "26": "Local anesthetics inhibit binding of ligands to beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2ARs), and, as a consequence, inhibit intracellular cAMP production. We hypothesized that among homologous local anesthetics, their avidity at inhibiting binding of tritiated dihydroalprenolol (3H-DHA) to beta2ARs would increase with increasing length of alkyl substituents and would demonstrate stereospecificity. Specific binding of 3H-DHA to human beta2ARs was assayed in the presence of six different members of the 1-alkyl-2,6-pipecoloxylidide class of local anesthetics (including mepivacaine, ropivacaine, and bupivacaine), the R(+) and S(-) bupivacaine enantiomers, lidocaine, prilocaine, etidocaine, procaine, and tetracaine. Avidity of binding to beta2ARs increased with increasing length of the alkyl chain (pKi values = 2.4, 3.6, 4.3, 4.1, 4.1, 5.9 for the methyl [mepivacaine], ethyl, S(-)propyl [ropivacaine], butyl [bupivacaine], pentyl, and octyl derivatives, respectively). We found no evidence for bupivacaine stereospecificity (pKi values = 4.3 and 4.9 for the S(-) and R(+) isomers, respectively). Other amide and ester local anesthetics also showed increasing potency with increasing length of alkyl substituents (pKi values = 3.6, 3.8, and 4.3 for lidocaine, prilocaine, and etidocaine; 4.2 and 5.6 for procaine and tetracaine, respectively). The correlation between increased inhibition of beta2AR binding and alkyl chain length resembles the correlation between local anesthetic potency at nerve block and increased alkyl chain length. The lack of clear stereospecificity is consistent with the relatively low potency these agents demonstrate at inhibition of beta2AR binding. Finally, the relatively potent inhibition of beta2ARs by etidocaine, tetracaine, and bupivacaine suggests that their propensity for cardiovascular depression after accidental intravenous overdose could result from beta2AR or beta1AR blockade and inhibition of cAMP production.", 
    "27": "Local anesthetics demonstrate a rank order of avidity for displacing ligands from beta2-adrenergic receptors such that larger molecules displace ligands at lower concentrations than smaller local anesthetic molecules. This relationship between molecular size and receptor avidity could explain the greater propensity for cardiovascular toxicity of relatively large local anesthetics such as bupivacaine.",

Torsade de pointes developed in seven patients (1.8%). Two hundred ten patients (53%) continued to receive d,l-sotalol and were followed up for 34 +/- 18 months (mean +/- SD). The actuarial rates for the absence of arrhythmic recurrence (either VT/VF or sudden death) at 1 and 3 years were 89% and 77%, respectively. Actuarial rates for overall survival at 1 and 3 years were 94% and 86%, respectively.

    "33": "Intraperitoneal administration of the phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram (1-30 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent increase in the circulating levels of both corticosterone and adrenaline in male Balb/c mice. These increases were maximal 0.5-1 h after administration of rolipram and had declined to control levels by 4 h. Rolipram (10 mg/kg i.p.) substantially inhibited the production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) ex vivo in blood from normal mice but was ineffective in adrenalectomized mice, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of rolipram is dependent on intact adrenal function. The corticosterone antagonist, RU 486, and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, both partially reversed the inhibitory activity of rolipram while the combination of RU 486 and popranolol abrogated the effect of the rolipram to the same degree as adrenalectomy. These data suggest the release of both corticosterone and adrenaline contribute to the ability of rolipram to inhibit TNF-alpha production in mouse blood ex vivo.", 
    "34": "To study whether the changes in cortical noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease are the consequence of reduced cortical cholinergic activity, a novel colinergic immunotoxin (conjugate of the monoclonal antibody 192IgG against the lower affinity nerve growth factor receptor with the cytotoxic protein saporin, 192IgG-saporin) was used to produce a specific and selective loss of cholinergic cells in rat basal forebrain nuclei. To correlate the responses to cholinergic immunolesion in cholinoceptive cortical target regions with cholinergic hypoactivity, quantitative receptor autoradiography to measure adrenoceptors and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes, and histochemistry to estimate acetylcholinesterase activity, were performed in adjacent brain sections. alpha 1-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A receptor binding were not affected by cholinergic immunolesion in any of the cortical and hippocampal regions studied. However, cholinergic immunolesion resulted in significantly reduced alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor as well as 5-HT2A receptor binding in a number of cortical and hippocampal regions displaying a reduced activity of acetylcholinesterase, already detectable seven days after a single injection of 192IgG-saporin and persisting up to three months post lesion without any significant recovery. The data suggest that at least a subpopulation of alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor as well 5-HT2A receptor subtype is present on cortical and hippocampal cholinergic terminals originating in the basal forebrain. The lesion-induced receptor changes suggest that the alterations in cortical 5-HT2 receptor binding observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease might be secondary to cholinergic deficits.", 
    "35": "Single-channel and whole-mitoplast patch-clamp recordings were employed to characterize the 108-pS (Cl-) channel in brown fat mitochondrial mitoplasts. We demonstrated the ability of this channel to conduct di- and trivalent anions, such as sulfate, phosphate, and benzenetricarboxylates, and its blockage by propranolol, 1,4-dihydropyridine-type Ca2+ antagonists, and Cibacron blue. Moreover, we have revealed its pH dependence for the first time. As a basis for the characteristic potential dependence of the whole-mitoplast current, we identified an open probability, increasing with depolarizing (positive) potentials, Eh, and being almost zero in the hyperpolarizing range. Events at negative Eh exhibit a short flickering behavior, whereas at positive Eh, they become much longer. This voltage dependence is influenced by pH in such a way that, at acidic pH, the 108-pS channel possesses a low open probability throughout the observed potential range, whereas at alkaline pH, the channel switches to long openings, even at a negative potential. All these properties lead us to conclude that the inner membrane anion channel, which has been characterized only by light scattering studies, and the 108-pS inner membrane channel, which has been characterized electrophysiologically, are one and the same process.", 
    "36": "Extracellular ATP (ATPe) is known to cause release of processed IL-1 beta from LPS-treated macrophages and microglial cells. IL-1 beta release is fast and thought to be associated with cell death. We have reinvestigated this process to identify 1) the purinergic receptor involved; 2) the relationship to cell death; and 3) pharmacologic agonists or antagonists able to modulate IL-1 beta release. Our data confirm that ATPe is a powerful stimulus for IL-1 beta release from LPS-treated human macrophages; however, we also show that IL-1 beta release is not necessarily associated with cell death, as it occurs at lower ATP concentrations and much earlier than leakage of cytoplasmic markers. The selective purinergic P2Z receptor agonist benzoylbenzoyl ATP was at least one order of magnitude more powerful than ATP, but also had a strong cytotoxic effect. 2-Methylthio-ATP was equipotent as ATPe at the optimal concentration of 1 mM, but markedly inhibitory at higher concentrations. The irreversible P2Z blocker-oxidized ATP completely inhibited ATPe-induced IL-1 beta release. IL-1 beta release also was inhibited by increasing the K+ concentration of the incubation medium. These data suggest that ATPe triggers IL-1 beta via the purinergic P2Z receptor recently shown to be expressed by human macrophages and identified as a new member of the P2X family (P2X7), and provide pharmacologic tools for the modulation of IL-1 beta release in vitro and, possibly, in vivo.", 
    "37": "Milnacipran, a dual noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) uptake inhibitor, increased extracellular levels of NA and 5-HT in hypothalamus of freely moving guinea pigs as measured by microdialysis.

Levels of the NA metabolite 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were decreased by milnacipran at 10 and 40 mg/kg i.p., whereas those of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) showed no effect. Subcutaneous injection of 5-HT1A and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist (-)-pindolol alone, at 10 mg/kg, had no effect on the extracellular levels of NA or 5-HT. The concomitant administration of (-)-pindolol (10 mg/kg s.c.) with milnacipran (10 mg/kg i.p.) increased severalfold the effect of milnacipran on the extracellular levels of NA and 5-HT. These results indicate that milnacipran, by blocking the uptake of NA and 5-HT, increases virtually equipotently the extracellular levels of NA and 5-HT, confirming previous in vitro studies. In addition, the antagonism of 5-HT1A autoreceptors by (-)-pindolol potentiates the action of milnacipran on both NA and 5-HT systems, without modifying the ratio of these activities.", 
    "38": "Glucose stimulation of pancreatic islets is characterized by an initial decline in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (phase 0), followed by an increase in peak [Ca2+]i (phase 1). The effect of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and cyclic nucleotides on the glucose-induced phase 0 [Ca2+]i was investigated by Fura-2 fluorescent imaging in single beta-cells from isolated islets of rats maintained at 1.67 mmol/l glucose. ANP (1 nmol/l to 1 micromol/l) inhibited the glucose (8.2 mmol/l)-induced phase 0 [Ca2+], in a concentration-dependent manner. Forskolin, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8BrcAMP), and 8-bromo-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (8BrcGMP) also inhibited the glucose-induced phase 0 [Ca2+]i. The Ca2+ channel blocker, D 600, prevented the response to 8BrcAMP but not to ANP or 8BrcGMP on phase 0 [Ca2+]i. Thapsigargin (TG) also inhibited phase 0 [Ca2+]i by 90%. ANP, 8BrcGMP, and TG also reduced the time required for glucose to initiate the phase 1 increase in [Ca2+]i, and each of these agents potentiated the effect of glucose on peak [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, sarco(endo)-plasmic reticulum (Ca[2+] + Mg2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity in RINm5F insulinoma cells was inhibited by 8BrcGMP and TG, but not 8BrcAMP. Thus, ANP and cGMP modulate [Ca2+]i regulation in pancreatic beta-cells perhaps through mechanisms involving changes in SERCA activity and Ca2+ influx.", 
    "39": "We prospectively performed the follow-up study in 11 female patients with Takayasu arteritis and severe aortic regurgitation by echocardiography. A mean follow-up period was 4 years. The inflammatory state was controlled in all patients. Antihypertensive agents including beta-blocker were administered in nine patients. Heart failure did not progress in all patients except one. No candidate for cardiac surgery appeared during the follow-up period. Aortic root diameter, left atrial, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, wall thickness, left ventricular mass, and percent fractional shortening of the left ventricle showed no significant change in echocardiography. These data indicate that left ventricular disturbance might be slowly progressive in patients with Takayasu arteritis and severe aortic regurgitation. Systemic hypertension and the inflammatory state should be well controlled in managing the patients. beta-blocker might be useful in some patients with Takayasu arteritis and severe aortic regurgitation. Further follow-up is necessary for the decision of the cardiac surgical indication.", 
    "40": "It has been proposed that the positive inotropic action of different drugs is influenced by the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K(ATP)). This hypothesis was tested by investigating the effects of rimalkalim ((3S,4R)-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-4-(oxo-1 pyrrolidinyl)-6-phenyl-sulfonylchroman hemihydrate (formerly HOE-234)) as activator of K(ATP) channels on the positive inotropic action of forskolin, L-phenylephrine hydrochloride and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate). Experiments were performed with the isolated guinea-pig heart papillary muscle. The force of contraction (Fc), velocity of contraction (+dF/dt) and relaxation (-dF/dt), time to peak contraction (t(tp)) and duration of contractions at the level of 10% or more of their total amplitude (t(t10)) were measured. Pretreatment with 1 microM rimalkalim had no significant influence on the positive inotropic effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and L-phenylephrine in the presence of 1 microM metoprolol. However, the positive inotropic effects of L-phenylephrine in the absence of metoprolol were significantly attenuated after pretreatment with rimalkalim. The increase in force and velocity of contraction induced by forskolin was strongly enhanced under these conditions. Addition of 1 microM glibenclamide, an inhibitor of K(ATP) channels, to rimalkalim, prevented the above-mentioned changes in the positive inotropic effects of phenylephrine and forskolin obtained after pretreatment with rimalkalim. What is more, addition of 0.2 microM thapsigargin, a selective blocker of Ca2+-adenosinetriphosphatase of sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+ ATP-ase), abolished the potentiation of the positive inotropic action of forskolin induced by pretreatment with rimalkalim. These results demonstrate that activation of K(ATP) channels by rimalkalim alters beta-adrenoceptors, but has no effect on alpha-adrenoceptor signalling pathways and enhances forskolin inotropic effects by a mechanism which probably involves Ca2+ ATP-ase.",

    "42": "Serotonergic influence on spinal monosynaptic transmission and the desensitization of spinal 5-HT1A receptors following a single pretreatment with a 5-HT1A ligand were examined in vivo in acutely spinalized adult rats. Administration of a selective 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg kg-1) significantly depressed the monosynaptic mass reflex (MMR) amplitude, which was prevented effectively by S(-)-propranolol, a 5-HT1A antagonist. The inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on MMR amplitude was significantly attenuated with a single dose of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg kg-1, s.c.) administered 24 h before the experiments, indicating a marked desensitization of spinal 5-HT1A receptors. Desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors could be reversed by treatment of spiperone (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) 3 h before 8-OH-DPAT pretreatment. These results demonstrate that 5-HT1A receptor functionally modulates the spinal motor output and confirms the ability of 8-OH-DPAT to desensitize presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors as observed for the first time in rat spinal cord.", 
    "43": "The binding site of the beta2 adrenergic receptor, like that of other homologous G-protein-coupled receptors, is contained within a water-accessible crevice formed among its seven membrane-spanning segments. Methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), a charged, hydrophilic, lipophobic, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, had no effect on the binding of agonist or antagonist to wild-type beta2 receptor expressed in HEK 293 cells. This suggested that no endogenous cysteines are accessible in the binding site crevice. In contrast, in a constitutively active beta2 receptor, MTSEA significantly inhibited antagonist binding, and isoproterenol slowed the rate of reaction of MTSEA. This implies that at least one endogenous cysteine becomes accessible in the binding site crevice of the constitutively active beta2 receptor. Cys-285, in the sixth membrane-spanning segment, is responsible for the inhibitory effect of MTSEA on ligand binding to the constitutively active mutant. The acquired accessibility of Cys-285 in the constitutively active mutant may result from a rotation and/or tilting of the sixth membrane-spanning segment associated with activation of the receptor. This rearrangement could bring Cys-285 to the margin of the binding site crevice where it becomes accessible to MTSEA.",

It has been shown that HRV is depressed during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and that it recovers with time. Beta-blockers reduce mortality after AMI and changes in sympathico-vagal activity have been suggested to be of importance. Under certain animal experimental conditions, metoprolol has been reported to increase vagal tone more than atenolol, which could have clinical implications. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of atenolol and metoprolol treatments on HRV during 6 weeks after AMI and to follow the post MI changes in HRV in patients on betablockers.",

The saturation studies revealed that the inhibition by desipramine (1-4 microM), (-)-propranolol (1 microM) and (-)-alprenolol (3 microM) resulted from a reduction of the Bmax value without alteration of the Kd of [3H]DTG binding to the cortex or hippocampus. In contrast, imipramine, (+/-)-pentazocine, clomipramine and risperidone competitively attenuated the cortical or hippocampal [3H]DTG binding. These findings demonstrate the uncompetitive inhibition of [3H]DTG binding by neuroactive drugs, thereby providing further support for the possible multiple regulation of cerebral sigma receptors.", 
    "49": "Lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia was used for asymmetric hydrolysis of the substrate (+/-)1-chloro-2-acetoxy-3-(1-naphthyloxy)-propane, which is a precursor for (S)-(-)-beta-blocker synthesis. Because this substrate is insoluble in water and partially soluble in hydrophobic solvents such as hexane and octane, a mixture of hydrophilic organic solvents and aqueous buffer was used to study the initial reaction rates. Because of the amphipathic nature of the substrate, it can remain in three different forms: (1) monomeric (solution); (2) micellar; and (3) emulsion, depending on the acetone and substrate concentrations in the medium. This behavior is presented in a phase diagram. The enzyme was found to be active with micelle as well as emulsion form of the substrate, whereas it showed negligible activity with the monomeric form. Michaelis-Menten constants were determined experimentally for the emulsion and micellar part of the substrate. The initial rate of hydrolysis (v(0)) goes through a maximum with respect to the acetone content of the mixture. It is due to the combined effect of various factors occurring simultaneously with the increase in acetone content in the solvent. These phenomena are discussed based on the interfacial activation of lipase, deactivation of the enzyme at very high acetone concentration, and increase in critical micelle concentration (CMC) and critical emulsion concentration (CEC) with the increase in acetone content in the solvent.

The present study was to investigate the signal transduction pathway utilized by PTX to initiate myeloid cell adhesion in serum. Immunoblotting study showed that PTX induced tyrosine phosphorylation of two cytoplasmic proteins of 150 kDa and 90 kDa in TGF-beta1/D3-primed U937 cells in a time-dependent manner. In addition, PTX-induced myelomonocytic cell adhesion was abolished in the presence of genistein (100 microM), a specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 2LPM19c (2 microg/ml), a mouse monoclonal antibody against the CD11b subunit of Mac-1 integrin, or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA, 5 mM) prevented PTX-mediated U937 cell adhesion. On the other hand, nifedipine (1 microM), a calcium channel blocker, significantly reduced PTX-induced U937 cell adhesion. Taken together, it is suggested that binding of PTX to Mac-1 integrin receptor on primed U937 cells triggers protein tyrosine phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, Ca(+2) influx, which eventually lead to monocytic cell adhesion in serum.",

Stimulation of the carotid and aortic bodies caused an increase in the atrioventricular conduction time. 3. Evidence is presented to suggest that this negative dromotropic response was due predominantly to a vagal cholinergic mechanism.

    "70": "The 39-42 amino acid residue amyloid beta peptide (A beta), the major protein component in senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloidosis in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been shown to be neurotoxic in vitro. Accumulating data from several areas suggest that cerebrovascular dysfunction and damage may also play a significant role in the AD process. For instance, we have recently demonstrated enhanced vasoconstriction and resistance to relaxation in intact rat aorta treated with A beta [Thomas et al., beta-Amyloid-mediated vasoactivity and vascular endothelial damage, Nature, 380 (1996) 168-171]. Significant vessel damage occurred after thirty minutes of exposure, but could be prevented with superoxide dismutase. To further investigate the role of A beta toxicity on endothelial cells, we have applied A beta peptides to cultures of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Our results show that both A beta(1-42) and A beta(25-35) are toxic to HAEC in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and that this toxicity can be partially prevented by the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, and the antioxidant, superoxide dismutase. The common form of A beta, A beta(1-40), which has been shown to be neurotoxic, is much less toxic to HAEC. A beta toxicity to HAEC occurs within 30 min of treatment with relatively lower doses than those usually observed in primary cultured neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells. It was recently reported that a variety of mutations in the beta-amyloid protein precursor gene and the Presenilin-1 and -2 genes linked to early-onset familial AD cause an increase in the plasma concentration of A beta(1-42) in mutation carriers [Scheuner et al., Secreted amyloid beta-protein similar to that in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease is increased in vitro by the presenilin 1 and 2 and APP mutations linked to familial Alzheimer's disease, Nature Med., 2 (1996) 864-870]. Human aortic endothelial cells are more sensitive to A beta(1-42) than A beta(1-40), via a pathway involving an excess of superoxide free radicals and influx of extracellular calcium. Finally, we have evidence that both apoptotic and necrotic processes are activated by the A beta peptides in these endothelial cells.", 
    "71": "The aim of the present investigation was to determine the reasons why the muscarinic receptor agonist talsaclidine (WAL 2014 FU, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2] octane,3-(2-propynyloxy)-, (R)-,(E)-2-butenedioate) is devoid of bronchospastic effects in anaesthetized guinea pigs but causes contracture in isolated tracheal muscle from this species. Effects on airway resistance were assessed with a modified Konzett-Rossler method in guinea pigs anaesthetized with urethane. Intravenous injection of 1-64 mg/kg talsaclidine did not cause substantial bronchospasm in control animals. After blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, the muscarinic receptor agonist induced dose-dependent bronchospasm which could be blocked by atropine. In despinalized animals and in animals with spinal transection, talsaclidine was bronchospastic but ED50 values were higher and maximal effects were smaller than in intact animals after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. In adrenalectomized guinea pigs, talsaclidine was nearly as bronchospastic as after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. In contrast, the muscarinic ganglion stimulant McN-A-343, 4-(m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-butyn-trimethyl-ammonium chloride, (2-32 mg/kg i.v.), which has a muscarinic receptor profile similar to that of talsaclidine, i.e., full muscarinic agonism and highest affinity at muscarinic M1 receptors, partial agonism at muscarinic M3 receptors, but in contrast to talsaclidine does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, caused dose-dependent bronchospasm in control animals. These results indicate that talsaclidine has bronchospastic potential which, however, does not become evident in vivo because of functional antagonism via beta-adrenoceptors resulting from concomitant activation of the sympathetic nervous system in general and the adrenals in particular. It can be concluded that the unique profile of action of talsaclidine is due to partial agonism at bronchial muscarinic M3 receptors, a prerequisite for susceptibility to functional antagonism, and to its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier readily and to induce sympathetic activation as a result of full agonism at peripheral ganglionic and adrenal as well as central muscarinic M1 receptors.",

    "78": "Mouse brown adipocytes in primary culture were shown to contain high levels of mRNA for interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) which could be further stimulated up to 9-fold by norepinephrine (NE). Even higher stimulation by NE, up to 40-fold, was found in case of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Time-course of activation of both genes was biphasic, but the response of IL-6 gene was slower than of IL-1alpha gene. IL-1alpha mRNA level reached the maximum after 1 h and the second, lower increase, occurred after 8 h. IL-6 mRNA level showed first maximum after 2 h, but the highest level was found after 8 h. Similarly to NE, the expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 genes was stimulated by selective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, beta3-selective agonist CGP-12117, forskoline and db-cAMP. The activation of both genes by CGP-12177 was dose-dependent with the optimum at 100 nM concentration. Stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by cirazoline and oxymetazoline was without any effect. When the expression of IL-6 was studied at the protein level, the stimulation of IL-6 gene via beta3-receptors resulted in secretion of IL-6 up to the concentration 10 ng/ml culture media in 24 h. The results indicate a new type of regulation of expression of IL-1alpha and IL-6 genes in brown adipocytes by catecholamines acting via beta3-adrenergic receptors. The resulting increase in IL-6 production by brown adipocytes could significantly contribute to systemic levels of IL-6.", 
    "79": "The effect of supramaximal electric field stimulation on 3H released from rat spleen strips was studied after loading with either [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) or [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE). In some experiments, [3H]DA and [3H]NE stored in the tissue or released in response to electrical stimulation were separated from their tritiated metabolites using HPLC followed by radiochemical detection. The stimulation-evoked release of 3H after loading with either derivative was subject to negative feedback modulation through alpha2-adrenergic, D2-dopamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and could be prevented by either calcium removal or tetrodotoxin blocking of Na+ influx, indicating its neuronal and vesicular origin. After the separation of radioactive metabolites by HPLC, both the tissue loaded with [3H]DA and the fractions collected during electrical stimulation contained a considerable amount of [3H]NE, providing evidence that the neurons it originated from were adrenergic in function. [3H]DA was also released during electrical stimulation. Since the spleen does not receive dopaminergic innervation, it was concluded that the noradrenergic axon terminals in the spleen were able to take up DA, convert it in part into NE, and release it as both DA and NE in response to neural activity. The ratio of [3H]DA and [3H]NE in the spleen loaded with [3H]DA was found to be dependent on both temperature and time of loading, and could be modulated by various drugs such as desmethylimipramine, a NE uptake blocker, and disulfiram or fusaric acid, dopamine beta-hydroxylase inhibitors.

    "88": "The examination of the computerized files of our central database, showed that verapamil was administered (as a monotherapy or in association) to 4% of the patients, compared to 34% of beta-blockers. The choice between the two drugs appeared not to be influenced by age (62 +/- 11 vs 57 +/- 8 years), anterior (70% vs 57%) or inferior (30% vs 40%) MI location or echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (50.2 +/- 10% vs 52.3 +/- 11%), which were comparable in both groups. On the other hand, beta-blockers were used significantly more often (52% vs 10%; p < 0.05) in the presence of hypertension, while verapamil was preferred (although statistical significance was not reached) in patients with contraindications to beta-blockers, such as chronic obstructive lung disease or peripheral artery disease (20% vs 9% and 10% vs 4%; p = ns, respectively).",

A wider use of verapamil (and even more of beta-blockers) would be however hoped for, due to the relevant number of patients (62% of our population) treated with drugs, such as diltiazem, dihydropyridines or nitrates, for which a conclusive demonstration of efficacy on major clinical end-points are lacking.",

The treatment of elderly patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) represents an increasingly important challenge for the physician. The decreasing mortality rate for AMI in the general population is countered by an increasingly high mortality rate among the elderly. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of the results of clinical studies on the treatment of AMI in community hospitals, and to highlight any differences in treatment and prognosis depending on age.", 
    "91": "123 patients with AMI were divided into two groups: (1) young patients (61.2%) aged under 75 (76 patients of whom 64 were male, with a mean age of 61.08 +/- 9.63) and (2) elderly patients (38.8%) aged over 75 (47 patients of whom 26 were male, with a mean age of 81.77 +/- 3.94).

Thrombolysis was more frequently performed in young patients than in the aged (60.5% vs 10.6%; p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that age, Killip's class and time at hospitalization were variables predicting the exclusion from fibrinolysis. During hospitalization the elderly group received oral beta-blockers less frequently (8.5% vs 40.8%; p = 0.0001); on discharge, they less frequently received ACE-inhibitors (14.9% vs 46.1%; p = 0.0004), aspirin (48.9% vs 77.6%; p = 0.001), beta-blockers (12.8% vs 44.7%; p = 0.0002). The elderly group revealed a higher mortality rate both during hospitalization (19.1% vs 3.9%; p = 0.01) and follow-up (44.7% vs 11.0%; p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed a direct correlation between ventricular arrhythmia and Killip's class and hospital mortality, whereas smoking and time at hospitalization were inversely correlated. Mortality during follow-up was directly associated with Killip's class and inversely to the use of ACE-inhibitors during hospitalization, and beta-blockers and diuretics on discharge. Kaplan-Meier analysis did not show any differences in the survival rate of the two groups, but the first year after AMI was particularly critical for elderly patients among whom 40% of all deaths were recorded.", 
    "93": "This study confirms the application in clinical practice of the results of clinical studies also in community hospitals, and shows that elderly AMI patients are high-risk patients. The high mortality in the latter group is correlated to the fact that they are less eligible to undergo fibrinolytic therapy and have a lower probability of receiving drugs of proven efficacy as a means of increasing survival after AMI. Further clinical studies are required to reduce mortality after AMI in a population that is increasingly widely represented in community hospitals.",

Among patients who were discharged from hospital, the age range was 24-101 (median 70) years, 70% were men, 35% had experienced an anterior AMI and 31% had suffered an inferior AMI. Congestive heart failure was observed in 51% of the patients. Among patients discharged from hospital (n = 740), those with severe congestive heart failure had a mortality of 67% compared with 51% for those with moderate heart failure and 31% for those with no heart failure (P < 0.001). When simultaneously considering age, sex, history of cardiovascular disease, various complications in hospital and medication at discharge, the development of congestive heart failure was found to be an independent predictor of death. The mode and place of death after initial discharge from hospital was similar in patients with and in those without congestive heart failure. Among patients with congestive heart failure who were discharged from hospital, the following factors were associated with an increased risk of death: older age (P < 0.001), no prescription of beta-blockers at discharge (P < 0.01) and a previous history of infarction (P < 0.05).",

    "98": "Tamsulosin, an alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist, has recently been approved to treat patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Tamsulosin is highly selective for prostatic receptors with minimal affinity for vascular receptors. Therefore, it should have little effect on blood pressure and should not potentiate other agents' antihypertensive activity. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate how coadministration of tamsulosin would affect the pharmacodynamic profiles of nifedipine, enalapril, and atenolol. Each study enrolled 12 hypertensive men aged 45 years or older whose blood pressure was being controlled with maintenance doses of nifedipine (study 1), enalapril (study 2), or atenolol (study 3). All 36 subjects were treated with placebo for 5 days and then randomly assigned to either placebo (control group) or tamsulosin therapy (0.4 mg/d for 7 days followed by 0.8 mg/d for 7 days) in addition to continuing their maintenance antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored over a 24-hour period on study days 4, 11, and 19. Coadministration of tamsulosin in these small studies had no clinically significant effects on the pharmacodynamic action of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol; it produced no clinically significant differences in pulse rate and blood pressure, did not alter electrocardiographic or Holter monitoring results, and did not cause increased side effects. Coadministration of tamsulosin with the three antihypertensive agents studied had a favorable safety profile. Our results in these small studies indicate that the dose of nifedipine, enalapril, or atenolol did not require adjustment in patients given tamsulosin, which may give tamsulosin an advantage over other alpha-blocking agents used to treat patients with BPH. Now that tamsulosin has been approved in the United States, further clinical use may confirm these findings.",

One electrode positioned in the right atrium and another electrode located in the coronary sinus were connected to a dual-chamber pacemaker. The electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel, the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel. The pacemaker was programmed in DDD-mode with an AV-delay of 30 ms. Under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient's history, 24-h-Holter-ECG, nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow-up of 8 months.", 
    "100": "In 17 patients suffering from recurrent episodes of vasovagal syncope as well as in 21 healthy subjects without clinical episodes of presyncope or syncope, we evaluated the reflex decrease in heart rate evoked by the phenilephrine test. In the syncopal patients, the measurements were taken 4-12 hours after the clinical appearance of syncope. We divided the syncopal patients as follows: 9 patients, undergoing pharmacological treatment, and 8 untreated patients (drug free arm). In the pharmacological arm of the study, an alternate, randomized administration of metoprolol (150 mg twice daily for 2 days) and verapamil (80 mg every 6 hours for 2 days) was provided. Therefore, in the pharmacological arm as well as in drug free patients, we tested again the baroreflex sensitivity, by means of iv phenilephrine bolus, 3 and 7 days after the clinical appearance of the syncopal event. The baroreflex sensitivity values were significantly higher in the syncopal group compared to the control group (21 +/- 5 vs 13 +/- 4.5 ms/mm Hg; p < 0.01). Of the two tested drugs, only the metoprolol produced a fast (day 3) decrease in baroreflex sensitivity. On the basis of measurements taken after 7 days, we noted a pattern of widespread reduction in baroreflex sensitivity values, found in both treated and untreated patients. In conclusion, patients with vasovagal syncope exhibited a more pronounced maximal parasympathetic activation compared to the control group. The high baroreflex sensitivity values were soon (day 3) reduced by metoprolol, but not by verapamil therapy; a spontaneous normalization in baroreflex sensitivity values was found 7 days after the clinical episode, regardless of therapy.", 
    "101": "Lungs from near-term fetal guinea pigs (62 +/- 2 days of gestation) were supported in vitro for 3 h; lung liquid production was monitored by a dye dilution method. Studies based on 42 preparations investigated effects of epinephrine at different concentrations. Untreated preparations produced lung liquid with no significant change (ANOVA; regression analysis; rates in successive hours 1.37 +/- 0.30; 1.36 +/- 0.30, and 1.28 +/- 0.27 mL.kg-1 body weight.h-1); those given epinephrine at 10(-9), 10(-8), 5 x 10(-8), and 10(-7) M showed significant reductions in production or fluid reabsorption, and there was a linear relationship (r = 0.99) between log concentration and the percent reductions. Above these levels, responses decreased, and at 10(-5) M epinephrine there was no response. There was no evidence for activation of beta-adrenoreceptors; responses to 10(-8) M epinephrine were resistant to propranolol (based on 24 studies), and the specific beta-agonist isoproterenol was without effect (based on 18 studies). However, the alpha-antagonist phentolamine completely eliminated responses to epinephrine at physiological levels (10(-8) M epinephrine; based on 24 studies) and also at levels that gave maximal responses (10(-7) M epinephrine; based on 24 studies). It is concluded that epinephrine is able to promote lung fluid reabsorption at concentrations reported at birth, but that, in contrast with beta-activation in sheep, responses in the guinea pig are mediated through alpha-adrenoreceptors. Clearly, species differences exist.", 
    "102": "Norepinephrine and angiotensin II are potent vasoconstrictors and stimulate thermogenesis (oxygen uptake) as well as lactate and glycerol efflux in the constant-flow perfused rat hind limb at rest. However, the mechanism by which oxygen uptake (VO2) is increased is unknown, and it is not clear whether vasoconstriction is required for the increase in VO2 by the hind limb. In the present study the association between vasoconstriction and VO2 was further investigated, and a chance observation that high-dose propranolol selectively blocked vasoconstrictor-induced increase in VO2 was further explored. The norepinephrine-mediated increase in VO2 was totally blocked by either 50 microM (+)-propranolol or 50 microM (-)-propranolol (active beta-blocking enantiomer), but only (+)-propranolol reduced the vasoconstriction. Similarly, 100 microM (+/-)-propranolol (a dose likely to cause plasma membrane stabilizing effects involving interruption and (or) prevention of action potentials) blocked increases in VO2, lactate, and glycerol efflux by 5 nM angiotensin II (a nonadrenergic vasoconstrictor) with only marginal effects on pressure development. (+/-)-Propranolol (100 microM) had no effect on postequilibration red blood cell washout mediated by angiotensin II, a putative indicator of vasoconstrictor-induced redistribution of flow. Quinidine (260 microM) (an antiarrhythmic agent with membrane-stabilizing activity) inhibited only the increase in VO2, but neither nadolol (300 microM) nor atenolol (300 microM) (beta-blockers without membrane-stabilizing activity) inhibited VO2 or perfusion pressure increases produced by 5 nM angiotensin II. Veratridine (a membrane labilizer that is capable of evoking plasma membrane depolarization by maintaining voltage-gated Na+ channels in their open state) increased VO2 without vasoconstriction, and the increase in VO2 was blocked by 100 microM (+/-)-propranolol. It is concluded that the increase in hind-limb VO2 results from a destabilization of skeletal muscle plasma membranes. This can be achieved directly by veratridine or indirectly by angiotensin II, involving vasoconstriction and redistribution of flow. The findings suggest a novel mechanism for resting muscle thermogenesis.",

A multicenter randomized, double-blind, two-way, crossover study design was used. After a placebo run-in period (4-6 weeks), during which all antihypertensive therapy was withdrawn, 82 patients were randomized. During the active treatment periods (8 weeks each), patients received either bisoprolol once daily or nifedipine retard twice daily, using the double-dummy technique. A washout period (4-6 weeks) separated the treatment periods. Data at baseline (at randomization) and at the end of each treatment period were compared. Seventy-five patients completed the study. Blood pressure (168 +/- 2/103 +/- 1 mmHg) decreased (p < 0.001) similarly with bisoprolol (153 +/- 2/90 +/- 1 mmHg) and nifedipine (154 +/- 2/90 +/- 1 mmHg). Compared with baseline values, none of the quality of life variables investigated changed during bisoprolol or nifedipine retard use. Neither in the intention-to-treat nor the efficacy analysis were differences between bisoprolol and nifedipine found in quality of life variables, such as the Health Status Index, somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, total psychiatric morbidity, cognitive symptoms, and hostility score. Only in the efficacy analysis did Health Status Index tend to be better (p = 0.055) during nifedipine intake when compared with bisoprolol. This trend was not present in the intention-to-treat analysis. The number of dropouts during bisoprolol (n = 2) and nifedipine (n = 3) treatment, and the number of patients reporting side effects (21% and 16%, respectively) did not differ (p = 0.64) between both treatments. It can be concluded that at equipotent antihypertensive dosages, an 8-week treatment period with the selective beta1-blocker bisoprolol or the calcium antagonist nifedipine as a retard formulation does not result in any difference in quality of life variables. It is not clear whether the trend of Health Status Index to become better during nifedipine intake, which was only found in the efficacy analysis and not in the intention-to-treat analysis, is of clinical relevance.",

Change in heart period (interbeat interval) from baseline, induced by atropine, defined parasympathetic control (PC), and the subsequent change, after esmolol administration, defined sympathetic control (SC). The heart period, after PC and SC blockade, defined intrinsic heart period (I). In the OB group, baseline heart period and PC were lower, and SC and I were higher, than in the NO group. The results in the OB, relative to the NO subjects, are similar to those reported in a previous study of NO subjects who had undergone a 10% weight gain by overfeeding.

To determine whether the establishment of dendritic form by developing retinal ganglion cells depends on activity within their targets, the sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX), was administered via minipumps to the diencephalon of cat fetuses from embryonic day 43 (E43) to E57. At E57 retinae were removed and living retinal ganglion cells injected in vitro with Lucifer yellow to reveal their dendritic morphology. In the TTX-treated animals both alpha and beta types of retinal ganglion cells were present, as were putative gamma cells. Overall, the dendrites of retinal ganglion cells in TTX-treated animals appeared qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of untreated animals. The only significant change in the TTX-treated cases was a small increase in the number of dendritic spines on the non-beta cells. These results indicate that the acquisition of basic dendritic form of developing ganglion cells is not influenced by the action potential activity within their targets, and that it is also independent of the terminal branching patterns of their axons.", 
    "131": "Jimson weed (Datura stramonium, a member of the Belladonna alkyloid family) is a plant growing naturally in West Virginia and has been used as a home remedy since colonial times. Due to its easy availability and strong anticholinergic properties, teens are using Jimson weed as a drug. Plant parts can be brewed as a tea or chewed, and seed pods, commonly known as \"pods\" or \"thorn apples,\" can be eaten. Side effects from ingesting jimson weed include tachycardia, dry mouth, dilated pupils, blurred vision, hallucinations, confusion, combative behavior, and difficulty urinating. Severe toxicity has been associated with coma and seizures, although death is rare. Treatment consists of activated charcoal and gastric lavage. Esmolol or other beta-blocker may be indicated to reduce severe sinus tachycardia. Seizures, severe hypertension, severe hallucinations, and life-threatening arrhythmias are indicators for the use of the anticholinesterase inhibitor, Physostigmine. This article reviews the cases of nine teenagers who were treated in hospitals in the Kanawha Valley after ingesting jimson weed. We hope this article will help alert primary care physicians about the abuse of jimson weed and inform health officials about the need to educate teens about the dangers of this plant.", 
    "132": "Intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin resulted in bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine in guinea pigs. In addition, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) caused a decrease in the relaxation of the lung parenchymal strips induced by the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (isoprenaline), and a reduction in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites in the lung membrane preparation in guinea pigs. Apafant (CAS 105219-56-5, WEB 2086) was effective in the prevention of endotoxin-induced changes, i.e., bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine, a decrease in the relaxation of lung parenchymal strips induced by isoproterenol and a reduction in the number of beta-adrenergic binding sites in the lung membrane preparation in guinea pigs. Ketotifen and ozagrel also prevented the bronchial hyperresponsiveness and endotoxin-induced deterioration of the beta-adrenergic system. No remarkable effect was observed with cromolyn sodium and salbutamol in the bronchial hyperreactivity to histamine induced by endotoxin in guinea pigs. Cromolyn sodium also caused no influence on the down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors.",

The prevalence rates of Parkinson disease and essential tremor are very high, and their diagnoses and treatments are quite important. Recent advances in treating Parkinson disease with anti-parkinsonian medications and essential tremor with beta-adrenergic blockers were presented. Blepharospasms, though uncommon, but occasionally seen in the aged persons, are disabled conditions. The botulinus toxin injections to the orbicularis oculi muscles proved to show dramatic therapeutic effects, greatly contributing to these patients' ADL. The importance of neuroscience in the coming 21st century is also stressed.", 
    "134": "Propranolol is used clinically as a prophylactic drug to prevent oesophageal variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. Vascular hyporesponsiveness is a common characteristic of the portal hypertensive state. The present study aimed to investigate whether chronic administration of propranolol could improve vascular responsiveness in portal hypertensive rats. Portal hypertension was induced by partial portal vein ligation (PVL). Sham-operated rats served as controls. There were four study groups: PVL-propranolol group (portal hypertensive rats receiving propranolol), PVL-vehicle group (portal hypertensive rats receiving saline), sham-propranolol group (sham-operated rats receiving propranolol) and sham-vehicle group (sham-operated rats receiving saline). Propranolol (30 mg kg-1 day-1) or saline was given for 9 days via gastric gavage starting 1 day before ligation and thereafter. Then, the superior mesenteric artery was removed from each group for contractile study after haemodynamic measurement. In portal hypertensive rats, propranolol significantly alleviated the hyperdynamic state, including portal pressure, cardiac index and total peripheral resistance in the treated group compared with the vehicle group. The maximal contractile responses to KCl and vasopressin in mesenteric artery were significantly greater in the sham-vehicle group than in the PVL-vehicle group. Long-term propranolol treatment enhanced the contractile reactivity of mesenteric artery to KCl and vasopressin in PVL rats, and the contractile profiles were corrected towards those in sham-treated animals. In contrast, propranolol treatment decreased heart rate, mean arterial pressure and cardiac index but did not alter the contractile responsiveness of sham-operated rats. These results showed that, in portal vein stenosed rats, long-term treatment with propranolol improved arterial contractile reactivity together with portal pressure reduction. The propranolol effect on vascular reactivity is probably related to haemodynamic improvement, instead of a direct contractile effect on the vasculature.", 
    "135": "Paradigms for the treatment of heart failure have changed substantially over the past several decades. It has been the performance of relatively large, carefully controlled and often mortality endpoint trials that has given us great insight into therapies that are advantageous, disadvantageous, or neutral with respect to outcomes in patients with heart failure. No longer is the care of a patient with ventricular dysfunction and heart failure solely rooted in the prescription of a diuretic and digoxin. Indeed, we have seen a rather radical evolution from this prescription practice to approaches that were thought to be contraindicated at one time, such as beta blocker and vasodilator therapy. Indeed, treatment paradigms today are shifting rapidly toward more complete attenuation of adrenergic processes known to be detrimental in this setting. It is important to review the recent clinical trials that have given us further insight into managing heart failure. Twenty trials published since 1995 have been selected because of the important insight they give us regarding the wide spectrum of therapeutic options available for individuals with heart failure.", 
    "136": "Kaliotoxin (KTX) is a natural peptide blocker of voltage-dependent K+ channels. The 3D structure of a truncated analogue of KTX (Fernandez et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 14256-14263) was determined by NMR spectroscopy and showed significant differences from structures established for other related scorpion toxins. A recent publication with the structure of the complete toxin (Aiyar et al. (1995) Neuron 15, 1169-1181) did not confirm these differences. In this communication we report NMR data for KTX at pH 3.0, 5.5 and 7.2 and the 3D structure obtained from data at pH = 5.5. Complete KTX displays a folding similar to that of other toxins with an alpha-helix and a beta-sheet linked by two disulphide bonds. The pKa of His 34 is anomalously low (4.7-5.2 depending on the buffer) owing to its interaction with two Lys residues (including the essential Lys 27), the charged N-terminus and the side chain of Met 29. Charged residues are placed symmetrically with respect to an axis that approximately coincides with one of the principal components of the moment of inertia of the toxin. His 34, which occupies a well-defined position between two conserved Cys, is located on the centre of a layer of charged groups. Positively and negatively charged residues are found at the same position in related toxins. It is suggested that electrostatic effects modulate the distances between positive charges in flexible side chains, contributing to the fine tuning of the selectivity toward different channel subclasses and that the approximate coincidence between the moment of inertia and the charge axis facilitate the approach of the toxin to the channel. The very low pKa of His 34 implies that it will be completely unprotonated at physiological pH.", 
    "137": "The electrophysiologic actions of epinephrine (10(-9) M, 10(-8) M, and 10(-7) M) were evaluated in canine Purkinje fibers pretreated with the class III antiarrhythmic drugs clofilium (10(-7) M) or d,l-sotalol (10(-6) M). Clofilium and d,l-sotalol prolonged action potential duration at 50% and 90% of repolarization without provoking early afterdepolarization (EAD) or delayed afterdepolarization (DAD). Subsequent administration of epinephrine provoked both bradycardia-dependent EADs and tachycardia-dependent DADs in clofilium-treated Purkinje fibers, with predominantly EADs observed in d,l-sotalol-treated Purkinje fibers. A temporary increase in Ca0(+2) from 1.35 mM to 5 mM suppressed both EADs and DADs. The data demonstrate facilitation of epinephrine-induced EADs and DADs by class III antiarrhythmic drugs. The acute suppression of both EADs and DADs observed following an acute increase in Ca0(+2) suggests inward Na(+)-Ca0(+2) exchange current as a basis for both EADs and DADs observed in the presence of class III antiarrhythmic drugs and epinephrine.", 
    "138": "Capillary electrophoresis has developed into an extremely useful technique for the separation of optical isomers. High efficiencies and the availability of many types of isomer selectors allowing rapid and inexpensive methods development make capillary electrophoresis (CE) an attractive alternative to gas chromatography (GC) and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the determination of chiral purity. In this research the separation of the enantiomers of some chiral pharmaceuticals was investigated using anionic sulphobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrins as isomer selectors. These chiral selectors have a large countercurrent mobility, making them inherently advantageous as selectors as compared to neutral cyclodextrins. The effects of pH, buffer composition and selector concentration on the chiral separation of these compounds was investigated. All of the compounds studied were successfully resolved by the sulphobutyl ether beta-cyclodextrins (SBE-beta-CDs) typically with run times of less than 20 min using low concentrations of the SBE selector (1-5 mM).", 
    "139": "Because the absorption of orally administered drugs depends on intestinal permeability, we have investigated how absorptive capacity varies from the proximal to distal intestine in rats. The effective permeabilities of compounds with a range of physicochemical properties and different absorption mechanisms were estimated by use of a previously validated in-situ, single-pass perfusion model. The low colonic permeabilities of D-glucose and L-dopa indicate the absence or low capacity of the glucose- and amino-acid-transporters in this region. With the exception of the small and moderately lipophilic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, naproxen, for which permeability was maintained throughout the intestine, the passive intestinal permeabilities for hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs were approximately twice as high in the jejunum and ileum as in the colon. These observations are in accord with those made in recent studies. However, the reasons for the high colonic permeability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and results obtained in previous animal experiments demonstrating that the colon is the region of the intestine with the highest absorptive capacity were not fully clarified. These data show that the permeability to hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs decreases along the intestine, whereas it is maintained throughout the intestine for the small and moderately lipophilic naproxen. Further investigations are required to clarify the interplay between membrane composition, fluidity and permeability under various conditions in different absorption models.",

    "143": "This study was undertaken to characterize changes in the tachykinin system induced by hyperoxic exposure and the potential effects on airway contractile responses. We exposed 7-day-old rat pups to either room air or hyperoxia (> 95% O2) for 7 days to assess pulmonary beta-preprotachykinin (beta-PPT) gene expression, substance P (SP) levels, and airway contractile responses to cholinergic stimulation before and after neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor blockade. Lung beta-PPT mRNA expression, lung and tracheal SP levels, and contractile responses to exogenous acetylcholine and electrical field stimulation were measured in vitro in normoxia- and hyperoxia-exposed tracheal cylinders. Hyperoxia caused a 1.1- to 2.6-fold increase in steady-state lung beta-PPT mRNA and a 50 and 32% increase in SP levels of lung and trachea, respectively. In response to cholinergic stimulation, maximal contractile force (Emax) of hyperoxia exposed tracheal muscle was significantly higher than for normoxic controls. Addition of the SP (NK1) receptor blocker CP-99994 (10 microM) decreased sensitivity to electrical field stimulation in both hyperoxic and normoxic trachea without a significant decline in Emax. These data provide evidence for both increased SP production and enhanced maximal contractile responses of hyperoxia-exposed neonatal trachea to cholinergic stimulation. The tachykinin peptide SP does not, however, appear to play a major role in the enhanced airway reactivity associated with hyperoxic lung injury during early postnatal life.",

    "152": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of autonomic stimulation and blockade on noise levels and to compare the noise measurements in the ST and TP segments of the signal-averaged ECG. Five-minute electrocardiographic data were recorded in 14 normal volunteers (8 males and 6 females; mean age 28.5 +/- 5.0 years) on two separate days (day 1-baseline, epinephrine infusion, isoproterenol infusion, beta-blockade, and combined adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade; day 2-baseline, phenylephrine infusion, parasympathetic blockade, and during phenylephrine infusion following atropine). Signal averaging was done off-line on 100 beats and noise was measured in both the ST and TP segments as the standard deviation of voltage in the segment of interest. For all conditions tested, the mean noise level measured in the ST segment (0.46 +/- 0.16 microV) was significantly less than that measured in the TP segment (0.52 +/- 0.24 microV; P = 0.0003), but there was good correlation between the noise measured in the ST and the TP segment (R2 = 0.62, P < 0.0001). Noise increased with isoproterenol infusion and decreased following adrenergic blockade. In addition, day 2 baseline noise was less than baseline noise on day 1. Finally, neither parasympathetic stimulation or blockade nor alpha-adrenergic stimulation significantly affected signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) noise levels. Thus, the data support the notion that enhanced sympathetic tone increases noise levels and beta-adrenergic blockade may decrease noise levels, likely due to effects from muscle sympathetic nerve activity. These findings are important since the target population for the SAECG are patients with myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, which may in turn impact on the reproducibility or technical aspects of the SAECG. In addition, because noise in the ST and TP segments are highly correlated and the noise measured in the ST segment is less than that in the TP segment, uniform adoption of noise measurement in the ST segment seems most appropriate.", 
    "153": "A small percentage of pediatric patients with neurally mediated syncope will have an asystolic response during upright tilt table testing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of asystole during tilt table testing, and to assess the outcome of medical management of such patients. Of 398 patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent syncope between January 1989 and 1994, 18 (4.5%) experienced asystole lasting > or = 5 seconds during baseline tilt test. Patients had experienced a mean of four episodes of syncope, with a mean age at the time of tilt test of 11.1 +/- 4.0 years. The median duration of asystole was 10 seconds (range 5-40 s). Treatment was individualized to increased fluids and salt intake (3 patients), metoprolol (8 patients), pseudoephedrine (4 patients), disopyramide (1 patient), or combination therapy with fludrohydrocortisone (2 patients). During a median duration of follow-up of 31 months, no additional syncope was experienced by 78% of patients. Recurrent syncope in 4 patients was associated with either noncompliance or discontinuation of therapy in 3 patients; in 1 patient, increasing the dose of metoprolol was effective in preventing recurrences. We conclude that young patients with recurrent syncope and asystole during tilt test may be safely and effectively managed with pharmacological therapy, without resorting to pacemaker implantation.", 
    "154": "We tested the hypothesis that the mechanical workload of the heart inversely determines the rate of myocardial edema formation in an isolated, perfused rat heart preparation. Heart rate (HR) was varied in three groups by pacing at 125 (HR125), 250 (HR250), or 350 beats/min (HR350). Left ventricular pressure (LVP) was varied in two additional groups by pacing at 250 beats/min and with the addition of either epinephrine (Epi) or propranolol (Pro) to the perfusate. In five otherwise identical groups, variation of coronary vascular resistance was minimized by adenosine. Myocardial water content (MWC) varied significantly and inversely with HR in the HR125, HR250, and HR350 groups. MWC of the HR250 group was significantly less than that of the Pro group but did not differ from the Epi group. However, when adenosine was used, MWC had significant inverse relationships with HR and LVP. We concluded that the mechanical workload of the heart inversely determines the rate and degree of myocardial edema formation in this isolated heart preparation, and both HR and LVP are determinants of this relationship.", 
    "155": "The aim of the study was to test whether circadian and ultradian variations of cardiac output (CO) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) differ from those in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Twenty-four-hour beat-to-beat recordings of CO (by electromagnetic flow probe) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were performed in the absence and presence of cardiac autonomic blockade with metoprolol and atropine methylnitrate. Ultradian variability was analyzed by spectral analysis on beat-to-beat data series (high-frequency range) and on averaged minute-to-minute data series (low-frequency range). In general, circadian and ultradian rhythms of CO were similar in SHR (n = 10) and WKY (n = 9). Values of CO were high during the dark and low during the light period, whereas total peripheral resistance was highest during the light period. During cardiac autonomic blockade, relative differences between averaged values of CO over the dark and light periods were reduced. High-frequency spectral power of CO was mainly confined to fluctuations related to respiration and was not influenced by cardiac autonomic blockade. At low-frequency ranges, power spectra of CO lacked a dominant oscillator but showed 1/f characteristics. During cardiac autonomic blockade, low-frequency spectral power of CO fell without changing the 1/f characteristics. These findings suggest that dynamic control of CO is not altered in SHR and that autonomic effects on CO are frequency dependent. In most frequency ranges, the relative variation of CO was higher than that of MAP. Thus, over 24 h in both adult SHR and WKY, MAP is controlled within a more narrow range than CO.", 
    "156": "1. We have studied the difference in receptor binding activity between partial and full beta2-adrenoceptor agonists and the abilities of the agonists to interact with Ser204 and Ser207 in the fifth transmembrane region of the beta2-adrenoceptor, amino acid residues that are important for activation of the beta2-adrenoceptor. 2. In the binding study with [125I]-iodocyanopindolol, the Ki values of (+/-)-salbutamol, (+/-)-salmeterol, TA-2005 and (-)-isoprenaline for the beta2-adrenoceptor expressed in COS-7 cell membranes were 3340, 21.0, 12.0 and 904 nM, respectively. The beta1/beta2 selectivity of these agonists was in the order of (+/-)-salmeterol (332 fold) > TA-2005 (52.8) > (+/-)-salbutamol (6.8) > (-)-isoprenaline (1.1), and the beta3-/beta2-adrenoceptor selectivity of these agonists was in the order of TA-2005 (150 fold) > (+/-)-salmeterol (88.6) > (+/-)-salbutamol (10.4) > (-)-isoprenaline (3.2). 3. The maximal activation of adenylyl cyclase by stimulation of the beta1-, beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors by TA-2005 was 32, 100 and 100% of that by (-)-isoprenaline, respectively, indicating that TA-2005 is a full agonist at the beta2- and beta3-adrenoceptors and a partial agonist at the beta1-adrenoceptor. (+/-)-Salbutamol and (+/-)-salmeterol were partial agonists at both beta1- (8% and 9% of (-)-isoprenaline) and beta2- (83% and 74% of (-)-isoprenaline) adrenoceptors. 4. The affinities of full agonists, TA-2005 and (-)-isoprenaline, were markedly decreased by substitution of Ala for Ser204 (S204A) of the beta2-adrenoceptor, whereas this substitution slightly reduced the affinities of partial agonists, (+/-)-salbutamol and (+/-)-salmeterol. Although the affinities of full agonists for the S207A-beta2-adrenoceptor were decreased, those of partial agonists for the S207A-beta2-adrenoceptor were essentially the same as for the wild type receptor. 5. The constitutively active mutant (L266S, L272A) of the beta2-adrenoceptor had an increased affinity for all four agonists. The affinities of full agonists were decreased by substitution of Ser204 of the constitutively active mutant, whereas the degree of decrease was smaller than that caused by the substitution of the wild type receptor. Although the affinities of (+/-)-salbutamol and (+/-)-salmeterol for the S207A-beta2-adrenoceptor were essentially the same as those for the wild type beta2-adrenoceptor, the affinities of (+/-)-salbutamol and (+/-)-salmeterol for the constitutively active beta2-adrenoceptor were decreased by substitution of Ser207. 6. These results suggest that Ser204 and Ser207 of the wild type and constitutively active beta2-adrenoceptors differentially interacted with beta2-selective agonists.",

Lipids were measured before and 30 and 60 min after the commencement of continuous intravenous administration of adrenaline (0.06 microgram/kg per min) or saline in pentobarbital-anaesthetized rabbits. 2. Adrenaline infusion significantly increased plasma free fatty acid (P < 0.05) and noradrenaline (NA) levels (P < 0.05) in vehicle-treated control rabbits, but not in adriamycin-treated rabbits. However, adrenaline had no effect on plasma total cholesterol, free cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, triglyceride or phospholipid levels. 3. Pretreatment with propranolol almost completely inhibited increased plasma free fatty acid and NA levels associated with adrenaline infusion, suggesting that adrenaline increases plasma free fatty acid and NA levels via the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors in vehicle-treated rabbits. 4. It is suggested that both the production of plasma free fatty acids and the release of NA via the activation of beta-adrenoceptors is reduced in rabbits with adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy. This may be related to the down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors caused by elevated plasma NA levels induced by cardiac failure.",

Cocaine's principal effects on the cardiovascular system are mediated via alpha-adrenergic stimulation and include (1) an increase in the determinants of myocardial oxygen demand (heart rate and systemic arterial pressure), and (2) a concomitant decrease in myocardial oxygen supply (caused by vasoconstriction of the epicardial coronary arteries). beta-adrenergic blocking agents may exacerbate cocaine-induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction, thereby increasing the magnitude of myocardial ischemia. In contrast, nitroglycerin and verapamil reverse cocaine-induced hypertension and coronary arterial vasoconstriction; therefore, they are the agents of choice in treating patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.",

A biopsy of the tumor showed a fibromatosis with medullary compression, treated by antimitotics until 3 months of age. At the age of 4, the mass had disappeared but severe scoliosis was present. This in utero exposure to atenolol drew our attention because the retroperitoneal localization of the tumor is similar to that of fibroses reported in adults after exposure to atenolol and for other reasons: transplacental carcinogenesis has been demonstrated in humans, at least for diethylstilboestrol, atenolol crosses the placental barrier, the drug was taken during nearly the whole pregnancy, and retroperitoneal fibromatosis is exceptional as a neonatal tumour.",

Open studies suggest that, for selective serotonergic re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, this latency may be reduced when the drug is taken with the 5HT1A receptor blocker pindolol. We have undertaken a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind trial of augmentation of the selective SSRI antidepressant paroxetine in combination with pindolol. All our patients (n = 54; mean age 36 [range 19-65]) met criteria for major depression and received a standard dose (20 mg o.d.) of paroxetine plus, randomly, either pindolol (2.5 mg t.d.s.) or placebo for six weeks. We examined personality variables in 48 consecutive subjects according to a short version (TCI-125) of Cloninger et al's self-rated Temperament and Character Inventory (Cloninger et al., 1994) and correlated the results with clinical responses in the trial. The results suggest that personality can influence clinical outcome. After the double blind period patients were offered paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg for up to 6 months. Twenty-six patients took this up. The results suggest that high scores in the temperament dimension of Reward Dependence and low scores in the temperament dimension of Harm Avoidance had a better outcome at 6 weeks. Patients who had received paroxetine and pindolol during the trial and who reported high Novelty Seeking and low Harm Avoidance scores had a better outcome at 6 weeks and 6 months. We suggest that temperament factors may influence outcome of antidepressant treatment."
