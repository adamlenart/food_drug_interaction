    "0": "Sotalol (STL) is an amphoteric, chiral beta-adrenergic blocking drug useful in the treatment of both hypertension and ventricular arrhythmias. In the human and rat, STL enantiomers are predominantly cleared from the body by the kidney as intact drug. The renal clearance (Clr) of STL enantiomers substantially exceeds the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the human and rat. In this report, the hypothesis that STL enantiomers are excreted by an active renal transport system was investigated in the rat by coadministering racemic STL (10 mg kg-1) with cimetidine, an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic cations. To compare the effects of short-term and sustained cimetidine exposure on STL enantiomer disposition, cimetidine was administered either as a single bolus (30 mg kg-1, n = 7) immediately prior to the STL dose, or as a 30 mg kg-1 bolus plus a 50 mg kg-1 infusion over the 6 h study period (n = 7). Blood and urine samples were collected over 6 h, during which time anaesthesia was maintained via intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital. Cimetidine bolus and cimetidine infusion reduced STL enantiomer Clr by 43 and 59%, respectively, compared with respective saline controls. Significant stereoselectivity was observed in the cimetidine infusion group: systemic clearance, Clr (R > S), and AUC (S > R), although the magnitude of stereoselectivity was less than 5%. This study supports the hypothesis that STL enantiomers are predominantly cleared from the rat via a renal cationic transport mechanism and that this system can be competitively inhibited by the presence of cimetidine.",

    "2": "Three multicenter, double-masked, parallel trials were completed in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension of 3 months' treatment duration. Studies 1 and 2 were three-arm comparisons of betaxolol, pilocarpine, and a fixed combination, each used 3 times daily. Study 3 was a two-arm study of the fixed combination with and without a surfactant, used twice daily. In all studies, there was a 1-month runin period with betaxolol 0.25% suspension given twice daily. There were 182 patients in Study 1, 186 patients in Study 2, and 166 patients in Study 3.", 
    "3": "In all 3 studies, approximately 10% to 15% of patients treated with pilocarpine or the combination therapy were terminated from further participation because of typical pilocarpine side effects (eg, blurred vision, headache). In studies 1 and 2, there was a mean reduction in intraocular pressure from a betaxolol baseline of approximately 3 to 4 mmHg. Patients continuing on betaxolol alone or randomly assigned to pilocarpine alone experienced a mean reduction of 1 to 2 mm Hg. Overall, the combination was approximately 2 mmHg more effective than either betaxolol or pilocarpine alone. In Study 3, the two betaxolol combinations had equivalent efficacy.", 
    "4": "In patients requiring more than one ocular hypotensive agent, the combination of betaxolol and pilocarpine in a single formulation appears to be an effective and relatively safe agent. The use of this combination agent promises the potential for enhanced patient convenience.",

    "6": "Dapiprazole 0.5% eye drops were administered 3 times daily as adjunctive therapy to 16 pigmentary glaucoma patients in addition to timolol 0.5% eye drops twice daily. Computerized tonography was performed before and 3, 12 and 36 months after dapiprazole treatment. Sixteen sex- and age-matched pigmentary glaucoma patients treated with timolol 0.5% eye drops alone were used as a control group.", 
    "7": "After 36 months of follow-up, the dapiprazole-treated group showed a significant increase in total outflow facility (C, from 0.17 +/- 0.04 to 0.22 +/- 0.07 ml min-1 mm Hg-1; p = 0.010, paired t test) and Po/C ratio (Q) significantly decreased from 113.39 +/- 31.02 to 89.22 +/- 51.66 (p = 0.036, paired t test).", 
    "8": "Our results show that the introduction of dapiprazole in the therapy of pigmentary glaucoma may be useful in the long-term management of these patients. Its mechanism of action is likely to be due to iridoplegia; in fact, a decrease in the shedding of pigment occurs, with time, the outflow facility increases and the pigment clearance from the trabecular meshwork is enhanced.", 
    "9": "We investigated the effects of antihypertensive therapy on serum levels of interleukin-4 using InterTest-4 ELISA in 25 preeclamptic women; 14 were placed on treatment, while 11 were not. Comparison was made with 14 non-preeclamptic pregnant controls. Interleukin-4 levels were significantly lower in the controls than in the treated preeclamptic women (p < 0.001): 68.6 +/- 10.9 versus 106.1 +/- 13.2, 64.7 +/- 9.6 versus 119.8 +/- 11.4, 90.2 +/- 9.1 versus 124.3 +/- 15.7, and 65.6 +/- 3.6 versus 109.7 +/- 11.4 pg/ml, during antepartum, early intrapartum, late intrapartum and postpartum periods, respectively. No significant differences were detected between the therapy and no therapy subgroups (p > 0.05). This shows that antihypertensive therapy has no effect on interleukin-4 levels.", 
    "10": "Involvement of the adrenergic mediator system in central mechanisms of hyperbaric nitrogen narcosis or the high pressure nervous syndrome (NSHP) produced by nitrogen or heliox gas mixtures under increased pressure was studied in mice and rabbit experiments with the use of pharmacological substances-analyzers. Accumulated data are indicative of lack of a significant role of the adrenergic system in the NSHP genesis and a protective effect of activation of the central but not peripheric adrenergic mediation in development of the behavioural and electrophysiological symptomatics of nitrogen narcosis. Mechanisms of NSHP and nitrogen narcosis and possible principles of pharmacological correction are under discussion.", 
    "11": "In the ELSA trial, the effects of lacidipine-based treatment and beta-blocker (atenolol)-based treatment on the development and progression of carotid wall alterations are assessed in hypertensive patients. The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of change in the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall, measured with B-mode ultrasound. About 2300 hypertensive patients have been recruited and randomized to either of the antihypertensive agents. Baseline data for 1965 patients are available, showing a high prevalence of carotid wall lesions: about 82% of the subjects have an intima-media thickness > or = 1.3 mm, defined as plaque in the ELSA protocol; 16% of the subjects have intima-media thickening (> or = 1.0 mm, < 1.3 mm) and only about 1% have normal carotid artery walls. Analysis of demographic data and risk factor prevalence in ELSA patients, and comparison of these preliminary observations with data from other intervention or observational studies indicate that high blood pressure is a very important risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis.", 
    "12": "The European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) is a multinational interventional clinical trial aimed at determining the antiatherosclerotic effects of Lacidipine, a calcium antagonist, when compared to atenolol, a beta-blocker, on the carotid arteries of 2300 cardiovascular asymptomatic patients with moderately high blood pressure. Quantitative B-mode ultrasound imaging is being used to measure the intima-media thickness of a standardized section of the carotid arteries including the distal common, bifurcation, and proximal internal carotids. Prospective investigations of large samples of population using ultrasonographic endpoints rely heavily on the precision and reproducibility of the method. Therefore, specific quality control protocols are required to determine and monitor cross-sectional and longitudinal stability of the measurement reproducibility. In ELSA, the ultrasound methodology was specifically designed to include a set of procedures to quality control the critical components of measurement variation including instrumentation, and ultrasound operators, i.e. sonographers and readers. The ELSA clinical trial will provide the largest set of prospective quality control data on the use of quantitative B-mode ultrasound imaging.", 
    "13": "Lambda-carrageenan, a linear high molecular weight sulfated polysaccharide, has been employed as a chiral selector in capillary electrophoresis for the separation of enantiomers of weakly basic pharmaceutical compounds. The racemic compounds that were enantioresolved included propranolol, pindolol, tryptophanol, laudanosine and laudanosoline. In addition, the diastereomeric pair of cinchonine and cinchonidine were also resolved. Method conditions such as buffer pH, electrolyte concentration, column temperature, and chiral selector concentration were found to be important for improvement of enantioselectivity.", 
    "14": "A negatively charged derivative of beta-cyclodextrin, sulphobutyl ether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-beta-CD), was examined as a chiral mobile phase additive in reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for the enantiomeric resolution of the calcium channel blocker rac-amlodipine. Theoretical and practical aspects are discussed for setting up a central composite design applicable to any analytical method. These include the correct location of factor points for maintaining orthogonality within the design and the augmentation of centrepoint experiments to allow a larger factor space by increasing the distance of axial star points. Optimised separation was achieved using a reverse-phase column with eluent comprising: acetonitrile (ACN)-potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 3.93) containing 2.66 mM SBE-beta-CD (26.5:73.5% v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. This yielded a Kaiser peak separation index, Pi = 0.96, at tR2 = 52 min with satisfactory reproducibility, relative standard deviation values: tR1, 0.39%; tR2, 0.47% (n = 5). These experimental results were in excellent agreement with those predicted by the SAS software package for a chromatographic response function model. Multiple regression analysis in four dimensions, with three response models based on Rs, Pi, and a function of Pi, produced response surfaces which revealed zones of optimum robustness and illustrated the interactions involved between the key chromatographic factors. Putative proposals for a mechanism involving the interaction of each of the positively charged enantiomers with the negatively charged cyclodextrin are also discussed. These examine the possibility of ion-pairing and inclusion phenomena to account for the excellent resolution observed.", 
    "15": "The presence of beta-adrenoceptor in a rat lung membrane preparation was confirmed by stereoselective competition of enantiomers of epinephrine with labeled iodocyanopindolol. The receptor-rich protein fraction, when combined with the pharmacologically active (-)-epinephrine, exhibited specific changes in the 205-220 nm region of circular dichroism spectra, indicating that the receptor helices may be perturbed. The (+)-epinephrine combined with the lung protein produced little or no change of the spectra. Bovine serum albumin, when combined with either enantiomer of epinephrine, produced nonstereoselective alterations of the spectra. Thus, the data provide important evidence for the higher intrinsic pharmacologic activity of the natural (-)-epinephrine over the unnatural (+)-enantiomer.", 
    "16": "To determine the cardiovascular responses to beta-blockade and cold air stress, six males were randomly exposed at rest to three drug conditions (placebo, nonselective beta-blockade (propranolol), and selective beta-blockade (atenolol)) in each of two environments (5 and 25 degrees C) for 1 h. Cardiac output was lower on beta-blockade than on the placebo in both the 25 and 5 degrees C environments. Cardiac output on propranolol (4.2 +/- 0.3 L.min-1) at 5 degrees C was lower than on atenolol (4.7 +/- 0.4 L.min-1, p < 0.05). Mean arterial pressure was greater (p < 0.05) at 5 than 25 degrees C for each drug condition. There was no drug effect on total peripheral resistance at 25 degrees C. At 5 degrees C, total peripheral resistance on both beta-blockers (propranolol 1942.7 +/- 169.9 dyn.s.cm-5 (1 dyn = 10 microN); atenolol 1706.7 +/- 160.0 dyn.s.cm-5) was higher (p < 0.05) than on the placebo (1485.3 +/- 111.8 dyn.s.cm-5). Total peripheral resistance was also higher on propranolol than atenolol (p < 0.05). In conclusion, cold air stress interacts with beta-blockade to elevate total peripheral resistance by decreasing cardiac output while having little effect on mean arterial pressure. These effects are greater on nonselective than on selective blockade.", 
    "17": "Recently, it has become clear that the best way to reduce the mortality related to a variceal bleeding is to prevent it. Since however not all patients will bled, a way to predict a variceal hemorrhage is therefore urgently needed. The current endoscopic scores for the prediction of variceal bleeding are based on rather subjective markers. The present experimental work added the measured variceal pressure to this scoring systems, but a large number of patients should prospectively be evaluated to allow development of a model based on numerical data. Medical treatment of variceal bleeding, both to prevent and to stop the bleeding, became the treatment of choice for the majority of our cirrhotic patients. Our present investigations demonstrated that the non-invasive measurement of variceal pressure with the endoscopic gauge represent a reliable technique to assess the effect of drug treatment for portal hypertension both in acute and chronic conditions. Non invasive variceal pressure measurement may play therefore a crucial role in the future care of patients with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. Developments with regard to primary or secondary prevention of bleeding will depend on further insight to be gained in the pathogenesis of the development of varices in a variety of experimental models and in patients. The mechanisms of action and the effect on portal hypertension of a series of drugs has further to be investigated. Experience gained till now in the cardiovascular domain will greatly speed up this process but fundamental research on neurohumeral processes involved will be further essential.", 
    "18": "Two timolol preparations, a gel and an eyedrop with a thickening agent, and one commercial eyedrop without a thickening agent, were studied in rabbits. After topical administration of these three preparations in rabbits, aqueous humor was withdrawn and the proteins removed from the samples by precipitation with acetonitrile. Timolol concentrations were determined directly by an HPLC method. The HPLC mobile phase was composed of methanol and 5 mM d-camphorsulfonic acid (in 1% acetic acid) with a ratio of 49:51 (v/v). A reversed phase C18 column was used to separate samples with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min and a UV detector set at 284 nm. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to fit the aqueous humor level for determining the drainage (kd) and absorption rate constants (ka) in the precorneal area as well as the elimination rate constant (ke) of timolol in aqueous humor. For ka +kd, the eyedrop without a thickening agent had the highest value (0.160 min-1), followed by the eyedrop with a thickening agent (0.030 min-1), and the gel had the lowest value (0.009 min-1). It suggests that the gel has a longer retention time in eyes to improve ocular bioavailability and decrease side effects. The AUC0 approximately infinity for the aqueous humor profile with time coordinates were 4142, 2974, and 1604 micrograms min/mL, for the gel, the eyedrop with a thickening agent, and the eyedrop without a thickening agent, respectively. In another study, timolol preparations were also topically administered in alpha-chymotrypsin-induced glaucoma rabbits for determining the lowering effect on intraocular pressure (IOP). The durations of depressing IOP for the gel, the eyedrop with a thickening agent, and the eyedrop without a thickening agent were 24, 14 and 10 hrs, respectively. Thus, the gel preparation has a longer duration and a higher ocular bioavailability which might be further developed in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "19": "The putative M1 muscarinic receptor agonist McN-A-343 evoked a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) when administered intravenously to conscious freely-moving rats pretreated with the ganglionic nicotinic receptor antagonist pentolinium. A tachycardia accompanied the increase in MAP which was blocked by the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol. The increase in MAP was attenuated by the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin combined with the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine. Adding propranolol to alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade uncovered a latent pressor response. Replacing prazosin with benextramine (which blocks NPY in addition to alpha-adrenergic receptors) attenuated the pressor response unmasked by propranolol. This attenuation was comparable to that provided by benextramine of the pressor response to intravenous administration of NPY. Adrenal demedullation only slightly attenuated the pressor response while having no effect on the tachycardia. The catecholamine depletor guanethidine greatly attenuated the McN-A-343-evoked increase in MAP and heart rate. The combination of adrenal demedullation and guanethidine did not further attenuate the increase in MAP but did provide better attenuation of the tachycardia than guanethidine alone. These results show that McN-A-343-evokes an increase in MAP and heart rate of conscious freely-moving rats primarily by causing the release of catecholamines, and possibly NPY, from sympathetic neurons with the adrenal glands playing a minor role.", 
    "20": "We previously reported that aqueous extract of Larrea divaricata Cav. had an antiproliferative activity upon tumoral lymphoid cells (BW 5147), without affecting normal immunity. To determine the probable mechanism of the inhibitory action of the extract upon cell growth, the participation of intracellular signals involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation, namely the activation of adenylate cyclase system was studied. The production of cyclic 3', 5 adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in presence and absence of extract was analized. The extract increased the cAMP levels, but neither the cAMP production nor the inhibitory effect of the extract on proliferation were blocked by a beta adrenergic receptor antagonist (propranolol) or by histaminergic receptor antagonists (cimetidine and mepyramine). So, we concluded that the antiproliferative activity of the extract of BW 5147 cells would be mediated by an increase in cAMP intracellular levels no related to the activation of the membrane receptors here studied. In parallel, the extract was administered to a pregnant rat with a spontaneous mammarian carcinoma and \"in vivo\" antitumoral activity was found.", 
    "21": "Bradykinin and beta-endorphin increases during acute pancreatitis are thought to contribute to the development of hypotension and myocardial depression in acute pancreatitis. beta-Endorphin release is mediated by trypsin-like enzymes and bradykinin from the pituitary gland. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of a long-acting bradykinin receptor antagonist on bradykinin and beta-endorphin release and on hemodynamic changes during acute pancreatitis. Pancreatitis was induced by the injection of autologous bile mixed with trypsin into the main pancreatic duct after ligation of the accessory duct. Serum bradykinin and plasma beta-endorphin levels and cardiovascular function were measured. Twelve dogs (control group) were given 10 ml/kg/h of lactate Ringer's solution intravenously beginning 1 h before the induction of pancreatitis and continuing throughout the experiments. Six dogs received an intravenous infusion of 0.6 mg/kg/h of a new bradykinin receptor antagonist, HOE 140, D-Arg-[Hyp3, Thi5, D-Tic, Oic8]-bradykinin, in lactate Ringer's solution soon after the induction of pancreatitis. Six of twelve dogs in the control group, and none of the six dogs in the bradykinin receptor antagonist group, died during the experiments. Serum bradykinin levels in both groups increased until 1 h after the induction of pancreatitis, but thereafter the levels in the bradykinin receptor antagonist group decreased gradually until 5 h after induction, and levels were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Plasma beta-endorphin levels in the control group increased significantly, to 291.8 pg/ml (+/- 6.6 SEM) 5 h after the induction of pancreatitis, from the mean levels of 47.8 pg/ml before the induction of pancreatitis, while the mean beta-endorphin level in the bradykinin receptor antagonist group did not increase after the induction of pancreatitis. Infusion of the bradykinin receptor antagonist improved survival rates, hypotension, myocardial depression, and plasma lactate, suggesting that the bradykinin receptor antagonist inhibited the release of bradykinin and beta-endorphin, which contributed to the clinical improvement.", 
    "22": "Parameters of antioxidant defense including superoxide dismutase, catalase and spontaneous chemiluminescence were studied in 68 patients with ischemic heart disease and 20 control patients. The above parameters decreased with the disease aggravation. Conventional therapy has improved antioxidant defense, the effect being dependent on effect of therapy irrespective of its variant.", 
    "23": "The correlation between dynamic surface properties of drug molecules and drug absorption in two common in vitro models of the intestinal wall (Caco-2 monolayers and rat intestinal segments) has been investigated. A homologous series of beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists were used as model compounds. Dynamic molecular surface properties, considering all low-energy conformations, of the compounds were calculated. The flexibility of the molecules was studied by molecular mechanics calculations (MM2) and the van der Waals' (vdW), and water accessible surface areas were calculated and averaged according to a Boltzmann distribution. Excellent correlations were obtained between the dynamic polar vdW surface areas and cell permeabilities in Caco-2 cells and rat ileum (r2 = 0.99 and 0.92, respectively). These correlations were stronger than those between calculated octanol/buffer partition coefficients (log Doct,7.4) and permeability (r2 = 0.80 and 0.73, respectively). Moreover, the calculated log Doct,7.4 values failed to rank the permeability coefficients through Caco-2 monolayers and rat ileum in the correct order. The results indicate that dynamic polar surface area is a promising alternative model for the prediction of oral drug absorption.", 
    "24": "Controlled release ocular inserts have been found to increase the amount of drug which is absorbed into the aqueous humour when compared to eyedrops. Systemic absorption following delivery using a controlled release insert has been found to be dependent on the release rate of the insert. The objective of this study was to determine if ocular inserts affect drug absorption into other ocular tissues such as the conjunctiva and iris-ciliary body. Ocular absorption studies were performed using albino rabbits and ethylene-vinyl acetate controlled release devices containing timolol maleate. A compartmental model previously developed to simulate ocular absorption following eyedrop administration was modified and used to simulate these experiments. The conjunctival absorption coefficient calculated by the model and the AUC of the conjunctiva per mumol of delivered drug were found to be 2.7 and 42 times higher, respectively, for the ocular insert as compared to eyedrop administration. The increased conjunctiva absorption was likely the result of reduced tear mixing, which caused a high local concentration of timolol between the insert and the conjunctiva. The AUC of the iris-ciliary body per mumol of delivered drug was found to be 24 times higher for the ocular inserts as compared to eyedrop administration. The AUC of the iris-ciliary body was found to be 1.4 times higher than the AUC of the aqueous humour for eyedrop administration, but 9 times greater for delivery via the ocular inserts. Thus, the increased absorption into the iris-ciliary body and aqueous humour observed for ocular inserts is partially the result of an increase in the amount of drug which enters these tissues via penetration across the conjunctiva and sclera.",

    "26": "This article reviews data concerning the action of opioidergic and monoaminergic system on LHRH secretion. Generally, in anestrous ewes beta-endorphin and/or corticoliberin significantly change extracellular concentrations of monoamine metabolites in the MBH-ME, but in estrous ewes both beta-endorphin and CRF alters also dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin levels. Responses of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic system in the MBH-ME to naloxone or CRF-antagonist depend, to a large degree, on the phase of reproduction. In anestrous ewes subjected to stressful stimuli an opiate receptor blocker, naloxone, and CRF-antagonist attenuate the stress - induced activity of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic system in the MBH-ME; in non-stressed animals they suppress only serotoninergic system activity in this structure. No clear explanation can be offered now for either differences in response of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic system in the MBH to beta-endorphin and CRF in various periods of reproduction or for differences in the responses of these systems to CRF antagonist and naloxone in non-stressed and stressed ewes. It has been suggested that the responses in monoaminergic system activity are highly dependent upon the physiological state of the animal and that beta-endorphin and corticoliberin may indirectly modulate LHRH and other hypothalamic hormone secretion by monoaminergic systems.", 
    "27": "Various pharmacological strategies are currently being sought to enhance the efficacy of thrombolysis after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Apart from the use of new thrombolytic agents, novel anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, attention has recently been focused on agents such as the calcium channel blockers (calcium antagonists) traditionally used (prior to the thrombolytic era) for secondary prevention after an AMI. In this context, although calcium channel blockers have not been definitively proven to have any benefit with regard to all-cause mortality or subsequent infarctions, diltiazem has been shown to reduce cardiac mortality, recurrent nonfatal infarction and myocardial ischaemia after non-Q-wave AMI. These benefits have been linked to the drug's effect of lowering heart rate. Since both non-Q-wave AMI and the AMI treated with thrombolytic therapy result in early reperfusion and clinical manifestations of 'incomplete infarction', and are characterised by a similar high incidence of ischaemic complications, it is plausible to hypothesise that prophylactic calcium channel blocker administration to AMI patients post-thrombolysis might decrease the cumulative occurrence of reinfarction and refractory ischaemia during long term follow-up. With this in mind, the Incomplete INfarction Trial of European Research Collaborators Evaluating Prognosis Post-Thrombolysis with Tildiem was initiated in September 1994. This represents the first prospective study to investigate the efficacy of a calcium channel blocker (long-acting diltiazem 300 mg/day) administered as adjunctive therapy with aspirin 160 mg/day in up to 920 patients with an uncomplicated first AMI receiving early thrombolytic therapy. The primary trial objective is to assess the efficacy of blinded therapy on the 6-month cumulative occurrence of a combined clinical end-point (cardiac death, recurrent non-fatal infarction, medically refractory ischaemia)-an end-point identical to that utilised in the assessment of diltiazem in non-Q-wave AMI.", 
    "28": "In human heart failure downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors and upregulation of Gi-protein alpha-subunits (Gi alpha) results desensitization of the myocardial beta-adrenergic signal transduction pathway and reduced positive inotropic effects of catecholamines. Metoprolol treatment has been shown to restore the reduced beta-adrenoceptor density in dilated cardiomyopathy. The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether metoprolol also decreases the elevated inhibitory Gi alpha levels in patients suffering from congestive heart failure.",

Nine controls were treated with conventional therapy only [diuretics, digitalis, nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors], and nine received the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol in addition (mean 98 +/- 12 mg daily).", 
    "30": "In biopsies from patients treated with metoprolol, Gi alpha significantly decreased to 74% of predrug value and total beta-adrenoceptor increased by a selective increase in beta 1-adrenoceptors (44.7 vs 34.0 fmol mg-1 protein).

    "33": "Phenotyping for CYP2D6 activity was done using debrisoquine and metoprolol as probe drugs by measuring the urinary metabolic ratio (MR) of parent drug to metabolite concentration ratios. Genotyping was done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and sequencing analyses with respect to CYP2D6 variants of interest.", 
    "34": "Phenotyping with debrisoquine revealed two poor metabolisers (PMs), whereas 5 subjects out of 94 were PMs using metoprolol as probe drug. Genotypes predictive of the poor metaboliser status were observed for the two subjects who were PMs with both probe drugs, whereas no mutations could explain the PM phenotype for metoprolol among the three remaining subjects, a fact possibly explained by lack of compliance in metoprolol intake. There was a moderate correlation of 0.67 between the debrisoquine and metoprolol metabolic ratios in the 89 subjects who were extensive metabolisers for both probe drugs. The median values for the metabolic ratios for debrisoquine and metoprolol as probe drugs were 1.00 and 1.35, respectively, which are higher than those observed in Caucasian populations. This is indicative of a decreased capacity for metabolism of CYP2D6 substrates by Zimbabweans compared to Caucasians. Evaluation of the DNA samples for the known allelic variants CYP2D6A, CYP2D6B, CYP2D6C, CYP2D6D or CYP2D6Ch1 yielded no explanation for these results.", 
    "35": "The contribution of the individual enantiomers ([+]-[R]- and [-]-[S]-propranolol) to rac-propranolol intoxication was studied in anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing (SB) rats and artificially ventilated (AV) rats and rabbits. In the SB rat, propranolol (30 mg.kg-1.h-1 i.v.) decreased heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure and caused hypoventilation, serious hypoxaemia, respiratory acidosis, and death by respiratory arrest. Survival time (ST) in the (+)-(R)-propranolol group (ST 91 +/- 5 min) was significantly longer than in the rac-propranolol group (ST. 68 +/- 6 min). In AV rats and rabbits toxic doses of rac-, (-)-(S)- and (+)-(R)-propranolol, 30 mg.kg-1.h-1 and 15 mg.kg-1.h-1 i.v., respectively, induced comparable effects on haemodynamic variables as in the SB rat. Artificial ventilation lengthened ST by a factor of three to four in rats. In the AV rat, ST's were not significantly different between the rac-, (-)-(S)- and (+)-(R)-propranolol groups. In the rabbit, as in the SB rat, ST in the (+)-(R)-propranolol group was significantly longer than ST's in the rac- and (-)-(S)-propranolol groups. The acute respiratory acidosis in SB rats and the prolonged ST in AV rats suggest that respiratory failure is the primary and cardiovascular failure the secondary cause of death in propranolol intoxication. The potentiation of the toxic effect of the enantiomers observed after dosing the racemate instead of the pure enantiomers could not be explained by a stereoselective difference in plasma propranolol concentration.",

Head-up tilt table test with isoproterenol was abnormal. No important abnormality was found in sinus or atrioventricular nodal functions. It was postulated that the syncope was due to exaggerated left ventricular baroreflex response, probably aggravated by the increased vagal tone in an endurance runner. The patient was given a beta-adrenergic blocker, and a pacemaker was implanted because of the profound cardio-inhibitory response. The arguments for this approach are discussed.", 
    "41": "Eye disease and cardiovascular disease frequently coexist. As a result, cardiologists and ophthalmologists often treat the same patients. Among ophthalmologists it is well known that topical ophthalmic medications are capable of producing serious cardiovascular effects, including congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and death. However, cardiologists may not be aware of these potential complications. This article reviews the cardiovascular effects of commonly prescribed topical ocular medications and describes important contraindications to their use in patients with cardiovascular disease. Cardiologists, by making themselves and their patients more aware of the cardiovascular effects of topical ocular medications, may be able to avoid the adverse and potentially fatal complications of these agents.", 
    "42": "It was previously reported that selection for differences in the hypothermic effects to the selective 5-HT-1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, occurred rapidly, with very substantial differences present by the fourth generation. The present communication summarizes the findings from the next five generations of selection and from behavioral and other functional studies on these rats. The rats which were more sensitive to 8-OH-DPAT (High DPAT Sensitive-HDS) exhibited decreases in temperature of 4 degrees C or more and the distribution did not overlap with that of the rats which were less sensitive to 8-OH-DPAT (Low DPAT Sensitive-LDS) which exhibited decreases in temperature of 1.5 degrees C or less. The randomly bred control group (Random DPAT Sensitive-RDS) exhibited intermediate temperature decreases (means of 1.6-1.8 degrees C), with time overlap with the distributions of the selected groups. Pretreatment with pindolol, a 5-HT-1A antagonist, reduced the hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT, but pretreatment with ritanserin, a 5-HT-7 and 5-HT-2A/C antagonist, had no effect, confirming that the hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT is mediated predominantly by 5-HT-1A receptors. The HDS rats were less mobile in a forced swim test and drank more saccharin solution in a two-bottle choice paradigm than the LDS or RDS rats over several generations. In contrast, there were no consistent differences among the groups for open field activity or performance in an elevated plus maze. There were no differences among the groups for voluntary alcohol intake, but the HDS rats exhibited greater suppression of alcohol and saccharin intake after injection of 8-OH-DPAT (0.125 mg kg-1). The HDS rats were also found to have a higher number of 5-HT-1A binding sites in cortical regions than the LDS or RDS rats, but there were no 5-HT-1A binding site differences in the raphe nuclei. These findings clearly show that consistent behavioral differences do occur in the 8-OH-DPAT-selected lines of rats, but only for behaviors related to possible depression or reward, not anxiety. The pattern of binding results suggests that these behavioral correlates of 8-OH-DPAT selection may be related to changes in cortical 5-HT-1A receptors rather than raphe autoreceptors.", 
    "43": "The antioxidant and cardioprotective effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, carvedilol, and its hydroxylated analog. BM-910228, were compared using the postischemic rat heart model. Hearts were infused with either agent (0.01, 0.10, or 10 nM final, or drug-free infusate) for 10 min prior to 30 min global ischemia, and also during the initial 15 min of reperfusion. Recovery of postischemic hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular systolic and developed pressures, mean diastolic pressure, cardiac output, coronary flow rate, and cardiac pressure-volume work), and the extent of postischemic tissue lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) loss, lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) formation, and lipid peroxidation (LPO)-derived free radical production were assessed and compared among the treatment groups. The depressive pharmacological properties (beta- and alpha-blockade) of both agents masked the extent of postischemic hemodynamic recovery, except at the lowest dose (10 pM) of the analog, which provided significant improvements in systolic and developed pressures, and cardiac work. Treatment with both agents provided significant dose-dependent reductions in postischemic LOOH formation and lipid alkoxyl radical production, as determined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and alpha-phenyl-tert-butylnitrone. (PBN) spin trapping (PBN/alkoxyl adduct hyperfine splitting alpha N = 13.63 G and alpha H = 1.93 G). Although both agents reduced oxidative injury, the hydroxylated analog was clearly the superior antioxidant (equipotent at doses two to three orders of magnitude lower) compared to the parent compound. This was also reflected with respect to three orders of magnitude lower) compared to the parent compound. This was also reflected with respect to drug-mediated improvement in myocardial preservation (reduced LDH release), which paralleled the antioxidant protective effects. Because neither agent displayed significant primary radical scavenging ability at doses (< or = 10 nM), which did provide substantial inhibition of postischemic LOOH and alkoxyl formation, our data suggest that the antioxidant properties of carvedilol and its analog are mediated primarily through a LPO chair-breaking mechanism. Moreover, the significant antioxidant protection afforded by the analog BM-910228 at subnanomolar levels places this agent into an exclusive category reserved for exceptionally potent antioxidants.", 
    "44": "We have recently reported that in an anesthetized rat model, generation of oxygen free radicals (OFR) via i.v. administration of Xanthine plus Xanthine Oxidase [X + XO] resulted in death of about 90% of the animals within a 120-min observation period. Pretreatment of the rats with endogenous scavengers Superoxide Dismutase and Catalase, or with felodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, and/or with dopexamine, an agonist of beta 2 adrenoceptors as well as dopamine (DA-1) receptors significantly enhanced the survival rate to over 70%. The present study was designed to investigate whether lipid peroxidation and ensuing respiratory depression contributed to the lethal toxicity of the free radicals. In the control group, the death of the rats administered [X + XO] was proceeded by significant increases in the plasma lipid peroxides (PLP) and by a severe hypertensive response characteristic of an intense ischemic state, which was confirmed by the presence of hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and acidosis. Placement of the animals on the positive pressure ventilation prior to the administration of [X + XO] did not prevent increases in PLP but, prevented any adverse alterations in the respiratory markers and significantly enhanced survival rate up to 70%. In contrast, both felodipine as well as dopexamine prevented any increases in PLP, normalized blood gas profile, and significantly increased survival rate to 80 to 90%. These observations suggest that the lethal toxicity produced by oxygen free radical was due to respiratory distress. The relationship between increases in the PLP and respiratory depression and the mechanisms via which two pharmacologically distinct agents, felodipine and dopexamine, facilitated the salutary effects cannot be conclusively stated at this time. It is further suggested that although the doses of these two drugs employed in the present studies are not adequate to function as antioxidants, such a possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.", 
    "45": "We examined the efficacy of a group of drugs that stabilize the cell membrane and can potentially prevent cytotoxicity in cultured fetal chick cardiac myocytes exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The effects of various membrane-protective agents were determined by analysis of the kinetics of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release. The kinetic parameters calculated from the data include a rate constant for release of LDH (kb) and the fraction of total LDH that is released from the cells (CIIMax). The CIIMaxs derived from a range of H2O2 concentrations reveal that the mean toxic concentration of H2O2 is 1.1 mM and that the pattern of toxicity is consistent with the damage being directly proportional to the concentration of the free radicals generated from the H2O2. Maximum nontoxic concentrations of three amphiphilic membrane protective agents had no effect upon cytotoxicity from H2O2. The slightly polar lipophilic agent, Trolox C, a vitamin E derivative, was also without protective effect at a maximum nontoxic concentration. The highly lipophilic agent, probucol, had a small protective effect at 50 microM, the maximum concentration we succeeded in solubilizing in the culture medium. However, the lipophilic 21-aminosteroid U74500, delivered to the cells in an emulsion, markedly reduced cytotoxicity from H2O2. The CII Max was significantly reduced and the protection was concentration dependent over a range of concentrations from 50-400 nmol/ml. Furthermore, the inhibition by U74500 was fully consistent with a mechanism of scavenging of free radicals formed during lipid peroxidation. In support of this hypothesis, a dose of 400 nmoles/ml completely prevented an increase in lipid peroxides due to H2O2 exposure, whereas there was a sixfold increase during exposure to H2O2 in untreated myocytes. Thus, a lipid soluble 21-aminosteroid prevented lipid peroxidation and reduced cardiac myocyte injury during exposure to H2O2, probably by scavenging of free radicals formed during lipid peroxidation in the cell membrane, whereas amphiphilic agents, which probably altered the physicochemical structure of the cell membrane but did not scavenge free radicals, were not protective.", 
    "46": "The binding capacity and sub-cellular distribution of beta 2 adrenergic receptors was explored in rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) following short-term (20 min) and long-term (24 hr) agonist treatment. ROS cells express about 27,000 beta 2 adrenergic receptors per cell, nearly 90% of which appear plasma membrane-associated by radioligand binding analysis. When cells were treated with isoproterenol for 20 min, lysed, and the lysate centrifuged over a gradient of sucrose, beta-adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane fraction were found to decline from approximately 90% to 50%, while those in a lower-density \"light\" vesicle fraction increased from approximately 10% to 50%. Immunoblotting with specific antisera against the beta 2 adrenergic receptor revealed, in sharp contrast, that 60% of receptor was distributed in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction, 40% in the light vesicle fraction of untreated cells. A 20-min exposure to agonist caused the 60:40 distribution of immunoreactive receptor between the two fractions (plasma membrane:light vesicle) to shift to 35:65. The distribution of immunoreactive G beta 1-subunit (36,000-M(r)) between the two fractions was 80:20 and not influenced by exposure of cells to agonist. A 24 hr-exposure to agonist changed markedly the distribution of immunoreactive receptor from 60:40 to 90:10 (plasma membrane: light vesicle). Receptor content as determined by radioligand binding, in contrast, was nondetectable in either fraction prepared from ROS cells stimulated by agonist for 24 hr. Immunoblotting of post-nuclear, supernatant fractions of whole-cell lysates revealed no change in receptor content after 24 hr of agonist treatment. Furthermore, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting revealed no prominent proteolytic degradation of receptor in response to agonist stimulation at 20 min or 24 hr. Indirect immunofluorescence of beta adrenergic receptors in fixed, intact ROS cells probed only cell surface-associated receptor and yielded equivalent epifluorescence signals for untreated cells and cells treated with isoproterenol for either 20 min, or 24 hr. The immunological results confirm the phenomenon of agonist-induced receptor sequestration, but reveal several new insights: (i) beta adrenergic receptor protein content and subcellular distribution may not be accurately reflected by radioligand binding; (ii) receptor down-regulation (loss of binding) after 24 hr exposure to agonist cannot be explained by enhanced receptor degradation; (iii) the cell surface complement of receptor is not altered at 20 min or 24 hr following stimulation of cells with agonist; and (iv) lateral sequestration of receptors to separate domains of the cell membrane occurs when ROS 17/2.8 cells are exposed to beta-agonist for a short time (20 min).",

VIP-induced relaxation was antagonized by phentolamine and VIP antagonist. Pretreatment with atropine, phentolamine, and diphenhydramine antagonized the motilin- and bombesin-induced contraction. Pretreatment with tetrodotoxin (TTX) attenuated the motilin- and bombesin-induced contraction, but not the SP-induced contraction and VIP-induced relaxation. EFS induced contraction, which was attenuated by TTX. Calcitonin gene-related peptide and neuropeptide Y had no effect on LES; however, they attenuated EFS-induced contraction. These findings suggest some characteristic peptidergic involvement in rabbit LES smooth muscle.",

The effect of eight beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs (sotalol, nifenalol, acebutolol, dichloroisoproterenol, propranolol, oxprenolol, pindolol, atenolol), and of amiodarone, was studied in isolated spontaneously beating guinea-pig Purkinje fibres by the intracellular microelectrode technique. Phase 3 early afterdepolarizations were initiated by nifenalol hydrochloride (n = 18; 10 mumol/l: 0/18, 40 mumol/l: 3/18, 80 mumol/l: 8/18, 160 mumol/l: 11/18), rac.-(+/-)-sotalol hydrochloride (n = 28; 20 mumol/l: 0/28, 40 mumol/l: 9/28, 80 mumol/l: 20/28), (R)(+)-sotalol hydrochloride (n = 12; 40 mumol/l: 1/12, 80 mumol/l: 4/12), and (S)(-)-sotalol hydrochloride (n = 10, 40 mumol/l: 1/10, 80 mumol/l: 4/10). The arrhythmogenic effect was reversible after a washout period of one hour and early after-depolarizations could be terminated by tetrodotoxin (0.4-1.6 mumol/l, n = 6). Amiodarone only induced early afterdepolarizations at a low extracellular potassium concentration of [K+]o = 1.35 mmol/l (n = 5; 150 mumol/l: 0/5, 300 mumol/l: 1/5). The initiation of early after-depolarizations by sotalol and nifenalol might be induced by an imbalance of sodium inward current and potassium outward currents, and early afterdepolarizations are blocked by tetrodotoxin.", 
    "54": "The permeability characteristics of air-interfaced rabbit tracheal epithelial cell monolayers to model macromolecules and low molecular weight solutes were evaluated. The model macromolecules were fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextrans of varying molecular sizes (4,000 to 70,000 daltons). The model low molecular weight solutes were beta-adrenergic compounds of similar sizes with widely different log octanol/pH 7.4 buffer partition coefficients (log P). FITC-dextrans were assayed spectrofluorimetrically and beta-adrenergic compounds were assayed by reverse phase HPLC with UV detection. The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) for FITC alone to FITC-dextran 70,000 in the tracheal epithelial barrier were in the range of 11.2 to 0.3 x 10(8) cm/sec. A molecular cut-off at about 20,000 daltons, consistent with a single equivalent pore population of about 5 nm in radius, was found. A sigmoidal relationship best described the influence of drug lipophilicity on the Papp of beta-adrenergic compounds, where the log P at the half maximal Papp was 2.08. Thus, the air-interfaced rabbit tracheal epithelial cell culture model has been successfully applied to elucidate the permeability of tracheal epithelial barrier to model macromolecules and small solutes. It appears that the tracheal epithelial cell monolayers absorb drugs in a similar manner as do native excised tracheal and other epithelia.",

Comparator drugs were propranolol in migraine and betahistine in vertigo. The study was carried out by 498 general practitioners in Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany, whose participation had been requested by mail. In total 3186 patients were entered: 1601 in the two migraine cohorts and 1585 in the two vertigo cohorts.",

There was no clear difference regarding efficacy between flunarizine and betahistine in the vertigo study. The safety evaluation focused on extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and depression. Overall, EPS were noted in only four patients, two in the vertigo-betahistine and two in the migraine-flunarizine cohort. A total of 70 patients developed depressive symptoms (34 in the flunarizine and 24 in the propranolol migraine cohorts, but only 7 in the flunarizine and 5 in the betahistine vertigo cohorts). Patients with migraine were clearly more prone to depression than patients with vertigo, regardless of their treatment. Additional risk factors for depression were a history of depression, and, in the migraine flunarizine cohort, a high number of previous migraine treatments.", 
    "61": "Desipramine (DMI, 15 mg/kg, s.c.) decreased [3H]CGP-12177-labelled cortical beta-adrenoceptor density (Bmax) by 30% upon chronic (14 day) treatment. However, even a single dose (in mg/kg) of DMI (15) or the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol (20), induced a rapid (24 hour) and significant reduction of beta-adrenoceptor Bmax (-15%; p < 0.01). Acute treatment with amitryptiline (10), clorgyline (1), fluoxetine (10), nomifensine (10) or maprotiline (20) had no significant effect on [3H]CGP-12177-labelled beta-adrenoceptors, suggesting that rapid down-regulation may not be a general property of antidepressant drugs. None of the antidepressants altered the Bmax of [3H]ketanserin-labelled 5-HT2A receptors on acute treatment. These results show that beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation by clenbuterol and DMI is not dependent on chronic treatment and may, therefore, be a poor correlate of the gradual onset of therapeutic efficacy seen clinically with antidepressant drugs.", 
    "62": "Serotonin 5-HT1A-type and beta-adrenergic receptors have similar molecular characteristics, which explains why certain substances like propranolol have affinities for both receptor types. Activation of 5-HT1A receptors leads to a decrease in intracellular cAMP levels whereas the opposite occurs for beta-adrenergic receptors. Both 5-HT1A and beta-adrenergic receptors exist in the rabbit ciliary processes. Topical application of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) reduces intraocular pressure (IOP). beta-Antagonists are also known to reduce IOP. It is postulated that substances which have an affinity for 5-HT1A and/or beta-adrenergic receptors and lead to a reduction in intracellular cAMP levels in the ciliary processes diminish IOP.",

Isoproterenol produced relaxation of pericytes in a dose-dependent manner over a range of 5 nM to 1 microM. Low concentrations of the nonselective beta-blockers propanolol and timolol blocked the relaxation produced by isoproterenol. The specific beta 2-adrenergic component of isoproterenol-induced relaxation was shown by blockage with bromoacetyl alprenolol menthane.

In contrast, it was found to be a much weaker inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme I (IC50 value of 600 nM). The topical administration of one 50 microliters drop of 0.5%, 1% and 2% solutions of dorzolamide maximally lowered the intraocular pressure (IOP) of glaucomatous monkeys by 22%, 30% and 37%, respectively. Good ocular hypotensive activity was also observed in ocular normotensive and hypertensive rabbits. Its site of action was within the eye, and the reductions in IOP in both species was achieved via decreased aqueous humor inflow. The duration of action of 2% dorzolamide was shorter than that of 0.5% timolol in glaucomatous monkeys. The IOP lowering activity of timolol in this paradigm was enhanced by the concomitant instillation of dorzolamide. Both acutely and repeatedly administered 2% dorzolamide did not decrease regional ocular blood flow in the rabbit, and the topical instillation of the drug had no adverse effects on the eye of rabbits, dogs and monkeys. Dorzolamide has been approved in a number of countries for use in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "65": "This study was conducted to determine whether active ion transport in the pigmented rabbit conjunctiva was subjected to cyclic AMP modulation. 8-BrcAMP and compounds that may affect intracellular cAMP levels were tested for their effects on the conjunctival short-circuit current (Isc) following mucosal application. Conjunctival Isc was increased by 1 mM 8-BrcAMP, 0.001-20 microM forskolin, 0.01-2 mM theophylline, 2 microM 1-epinephrine, and 20 microM terbutaline in a Cl(-)-containing but not in a Cl(-)-free medium. The increase in Isc induced by 1 mM 8-BrcAMP was reversed by 1 mM N-phenylanthranilic acid, suggesting enhancement of Cl- secretion by cAMP. Similarly, the increase in Isc induced by 20 microM terbutaline was blunted by 1 microM timolol, suggesting a role for beta 2 adrenergic modulation of Cl- secretion. Collectively, these results are consistent with the notion of cAMP modulation of conjunctival active ion transport.", 
    "66": "Topical delivery of timolol by inserts or similar controlled-release devices may offer distinct advantages over administration by eyedrops. The purpose of this investigation was the evaluation in rabbits of ophthalmic inserts (denominated mini-tablets, MT) for sustained/controlled release of timolol maleate (TiM). The MTs (diameter 3.5 mm, thickness 1.5 mm, average TiM content 0.34 or 0.68 mg) were prepared by compressing appropriate mixtures of powders with a standard tabletting machine. A thin, rate-controlling membrane was applied over the devices by spraying aqueous dispersions of acrylic copolymers. A first series of different (uncoated and coated) MTs were tested for release of TiM to the lacrimal fluid, using commercial eyedrops (Timoptol 0.5%) as a reference standard. Two MTs (one of which was coated) and the same reference solution were then selected for an ocular absorption study. Analysis of TiM in the aqueous humor indicated that the coated MT was capable of maintaining low and steady levels of TiM for at least 19 h, while the other device, identical but uncoated, produced a prolonged-pulse effect lasting about 8 h. The apparent mean residence time (MRT) of TiM in the aqueous humor was 1.3 h for the reference solution, 3.2 h for the uncoated MT, and 5.7 h for the coated one. The present preliminary results point to the potential validity of coated mini-tablets as simple systems for controlled ocular delivery of timolol.",

In addition, unanswered questions are the final arterial pressure achieved during treatment as well as the ideal renal- and cardiovascular-protective drug therapy. Most antihypertensive agents given for periods of several months in monotherapy have no consistent effect on renal function and hemodynamics. However, they may differ with regard to their influence on other factors considered to be markers of significant impact of hypertension on the kidney, such as albuminuria.

    "68": "Experiments were performed to determine the subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors involved in the contraction induced by rilmenidine in isolated canine cutaneous veins. Rings of saphenous vein (without endothelium) were suspended for the recording of isometric force in physiological salt solution. All experiments were performed in the presence of propranolol (to antagonize beta-adrenoceptors), cocaine (to inhibit neuronal uptake) and hydrocortisone (to inhibit extraneuronal uptake). In the presence of rauwolscine (an alpha 2-adrenergic blocker), rilmenidine caused concentration-dependent contractions which were inhibited by prazosin (nonselective alpha 1-antagonist) and by (+)niguldipine (selective alpha 1A-adrenergic antagonist), but not by (-)niguldipine. After treatment with phenoxybenzamine (to alkylate alpha 1-adrenoceptors), rilmenidine evoked contractions of the canine saphenous vein which were antagonized competitively by rauwolscine. The combination of rauwolscine and prazosin did not abolish contractions evoked by the highest concentrations of rilmenidine. Although binding experiments using 3H-idazoxan suggested the existence of a nonadrenergic binding site (around 20% of the total binding), contractile studies failed to demonstrate their involvement in the increases in tension evoked by rilmenidine. These experiments suggest that the contractions evoked by rilmenidine in isolated canine veins are mediated by both alpha 1A- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "69": "This study was performed to investigate the efficacy of esmolol, an agent used in hypotensive anesthesia for middle ear surgery. We compared 20 ASA I-II patients to 20 controls in whom we administered routine anesthesia. All patients were premedicated with intramuscular 0.05 mg/kg atropine, 1 mg/kg pethidine and 25 mg promethazine. Anesthesia was induced with 0.004 mg/kg fentanyl and 5 mg/kg thiopental sodium. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg was administered to facilitate intubation. Isoflurane, nitrous oxide, oxygen, 0.08 mg/kg vecuronium bromide and controlled ventilation were used for anesthetic maintenance. Before the controlled hypotensive period, nitrous oxide was discontinued and an esmolol infusion started. We registered hemodynamic values (via noninvasive and invasive radial artery cannulation), central venous pressure, electrocardiography, body temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, periferal oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gas analysis. Mean infusion rate of esmolol was 330 +/- 10 micrograms/kg/min. We found significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (28.7%), mean blood pressure (26.5%) and diastolic blood pressure (33.4%). The operative field was virtually bloodless. Hemodynamic values recovered to normal or to within -12.45% of normal at the end of intravenous esmolol infusion. During the postoperative period, no side effects were observed. In conclusion, esmolol is an appropriate hypotensive agent for patients undergoing middle ear surgery under hypotensive anesthesia because it yields no side effects, it is easy to control administration and it provides the desired degree of hypotension without complications.",

Forty-two elderly hypertensives (mean 72 +/- 5 years) were given either ACE inhibitors (A group: perindopril in 10 and captopril in 4 cases), beta blockers (B group: arotinolol in 15 cases) or calcium antagonists (C group: nifedipine in 3 and nitrendipine in 10 cases) for 8-12 weeks. The responses to handgrip and mental arithmetic stress and cardiac functional changes were determined by echocardiography before and after the medications. The decrease in blood pressure at rest and on the stress tests was similar among the three groups, though the hemodynamic responses to the stress tests showed some differences. In the A group, no hemodynamic changes were seen either at rest or on the stress tests after the medication. In the B group, the heart rate and the cardiac output were decreased at rest, and the increase of them on the stress tests were diminished after the medication. On the contrary, the heart rate and the cardiac output were increased, and showed exaggerated responses on the stress tests in the C group. In conclusion, in antihypertensive treatment of elderly hypertensive patients it is important to consider the effects of the antihypertensive drugs on the hemodynamics, although the comparable decrease in blood pressure is expected.", 
    "71": "Possible central noradrenergic and cholinergic modulation of acute peripheral inflammation was investigated in rats, adopting the formaldehyde-induced pedal inflammation as the experimental model. Intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered noradrenaline (NA), alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, L-phenylephrine, alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, suppressed formaldehyde-induced inflammation producing a decrease in oedema volume and increase in pain threshold. Conversely, both noradrenergic neuron degenerator, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine produced an increase in paw oedema along with an augmentation of pain. Significant oedema augmenting effects were also produced by central excitatory neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) on icv administration. ACh also produced pro-nociceptive action. An ACh antagonist, scopolamine and ACh synthesis inhibitor, hemicholinium-3 (HC) reduced pedal oedema and produced analgesia. The results of this study indicate that central NA exerts an inhibitory effect on peripheral oedema and pain whereas, ACh has an augmenting effect on formaldehyde-induced peripheral inflammation.", 
    "72": "Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of vasopressin used to promote hemostasis and reduce postoperative blood loss. Recent studies have shown that desmopressin decreases arterial blood pressure in the anesthetized rat and relaxes isolated segments of aorta and pulmonary artery. Responses to a clinical preparation of desmopressin were investigated in the hindquarters vascular bed of the cat under constant flow conditions so that changes in perfusion pressure directly reflect changes in vascular resistance. Responses to desmopressin and its vehicle, and the effect of receptor antagonists, inhibitors of prostaglandin, and nitric oxide synthesis inhibitors, were investigated.", 
    "73": "In a double-blind, parallel study, the effects of 25 mg carvedilol and 50 mg atenolol on peripheral finger circulation and arterial pulse curve configuration were compared.", 
    "74": "Healthy volunteers (n = 17) were examined at baseline and for 15 min after 60 s of hand cooling in ice-water. Finger temperature and digital plethysmography were recorded each minute from the cooled and the control hands. Measurements were also made before and 2 h after drug administration.", 
    "75": "Blood pressure declined from 120/86 to 108/74 mm Hg after atenolol (n = 9), and from 122/88 to 108/73 mm Hg after carvedilol (n = 8). In both groups, baseline finger temperature increased slightly after drug, and a more rapid rise in finger temperature was observed after cooling. There was no group difference in the drug effect on finger temperature, except in the first few minutes after cooling, when temperature recovery was greater after carvedilol. Carvedilol reduced the vasoconstrictor response to local cooling (digital plethysmography), compared both to the value before drug and after atenolol. At rest, carvedilol changed the pulse curves (control hand) towards vasodilatation and high compliance, expressed as a mean change in the relative height of the dicrotic notch of -10.3% versus 0.0% after atenolol.", 
    "76": "Future studies should clarify whether the vasoactive profile of carvedilol may translate into reduced occurrence of cold hands and feet amongst patients treated for hypertension.", 
    "77": "The influences of aging on the response of urinary bladder detrusor smooth muscle in response to neurogenic stimulation (electric field stimulation) were investigated in rats aged 3-4 months (young) and 18-20 months (old). In addition, age-associated changes in calcium homeostasis were evaluated by comparing the basal intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), the change of [Ca2+]i in response to field stimulation, the contractile response at different extracellular calcium concentrations (Ca2+ = 1.8, 0.6, and 0 mM), and the sensitivity to the L-type calcium channel blocker. In both groups, the frequency-response curve in response to field stimulation (1-32 Hz) was similar. The contractile response to field stimulation was biphasic (phasic and tonic). The phasic/tonic ratio at different frequencies was similar between the two groups. The contractile responses were equally inhibited by atropine (1 microM) and preincubation with alpha, beta-methylene ATP (50 microM). Tetrodotoxin (1 microM) virtually abolished the responses to field stimulation in both groups. The biphasic components showed different sensitivities to diltiazem and low calcium. The tonic component was more readily inhibited by diltiazem, whereas the phasic component was more sensitive to low calcium medium. In general, the response to lower frequency stimulations was more sensitive to both diltiazem and low calcium. The aged group was more sensitive to the inhibitory effects of both low calcium and diltiazem. In Ca2(+)-free medium, the contractile response to higher frequency (e.g., 32 Hz) was temporarily preserved in most of the preparations. This response disappeared after repeated stimulation. The magnitude of this Ca2(+)-free response to 32 Hz stimulation was significantly lower in the aged group than in the young group (18.1 +/- 1.4 vs.29.1 +/- 3.2% of the control response in normal Tyrode medium, P < 0.05). The basal [Ca2+]i levels were similar in the two groups (young: 131 +/- 12 nM, n = 5; old: 118 +/- 10 nM, n = 4, P > 0.05). The magnitude and time course of the [Ca2+]i response to field stimulation were also similar in the two groups. It is concluded that aging seems to have little effect on the neuromuscular activities of rat urinary bladder. However, the calcium homeostasis may be altered as evidenced by the increased sensitivity to diltiazem and low extracellular calcium.", 
    "78": "Physical exercise causes transient albuminuria. The mechanisms of postexercise albuminuria are not fully clarified but stimulation of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) probably plays a major role through intrarenal haemodynamic changes causing an elevated filtration pressure. In a randomised, double-blind, crossover study we compared the effects on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of lisinopril (L) and atenolol (A) therapy, i.e. we aimed to investigate whether inhibition of the RAS or inhibition of beta1-adrenoceptor-mediated effects of the sympathetic nervous system differed with regard to changes in UAE. Sixteen patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension were studied. Four standardised bicycle ergometer exercise tests were performed, before and after each active treatment period. UAE 30 min postexercise, determined by radioimmunoassay, was significantly lowered by both treatments: -278 mu g center dot min-1 (L) and -199 mu g center dot min-1 (A). The reduction of postexercise UAE achieved by treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (L) was significantly greater than that achieved by the beta1-selective adrenoceptor blocker treatment. Blood pressure (BP) at rest and during exercise were equally reduced by both drugs. In conclusion, this study showed that antihypertensive treatment with an ACE inhibitor was more effective in reducing exercise-induced albuminuria than a beta1-selective adrenoceptor-blocking agent with a similar degree of BP reduction in patients with uncomplicated primary hypertension. This suggests that the RAS plays a major role in postexercise albuminuria in hypertensive subjects. The clinical significance of this finding, however, remains to be clarified.", 
    "79": "The caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) is an area of the brainstem, in the vicinity of the hypoglossal nerve roots, where cholinergic and adrenergic neurons participate in respiratory and vasomotor control. Cardiorespiratory depression has been produced by topical application of cocaine to the CVLM. In the present studies, the effects of topical pretreatments of the CVLM with alpha-adrenergic blockers (prazosin 4.8 mM) and beta-adrenergic blockers (propranolol 11.3 mM) on the cardiorespiratory responses to topically administered cocaine (37 mM) were investigated in urethane anesthetized cats. Both prazosin and propranolol failed to produce ventilatory responses and to counteract cocaine-induced apneustic breathing. However, the cocaine-induced decrement in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) following pretreatment of the CVLM with propranolol was found to be 11 +/- 5%, compared to the 18 +/- 5% decrement produced by cocaine alone. These differences were not statistically significant. Procaine (37 mM) in equimolar doses to cocaine, produced a small statistically significant decrement in MABP (P < 0.05) without ventilatory effects. Topical administration of procaine (73.3 mM), at approximately twice the equimolar dosage of cocaine, produced apneustic breathing that was indistinguishable from that produced by cocaine. The neurotoxic properties of cocaine that produce apneustic breathing appear to be similar to that produced by the anesthetic agent procaine, and the alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockers prazosin and propranolol do not appear to antagonize the vasomotor depression induced by cocaine at the CVLM.", 
    "80": "This study was aimed at investigating the role of the adrenergic mechanism in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) in sexual arousal and copulatory performance. Saline, norepinephrine (NE), phenoxybenzamine (PBZ) and propranolol (PROP) were injected into the mPOA in different groups of rats. NE application (3 micrograms) facilitated the male sexual behavior by increasing sexual arousal and copulatory performance. On the other hand, application of PROP and PBZ produced inhibition of male sexual behavior. Effects produced by low doses of PROP were more significant than PBZ. The results, viewed in the light of other available reports, suggest that the mPOA beta-adrenergic mechanism is important in the elaboration of male sexual behavior.", 
    "81": "Beta-adrenergic receptors mediate the inhibitory influence of cathecolamines on GH secretion, probably via the stimulation of hypothalamic somatostatin release. Accordingly, beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists inhibit and increase, respectively, the GH response to many stimuli, including GHRH, in man. Aim of the present study was to verify the effect, if any, of beta-adrenergic drugs on the GH response to Hexarelin, a synthetic GH-releasing hexapeptide. Interestingly, the GH-releasing effect of Hexarelin has been reported to be partially refractory to neuroendocrine manipulations known to strongly enhance or abolish the GHRH-induced GH release. In 6 normal male volunteers (aged 22-27 yr) we studied the interaction of the maximally effective iv dose of Hexarelin (HEX, 2 micrograms/kg iv at 0 min) with atenolol (100 mg po at -60 min) or salbutamol (0.08 mg/kg po at -60 min), which are beta-adrenergic antagonist and agonist, respectively. HEX induced a marked GH rise (AUC, mean +/- SE: 4573.2 +/- 588.8 micrograms.min/L), which was unchanged by atenolol (4706.2 +/- 928.2 micrograms.min/L) but blunted by salbutamol (2792.8 +/- 618.0 micrograms.min/L, p < 0.03). In conclusion, present data show that, in man, the GH-releasing effect of Hexarelin is not enhanced by beta-adrenergic blockade while is only blunted by the activation of beta receptors. According to other data, these results indicate that the potent GH-releasing activity of Hexarelin is, at least partially, refractory to beta-adrenergic-mediated manipulations of somatostatinergic activity.", 
    "82": "The in vivo hemodynamic and morphologic responses of the rat left (LV) and right (RV) ventricle to continuous long-term i.v. infusion of norepinephrine (NE) at different dosages and for different durations of infusion were studied. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received continuous intravenous infusion of norepinephrine from infors syringe pumps for 24, 48 and 72 h at a dose of 200 mu g center dot kg-1 x h-1. Furthermore, NE was infused for 72 h at dosages of 50, 100 and 200 mu g center dot kg-1 x h-1. The beta-adrenergic blocker and vasodilator with alpha1-blocking activity carvedilol (0.5 mg x kg-1 x h-1) was coinfused with NE for 72 h. The hemodynamic effects were measured on intact, anesthetized rats with special Millar ultraminiature pressure tip catheters, and the weights of the left and right ventricles were measured. NE increased heart rate at any time or dose, whereas cardiac output and total peripheral resistance remained unchanged. LV and RV dP/dtmax were nearly doubled as compared to control values and RVSP was elevated by more than 100%. The effect of NE on LVSP was much less pronounced (< 20%) and only significant at 50 mu g x kg-1 x h-1 for 72 h. Neither LV nor RV end-diastolic pressures were elevated, indicating that cardiac failure had not occurred. The LV developed hypertrophy with an increase of the ventricular weight/body weight ratio (LVW/BW) of 22% even after only 2 days of NE (200 mu g x kg-1 center dot h-1). The RV showed no hypertrophy at any time of the experiments. The NE-induced changes in HR, dP/dtmax, RVSP and LVW/BW were completely prevented by the coinfusion of carvedilol. These studies show that the hemodynamic responses to continuous infusion of NE are more pronounced in the RV than in the LV. Conversely, NE induced hypertrophy only in the LV, not in the RV. The hemodynamic effects of chronic NE infusion did not change significantly between 1 and 3 days of infusion. The in vivo responses to exogenous NE therefore were unaffected by adaptive effects such as downregulation of adrenergic receptors.", 
    "83": "Using a clonal cell line of human osteoclast precursors (FLG 29.1 cells), that after treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) show many functional characteristics of osteoclasts, we demonstrated that catecholamines act as inducers of osteoclast maturation in vitro and as stimulators of osteoclast activity via the binding to beta 2 adrenergic receptors. Scatchard analysis of 125I-labelled iodocyanopindolol to untreated (undifferentiated) or TPA-treated (differentiated) FLG 29.1 cells revealed the presence of a single high-affinity site with a Kd value around 24 pM and 8 pM respectively and with superimposable binding capacity (1.18 fmol/mg protein). Catecholamines increased in a dose-dependent fashion the intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in both undifferentiated and TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells. Pretreatment of untreated and TPA-treated FLG 29.1 cells with propranolol inhibited the catecholamine effect on cAMP accumulation, while pretreatment with clonidine had no effect. Catecholamines also reduced cell proliferation, increased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAcP) activity, interleukin 6 (IL-6) production, multi-nuclearity and response to salmon calcitonin (sCT) in undifferentiated FLG 29.1 cells. In differentiated FLG 29.1 cells only IL-6 release was induced by catecholamine treatment. These findings support a potential role for catecholamines in modulating osteoclast differentiation and mature osteoclast activity.", 
    "84": "The beta-adrenergic effects of catecholamines are potentiated by thyroid hormones in adipose tissue. Amiodarone (AM) is structurally similar to thyroid hormones and was used to explore the mechanism of the triiodothyronine (T3) effect on beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) in adipose tissue. AM decreases the expression of some T3 sensitive genes in various tissues and antagonizes the effect of T3 on its nuclear receptors. In this study, the T3, AM and AM + T3 effects on the beta 1- and beta 3-AR density were assessed on rat white adipocytes by radioligand binding using [3H]CGP 12177 after characterization of these subtypes by displacement of [3H]CGP 12177 binding by isoproterenol, BRL 37344 and noradrenaline. BRL 37344 was used to study beta 3-AR lipolysis. White adipocytes from hyperthyroid rats had increased responsiveness (Emax x 2) and sensitivity (+ 38%) to BRL 37344, while those given AM alone had decreased values. Moreover, AM antagonized the T3 effect on lipolysis. The beta 1-binding characteristics (receptor density [Bmax]: 45 +/- 4 fmol/mg of proteins; dissociation factor [Kd]: 0.96 +/- 0.10 nM) were not modified by either compound. Finally, T3 significantly increased beta 3-AR density (587 +/- 69 versus 363 +/- 25 fmol/mg of proteins) and Kd (38 +/- 2 versus 23 +/- 3 nM), while AM alone had no effect and did not antagonize the T3 effect on beta 3-AR number. In conclusion, the hyperthyroid state in the rat potentiated the lipolytic response of white adipocytes to a specific beta 3-agonist and increased the beta 3-AR density without changing in beta 1-AR number and affinity. Furthermore, the lack of antagonism between AM and T3 on beta 3-AR expression suggests that T3 does not work directly on the beta 3-AR gene. Moreover, AM induced a functional tissular hypothyroid-like effect and its antilipolytic effect probably occurred at a postreceptor level.",

    "89": "Further reduction in the morbidity and mortality from diseases associated with heart failure is to be expected by the early introduction of strategies aimed at preventing cardiac damage. In the future, ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and type III antiarrhythmic agents, as well as pacemakers, will be used judiciously and in combination following better risk profiling using non-invasive techniques. Cardiac transplantation could be a more widely used treatment for end-stage cardiac disease. Ongoing randomized studies are revealing the usefulness of various pharmaceutical products as well as implanted defibrillators. In the more distant future, anti-endothelin therapy, cardiac autoantibody immunotherapy, cardiac-specific inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme and/or normalization of autonomic parasympathetic activity by parasympathomimetic agents may prove to be additional tools for reducing the complications from cardiac disease.", 
    "90": "Short-acting formulations of nifedipine-like 1,4-dihydropyridines cause clearly less regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) than anticipated from their antihypertensive effect. Moreover, these compounds increase the risk of cardiac death and myocardial reinfarction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) not on concomitant beta-blocker therapy. Increased sympathetic activity is one of the non-pressure-related risk factors for LVH and atherosclerosis in hypertensives. In addition, increased sympathetic tone may precipitate clinical events in subclinical or stable CAD. Intermittent increases in sympathetic activity persist during chronic treatment with those 1,4-dihydropyridines that have a poor peak/trough ratio with a rapid fall of BP and deactivation of the arterial baroreflex. On the other hand, these intermittent increases in sympathetic activity do not occur for formulations and compounds with a gradual and sustained antihypertensive effect over the dosing interval. Such long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridines cause regression of LVH as anticipated from their antihypertensive effect, and are similar to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In contrast to short-acting 1,4-dihydropyridines, long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridines appear not to be detrimental for patients with stable CAD. However, the evidence is still missing for patients with unstable CAD. Neither is there evidence that they will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CAD when used for the chronic treatment of hypertension.",

    "92": "In nine patients undergoing sclerotherapy, the values obtained correlated closely with those determined by fine-needle puncture of the varices (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). In 15 patients receiving placebo as part of a double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective evaluation of prophylactic treatment with propranolol, variceal pressure did not change significantly over a 1-year period: 16.5 +/- 3.2 mmHg at onset: 16.7 +/- 3.4 after 3 months and 15.9 +/- 3.5 after 12 months. In contrast, propranolol therapy given to 15 patients decreased the pressure from 16.2 +/- 3.0 mmHg before therapy to 13.5 +/- 2.0 after 3 months (p < 0.001) and to 13.1 +/- 4.1 after 12 months (p < 0.05). Patients with a recent bleeding episode had higher pressures than those who had not yet experienced any haemorrhage (19.3 +/- 3.5 mmHg, n = 17 vs 13.9 +/- 3.3, n = 62) (p < 0.001). This was confirmed in a prospective study: the last variceal pressure in bleeders and non-bleeders was respectively 17.2 +/- 1.7 mmHg (n = 4) and 14.8 +/- 4.1 mmHg (n = 26) (p < 0.01). Overall, variceal pressure measurements correlated with the size of varices, the presence of red colour signs and with the North Italian Endoscopic Club score.",

    "94": "alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic and muscarinic-cholinergic regulation in spontaneous beating and Ca2+ oscillations in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes at day 6 of culture was investigated. The spontaneous beating in myocytes decreased in the presence of 10 microM norepinephrine (NE). This negative chronotropic action was antagonized by prazosin. Carbachol (CCh) also showed negative chronotropic action which was inhibited by atropine. On the other hand, isoproterenol (ISP) increased the beating rate which was antagonized by propranolol. NE increased inositol phosphate formation whereas CCh and ISP did not. NE and CCh suppressed the frequency of the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations but ISP increased. The present results suggest that alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptors regulate chronotropism to be negative whereas beta-adrenoceptor regulates chronotropism to be positive in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.",

    "97": "1. The inotropic effects of (-)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)benzimidazol-2-one ((-)-CGP 12177), an antagonist for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors as well as an agonist for beta 3-adrenoceptors, were investigated on paced preparations of isolated right atrial appendages obtained from patients without advanced heart failure undergoing open heart surgery. 2. In the presence of (-)-propranolol (200 nM), (-)-CGP 12177 increased contractile force with a -log EC50, M, of 7.3. The maximum effects of (-)-CGP 12177 amounted to 15% and 11% of the effects of (-)-isoprenaline (400 microM) and of CaCl2 (6.75 mM) respectively. 3. (-)-Bupranolol 1 microM, an antagonist with a pKB of approximately 7.5 for beta 3-adrenoceptors, antagonized surmountably the positive inotropic effects of (-)-CGP 12177 (in the presence of 200 nM (-)-propranolol) with an apparent pKB of 7.3. 4. The potent positive inotropic effects of (-)-CGP 12177 and their resistance to blockade by (-)-propranolol but antagonism by (-)-bupranolol are consistent with the existence in human atrial myocardium of a minor third beta-adrenoceptor population, possibly related to beta 3-adrenoceptors.", 
    "98": "We have studied the enantioselectivity and regioselectivity of ring-hydroxylation and N-desisopropylation of R(+)- and S(-)-propranolol in microsomes from yeast expressing cytochrome P4502D6 (CYP2D6), using both NADPH and molecular oxygen (NADPH/O2) and cumene hydroperoxide-supported reactions. With NADPH/O2-supported reactions, CYP2D6 catalyzed 4- and 5-ring-hydroxylation, as well as N-desisopropylation of propranolol, although Vmax was considerably greater for ring-hydroxylation, compared with N-desisopropylation. The R/S ratios for KM and Vmax were less than unity for all three pathways. In contrast, using cumene hydroperoxide-supported reactions, CYP2D6 catalyzed 4- and 5-ring-hydroxylation, and there was negligible N-desisopropylation of propranolol. The R/S ratio for KM was less than unity, but the R/S ratio for Vmax was close to unity. The cumyl group of cumene hydroperoxide did not seem to be a selective inhibitor of N-desisopropylation, because i) cumyl alcohol (a nonalkylhydroperoxide analog of cumene hydroperoxide) did not inhibit N-desisopropylation in NADPH/O2-supported reactions, and ii) the use of t-butyl hydroperoxide (a noncumyl alkylhydroperoxide) to support CYP2D6 catalysis resulted in ring-hydroxylation, but not N-desisopropylation. At a propranolol concentration near KM, quinidine inhibited both ring-hydroxylation and N-desisopropylation in an equipotent manner in NADPH/O2-supported reactions. However, in cumene hydroperoxide-supported reactions, the IC50 of inhibition of ring-hydroxylation by quinidine was an order of magnitude less potent than in NADPH/O2-supported reactions. Our study shows that recombinant CYP2D6 cannot only catalyze 4- and 5-ring-hydroxylation of propranolol, but also N-desisopropylation. The lack of propranolol N-desisopropylation observed in cumene hydroperoxide-supported reactions highlights the need for caution when using alkyhydroperoxides to study CYP2D6 catalysis.", 
    "99": "1. Variable results have been reported on the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockers on maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and exercise endurance. This may in part be due to different subject populations, but it could also be due to an adaption of metabolic and haemodynamic responses to exercise during chronic treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers. The present study was therefore carried out to examine the effect of acute and chronic administration of the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol on both peak VO2 and exercise performance in the same subjects. Since the effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockade has not been properly investigated in women, eight healthy women were compared with seven men. Progressive bicycle exercise to exhaustion was performed after propranolol 0.15 mg kg-1 i.v. (acute) or 80 mg three times daily for 2 weeks (chronic) or placebo given according to a double-blind crossover design. 2. Mean (s.e. mean) peak VO2, was significantly reduced from 42.3 (1.6) ml min-1 kg-1 during placebo to 40.3 (1.2, P < 0.05) ml min-1 kg-1 after acute and 39.1 (1.2, P < 0.001) ml min-1 kg-1 after chronic propranolol treatment. No significant difference in peak VO2 between the two propranolol treatment regimens was observed (mean difference 1.2, 95% CI -0.1 to 2.4 ml min-1 kg-1). There was no treatment interaction with gender. 3. Cumulative work, 163 (9.3) kJ, was significantly reduced by acute, 148 (7.7, P < 0.001) kJ, and chronic, 147 (7.6, P < 0.001) kJ, administration of propranolol since the time to exhaustion was reduced by 5.3% and 5.3%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two regimens of propranolol (mean difference 0.2, 95% CI -6.7 to 7.0 kJ) or between the sexes. Maximal knee extensor and handgrip strengths were not affected by propranolol. 4. Whereas sex did not influence ventilatory, haemodynamic or metabolic parameters, some differences were observed between acute and chronic propranolol treatment. During submaximal exercise oxygen uptake was reduced by approximately 2% and RER values increased by 0.04-0.05 after chronic treatment in contrast to no effect of acute propranolol treatment. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure were reduced significantly more after chronic compared with acute propranolol treatment; peak heart rate being 186 (2.2), 147 (2.3) and 134 (2.3) beats min-1, and peak systolic blood pressure being 189 (7), 171 (4) and 161 (4) mmHg after placebo, acute and chronic propranolol administration, respectively. Also the exercise induced rise in potassium and lactate levels were modified differentially; the rise in potassium concentration was less after chronic compared with acute propranolol treatment and lactate levels were reduced only after chronic administration of propranolol. In contrast, ventilation, which was unchanged after propranolol during submaximal exercise, was reduced to similar extent at exhaustion from 108 (6.4) to 97 (7.2) and 96 (5.9) l min-1 after acute and chronic propranolol administration, respectively. Diastolic blood pressure and subjective perception of fatigue were similar across the treatment regimens. 5. The study has demonstrated that acute and chronic administration of propranolol result in different haemodynamic and metabolic response to exercise, although endurance and peak oxygen consumption were reduced to the same extent. The response to propranolol was not significantly different between men and women.", 
    "100": "In the present study, the hypothesis that somatodendritic availability of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) could be regulated independently of the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was tested. The 5-HT pathway was electrically stimulated at the level of the ventromedial tegmentum and the ensuing action potentials, recorded in the dorsal raphe, met all criteria for antidromic invasion of 5-HT neurons. The latency of antidromic spikes was current-dependent and the changes in latency were of quantal nature. This observation suggests an electrotonic coupling between 5-HT neurons. Stimulation of the ventromedial tegmentum also induced a decrease in the probability of firing of 5-HT neurons. This reduction in 5-HT neuron firing activity is a 5-HT-mediated response, due to an increased bioavailability of the neurotransmitter in the biophase of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. The intravenous administration of the 5-HT1 agonists TFMPP and RU 24969 reduced the duration of suppression of firing induced by the 5-HT-pathway stimulation, without altering the spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons. The effect of TFMPP and RU 24969 on duration of suppression was blocked by (+-)mianserin, a drug with high affinity for the rat 5-HT1D, but not 5-HT1B, receptors. On the other hand, (-)propranolol, a mixed 5-HT antagonist also blocked the effect of TFMPP. However, the selective 5-HT1A antagonist (+)WAY 100135 did not alter the effect of TFMPP. These results, in keeping with previous anatomical studies, suggest the existence of electrotonic coupling of 5-HT neurons and indicate that 5-HT release in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus may be controlled independently of firing-regulating 5-HT1A autoreceptors. They also suggest that 5-HT1D receptors may play a role in this regulatory function of 5-HT neurons.", 
    "101": "We examined the influence of hypotension by infusion of acebutolol hydrochloride (AH), a cardioselective beta-receptor antagonist, on cochlear blood flow in guinea pigs with various hematocrit values. AH infusion lowered the mean blood pressure to almost the same degree in all animals, regardless of the hematocrit level. The degree of the concomitant decrease of CBF varied with the hematocrit, being greater in animals with a higher hematocrit. In those with the highest hematocrit CBF did not return to the initial level. From these values we calculated the O2 transport capacity after AH infusion and found it to be lower than in animals without AH infusion. The difference was greater at higher hematocrits. These findings suggest that the microcirculation of the inner ear is responsive to transient decreases of perfusion pressure at high hematocrits.", 
    "102": "Beta3-Adrenoceptors are involved in the control of catecholamine-induced lipolysis in rodent adipose tissues. The expression and function of human beta3-adrenoceptors were investigated in subcutaneous white adipocytes of young healthy women. In these cells, beta3-adrenoceptor mRNAs represent 20% of total amount of beta-adrenoceptor transcripts and less than half of beta1-adrenoceptor transcripts. Among beta3-agonists known to stimulate beta3-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis in rodent fat cells, only CGP12177 was able to mediate such activity in human fat cells. In in vitro lipolysis experiments and in situ microdialysis studies, CGP12177 had a 4- to 5-times lower lipolytic efficacy than isoprenaline, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist. CGP12177-induced lipolysis was antagonized in vitro by bupranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist potent on rodent beta3-adrenoceptors but not by nadolol, a beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist. The in vitro blockade of isoprenaline-stimulated lipolysis by nadolol showed that the agonist acted solely via beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors. Isoprenaline and CGP12177 were able to increase the nutritive blood flow suggesting an interaction of these molecules with receptors present in adipose tissue vessels. In conclusion, beta3-adrenoceptors are expressed in human subcutaneous white adipocytes but do not significantly contribute to isoprenaline-induced lipolysis.", 
    "103": "Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) complicate postoperative management after coronary bypass surgery in about 30% of all patients. Though a prophylactic treatment both with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and the calcium antagonist diltiazem has been used for the prevention of post-operative SVT, no study yet has performed a prospective comparison of the efficacy of these therapies.", 
    "104": "To investigate the prophylactic effect of either a calcium antagonist (diltiazem, 0.1 mg/kg per h i.v.) or a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol, 10 mg every 6 h postoperatively), we randomized prospectively 103 consecutive patients into three groups, the third one serving as a control group. Anti-arrhythmic medication was started with the procedure and was continued until the 3rd postoperative day.", 
    "105": "Preoperative conditions were the same for the three groups concerning age, extent of coronary heart disease, ventricular function and heart-related medication. There were no differences in intraoperative parameters or postoperative enzyme patterns. Diltiazem was ineffective in preventing SVT, the incidence being exactly the same as in the control group (35%). Propranolol reduced the occurrence of SVT significantly (7%, P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients treated with diltiazem needed positive inotropic support more often in the first hours after surgery than patients of the control group (30% vs 5%, P < 0.01).", 
    "106": "The perioperative administration of low-dose propranolol is considered a safe and effective drug prophylaxis to avoid the occurrence of SVT after bypass surgery.", 
    "107": "The combination of beta-blockers and amiodarone has been shown to be affective in the treatment of refractory chronic ventricular tachycardia. However, the possible induction of excessive sinus bradycardia can constitute a limitation to the use of this treatment. Celiprolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker with a partial beta-2 agonist activity and an alpha-2 blocking activity, with a minimal depressant effect on heart rate. It therefore seemed useful to evaluate this drug in combination with amiodarone in patients with chronic ventricular tachycardia refractory to amiodarone alone. Twelve men with age of 57 +/- 16 years (9 with a history of myocardial infarction) received 200 mg of celiprolol per day associated with an average of 2 grams of amiodarone per week. Failure of oral amiodarone alone was confirmed by \"reloading\" (1,200 mg per day for 4 days) in 11 patients. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 36 +/- 19%, and was < or = 30% in 5 patients. Three patients were classified as stage 3-4 of the NYHA functional classification. Episodes of tachycardia were paroxysmal in 10 patients and diurnal in 10 cases. The effects of treatment were evaluated by clinical examination, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, stress test and endocavitary electrophysiological investigation. No patient developed cardiac decompensation or collapse during beta-blocker treatment. In one case, the dose of celiprolol had to be decreased to 100 mg per day because of hypotension. No proarrhythmic effect was observed. The sinus rate remained unchanged after addition of celiprolol to amiodarone (57 +/- 3 bpm before versus 56 +/- 4 bpm after). On the stress test, the exercise capacity was maintained and no tachyarrhythmia was induced. Right ventricular refractory periods were not modified by celiprolol (mean effective period 289 +/- 20 ms before versus 294 +/- 20 ms after). Following a hospital stay of 17 +/- 7 days, the beta-blocker was discontinued in 5 patients because of persistence of permanent tachycardia in 1 case, and because of inducibility of a tachycardia with the same frequency as before treatment in the other 4 cases. No sudden death or haemodynamically unstable recurrence of ventricular tachycardia were observed during follow-up over a period of 38 +/- 24 months (range: 2-55) of the 7 patients in whom treatment was considered to be effective. Only one patient presented a temporary and reversible deterioration of heart failure. The absence of excessive bradycardia was also observed during follow-up. In one patient, celiprolol was replaced by another antiarrhythmic due to the recrudescence of inducibility to programmed stimulation. Three patients developed a spontaneous recurrence of sustained monomorphie ventricular tachycardia, which was well tolerated. In conclusion, these results suggest that celiprolol in combination with amiodarone in the treatment of refractory chronic ventricular tachycardia is a valuable therapeutic option because of its good inotropic and particularly chronotropic safety. However, the efficacy of treatment must be evaluated by a stress test and by endocavitary electrophysiological investigation including programmed ventricular stimulation in every case.", 
    "108": "The main objective of this thesis was to estimate the prevalence of subjectively perceived dry mouth, xerostomia, in a representative general adult population, and the possible co-morbidity between xerostomia and on-going pharmacotherapy. Further, to evaluate the effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on saliva flow rate and composition. The prevalence of xerostomia was evaluated by means of a questionnaire mailed to a random sample of 4.200 adult subjects living in the southern part of the province of Halland, Sweden. Three hundred men and equally many women aged 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 years were selected from the national census register. From 3311 (81%) evaluable questionnaires was concluded that, in the studied population, 21.3% of the men and 27.3% of the women reported xerostomia. The difference between the sexes was statistically significant, women reporting higher prevalence of dry mouth than men. It was also found that xerostomia was significantly age-related. Further, it was demonstrated that there was a strong co-morbidity between reported prevalence of dry mouth and on-going pharmacotherapy. Generally, no specific drug or drug-group proved to be especially xerogenic, rather, polypharmacy was strongly correlated to reported symptoms of dry mouth, and it was also a significant correlation between increasing xerostomia and the number of medications taken. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on saliva flow rate and composition were evaluated both in healthy volunteers and in hypertensive patients. The effects of one week of treatment with the non-selective (propranolol) and the beta 1-selective (atenolol) adrenoceptor antagonists were compared with that of placebo in three different clinical trials, including 38, 11 and 19 healthy volunteers, respectively. Two of these studies were focused on the effects on whole saliva secretion rate and composition and the third study on the secretions from the parotid and the submandibular-sublingual glands. Salivary composition but not saliva flow rates were affected by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, and the most pronounced effects were observed for total protein composition and amylase activity, both being significantly decreased during treatment with any of the antagonists, however, more accentuated during treatment with atenolol. Twelve hypertensive patients who were well-controlled in their blood-pressure by means of monotherapy with metoprolol, a beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, were observed during four weeks of withdrawal and after re-exposure to this antihypertensive treatment. The observed effects on salivary composition were essentially the same as those found in healthy volunteers. In the hypertensive group, however, whole saliva flow rates increased significantly on drug withdrawal and decreased again on re-exposure to metoprolol.", 
    "109": "Norepinephrine, that has been released from sympathetic nerve endings in response to myocardial ischemia, may have either a beneficial or a harmful effect on the ischemic heart. If the duration of ischemia is short, the release of norepinephrine may be favorable for the production of energy and for protection of the heart against ischemic damage. If the duration of ischemia is prolonged, there is a marked increase in number of both alpha 1 and beta-adrenoceptors located in the sarcolemmal membrane, as well as an excessive increase in release of norepinephrine. These events during the prolonged period of ischemia can produce an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand, which is harmful to the heart. The anti-ischemic effect of alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is not attributed merely to improvement of oxygen balance, but reduction of phospholipase activity or stabilization of membrane may also be important as an underlying mechanism.", 
    "110": "We recently reported a highly stereoselective increase in plasma concentrations of (S)-atenolol during exercise which is most likely due to a release of the drug from adrenergic cells. The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of physical exercise on plasma concentrations of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of propranolol.", 
    "111": "Blood samples were taken immediately before and at the end of exercise in 12 patients receiving chronic treatment with racemic (R, S)-propranolol. Plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-propranolol were determined by HPLC.", 
    "112": "In contrast to atenolol, mean plasma concentrations of (S)-propranolol were significantly higher (+20%) than those of (R)-propranolol at rest. During exercise there was an increase in plasma concentrations of both (R)-propranolol (+129%) and (S)-propranolol (+109%).", 
    "113": "Based on information from in vitro studies we conclude that the increase in plasma concentrations of (S)-propranolol during exercise is caused by a release of the drug from adrenergic nerves, whereas the reason for the increase in (R)-propranolol remains to be determined. This release of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking (S)-enantiomer directly at the synaptic gaps might be one reason for the poor correlation between plasma concentration and effect of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists repeatedly described in the literature.", 
    "114": "beta 3-adrenoceptors have been described through both molecular and pharmacological studies. In this context, it has been characterized the beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist activity of a new compound (Trecadrine), and evaluated whether it exhibits additional activity at beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes. In addition, it has been tested its potential anti-diabetic properties in a model of alloxan-induced diabetes in rats. Our data show that Trecadrine induces oesophageal muscularis mucosae relaxation, indicating a putative action on beta 3-adrenoceptors. In the absence of beta 3-adrenoceptor antagonists, assays with beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic antagonists reveal a quite remarkable selectivity for beta 3-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, it has been suggested that this molecule has hypoglycaemic and lipomobilizing effects, although hypoglycaemia was not related to an increase in insulin secretion in diabetic rats. It is concluded that Trecadrine mainly acts through beta 3-adrenoceptors, and it may constitute a potential drug in the treatment of diabetes.", 
    "115": "Lungs from near-term fetal guinea-pigs were supported in vitro for 3 h; lung liquid production was measured by a dye-dilution method using Blue Dextran 2000 (fetuses 62 +/- 2 days of gestation, 97.6 +/- 19.0 (SD) g body weight; n = 134). Untreated control preparations produced fluid at 1.30 +/- 0.22 ml/kg body weight per h, and showed no significant changes during incubation (n = 30). After 1 h of incubation, experimental lungs were expanded with Krebs-Henseleit saline in volumes estimated to be below or approximating those of the first breath (n = 30; first breath, 0.6-1.2 ml). Expansions were graded at 18 +/- 4%, 31 +/- 4%, 43 +/- 3%, 50 +/- 3% and 72 +/- 2% of lung volume (volumes used for expansion at the maximal level, 0.64 +/- 0.25 ml). All expansions of 31% or above produced reductions in fluid production significant by analysis of variance (P < 0.01-0.001); production halted at 50% expansion, and there was strong reabsorption at 72% expansion (-0.87 +/- 0.45 ml/kg body weight per h by the final hour). There was an exponential relationship between percentage expansion and percentage fall in production (r = 1.00). There was no evidence for excessive pressure, and no evidence for lung damage as judged by electron microscopy or entry of intracellular materials into the fluid (lactic dehydrogenase, protein, K+). In studies based on 36 preparations, 10(-6) M amiloride present in the lung lumen (apically) abolished the reabsorptions seen at 70 +/- 3% expansion, but not the arrest of production; it had no effect on control preparations. Studies based on 24 preparations showed that responses to 72 +/- 2% expansion were not affected by 10(-7) M propranolol placed in the outer saline. In studies of 14 fetuses of widely different body weights (68.3-124.9 g), responses to 74 +/- 2% expansion showed an exponential increase with increasing body weight (r = 0.96). Although caution is needed, the results suggest that expansion of the lungs at birth may induce fluid reabsorption by an action independent of tissues outside the lungs, probably involving both activation of a Na(+)-based reabsorptive system and arrest of production, but not requiring beta-receptor activation. The probability that the responses are maximal at birth is discussed, and it is suggested that the effect of expansion may be a specialization of the perinatal lung.", 
    "116": "5-HT-Moduline (Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu) is a new endogenous peptide purified from rat brain which interacts specifically with 5-HT1B/1D receptors. The binding interaction of 5-HT-Moduline with 5-HT1B/1D receptors appeared to be a non-competitive process, since the Bmax value of [125I] cyanopindolol binding on rat brain cortical membranes was decreased without modification of the Kd. This interaction was conserved on NIH 3T3 cells expressing the 5-HT1B receptor (IC50 = 10(-11)M) suggesting that the binding site for 5-HT-Moduline is localized on the 5-HT1B receptor protein. The observed interaction may lead to functional alterations of 5-HT1B/1D receptors known to play an important role in regulating the release of 5-HT from serotonergic nerve terminals (autoreceptors) as well as the release of other neurotransmitters (heteroreceptors).", 
    "117": "In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine, 5-HT induced a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect in isolated guinea-pig atrium preparation. Both propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, and imipramine, a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, did not affect the response induced by 5-HT, indicating that a tyramine-like mechanism is not involved. The positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT was mimicked by several 5-HT3 receptor agonists. N omega-Methyl-5-HT, reported to have a high affinity for 5-HT1B recognition sites, was found to act as a 5-HT3 receptor agonist with higher efficacy. The other 5-HT receptor agonists tested did not produced any responses. The positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT was inhibited by various 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as tropisetron, granisetron, ondansetron, cisapride and zacopride, but it was unaffected by various 5-HT receptor antagonists which are not selective for 5-HT3 receptor. Thus, the positive chronotropic response to 5-HT is a direct effect, and it was suggested to be mediated by 5-HT3 receptor subtype with rather an atypical profile.", 
    "118": "We generated dose-response data for the endogenous and ultra-short-acting hallucinogen, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), in a cohort of experienced hallucinogen users, measuring multiple biological and psychological outcome measures. Subjective responses were quantified with a new rating scale, the HRS, which provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables. A tolerance study then was performed, in which volunteers received four closely spaced hallucinogenic doses of DMT. Subjective responses demonstrated no tolerance, while biological measures were inconsistently reduced over the course of the sessions. Thus, DMT remains unique among classic hallucinogens in its inability to induce tolerance to its psychological effects. To assess the role of the 5-HT1A site in mediating DMT's effects, a pindolol pre-treatment study was performed. Pindolol significantly increased psychological responses to DMT, suggesting a buffering effect of 5-HT1A agonism on 5-HT2-mediated psychedelic effects. These data are opposite to those described in lower animal models of hallucinogens' mechanisms of action.", 
    "119": "We studied the effects of caffeine on intracellular calcium in a clonal insulin-secreting cell line RINm5F. Caffeine (1-30 mM) induced a dose-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx. Pretreatment with combination of ryanodine (10 microM) and caffeine (10 mM), but not ryanodine alone, abolished subsequent caffeine-induced release of intracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment with another ryanodine receptor blocker procaine (0.1, 0.3, and 1mM) antagonized the caffeine-induced release of intracellular Ca2+. Pretreatment with thapsigargin (2 microM), the endoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, abolished both the caffeine- and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced Ca2+ release. AVP induces Ca2+ release by increasing the formation of IP3. Pretreatment with AVP greatly reduced caffeine-induced Ca2+ release whereas pretreatment with caffeine also reduced AVP-induced Ca2+ release. The L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine (1 microM) inhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ influx. In addition, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores with thapsigargin did not affect caffeine-induced Ca2+ influx. These results suggested that: 1) the ryanodine- and caffeine-sensitive Ca2+ store exists in RINm5F cells, 2) most of these Ca2+ release channels in RINm5F cells are closed in the resting state, since pretreatment with ryanodine alone failed to block the caffeine-induced Ca2+ release, 3) there is a \"cross-talk\" between the caffeine- and IP3-sensitive pools in RINm5F cells, 4) caffeine increases Ca2+ entry in RINm5F cells through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and 5) the caffeine-induced Ca2+ influx is independent of the Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores.", 
    "120": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have emerged as the class of antihypertensive and vasodilatatory agents of first choice in the treatment of elderly patients with hypertension. Normotensive patients with congestive heart failure, post-anterior myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus with evidence of microangiopathy will also benefit from continuous ACE inhibition. The long term use of ACE inhibitors is associated with improved survival and reduced cardiovascular, cerebral and renal morbidity in these patients. In elderly atherosclerotic patients, these agents provide good control of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and peripheral resistance, with remarkable preservation of vital organ perfusion and infrequent adverse effects. Used as monotherapy, the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors is limited. However, there are advantages for using them in combination with other drugs, notably thiazide diuretics, nitrates and calcium antagonists. Renal function is thus preserved and left heart hypertrophy is prevented. There are no major differences between the various ACE inhibitors, and the choice of drug is largely a matter of personal preference.", 
    "121": "Influence of hemodynamic changes in preload, afterload and contractility on myocardial integrated backscatter (IB) was studied in 26 adult mongrel dogs by measuring myocardial IB calibrated with the backscatter from the blood during volume infusion (preload alteration), during aortic constriction (afterload alteration), and during dobutamine or propranolol infusion (contractility alteration). Changes in preload, afterload or contractility did not significantly affect the calibrated myocardial IB either in the septum or in the posterior wall. Changes in preload and afterload did not affect the magnitude of cyclic variation in IB. However, dobutamine produced a significant increase in the magnitude of cyclic variation in IB and propranolol significantly decreased the magnitude of cyclic variation in IB. These data indicated that the calibrated myocardial IB is independent of preload, afterload and contractility, and that the magnitude of cyclic variation in IB is influenced by contractility. We may estimate static (related to histological changes such as fibrosis, edema, necrosis, and so on) and dynamic (related to myocardial contraction such as sarcomere length, muscle fiber orientation, and so on) properties of the myocardium more precisely using myocardial IB calibrated with the backscatter from the blood in addition to the magnitude of cyclic variation in IB.", 
    "122": "An important aspect of antihypertensive drug treatment is quality of life (QL) which should at least not be negatively affected. In this study, the QL during treatment with carvedilol (C), a beta-blocker with vasodilating properties due to alpha-1-receptor blockade, was compared to that of enalapril (E) in patients who had responded to the treatment.", 
    "123": "Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95-115 mmHg) were randomised to receive either E(n = 119) of C(n = 129) in a double-blind multicenter study.

If insufficient blood pressure (BP) control was found at 50 mg C or 40 mg E, 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide was added. After having reached the goal BP the patients entered a 5-months maintenance period. General well-being was evaluated by the \"G\u00f6teborg Quality of Life Questionnaire\".", 
    "124": "Equally many patients in the respective treatment groups responded at the different dose levels. Diastolic BP after 5 months in the maintenance period was similar on C and E, respectively. For most items, QL was not affected by the treatments. An increased incidence of cough was perceived in the E group (p < 0.001). None of the C treated patients reported frequent cough at the end of the study compared with 12% of E treated patients.",
