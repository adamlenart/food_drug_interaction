    "0": "MK-761 is a new class of compound which has beta adrenoceptor antagonist and vasodilating properties in a single molecule. The compound has in vitro beta adrenoceptor blocking activity in the isolated cat heart papillary muscle and isolated rat atria. Unlike propranolol, it did not depress contactile force. Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity was not observed in vitro, (isolated cat papillary muscle, isolated atria) but the compound has some intrinsic sympathomimetric activity because it slightly increased heart rate in reserpinized rats. MK-761 was found to be approximately as potent as timolol and pindolol in blocking cardiac and vascular beta adrenergic receptors in anesthetized dogs. The drug was not, however, cardioselective. Oral beta adrenoceptor blocking activity was observed in rats at doses similar to those which decreased blood pressure.", 
    "1": "The effect of verapamil on automaticity and conduction in the atrioventricular (A-V) junctional region was studied in anesthetized dogs. In five normal dogs verapamil, 10 microgram/ml, was selectively perfused into the A-V nodal artery and caused first degree heart block, which progressed to second degree heart block in three of the five. Higher concentrations of verapamil, 25 microgram/ml, caused complete heart block in three of five other dogs, but no episodes of asystole (defined as a ventricular pause of 10 or more seconds). In six other dogs after beta receptor blockade with propranolol, 20 microgram/ml, perfused into the A-V nodal artery, verapamil, 10 microgram/ml, regularly caused second degree heart block; in four of the six dogs there was a transient episode of third degree A-V block, and in two of these there was a period of asystole. In each of the 10 dogs pretreated with reserpine, verapamil, 10 microgram/ml, caused third degree A-V block; in seven of these there was a period of asystole with ventricular standstill up to 30 seconds. Concentrations of verapamil that do not produce high grade heart block in the normal heart thus readily cause both high grade block and prolonged ventricular standstill after elimination of adrenergic influences in the A-V junction.", 
    "2": "Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma renin activity, plasma norepinephrine and plasma epinephrine were determined in 11 patients with essential hypertension at rest before and 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after an intravenous infusion of 0.12 mg./Kg. propranolol given over five minutes. After propranolol mean blood pressure was unchanged; heart rate decreased by 14 per cent within 15 minutes and showed no further changes. Plasma renin activity decreased progressively by 48 per cent 60 minutes after propranolol, whereas plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were always higher after propranolol than control values. Increases in norepinephrine were statistically significant at 30, 45, and 60 minutes (respectively 49, 39, and 45 per cent, P less than 0.005 at least) and those of epinephrine even at 15 minutes (respectively 60, 82, 62, and 94 per cent P less than 0.01 for all). These results indicate that acute beta blockade with propranolol incudes increases in circulating plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine which might be consequent to rapidly induced hemodynamic changes. This augmented sympathetic activity might explain why propranolol, when acutely infused, does not decrease blood pressure despite effective cardiac and renin blockade.", 
    "3": "68 patients with angina pectoris were treated 14 days with placebo and four weeks with 15 mg/die pindolol (Visken) in a double blind multicenter study. The patients were divided into two groups at random: group I received pindolol/placebo, group II pacebo/pindolol. Pindolol reduced in both groups significantly the number and intensity of angina pectoris attacks and the consumption of nitroglycerin capsules. There was no evidence for a rebound phenomenon after abrupt cessation of pindolol treatment. In the wash out period still a relevant antianginous effect of the beta-blocker could be observed. The oxygen demand of the myocardium was reduced by reduction of systolic blood pressure and heart rate whereas diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. The tolerance of the preparation was good.", 
    "4": "The tolerance and antihypertensive action of acebutolol, as a sole drug and in combination with a diuretic, were studied in a population of 34 female subjects aged over 65 years, with a mean of 81 years, suffering from well tolerated essential hypertension. The study was carried out in the form of double blind permutations, each subject receiving successively in an order determined by random selection each of three therapeutic phases: acebutolol, acebutolol in combination with a diuretic and a placebo. The results showed that in the elderly acebutolol had a moderate diuretic action which was remarkably potentialised by diuretics. The tolerance of this beta-blocker was excellent: no cases of cardiac failure, and no disturbances in atrioventricular conduction developed during the phases with active treatment.", 
    "5": "The therapeutic efficacy of propranolol in four and two daily doses was compared in 63 treated hypertensive patients in a multicentre trial. After 3 months of a stable diastolic blood pressure while receiving propranolol four times a day the patients were switched to a twice-a-day regimen, the drug being given at 8 am and 8 pm, with the same total daily dose, for 3 more months. Blood pressures and heart rates were measured at 8 am, 12 noon, 4 pm and 8 pm at 4-week intervals. There were no significant changes in mean blood pressure after the change to the twice-a-day regimen, although some patients reported new side effects. Compliance appeared to be unaffected.", 
    "6": "Increased sensitivity to phenylephrin and a decreased one to isoproterenol has been found in regional vascular beds of GC implanted rats. Circulatory sympathetic reflex adaptation, alfa- and beta-adrenergic stimulation or blockade provoked a uniform response pattern: i.e. increase in vascular resistance of GC.", 
    "7": "In the isolated and perfused kidney of the rat, the stimulant effect of dopamine on renin release is blocked by propranolol and not by haloperidol. This suggests that the release of renin induced by dopamine is due to the activation of beta-receptors.", 
    "8": "The ethanol withdrawal syndrome in man and animals is characterized by signs of CNS hyperactivity although a direct measurement of a physiological variable reflecting this CNS hyperactivity has never been performed in untreated man or in animals. We induced ethanol dependence in the rat by means of intragastric intubation with a 20% w/v ethanol solution, thus keeping the animals in a state of continuous severe intoxication for 3--4 days; during the subsequent state of withdrawal characterized by tremor, rigidity, stereotyped movements and general seizures a 25% increase in cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) could be measured; this increase was not due to catecholamines originating from adrenal medulla as adrenomedullectomized animals showed a similar increase in CMRO2 (28%); the withdrawing animals showed a corresponding cerebral blood flow (CBF) increase. The elevated CMRO2 and CBF could be reduced to normal by administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol 2 mg/kg i.v.), and hence the increased CMRO2 during ethanol withdrawal could be related to catecholaminergic systems in the brain, e.g. the noradrenergic locus coeruleus system which is anatomically well suited as a general activating system. This interpretation is supported by the earlier neurochemical finding of an increased cerebral noradrenaline turnover during ethanol withdrawal. The exact mechanism underlying the increased cerebral oxygen consumption during ethanol withdrawal and the effect of propranolol on cerebral function during this condition remains to be clarified.", 
    "9": "To assess the clinical usefulness of radionuclide-determined changes in pulmonary blood volume in patients with or without substantial coronary-artery disease, we determined the ratio of pulmonary blood volume at rest as compared with that during exercise. We used multigated blood-pool images obtained at rest and during supine exercise to determine the blood-volume ratio in patients subsequently undergoing coronary arteriography for evaluation of chest pain. Exercise tests were performed by use of a submaximal-workload protocol, although all tests were limited according to each patient's symptoms. The mean exercise/rest pulmonary-blood-volume ratios were lower for persons without coronary-artery disease (0.94 +/- 0.06 [S.D.], 10 patients) and for those with disease confined to the right coronary artery (0.99 +/- 0.12, five patients), as compared with all others with coronary-artery disease (1.14 +/- 0.15, 37 patients) (P less than 0.01). A pulmonary-blood-volume ratio equal to or greater than 1.06 had a sensitivity of 79 per cent. Patients with coronary-artery disease not confined to the right coronary artery usually show an increase in pulmonary blood volume during supine exercise. No such change occurs in persons without coronary-artery disease.", 
    "10": "Antagonist binding to the beta-adrenergic receptor is largely entropy driven, with only a small enthalpy component. The binding of agonists, on the other hand, is associated with a large decrease in enthalpy which permits a highly unfavourable decrease in entropy. The thermodynamic differences between the binding of agonists and antagonists may provide new insights into the molecular basis for hormone stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity.", 
    "11": "The effects of a single dose and of two equally divided doses of timolol were compared in a double-blind trial in 15 patients with essential hypertension. The amount of timolol per day remained constant for each patient, but individual patients received different amounts (from 10 mg to 30 mg/day). Timolol combined with a diuretic produced similar lowering of blood pressure in patients who required 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg of timolol per day when given either as one dose or in two equal doses. Plasma concentrations of timolol were high enough to be a major contributing factor to the long duration of the hypotensive response.", 
    "12": "In ten healthy volunteers infusion of 7 micrograms/kg orciprenaline produced typical changes in carbohydrate and fat metabolism due to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Pretreatment with intravenously administered propranolol or metoprolol significantly inhibited orciprenaline-induced changes in systolic blood pressure, heart rate and plasma FFA, potassium, glucose and glycerol levels. Propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) seemed to be more effective than metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) even in inhibiting predominantly beta 1-adrenergic responses.", 
    "13": "It was demonstrated that Ledakrin, an antitumour drug, causes mobilization of free fatty acids and glycerol from the epididymal adipose tissue of rat in vitro. The disproportion observed in the release of glycerol and free fatty acids following Ledakrin administration suggested a biphasic effect of this drug, with initial stimulation and later inhibition of the processes of lipolysis and lipogenesis. Blockade of adrenergic membrane receptors (with propranolol or regitine) abolished the lipolytic effect of Ledakrin.", 
    "14": "Efferent activity was recorded from nerve filaments dissected from the sympathetic nerve branches to the adrenal gland (adrenal nerve). An infusion of isoproterenol into the carotid artery suppressed the discharge of the adrenal nerve as did an equal dose of epinephrine whereas systemic blood pressure descended after isoproterenol injection. The beta blocking agent inhibited the suppression after epinephrine and isoproterenol application. The results suggest the existence of reflex inhibition of adrenal nerve activity through beta adrenergic receptors besides that of baroreceptors.", 
    "15": "Sensitivity to norepinephrine (expressed as pD2) was different between the prostatic and the epididymal half of the rat vas deferens. The epididymal half was more sensitive than the prostatic half; difference in pD2 was 0.826 +/- 0.095 (mean +/- S.E., 13 experiments). Between the two halves, nearly the same difference in pD2, 0.745 +/- 0.125 (6 experiments), was observed in the responses to methoxamine, which is not incorporated into the adrenergic nerve terminals. In the two halves, 3 x 10(-6) M phentolamine produced a smiliar decrease in pD2 of norepinephrine: 1.485 +/- 0.056 and 1.282 +/- 0.080 in the prostatic and epididymal half, respectively (6 experiments). Only in the prostatic half, 10(-5) M propranolol produced a slight increase in pD2 of norepinephrine, 0.344 +/- 0.133 (6 experiments). Sensitivity to K+ was also different between the two halves. These results suggest that the difference in the sensitivity to norepinephrine between the prostatic and the epididymal half is due to postjunctional natures varying along the length of the rat vas deferens.", 
    "16": "Dopamine (DA) and several blocking substances were administered into the 3rd ventricle of conscious goats to study the effects on water and electrolyte excretion. Intracerebroventricular infusion of DA in hydrated goats induced a significant dose-dependent inhibition of both the urine flow rate and the renal free water clearance. A biphasic response pattern of urinary electrolyte excretion, consisting of an initial fall, followed by an increase in the excretion rate was observed. The antidiuretic effects induced by DA could be prevented by prior administration of haloperidol, pimozide or phentolamine into the 3rd ventricle. Atropine, hexamethonium or propranolol were ineffective. It seems that excitatory responses of periventricular neurons resulting in vasopressin release in the goat may be mediated by both alpha-adrenoceptors and excitatory DA receptors. Furthermore, single injection of haloperidol or pimozide into the 3rd ventricle of goats with a normal water balance induced both a significant diuretic response and an increase in renal free water clearance. The data suggest that endogenous DA in the hypothalamus could be responsible for vasopressin release.", 
    "17": "The effects on arterial pressure of saralasin and short-term (seven days) administration of the cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol were compared in 21 patients with various forms of hypertension. During saralasin administration mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 8.8 +/- 2.1 per cent. Atenolol administration was associated with a MAP fall of 23.6 +/- 2.9 per cent. The change in MAP induced by atenolol was higher than that produced by saralasin (P less than 0.001) and no significant correlation (r = 0.40, P greater than 0.05) between their respective effects was found. These results suggest that the antihypertensive action of atenolol is not related to pre-treatment activity of the renin-angiotensin system as estimated by the hypotensive effect of saralasin. Other mechanisms should be sought in order to explain the effectiveness of this betablocker in hypertensive patients.", 
    "18": "Sinus node preparations from mice were hydraulically compressed at 10, 100, and 500 atm x min-1 in Tyrode's solution at 27 degrees C. At the highest compression rate, both a delay and a more pronounced beating frequency response to pressure was seen. The delayed reaction is ascribed to either adiabatic effects or a time-delay in conformational changes in the pacemaker cell membrane. The potentiating effect of a high compression rate could be eliminated by autonomic blockade (atropine and practolol).", 
    "19": "A newborn baby shows atrial tachycardia and gets into cardiac failure by atrial fibrillation at 12 weeks of age. With digoxin and chinidin spontaneous conversion to multifocal atrial tachycardia occurs. Treatment with additional propranolol leads to atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. When chinidin was discontinued atrial flutter occurred. With a maintenance therapy with digoxin and chinidin the baby remained asymptomatic, and sinusrhythm occurred at 6 months of age. At 9 months chinidin was discontinued. At 14 months of age, the child is well and in sinusrhythm with a maintenance digoxin therapy. This seems to be the third described case of multifocal atrial tachycardia in infancy.", 
    "20": "The relationships between lung compliance, surface tension, and cholesterol during stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system were studied in 28 cats. Cats were anesthetized with ketamine hydrocholoride, injected with one of five sympathetic blocking agents or inhibitors and injected with isoprotenol. The left stellate ganglion was then stimulated electrically for 5 min. We found that stimulation decreased lung compliance and increased the surface tension and the cholesterol concentration in the lung wash fluid. Alpha blockers (phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine) and catecholamine inhibitors (reserpine and guanethidine) prevented these changes, but the beta blocker practolol did not. In additional experiments airway resistance, functional residual capacity and lung weights did not change during stellate stimulation. The results from the present study suggest that stellate ganglion stimulation resulted in decreased lung compliance with an increased surface tension and cholesterol in lung wash fluid.", 
    "21": "A patient treated for hypertension with labetalol developed left ventricular failure. When the drug was withdrawn and the BP controlled with 2 other agents, the signs of heart failure regressed. The ill effects in this case could have been because the beta-blocking effects of labetalol are 4 to 6 times greater than the alpha-blocking effects. Caution should be exercised when prescribing this drug for patients with heart failure or with previous symptoms.", 
    "22": "Twenty cases of acute intermittent porphyria were studied during the acute phase. Cardiovascular manifestations were noted in all the cases, with tachycardia in 20 and with hypertension in 17. Propranolol in doses ranging from 20--200 mg was given to all the cases and produced adequate control of tachycardia and hypertension. At follow-up, smaller doses of propranolol were found to maintain the pulse rate and BP within normal limits and also to prevent acute attacks.", 
    "23": "Beta-adrenergic blockade by oral propanolol in five cirrhotic patients caused changes in the handling of an acute sodium load. Fractional sodium excretion following an acute saline load increased from 0.69% +/- 0.29 to 1.49% +/- 0.11 (103 microEq/min +/- 7.5 to 129 microEq/min +/- 18) before propranolol administration. After 3 days of oral propanolol 1 mg/kg day, the fractional excretion of sodium by saline loading increased from 0.52% +/- 0.19 to 2.17 +/- 0.19 (109 microEq/min +/- 9 to 178 microEq/min +/- 11). This change was not accompanied by changes in GFR, RPF or in the renin-aldosterone system. The possibility that these changes are caused by a change in the sodium transport at the tubular cell level induced by the beta-adrenergic blockade, is entertained.", 
    "24": "The effects of metoprolol 1 mg kg-1 i.v. on the systemic and coronary circulations and on myocardial performance were studied in nine open-chested dogs ventilated with halothane 0.8% in oxygen at normocarbia. In terms of the chronotropic effect, this dose of metoprolol produced a substantial shift to the right of the dose-response curve to isoprenaline; substantial reductions of arterial pressure (10%), cardiac output (21%), aortic blood acceleration (13%), left ventricular dP/dt max (13%) and left ventricular power (25%) were observed. Both preload, represented by left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and afterload, represented by systemic vascular resistance, increased. Left circumflex coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption decreased by approximately the same amount as peak ventricular power.", 
    "25": "In 2 patients with phaeochromocytoma, effective beta-blockade was obtained with propranolol (40 mg twice a day for 3 days) or acebutolol (400 mg twice a day for 3 days) without any effect on the blood pressure. In both patients the excretion of noradrenaline predominated over that of adrenaline, a picture found in most cases of phaeochromocytoma. A hypertensive response to beta-blockade might be expected in patients with an adrenaline-secreting tumour. It cannot be a regular event or constitute a diagnostic test in patients with suspected phaeochromocytoma.", 
    "26": "Acebutolol ('Sectral'), a cardioselective beta-blocking drug, was administered intravenously in a dose of 25 mg to 10 patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. All of them were in a stable condition on antifailure regimens. The drug resulted in a statistically significant decline in left ventricular contractility as judged by peak left ventricular dP/dT and the contractility index. The mean aortic blood pressure also fell. There was a significant increase in end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes. Mean values for heart rate, ejection fraction, left ventricular stroke work index, and cardiac output also fell, but the results were not statistically significant. Left ventricular distensibility as judged by the slope of the diastolic pressure-volume relation also improved significantly. A reduction in myocardial energy requirements, improved compliance, and lowering of arterial pressure would be haemodynamically advantageous. However, further cardiac dilatation and reduction contractility--the basic defects in congestive cardiomyopathy--could lead to further deterioration.", 
    "27": "Methods currently used to quantitate myocardial damage and necrosis produced by chemicals are usually time consuming and subjective. These studies were conducted to evaluate the utility of 3H-tetracycline as a means of quantitating myocardial necrosis produced by isoproterenol. Male, Sprague-Dawley derived rats (180-200 g) were treated with (+/-)-isoproterenol HCl (0.1-100 mg/kg, s.c.) or equivalent volumes of saline. After 90 minutes, all rats received 50 uCi/kg of 3H-tetracycline. Rats were sacrificed 3 hours after 3H-tetracycline administration and the hearts were removed and rinsed free of blood. The degree of radioactivity of the heart as determined by liquid scintillation counting was directly proportional to the dose of isoproterenol. Propranolol pretreatment decreased the accumulation of radioactivity in a dose-dependent fashion. Determination of 3H-tetracycline accumulation appears to be a rapid and reliable method for quantitating isoproterenol-induced myocardial necrosis.", 
    "28": "The effects of l-penbutolol and dl-propranolol on A-V conduction, on excitability of ventricular muscle, and on ventricular tachycardia threshold in acute ischemia were compared, using anesthetized dogs. 1. L-penbutolol (100 microgram/Kg) and dl-propranolol (100 microgram/Kg) prolonged A-V conduction and reduced excitability of ventricular muscle significantly. L-penbutolol less prolonged A-V conduction than dl-propranolol. 2. Both l-penbutolol (50 microgram/Kg) and dl-propranolol (50 microgram/Kg) significantly prevented the lowering of ventricular tachycardia threshold in acute ischemia. These beta-blocking drugs are effective in the treatment of arrhythmia and l-penbutolol could be used safely, because of its weaker inhibition on A-V conduction.", 
    "29": "Two improvements in propranolol resolution were developed. Both the (+)- and (-)-di-(p-toluoyl)tartaric acids were used as the resolving agents. This procedure reduced the number of crystallizations needed to obtain a pure product. Furthermore, synthesis of the resolving agent was improved.", 
    "30": "The relationship between plasma propranolol concentration and relief of essential tremor was examined in 11 patients during treatment with oral racemic propranolol in doses of 30 to 640 mg/day. Although propranolol decreased tremor in all 11 patients, the degree of improvement varied widely in individuals (mean 51%, range 25--90%), and was not related directly occurred at plasma propranolol concentrations below 20 ng/ml (0.077 mumol/l) and, in three others, below 40 ng/ml (0.154 mumol/l). It is concluded that the optimum response of essential tremor to propranolol is achieved at relatively low plasma propranolol levels, levels which are obtained by daily propranolol doses of 120--240 mg.", 
    "31": "Treatment of five hypertriglyceridemic and one normolipemic patients with propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocking agent, and metoprolol, which is generally considered to be a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, was observed to produce a further elevation in their triglyceride levels. The subjects were followed for 20 weeks, during which they received propranolol for eight weeks, a placebo for four weeks and metoprolol for eight weeks in a crossover design. The analysis suggested that the increase in triglyceride levels was less pronounced with the more cardioselective agent. Moreover, alpha-cholesterol decreased significantly after propranolol but remained constant while on metoprolol. Both drugs decreased beta-cholesterol whereas chylo- and pre- beta-cholesterol increased, particularly with propranolol. Considering the contradictory evidence regarding the clinical importance of chronic elevation of plasma triglyceride and decreased alpha- und beta-cholesterol concentrations, it is suggested that a cardioselective drug would be presently preferable in hyperlipidemic subjects.", 
    "32": "The effects of clonidine were assessed on conditioned avoidance responses (CAR) in control, 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA)- and vehicle-treated rats, using a shuttle box device. Clonidine (100--400 micrograms/kg) produced a significant decrease of CAR in control and vehicle-treated animals. On the other hand, avoidance responding was only slightly inhibited in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Pretreatment with the alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs yohimbine or phentolamine (1--8 mg/kg) prevented the CAR disrupting effects of clonidine. When animals were pretreated with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol (1--8 mg/kg) the ensuing injection of clonidine caused a greater CAR depression. Our results further support the hypothesis relating the conditioned performance depression observed after clonidine to the activation of a presynaptic negative feedback mechanism mediated by alpha-adrenoceptors. It is also suggested that propranolol increases the clonidine inhibition through the blockade of a positive feedback mechanism dependent on the activation of presynaptic beta-receptors.", 
    "33": "Propranolol was found to share the properties of the racemate in facilitating habituation of the electrodermal orienting reflex in schizophrenic patients. This effect appeared independent of influences on levels of skin conductance and non-specific responses. Chlorpromazine did not normalise orienting activity. If the findings from open clinical studies that D-propranolol has anti-psychotic properties are confirmed, the fact that dextro propranolol has only minimal cardiovascular effects may give it important advantages as an anti-psychotic agent. Controlled clinical studies to prove its therapeutic action and neurobiological studies to determine its central mechanisms of action are warranted.", 
    "34": "The metabolic hydroxylation of 4'-deuteriooxprenolol [1-(isopropylamino)-3-[2'-(allyloxy)-4'-deuteriophenoxy]-2-propanol] prepared from the 4'-bromo compound was examined in the rat (in vivo). GC-MS analysis of the 4'-and 5'-hydroxyoxprenolol obtained showed 65% retention of deuterium in each of the metabolites. The results indicate that an arene oxide-NIH shift pathway is operative in these hydroxylation processes. The equal magnitude of deuterium retention is supportive of a 4',5'-arene oxide as a major contributor to their formation.", 
    "35": "The metabolic aromatic hydroxylation of oxprenolol [1-(isopropylamino)-3-[2'-(allyloxy)phenoxy]-2-propanol] in rats was examined. Synthesis of the isomeric ring methoxyoxprenolols (3b-6b) was accomplished from the isomeric methoxysalicylaldehydes by O-allylation, followed by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. The propanolamine side chain was elaborated by O-alkylation of the Bayer-Villiger product with epichlorohydrin and subsequent oxirane opening with isopropylamine. Gas chromatography-mass spectra of the trifluoroacetyl derivatives of these standards was compared with urinary metabolites obtained from the rat, after methylation with diazomethane and derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride. Both 4'- and 5'-hydroxyoxprenolol (4a and 5a) were present in an approximate 4:1 ratio. No 3'- or 6'-hydroxyoxprenolol (3a and 6a) was detected. The metabolites obtained from a human urine treated in the same manner gave similar results with both 4a and 5a present.", 
    "36": "The epithelium of canine trachea maintains a transepithelial potential difference (lumen negative relative to submucosa) by active transport of Cl- toward the lumen and of Na+ away from the lumen. This study examined the effects of terbutaline (a beta-adrenergic agonist) on short-circuit current, potential difference, electrical conductance, and fluxes of 36Cl and 24Na measured across pieces of canine trachea mounted in Ussing-type chambers. In short-circuited tissues, 10(-5) M terbutaline increased unidirectional Cl- flux toward the lumen from 4.78 +/- 1.12 (mean +/- SEM) to 6.28 +/- 1.06 muEq/cm2.h. The other measured fluxes did not change significantly. Increases in unidirectional Cl- flux toward the lumen were related to terbutaline concentration (range, 10(-7) to 10(-5) M); 10(-6) M propranolol prevented or decreased these effects. These studies suggest that terbutaline acts via beta-adrenergic receptors to increase active transport of Cl- toward the lumen.", 
    "37": "In an eight-week study, timolol maleate ophthalmic solution 0.25% was administered twice daily with either pilocarpine 2% four times a day, epinephrine 2% twice a day, carbachol 1.5% four times a day, or 250 mg of acetazolamide twice a day to 44 patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma. Compared to baseline readings on standard therapy alone, mean intraocular pressure was significantly reduced after addition of timolol maleate to each of the regimens. Mean facility of outflow was unaffected. No clinically significant ocular irritation or changes in visual acuity, pupil size, or vital signs were observed in any patient. Timolol maleate appears to be effective and well tolerated when administered with other antiglaucoma medications in patients with open-angle glaucoma.", 
    "38": "Labetalol has a unique and profound effect on the IOP of rabbits, in contrast to pure beta-adrenergic blockers which have little or no effect in this animal. Its action cannot be satisfactorily explained by simple alpha and beta-adrenergic blocking activity. In the concentrations used, it failed to block the action of a beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol), the action of an alpha-adrenegic agonist (norepinephrine), and its own hypotensive action was neither blocked nor potentiated by the alpha-adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine. However, the beta blocker, timolol, did reduce the action of labetalol. These observations and the reduced response to labetalol after cervical sympathectomy, suggest that labetalol's ocular hypotensive effect may occur through some mechanism other than alpha or beta blockade.", 
    "39": "When extracerebral dopa decarboxylase is inhibited by carbidopa, L-dopa lowers plasma renin activity (PRA). The present study was designed to determine whether this suppression of PRA is mediated by the sympathetic nerves, and to identify the peripheral adrenergic receptor types involved. All experiments were performed in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs in which changes in renal perfusion pressure were minimized by means of a suprarenal aortic clamp. Neither alpha adrenoreceptor blockage with phenoxybenzamine nor beta adrenoreceptor blockade with propranolol was by itself sufficient to block the suppression of PRA by L-dopa with carbidopa. However, combined alpha and beta adrenoreceptor blockade lowered PRA and completely prevented any further suppression of PRA by L-dopa with carbidopa. It was also observed that phenoxybenzamine decreased PRA by 48% when administered to propranolol-treated animals. Taken together, these data indicate that L-dopa with carbidopa suppresses PRA by decreasing sympathetic nerve stimulation of both alpha and beta adrenoreceptors. Plasma vasopressin concnetration was significantly decreased by L-dopa with carbidopa both in the control group and in animals with combined alpha and beta adrenoreceptor blockade. Because plasma vasopressin levels decreased after L-dopa, vasopressin is unlikely to play a causative role in the suppression of PRA.", 
    "40": "Unlike asthmatics, healthy persons are relatively unresponsive to airway constrictors. By using partial expiratory flow-volume (PEFV) curves the authors have demontrated, in healthy subjects, dose-related decreases in flow rates following challenge with histamine and methacholine aerosols. With the use of semilogarithmic dose-response curves they have shown that 80 mg oral propranolol augmented, whereas oral pretreatment with 400 mg W10294A (an experimental bronchodilator) decreased, histamine and methacholine-induced airway constriction. However, 300 mg of orally administered aminophylline failed to modify the airway constrictor effects of histamine and methacholine. Moreover, variation was noted in induced airway constriction in healthy subjects with decreases in flow rates being greater in the morning than in the afternoon. The authors conclude that (1) propranolol augments whereas theophylline fails to prevent nonspecific induced airway constriction in healthy subjects. This suggests that the bronchodilator action of theophylline may be unrelated to its phosphodiesterase inhibitory activity, (2) control of volume history, by use of partial expiratory flow-volume curves, is useful in quantifying pharmacologic protection and augmentation of nonspecific induced airway constriction in healthy subjects and (3) conclusions resulting from observations of induced airway constriction in healthy subjects may be dependent upon the effects of diurnal variation.", 
    "41": "We introduce a frequency normalized, power averaged, rate of generation of power density (FARPD) that extends the range of applicability of the averaged rate of generation of power density (ARPD) to any cardiac frequency encountered in experimental or clinical situations. Normalization eliminates the frequency-dependent mathematical artifacts arising during the computation of quantities containing time derivatives of the pressure, while preserving the effects of changes in heart rate on the cardiac muscle itself (Bowditch type of phenomena). The distribution of normal values in a group of 51 control dogs was very close to the standard normal distribution. These values had no statistically significant differences with those of a smaller control group studied by independent investigators. Isoproterenol and propranolol produced highly significant statistical changes in FARPD. Alterations in pre- and afterload produced changes that were not significant for the former and significant at the 5% level for the latter. These changes were small when compared to those resulting from typical inotropic interventions.", 
    "42": "The cardiac lymphatic duct was cannulated in dogs and the exteriorized cannula allowed chronic collection of lymph during the awake state for as long as 3 wk. The surgical methodology and inherent difficulties in the technique are describ:d. Cardiac lymph flow ranged from 0.45--5.6 ml/h in the control state in 14 dogs. An occluding device and flow probe were placed on the circumflex coronary artery (CFX); ultrasonic segment length crystals were placed in the left ventricular free wall in 4 dogs. Occlusion of the CFX in these conscious dogs caused lymph flow to fall as great as 46% below control during the 1st half-hour. Reperfusion of the occluded vessel caused an increase in lymph flow as great as 67% above control. The effect on cardiac lymph flow was demonstrated for a few select drugs that have known effects on the cardiovascular system. Cardiac lymph flow was altered from control as follows: isoproterenol, 42 +/- 11% increase; RO 2-2985, 118 +/- 8% increase; verapamil, 101 +/- 10% increase; propranolol caused no significant change. The conscious dog with cardiac lymph vessel cannulated should provide a model to further study the complexities of cardiac metabolism and physiology without interference of anesthesia and surgical stress.", 
    "43": "One hundred ninety-one children were tested by one of three screening procedures for growth hormone deficiency over a five-year period. Sleep screen yielded a 31.3% false-positive rate; levodopa administration alone yielded a 20.5% false-positive rate and levodopa in combination with propranolol yielded a 5.2% false-positive rate. These results support the view that the combined levodopa-propranolol hydrochloride screen test is superior to either the sleep or the levodopa screen tests in limiting the number of false-positive results and thus the need for further, more extensive testing.", 
    "44": "Arterial compliance and indexes of ventricular ejection were measured in 27 men with systolic hypertension. The patients were separated into two age groups, younger or older than age 35 years, and matched with normotensive control subjects. Arterial compliance was estimated from analysis of the monoexponential blood pressure-time curve during diastole, according to a simple viscoelastic model. In the younger patients, arterial compliance and stroke volume were within normal ranges. Rapid ejection time was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001), indicating an increased venlocity in the first part of ventricular ejection. Systolic pressure decreased significantly after administration of propranolol, which also caused prolongation of rapid ejection time. In the older patients, indexes of ventricular ejection were within normal limits. arterial compliance was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) and was negatively correlated with the level of systolic pressure (P less than 0.001). Systolic pressure decreased significantly after administration of sodium nitroprusside, which caused an increase in arterial compliance. These findings provide evidence that: (1) the hemodynamic mechanisms of systolic hypertension differ in younger and older patients, and (2) these hemodynamic differences should be taken into account when choosing drugs to decrease systolic pressure.", 
    "45": "The hemodynamic effects of intravenous timolol were evaluated in 20 patients with coronary artery disease during diagnostic cardiac catheterization. The threshold dose of 0.25 mg reduced heart rate and cardiac index by 15% (p less than 0.05), left ventricular work index by 21% (p less than 0.05), and left ventricular dp/dt by 16% (p less than 0.05) while increasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure by 49% (p less than 0.01), mean pulmonary arterial pressure by 17% (p less than 0.01), and systemic vascular resistance by 16% (NS). Larger doses (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) induced similar responses with a greater effect on systemic vascular resistance (+22%, p less than 0.01, and +31%, p less than 0.001). The mean arterial pressure and stroke volumes were not affected by timolol. Peak effects, occurring at about 10 min after drug injection, did not correlate with plasma levels. The overall hemodynamic effects of timolol were similar to those reported for equipotent doses of propranolol and could be accounted for by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity.", 
    "46": "Induction of microsomal enzymes with barbiturates in rats has little effect on the metabolism of metoprolol, compared with propranolol and alprenolol, which undergo extensive hepatic extraction in animals and man. Our study was designed to examine whether the metabolism of metoprolol is inducable by barbiturate in man. In 8 healthy subjects the area under the plasma concentration/time curve after 0.1 gm metoprolol was reduced by a mean of 32% after treatment with 0.1 gm pentobarbital at bedtime for 10 days. There was considerable interindividual variability in the reduction after pentobarbital treatment (2% to 46%).", 
    "47": "The hypotensive effect of 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg and 0 mg of atenolol daily were compared in a double-blind within-patient study. The fall in blood pressure with 25 mg daily was not significantly different than with 100 mg. The dose response curve lies between 0 and 25 mg daily. Cardiac beta-blockade (measured by suppression of exercise tachycardia) was not maximal with 25 mg of atenolol daily. The dose response curves for beta-blockade and the hypotensive effect are not parallel.", 
    "48": "Twenty-four-hour electrocardiographic tape-recording was used to investigate the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with suspected myocardial infarction who were receiving either propranolol, atenolol, or placebo. Recordings begun within 24 hours after admission to a coronary care unit showed that 76% of patients eventually found to have had a myocardial infarction had ventricular arrhythmias of a type generally regarded as serious, whereas of patients in whom myocardial infarction was not substantiated, only 24% had such arrhythmias. At one and six weeks after admission the incidence of arrhythmias ranged from 25% to 33% irrespective of diagnosis. Of patients monitored at both one and six weeks, however, only 5% had arrhythmias on each occasion. Patients treated with propranolol and atenolol showed a similar incidence of arrhythmias to those taking placebo. There was no difference in the incidence or type of arrhythmias recorded between patients who died and those who were still alive at six weeks.These results confirm that \"serious\" ventricular arrythmias occur in most patients during the acute phase of myocardial infarction and suggest that they do not constitute an independent risk factor. Beta-blockers showed little evidence of useful antiarrhythmic action in the dosage used, but increasing the dosage in suspected myocardial infarction is not practicable because of the risk of hypotension. The findings raise grave doubts about the value of studying arrhythmias to assess drugs intended to reduce mortality from myocardial infarction.", 
    "49": "Pharmacokinetic methods that have been used to improve antihypertensive drug therapy, including antihypertensive dosage regimens, are reviewed. Pharmacokinetic variables have been determined that allow: (1) derivation of the loading dose necessary to achieve rapid control of blood pressure with propranolol hydrochloride, guanethidine, minoxidil and clonidine hydrochloride; (2) reduced frequency of dosing with methyldopa, hydralazine hydrochloride, prazosin hydrochloride, propranolol and clonidine; and (3) alteration of propranolol and hydralazine dosage based on physiologic factors (e.g., renal and hepatic impairment, binding to plasma proteins, altered enzyme activity). More rapid control of hypertension is possible, patient compliance is enhanced and drug toxicity is reduced by applying pharmacokinetic principles to develop individualized antihypertensive dosage regimens.", 
    "50": "To evaluate the antiarrhythmic efficacy of the new beta adrenergic blocking agent acebutolol, 15 monitored patients with supraventricular arrhythmias received, in double-blind fashion, an intravenous infusion of either acebutolol or saline solution after a control period. Patients treated with saline solution demonstrated no change (P greater than 0.05) in heart rate or arterial blood pressure or conversion to sinus rhythm. After administration of acebutolol, significant (P less than 0.05) reductions in heart rate were noted at 5 minutes. Peak reduction occurred at 10 to 30 minutes and correlated with maximal acebutolol plasma concentrations, antiarrhythmic activity persisted for 24 hours. Mild reductions in systolic blood pressure were observed in the majority of patients. Two patients with atrial fibrillation and one with multifocal atrial tachycardia had conversion to sinus rhythm. Frequent premature atrial complexes noted in one patient were greatly suppressed after administration of the drug. In the nine patients with clinical evidence of chronic obstructive lung disease acebutolol was well tolerated. Adverse reactions were limited to transient dyspnea in one patient with prior heart failure and a decrease in systolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg in three patients who remained asymptomatic. In the patients studied, acebutolol was an effective agent for the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias and appeared to be of special value in those with chronic obstructive lung disease.", 
    "51": "Timolol, 10 to 40 mg daily, given to 103 patients with uncomplicated arterial hypertension induced significant increments of serum potassium at all dose levels (p less than 0.05). The magnitude of the increments was dependent on daily timolol dosage. When hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride were added, serum potassium decreased (p less than 0.001), but a major determinant of the magnitude of the decrease was the dosage change of the timolol. Serum uric acid was influenced in a paradoxical way during timolol monotherapy; there was a rise in all 3 dosage groups (p less than 0.02) but the lowest group showed the largest increase and vice versa. On addition of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride, there was a further increase in serum uric acid, the magnitude of which depended on the concomitant reduction in the dose of timolol, with reductions in dose causing a larger rise in serum uric acid and increments, a smaller rise. The increments of serum uric acid were greater in females than in males during both treatment periods. The results indicate that beta blockers induce dose-dependent rises in serum potassium and may counteract undesirable effects of diuretics on serum potassium. Beta blockers seem to have a paradoxical effect on serum uric acid and may aggravate the hyperuricemia induced by diuretics.", 
    "52": "Unanesthetized bullfrogs were involuntarily submerged for 25 min in air-saturated water at 21 degrees C. Significant bradycardia was observed while systemic blood pressure was maintained or slightly elevated. Upon emergence, heart rates immediately returned to presubmergence levels or higher. Similar responses were observed in frogs allowed to make voluntary dives in an experimental tank. Heart rates of vagal-blocked (atropine) frogs did not change during submergence or emergence. beta-Adrenergic blockade (propranolol) had little effect on the magnitude of heart rate decrease during submergence or its increase upon emergence. After alpha-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine), frogs developed diving bradycardia while undergoing a fall in systemic blood pressure. It is concluded that, in bullfrogs, 1) bradycardia during submergence is entirely due to increased vagal activity, 2) the immediate cardiac rate increase upon emergence apparently results from a decrease in vagal tone; and 3) there appears to be no substantial reciprocal sympathetic influence on heart rate during alterations in vagal tone.", 
    "53": "Fluid secretion from the cannulated excretory duct of the rabbit lacrimal gland was collected in microcapillary pipette at 10 min intervals. Secretion rate and electrolyte concentrations (Na+, K+ and Cl-) in the lacrimal fluid samples were determined before and after injections of small doses of prostaglandins (PGE1, PGE2, PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, 15 epi-PGF2 alpha, PGF2 beta, PGA1 & PGA2) into the external maxillary artery. Only PGE1 had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on the lacrimal gland secretion. The maximum secretion rate which was induced by PGE1 (25 micrograms/kg) was 7.2 +/- 0.9 microliters/10 min. Na+ concentration in the fluid secretion stimulated by PGE1 was increased; however, K+ and Cl- concentrations were not changed. Pretreatment with atropine (50 micrograms/kg, I.A.) failed to prevent the stimulatory effect of low doses of PGE1. On the other hand, the secretory responses were abolished when propanolol (3 mg/kg, I.A.) was administered prior to PGE1. The results suggest that fluid secretion of the rabbit lacrimal gland in response to PGE1 may be caused by excitation of the sympathetic ganglia and/or by direct action on beta-receptors in the acinar cells."
