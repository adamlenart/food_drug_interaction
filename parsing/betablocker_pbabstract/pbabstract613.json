    "0": "Spontaneously hypertensive (SH), Wistar Kyoto (WKY) or Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were tested for their responsiveness to noxious mechanical pressure before and after a subplantar yeast injection to the right rear paw. Prior to the yeast injection, hypertensive animals were less responsive to pain relative to normotensive animals, as seen in the significantly greater pre-yeast latencies of SH compared to WKY or SD rats. Subplantar yeast injection produced hyperreactivity in the inflamed paws of WKY or SD rats, with no effect on the contralateral non-injected paw. However, identical subplantar yeast injections to hypertensive animals produced a robust, long-lasting antinociceptive effect in both rear paws of SH rats. This effect was not reversed by naloxone (opiate antagonist), labetalol (beta-blocker/vasodilator antihypertensive), or hydralazine (peripheral vasodilator antihypertensive); the antinociception was not potentiated by thiorphan (enkephalinase inhibitor). However, the alpha 2-receptor antagonist yohimbine (0.1-5 mg/kg s.c.), produced a dose-related reversal of the yeast-induced antinociception in SH rats. These results suggest that the subplantar yeast injection is triggering descending noradrenergic pain inhibitory pathways in SH rats.", 
    "1": "Stimulation of the preganglionic trunk of the ipsilateral superior cervical sympathetic ganglion with square wave electrical pulses produced secretion from the main excretory duct of the rabbit lacrimal gland. The secretion was inhibited by propranolol (1 mg/kg) and metoprolol (10 mg/kg) but not by phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg) and atropine (25 micrograms/kg). The results indicate that the sympathetically induced secretion in the rabbit lacrimal gland occurs through an adrenergic mechanism. The adrenergic receptors in the lacrimal gland is most likely of beta 1-type.", 
    "2": "The postnatal development of skeletal muscle is accompanied by an increased capacity for glycogenolysis and anaerobic glycolysis. In the present study, regulatory features of cAMP synthesis were examined in neonatal and adult rabbit sarcolemmal membranes. Adult sarcolemma exhibited a 3-, 6-, and 10-fold greater adenylate cyclase activity than neonate for basal, NaF, and isoproterenol plus GTP, respectively. The Km for activation by isoproterenol was 1.4 X 10(-8) M and 6 X 10(-8) M for GTP. The number of beta-receptors was similar (0.9-1.2 pmol/mg). 10 microM GTP shifted isoproterenol EC50 from 1 X 10(-8) M to 1 X 10(-7) M in adult; neonatal agonist affinity was unaffected by GTP. Cholera toxin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity 2-fold and catalyzed 32P ribosylation of a Mr = 42,000 peptide in adult sarcolemma; both activities were low or absent in neonate. Isoproterenol-stimulated GTPase activity was elevated 4-fold in adult compared to neonatal sarcolemma. Mn2+ ion-stimulated basal activity, an indicator of catalytic function of adenylate cyclase, was also elevated in adult. Together, these findings suggest that the development of catecholamine-sensitive cAMP synthesis in muscle is governed by the coordinate expression of the regulatory and catalytic proteins of adenylate cyclase, but not the beta-receptor.", 
    "3": "Fifty patients (25 Blacks and 25 Indians) suffering from mild-to-moderate hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure 100 - 105 mmHg) were studied in order to compare the antihypertensive effect of a combination of a beta-blocker (sotalol hydrochloride 160 mg/d) plus a thiazide derivative (hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/d) ( Sotazide ; B-M) with that of a combination of reserpine 0,1 mg/d ( Serpasil ; Ciba) plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/d ( Dichlotride ; Frosst MSD). The combination of reserpine plus hydrochlorothiazide was found to be as effective as that of sotalol plus hydrochlorothiazide in lowering the blood pressure in both the Black and the Indian patients. Two patients taking the combination containing reserpine developed side-effects, but this did not occur in any of those taking the combination containing sotalol. We feel that in developing countries, where the cost of therapy is important, reserpine in a dosage of less than 0,1 mg/d plus a thiazide derivative in low dosage is preferable to a beta-blocker plus a thiazide derivative in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "4": "Bacterial endotoxin (E. coli O111:B4) induces, 4 days after intraperitoneal injection, a 30% reduction of guinea pig lung beta-adrenoceptor number (Bmax). No change in affinity (Kd) for the receptors occurred. Bilateral electrolytic lesions centered in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus prevent this reduction in Bmax and even reverse the reduction into a small increase in beta-adrenoceptor number. Since it is known from the literature data that anterior hypothalamic lesions as well as beta-adrenoceptor stimulants have an inhibitory influence on the immune system, the mechanism by which these lesions inhibit the reduction of beta-adrenoceptor sites after bacterial endotoxin and influence immune functions, may be related.", 
    "5": "Rat hearts were perfused for long periods in the presence of 14C-labeled amino acids. From these hearts, postheparin-effluent and a tissue homogenate containing lipoprotein lipase and neutral lipase, respectively, were derived. Lipolytic activity and 14C-labeled protein in both preparations were characterized by affinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lipase activity and 14C-labeled protein co-eluted from heparin-Sepharose 4B at 1.2 M NaCl and were inhibited and precipitated by preincubation with anti-lipoprotein lipase gamma-globulins. Gel electrophoresis of both preparations showed the presence of 14C-labeled protein with a molecular weight of 35 000. These data strongly suggest similarity between lipoprotein lipase and neutral lipase and their possible precursor-product relationship and indicate that during perfusion continuous synthesis, secretion and vascular binding of lipase molecules occur. Cycloheximide perfusion induced a dramatic decrease of lipoprotein lipase and neutral lipase activity, indicating a half-life of less than 90 min for both enzymes. Tunicamycin present during perfusion also induced a drop in lipoprotein lipase and tissue neutral lipase activity, indicating that glycosylation is necessary for secretion of lipoprotein lipase. Long-term perfusion of rat hearts in the presence of norepinephrine, glucagon or tyrosine leads to reciprocal alterations in lipoprotein lipase and neutral lipase activities, i.e., lipoprotein lipase activity increased and neutral lipase activity decreased, whereas total lipase activity (lipoprotein lipase + neutral lipase) remained unaltered. During perfusion in the presence of insulin, no net change in lipase activities was observed. Also, insulin did not affect the glucagon-induced inverse effects on either lipase activity. The reciprocal changes in lipase activities occurring during norepinephrine perfusion were hampered by colchicine and propranolol, pointing towards beta-receptor and microtubular mediation of tissue lipase processing and endothelial binding. Our data suggest that the tissue flux and vascular binding of lipase protein may be important sites of hormonal regulation of lipoprotein lipase homeostasis.", 
    "6": "Photoaffinity labeling of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata electric tissue was performed in the presence of cholinergic effectors in the millisecond to second time range by a combination of a stopped-flow apparatus and a high-energy pulse laser. The label applied was [3H]triphenylmethylphosphonium, a lipophilic cation previously shown to be a specific blocker of the acetylcholine receptor ion channel. With the receptor in the resting state most of the label was incorporated into the alpha polypeptide chains. In the presence of agonists and antagonists increasing incorporation into the delta- and (less pronounced) the beta-chain was observed. The time course of this increase had a half-life of about 0.4 s, being slower than receptor activation and channel opening. in the resting, active, and even rapidly desensitized state, the alpha polypeptide chains appear to be the primary targets of the photoaffinity reaction. The action spectrum of the photolabeling has a sharp maximum at lambda = 270 nm and a small-side maximum at lambda = 290 nm. It does not resemble the absorption spectrum of the label and may hint at amino acid side chains as the moieties activated by UV light causing the photolabeling. The effector specificity of the observed slow increase of label incorporation into the delta polypeptide chain was investigated. It does not prove that slow desensitization is the underlying event. The agonists acetylcholine and carbamoylcholine as well as treatment of receptor-rich membranes with phospholipase A2 (but not phospholipase D) triggered labeling of delta, but antagonists such as D-tubocurarine and most conspicuously flaxedil had a similar effect.", 
    "7": "The pretreatment of rat cerebral cortical membranes with 10 or 100 microM isoproterenol at 37 degrees C for 40 min caused a significant elevation of the Bmax value of [3H]clonidine binding but pretreatment at 4 degrees C did not affect the value. The isoproterenol-induced increase in the Bmax value of the binding was higher in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7) than in Krebs-Ringer solution. In 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7), treatment with isoproterenol reduced the Bmax value of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding but neither Kd nor Bmax of [3H]WB 4101 binding was affected by this treatment. Fifty microM propranolol or 100 microM GTP produced a significant reduction in isoproterenol-induced elevation of the Bmax value of [3H]clonidine binding. In contrast, 100 microM cyclic AMP did not affect the control binding and 0.1 or 1 mM theophylline did not affect the isoproterenol-induced elevation of the binding. The only Bmax value in high affinity binding of [3H]clonidine was increased by isoproterenol. It is suggested that isoproterenol increases the density of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in a temperature-dependent manner. The direct interaction between beta- and alpha 2-receptor molecules and/or their indirect interaction, mediated by GTP regulatory proteins, would exist in the cerebral cortical membranes of rats.", 
    "8": "Using the blind method, a group of 91 coronary heart disease patients were studied. A two-week course of obsidan therapy proved to be most effective in patients with two impaired vessels and also in patients with a simultaneous decrease in the heart rate and in the systolic blood pressure during the threshold exercise. A parallel increase in the stroke index during exercise and a decrease in the myocardial contractile function at rest (by echocardiographic findings) suggest that the decrease in the systolic arterial pressure is associated with a negative inotropic effect of the drug. A decrease in the heart rate and myocardial contractility was observed only in patients with initial tachycardia and the intact functional state of the cardiac muscle. The best antianginal response occurs when these effects are combined.", 
    "9": "The effect of pretreatment with multiple doses of 100 mg of metoprolol on the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine has been studied in six young healthy subjects. The lidocaine dose was 100 mg and the infusion time 12 minutes. Metoprolol had no effect on the levels or the time course of lidocaine in the plasma. The disposition characteristics of the antiarrhythmic agent were not significantly altered by metoprolol in these individuals. These results cannot be extrapolated to prolonged infusion of lidocaine in patients with myocardial infarction.", 
    "10": "Electrophysiologic studies were performed in 10 normals and 33 patients with sick sinus syndrome before and after total autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine. In normals both corrected sinus node recovery time (SNRT) and sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) decreased significantly after autonomic blockade. In patients with sick sinus syndrome the corrected SNRT was abnormal (greater than 450 msec) in 16 (48.5%) cases before and 25 (76%) cases (greater than 285 msec) after autonomic ablation (P less than 0.02). Thirteen of 21 patients (62%) with normal intrinsic heart rate and all 12 cases with abnormally low intrinsic rate after autonomic blockade had abnormal corrected SNRT (greater than 285 msec). Mean SACT measured in 19 patients also shortened significantly following pharmacologic denervation. During control it was prolonged (greater than 226 msec) in 8 patients (44%). After autonomic blockade 2 of 13 patients with normal intrinsic heart rate and 3 of 6 with low intrinsic rate showed abnormal SACT (greater than 151 msec). The data suggest that the majority (76%) of patients with sick sinus syndrome have intrinsic abnormality of sinus node automaticity while in a minority (24%) disturbed autonomic regulation is the pathogenetic mechanism. Patients with normal intrinsic heart rate usually have normal intrinsic SACT, while a significant proportion of those with low intrinsic rate have abnormal perinodal conduction. Subjects with abnormal intrinsic heart rate have more severe disturbances of sinus node function than those with normal intrinsic rate.", 
    "11": "Nadolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, and bendroflumethiazide, a thiazide diuretic, were administered orally alone and in combination to animals in acute and 6-month toxicity studies and in a rat teratology study. The two drugs in combination showed no evidence of potentiation of acute toxicity in mice. Nadolol and/or bendroflumethiazide were administered orally to rats at daily doses of 1000 or 160 mg/kg of nadolol and 125 or 20 mg/kg of bendroflumethiazide and to dogs at daily doses of 160 or 40 mg/kg of nadolol and 20 or 5 mg/kg of bendroflumethiazide for 6 months. The two drugs, alone and in combination, caused only minor changes in clinical-laboratory tests and no major gross or histopathologic changes. Many of the changes noted were expected pharmacologic effects of the individual agents. The drugs, alone or in combination, produced no evidence of embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, or teratogenicity in rats. The results of these studies indicate that nadolol and bendroflumethiazide have a low order of toxicity individually, and when given in combination show no additional or potentiated toxicity.", 
    "12": "A multicenter randomized clinical trial can offer exciting and challenging opportunities to the clinical coordinators and other health professionals who participate in the conduct of a clinical trial at the clinical units. This article will address an acute intervention trial, the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size, and demonstrate some of the important responsibilities of the clinical unit research nurse coordinators in the conduct and operation of this trial.", 
    "13": "The effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent timolol on cardiac function and adenine nucleotide metabolism were investigated in cats with 45 min of acute ischaemia following coronary occlusion. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured by 15 micron radiolabelled microspheres, and adenine nucleotides and their degradation products were measured by high performance liquid chromatography in 16 tissue regions in each cat. During ischaemia, cats treated with timolol exerted a reduced cardiac performance as judged from reduced heart rate and cardiac contractility; consequently preocclusion tissue blood flow was reduced compared with a control group of cats. The ATP concentration was less severely depleted in ischaemic regions of the left ventricle in cats treated with timolol. The energy charge was reduced to a lesser extent in ischaemic regions, and in intermediate flow ranges the contents of the inosine and hypoxanthine/xanthine were reduced compared with untreated cats. These results indicate that the beta-adrenergic blocking agent timolol might protect the myocardium within a 45 min ischaemic period. The mechanism for this effect is most probably related to the reduction in overall cardiac performance.", 
    "14": "Sperm immobilizing activity of three class I antiarrhythmic drugs, quinidine, procainamide, mexiletine, one adrenoceptor blocking drug, labetalol and one calcium channel blocking drug, diltiazem was measured with a trans-membrane migration method. All these drugs immobilized human sperm. Local anaesthetic effect is the underlying mechanism for these drugs to inhibit sperm motility. Sperm immobilization could be a screening test for the local anaesthetic effect of antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "15": "Sperm immobilizing activity of 3 class 1 antiarrhythmic drugs, quinidine, procainamide, mexiletine, 1 adrenoceptor blocking drug, labetalol, and 1 calcium channel blocking drug, diltiazem was measured with a trans-membrane migration method. Fresh human semen samples were collected from healthy donors. At least 4 samples were tested for each drug. All semen samples fulfilled previous criteria for trans-membrane migration studies. The trans-membrane migration method evaluated human sperm motility be measuring the proportion of sperm that moved across a Nuclepore membrane during 2 hours incubation at 37 degrees Centigrade. The concentration of drug that decreased sperm motility to 50% of control (EC50) was obtained from the concentration resonse curve. A paired t-test was used to compare the differences between the potencies of diltiazem in phosphate buffered saline and in 5% ethanol. The concentrations that decreased sperm motility to 50% of control (EC50) were 0.5, 1.2, 1.4, 2.2, 2.8, and 20 mm for quinidine, diltiazem in 5% ethanol, diltiazem in phosphate buffered saline, labetalol, mexiletine, and procainamide respecitvely. The differences between the sperm immobilizing potencies of diltiazem in 5% ethanol and in phosphate buffered saline were not statistically significant at any concentration.", 
    "16": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol (80 mg by mouth) were studied in seven extensive and four poor metabolisers of debrisoquine. Evidence for impairment of the 4'-hydroxylation of propranolol was found in poor metabolisers. However, no significant difference was detected in the oral clearance of unchanged drug between the two groups of debrisoquine oxidation phenotypes. Poor metabolisers of debrisoquine did not experience more intense or more prolonged beta-adrenoceptor blockade than extensive metabolisers of debrisoquine.", 
    "17": "The degree of parasympathetic control of heart rate was assessed by the abolition of respiratory sinus arrhythmia with atropine. Peak-to-peak variations in heart periods (VHP) before atropine injection correlated significantly (r = 0.90, P less than 0.001) with parasympathetic control, indicating that VHP alone may be used as a noninvasive indicator of the parasympathetic control of heart rate. Pharmacologic blockade of beta-adrenergic supply in a separate group of normal volunteers did not alter the relationship between VHP and parasympathetic control, indicating that the condition of the experiment (complete rest in a quiet atmosphere) allows the use of VHP alone without pharmacologic interventions to characterize the vagal control of heart rate in humans.", 
    "18": "Rats anesthetized with pentobarbital and ventilated artificially were intoxicated with 1 mg/kg X min propranolol i.v. After 30 min heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure and peripheral resistance had dropped by about 50% and cardiac output by about 25% and were stable for up to 120 min. Isoprenaline proved to be the best antidote for the treatment of propranolol intoxication antagonizing the bradycardia by 76% and the hypotension completely. The antagonistic activities of orciprenaline and prenalterol were lower than those of isoprenaline. Dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline antagonized propranolol-induced hypotension but did not considerably influence the bradycardia whereas dobutamine was nearly ineffective in both respects. Glucagon and aminophylline displayed some chronotropic activity without influencing propranolol-induced hypotension. Calcium chloride, on the other hand, produced a moderate elevation of blood pressure but only a small chronotropic activity, and atropine was inactive in both respects. Isoprenaline also restored the cardiac function of propranolol-poisoned rats if administered by infusion and, furthermore, increased the lethal dose of propranolol from 77 to 165 mg/kg. The strong antagonistic activity of isoprenaline against propranolol-induced cardiovascular depression was also confirmed by experiments in pigs. In conclusion, isoprenaline is the most active antidote for the treatment of propranolol intoxication in the rat though the administration of massive doses are required. The vasodilatory effect of isoprenaline can be overcome by the additional administration of a vasoconstricting agent like dopamine.", 
    "19": "A possible interaction of central histaminergic receptors with adrenergic and cholinergic muscarinic neurons in increasing the pituitary-adrenocortical response under stress, assessed indirectly from the corticosterone concentration in blood serum, was investigated in conscious rats. All the drugs were administered intracerebroventriculary, the antagonists 15 to 30 min prior to the agonists. The histamine-induced increase in serum corticosterone levels of stressed rats was considerably antagonized by prazosin, phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and yohimbine, alpha 1 and alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists. These antagonists abolished or significantly attenuated the corticosterone response to 2-pyridylethylamine (PEA), an H1-receptor agonist, and to dimaprit and 4-methylhistamine(4-MeHA), H2-receptor agonists. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, did not substantially change the corticosterone response induced by histamine or histamine H1- and H2-receptor agonists. Similarly, atropine was ineffective in blocking the increase in serum corticosterone responses induced by either histamine or PEA and dimaprit in stressed rats. These results suggest that both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, but not beta-adrenergic and cholinergic muscarinic receptors interact with central H1 and H2 histaminergic stimulation of the increased pituitary-adrenocortical response in stressed rats.", 
    "20": "A simple method for screening drugs that influence tracheobronchial secretion has been described. After i.p. application of a phenol red solution, part of the dye is secreted into the tracheal lumen. This basal secretion is increased by both parasympathomimetics and sympathomimetics. In addition, expectorants are also capable of increasing tracheal phenol red output. Therefore this method is suitable for the study of drugs that may be capable of influencing tracheobronchial secretion.", 
    "21": "A system was developed which is capable of monitoring the dissolution profiles of each of the active components in a two-component combination product. The UV spectra of the two drugs (metoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide) overlap considerably, making conventional UV analysis of either component unrealistic. By resolving the two drugs on a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) system both can be quantitated after separation. The analysis is sufficiently short to allow for the use of a six-station dissolution tester in tandem with an HPLC for determination of dissolution profiles. The HPLC system and equipment, can monitor six samples of this product at 5-min intervals in real analysis time.", 
    "22": "A neuropharmacologic approach was utilized to investigate the catecholaminergic influence on the hypothalamic regulation of growth hormone (GH) secretion in young (6-week-old) male domestic fowl. The selective inhibition of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) synthesis or activity by diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), FLA63 (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitors), phenoxybenzamine (alpha 1 receptor blocker), and yohimbine (alpha 1 and alpha 2 receptor antagonist) was associated with a decline in circulating GH levels. Similarly inhibition of NE reuptake by imipramine or desmethylimipramine were followed by reduced GH secretion. In the presence of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha Mpt, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor), the administration of phenylephrine (alpha 1 agonist) was followed by increased plasma concentrations of GH. However, alone, it was without effect. Similarly plasma concentrations of GH were elevated by dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS, a precursor of NE/E) in chicks pretreated with DDC or carbidopa. These data are consistent with the stimulatory hypothalamic control of GH involving NE/E which exert their effects via alpha (probably alpha 1) postsynaptic stimulatory receptors. Evidence that it is E rather than NE, which is the catecholamine involved or the hypothalamic control of GH, comes from the decrease in plasma GH concentration following the inhibition of central E synthesis by SKF64139 (an inhibitor of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase). Some evidence for a limited inhibitory dopaminergic system was found. Inhibition of dopamine (DA) synthesis by alpha Mpt produced significant elevations in plasma GH concentration. In addition, apomorphine (DA agonist) consistently depressed GH release. However, blockade of DA receptors by pimozide had either no effect on plasma GH concentrations or at a very high dose decreased plasma GH concentrations. NE/E also appear to have a depressive effect on plasma concentrations of GH in young chicks, probably via a peripheral site of action. Plasma concentrations of GH were reduced by the peripheral administration of NE, which might be expected not to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), alpha 1/alpha 2 agonists clonidine and p-amino clonidine (which does not cross BBB), NE/E precursors L-DOPA and DOPS, and the beta agonist, isoproterenol. Furthermore, the depression of peripheral E synthesis (by SKF29661 which inhibits phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase) elevated the plasma concentration of GH.", 
    "23": "Our objective was to determine the kinetics of (+)- and (-)-propranolol after intravenous doses of racemic drug. Five normal subjects received 0.1 mg/kg of a pseudoracemate of propranolol that consisted of deuterium-labeled (+)-propranolol and unlabeled (-)-propranolol. Plasma concentrations of (+)- and (-)-propranolol as measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated enantiomeric differences in systemic clearance (Cls) [(+)-propranolol, 1.21 +/- 0.15 l/min; (-)-propranolol, 1.03 +/- 0.12 l/min; P less than 0.01] and apparent volume of distribution (Vd) [(+)-propranolol, 4.82 +/- 0.34 l/kg; (-)-propranolol, 4.08 +/- 0.33 l/kg; P less than 0.001], but no difference in distribution or elimination t1/2s (t1/2 beta 3.5 hr). The higher Cls of (+)-propranolol suggests stereoselective hepatic elimination. The higher apparent Vd of (+)-propranolol is mainly related to its lower plasma binding [(+)-propranolol, 20.3 +/- 0.8% unbound; (-)-propranolol, 17.6 +/- 0.7% unbound; P less than 0.001]. There was no stereoselective uptake by red blood cells. These findings demonstrate that multiple stereoselective mechanisms are involved in the disposition of propranolol and determine the access of the drug to active sites.", 
    "24": "The effects of beta adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol or pindolol on serum total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and its subfractions HDL2 and HDL3, serum triglyceride, and Intralipid clearance were studied in 17 normolipidaemic, non-diabetic patients with hypertension or angina pectoris. Both pindolol and propranolol had similar effects on fasting serum total and lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. HDL2 cholesterol concentrations were reduced by 9 +/- 29% and HDL3 cholesterol increased by 11 +/- 16%, but there were no significant changes in total or LDL cholesterol in the combined groups after six weeks' treatment. After 12 weeks' treatment total cholesterol concentrations were reduced by 7 +/- 10% mainly owing to a reduction in the LDL fraction of 9 +/- 15%. Concentrations of HDL2 remained low, 8% less than control values. Serum triglyceride concentrations were increased by both drugs at six weeks but had returned to base values in the pindolol group by the twelfth week. Pindolol, but not propranolol, enhanced the rate of clearance of intravenous Intralipid.", 
    "25": "Systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of prenalterol, a beta-1 receptor agonist, were determined in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, initially after intravenous administration (10 patients) and then after oral administration (eight patients). Cardiac index increased by 33 percent and 30 percent after intravenous and oral prenalterol, respectively. The increase in stroke volume index and stroke work index and decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance were not significant. Myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary sinus blood flow increased in the majority of patients, although these changes were not statistically significant. There were no significant changes in transmyocardial norepinephrine or epinephrine balance. The systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of both intravenous and oral prenalterol were similar. Major side effects included sudden death (two patients) and hypotension and bradycardia (three patients) during oral prenalterol treatment. It is concluded that improved left ventricular function following both intravenous and oral prenalterol may be associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption, and serious adverse effects may occur during prenalterol therapy.", 
    "26": "Fifty-nine normal patients (34 angiographically normal and 25 clinically normal by Bayesian analysis) underwent thallium-201 imaging after maximal upright exercise. Lung activity was quantitated relative to myocardial activity and a lung/myocardial activity ratio was determined for each patient. Stepwise regression analysis was then used to examine the influence of patient clinical characteristics and exercise variables on the lung/myocardium ratio. Peak heart rate during exercise and propranolol usage both showed significant negative regression coefficients (p less than 0.001). No other patient data showed a significant relation. Using the regression equation and the estimated variance, a 95% confidence level upper limit of normal could be determined for a give peak heart rate and propranolol status. Sixty-one other patients were studied to validate the predicted upper limits of normal based on this model. None of the 27 patients without coronary artery disease had an elevated lung/myocardial ratio, compared with 1 of 8 with 1-vessel disease (difference not significant), 6 of 14 with 2-vessel disease (p less than 0.005), and 6 of 12 with 3-vessel disease (p less than 0.0001). Thus, lung activity on upright exercise thallium-201 studies can be quantitated relative to myocardial activity, and is inversely related to peak heart rate and propranolol use. Use of a regression analysis allows determination of a 95% confidence upper limit of normal to be anticipated in an individual patient.", 
    "27": "The present protocol was designed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol or diltiazem, 3 agents with different mechanisms of action and potentially different effects on myocardial function, reverses left ventricular filling abnormalities. Twelve patients with essential hypertension and no evidence of associated cardiovascular disease, either clinically or with noninvasive testing, were evaluated while taking no medication and after 2 months of treatment with these agents. All 3 drugs produced equivalent control of blood pressure (BP), reducing sitting systolic BP by a mean of 20 to 24 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 14 to 16 mm Hg. LV ejection fraction and end-diastolic volume were normal in all but 1 subject (who was excluded from the analyses of LV diastolic filling) and were not altered by drug therapy. The peak LV filling rate and the first-third filling fraction were reduced in the patients with hypertension, but neither of these indexes nor the time to peak filling rate were significantly improved for the group as a whole by any of these medications. Nine of 10 patients whose BP was controlled by diltiazem had increases in their first-third filling fraction, but this change did not reach statistical significance. Our findings suggest that abnormalities of LV diastolic filling are not consistently affected by short-term therapy in patients with chronic, previously treated systemic hypertension.", 
    "28": "Some investigators found that isoxsuprine, propranolol, or heparin would increase skin-flap survival in loose-skinned animals. We evaluated the effects of these three drugs in the pig, an animal with skin circulation similar to that of humans. Four hundred ventrally based skin flaps that have a proximal axial portion and a distal random portion were made on the flanks of 40 pigs. There were eight study groups: control, isoxsuprine preoperatively and postoperatively, propranolol preoperatively and postoperatively, isoxsuprine postoperatively only, propranolol postoperatively only, heparin, single-stage surgical delay, and two-stage surgical delay. Flap survival was improved by the two-stage surgical delay when compared with the control flaps, flaps from pigs receiving a drug, or flaps from pigs having a single-stage surgical delay (p less than 0.001). When compared with the control flaps, neither isoxsuprine, propranolol, heparin, nor single-stage surgical delay significantly increased flap survival.", 
    "29": "Panic attacks are surprisingly common in the United States, costing our economy more than $100 million per year in disability benefits and health care expenses. However, diagnosis is difficult and consequently many patients are treated for other conditions. When an underlying disorder is determined to be present, treatment of that disorder may ameliorate attacks. If none is present, panic symptoms will respond to a variety of drugs. Behavioral therapy may be necessary in severe cases or as adjunctive therapy after attacks abate.", 
    "30": "The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist Timolol Maleate (0.5%) was employed topically to determine whether the resting (or \"tonic\") position of accommodation is a consequence of steady-state equilibrium between parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of the ciliary muscle. Ten subjects were used, eight men and two women, with an age range of 19-37 (mean = 23.2). All subjects wore an optimum refractive correction giving visual acuities of 20/20 or better. Darkroom measurements of tonic accommodation (TA), tonic vergence (TV), and pupil diameter were determined with a Badal laser optometer , a nonius alignment device and infra-red photography, respectively. Far and near points of accommodation and oculo-motor balance tests were determined by standard optometric techniques and intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by applanation tonometry. Both TA (mean = 1.66 D) and TV (mean = 2.10 deg) assumed intermediate resting positions in the absence of visual stimulation. A double-blind protocol between Timolol and Saline demonstrated a mean myopic shift in TA of +0.85 D over 40 min with Timolol. All other experimental parameters, apart from IOP, were unaffected by Timolol. It is concluded that sympathetic innervation to the ciliary muscle plays a significant role in determining the TA position and that this innervation is mediated by inhibitory beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "31": "We studied the effects of daily ip administration of T4 (200 micrograms/100 g BW) or T3 (50 micrograms/100 g) to the rat (six per group) for 3 days with or without sodium ipodate (6 mg/100 g), propylthiouracil (PTU; 2 mg/100 g), propranolol (0.5 mg/100 g), or amiodarone (2.5 mg/100 g) on cardiac weight, 3',5'-diiodothyronine (3',5'-T2) to 3'-monoiodothyronine monodeiodinating activity (MA), mitochondrial alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (alpha GPD), and/or cytosolic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). T4 treatment caused a 28% increase in cardiac weight, about an 11-fold increase in 3',5'-T2 MA, about a 27% increase in alpha GPD activity, and about a 129% increase in ODC activity. Administration of ipodate with T4 abolished all effects of T4 on the heart. PTU abolished the effect of T4 on alpha GPD and markedly reduced its effect on 3',5'-T2 MA and ODC activity; it had little effect on cardiac hypertrophy caused by T4 treatment. Propranolol reduced the increase in cardiac weight following T4 administration from 28% to 11%, but had a modest or no effect on T4-induced changes in other metabolic variables studied. Amiodarone also reduced the effect of T4 on heart weight, but had little or no influence on 3',5'-T2 MA, the only metabolic variable studied. T3 treatment of the rat caused a 35% increase in heart weight, about a 15-fold increase in 3',5'-T2 MA, about a 35% increase in alpha GPD, and about a 100% increase in ODC activity. Ipodate and PTU reduced the increase in 3',5'-T2 MA following T3 administration, but had no appreciable influence on heart weight, alpha GPD, and/or ODC activity. Propranolol and amiodarone had no significant effect on any of the changes studied after T3 administration. It was concluded that: 1) ipodate markedly lessens or abolishes the effects of T4 on the heart; 2) propranolol and amiodarone decrease cardiac hypertrophy in response to T4 administration, but have little or no effect on metabolic changes due to T4; 3) PTU curtails the metabolic effects of T4 on the heart but has little effect on cardiac hypertrophy; 4) none of the drugs studied affects cardiac changes occurring after T3 administration. The changes observed in 3',5'-T2 MA after ipodate and PTU treatment may have been a result of direct interaction of the drugs with the deiodinase.", 
    "32": "We evaluated the electrophysiologic effects of intravenous metoprolol, a selective beta-1-blocking agent, in 12 patients. Electrophysiologic parameters were measured during the control period, immediately following, and 4 to 6 hours after infusion of 0.15 mg/kg. Metoprolol serum concentration was serially measured in 6 of the 12 patients. Immediately after metoprolol infusion, the sinus cycle length increased by 20% from 738 +/- 166 msec to 885 +/- 181 msec (p less than 0.01), AH interval during sinus rhythm increased by 34% from 83 +/- 27 msec to 112 +/- 37 msec (p less than 0.01), and antegrade atrioventricular (AV) nodal Wenckebach cycle length increased by 20% from 360 +/- 188 msec to 432 +/- 199 msec (p less than 0.01). Sinus node recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time did not become abnormally prolonged in any patient. His-Purkinje conduction was unaltered. High atrial and ventricular refractory periods were modestly increased (less than 15 msec); the increase in refractoriness reached statistical significance when repeat measurements were made at 4 to 6 hours. No adverse effects were noted. Metoprolol serum concentration at the time of peak measured electrophysiologic effect was 54.6 +/- 15.2 ng/ml. We conclude that at this dose, intravenous metoprolol significantly prolongs sinus cycle length and AV nodal conduction, may modestly increase atrial and ventricular refractoriness, and appears to have electrophysiologic potency similar to propranolol. It is well tolerated following intravenous administration and may be of particular value in the acute treatment of supraventricular tachycardia when beta-receptor selectivity is desired.", 
    "33": "A young woman with palpitation and syncope was found to have ventricular tachyarrhythmia and a congenital long QT interval. The QT interval was shortened and the arrhythmia suppressed by propranolol. Electrograms recorded at various sites in both ventricles revealed a distinct diastolic slow wave that followed the T wave and measured 1.1 mV. Epinephrine infusion and emotion augumented this diastolic wave and induced ventricular ectopic complexes arising from this potential. Similar endocardial recordings in eight patients without a long QT interval showed diastolic slow waves that never exceeded 0.28 mV. In normal canine myocardium, afterdepolarizations can be induced by norepinephrine and blocked by propranolol. These findings suggest that the long QT syndrome is associated with abnormally large afterdepolarizations in ventricular myocardial cells, which are enhanced by beta-adrenergic stimulation to attain threshold and produce firing.", 
    "34": "Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia with Wenckebach block is an uncommon electrocardiographic finding. Electrophysiologic studies performed in a patient who exhibited this phenomenon indicated that the tachycardia was not caused by either sinus node or intraatrial reentry or abnormal automaticity. The tachycardia cycle length decreased after atropine administration and increased in response to propranolol. Administration of either adenosine (75 to 112.5 micrograms/kg) or verapamil (10 mg) terminated individual episodes of tachycardia. After verapamil and when atrial extrastimuli were introduced, dissociation of atrial activity from His-ventricular activity could be observed even though atrioventricular (AV) nodal block with a clear Wenckebach periodicity could also occur. These findings suggest that paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia may be produced by reentry located solely within the upper portion of the AV node.", 
    "35": "Although reperfusion of severely ischemic myocardium with thrombolytic agents or surgery has shown reduction in infarct size, the time after coronary occlusion during which reperfusion can salvage ischemic myocardium is limited. To determine whether beta-adrenergic blockade could enhance the salvage of ischemic myocardium by reperfusion, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded in 18 anesthetized dogs. An in vivo area at risk was determined by injecting technetium-99m-labeled albumin microspheres into the left atrium 5 minutes after occlusion and carrying out radioautography to define the poorly perfused tissue. Fifteen minutes after coronary occlusion, the dogs were randomized either to a control (saline-treated) group (n = 8) or to a timolol-treated group (n = 10). Timolol was administered until a decrease of 20% in heart rate or blood pressure occurred (mean total dose = 0.85 +/- 0.22 mg/kg +/- standard error of the mean). Coronary occlusion was maintained for 3 hours and was followed by 3 hours of reperfusion in both groups. At the end of 6 hours, infarct size was defined by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and masses of infarct and risk were calculated. Percent left ventricular mass at risk was similar for both groups (control = 20.9 +/- 2.4%, timolol-treated = 23.7 +/- 2.1%, p = not significant). Mass of necrosis/mass at risk was significantly smaller in the timolol-treated reperfusion group (27.3 +/- 2.7%) versus saline reperfusion alone (46.5 +/- 5.6%) (p less than 0.005). Thus, beta-adrenergic blockade administered early after coronary occlusion results in substantial enhancement of the salvage achieved by reperfusion alone.", 
    "36": "In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, wedged hepatic venous pressure closely reflects portal venous pressure. This study was carried out to determine if propranolol-induced reductions in portal venous pressure are accurately evaluated by the measurement of wedged hepatic venous pressure. Hepatic venous cannulation and percutaneous transhepatic catheterization of the portal vein were simultaneously performed in 7 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. One hour after oral administration of 40 mg of propranolol, wedged hepatic and portal venous pressures significantly decreased from 24.3 +/- 3.5 (mean +/- SD) to 19.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg, and from 24.7 +/- 3.9 to 22.4 +/- 3.6 mmHg, respectively. Although no significant difference was found between baseline wedged hepatic and portal venous pressures, a significant difference was found between these pressures after propranolol administration. We concluded that during acute administration of a drug acting on the splanchnic circulation, the measurement of wedged hepatic venous pressure may not provide a reliable estimation of the magnitude of the changes in portal venous pressure. There is, however, no evidence that the direction of the changes might not be adequately assessed by wedged hepatic venous pressure measurement.", 
    "37": "Enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction (EAVC) comprises a portion of the spectrum of atrioventricular node electrophysiology in which physiologic slowing of atrioventricular conduction is diminished. To evaluate the basis of EAVC in humans, we compared the effect of pharmacologic autonomic blockade on electrophysiologic characteristics of atrioventricular nodal conduction and refractoriness in 10 patients with EAVC and 12 patients without EAVC (non-EAVC). The effects of autonomic blockade (0.2 mg/kg iv propranolol and 0.04 mg/kg iv atropine) on sinus cycle length and atrial refractory period were similar in both EAVC and non-EAVC patients. After autonomic blockade, minimum atrial paced cycle length with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction lengthened in EAVC patients (control, 268 +/- 25 msec; blockade, 307 +/- 34 msec; p less than .01), but remained unchanged in non-EAVC patients (control, 392 +/- 69 msec; blockade, 382 +/- 49 msec; p = NS). Similarly, atrioventricular nodal functional refractory periods tended to lengthen in EAVC patients, while remaining unchanged or shortening in non-EAVC patients. Furthermore, although autonomic blockade reduced differences between EAVC and non-EAVC patients, both minimum cycle length with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction and atrioventricular functional refractory period remained shorter in EAVC than in non-EAVC patients (p less than .02). Thus, baseline differences in autonomic atrioventricular nodal control differ in EAVC and non-EAVC patients, but do not fully account for differences in atrioventricular nodal electrophysiologic properties in these patients. Consequently, underlying structural functional factors may play an important role in determining the range of atrioventricular nodal electrophysiologic characteristics in man.", 
    "38": "Ninety patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery were studied prospectively by bedside and subsequent ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to investigate the incidence, possible causes, and prevention of atrial fibrillation. Patients with good left ventricular function were divided randomly into a control group or groups treated with digoxin or propranolol. In the control group the incidence of atrial fibrillation was 27% and of significant ventricular extrasystoles 3%. Propranolol reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation (14.8%), whereas digoxin had no effect and increased the incidence of ventricular extrasystoles. Age, sex, severity of symptoms, cardiomegaly, heart failure, previous myocardial infarction, and number of grafts did not affect the result. The operative myocardial ischaemic time was related to the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. There was also a significant relation between atrial fibrillation and bundle branch block. Atrial fibrillation is common after coronary artery grafting; it may be due to diffuse myocardial ischaemia or hypothermic injury. The incidence may be reduced by beta blockade.", 
    "39": "Thirteen of 30 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia demonstrated systolic blood pressure readings above 113 mm Hg on at least three separate occasions. In contrast, only one of 22 infants without BPD developed hypertension. The onset of hypertension often followed discharge from the nursery, was transient, and responded well to antihypertensive medication. Its significance is exemplified by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy in three infants and a cerebrovascular accident in one child. We conclude that systemic hypertension is a significant problem in infants with BPD, and recommend close monitoring of blood pressure during their follow-up care.", 
    "40": "The effects of chlorpromazine (100 mg p.o., 2 hr before propranolol) on the disposition and beta-adrenergic blocking actions of both intravenous (6 mg) and oral (40 mg) propranolol were studied in the dog. Chlorpromazine pretreatment significantly reduced (69%) the oral clearance of propranolol, resulting in significant increases in propranolol bioavailability (159%), and in the total beta-adrenergic blocking activity (111%) after the oral dose. The increase in the total beta-adrenergic blocking activity of oral propranolol after chlorpromazine pretreatment was mostly due to an increased contribution from the parent compound; the apparent activity from active propranolol metabolites was not affected by chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine pretreatment had no significant influence on the systemic clearance, elimination half-life, apparent volume of distribution, and plasma binding of propranolol, or on the apparent hepatic blood flow. After intravenous propranolol, chlorpromazine pretreatment had no effect on either the total amount of beta-adrenergic blocking activity or the amount of activity attributable to active metabolites. The decreased oral propranolol clearance by chlorpromazine was seen as a shift to the left in the propranolol dose vs. AUC relationship, eliminating the apparent nonlinear kinetic behavior of oral propranolol, and reducing the apparent oral threshold dose. Chlorpromazine's major, if not only, effect on propranolol disposition was to reduce the presystemic elimination of propranolol, possibly through inhibition of its metabolism via a pathway other than ring oxidation.", 
    "41": "(-)-Propranolol displaced 5-HT1 and 5-HT1B receptor binding (pIC50 6.76 and 6.31 respectively) and antagonized the inhibitory effect of 5-HT on continuous K+ (25 mM) evoked release of [3H]5-HT from superfused rat frontal cortex slices (apparent pA2 6.67). (+)-Propranolol was essentially inactive in all tests. The results support the claim that the 5-HT autoreceptor has a pharmacological resemblance to the 5-HT1 recognition site and in particular to the low affinity 5-HT1B subtype of this site.", 
    "42": "The effect of acute adrenalectomy and the action of propranolol on insulin-stimulated glucose utilization was investigated in an in vivo model of peripheral tissues of the rabbit after evisceration and nephrectomy. The lactate/pyruvate ratios in muscle and blood and the content of energy-rich phosphate compounds in muscle were not altered during the experiments. The results obtained in animals with and without intact adrenals were compared. The insulin-mediated glucose utilization was inhibited by 34% in animals with intact adrenals. In the semimembranosus muscle of adrenalectomized rabbits the parameters of glucose metabolism corresponded to those in the 'resting state'. In the muscle of animals with intact adrenals the content of glycogen was decreased and that of glycolytic intermediates was elevated; free glucose was accumulated in the muscle cell. Alterations of the glucose content in skeletal muscle were inversely correlated with the glucose utilization of peripheral tissues. DL-Propranolol (0.05 mg/kg) administered before surgery i.v. to rabbits with intact adrenals not only prevented glycogenolysis and accumulation of glycolytic intermediates but also the stress-mediated glucose accumulation in skeletal muscle. Propranolol abolished the insulin resistance of glucose utilization of peripheral tissues mediated by the adrenals after surgical preparation of the rabbits.", 
    "43": "In a double-blind cross-over study, the influence of propranolol on postural stability was investigated in 7 normals. The postural stability was measured by a computer-assisted quantitative Romberg test. A dose of 10 mg propranolol administered intravenously resulted in an impaired postural stability, with a delay of about half an hour. This delay could be responsible for the missing correlation between the sway and plasma-propranolol.", 
    "44": "The unique effect of clonidine in facilitating habituation of the acoustic startle response [10] was replicated. However, clonidine had no effect on between-session habituation, showing a pharmacological dissociation between short- and long-term habituation. Systematic manipulation of ISI showed clonidine's habituation-facilitating effect to be most striking with longer within-session ISIs where habituation was relatively weak in controls. Comparing clonidine's effect to that of two other hypotensive agents, prazosin and propranolol, showed that the habituation-facilitating effect was not due to blood pressure effects. Prazosin, an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker, facilitated short-term habituation, but significantly less so than did clonidine, an alpha 2-agonist. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, had no effect on short-term habituation. Both prazosin and propranolol impaired long-term habituation, but propranolol did so without suppressing initial response levels. The data suggest that a synapse with both alpha-1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors may be critically involved in habituation of the acoustic startle response. A beta-adrenergic involvement in long-term habituation is tentatively suggested.", 
    "45": "Some behavioural and biochemical consequences of the administration of RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-1H-indole), a drug which has been shown to be a potent displacing agent at the 5-HT1 binding site, have been studied in mice and rats. In both species RU 24969 produced a dose-dependent increase in locomotor activity. No head-weaving, head-twitching or reciprocal forepaw treading (behaviour suggested to be 5-HT2 receptor mediated) were seen, nor did the body temperature increase p-Chlorophenylalanine did not alter either the behaviour or its intensity. Pretreatment with both methysergide (10 mg/kg) and metergoline (2.5 mg/kg) enhanced the behavioural response in rats, whilst haloperidol (100 micrograms/kg) inhibited the response. Propranolol caused a small and variable decrease in the increase in locomotion induced by RU 24969 in both mice and rats. The drug RU 24969 (10 mg/kg) inhibited the rate of synthesis of 5-HT in rat brain by about 50%. Pretreatment of rats with desmethylimipramine over a longer term or clenbuterol given acutely, treatments known to enhance the behavioural responses of rats to various other 5-HT agonists, did not alter the RU 24969-induced response. Repeated administration of electroconvulsive shock, however, did produce an enhanced locomotor response to RU 24969. The results obtained are consistent with the view that administration of 5-HT agonists, such as quipazine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, produces behaviour that results from stimulation of both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor populations.", 
    "46": "Direct recording of the sinus node potential in the bipolar mode using two electrodes of a quadripolar recording catheter positioned in the region of the sinus node at the junction of the superior vena cava to the right atrium was performed in 24 patients. Asynchronous overdrive atrial pacing was carried out using Strauss 'technique. Pharmacological denervation was carried out using intravenous propranolol (0,02 mg/kg) and atropine (0,04 mg/kg) using Jose's technique. An intravenous injection of a bolus of 20 mg of ATP was given in 3 cases. The sinus potential was identified by morphological criteria and confirmed after carotid sinus compression and atrial extrastimuli to exclude artefacts, especially the end of ventricular repolarisation of the preceding complex. The sinoatrial conduction time measured directly under basal conditions was considered normal when within 80 to 150 ms. Direct measurement of the sinus potential in the diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction seems to be less useful than the indirect techniques. On the other hand, it does confirm the diagnosis of sinoatrial block: five cases of special interest are described; in four cases the degree of sinoatrial block was variable: a significant increase of sinoatrial conduction time under basal conditions in 1 case; paroxysmal 3rd degree sinoatrial block revealed by programmed atrial stimulation in 2 cases; 2nd degree 2/1 sinoatrial block after injection of ATP in which the direct sinoatrial conduction time and sinus node function had been considered to be normal (1 case).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "In a double-blind, cross-over study the effect and tolerance of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol in a dosage of 80 mg twice daily was compared to that of the beta 1-selective beta-blocker metoprolol 200 mg once daily in Durules (a controlled-release formulation). The attack frequency, migraine days, severity score, consumption of acute medication and subjective evaluation were the main parameters used for evaluation. Thirty-six patients with classical or common migraine were included. Thirty-three completed the investigation. It is concluded from the results that there are no differences in efficacy between metoprolol and propranolol regarding the studied parameters. Both drugs reduced the migraine symptoms compared to the run-in period and were generally well tolerated.", 
    "48": "A wide range of neuropsychiatric side effects are attributed to propranolol including visual hallucinations, somnulence, memory impairment, decrease in response time, dizziness, confusional states, insomnia, nightmares, fatigue, sedation and depression. Benson et al., in a summary review of several clinical studies of 5,846 patients being treated with a variety of beta adrenergic blocking agents, listed depression as a rare side effect of propranolol that was usually reported only after long term treatment at high doses. Despite the widely circulated attribution that depression is a side effect of propranolol, there is a paucity of evidence to directly link this drug with clinically significant mood disturbance. For example, the most widely quoted reference attributing propranolol as a depressogenic agent was a \"letter to the editor\" which was a retrospective, uncontrolled, unblinded study that did not use a standardized depression rating scale. Most of the evidence linking propranolol to depressive symptoms have derived from scattered case reports in which the onset of depressive symptoms were attributed to this agent. Given the well known cyclic onset and remissions of affective disorders, and the prevalence of depression in the general medical population as a whole, the role of propranolol in these cases is debatable.", 
    "49": "The effects of endogenous Plasma Renin Substrate (PRS) on the relationship between Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) and the Plasma Renin Concentration (PRC) have been studied in hyperthyroid rats, by I-triiodothyronine (T3) administration and in hypothyroid rats, by propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment, to clarify if PRA changes are an adequate index for evaluating the renin-angiotensin changes during the alterations in the thyroid function. Although in experimental situations studied the induced variation on PRC explains a 62 per cent of the changes in PRA, finding a good lineal correlation between both parameters (r = 0.79, P less than 0.001). Not only does PRS play an important role on the kinetic of the enzymatic reaction but also explains jointly with PRC up to a 85 per cent of PRA alterations. PRS changes become more important during thyrotoxicosis where they limit in a higher degree the velocity of reaction due to inverse relationship between PRC and PRS (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001).", 
    "50": "Pindolol eye drops were compared with Timolol in a randomized 4-week investigation carried out in patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma. The two drugs were found to have the same pressure-lowering effect. Pindolol has been used in internal medicine for more than 12 years now. It has less influence on airway resistance than Timolol.", 
    "51": "Various concentrations of Pindolol eye drops (0.17%, 0.35%, 0.5%, 0.72%, 1.0%), a beta-blocking agent with an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were investigated with regard to their pressure-lowering effect in open-angle glaucoma. It was found that all of these concentrations reduce intraocular pressure, but that only the 1% solution has a significantly stronger effect after 24 hours. It is therefore preferable to use this relatively high concentration, especially as it is not accompanied by a bronchopulmonary risk.", 
    "52": "Changes in exercise tolerance under the impact of obsidan, corinfar, isoptin and their combinations were studied in 12 angina patients with the help of bicycle ergometry. The most marked increase in exercise tolerance following the use of a single drug was observed with obsidan (85.1 +/- 35.1%), although corinfar and isoptin also led to a significant elevation in the patients' working capacity (67.4 +/- 14.4% and 49.8 +/- 6.3%, respectively). Combination of isoptin and obsidan brought about no increase in tolerance as compared with obsidan alone whereas the combination of corinfar with obsidan showed the maximal antianginal effect.", 
    "53": "Twelve patients with variant angina combined with angina of effort were examined. Repeated exercise tests prior to the administration of antianginal drugs revealed the spontaneous variability of the patients' tolerance to the exercise and of the pulse-pressure index at the exercise peak which may serve as an indirect sign of the angiospastic factor involvement in clinical manifestations of angina of effort. The treatment of such patients with corinfar and isoptin was associated with the elimination and significant reduction of spontaneous attacks of angina attended by a considerable increase in the exercise tolerance and in the pulse-pressure index at the exercise peak. The treatment with obsidan in these cases was less effective: the incidence of spontaneous anginal attacks changed insignificantly, the tolerance to exercise increased with the reduction of the maximum value of the pulse-pressure index.", 
    "54": "In a double-blind, randomized, crossover, multicenter study performed in 227 hypertensive outpatients, two antihypertensive drugs, oxprenolol and chlorthalidone, were investigated to determine unwanted effects. Three main methodologic procedures were applied: the conventional evaluation of unwanted effects by the physician and involving the whole patient population, the checklist, and the free questionnaire. The latter two were assigned by randomization to the patients themselves. The study showed that unwanted effects seem to be frequently overreported when a checklist is used, whereas the free questionnaire gives more information about the symptoms of the disease than about the tolerance of the drug. The conventional method, when physicians are well-informed and sensitized to the problem, seems to provide more reliable information about unwanted effects of a drug.", 
    "55": "Antihypertensive treatment may be life saving in scleroderma renal crisis. Patients surviving such crises frequently have had dramatic improvement in the dermal manifestations of their scleroderma. To investigate the potential role of antihypertensive treatment in nonhypertensive patients we randomly assigned 28 patients with systemic sclerosis into drug (14) and placebo (14) groups, using blocked randomisation , and followed them up in a prospective, double-blind clinical trial for 24 months. Overall, both groups improved slightly, with both subjective and objective markers. There were no statistically significant differences and no clinically meaningful trends between the 2 groups, except that the blood pressure was reduced in the group on the active drug.",

    "57": "Potassium balance was followed in 12 subjects with hypertension during treatment either with timolol and hydrochlorothiazide or with timolol, hydrochlorothiazide, and amiloride. Subjects treated with the beta-blocker and thiazide developed potassium depletion, which was prevented by concomitant treatment with amiloride. Thiazide augments timolol-induced potassium loss and it is suggested that the renal handling of potassium is changed by other mechanisms. The decrement in potassium loss during concomitant amiloride treatment cannot be explained.", 
    "58": "A single oral dose of 300 mg labetalol was given to 10 subjects with uncomplicated primary hypertension; its effects on blood pressure, heart rate (HR), plasma renin activity (PRA), and plasma concentration of catecholamines and of their major metabolites, octopamine ( OTP ), and dopamine-beta hydroxylase (DbH) were investigated. Although HR did not change after dosing, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased in 2 hr and remained below control up to 12 hr. There was symptomatic orthostatic hypotension in two subjects in the first 2 hr after dosing. PRA decreased in the first 2 hr and followed a gradual rise that became significant at 24 hr. Although DbH did not change, plasma concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) and its major metabolites and of OTP increased between 2 and 4 hr after dosing and remained elevated up to 12 hr. There was no correlation between change in blood pressure and control levels or changes of PRA or NE concentrations.", 
    "59": "The effect of inhibiting prostaglandin (PG) synthesis on basal and frusemide-stimulated renin secretion was examined in the rat isolated perfused kidney. The stable PGI2 derivative, 6-keto PGF1 alpha, was measured by radioimmunoassay in urine collected from the kidney. Treatment of rats with indomethacin (3.0 mg kg-1) reduced 6-keto PGF1 alpha excretion from 121.3 +/- 39.1 (n = 9) to 15.5 +/- 6.6 (n = 9) pg min-1 (P less than 0.02) but had no effect on basal renin secretion. Renal perfusion pressure, flow rate and vascular resistance were similar in treated and control rats. Mean urine flow was lower after treatment. Infusion of frusemide (250 micrograms min-1) did not alter 6-keto PGF1 alpha excretion in control or indomethacin-treated (P greater than 0.05) rats. Although renin secretion was increased during frusemide infusion, there was no significant difference between control (1,806 +/- 384 ng angiotensin I (AI) min-1) and treated (2,310 +/- 554 ng AI min-1) rats (P greater than 0.05). Propranolol, at a dose (8 micrograms min-1) which suppressed renin secretion after isoprenaline stimulation, had no effect on the response to frusemide in indomethacin-treated rats. These results demonstrate that frusemide-stimulated renin secretion in the rat kidney does not require intact renal PGI2 synthesis and is independent of beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "60": "The interaction of beta 1-selective (cardioselective) and nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade with exercise conditioning was investigated in 30 healthy adult persons. A double-blind protocol was used and the effects of atenolol (100 mg/day), propranolol (80 mg twice daily), and placebo were studied by treadmill testing (Bruce protocol) before and after a 2-month supervised program of dynamic exercise. Exercise tolerance was assessed by time and work performed to exhaustion. Subjects who received propranolol, but not those who received atenolol or placebo, showed an acutely impaired exercise tolerance after drug administration but before training (-8 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05). All 3 groups showed significantly improved exercise capacity following training after drug treatment had been discontinued (atenolol, 22 +/- 6% improvement; propranolol, 13 +/- 6%; placebo, 10 +/- 3%). However, when tested while still receiving medication, subjects who received propranolol failed to show significant improvement in exercise capacity. In contrast, patients who received atenolol and placebo improved significantly. The data indicate that enhancement of maximal work capacity by exercise conditioning can occur despite administration of either beta 1-selective or nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. However, the fatiguing effects of propranolol that were evident when work performance during propranolol therapy was compared with work performance while not receiving propranolol before the training program persists after training and may limit the net improvement in work capacity induced by exercise conditioning compared with the pretraining state.", 
    "61": "In isolated adipocytes, fast-acting lipolytic hormones and insulin have been shown previously to control lipolysis by regulating the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme, through an increase or decrease, respectively, of the extent of phosphorylation of the enzyme. Here, we demonstrate that exposure to lipolytic hormones (corticotropin, noradrenaline) led to phosphorylation at two sites on the Mr 84,000 lipase subunit. One, designated \"basal site,\" was phosphorylated also in the absence of any hormonal stimulation, its phosphorylation apparently not being influenced by hormones. The second, designated \"regulatory site,\" was identical to that phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase on the isolated lipase. The regulatory site was not appreciably phosphorylated in the absence of hormones, but exposure of the cells to noradrenaline increased its phosphorylation extent to that of the basal site. Insulin or the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol decreased the extent of phosphorylation of the regulatory site to the low level before stimulation, apparently without effect on the basal site. Phosphoserine was the only phosphorylated amino acid residue at both sites. Limited proteolytic digestion indicated that the two sites were separated by less than about 170 amino acid residues. Thus, control of adipose tissue lipolysis by fast-acting lipolytic hormones and by insulin is exerted through the regulation of the phosphorylation state of a single phosphoserine residue in the hormone-sensitive lipase.", 
    "62": "Three hundred and one patients who had been hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction, were less than 70 years old, were in sinus rhythm, and did not have complete bundle branch block were stratified before discharge according to age, size of infarction, and type of ventricular arrhythmias as determined on a 6 hr electrocardiogram (ECG). They were thereafter randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with 100 mg bid metoprolol or placebo. Repeat 6 hr ECGs were recorded 3 days and 1, 6, and 12 months after treatment had begun. In the placebo group there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with complex premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) (i.e., multiform, paired and R-on-T PVCs, or ventricular tachycardia) as well as increased numbers of PVCs in the patients during the follow-up. In contrast, an initial decrease in the number of PVCs (p less than .001) was found in the metoprolol group, whereas the complexity of PVCs was constant in those patients who continued on metoprolol therapy throughout the follow-up period. We conclude that the increase in complexity and number of PVCs that is part of the natural clinical course after myocardial infarction is counteracted by long-term treatment with metoprolol.", 
    "63": "Young turkeys inbred for congestive cardiomyopathy were treated with propranolol prior to the development of cardiac enlargement. One-day-old inbred and commercial turkeys received propranolol, 2 mg X kg-1 X day-1 for 1 month. Propranolol treated inbred birds showed a significantly reduced mortality from 5 to 15 days of age when compared with untreated inbred birds. However, by 28 days of age, cumulative mortality in the treated inbred birds was equal to that in the untreated inbred birds, 29 and 32%, respectively. Propranolol-treated and untreated commercial birds have a 28-day cumulative mortality of 5%. Ca2+ transport in isolated cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum was studied at 10 and 28 days of age. At 10 days of age Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ binding in propranolol-treated birds was reduced to 56% and 83%, respectively, of values in untreated inbred birds. By 28 days of age Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ binding in treated and untreated inbred birds were similar. Ca2+-stimulated ATPase activity was significantly elevated in treated inbred birds compared with age-matched untreated inbred birds at 10 and 28 days of age. Ca2+ transport in isolated cardiac SR from propranolol-treated commercial control birds was not significantly different from the values in untreated commercial birds at 10 or 28 days of age. Improvement in early mortality may be due to the prevention of arrhythmias. Propranolol alters Ca2+ transport in isolated cardiac SR from inbred birds by uncoupling Ca2+-stimulated ATPase. Whether this is due to a direct effect of propranolol on the SR membrane or occurs from its beta-adrenergic blocking action is unclear.", 
    "64": "These studies tested the effects of isoproterenol on potassium secretion in the isolated perfused cortical collecting tubule. Isoproterenol, 10(-6) M (n = 6) and 10(-4) M (n = 2), added to bathing solution produced a significant fall in potassium secretion [13.5 +/- 1.2 to 8.0 +/- 0.9 peq X mm-1 X min-1 (P less than 0.01)] and in transepithelial voltage (P less than 0.01) compared with time controls (n = 9). Pretreatment with propranolol abolished this effect (n = 4). Addition of propranolol alone to the bath caused no significant change in potassium secretion (n = 8). 8-[p-Chlorophenylthio]cAMP (10(-4) M, isotonic perfusate) added to the bath produced a significant fall in potassium secretion [11.5 +/- 1.7 to 7.2 +/- 1.3 peq X mm-1 X min-1, n = 7 (P less than 0.01)]. Arginine vasopressin (25 microU/ml), which also stimulates adenylate cyclase activity in this segment, had no significant effect on potassium secretion (n = 10). When chloride was replaced by methyl sulfate in all solutions (n = 6), there was a significant attenuation in the fall in potassium secretion in experiments with 10(-6) M isoproterenol compared with experiments with chloride-containing bath solutions (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that isoproterenol has a specific action of reducing potassium secretion in the cortical collecting tubule either through alternating chloride transport per se or through some other effect dependent on the presence of chloride (e.g., hydrogen ion secretion). Also, this effect is probably mediated by cAMP-dependent events. The lack of effect of vasopressin on potassium secretion suggests that separate cells or cellular pools of cAMP are involved in hormonal stimulation by isoproterenol and vasopressin in this nephron segment.", 
    "65": "The relationship between left ventricular end-systolic pressure and volume has been proposed as a model of left ventricular contraction which may be useful for quantifying inotropic state independent of preload and afterload. Although the model has been well-validated in isolated hearts, systematic evaluation in conscious animals with an intact peripheral circulation has been limited. Accordingly, we derived end-systolic pressure-volume relationships in twelve conscious dogs, chronically instrumented to measure left ventricular pressure and dimensions from endocardial ultrasonic crystals in three orthogonal axes. We examined the linearity of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, its response to alterations of inotropic state and the peripheral circulation, and the influence of beta-adrenergic reflexes. End-systolic pressure-volume relationships were constructed by linear regression of end-systolic pressure-volume coordinates produced by transient inferior vena caval occlusions during atrial pacing. The relations were highly linear; of 127 inferior vena caval occlusions, the correlation coefficient was 0.96 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD). The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship was not significantly altered either by a moderate resistive afterload induced by angiotensin II infusion, or by a moderate increase in preload produced by dextran, but was increased from 4.7 +/- 2.3 to 6.5 +/- 2.2 mm Hg/ml (P less than 0.05) in response to the positive inotropic stimulus of dobutamine. The volume intercept at zero end-systolic pressure was unaffected by dextran or dobutamine, but was decreased from 12 +/- 8 to 5 +/- 11 ml (P less than 0.01) by angiotensin II infusion, indicating a leftward shift of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "66": "We investigated the effects of alpha and/or beta adrenergic blockade (with phentolamine and/or propranolol) on glucose homeostasis during exercise in six normal subjects and in seven Type I diabetic subjects. The diabetics received a low dose insulin infusion (0.07 mU/kg X min) designed to maintain plasma glucose at approximately 150 mg/dl. In normals, neither alpha, beta, nor combined alpha and beta adrenergic blockade altered glucose production, glucose uptake, or plasma glucose concentration during exercise. In diabetics, exercise alone produced a decline in glucose concentration from 144 to 116 mg/dl. This was due to a slightly diminished rise in hepatic glucose production in association with a normal increase in glucose uptake. When exercise was performed during beta adrenergic blockade, the decline in plasma glucose was accentuated. An exogenous glucose infusion (2.58 mg/kg X min) was required to prevent glucose levels from falling below 90 mg/dl. The effect of beta blockade was accounted for by a blunted rise in hepatic glucose production and an augmented rise in glucose utilization. These alterations were unrelated to changes in plasma insulin and glucagon levels, which were similar in the presence and absence of propranolol. In contrast, when the diabetics exercised during alpha adrenergic blockade, plasma glucose concentration rose from 150 to 164 mg/dl. This was due to a significant increase in hepatic glucose production and a small decline in exercise-induced glucose utilization. These alterations also could not be explained by differences in insulin and glucagon levels. We conclude that the glucose homeostatic response to exercise in insulin-dependent diabetics, in contrast to healthy controls, is critically dependent on the adrenergic nervous system.", 
    "67": "Parallel measurements of plasma alpha-melanotropin-like immunoreactivity (alpha-MSH-LI) and beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-END-LI) were used to examine the differential adrenergic control of beta-END secretion from the anterior lobe (AL) versus the intermediate lobe (IL) of the rat pituitary gland in vivo. Changes in plasma alpha-MSH-LI levels after treatment with various adrenergic agents served as an index of the secretion of the peptides by the IL. Secretion of beta-END-LI from the AL in vivo was evaluated using the selective inhibitory effects of dexamethasone on AL release. Inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis by metyrapone or activation of alpha-adrenoceptors by clonidine increased (P less than 0.05) plasma levels of beta-END-LI while plasma levels of alpha-MSH-LI were not affected by either treatment. By contrast, peripherally administered isoproterenol, norepinephrine or epinephrine, each increased plasma levels of alpha-MSH-LI together with beta-END-LI in a dose-dependent manner. The synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, significantly attenuated the rise in plasma beta-END-LI induced by norepinephrine and epinephrine but did not affect the rise in alpha-MSH-LI. The isoproterenol-induced rises in beta-END-LI and alpha-MSH-LI were inhibited by the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol. By contrast, the alpha-adrenergic blockers, phentolamine or prazosin, reversed the effect of epinephrine on both peptides while propranolol had no significant effect. The effects of epinephrine, therefore, appear to be alpha-adrenergic, whereas those of isoproterenol are beta-adrenergic. These studies extend earlier findings to indicate that clonidine is a selective activator of AL corticotroph secretion in vivo. On the other hand, other adrenergic agents such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, and isoproterenol appear to stimulate secretion from both corticotrophs as well as melanotrophs.", 
    "68": "In the rats subjected to a mild stress of immobilization impromidine, and H2-receptor agonist, given 60 min prior to the stress, intensified the stress-induced increase in hypophyseal-adrenocortical response, evaluated indirectly through the corticosterone concentration in the blood serum. Impromidine was far more potent but only about half as efficient as histamine, 4-methyl histamine (4-MH) and dimaprit. The effect of impromidine was abolished by pretreatment of the rats with cimetidine. The alpha-adrenergic blockers phenoxybenzamine, phentolamine and yohimbine, almost totally antagonized the corticosterone response to impromidine in stressed rats. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, abolished the corticosterone response to impromidine but did not antagonize the response to 4-MH and dimaprit. The effect of impromidine was not modified by i.c.v. pretreatment of the rats with atropine. The results obtained show that impromidine is far more potent but less efficient than histamine and the previously known selective H2-receptor agonists in inducing the pituitary-adrenocortical response in stressed rats. These results also suggest that impromidine may release norepinephrine but not interact with cholinergic receptors while stimulating the corticosterone response in stressed rats.", 
    "69": "Thyroid hormone has been shown to accelerate fetal lung development, but the mechanisms by which this hormone acts are yet unknown. Since this hormone may act indirectly by potentiating the action of endogenous catecholamines, we studied this mechanism by measuring beta-adrenergic receptors in fetal lung. Fetal rabbits at 27 days of gestation were treated with triiodothyronine (T3), 100 micrograms/100 g, in the presence and absence of propranolol, 200 micrograms/100 g, or actinomycin D, 20 micrograms/100 g. Fetuses were killed by decapitation either after 4 or 24 h of T3 treatment. The beta-adrenergic antagonist l-[3H]dihydroalprenolol was used to directly estimate the number and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptor in lung membranes. T3 increased the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in fetal lung, but the affinity of binding did not change. The enhancement of binding capacity after 4 h of T3 treatment was not inhibited by actinomycin D. However, 24-h T3-mediated stimulation was partially blocked by actinomycin D. In addition, T3 stimulated the catecholamine content, adenylate cyclase activity, and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate content of lung. T3 increased the lecithin-to-sphingomyelin ratio, phosphatidylglycerol, and disaturated phosphatidylcholine content of the pulmonary lavage fluid. These parameters were completely inhibited by propranolol after 4 h and partially inhibited by actinomycin D after 24 h. Thus thyroid hormone enhances lung maturation by increasing the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in fetal lung.", 
    "70": "The influence on nucleic acids synthesis and DNA integrity of the D-isomer and of the DL-racemic form of the oncogenic beta-blocker 1-(2-nitro-3-methyl-phenoxy)-3-tert-butylamino-propan-2-ol (ZAMI 1305) and of the non-oncogenic beta-blocker propranolol was tested in vitro and in vivo. Both D- and DL-ZAMI 1305, when added in vitro to nuclei isolated from rat liver, cause inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis and DNA fragmentation, as evaluated by alkaline sucrose gradient analysis, in a similar dose-dependent fashion. D- and DL-ZAMI 1305 also inhibit to a similar extent the activity of DNA polymerase alpha and beta from regenerating rat liver. When administered in vivo to female rats both D and DL-ZAMI 1305 cause a dose-dependent fragmentation of liver DNA. The D-isomer and DL-racemic form of the non-oncogenic beta-blocker propranolol inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis and cause DNA fragmentation when added in vitro to isolated liver nuclei, being instead without effect when administered in vivo.", 
    "71": "The structure and pharmacokinetics relationship of 14-beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was investigated in humans. Statistically significant linear and parabolic correlations were found to exist between standard and derived mean pharmacokinetic parameters and the apparent octanol/buffer (pH 7.4) partition coefficient of the compounds. The lipophilic/hydrophilic properties were the primary determinants for the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compounds. Most of the pharmacokinetic parameters were also significantly correlated with the plasma protein/plasma water partition coefficient for the compounds. When the values of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the individual compounds were predicted from the regressions on the apparent partition coefficients in octanol/buffer (pH 7.4) and in plasma protein/plasma water, the error was on average 60%.", 
    "72": "Twelve patients with severe hypertension of different causes, resistant to conventional antihypertensive agents and also to maximum doses of either minoxidil or captopril added to other combinations, were effectively controlled with the association of small doses of minoxidil and captopril plus a diuretic and a beta-blocker. The untoward effects which were previously present in all the patients with maximum doses of minoxidil and in one of the patients treated with captopril disappeared or greatly diminished shortly after this association was started. The different mechanisms of action and opposite side effects of minoxidil and captopril provide the rationale for a combined treatment with the two drugs.", 
    "73": "In cats exposed to bleeding (exsanguination of 15 ml X kg bwt-1) the microsphere technique was used to determine regional vascular resistances in a large number of tissues before and after i.v. administration of the 'selective' beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551. beta 2-blockade significantly raised vascular resistance in the stomach (+ 26%), small (+ 25%) and large (+ 38%) intestine, pancreas (+ 29%), kidney (+ 39%), omental (+ 33%) and subcutaneous (+ 26%) fat, 'white' skeletal muscle (+ 19%), and skin (+ 24%). These findings indicate that, with intact beta-adrenoceptors, beta 2-adrenergic dilator interaction counteracted the hemorrhage evoked vasoconstrictor influences. beta 2-blockade also evoked quite a strong increase of total peripheral resistance (19%) and led to some redistribution of cardiac output. It is concluded that beta 2-adrenergic inhibition of vascular tone significantly seems to improve tissue perfusion during bleeding in several vascular areas. Such effects may be of special significance during severe hemorrhage. In the intestine, pancreas, and adipose tissue, for example, protection against excessive vasoconstriction may serve to minimize the severe metabolic disturbances with secondary release of toxic factors into the circulation reported during hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "74": "The effect of acute beta 1-blockade (100 mg metoprolol) and beta 1/2-blockade (2 mg levobunolol) on exercise performance and metabolism was studied in 16 healthy male physical education students. The study was carried out in a randomized double blind cross-over fashion. The maximal oxygen uptake was unchanged in all conditions, but maximal exercise capacity was reduced by 4% (beta 1-blockade) and 5% (beta 1/2-blockade). Maximal lactate concentration was reduced by 10% (beta 1-blockade) and 20% (beta 1/2-blockade). In 50 min treadmill exercise with 68% of maximal exercise capacity, beta 1/2-blockade led to premature exhaustion in 50% of subjects. Moreover, blood levels of glucose decreased (in some subjects to about 2.5 mmol X 1(-1], while the values were unchanged under beta 1-blockade. Free fatty acids and glycerol were similarly reduced by both beta-blocking agents. HGH, cortisol, adrenalin, and noradrenalin increased under beta-blockade, but more under beta 1/2-blockade than under beta 1-blockade. Insulin remained unchanged as compared with the unmedicated condition. The perceived exertion was elevated under both beta-blocking agents.", 
    "75": "Beta 1-blockade affects exercise performance, especially endurance performance, less than beta 1/2-blockade due to unaffected beta 2-receptors mediating glycogenolysis in the skeletal muscles.", 
    "76": "The chronotropic effects of dopamine were studied in the conscious dog with chronic A-V block. Dopamine at 12.5-200 micrograms/kg and 12.5-50 micrograms/kg/min lowered atrial rate independently of dose. After blockade of muscarine receptors or alpha-adrenoceptors, it raised atrial rate. After blockade of dopamine receptors, dopamine still lowered atrial rate, and did so dose-relatedly after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. It raised ventricular rate, and at high doses also induced ventricular rhythm disorders. Blockade of muscarine receptors enhanced the ventricular cardioaccelerator effect of dopamine (P less than 0.025) at 100 micrograms/kg, while blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors reduced it (P less than 0.05). Blockade of dopamine receptors did not modify this effect, but blockade of beta-adrenoceptors reversed it. Dopamine at 25-200 micrograms/kg raised mean blood pressure. This effect was enhanced by blockade of muscarine receptors, reversed by blockade of alpha-adrenoceptors, and was unaffected by blockade of beta-adrenoceptors or dopamine receptors. These results show that the atrial cardiomoderator effect of dopamine is a vagal reflex response to its hypertensive action, and that it is limited by its direct beta-adrenergic stimulating action. They also show that the ventricular cardioaccelerator effect of dopamine is attenuated by a reflex vagal depressor effect consequent to the induced hypertension. No evidence was found for the existence of positive chronotropic dopamine receptors in either atria or ventricles.", 
    "77": "Electrical stimulation of the transected right vagus nerve in anesthetized and atropinized dogs produced tachycardia that was not attenuated by beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Naloxone in intravenous doses of 1 and 4 mg/kg antagonized the tachycardia evoked by nerve stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. However, the attenuation was maximal at approximately 55% of the control response. These results suggest that an endogenous opiate peptide(s) may have a mediator or modulator role in nonadrenergic tachycardia evoked by vagal nerve stimulation in anesthetized and atropinized dogs.", 
    "78": "The genetically controlled polymorphism causing decreased metabolism of debrisoquine is closely related to that of the metabolism of bufuralol and numerous other drugs and has important clinical consequences. A sensitive in vitro assay was developed which quantifies the production of 1'-hydroxy-bufuralol (carbinol) from bufuralol in human liver microsomes. Initial formation rates of carbinol suggested Michaelis-Menten kinetics with an apparent KM of 61 and 171 mumol l-1 and Vmax of 3.2 and 5.8 nmol mg-1 microsomal protein h-1 in two human liver samples. The Vmax in microsomes of thirty-two liver samples was 4.2 +/- 1.0 (SD) nmol carbinol mg-1 protein h-1. Metabolism of debrisoquine in vivo, as expressed by the 'metabolic ratio' of debrisoquine over 4-OH debrisoquine correlated (r = -0.65, P less than 0.01; n = 18) with carbinol production rate in microsomes in vitro. Microsomes of one individual identified as poor metabolizer of debrisoquine in vivo showed reduction of carbinol formation to 1.97 nmol mg-1 h-1. Mixing his microsomes with those of an extensive metabolizer resulted in additive formation of carbinol excluding mediation of the defect by a soluble inhibitor. These data support the concept of a primary defect in microsomal oxidation of bufuralol. The described assay offers a sensitive tool to investigate the molecular mechanism of the 'debrisoquine polymorphism'.", 
    "79": "Prenalterol was given to twenty five patients with acute myocardial infarction. Thirteen patients (group B) had signs of cardiac decompensation while twelve (group A) had not. Ejection fraction was determined with 99mTc-labelled red blood cells before and after prenalterol (50 micrograms kg-1 body weight), intravenously. In group B this procedure was repeated after digitalization 2 days later. The ejection fraction increased significantly in group A after prenalterol injection. In group B, prenalterol produced an increase, but this was not significant. After digitalis the ejection fraction increased significantly and prenalterol produced an additional significant rise. No significant changes in blood pressure occurred. Heart rate increased significantly in both groups after prenalterol injection and decreased significantly after digitalis."
