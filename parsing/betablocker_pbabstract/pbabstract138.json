We studied the effects of pretreatment with the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, losartan, on renal function, tissue injury, inflammatory response and serum aldosterone levels in a model of ischemic ARF.", 
    "1": "Rats underwent unilateral renal ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion (IR), and were pretreated or not with 8 (IRL8) or 80 (IRL80) mg/kg/day of losartan for 3 days.", 
    "2": "IR kidneys showed marked renal dysfunction, epithelial damage, capillary congestion, increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and increased TNF-alpha, IL1-beta and IL-6 mRNA levels. IRL80 kidneys showed protection against dysfunction and tissue injury, associated with normal MPO activity and cytokine mRNA levels. The lower dose was not able to achieve the same degree of functional renoprotection and could not prevent an increase of MPO or proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels. The high losartan dose completely prevented an increase of serum aldosterone levels induced by IR.", 
    "3": "Renoprotection of the high losartan dose would be mainly mediated by its anti-inflammatory actions. Our results show a potential pathophysiological role of AT1 activation in promoting renal dysfunction, structural injury, inflammation and aldosterone elevation after IR injury.", 
    "4": "Aminergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been a major focus of pharmaceutical research for many years. Due partly to the lack of reliable receptor structures, drug discovery efforts have been largely ligand-based. The recently determined X-ray structure of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor offers an opportunity to investigate the advantages and limitations inherent in a structure-based approach to ligand discovery against this and related GPCR targets. Approximately 1 million commercially available, \"lead-like\" molecules were docked against the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor structure. On testing of 25 high-ranking molecules, 6 were active with binding affinities <4 microM, with the best molecule binding with a K(i) of 9 nM (95% confidence interval 7-10 nM). Five of these molecules were inverse agonists. The high hit rate, the high affinity of the most potent molecule, the discovery of unprecedented chemotypes among the new inhibitors, and the apparent bias toward inverse agonists among the docking hits, have implications for structure-based approaches against GPCRs that recognize small organic molecules.", 
    "5": "Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and 11 beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) regulate aldosterone and cortisol production, respectively. The expression of these enzymes is promoted by calcium influx through Cav3.2, a T-type calcium channel. Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binds to neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE) to suppress the transcription of NRSE-containing genes. We found a NRSE-like sequence in human CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 genes as well as the CACNA1H gene of many mammalian species. The CACNA1H gene encodes the alpha-subunit of Cav3.2. Here we investigated how NRSF/NRSE regulates aldosterone and cortisol synthesis. Inhibition of endogenous NRSF by an adenovirus-expressing dominant-negative NRSF (AD/dnNRSF) increased human CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 mRNA expression, leading to aldosterone and cortisol secretion in human adrenocortical (H295R) cells. In reporter gene experiments, NRSE suppressed luciferase reporters driven by CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 promoters and dnNRSF enhanced them. Moreover, cotransfection of dnNRSF increased luciferase activity of reporter genes after deletion or mutation of NRSE, suggesting that NRSF/NRSE regulates transcription of CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 genes indirectly. AD/dnNRSF augmented mRNA expression of rat CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 genes, neither of which contains a NRSE-like sequence in rat adrenal cells. AD/dnNRSE also significantly increased CACNA1H mRNA in H295R and rat adrenal cells. Efonidipine, a T/L-type calcium channel blocker, significantly suppressed dnNRSF-mediated up-regulation of CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 expression. Moreover, NRSF/NRSE is also involved in angiotensin II- and K(+)-stimulated augmentation of CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 gene transcription. In conclusion, NRSF/NRSE controls aldosterone and cortisol synthesis by regulating CYP11B2 and CYP11B1 gene transcription mainly through NRSF/NRSE-mediated enhancement of the CACNA1H gene.", 
    "6": "Neuroleptic-induced akathisia (NIA) is a common, sometimes incapacitating adverse effect of anti-psychotic medication. Zolmitriptan is a selective 5-HT(1D) agonist. We aimed to determine its anti-NIA efficacy in comparison to propranolol. Thirty-three neuroleptic-treated patients were randomly allocated in a double-blind design to receive either 7.5 mg/d of zolmitriptan or 120 mg/d of propranolol for 3 consecutive days, followed by 3 days without any anti-NIA treatment. Patients were assessed at baseline and on days 3 and 7 by the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), PANSS, HAMD, HAMA, Pulse, and Blood Pressure. Both groups showed improvement of akathisia (BARS) along the treatment period, with significant effect for time but not for group. No significant differences were found between the groups in all other measurements. Taken together, zolmitriptan was found to be as effective as propranolol for the treatment of NIA. Further placebo-controlled studies are warranted.", 
    "7": "We studied the profiles of all-cause and cardiovascular (CVS) mortality among users of different antihypertensive classes in a Chinese population. From electronic patient records, a cohort study was conducted among 18,338 patients who ever newly prescribed an alpha-blocker, thiazide diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB) or agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) without drug discontinuation or switching in the public primary-care sector in a large Territory of Hong Kong during January 2004-June 2007. The odds ratios of mortality (all-cause and CVS) were evaluated according to the prescribed antihypertensive drug classes by Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. A total of 823 deaths (4.5%) were reported during the study period. The crude proportions of all-cause mortality were highest in alpha-blockers (6.2%) and CCB (5.7%), but lowest in beta-blockers (2.8%). Compared with CCB, patients on thiazide diuretics were shown to have statistically significantly lower all-cause (adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) 0.75, 95% CI 0.60, 0.93, P=0.010) and CVS mortality (aHR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21, 0.78, P=0.007), but the 95% CI of the odds ratios of the major drug classes overlapped. When each drug class was used as a reference group, or when patients with only uncomplicated hypertension were included, their respective 95% CI similarly overlapped. Antihypertensive drug classes were associated with statistically comparable odds of all-cause and CVS mortality. This finding from real-life clinical practice further supports the position statements from international guidelines, which recommend that the major antihypertensive drug classes are suitable for initiating pharmacotherapy for the management of hypertension.",

The granules of PPHCl were prepared by wet granulation method using a different ratios drug: gum ratios of X, LBG and XLBG(X and LBG in 1:1 ratios). To increase the flowability and compressibility of the granules, and to prevent its adhesion to punch and die, magnesium stearate and talc were added to the granules in 1:2 ratios before punching. The tablet was analysed to determine hardness, friability, % assay and invitro release study was carried out. The release of PPHCl from a gelatinous swollen mass, which controls the diffusion of drug molecules through the polymeric material into aqueous medium. The XLBG matrice shows precise controlled release than the X and LBG matrice because of burst effect and fast release in case of X and LBG matrice respectively and there was no chemical interaction between drug and polymer in XLBG formulation as confirmed by FTIR studies. First pass effect of PPHCl can be avoided by these formulations. Matrices with XLBG show zero-order release via swelling, diffusion and relaxation mechanism. The XLBG matrice leads to more precise result than X and LBG alone by the utilization of synergistic interaction between two biopolymers and uniformity in the hydration layer in dissolution media. However, according to the similarity factor (f(2)) XLBG3 were the most similar formulations to Lol-SR as the reference standard.", 
    "9": "The combination of three blood-pressure-lowering drugs at low doses, with a statin, aspirin, and folic acid (the polypill), could reduce cardiovascular events by more than 80% in healthy individuals. We examined the effect of the Polycap on blood pressure, lipids, heart rate, and urinary thromboxane B2, and assessed its tolerability.", 
    "10": "In a double-blind trial in 50 centres in India, 2053 individuals without cardiovascular disease, aged 45-80 years, and with one risk factor were randomly assigned, by a central secure website, to the Polycap (n=412) consisting of low doses of thiazide (12.5 mg), atenolol (50 mg), ramipril (5 mg), simvastatin (20 mg), and aspirin (100 mg) per day, or to eight other groups, each with about 200 individuals, of aspirin alone, simvastatin alone, hydrochlorthiazide alone, three combinations of the two blood-pressure-lowering drugs, three blood-pressure-lowering drugs alone, or three blood-pressure-lowering drugs plus aspirin. The primary outcomes were LDL for the effect of lipids, blood pressure for antihypertensive drugs, heart rate for the effects of atenolol, urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 for the antiplatelet effects of aspirin, and rates of discontinuation of drugs for safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00443794.", 
    "11": "Compared with groups not receiving blood-pressure-lowering drugs, the Polycap reduced systolic blood pressure by 7.4 mm Hg (95% CI 6.1-8.1) and diastolic blood pressure by 5.6 mm Hg (4.7-6.4), which was similar when three blood-pressure-lowering drugs were used, with or without aspirin. Reductions in blood pressure increased with the number of drugs used (2.2/1.3 mm Hg with one drug, 4.7/3.6 mm Hg with two drugs, and 6.3/4.5 mm Hg with three drugs). Polycap reduced LDL cholesterol by 0.70 mmol/L (95% CI 0.62-0.78), which was less than that with simvastatin alone (0.83 mmol/L, 0.72-0.93; p=0.04); both reductions were greater than for groups without simvastatin (p<0.0001). The reductions in heart rate with Polycap and other groups using atenolol were similar (7.0 beats per min), and both were significantly greater than that in groups without atenolol (p<0.0001). The reductions in 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 were similar with the Polycap (283.1 ng/mmol creatinine, 95% CI 229.1-337.0) compared with the three blood-pressure-lowering drugs plus aspirin (350.0 ng/mmol creatinine, 294.6-404.0), and aspirin alone (348.8 ng/mmol creatinine, 277.6-419.9) compared with groups without aspirin. Tolerability of the Polycap was similar to that of other treatments, with no evidence of increasing intolerability with increasing number of active components in one pill.",

    "13": "The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor was recently introduced to the analytical biochemical society for measuring small drug-protein interactions. However, the technique has many times been used without specifying the type of enantiomeric form of the chiral drug measured and/or with using a too narrow drug concentration range resulting in biased values of binding coefficients and sometimes even assumptions about single-site bindings although the binding in reality comprises a multisite interaction. In this study we will give guidelines for reliable experimental and methodological approaches to avoid these pitfalls. For this purpose, we also introduce a new tool, based on physical chemistry, to the sensor community; the calculation of the adsorption energy distribution (AED). The AED-calculations reveal the degree of heterogeneity directly from the SPR raw data and thus guide us into a narrower selection of probable models before the rival model fitting procedure. We demonstrate how to measure reliable equilibrium data for the two typically different cases: drug binding to (i) transport (plasma) proteins and to (ii) a target protein. Both the binding of the chiral beta-blocker propranolol to alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and that of the anticoagulant warfarin to human serum albumin were heterogeneous, with a few strong enantioselective sites and many weak nonselective sites. We also demonstrate how the multisite binding rapidly falsely turns to single-site as the concentration range is narrowed and how adding dimethyl sulfoxide to the buffer affects multisite drug-protein data. The binding of the enantiomers of the thrombin inhibitor melagatran was investigated on both thrombin and the transport proteins, revealing clear enantioselectivity for thrombin in favor of the active enantiomer, but almost similar binding properties for both enantiomers to the transport protein AGP. The AED-calculations verified that both these system has a unimodal energy distribution and are best described with a homogeneous adsorption model.", 
    "14": "Beta2-agonists have been shown to increase alveolar fluid reabsorption, and at least part of their effect depends on active sodium transport from the alveolus into the epithelial cell by the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Few data exist on their effect in the injured lung. The authors therefore investigated the effect of intrabronchially administered terbutaline pretransplantation by measuring outcome 1 day after experimental donor lung transplantation with severe injury due to prolonged ischemia. Orthotopic single left-sided lung allotransplantation was performed in female rats (Wistar to Wistar) after a total ischemic time of 20 hours. Graft PaO2/FiO2 in 6 recipients treated with 10(-4) M terbutaline in 500 microL NaCl 0.9% was superior 24 hours after transplantation, with a PaO2 of 329 (111 [SD]) mm Hg versus 5 vehicle controls with 44 (15) mm Hg (P = .002). The beneficial effect of 10(-4) M terbutaline was abrogated by 10(-4) M of the sodium channel blocker amiloride to 71 (34) mm Hg in 3 recipients (P = .028 versus terbutaline 10(-4) M). Ten recipients receiving 10(-5) M terbutaline in 500 microL NaCl 0.9% showed inconsistent improvements of gas exchange, with a PaO2 of 158 (+/- 153) mm Hg (P = .058). Terbutaline at a high dose significantly improved the transplanted rat lung function at 24 hours after transplantation. Part of it may be via activating epithelial sodium transport, thus suggesting an important role of alveolar fluid transport in such a model of acute lung injury.",

    "16": "We hypothesized that testosterone at physiological levels enhances cardiac contractile responses to stimulation of both alpha(1)- and beta(1)-adrenoceptors by increasing Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and speedier removal of Ca(2+) from cytosol via Ca(2+)-regulatory proteins. We first determined the left ventricular developed pressure, velocity of contraction and relaxation, and heart rate in perfused hearts isolated from control rats, orchiectomized rats, and orchiectomized rats without and with testosterone replacement (200 microg/100 g body wt) in the presence of norepinephrine (10(-7) M), the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (10(-6) M), or the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (10(-7) M) in the presence of 5 x 10(-7) M ICI-118,551, a beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist. Next, we determined the amplitudes of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration transients induced by electrical stimulation or caffeine, which represent, respectively, Ca(2+) release via the ryanodine receptor (RyR) or releasable Ca(2+) in the SR, in ventricular myocytes isolated from the three groups of rats. We also measured (45)Ca(2+) release via the RyR. We then determined the time to 50% decay of both transients, which represents, respectively, Ca(2+) reuptake by sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and removal via the sarcolemmal Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). We correlated Ca(2+) removal from the cytosol with activities of SERCA and its regulator phospholamban as well as NCX. The results showed that testosterone at physiological levels enhanced positive inotropic and lusitropic responses to stimulation of alpha(1)- and beta(1)-adrenoceptors via the androgen receptor. The increased contractility and speedier relaxation were associated with increased Ca(2+) release via the RyR and faster Ca(2+) removal out of the cytosol via SERCA and NCX.",

    "21": "Central (hypothalamic) control of bone mass is proposed to be mediated through beta2-adrenergic receptors (beta2-ARs). While investigations in mouse bone cells suggest that epinephrine enhances both RANKL and OPG mRNA via both beta-ARs and alpha-ARs, whether alpha-ARs are expressed in human bone cells is controversial. The current study investigated the expression of alpha1-AR and beta2-AR mRNA and protein and the functional role of adrenergic stimulation in human osteoblasts (HOBs). Expression of alpha1B- and beta2-ARs was examined by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot (for alpha1B-ARs). Proliferation in HOBs was assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation and expression of RANKL and OPG was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. RNA message for alpha1B- and beta2-ARs was expressed in HOBs and MG63 human osteosarcoma cells. alpha1B- and beta2-AR immunofluorescent localization in HOBs was shown for the first time by deconvolution microscopy. alpha1B-AR protein was identified in HOBs by Western blot. Both alpha1-agonists and propranolol (beta-blocker) increased HOB replication but fenoterol, a beta2-agonist, inhibited it. Fenoterol nearly doubled RANKL mRNA and this was inhibited by propranolol. The alpha1-agonist cirazoline increased OPG mRNA and this increase was abolished by siRNA knockdown of alpha1B-ARs in HOBs. These data indicate that both alpha1-ARs and beta2-ARs are present and functional in HOBs. In addition to beta2-ARs, alpha1-ARs in human bone cells may play a role in modulation of bone turnover by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "22": "Carvedilol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, has been shown to possess antioxidant effects and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in patients with severe congestive heart failure, which is featured by the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and leads to thrombotic complications. Thrombomodulin (TM) plays protective roles against thrombosis. Treatment of ECs with TNF-alpha resulted in a down-regulation in the TM expression in a time-dependent manner. Pre-treatment of ECs with carvedilol (1 and 10 microM) for 1 h significantly up-regulated the TM expression in ECs in response to TNF-alpha. When ECs were pre-treated with a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor, i.e., parthenolide, their TNF-alpha-mediated down-regulation of TM expression was inhibited. Pre-treatment of ECs with carvedilol inhibited the NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity in ECs induced by TNF-alpha. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which carvedilol exerts anti-thrombotic effects by inducing TM expression in ECs in response to pro-inflammatory stimulation.",

AF is associated with an increased incidence of mortality, stroke, and coronary events compared to sinus rhythm. AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be administered to reduce immediately a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nondrug therapies should be performed in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. Paroxysmal AF associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be treated with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in patients with AF and symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with ventricular pauses greater than 3 seconds which are not drug-induced. Elective DC cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than does medical cardioversion in converting AF to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography has shown no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective DC or drug cardioversion of AF and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer, especially in elderly patients , ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Patients with AF at low risk for stroke or with contraindications to warfarin should be treated with aspirin 325 mg daily.",

Human endothelial cells (EAHy-926) were incubated with vehicle, NEB 0.7 nmol/l, metoprolol 200 nmol/l, 17[beta]-estradiol (E2) 15 nmol/l, the estrogen receptor antagonists tamoxifen 100 nmol/l and ICI 182780 (ICI) 100 nmol/l, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N[omega]-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester 1 mmol/l and combinations of NEB and E2 with either tamoxifen, ICI or N[omega]-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester as well as metoprolol and ICI. Atomic force microscopy was performed to measure cellular stiffness, cell volume and apical surface. Presence of estrogen receptor protein in EAHy-926 was confirmed by western blot analysis; quantification of ER[alpha] and ER[beta] total RNA was performed by semiquantitative PCR.",

The decrease in stiffness occurred as soon as 5 min after starting NEB incubation. The effects are mediated through nongenomic ER[beta] pathways, as ER[alpha] is not translated into measurable protein levels in EAHy-926. Furthermore, NEB increased cell volume by 48 +/- 4% and apical surface by 34 +/- 3%. E2 had comparable effects. Tamoxifen, ICI and N[omega]-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester substantially diminished the effects of NEB and E2.",

    "43": "The present study was designed to examine the effects of circulating catecholamines released by sympathoadrenal system on the haemodynamics of the masseter muscle in deeply urethane-anaesthetized, artificially ventilated, cervically vagotomized and sympathectomized rats. Intravenous administration of adrenaline induced a biphasic change of blood flow in the masseter muscle (MBF). The change of blood flow showed an initial marked increase and successive slight decrease in a dose-dependent manner (0.01-1 microg/kg). The administration of noradrenaline had no significant effect on the MBF. The increase in the MBF evoked by exogenously applied adrenaline was markedly reduced by the intravenous administration of propranolol (100 microg/kg), whereas pretreatment with either hexamethonium (10 mg/kg), atropine (100 microg/kg), or phentolamine (1 mg/kg) failed to affect the MBF increase. Electrical stimulation of splanchnic nerve (SPLN) preganglionic neurones projecting to the adrenal medulla elicited frequency-dependent (1-20 Hz) increases in the MBF. The intravenous administration of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist, ICI 118551 (0.5 mg/kg), almost abolished the MBF increase induced by SPLN stimulation, but pretreatment with the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor selective antagonist, atenolol (1 mg/kg), had no effect on this response. The results of the present study indicate that circulating adrenaline elicits acute vasodilatation through a beta-adrenergic mechanism in the rat masseter muscle. Vascular beta(2)-adrenergic receptors in the masseter muscle may be activated preferentially by adrenaline released from the adrenal medulla, suggesting that the sympathoadrenal system is involved in the marked MBF increase during sympathoexcitation.",

Coronary angiography shows an ulcerated nonobstructing plaque in the left anterior descending artery. She fails to improve with standard treatment with inotrope and intraaortic balloon pump. Echocardiography revealed acquired left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction and secondary mitral regurgitation. Treatment with intravenous beta-blockers produced both clinical and hemodynamic improvement as well as resolution of LVOT obstruction. Echocardiography is essential in defining the mechanism of cardiogenic shock in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Inotropic support exacerbates cardiogenic shock due to acquired LVOT obstruction that is best treated with beta-blockers.", 
    "45": "It is necessary to note at very beginning, that up to now a comparative approach to the discussion of the structure and function of synthetic and endogenous beta-adrenergic agonists for biomedical and clinical sciences does not appear to be available in the literature. Maybe, one of the reasons for this lies in the differential relations and constant attention of investigators either to the synthetic beta-adrenergic blockers on one hand or to endogenous beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (EBARA) on the other. Therefore, the main goal of this article is to attempt to overcome this. It is clear now that there are several common properties and relevant features among synthetic beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, endogenous nonspecific beta-adrenergic antagonists (ENBARA) and relative endogenous specific beta-adrenergic antagonists (RESBARA). They are predominantly related to the reduction of adrenergic influence, namely, beta-adrenergic receptor neurotransmission, and, at an intracellular molecular level, to inhibition of adenylate cyclase and a decrease in cyclic AMP content. Other relevant and individual differences are also available and are also discussed.",

However, changes of the left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (P = .04), end-systolic dimension (P < .01), and ejection fraction on radionuclide ventriculography (P = .02) were significantly larger in autoantibody-positive patients than antibody-negative patients. Changes in the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide tended to be larger in autoantibody-positive patients (P = .09). The increase of heart rate normalized by the increase of plasma norepinephrine during exercise (an index of adrenergic responsiveness) showed a greater decrease in autoantibody-positive patients than autoantibody-negative patients (P = .035).",

Patients were more persistent on ARBs than on ACEi and CCBs, BBs and diuretics. Thus the product of blood pressure lowering and persistence was higher on ARBs than on any other drug class. Although the price per tablet of more recently developed drugs (ACEi, ARBs) is higher than that of older ones (diuretics and BBs), the newer drugs result in a more favourable cost to effect ratio when direct drug costs and indirect costs are also considered.",

This makes ARBs an attractive choice for long term treatment of hypertension.", 
    "56": "The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are pacemaking cells required for gastrointestinal motility. The possibility of whether DA-9701, a novel prokinetic agent formulated with Pharbitis Semen and Corydalis Tuber, modulates pacemaker activities in the ICC was tested using the whole cell patch clamp technique. DA-9701 produced membrane depolarization and increased tonic inward pacemaker currents in the voltage-clamp mode. The application of flufenamic acid, a non-selective cation channel blocker, but not niflumic acid, abolished the generation of pacemaker currents induced by DA-9701. Pretreatment with a Ca2+-free solution and thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor in the endoplasmic reticulum, abolished the generation of pacemaker currents. In addition, the tonic inward currents were inhibited by U-73122, an active phospholipase C inhibitor, but not by GDP-beta-S, which permanently binds G-binding proteins. Furthermore, the protein kinase C inhibitors, chelerythrine and calphostin C, did not block the DA-9701-induced pacemaker currents. These results suggest that DA-9701 might affect gastrointestinal motility by the modulation of pacemaker activity in the ICC, and the activation is associated with the non-selective cationic channels via external Ca2+ influx, phospholipase C activation, and Ca2+ release from internal storage in a G protein-independent and protein kinase C-independent manner.",

The critical parameter for differentiating between the occurrence of reentry and the mere occurrence of a line of activation block between the two myocardial regions (and no reentry) was not the magnitude of the repolarization gradient but the timing of arrival of the premature activation wave at the distal side of the line of activation block relative to the repolarization time of the premature beat proximal to the line of block.

    "62": "Cardiotoxicity is an emerging concern with a new class of drugs known as targeted agents, which include trastuzumab and sunitinib. Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple tyrosine kinase receptors. This drug was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for the treatment of clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We describe a 65-year-old woman who was treated with sunitinib for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. After 5 months of therapy, she developed acute heart failure requiring hospitalization; sunitinib was immediately discontinued. The patient had classic symptoms of heart failure, including pleural effusion. An echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30%. She received standard treatment for heart failure, including a beta-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and diuretics. Within 1 month, the patient's symptoms resolved, and subsequent cardiac evaluation showed that her left ventricular ejection fraction returned to normal. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events developed by the National Cancer Institute, her cardiac event associated with sunitinib was defined as grade III toxicity. One month later, sorafenib, another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was started with the aim of continuing her previous response to sunitinib. After 7 months of sorafenib therapy, the patient had no evidence of heart failure, and her condition was responding to treatment. Clinicians should be aware that sunitinib-induced heart failure occurs occultly and that many--but not all--cases resolve with discontinuation of the drug. Use of sorafenib after sunitinib-induced heart failure appears to be safe and effective, which suggests that cardiotoxicity is not a general class effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",

By order of frequency, the prophylactic treatments administered were topiramate (43%), beta-blockers (18%), flunaricine (17%), amitriptyline (14%), selective serotonin reputake inhibitors (6%) and others (2%). Beta-blockers and flunaricine were used much more frequently in men (29.7% and 27% versus 15.9% and 14.4%, respectively) and antidepressants were used more in women (21.87% versus 5.4%). The most frequently used antidepressant was amitriptyline, and its use increases with the age of the patient, it being the most frequently used treatment in over 60-year-old patient group.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of beta- and alpha-adrenoceptor blockade on cutaneous wound healing. Male rats were treated with propranolol (beta1- and beta2-antagonist), atenolol (beta1-antagonist), or phentolamine (alpha1- and alpha2-antagonist) dissolved in drinking water. A full-thickness excisional lesion was created and the wound area was measured. Fourteen days after wounding, lesions and adjacent skin were removed, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue, and immunostained for alpha-smooth muscle actin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Wound contraction was delayed in propranolol- and atenolol-treated animals but not in phentolamine-treated animals. Reepithelialization was decreased only in propranolol-treated animals. beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptor blockade delayed leukocyte migration, epidermal and connective tissue cell proliferation, myofibroblastic differentiation, and mast cell migration. The volume density of blood vessels was increased in the propranolol- and atenolol-treated animals compared with controls. The levels of matrix metalloproteases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) decreased in the propranolol- and atenolol-treated animals. alpha1- and alpha2-adrenoceptor blockade only affected leukocyte migration, epithelial and connective tissue cell proliferation, and pro-MMP-9 levels. In conclusion, beta-1 and beta-2, but not alpha-1 and alpha-2, adrenoceptor blockade delays cutaneous wound healing.", 
    "72": "Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias when estimating causal treatment effects using observational data. Matching on the propensity score creates sets of treated and untreated subjects who have a similar distribution of baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching frequently relies upon calipers, such that matched treated and untreated subjects must have propensity scores that lie within a specified caliper distance of each other. We define the 'marginally matched' subject as a subject who would be matched using the specified caliper width, but who would not have been matched had calipers with a narrower width been employed. Using patients hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction (or heart attack) and with exposure to a statin prescription at discharge, we demonstrate that the inclusion of marginally matched subjects can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact upon the estimated treatment effect. Furthermore, marginally matched treated subjects can differ from marginally matched untreated subjects to a substantially greater degree than the differences between non-marginally matched treated and untreated subjects in the propensity-score matched sample. The concept of the marginally matched subject can be used as a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of the matching method on the estimates of treatment effectiveness.",

About 10 min after induction of anaesthesia she had several runs of ventricular tachycardia followed by ventricular fibrillation requiring 30 s of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, after which she reverted to sinus rhythm. Review of her chest X-ray, suggested that the haemodialysis catheter (Permcath) position may have precipitated this event. However, subsequent investigation found that she had toxic serum levels of sotalol, with a prolonged corrected QT interval on the electrocardiogram. She was started on sotalol while her renal graft was functioning well but it was not reviewed when the graft started to fail and she had to commence haemodialysis. This led to the accumulation of sotalol and explains her serum sotalol value of 7.1 mg x l(-1) on the day of the event. Concentrations greater than 2.5 mg x l(-1) are generally considered toxic.",

    "89": "In modern drug discovery, 2-D similarity searching is widely employed as a cost-effective way to screen large compound collections and select subsets of molecules that may have interesting biological activity prior to experimental screening. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in applying the existing 2-D similarity searching methods to combinatorial chemistry libraries to search for novel hits or to evolve lead series. A dilemma thus arises when many identical substructures recur in library products and they have to be considered repeatedly in descriptor calculations. The dilemma is exacerbated by the astronomical number of combinatorial products. This problem imposes a major barrier to similarity searching of large combinatorial chemistry spaces. An efficient approach, termed Monomer-based Similarity Searching (MoBSS), is proposed to remedy the problem. MoBSS calculates atom pair (AP) descriptors based on interatomic topological distances, which lend themselves to pair additivity. A fast algorithm is employed in MoBSS to rapidly compute product atom pairs from those of the constituent fragments. The details of the algorithm are presented along with a series of proof-of-concept studies, which demonstrate the speed, accuracy, and utility of the MoBSS approach.", 
    "90": "We developed a technique to monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) by model-based analysis of the aortic pressure waveform. First, the aortic pressure waveform is represented with a lumped parameter circulatory model. Then, the model is fitted to each beat of the waveform to estimate its lumped parameters to within a constant scale factor equal to the arterial compliance (C (a)). Finally, the proportional parameter estimates are utilized to compute beat-to-beat absolute EF by cancelation of the C (a) scale factor. In this way, in contrast to conventional imaging, EF may be continuously monitored without any ventricular geometry assumptions. Moreover, with the proportional parameter estimates, relative changes in beat-to-beat left ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV), cardiac output (CO), and maximum left ventricular elastance (E (max)) may also be monitored. To evaluate the technique, we measured aortic pressure waveforms, reference EF and EDV via standard echocardiography, and other cardiovascular variables from six dogs during various pharmacological influences and total intravascular volume changes. Our results showed overall EF and calibrated EDV root-mean-squared-errors of 5.6% and 4.1 mL, and reliable estimation of relative E (max) and beat-to-beat CO changes. These results demonstrate, perhaps for the first time, the feasibility of estimating EF from only a blood pressure waveform.", 
    "91": "Chronic heart failure is one of the most frequent causes of death in humans. Knockout of type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC) in mice causes longevity and protection from cardiomyopathy, and an AC5 inhibitor reduces beta-adrenoceptor-stimulated Ca(2+) inward currents in isolated mouse cardiomyocytes. These data indicate that selective AC5 inhibitors may be beneficial in chronic heart failure. Therefore, we characterized AC in mouse heart membranes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis suggested that AC5 is an important heart AC isoform. Enzyme kinetics of heart AC and recombinant AC5 in the presence of Mg(2+) were similar. Moreover, the inhibitory profile of eight 2'(3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) (MANT)-nucleoside 5'-([gamma-thio])triphosphates on mouse heart in the presence of Mg(2+) was almost identical to that of AC5. MANT-ITP was the most potent inhibitor of heart AC and recombinant AC5, with K(i) values in the 15 to 25 nM range in the presence of Mg(2+) and in the 1 to 5 nM range in the presence of Mn(2+). However, in the presence of Mn(2+), we also noted differences between mouse heart AC and AC5 with respect to enzyme kinetics and forskolin analog effects. In conclusion, with regard to expression and kinetics and inhibition by MANT-nucleotides in the presence of Mg(2+), AC5 is an important AC isoform in heart, with MANT-ITP being an excellent starting point for the design of AC5-selective inhibitors. Unfortunately, a limitation of our study is the fact that immunologically and biochemically, AC5 and AC6 are quite similar, although they have different roles in heart. Moreover, lack of antibody specificity and Mn(2+) masking AC5 effects were problems.", 
    "92": "Protective effects of each cardiovascular drug on major organ functions are reviewed. Based on these effects, proper use of the drugs is presented. It is probable that norepinephrine and dobutamine have the most protective effect against major organ dysfunctions. It has been shown that perioperative beta-blocker administration reduces cardiovascular complications. Nicorandil is likely to have ischemic preconditioning properties. In case of hypotension, low doses of noradrenaline should be administered first, and then dobutamine should be added. In case of systolic dysfunction, low doses of dobutamine should be chosen first, and then noradrenaline, and finally olprinone could be added. In case of hypotension and systolic dysfunction, combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine is the first choice. Then adrenaline could be added. When ischemic heart disease exists, nicorandil should be given. When decreasing or stabilizing heart rate is required, an ultra-short acting beta-blocker, such as landiolol, is recommended. To maintain hypotension in a certain situation, prostaglandin E1 is better to use than nicardipine, diltiazem, and nitroglycerin. It is important to administer the drugs focusing on postoperative complications and outcome.",

    "117": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, alternatively known as stress cardiomyopathy, is an increasingly recognized clinical syndrome characterized by acute reversible apical ventricular dysfunction. To elucidate the mechanism, we tried to make a new model of takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy in non-human primates. Echocardiography revealed that repeated intravenous infusion of epinephrine overdose in cynomolgus monkeys induced takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy, which is characterized by progressive left ventricle and depressed systolic function with severe hypokinesis in apical regions and hyperkinesis in the basal region. Although this cardiac dysfunction almost normalized after a month even without any treatment, metoprolol, a beta-blocker, improved the decreased ejection fraction earlier than in the control. Luxol fast blue staining, which is useful for estimating myocytolysis, showed that increased myocytolysis was observed in the apical ventricle of the epinephrine-infused heart. Metoprolol diminished epinephrine-induced cardiomyocytolysis. To explain the mechanism of takotsubo myopathy and the effect of metoprolol, gene expressions in apical or basal ventricle were compared. Heart failure-related genes, such as brain natriuretic peptide, connective tissue growth factor and osteopontin; calcium signaling-related genes, such as ryanodine receptor 2, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2A2 and adenylate cyclase 7; renin-angiotensin system-related genes, such as angiotensinogen, angiotensin II receptor, type 1 and type 2; and mitochondria-related genes, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha, cytochrome c and transcription factor A mitochondrial, were significantly changed at the apical ventricle rather than at the basal ventricle. The changes of some genes improved with metoprolol treatment.

Anticoagulation therapy is recommended for all patients with acute PVT in an attempt to prevent further thrombosis and to promote recanalisation of the obstructed veins. Chronic PVT is characterised by the presence of a portal cavernoma and development of portal hypertension. Bleeding from ruptured oesophageal or gastric varices is the main complication of portal hypertension in these patients. Both endoscopic therapy and beta-adrenergic blockade are used for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding. In the absence of bleeding, continuous anticoagulant therapy should be considered for the group of chronic PVT patients in whom an underlying prothrombotic factor can be identified.

We used conventional whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate Ba(2+) currents (I(Ba)) through LTCCs in rat CSMCs enzymatically dissociated from rat cerebral arteries. Labedipinedilol-A (1, 10 microM) reversibly inhibited I(Ba) in a voltage-dependent manner without modifying the I(Ba) current-voltage relationship. The I(Ba) was also abolished by the LTCC blocker nifedipine (1 microM), but enhanced by the LTCC activator Bay K8644 (100 nM). Labedipinedilol-A shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Ba) to more negative potentials. Additionally, labedipinedilol-A had greater inhibitory activity on I(Ba) holding at -40 mV than at -80 mV. This might contribute to labedipinedilol-A's more selective effect on vascular muscles compared to cardiac muscles. The protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and norepinephrine-enhanced I(Ba) were also inhibited by labedipinedilol-A. Pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (5 microM) attenuated labedipinedilol-A-mediated I(Ba) inhibition. However, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (30 microM) had little effect on labedipinedilol-A inhibition of I(Ba).

    "142": "Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common cardiac rhythm disturbance; it usually presents with recurrent episodes of tachycardia, which often increase in frequency and severity with time. Although SVT is usually not life-threatening, many patients suffer recurrent symptoms that have a major impact on their quality of life. The uncertain and sporadic nature of episodes of tachycardia can cause considerable anxiety - many patients curtail their lifestyle as a result, and many prefer curative treatment. SVT often terminates before presentation, and episodes may be erroneously attributed to anxiety. Sudden-onset, rapid, regular palpitations characterise SVT and, in most patients, a diagnosis can be made with a high degree of certainty from patient history alone. Repeated attempts at electrocardiographic documentation of the arrhythmia may be unnecessary. Treatment of SVT may not be necessary when the episodes are infrequent and self-terminating, and produce minimal symptoms. When episodes of tachycardia occur frequently, are prolonged or are associated with symptoms that affect quality of life, catheter ablation is the first choice of treatment; it is a low-risk procedure with a high success rate. Long-term preventive pharmacotherapy is an alternative approach in some patients.",

However, there have been few studies regarding the effects of carvedilol on severe hemorrhagic shock. The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of carvedilol on severe hemorrhagic shock in rats. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 2 groups (n = 12 per group): control group, no medication; and treatment group, oral administration of carvedilol (10 mg/kg per day) for 5 days. All animals were anesthetized with i.p. pentobarbital. Severe hemorrhagic shock was induced by partial exsanguination. Eight minutes after shock, all removed blood was returned to the animal. No other treatments were administered before, during, or after shock. Hemodynamics and arterial blood gases were recorded, mortality was calculated for the 5-h observation period, and plasma cytokine concentrations were measured at 5 h after shock. The mortality rates at 5 h after cardiac arrest were 8% and 50% for control and treatment groups, respectively. The increases in base deficit and lactate concentrations were less in the control group than that in the treatment group. Moreover, the increases in TNF-alpha concentrations were less in the control group than in the treatment group.

These findings suggest that carvedilol may adversely affect recovery from severe hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "145": "Azelnidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker unlike other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, does not increase but slightly decreases heart rate (HR) in clinical settings. In the present study, the mechanism for the HR-lowering action characteristic of azelnidipine was investigated in anesthetized dogs. In the in situ perfused sinus node preparation, the negative chronotropic action of azelnidipine was almost 5 times more potent than that of amlodipine. When injected intravenously in intact anesthetized dogs, both drugs produced a long-lasting blood pressure reduction, but the action of azelnidipine developed more slowly than that of amlodipine. Azelnidipine hardly affected HR at lower doses and decreased HR at higher doses. On the other hand, amlodipine consistently induced slight tachycardia. The HR-lowering effect of azelnidipine in autonomically blocked dogs was not much different from that in intact dogs, whereas tachycardia induced by amlodipine was eliminated in autonomically blocked dogs. However, neither drug affected the HR gain of baroreceptor reflex induced by changing carotid sinus pressure. These results suggest that compared with amlodipine, azelnidipine has a greater intrinsic negative chronotropic action and induces a lower level of reflex tachycardia most probably due to a slower development of blood pressure-lowering effects and that these characteristics of azelnidipine underlies its HR-lowering effects when administered systemically.",

A total acquisition time of 380 ms per table position allowed for mild shifting of the reconstruction window within the cardiac cycle of +/- 5 %. 50 ml of contrast agent were injected at 5 ml/s followed by a 50 ml split bolus (20 % contrast). The individual start delay was determined by a test bolus scan (10 ml contrast + 50 ml saline flush at 5 ml/s). The image quality for each segment, coronary artery, and patient was determined on a 4-point scale.

As determined by participating physicians, patients had insufficient IOP control and required a medication change. They were switched to once-daily fixed-combination bimatoprost/timolol with no wash-out period. IOP was recorded at treated baseline, 4-6 weeks and 12 weeks after switching. Tolerability was measured using a 4-step scale (excellent, good, moderate, poor) and all adverse events were recorded.",

Among all patients, 32.5% had used prostaglandin analog (PGA) monotherapy, 8.7% had been using a fixed combination that included a PGA, and 6.9% had been using an adjunctive combination of a PGA and a beta-blocker. Mean treated baseline IOP (+/-SD) for all patients was 20.7 +/- 3.5 mmHg. Overall, changing medication to fixed-combination bimatoprost/timolol lowered IOP to 16.6 +/- 2.7 mmHg (p < 0.001 vs. baseline) after 4-6 weeks and to 16.1 +/- 2.6 mmHg (p < 0.001) after 12 weeks; reductions of 19.8% and 22.2%, respectively. Combined bimatoprost/timolol provided an additional IOP reduction versus baseline in most subgroups based on prior treatment. At week 12, patients who had previously used a beta-blocker achieved an additional 25.8% decrease from baseline and IOP was reduced by 22.6% in former PGA monotherapy patients. At week 12, 84.6% of all eyes reached a target pressure less than or equal to 18 mmHg.

    "166": "Skeletal muscle atrophy and decreased expression of slow fibers contribute to exercise capacity limitation in Chronic Heart Failure (CHF). Pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals worsen muscle damage. In CHF sarcomeric proteins are oxidized with reduction of muscle twitch efficiency, and VO(2)-max. Beta-blockers with anti-oxidative capacity such as carvedilol have been shown to prevent contractile protein oxidation in CHF rats. Recently a new class of beta-blockers with NO donor activity has been introduced and approved for the treatment of CHF. Since a clinical clear superiority of a beta-blocker has never been shown, we compared nebivolol, that possesses NO donor activity, with bisoprolol, looking at possible differences in skeletal muscle that may have an impact on muscle function and exercise capacity in humans. We therefore studied skeletal muscle apoptosis and wastage, sarcomeric protein composition and oxidation, and muscle efficiency.", 
    "167": "In the monocrotaline rat model of CHF we compared nebivolol a beta-blocker with vasodilative properties mediated by NO production, with bisoprolol. Nebivolol prevented protein oxidation, while bisoprolol did it only partially, as demonstrated by the oxyblot analysis (Oxy/RP values) (0.90+/-0.14 Controls.; 1.7+/-0.14 CHF; 1.1+/-0.05 bisoprolol; 0.82+/-0.17 nebivolol low; 0.62+/-0.10 nebivolol high). Only nebivolol improved twitch force production and relaxation. Nebivolol prevented fibers shift towards fast isoforms, atrophy, decreased apoptosis and sphingosine levels.", 
    "168": "Nebivolol seems better than bisoprolol in CHF by decreasing apoptosis and cytokines induced muscle wastage, preventing fibers shift and protein oxidation. Nebivolol by stimulating NO generation may have prevented protein oxidation. It could be speculated that ROS release, pro-inflammatory cytokines production and NF-kappa-B activation may play a key role. These positive changes could produce a favorable impact on exercise capacity in man.",

Preventive therapy is used to try to reduce the frequency, duration, or severity of attacks. The preventive medications with the best-documented efficacy are amitriptyline, divalproex, topiramate, and the beta-blockers. Choice is made based on a drug's proven efficacy, the physician's informed belief about medications not yet evaluated in controlled trials, the drug's adverse events, the patient's preferences and headache profile, and the presence or absence of coexisting disorders. Because comorbid medical and psychologic illnesses are prevalent in patients who have migraine, one must consider comorbidity when choosing preventive drugs. Drug therapy may be beneficial for both disorders; however, it is also a potential confounder of optimal treatment of either.",

We retrospectively reviewed values from the platelet function analyzer-100 test (Dade-Behring, Deerfield, IL) from 1 day before the procedures. The following factors were evaluated for association with aspirin drug resistance: age, sex, body mass index, and smoking history; patients with hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease/ peripheral vascular disease, or hypercholesterolemia; disease pathology (aneurysm, intracranial stenosis, or extracranial stenosis); patients taking statins, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, or antidepressants; and white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet levels.

    "181": "Phosphatidic acid (PA), the product of a PLD-mediated reaction, is a lipid second messenger that participates in various intracellular signaling events and is known to regulate a growing list of signaling proteins. We found that Bcl-2 was upregulated by PA treatment in HeLa cells. However, how PA upregulates Bcl-2 expression has not yet been studied. In this study, we tried to discover the mechanisms of Bcl-2 up-regulation by PA treatment in HeLa cells. Treatment with PA resulted in significantly increased expression of Bcl-2 in HeLa cells. Moreover, PA-induced Bcl-2 expression was blocked by mepacrine, an inhibitor of PLA2, but not by propranolol, an inhibitor of PA phospholyhydrolase (PAP). Treatment of 1,2-dipalmitoryl-sn-glycero-3- phosphate (DPPA) also increased Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that Bcl-2 expression is mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), not by arachidonic acid (AA). Thereafter, we used MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059 to investigate the relationship between ERK1/2 MAPK and PA-induced Bcl-2 expression. PA-induced Bcl-2 expression was decreased when ERK1/2 was inhibited by PD98059. The transcription factor such as STAT3 which is controlled by ERK1/2 MAPK was increased along with Bcl-2 expression when the cells were treated with PA. Furthermore, STAT3 siRNA treatments inhibited PA-induced Bcl-2 expression, suggesting that STAT3 (Ser727) is involved in PA-induced Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, these findings indicate that PA acts as an important mediator for increasing Bcl-2 expression through STAT3 (Ser727) activation via the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.", 
    "182": "Despite the longstanding appreciation of communication between the nervous and the immune systems, the nature and significance of these interactions to immunity remain enigmatic. Here, we show that 6-hydroxydopamine-mediated ablation of the mouse peripheral sympathetic nervous system increases primary CD8(+) T cell responses to viral and cellular antigens presented by direct priming or cross-priming. The sympathetic nervous system also suppresses antiviral CD4(+) T cell responses, but this is not required for suppressing CD8(+) T cell responses. Adoptive transfer experiments indicate that enhanced CD8(+) responses do not result from permanent alterations in CD8(+) T cell function in sympathectomized mice. Rather, additional findings suggest that the sympathetic nervous system tempers the capacity of antigen-presenting cells to activate na\u00efve CD8(+) T cells. We also show that antiviral CD8(+) T cell responses are enhanced by administration of a beta(2) (but not beta(1) or alpha) adrenergic antagonist. These findings demonstrate a critical role for the sympathetic nervous system in limiting CD8(+) T cell responses and indicate that CD8(+) T cell responses may be altered in patients using beta-blockers, one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs.", 
    "183": "Midthoracic spinal cord injury is associated with ventricular arrhythmias that are mediated, in part, by enhanced cardiac sympathetic activity. Furthermore, it is well known that sympathetic neurons have a lifelong requirement for nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is a neurotrophin that supports the survival and differentiation of sympathetic neurons and enhances target innervation. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that paraplegia is associated with an increased cardiac NGF content, sympathetic tonus, and susceptibility to ischemia-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Intact and paraplegic (6-9 wk posttransection, T(5) spinal cord transection) rats were instrumented with a radiotelemetry device for recording arterial pressure, temperature, and ECG, and a snare was placed around the left main coronary artery. Following recovery, the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias (coronary artery occlusion) was determined in intact and paraplegic rats. In additional groups of matched intact and paraplegic rats, cardiac nerve growth factor content (ELISA) and cardiac sympathetic tonus were determined. Paraplegia, compared with intact, increased cardiac nerve growth factor content (2,146 +/- 286 vs. 180 +/- 36 pg/ml, P < 0.05) and cardiac sympathetic tonus (154 +/- 4 vs. 68 +/- 4 beats/min, P < 0.05) and decreased the ventricular arrhythmia threshold (3.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.9 +/- 0.2 min, P < 0.05). Thus altered autonomic behavior increases the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias in paraplegic rats.",

The method relies on the extraction with acetonitrile followed by centrifugation. After evaporation of acetonitrile, the residue was reconstituted in a mobile phase and filtrated. The separation of analytes was performed on a C18 column using a mobile phase of acetonitrile and ammonium formate buffer (0.05 M, pH 4.5) with gradient elution. The electrospray ionization was used to obtain the protonated molecules [M+H](+) and two product ions were monitored for each compound. For quantification deutered internal standards were used. The whole method has been validated according to the European Union requirements. Specificity, decision limit (CCalpha), detection capability (CCbeta), trueness and precision were determined. The results showed good trueness ranged from 73.2% to 110.6% with a good R.S.D., less than 13.0% under within-laboratory reproducibility conditions. The calculated critical concentrations of CCalpha for phenothiazines were between 5.8 and 6.6 microgkg(-1) while for azaperone CCalpha was 105.5 microgkg(-1) and for azaperol was 121.4 microgkg(-1). CCalpha for carazolol was 16.7 microgkg(-1) in bovine and 21.9 microgkg(-1) in porcine kidney. CCbeta for phenothiazines were between 6.3 and 7.6 microgkg(-1), for azaperone was 119.0 microgkg(-1) and for azaperol was 140.0 microgkg(-1). For carazolol in bovine kidney CCbeta was 18.6 microgkg(-1) whereas in porcine kidney was 24.4 microgkg(-1).", 
    "185": "The alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) is capable of rapid plasticity, increased by chronic exposure to positive GABA modulators, such as the neurosteroid 3alpha-OH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one (THP). Here, we show that 48 h exposure of differentiated neuroblastoma cells (IMR-32) to 100 nM THP increases alpha4 expression, without changing the current density or the concentration-response curve. Increased expression of alpha4-containing GABAR was verified by a relative insensitivity of GABA (EC(20))-gated current to modulation by the benzodiazepine (BZ) lorazepam (0.01-100 microM), and potentiation of current by flumazenil and RO15-4513, characteristic of alpha4betagamma2 pharmacology. In contrast to THP, compounds which decrease GABA-gated current, such as the BZ inverse agonist DMCM, the GABAR antagonist gabazine and the open channel blocker penicillin, decreased alpha4 expression after a 48 h exposure, without changing BZ responsiveness. However, pentobarbital, another positive GABA modulator, increased alpha4 expression, while the BZ antagonist flumazenil had no effect. In order to test whether changes in current were responsible for increased alpha4 expression, decreases in the Cl(-) driving force were produced by chronic exposure to the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide (10 microM). When applied under these conditions of reduced GABA-gated current, THP failed to increase alpha4 expression. The results of this study suggest that alpha4 expression is correlated with changes in GABA-gated current, rather than simply through ligand-receptor interactions. These findings have relevance for GABAR subunit plasticity produced by fluctuations in endogenous steroids across the menstrual cycle, when altered BZ sensitivity is reported.",

Secondary analyses exploring a continuous relationship between impaired HRR and AF, and exploring interactions between cardiac medication use, HRR, and AF were also conducted.",

In addition, there was a linear trend between impaired HRR and AF (HR 1.05 for each decreasing BPM in HRR, 95% CI 0.99, 1.11). No interactions between cardiac medications, HRR, and AF were noted.", 
    "189": "Patients with impaired HRR on ETT were more likely to develop new-onset AF, as compared to patients with normal HRR.

At currently, thrombolysis is accepted as standard therapy when PCI is not immediately available. However, PCI is often performed in stable patients with AMI who are/are not received thrombolysis . We performed the trial that enrolled myocardial infarction patients treated with thrombolysis, late PCI and medically to assess the potential benefits of delayed PCI. We follow up 164 consecutive patients after AMI one year. The patients are divided in two groups; first group-66 patients who received reperfusion (37 patients received only thrombolysis, 10 patients received thrombolysis and PCI 7-9 days after thrombolysis and 19 patients underwent only PCI after 7-9 days) and second group-98 patients medically treated. One year mortality was 3% in the reperfusion group (2/66) and 14,3% in the medical group (14/98) (p=0,016). There were not significant differences between groups about other end points-reinfarctus, coronary artery bypass surgery and PCI performed later after discharge. The major predictors of one year mortality were ages (p<0,001) and ejection fraction (p=0,003). Also, therapy with beta-blockers (p=0,002), statins (p=0,001) and ACE-inhibitors (p=0,024) was associated with better survival.

Eight SNPs of CYP2D6 were investigated in 73 subjects by a SNPstream genotyping system. The relationship between the effects of timolol and CYP2D6 Arg296Cys and Ser486Thr genotype distribution in these POAG subjects was analyzed.",

Individual effect of HR varied between -31 and 10 beats per minute, in the present study. According to SNP genotyping in 73 subjects, there was no significant difference of IOP between subjects with different CYP2D6 Arg296Cys (P = 0.308) or Ser486Thr genotypes (P = 0.741). The effect of timolol on HR was significantly different between subjects with different Arg296Cys genotypes (P = 0.046).

Subjects with CC genotype trended to avoid timolol-induced bradycardia, and subjects with TT genotype trended to have poorer timolol-induced ocular hypotensive effects.", 
    "195": "Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an inflammatory mediator widely known to exert relevant pathophysiological functions. However, the relevance of PAF in nociception has received much less attention. Herein, we have investigated the mechanisms underlying PAF-induced spontaneous nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity in the rat paw. PAF injection (1- 30 nmol/paw) resulted in a dose-related overt nociception, whilst only the dose of 10 nmol/ paw produced a significant and time-related mechanical hypersensitivity. Local coinjection of PAF antagonist WEB2086 significantly inhibited both spontaneous nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity. Moreover, the coinjection of the natural IL-1beta receptor antagonist (IRA) notably prevented both PAF-induced nociceptive responses, whilst these responses were not altered by anti-TNFalpha coinjection. Interestingly, pretreatment with the ultrapotent vaniloid agonist resiniferotoxin, coinjection of the TRPV1 receptor antagonist SB366791, or mast cell depletion with compound 48/80 markedly prevented PAF-induced spontaneous nociception. Conversely, PAF-elicited mechanical hypersensitivity was strikingly susceptible to distinct antineutrophil-related strategies, namely the antineutrophil antibody, the selectin blocker fucoidin, the chemokine CXCR2 receptor antagonist SB225002, and the C5a receptor antibody anti-CD88. Notably, the same antineutrophil migration strategies significantly prevented the increase of myeloperoxidase activity induced by PAF. The mechanical hypersensitivity caused by PAF was also prevented by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin or celecoxib, and by the selective beta(1) adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol. Collectively, the present results provide consistent evidence indicating that distinct mechanisms are involved in the spontaneous nociception and mechanical hypersensitivity caused by PAF. They also support the concept that selective PAF receptor antagonists might constitute interesting targets for the development of new analgesic drugs."
