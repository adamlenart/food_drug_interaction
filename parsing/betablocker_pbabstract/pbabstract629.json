    "0": "The authors have previously shown that 40% of patients whose ventricular arrhythmias respond to propranolol require plasma concentrations in excess of those producing substantial beta-receptor blockade (greater than 150 ng/ml). However, the electrophysiologic actions of propranolol have only been examined in human beings after small intravenous doses achieving concentrations of less than 100 ng/ml. In this study, the electrophysiologic effects of a wider concentration range of propranolol was examined in nine patients. Using a series of loading and maintenance infusions, measurements were made at baseline, at low mean plasma propranolol concentrations (104 +/- 17 ng/ml) and at high concentrations (472 +/- 68 ng/ml). Significant (p less than 0.05) increases in AH interval and sinus cycle length were seen at low concentrations of propranolol, with no further prolongation at the high concentrations; these effects are typical of those produced by beta-blockade. However, progressive shortening of the endocardial monophasic action potential duration and QTc interval were seen over the entire concentration range tested (p less than 0.05). At high concentrations, there was significant (p less than 0.05) further shortening of both the QTc and monophasic action potential duration beyond that seen at low propranolol concentrations, along with a progressive increase in the ratio of the ventricular effective refractory period to monophasic action potential duration. No significant changes were seen in HV interval, QRS duration or ventricular effective refractory period. In summary, the concentration-response relations for atrioventricular conductivity and sinus node automaticity were flat above concentrations of 150 ng/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The effect of adenosine on intraparenchymal cerebral blood flow was examined in conscious rabbits with the 133Xe clearance technique. Perivascular application of 10(-3) and 10(-4) M adenosine to hypothalamic blood vessels increased hypothalamic blood flow by approximately 50% (p less than 0.005). This vasodilatation was attenuated by the intrahypothalamic injection of the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, but was unaffected by alpha-adrenoreceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine, or depression of neuronal activity with barbiturate. 2-Chloroadenosine, a stable analogue of adenosine, also increased hypothalamic blood flow by 50% (p less than 0.005), but this dilatation was unaffected by propranolol. These results suggest that adenosine increased hypothalamic blood flow at high concentrations by vascular receptor systems dependent on adenosine receptors and adrenergic receptors. Adenosine (10(-6) M) reduced hypothalamic blood flow by approximately 25% (p less than 0.005). This vasoconstriction was unaffected by adrenergic blockade with propranolol or phenoxybenzamine, or by inhibition of neuronal activity with barbiturate. The results suggest that adenosine decreases hypothalamic blood flow at low concentrations by stimulation of adenosine receptors associated with vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "2": "A group of 29 hypertensive patients were studied for side effects of acebutolol. An antinuclear antibody titre of >/=1/64 developed in 23 per cent of patients during a 12-month course of treatment. Full ophthalmic examination before and after the treatment period showed a statistically significant increase in tear secretion at one year. One patient had a slight worsening of her psoriasis. No patients developed any symptoms or signs of oculomucocutaneous syndrome (OMCS) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).", 
    "3": "Salivary flow and the influence of drugs on this variable were studied in subjects with borderline hypertension and in normotensive control subjects. Saliva production under resting conditions was 0.85 +/- 0.08 g/min in normotensive subjects and 0.51 +/- 0.04 g/min in borderline hypertensive subjects. In both groups of subjects studied, salivary secretion was decreased by atropine but propranolol and phentolamine had no effect. The stimulating effect of neostigmine on saliva production was more pronounced in normotensive than in borderline hypertensive subjects. Thus, in order to increase salivary flow by 1 g/min 28 +/- 0.9 micrograms/min neostigmine had to be infused intravenously in normotensives compared with 41 +/- 3.8 micrograms/min in borderline hypertensives. The results of the study suggest that subjects with borderline hypertension have a reduced parasympathetic drive to the salivary glands.", 
    "4": "The urinary excretion of prostaglandins (PG) E2 and F2 alpha was measured by radioimmunoassay in 15 patients with essential hypertension, before and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment with the selective beta 1-adrenergic blocker, atenolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and plasma renin activity decreased significantly during the treatment. No change was observed in renal function and electrolyte balance. The 24-hour excretion of PGE2 and PGF2 alpha was also unaffected by the antihypertensive treatment. The above findings, in contrast with those previously observed with another beta-blocker, propranolol, suggest that tubular beta-receptors are not involved in the synthesis of PGs. The different hemodynamic effects of the two drugs are the most likely explanation for the different responses in prostaglandin excretion.", 
    "5": "Contraction of the rat isolated diaphragm in response to maximal tetanic stimulation was examined before and after isoprenaline or propranolol. Isoprenaline (10(-4)M) did not affect maximum isometric force, whereas propranolol depressed maximum force in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-6)-10(-4)M). Inhibition due to propranolol (10(-4)M) could not be overcome by increasing the intensity or duration of electrical stimulation, and was only partially reversed (mean 73% +/- 10 s.e. mean) after washing. Pretreatment with isoprenaline did not alter the response of the muscle to propranolol, nor did neuromuscular blockade with (+)-tubocurarine. The response to either stereoisomer of propranolol was similar to that obtained with the racemate. Atenolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent without membrane stabilizing activity, had minimal (less than 10%) depressant effects on diaphragmatic force development. Lignocaine (8.5 X 10(-6)-8.5 X 10(-5)M) produced a concentration-related decrease in isometric force, similar to that with propranolol. It is concluded that propranolol decreases the contractile force of the rat isolated diaphragm by a mechanism related to stabilization of excitable membranes.", 
    "6": "Hydralazine, labetalol, methyldopa, minoxidil, prazosin and placebo were compared when added to atenolol 100 mg and bendrofluazide 5 mg daily in hypertensive patients inadequately controlled by the beta-blocker/diuretic combination. Atenolol was withdrawn in those allocated to labetalol and minoxidil was given only to men. The order of acceptability was: placebo, hydralazine, prazosin, methyldopa, minoxidil, labetalol. All the active agents were more effective than placebo. Minoxidil was more effective than the other active drugs, which had similar potency to one another. Hydralazine was the most generally suitable third drug, with prazosin a close second. Minoxidil was effective in the milder hypertensives, but in the present regimen caused fluid retention in those with more severe hypertension. Labetalol probably should be introduced at lower dose (150 mg daily) even as replacement for full doses of a previously administered beta-blocker.", 
    "7": "Insulin action was assessed in 5 cytoplasmic islet cell antibody (ICA) positive non-diabetics, 8 ICA positive (type I) non-insulin-treated diabetics, 7 ICA negative insulin-treated diabetics by measurement of steady state plasma glucose (SSPG) levels during a combined intravenous infusion of propranolol, adrenaline, glucose and insulin. SPPG values of ICA positive and negative non-diabetics were similar and their combined value (4.0 +/- 0.5 mmol/l) was significantly lower (p less than 0.01 and less than 0.01) than those (11.5 +/- 1.9 and 11.3 +/- 2.2 mmol/l) of ICA positive and negative diabetics, indicating that both groups of diabetics were similarly insulin resistant. Similar correlations were observed between SSPG and HbA1 levels when considering all ICA positive subjects (r = 0.89, p less than 0.001) and all ICA negative subjects (r = 0.73, p less than 0.01). Conventional insulin treatment (2.6 months) in 4 ICA positive diabetics improved insulin action in each case with a reduction in mean SSPG concentration from 14.0 +/- 2.3 to 8.5 +/- 3.4 mmol/l. Thus, ICA positive and negative diabetics, of equivalent degree of carbohydrate intolerance, are equally insulin resistant. Insulin treatment may improve, but appears not to normalise, insulin action in ICA positive (type I) diabetics.", 
    "8": "Twenty-four patients received either propranolol, lidoflazine (Clinium), or propranolol/lidoflazine combinations in a study designed to evaluate the effect of these drugs in angina pectoris. Five patients developed ventricular tachycardia when receiving either lidoflazine or lidoflazine and propranolol in combination; one of these patients died. In addition, one patient died suddenly while being treated with propranolol alone. Lidoflazine therapy was associated with a significant prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Lidoflazine either alone or in combination with propranolol, appears to induce ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "9": "Timolol maleate produced no significant difference in the initial mean intraocular pressure after keratoplasty using disparate-sized grafts (7.5 mm recipient, 8.0 mm donor). However, timolol did significantly reduce the number of eyes with an intraocular pressure elevation greater than 24 mm Hg. A series of patients with equal-sized donor and recipient cuts (8.0 mm) had initial intraocular pressure of 19.6 mm Hg. The normal intraocular pressure in these patients is thought to be due to superficial suturing, thereby preventing angle distortion.", 
    "10": "Nadolol (N) titrated from 80 to 240 mg or bendroflumethiazide (B) 5 to 10 mg, or the combination (B + N), were randomly assigned double-blind to 365 men with pretreatment diastolic blood pressures (BP) of 95 to 114 mm Hg. After 12 weeks of treatment, a diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg was achieved in 49% who received N, 46% who received B and 85% who received B + N. With N, the diastolic BP decreased more in whites than in blacks; with B, this racial trend was reversed. Side effects were infrequent; the most common were impotence, lethargy, weakness and postural dizziness, which occurred more often with B than with N. Addition of hydralazine, 25 to 100 mg twice daily, controlled diastolic BP at a level of less than 90 mm Hg in approximately 60% of those previously uncontrolled. N, and especially B + N, provided an efficacious once-daily treatment for systemic hypertension, and addition of hydralazine was effective in most nonresponders.", 
    "11": "The clinical outcome after the initial year of therapy with either diltiazem (D), nifedipine (N), or verapamil (V) was examined in 45 patients with rest angina. Age, frequency of angina, duration of symptoms, and ejection fraction were similar in all three treatment groups. Coronary artery disease was present in 60% of patients (5 of 13 given D, 8 of 16 given N, and 14 of 16 given V). Coronary spasm was suspected (ST elevation with angina) or documented (angiographically) in 35 (78%) patients. Twenty-nine (64%) patients had greater than 50% decrease in angina without a coronary event (9 taking D, 11 taking N, and 9 taking V). Coronary events (sudden death, infarction, and hospitalization for unacceptable angina control or bypass surgery) occurred in 13 (29%) patients (two taking D, four taking N, and seven taking V). To achieve these responses, 20 (44%) patients required additional antianginal drugs (long-acting nitrates, beta blockers, or other calcium blockers). Four of these 20 patients were taking D, nine were taking N, and seven were taking V. Seventeen (38%) patients experienced a side effect (none taking D, 6 taking N, and 11 taking V). Although rest angina can be controlled in the majority of patients during the initial year of treatment with calcium blockers, additional therapy is often required. Furthermore, the clinical course of patients presenting with rest angina remains unpredictable, even during calcium blocker treatment. Morbid events continue to occur, related in part to the extent of coronary artery disease.", 
    "12": "Propranolol (240 mg daily) and verapamil (360 mg daily) were objectively compared for their respective efficacy in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Twenty-two patients were studied in a randomized placebo controlled, double-blind crossover trial with 4 weeks on each active drug treatment. Multistage treadmill exercise with computer-assisted ECG analysis was performed after 2 weeks on placebo and at the end of each 4-week active drug treatment. The mean exercise time to produce angina was 5.5 minutes (SEM +/- 0.4 minutes) on placebo and this increased to 7.8 (+/- 0.5) minutes on propranolol and 9.1 (+/- 0.5) minutes on verapamil. The improvement in exercise time of verapamil over propranolol was statistically significant (p less than 0.01). Ten patients became free of angina with verapamil and four with propranolol. Resting and maximal exercise heart rates were significantly reduced by propranolol; verapamil did not reduce the maximal heart rate but reduced the resting heart rate slightly. However, the heart rate increase per minute of exercise was significantly diminished (p less than 0.001). ST segment changes showed improvement with both drugs despite marked differences in heart rate profile. The overall efficacy of the slow calcium channel blocker, verapamil, compares favorably with that of a standard beta-adrenoreceptor blocking drug (propranolol), thus providing a new perspective in the management of angina pectoris. These two classes of drugs seem to act by different mechanisms and it is suggested that if patients are resistant or intolerant to one of these drugs, the other can be used to yield a beneficial response.", 
    "13": "Propranolol, a cationic amphiphilic drug, caused enhanced incorporation of labeled precursor into phosphatidic acid and its metabolites in rat cerebral cortex mince, suggesting increased biosynthesis or reduced degradation. Inhibition of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase could explain the observed drug-induced accumulation of phosphatidic acid and other acidic lipids. Propranolol exhibited differential effects on the free and membrane-bound forms of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. The drug inhibited cytoplasmic enzyme in a dose-dependent manner only when membrane-bound substrate was used but had practically no effect on the membrane-bound enzyme irrespective of the nature of the substrate used or on the cytoplasmic enzyme when free substrate was used. Brain cytoplasmic enzyme obtained from rats sacrificed 30 min after intraperitoneal injections of propranolol did not show any inhibition. propranolol bound to membranes may prevent cytoplasmic enzyme action, probably by decreasing the availability of substrate through the formation of stable lipid-drug-protein complexes.", 
    "14": "Timolol is now widely used in the treatment of glaucoma but its mechanism of action is unclear. The drug decreases aqueous humor formation by the ciliary processes and is a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist. However, the physiological basis for such a drug to decrease intraocular pressure has not been clearly demonstrated.", 
    "15": "The binding of tritium labelled radioligand dihydroalprenolol was investigated on live polymorphonuclear leukocytes of 6 endurance trained (VO2 max. 65.7 +/- 2.0 ml/kg . min), and 9 non-endurance trained subjects (VO2 max. 52.0 +/- 4.0 ml/kg . min). The specific binding of dihydroalprenolol is seen as an indicator of the beta-receptor density. The specific binding of dihydroalprenolol is defined as the difference between the total binding and that amount of dihydroalprenolol that could not be displaced. The leukocytes were reincubated for the binding studies in their autologous plasma. The specific binding of dihydroalprenolol on live polymorphonuclear leukocytes shows a levelling off behaviour at a concentration of approximately 2 nmol/l dihydroalprenolol in trained as well as in untrained subjects. The specific binding amounts to about 85% (0.1 nmol/l dihydroalprenolol) to 51% (2.0 nmol/l dihydroalprenolol) of the total binding. Based on Scatchard analysis, Bmax was determined as 41.2 fmol/10(7) cells (trained subjects) and 21.6 fmol/10(7) cells (untrained subjects). KD is 0.44 nmol/l dihydroalprenolol (untrained subjects), and 0.49 nmol/l dihydroalprenolol (trained subjects). The beta-adrenergic binding sites are approximately 1300 (untrained subjects), and 2500 binding sites/cell (trained subjects). The specific binding of dihydroalprenolol on live polymorphonuclear leukocytes is significantly higher in trained than in untrained subjects. This training dependent change in beta-receptor density may be an indicator of an increased sensitivity to catecholamines.", 
    "16": "The aim of the present experiments was to study the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the responses to postganglionic stimulation of two models of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system: the isolated nictitating membrane of the cat and the guinea-pig isolated atria. In the nictitating membrane of the cat, 5-HT (0.1 microM) shifted to the left the frequency-response curve to nerve stimulation. This potentiating effect was prevented by 5-HT receptor antagonists (0.1 microM methysergide, 0.1 microM pizotifen and 0.1 microM morphine) and also by the beta-adrenoreceptor blocker propranolol (0.1 microM). The alpha 2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.1 microM) had no effect on the 5-HT-induced potentiation. In the guinea-pig isolated atria the responses to cardioaccelerans nerve stimulation were diminished by 5-HT (0.1 to 1.0 microM). The shift to the right in the frequency-response curve induced by 5-HT (1.0 microM) was additive to the antagonism caused in the atria by propranolol (0.1 microM). The inhibitory effect of 5-HT on the pacemaker responses to nerve stimulation was prevented by the 5-HT receptor antagonists methysergide (1.0 microM) and pizotifen (1.0 microM) and also by the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist phentolamine (0.1 microM). The selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (0.01 microM) reduced to the same extent as 5-HT (1.0 microM) the responses to the guinea-pig atria to nerve stimulation. The inhibitory effect of clonidine was prevented by the alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker phentolamine (0.1 microM) but not by the 5-HT receptor blocker pizotifen (1.0 microM). With the exception of propranolol, which in the atria shifted to the right the concentration-response curve to exogenous noradrenaline (NA), neither 5-HT nor the different antagonists employed modified the sensitivity to NA in the tissues studied. The present observations show that 5-HT can produce a dual effect on the sympathetic neurotransmission. It is proposed that a modification in the overflow of NA in response to nerve stimulation is caused by 5-HT and results from the interaction of 5-HT with specific receptors located on the sympathetic fibres. These presynaptic 5-HT receptors behave as excitatory (cat nictitating membrane) or inhibitory (guinea-pig atria) depending on the tissue studied.", 
    "17": "Triiodothyronamine (Triam) is a potential metabolite of triidothyronine (T3), resulting from decarboxylation of the side-chain. In an attempt to elucidate the physiological properties of Triam we have investigated the binding of Triam to beta-adrenergic receptors, using turkey-erythrocytes and performing binding studies with ( (-)(3H)-dihydroalprenolol) ( (-)(3H)-DHA) as a specific beta-adrenergic ligand. The inhibition constant Ki for Triam was determined as 5 X 10(-6) M, compared to dopamine (Ki = 1,3 X 10(-2) M), norepinephrine (Ki = 3 X 10(-4) M), epinephrine (Ki = 5 X 10(-5) M) and isoproterenol (Ki = 3 X 10(-6) M). The inhibition of ( (-)(3H)-DHA)-binding by Triam was further compared with other iodothyronines thyroxine (T4), T3, 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (rT3) and 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-T2). It is concluded that Triam binds to beta-adrenergic receptors like naturally occurring amines but different from typical circulating iodothyronines.", 
    "18": "We have examined alpha 2-adrenergic [( 3H]-clonidine) and beta-adrenergic [( 3H]-dihydroalprenolol; DHA) binding in brain membranes from four different dystrophic mouse mutants: 129/ReJ-dy; 129 B6F1/J-dy; C57BL/6J-dy and C57BL/6J-dy2J. As shown previously, male 129/ReJ-dy mice have significantly fewer brain [3H]-DHA binding sites than their littermate controls. In marked contrast, the remaining three mutants showed no differences in [3H]-DHA binding when compared to their respective controls although there were inter-strain differences, e.g., C57BL/6J-dy2J mice have significantly fewer binding sites than the 129B6F1/J-dy mice. On the other hand, we saw no strain differences in alpha 2-binding. In one mutant, however, (129 B6F1/J-dy) we observed a 50% increase in alpha 2-binding sites compared to littermate controls. We conclude that weight loss or undernutrition may be an important factor in determining brain levels of adrenergic binding sites in dystrophic mouse brain.", 
    "19": "The relationship between rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (REMD) and rat beta-adrenergic receptors was evaluated. REMD was achieved using the platform method and verified by EEG and EMG recordings. Although the amount of REM sleep was diminished 90%, there was no alteration in either the number of binding sites or their affinity for [3H]-dihydroalprenolol. Periods of stress as well as recovery periods after REMD were also without effect on the cortical beta-adrenergic receptors. Thus no support is garnered for the interaction of REMD and the cortical beta-adrenergic receptor binding parameters, although REMD is sometimes used as a mode of therapy for depression and other antidepressives do in fact affect the beta-adrenergic system. The mechanism of REMD as a potential antidepressive therapy is yet to be elucidated.", 
    "20": "Using isoprenaline and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) induced tachycardia we have compared the rebound beta-adrenoceptor hypersensitivity on stopping slow-release and conventional oxprenolol in young normotensive subjects. Heart rate on standing with GTN rose after stopping slow-release and conventional oxprenolol to peak levels on day 2 or 3 significantly greater than corresponding control levels off treatment on day 5. The isoprenaline CD25 (the dose required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min) fell after stopping conventional oxprenolol to a significantly lower level on day 3 than the control level off treatment on day 5. Contrary to a recent report describing no rebound beta-adrenoceptor hypersensitivity on stopping slow-release oxprenolol we have demonstrated it after stopping slow release as well as conventional oxprenolol.", 
    "21": "In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that 1) different species have different myocardial adrenergic receptor numbers and 2) selected \"slow-channel\" calcium antagonists compete with alpha-adrenergic antagonists for binding to varying degrees in different species. The data obtained in the present study demonstrate that there is a markedly decreased number of alpha 1-adrenergic and increased number of beta-adrenergic receptors in canine compared with rabbit and rat myocardium. The differences in adrenergic receptor numbers exist without major differences in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor affinity in the species studied. There was no significant difference in left ventricular or plasma catecholamine content between the rat and dog. Selected slow-channel calcium antagonists compete for alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding in rabbit, rat, and canine myocardium. However, only in rabbit myocardium does verapamil antagonize alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding at moderate concentrations, whereas verapamil in canine and rat myocardium and 1) 600 in all three species antagonize alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding only at relatively high concentrations. Nifedipine, a dihydropyridine-type slow-channel calcium antagonist, had no effect on prazosin binding to rat, rabbit, and dog myocardial membranes.", 
    "22": "We compared the effects of calcium entry blockers on myogenic tone with the effects of these compounds on agonist- and depolarization-induced mechanical responses in isolated rings of the rabbit facial vein. The development of intrinsic tone in response to distension of the vessel wall and its potentiation by increasing the ambient temperature were antagonized by MnCl2 (0.5 mM) but not verapamil, diltiazem, or nifedipine. Similarly, the contractile response to histamine was blocked by MnCl2 but was unaffected by moderate concentrations of the organic calcium entry blockers. The histamine contractile response elicited at 34 degrees C (a condition which abolishes intrinsic tone) was also refractory to verapamil (10(-6) M). Verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine antagonized the contractile response to calcium in depolarized facial vein rings. Thus both extrinsic and intrinsic contractile responses in the rabbit facial vein depend on an extracellular source of calcium. The distension-operated channels are unique in exhibiting a marked temperature sensitivity. However, receptor- and distension-operated calcium channels can be distinguished from the voltage-operated channels in their insensitivity to the organic calcium entry blockers.", 
    "23": "Oxygen consumption is markedly elevated in rats with lesions of the lateral hypothalamus (LH), a response typically associated with hyperactivity. To test for involvement of adrenergic systems in this hypermetabolic state, propranolol was administered before and immediately after LH lesions. Propranolol attenuated both the lesion-induced rise in oxygen consumption and activity in the 12 h after surgery. A second experiment evaluated the contribution of activity to this thermic response by lesioning rats immobilized by a continuous barbiturate infusion. The persistence of lesion-induced increases in oxygen consumption in the absence of activity and the attenuation of this response by propranolol demonstrated that 1) LH lesions directly alter metabolic heat production, and 2) this effect is at least partly mediated by beta-adrenergic systems. The functional significance of increased energy expenditure after LH lesions is discussed in light of the known effects of this lesion on the level of regulated body weight.", 
    "24": "Interaction of the insecticide 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane (DDT) with beta-receptor binding and adenylate cyclase activity of biological membranes has been studied. Following exposure of cultured Chang liver cells to DDT, maximal binding of the catecholamine antagonist [125I]-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (HYP) to isolated cell membranes was decreased by 30% whereas the dissociation constant remained unchanged. Both basal activity and maximal isoproterenol-stimulated activity of adenylate cyclase were not altered. The isoproterenol concentration required for half-maximal stimulation of the enzyme was increased about 2-fold as was the agonist concentration required for half-maximal displacement of the antagonist HYP at the beta-receptor binding site. Thus, coupling efficiency of hormone-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was not influenced by the presence of DDT in these membranes. The data show that interaction of DDT with the beta-receptor adenylate cyclase complex is restricted to the receptor component. Enzyme activity is directly linked to changes of agonist binding at the beta-receptor. Interference of DDT with signal transduction via 'fluidization' of membrane lipids has not been detected.", 
    "25": "With the use of equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography the effects on left ventricular (LV) function of 160 mg oral propranolol daily and 360 mg verapamil daily alone and in combination were compared in 18 patients with chronic exertional angina. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover protocol was used. The reduction in exercise rate-pressure product induced by the combination (118 +/- 28 mm Hg/min) was significantly greater (p less than .05) than that by propranolol (135 +/- 27 mm Hg/min) or verapamil alone (163 +/- 28 mm Hg/min). In patients at rest, neither single nor combined therapy altered global or regional left ventricular ejection fractions (EFs). Verapamil, but not propranolol, increased (p less than .05) cardiac volumes of resting subjects; used in combination, no further increase in LV volume occurred. With placebo, exercise global EF did not decrease from the level at rest and therefore no drug effect could be demonstrated for this parameter of LV function. By an evaluation of normalized regional EF measurements the combination was shown to reduce exercise-induced hypokinesis (placebo 52 +/- 20%, combination 61 +/- 23%; p less than .01). No significant improvement was noted with propranolol or verapamil alone; only the combination prevented a significant increase in end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes during exercise. Thus, propranolol and verapamil, used alone in moderate doses, exert no beneficial effect on exercise LV function as measured by EF and volume changes, and resting function deteriorates slightly with verapamil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Neurotensin in picomolar concentrations caused a concentration-related inhibition of the spontaneous contractile activity of the longitudinal muscle from the rabbit isolated ileum. Neurotensin was approximately 100 times more potent than adrenaline and about 10000 times as active as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in producing similar relaxations. The neurotensin-induced inhibitory effect did not follow activation of adrenoceptors or P1-purinoceptors since the effect of the neuropeptide was not antagonized by a combination of phentolamine plus (-)-propranolol, nor by pretreatment with theophylline. Tetrodotoxin did not reduce the potency of neurotensin in relaxing the rabbit ileum, suggesting that the neurotensin-induced inhibition is not neuronally mediated. The inhibitory responses of neurotensin were blocked non-competitively by apamin. The inhibitory effect of neurotensin was short-lived with the subsequent development of tachyphylaxis, which was not crossed to the inhibitory action of adrenaline or ATP. Similarly, when tachyphylaxis to adrenaline or to ATP was established, the inhibitory action of neurotensin was unaffected. Desensitization was characterized by a gradual shift of the neuropeptide concentration-response curve to the right and downwards. Preincubation of rabbit ileum strips with 10 nM dynorphin (1-13) significantly increased the inhibitory action of neurotensin.", 
    "27": "Isoprenaline 3.5-35 ng/kg/min, salbutamol 17.5-175 ng/kg/min and prenalterol 1-32 micrograms/kg were given intravenously (i.v.) to 10, 12 and nine subjects with borderline hypertension respectively. For a given chronotropic effect the effects on plasma noradrenaline were in the order: salbutamol greater than isoprenaline greater than prenalterol, indicating that the increase in noradrenaline was a beta 2-receptor-mediated response. This was supported by the antagonistic effects of atenolol and propranolol on this response. Adrenaline 30 ng/kg/min i.v. raised plasma adrenaline by a factor of 10 in 17 subjects with borderline hypertension. Plasma noradrenaline rose from 218 +/- 29 to 264 +/- 35 pg/ml (mean +/- s.e.m., P less than 0.05). The increments in blood pressure and plasma noradrenaline in response to cold exposure and isometric exercise were greater during the adrenaline infusion than during saline. This effect of adrenaline was antagonized by propranolol 0.5 mg i.v. These in vivo results lend support to the view that adrenaline may act as a physiological modulator of sympathetic neurotransmission by facilitating the release of noradrenaline through activation of presynaptic beta 2-type receptors.", 
    "28": "We performed this study in order to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade. A highly beta 2-selective antagonist (ICI 118.551) was given to 15 male patients with essential hypertension who had previously shown a lowering of blood pressure in response to beta 1-selective or nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade. After a four-week placebo period ICI 118.551 was given (50 or 100 mg t.i.d.) for one week (randomized, double-blind). Before and 3 h after the first dose blood pressure, central and peripheral haemodynamics were studied by impedance cardiography and forearm plethysmography respectively. Blood pressure and heart rate were also measured after one week of treatment. After acute administration of drug cardiac output fell 14% (P less than 0.001) due to a fall in heart rate from 69 to 61 beats/min (P less than 0.002). Mean arterial pressure was unchanged (112 mmHg) and total peripheral resistance increased 18% (P less than 0.01). A similar rise in forearm resistance could be seen (14%). There was no reduction in blood pressure after one week of treatment although heart rate remained significantly reduced. Selective beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade does not lower blood pressure in patients previously responding to beta 1-or beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "29": "The participation of noradrenaline (NE) and serotonine (5-HT) in self-stimulation (SS) of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPC) in the rat has been studied. Three groups of rats with bilateral electrodes implanted into the MPC were used in these experiments. In one of the groups, electrodes were also implanted into the locus coeruleus. In the first group, the rats received systemic injections of the following drugs: clonidine (alpha-agonist), phenoxybenzamine (alpha-antagonist), isoproterenol (beta-agonist) and propranolol (beta-antagonist). In the second group, p-chlorophenylalanine (a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor) was administered intragastrically and SS measured during the following 16 days. In these two groups of rats and previous to every SS session, spontaneous motor activity (SM) was measured as control for non specific effects of the drugs. In a third group of rats, lesions of the locus coeruleus were performed unilaterally and SS measured in both prefrontal cortex during the following 16 days post-lesion. SS contralateral to the lesioned side served as control for non-specific effects of the lesions. After all these treatments, SS of the MPC was not specifically affected. Our results suggest the non participation of NE and 5-HT terminals in the neural substrates underlying SS of the MPC.", 
    "30": "The responses of the rainbow lizard (Agama agama Linn.) isolated portal vein to transmural electrical stimulation and to drugs have been examined. The isolated venous muscle preparation strongly contracted in response to exogenously administered adrenaline and noradrenaline (10(-8)-2.5 x 10(-6) M) and also weakly contracted to acetylcholine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (10(-7) - 10(-5) M). The vein relaxed in response to exogenous administrations of isoprenaline (10(-8) - 2.5 x 10(-6) M) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 10(-7) - 10(-5) M). Transmural electrical stimulation of the isolated vein at 1-40 Hz induced frequency-dependent contractions of the venous smooth muscle which were inhibited or abolished by tetrodotoxin, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers, adrenergic neurone blocking agents, local anaesthetics, and by pretreatment of rainbow lizards with reserpine. Analysis of these findings shows that the electrical stimulation-evoked contractions of the venous blood vessel resulted from the excitation of post-ganglionic sympathetic neurones. A comparison of the relative potentiation of the venous preparation contractions induced by electrical stimulation, adrenaline and noradrenaline suggested that noradrenaline is the sympathetic transmitter mediating the contractile effects due to electrical excitation. The advantages of this preparation for studying sympathetic nerve-smooth muscle mechanisms and as a pharmacological model for investigating venous blood vessel activity are discussed.", 
    "31": "The KA value of a full agonist (Furchgott, 1966) is usually calculated following the transformation of a rectangular hyperbolic relationship between equiactive concentrations into a linear relationship via a double reciprocal plot. Such a transformation will introduce error into the value of KA unless the pre- and postinactivation dose-response curves are also rectangular hyperbolas. Nonlinear curve fitting computer programs, which have been developed to evaluate radioligand binding data, fit data to rectangular hyperbolas and, thus, can be used to fit concentration-response data for pre- and postinactivation curves. Examination of (-)-isoprenaline concentration-response curves for positive inotropic effects in left atrial preparations from the guinea pig, established before and after treatment with the irreversible antagonist Ro 03-7894, indicated a marked deviation from the theoretical rectangular hyperbola (Hill coefficient greater than 1). This was accounted for by the presence of a threshold effect. The present study reports on the use of the computer program LIGAND to fit a rectangular hyperbola to the pre- and postinactivation curves for an agonist, while simultaneously calculating and allowing for the presence of a threshold phenomenon. Since both curves are fitted to rectangular hyperbolas, the KA values can be calculated with greater precision than that possible from double reciprocal plots constructed from uncorrected concentration-response curves.", 
    "32": "In this study we investigated the effects of chronic beta adrenoreceptor blockade with atenolol on cellular and subcellular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Atenolol was injected subcutaneously (20 mg/kg) twice daily commencing in four-week-old rats. The treated animals (SHR-A) were compared to their nontreated controls and normotensive, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls at the age of 16 weeks. A group of atenolol-treated WKY was also studied. Chronic drug treatment was effective in attenuating the rise in systolic blood pressure characteristic of SHR, but did not normalize the values to those of WKY. Cardiac hypertrophy, characteristic of SHR, was modified by drug treatment as evidenced by left ventricular weights as well as myocardial cell size. The cells from the subendocardium underwent selective hypertrophy in SHR which was attenuated by about 50% after atenolol treatment. Stereological analysis of electron micrographs showed that while relative mitochondrial volume was not affected by treatment, relative myofibrillar volume (%) decreased in both subepicardium (SHR = 63.28 +/- 1.25; SHR-A = 56.72 +/- 1.37) and subendocardium (SHR = 66.53 +/- 1.27; SHR-A = 58.30 +/- 1.51). This change raised the mitochondrial/myofibrillar volume ratio, which is characteristically low in SHR compared to WKY. Sarcoplasm, which included all cell constituents except mitochondria, increased with atenolol treatment, but water concentration remained unchanged. The data suggest that attenuation of hypertrophy in SHR after beta blockade is associated with selective effects on the myocardial cell involving primarily the myofibrillar cell compartment.", 
    "33": "Ca spike suppressions induced by isoproterenol (IsP) and a beta 2-agonist, 5-hydroxymethyl-6-hydroxy-2-isopropylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene -1-ol (AA497), were investigated in the presence of butoxamine or practolol. The relaxations were isotonically recorded, and the Ca spike frequency was recorded using the single sucrose gap method. IsP-induced relaxation was not inhibited by butoxamine (Butox, 0.16 microM), but was inhibited by practolol (Prac, 0.188 microM). In 24 mM K+-Krebs' solution, AA497 caused relaxation in a lower dose range and suppressed to a small extent the Ca spike frequency in a higher dose range, as was observed for IsP-induced curves of log dose-spike frequency and log dose-relaxation. In normal K+-Krebs' solution, both IsP and AA497 greatly suppressed the Ca spike frequency. IsP (1.21 microM)-induced suppression of the Ca spike frequency was blocked by Prac (113 microM), and it was blocked by Butox (96 microM) to a greater extent. AA497-induced suppression of the spikes was not blocked by Prac (37.6 microM), but completely blocked by Butox (32 microM). These selective inhibitory effects of butoxamine on AA497-induced and IsP-induced Ca spike suppression demonstrate that in the adrenergic beta-receptor-mediated process in taenia coli, beta 2-mechanisms are more closely related to the Ca spike suppression than the beta 1-mechanisms are.", 
    "34": "beta-Haloalkylamines bind at two sites on the adrenergic alpha-receptor, one related to the noradrenaline-recognition site and the other possibly concerned with the calcium channel. In order to verify whether this might apply to other alpha-blockers the tetramine disulfide benextramine was selected owing to its unprecedented covalent selectivity towards the adrenergic alpha-receptor. The fast acting beta-haloalkylamine DMPEA and the \"classical\" calcium antagonist verapamil were used for protection experiments against benextramine blockade of rat vas deferens adrenergic alpha-receptor. It was demonstrated that two target thiols are probably involved in benextramine binding and one of them might possibly be located at the periphery of, or masked within, the calcium channel which may be connected physiologically to the adrenergic alpha-receptor. However, the hypothesis that the present results could indicate the selective interaction of benextramine with two different subtypes of the adrenergic alpha-receptor is also discussed.", 
    "35": "Non-adrenergic non-cholinergic parasympathetic secretory responses in parotid glands of rats have been demonstrated by electrical stimulation of the auriculo-temporal nerve after appropriate blocking drugs and compared with secretion in the absence of these drugs. After atropine +/- adrenergic blocking drugs secretion was greatly reduced but some secretion was always evident at frequencies of 5 Hz and higher. The time taken for secretion to appear was greatly increased and this may relate to an absence of accompanying myoepithelial contraction. Continuous stimulation always produced greater flows of saliva than intermittent bursts of stimulation at higher frequencies both in the absence and in the presence of blocking drugs. Thus it is likely in vivo that secretion is induced by relatively steady nerve-impulse traffic at moderate frequencies rather than by bursts of high frequency stimulation. Possible transmitters contributing to the atropine-resistant secretion are considered.", 
    "36": "The dissipation phenomena associated with timolol have important implications in the clinical management of glaucoma patients. Shortterm \"escape\" and longterm \"drift\" are clinical terms which describe the reduction of timolol's efficacy over a few days and over months and years, respectively. Recent physiological studies suggest a cellular explanation for these readjustments in tissue responsiveness to continued administration of timolol. While the precise location of the physiologically responding cells and the interactions of the various adrenergic responsive elements remain unclear, subsensitivity and supersensitivity may prove to be the most accurate designations for alterations in tissue responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation following \"down regulation\" or \"up regulation\" of beta receptor density on cell membranes.", 
    "37": "beta-Adrenergic blockade was imposed on cats with ischaemic regions of the left ventricle produced by coronary artery occlusion. Ten animals first received a beta 1-blocking agent (atenolol) followed by a beta 2-blocking agent (IPS 339). In ten more animals this sequence was reversed. Combined blockade, obtained after both agents were administered, showed clear reduction of tissue blood flow in all areas of the ventricle, except for the central ischaemic zone. The flow reduction could be ascribed to bradycardia and reduced coronary perfusion pressure. By analysing the sequential changes it was evident that blockade of beta 1-adrenergic receptors was responsible for the haemodynamic changes, and the coronary vascular resistance rose so as to match the quantity of blood flow to the functional state of the ventricle. Blockade of beta 2-receptors by IPS 339, however, showed no evidence of coronary vasoconstriction but rather maintained vascular resistance at an unchanged level despite a weak beta 1-adrenergic blocking effect.", 
    "38": "The effects of acute hypercapnia on cardiac contractility and their dependence on adrenergic pathways were studied in 27 piglets anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, ip). Aortic pressures and flow, and heart rate were held constant; atropine was used to produce parasympathetic blockade. Hypercapnia was achieved by addition of CO2 to the respirator. In the control group (N = 7) the first derivative of left ventricular (LV) pressure (dP/dtmax) increased significantly following induction of severe hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than 80 mm Hg; pH less than 7.00). There were no significant changes in LV end diastolic pressure. The magnitude of the positive inotropic responses was unaltered by ganglionic blockade with tetraethylammonium chloride (100 mg) (N = 5). In contrast, no change in LV dP/dtmax was observed during hypercapnia in piglets (N = 15) subjected to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade with practolol (4 mg/kg). Our findings indicate that the increased cardiac contractility during acute severe hypercapnia is not dependent upon the integrity of the neural reflex system. Rather, it is due to adrenal release of catecholamines into the circulation. These animals are highly resistant to the intrinsic cardiac depressant action of hypercapnic acidosis.", 
    "39": "The treatment of hypertension should be a stepwise approach to the problem. The mild forms can be handled by diuretics. More severe forms are successfully treated by a combination of beta-blocker, vasodilator and diuretics. In resistent cases the Angiotensin II - inhibitor (Captopril) can be tried. In emergency situations with malignant hypertension more powerful vasodilators like diazoxid or Nitroprussid Sodium are necessary. For the discontinuation treatment interruption a slow reduction of drugs is recommended as rebound-phenomena can be expected.", 
    "40": "The occurrence of beta 2-adrenoceptors in the isolated, spontaneously beating right atrium and the electrically driven left atrium of the guinea-pig was studied. Isoprenaline was used as reference compound and procaterol as selective beta 2-agonist. Cumulative concentration response (C/R) curves were obtained with the agonists. The C/R curve of procaterol was biphasic in both preparations. Compared with isoprenaline, procaterol was a partial agonist, with a mean maximum response of 0.78 +/- 0.04 in the right atrium and 0.29 +/- 0.05 in the left atrium. The beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118,551, 10(-7) mol litre-1, caused a small but significant shift of the C/R curve of isoprenaline to a higher concentration range in both preparations. The same concentration of the beta 2-blocker changed the shape of the C/R curve of procaterol from biphasic to monophasic by blocking the responses to low concentrations of procaterol. Practolol, a beta 1-selective antagonist, 10(-6) mol litre-1, gave a highly significant shift of the C/R curve of isoprenaline to a higher concentration range in both preparations but had no effect on the responses to low concentrations of procaterol. The effect of practolol on the responses to high concentrations of procaterol is discussed. We conclude that the guinea-pig atria may contain beta 2-adrenoceptors mediating positive chronotropic and inotropic effects.", 
    "41": "Relaxant responses to isoprenaline (ISO), adrenaline (ADR) and noradrenaline (NA) were investigated on carbachol-contracted, isolated tracheal smooth muscle preparations of the adult pig to determine the nature of the beta-adrenoreceptors present. The order of relaxant potencies of the catecholamines on this preparation was ISO greater than ADR greater than NA. The potency ratio at 37 degrees C was 1:0.06:0.005. This suggests that beta 2-adrenoreceptors predominate in isolated tracheal smooth muscle of the adult pig. Though the order of potency for the above catecholamines did not change, at the lower temperatures of 29 degrees and 33 degrees C, the potency ratios were slightly modified to 1:0.0.98:0.004 and 1:0.07:0.004 respectively. pA2 values on pig tracheal smooth muscle were 8.65 and 9.13 respectively, for the non-selective beta-blockers propranolol and alprenolol, and 5.63, 5.20 and 6.26 respectively, for the beta 1 selective blockers practolol, atenolol and metoprolol and 6.82 for the beta 2 selective beta-blocker, H 35/25. The results suggest the existence and predominance of beta 2-adrenoreceptors in tracheal smooth muscle of the adult pig.", 
    "42": "Effect of preliminary administration of the alpha-adrenoblocker phentolamine and the beta-adrenoblocker inderal on stress-induced disturbances of myocardial extensibility, contractile function and myocardial resistance to hypoxia and excess Ca2+ was studied on an isometrically contracting isolated right atrium of the rat. Inderal substantially prevented the post-stress decrease in atrial extensibility and almost completely prevented the stress-induced decline in the developed tension and the Frank-Starling mechanism efficiency. At the same time inderal prevented the post-stress increase in hypoxic and hypercalcium contracture of the atrium. Phentolamine did not produce any such protective effects. It is suggested that the damaging action of catecholamine excess occurring under stress is mediated via beta-adrenoreceptors but not via alpha-adrenoreceptors of the heart.", 
    "43": "The rise in plasma adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate occurring in response to insulin induced hypoglycaemia in normal human subjects, was abolished by non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade but unaffected by selective beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. This implies that the rise is secondary to beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. The abolition of this rise by non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade had no pronounced effect on the recovery from hypoglycaemia. Endogenous opiate receptor blockade with naloxone had no significant effect on the recovery from insulin induced hypoglycaemia, or the hormonal mechanisms involved.", 
    "44": "The effects on heart rate, blood pressure and pulmonary function of single oral doses of prizidilol hydrochloride (400 mg SK&F 92657) and propranolol (40 mg) were compared with placebo in nine healthy volunteers, in a double blind crossover study. Prizidilol had no effect on heart rate while propranolol caused a significant reduction compared with placebo. Diastolic blood pressure was lowered to the same extent by both prizidilol and propranolol. Propranolol significantly reduced the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and the maximal expiratory flow at 50% vital capacity (MEF 50). Prizidilol had no effect on flow-volume loop parameters. Effective pulmonary blood flow was not altered by propranolol, but it was significantly increased by prizidilol. Oral prizidilol exerts its hypotensive effect by vasodilatation without reflex tachycardia. It does not cause airways obstruction in healthy subjects.", 
    "45": "To determine whether the beta 2-selectivity of ICI 118551 extended to human airways, we measured bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade and the reduction in exercise heart rate in six normal subjects on different occasions after ingestion of ICI 118551 20 or 50 mg, propranolol 40 mg or placebo in random order. Bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade after each active drug was measured as the displacement of the airway dose-response curve to salbutamol and expressed as a dose ratio. Exercise heart rate was measured during the fifth minute of steady state exercise at 70% of the subject's maximum work load. The mean dose ratios for the salbutamol airway dose-response curves following ICI 118551 20 and 50 mg and propranolol 40 mg were 11, 55 and 48 respectively. The mean reductions in exercise heart rate for the three drugs were 0.6, 6.6 and 16.6% respectively. These results confirm that the beta 2-selectivity of ICI 118551 includes airway beta 2-adrenoceptors in man.", 
    "46": "A brief bout of vigorous exercise results in significant increases in plasma epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) in the dogfish, Squalus acanthias. Since the presence of a functioning sympathetic nervous system in dogfish is in doubt, experiments were undertaken to show whether or not exercise-induced catecholamine (CA) secretion is under autonomic neurogenic control. Changes in plasma E and NE in a control group of exercised fish were compared with changes in fish exercised while under the influence of ganglionic blockade. Ganglionic blockade was induced in dogfish by hexamethonium infusion before exercise. CA secretion in response to a subsequent bout of exercise was significantly reduced without impairment of the ability of the fish to exercise. The pattern of systemic arterial pressure response to exercise and recovery (initial decrease during exercise followed by a prompt recovery to control level) was not significantly altered by ganglionic blockade. It is concluded that in dogfish some fraction of CA secretion capacity is possibly or potentially under neurogenically related control. Apparently the fraction of CA secretion under such control is not essential for performing exercise. The pattern of CA secretion accompanying the events of exercise and recovery in dogfish suggests that CA may play a more important role in recovery from exercise than in its performance.", 
    "47": "The neural mediation of acid-stimulated serotonin release was studied in isolated sheets of rabbit duodenal mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers. The serosal side of the mucosa was exposed to Ringer-HCO3 at pH 7.4, and the mucosal side was exposed to citrate-phosphate buffer at pH 3-6.8. Immunoreactive serotonin release occurred onto the luminal surface at pH 6 and below and onto the serosal surface at pH 5 and below, but was greater on the luminal side at each pH. The effect of cholinergic and adrenergic agonists and antagonists on mucosal serotonin release was measured at luminal pH 7.4, 5, and 4. Acid-stimulated luminal release was significantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium, and propranolol at pH 4 and 5 but not by phentolamine. Serotonin release was stimulated at pH 7.4 and 4 by carbachol and isoproterenol but not by norepinephrine or nicotine at pH 7.4. It is concluded that acid-induced and nonacid-induced mucosal serotonin release is partly neurally mediated by muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "48": "We investigated the effect of the carboxyl-selective reagent N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) on aldosterone stimulation of Na+ transport in the urinary bladder of the toad. Na+ transport, measured as the short-circuit current (SCC), was irreversibly inhibited by EEDQ in a dose- and time-dependent manner prior to addition of aldosterone. The greater the percentage inhibition by EEDQ (X), the smaller was the maximal increase of SCC after aldosterone (Y). This relationship gave the regression equation Y = 128.41 - 1.73X, r = -0.99 (n = 35). Evidence that the inhibition of SCC produced by EEDQ was limited to effects at the mucosal membrane was attested by the following: 1) EEDQ did not alter the stimulation by aldosterone of the osmotic water flow response to antidiuretic hormone; 2) whereas inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide prevented this effect of aldosterone; 3) amphotericin B fully restored SCC previously inhibited by EEDQ to the level produced in tissues not inhibited by EEDQ; 4) comparison of the effects of amiloride vs. EEDQ pretreatment on the SCC response to aldosterone and amphotericin B revealed nearly identical characteristics; 5) in contrast, amphotericin B stimulation of SCC was limited when Na+ transport was limited by antimycin A (an inhibitor of energy production) or by ouabain. The findings fail to provide positive evidence for the hypothesis that aldosterone induces the synthesis of new Na+ channels but are consistent with hormonal activation of previously existing but nonfunctioning Na+ channels.", 
    "49": "Two titratable groups, with effect on Na+ transport and with apparent acid dissociation constants (pKaS) of 4.2 and 6.7, were found in the apical membrane of toad urinary bladder and are tentatively identified as a carboxyl and an imidazole. N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), a reagent selective for carboxyl residues, inhibits Na+ transport in the urinary bladder of toads. The underlying chemical reaction whereby EEDQ produces inhibition through potential modification of carboxyl residues was studied. The inhibitory action of EEDQ on Na+ transport was dependent on pH of reaction media and availability of nucleophile, indicating that formation of a covalent acyl-nucleophile bond is probably involved in the irreversible inhibition of Na+ transport. The kinetics of the inhibition showed a stoichiometry of formation of one acyl-nucleophile bond per closure of one Na+ transport site, presumably the Na+ channel. The nucleophile that appears to be involved in the formation of the acyl-nucleophile bond was tentatively identified as having an apparent pKa of 6.7. Amiloride and two analogues of amiloride added to the mucosal Ringer solution (but not serosal amiloride) protected against inhibition of Na+ transport by EEDQ--a finding consistent with the hypothesis that the EEDQ-activated carboxyl group undergoes reaction with a nucleophile at or near the site of specific binding of amiloride onto the apical membrane, most likely at the Na+ channel. Our findings led us to postulate that amiloride must interact with at least two sites on the Na+ channel in order to block the channel. One of the two sites appears to be an ionic interaction between the anionic carboxyl group at the Na+ channel and the cationic guanidinium group of amiloride.", 
    "50": "Six normal humans each underwent infusions of 1) saline; 2) propranolol; 3) somatostatin; 4) somatostatin with propranolol; and 5) somatostatin with propranolol plus phentolamine on separate occasions. Propranolol alone had no effect on glucose production or plasma glucose. Somatostatin alone produced the expected initial decrease followed by an increase in both hepatic glucose production and plasma glucose. beta-Adrenergic blockade with propranolol displaced the glucose production (MANOVA, P = 0.0220) and plasma glucose (MANOVA, P = 0.0057) somatostatin response curves to higher levels, whereas alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine combined with beta-adrenergic blockade displaced the glucose production (MANOVA, P = 0.0281) and plasma glucose (MANOVA, P = 0.0134) somatostatin response curves to lower levels. Because plasma insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon were suppressed comparably under all three conditions and plasma glucose concentrations were comparable initially, this represents direct alpha-adrenergic stimulation of hepatic glucose production in postabsorptive humans demonstrable when the primary glucoregulatory hormones are withdrawn and beta-adrenergic mechanisms are blocked. It is best attributed to sympathetic neural norepinephrine release.", 
    "51": "We studied the autonomic nervous control of pancreatic somatostatin secretion using isolated perfused pig pancreases prepared with either intact vagal or splanchnic nerve supply. Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves increased pancreatic protein output 59-fold, whereas somatostatin output decreased to 57% of prestimulatory secretion. Acetylcholine mimicked the somatostatin response to vagal stimulation, and atropine abolished the inhibition. Splanchnic nerve stimulation increased perfusion pressure up to threefold, whereas somatostatin output decreased to 68%. Phenoxybenzamine abolished the pressure response to splanchnic nerve stimulation and reversed the inhibition to a 20% increase in somatostatin output. Propranolol did not influence the inhibitory effect of splanchnic stimulation but abolished the increase seen after phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that both divisions of the autonomic nerve supply to the pancreas are inhibitory to somatostatin secretion, but increased secretion may be brought about by a beta-adrenergic mechanism.", 
    "52": "In a double-masked randomised cross-over study the effect of adding oral propranolol (40 mg X 2) to topical timolol-treatment (0.5% X 2) was evaluated. Ten patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension (totally 15 pathological eyes and 5 healthy) who had had topical timolol for at least 2 months received the coded oral treatment. A significant decrease of the intraocular pressure (3.68 +/- 0.72 SD, P less than 0.01) was observed in the timolol-treated eyes after the addition of the masked treatment with placebo/propranolol. Also the non-timolol-treated fellow eyes had a significant decrease of the intraocular pressure. It is suggested that this additive effects depends on a loss of efficacy of the topical beta-blocker caused by an increase in the number of beta-receptors and that the oral beta-blocker restores the degree of blocking to a more efficient level.", 
    "53": "Abnormal cell-cell interactions at the vessel wall play an important role in the development of microvascular occlusions. Since beta-blocking drugs have been implicated in the long-term and short-term prevention of myocardial infarction, we investigated the possibility that these drugs might exert their action by interfering with red cell-endothelial interactions. 51Cr-labeled, washed erthrocytes were added to confluent monolayers of cultured human vascular endothelial cells. After incubation at 37 degrees C, the nonadherent red cells were removed by sequential washing. When red cells were pretreated by cardioselective or noncardioselective beta-blocking drugs (e.g., metoprolol and propranolol), significantly fewer erythrocytes remained adherent to the endothelial monolayers after repeated washing. Pretreatment of the endothelium did not result in decreased adherence, indicating that the inhibitory action of beta-blockers is exerted on the red cell itself. The specificity of red cell-endothelial interactions is illustrated by the finding that erythrocytes adhere significantly less to plastic surfaces. In parallel studies, we have shown that beta-blockers significantly both diminish erythrocyte viscosity and increase erythrocyte deformability. The precise mechanisms of cellular action by which beta-blockers exert these actions remain unknown. Differences in beta-receptor subtypes do not seem to be involved, but complex metabolic changes leading to alterations in physiological properties of the red cell membrane cannot be excluded. Finally, our results suggest that the presumed beneficial effects of beta-blockade in various prethrombotic conditions (e.g., hypertension, angina pectoris, reinfarction) may be partly due to the interference of these drugs with the normal and abnormal adhesive and rheological properties of human erythrocytes.", 
    "54": "The relationship between renin release evoked by circulating beta-agonists and the renal prostaglandin (PG) system is incompletely defined. Thus, we evaluated systemic and renal hemodynamic responses to iv (0.5 micrograms/kg X min) and intrarenal arterial (0.6 micrograms/kg X min) infusions of the beta1-agonist prenalterol (PNL) in four separate groups of anesthetized dogs. Consecutive iv PNL infusions (n = 6) resulted in a reversible decrease in mean arterial pressure (130 to 117 mm Hg; P less than 0.05) and increases in cardiac output (3.93 to 4.90 liters/min; P less than 0.001), PRA (1.96 to 5.12 ng/ml X h; P less than 0.01), and 6-keto-PGF 1 alpha levels (190 to 482 pg/ml; P less than 0.01). The glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow were modestly, but not significantly, decreased by the PNL infusions. In a second group of dogs, the infusion of the PG synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (IN; 10 mg/kg, iv; n = 7) before the second PNL infusion blunted PG increases but did not significantly modify the systemic or renal hemodynamic responses to PNL. The magnitude of the PRA and renin secretory rate (RSR) increases post-IN administration was similar to control values, but the absolute levels achieved were not as great as before IN infusion. To assess the role of the renal baroreceptor pathway to renin release after PNL, a suprarenal clamp was used to maintain a constant renal perfusion pressure during PNL infusion in a third group of dogs. In this group (n = 5), both PRA and RSR (from innervated and denervated kidneys) increased after PNL infusion, although IN again diminished the maximum PRA and RSR responses observed. Finally, the unilateral intrarenal arterial infusion of PNL in the last group of dogs did not alter PRA, RSR, or renal hemodynamics. These results demonstrate that renin release elicited by a circulating beta-agonist functions independently of PG synthesis, and that the pathway operates via an extrarenal mechanism.", 
    "55": "The effects of 0.25 mg/kg dipyridamole on left ventricular (LV) pressures, LV dP/dt, heart rate, aortic pressures, left circumflex coronary blood flow, and left circumflex coronary arterial diameters and on calculations of late diastolic coronary resistance and large coronary cross-sectional area were studied in 15 conscious dogs. Injection of dipyridamole, a drug that has a mechanism of action dependent on myocardial adenosine production, caused sustained increases in mean coronary blood flow (244 +/- 28%), large coronary arterial cross-sectional area (28 +/- 3.2%), heart rate (32 +/- 3.6%), and LV dP/dt (23 +/- 3.0%) and reductions in late diastolic coronary resistance (73 +/- 2.4%) and mean arterial pressure (14 +/- 1.9%). Neither beta-adrenergic-receptor blockade alone nor in conjunction with constant heart rate affected the dilation of large coronary arteries to dipyridamole significantly. Ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium also had little effect on the response of large and small coronary vessels to dipyridamole. Surprisingly neither beta-adrenergic-receptor nor ganglionic blockade abolished the rise in LV dP/dt observed after dipyridamole. Aminophylline, however, effectively eliminated the dilation of large coronary arteries and resistance coronary vessels in response to dipyridamole. In summary, as long as dipyridamole does not induce severe sustained hypotension it exerts potent effects on both coronary arterial resistance and large coronary arteries in the conscious dog. The coronary dilation is independent of reflex adrenergic activation, but appears dependent on myocardial adenosine production.", 
    "56": "The highly specific beta-adrenoceptor radioligand, (+/-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol, has been used to subclassify beta-adrenoceptors in membranes from human right atrial appendage obtained during open heart surgery. Binding of (+/-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol was saturable (Bmax = 86.4 +/- 7.4 fmol (+/-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol bound/mg protein, n = 4), of high affinity (KD = 53 +/- 6 pM, n = 4), rapid, reversible, and stereospecific. The relative potencies of isoprenaline, adrenaline, and noradrenaline for inhibition of (+/-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding and activation of adenylate cyclase were 1:10:10, indicating a population composed mainly of beta 1-adrenoceptors. Inhibition of (+/-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding by beta 1- (practolol, metoprolol, betaxolol) and beta 2- (IPS 339, ICI 118,551, zinterol, procaterol) selective drugs, however, resulted in biphasic displacement curves with slope factors (nH, pseudo Hill coefficients) significantly less than 1.0. Nonlinear regression analysis of these curves revealed a beta 1: beta 2 ratio of 80:20 in human right atrial appendage. Nonselective beta-adrenergic drugs (propranolol, isoprenaline, and adrenaline), on the contrary, inhibited binding with monophasic displacement curves and nH = 1.0. Binding of agonists to the beta-adrenoceptors in human right atrial appendage seems to be regulated by guanyl nucleotides. In the absence of GTP, isoprenaline binds to high and low affinity state of the beta-adrenoceptors. GTP (10(-4) M) converts this heterogeneous binding into a homogeneous one of low affinity. It is concluded that, in human right atria, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors coexist; however, beta 1-adrenoceptors predominate. The physiological function of beta 2-adrenoceptors in human right atrium remains to be elucidated.", 
    "57": "beta-Adrenoceptors of the human myocardium were investigated with binding studies using 125iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) as ligand. Inhibition of ICYP-binding by betaxolol (a selective beta 1-antagonist) and ICI 118551 (a selective beta 2-blocking drug) resulted in non-linear Scatchard-plots suggesting that both beta-adrenoceptor subtypes are present in human left atrium and left ventricle. Computer analysis of the data gave a beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptor ratio of approximately 65:35 both for left atrium and for left ventricle.", 
    "58": "The effects of 5-MeODMT (2.5 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), methysergide and the stereoisomers of propranolol (6 mg/kg) on hyponeophagia were studied in both sexes of the Roman strains of rats, selectively bred for acquisition of a two-way conditioned avoidance response. Diazepam, methysergide and 1-propranolol increased feeding in a novel environment whilst 5-MeODMT decreased it and d-propranolol was inactive. Several strain differences in drug responsiveness occurred, the Roman Low Avoidance subjects being most sensitive to all drugs tested as well as being most neophobic. A sex difference in 5-MeODMT sensitivity was also found, female rats of the Roman High and Control Avoidance strains being more sensitive than males. The findings are discussed in connection with differences in arousal and biochemical parameters between these strains.", 
    "59": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study the effect and duration of effect of 2% nitroglycerin ointment (2 cm/m2 body surface) and 50 mg atenolol, as the only drug or the two in combination, were tested on 16 patients with coronary heart disease. Heart rate at rest and on exercise rose significantly for up to 3 1/2 hours (P less than 0.01) after application of the nitroglycerin ointment. Systolic blood pressure at rest and five minutes after exercise was significantly reduced (P less than 0.01), while on exercise there was no significant difference from the control value. Pressure X heart rate product was significantly raised over the initial value up to 3 1/2 hours after application, at maximal exercise (P less than 0.05), while after atenolol there was a highly significant reduction compared with the placebo (P less than 0.01), even after six hours. S-T depression was reduced at maximal comparable exercise level by 49% after atenolol, 52% after nitroglycerin ointment and 76% after combination of the two (P less than 0.05). Exercise tolerance was on average increased for 1 1/2 hours after atenolol by 36%, after nitroglycerin ointment by 58% and after the combined application by 84%, compared with the placebo (P less than 0.01). In the latter (combination) group the pressure X heart rate product was definitely below that of the nitroglycerin ointment group. Thus additional administration of 50 mg atenolol can decrease the pressure X heart rate product after application of nitroglycerin ointment, at the same time increasing exercise tolerance and reducing the degree of S-T depression.", 
    "60": "The beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT) was a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial of the long-term administration of propranolol hydrochloride to persons who had had at least one confirmed myocardial infarction. Among 3,837 patients followed up for an average of 25 months, coronary incidence, defined as recurrent nonfatal definite reinfarction plus fatal coronary heart disease, in the propranolol group was 10.0%, compared with 13.0% in the placebo group, a reduction of 23%. The incidence of definite nonfatal reinfarction was lower by 15.6%, and that of definite or probable nonfatal reinfarction by 14.7%. Among patients with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), 14.8% of the propranolol-treated patients experienced definite CHF during the study, as did 12.6% of the placebo-treated patients. Among patients without history of CHF, the percentages experiencing CHF were 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. In patients with no history of angina, the incidence of angina was 35.7% in the propranolol group and 34.4% in the placebo group. Among those who had a history of angina, the incidence was 66% in both groups. The BHAT analyses of nonfatal events reinforce the previous recommendation for the use of propranolol in the treatment of patients who have had a recent myocardial infarction and who have no contraindications to beta-blockers.", 
    "61": "Evidence has been obtained that prazosin possesses a presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocking action in the rat was deferens preparation stimulated at 1 Hz. In the presence of prazosin yohimbine failed to affect the presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulatory effect of 1-noradrenaline while the effect of xylazine was almost completely abolished. It is therefore suggested that there are two kinetically different prejunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptor sites.", 
    "62": "Incubation of 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells with 1 microM isoproterenol rapidly results in the conversion of a portion of the beta-adrenergic receptors to a membrane form that can be separated from markers for the plasma membrane by sucrose density gradient or differential centrifugation. This \"light peak\" form of the receptor reaches a maximal level within 10 min of incubation of cells with catecholamine. Two types of experiments suggest that the early phase of catecholamine-induced desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor-linked adenylate cyclase can be separated into at least two reactions. First, the agonist-induced loss of catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity precedes the appearance of beta-adrenergic receptors in the light peak fraction by 1-2 min. Second, pretreatment of cells with concanavalin A prior to induction of desensitization blocks the formation of the light peak form of beta-adrenergic receptors without blocking the \"uncoupling\" reaction as measured by catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Specificity for the reaction that converts beta-adrenergic receptors to the light peak form is indicated by the lack of a catecholamine-induced alteration in the sucrose density gradient distribution of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, adenylate cyclase or the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, Ns and Ni. The light peak of beta-adrenergic receptors migrates at a density similar to that of at least a portion of the activity of galactosyltransferase, a marker for Golgi. Enzyme marker activities for lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum are not associated with this population of beta-adrenergic receptors. Taken together, these and other data suggest that incubation of 1321N1 cells with isoproterenol results in a rapid uncoupling of beta-adrenergic receptors from adenylate cyclase which is followed by a change in the membrane form of the receptor. This latter step most likely represents internalization of receptors into a vesicular form which may then serve as the precursor state from which receptors are eventually lost from the cell.", 
    "63": "Studies of beta-adrenergic receptors on several types of intact target cells indicate that agonists, but not antagonists, show prominent KD/Kact discrepancies--lower affinities (KD) in equilibrium binding studies (i.e. in competition with antagonist radioligands) than in functional assays (Kact). In this report we show that intact S49 lymphoma cells initially bind beta-adrenergic agonists in a high affinity manner but that this high affinity binding rapidly converts to a low affinity state. This time course is similar to that of agonist-mediated desensitization in S49 cells. In competitive binding studies conducted with [125I]iodocyanopindolol or [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, IC50 values for beta-adrenergic agonists increased 13-200-fold between 1 and 60 min, whereas antagonists yielded similar IC50 values at the two time points. The binding of antagonists, but not agonists, could be simulated by a computer model based on the law of mass action. In contrast with results in intact S49 cells, crude membrane fractions yielded similar IC50 values for agonists in 1- and 60-min incubations with [125I]iodocyanopindolol. Moreover, time-dependent decreases in apparent affinity of the agonist (-)-isoproterenol were observed not only in wild type S49 cells but also in several S49 variants (UNC, cyc-, H21a) having defects in Ns, the guanine nucleotide binding protein that couples receptors to activation of adenylate cyclase, and in Kin-, an S49 variant with absent cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. These results show that beta-adrenergic receptors of intact S49 cells demonstrate a prominent time-dependent decrease in apparent affinity for agonists and that this decrease in affinity does not require cAMP generation, the Ns components defective in several S49 variants or cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The rapid conversion of agonist binding from high to low affinity can account for the rapid desensitization of intact cells to catecholamines and probably explains previously reported KD/Kact discrepancies of intact cells.", 
    "64": "The inhibitory effects of fenoterol, a beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, on the release of SRS-A leukotrienes and histamine from chopped human lung tissue were measured and selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonists used to investigate the nature of the receptors involved. Fenoterol 0.01-1.0 microM inhibited the antigen-induced release of SRS-A and histamine, but not the release induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. Propranolol 0.1 and 1.0 microM and butoxamine 10 and 100 microM significantly antagonized the effects of fenoterol 0.1 microM on SRS-A and histamine at concentrations which affect (beta 2-adrenoceptors, while atenolol 0.1 to 10 microM showed no antagonism at concentrations which affect beta 1-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that adrenoceptors in human lung which modulate the immunological release of SRS-A leukotrienes are of the beta 2-subtype as for histamine release.", 
    "65": "Specific beta-adrenergic receptors have been identified in dissociated preparations of rabbit lung cells greatly enriched for alveolar type II cells and compared with receptors in preparations of mixed lung cells and erythrocytes. Freshly isolated type II cells as well as mixed dissociated lung cells and erythrocytes from fetal (28 days gestation) and adult rabbits contained high-affinity, low-capacity binding sites for [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA). Binding to all preparations was stereospecific and characteristic of the beta 1-subtype of beta-adrenergic receptors. The concentrations of the receptors were similar in mixed lung cells and alveolar type II cells, indicating that beta-adrenergic receptors are present not only in type II cells but also in other lung cell types. When the contribution of erythrocytes to receptor concentration observed in type II cells was determined, it was found to be insignificant. In mixed lung cells, both the affinity and concentration of the receptors were higher in adult than fetal preparations. The affinity of the receptors was also higher in adult than fetal type II cells, although we did not find a significant age-related difference in receptor concentrations in this cell type. These results suggest that stimulation of surfactant secretion observed after exposure of lung tissue to beta-adrenergic agonists is mediated by specific beta-adrenergic receptors on alveolar type II cells.", 
    "66": "The effect of the thyroid hormone(T4) on the internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors in isolated hepatocytes was examined. Uptake of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol(DHA) by the cells, which were prepared from untreated-rats, was increased by the time-dependent manner in vitro. The amount of incorporated-[3H]-DHA was decreased by further incubation in the presence of 10(-5) M of d, 1-isoproterenol. However, about 30% of incorporated-[3H]-DHA remained in the cells by this treatment. The amount of this [3H]-DHA remaining in the cells was lowered by pretreatment of the cells with methylamine, monodansylcadaverine, d, 1-isoproterenol or d, 1-propranolol. Then the amount of this [3H]-DHA was recognized as an internalized-receptor-hormone(or -DHA) complex. The total uptake(internalized- + membrane bound-) of [3H]-DHA by the cells was not significantly different between the thyroidectomized (TX + Saline) and T4-treated-thyroidectomized(TX + T4) rats. However, the rate of disappearance of incorporated-[3H]-DHA was greater in the TX + T4 animals compared to that in the TX + Saline animals. In the cells obtained from the TX + T4 animals, internalized-[3H]-DHA was significantly higher than that of the TX + Saline animals. The number of membrane associated beta adrenergic receptors was significantly lower in the TX + T4 group. These results suggest that the thyroid hormone induces an acceleration of internalization of beta adrenergic receptors in hepatocytes.", 
    "67": "30% of diabetics have arterial hypertension. 25% of patients with hypertension are diabetics. The rapid development of atherosclerosis is the main cause of morbidity and mortality among diabetics. Occasionally, prescription of a beta-blocking agent may seem rational in diabetics (hypertension, angina pectoris, etc.). But is such a medication acceptable considering the patient's fragile metabolic control? After a brief review of the pharmacology of the various beta-blocking agents, we discuss the choice of the best medication for the diabetic patient. Cardioselective beta-blockers seem to be best suited to diabetics. After insulin-induced hypoglycemia, rise in blood sugar level is less delayed and symptoms of hypoglycemia are less attenuated.", 
    "68": "3H-(+/-) propranolol and 125I-(+/-) cyanopindolol have been used to characterize beta adrenoceptors of liver, lung, kidney and heart of rat. Two main binding parameters, KD and Bmax were measured using either cells, homogenates or plasma membranes of each organ (except heart). Results show that the most accurate determination of KD and Bmax involves: (1) a previous extraction of plasma membranes (2) the use of a ligand of a high affinity for beta adrenoceptors (3) a high specific radioactivity of this ligand. 125I-(+/-) cyanopindolol seems to be a better ligand than 3H(+/-) propranolol for such determinations.", 
    "69": "The binding characteristics of the radio-iodinated beta-adrenoceptor antagonist ligand 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol (125I-IHYP) have been compared in membrane preparations derived from three different sources in a single mammalian species. In membrane preparations derived from rat lung and erythrocytes, 125I-IHYP binds solely to beta-adrenoceptors as defined by the stereoselectivity of the isomers of propranolol and the affinity of isoprenaline. However, in membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex, although some 30% of 125I-HYP binding is to beta-adrenoceptors, a large proportion of the remainder is to sites that exhibit characteristics for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) recognition. Thus, binding assays for 125I-IHYP in cerebral cortical membranes performed in the presence of 30 microM (-)-isoprenaline (to eliminate the binding of the ligand to beta-adrenoceptors) show that isomers of propranolol still maintain a degree of stereoselectivity at these sites. Also, 5HT and its congeners exhibit binding activity similar to that seen at 5HT receptors identified by 3H-5HT.", 
    "70": "The presence of beta-adrenergic receptors has been demonstrated in membrane preparations from passaged human epidermal keratinocytes. The receptors were characterized in terms of density and binding properties. Using the titrated beta-adrenergic antagonists dihydroalprenolol and propranolol, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was found to be about 1.4 nM for the two antagonists with a receptor density of approximately 280 fmol/mg membrane protein. Stereospecificity of the binding sites was shown by the much lowered affinity to D-isoproterenol as compared to that of L-isoproterenol. By the use of subtype specific antagonists, the receptors were classified as beta 2 adrenoceptors. This finding is supported by the relative order of affinities of the agonists isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine. The Kd value for dihydroalprenolol was approximately the same when determined from equilibrium binding studies or from association and dissociation kinetics, suggesting that the ligand binding is a single step bi-molecular reaction.", 
    "71": "Epinephrine stimulated glucose oxidation in isolated rat parotid cell aggregates through alpha- and beta-adrenergic mechanisms. The alpha-adrenergic component appeared to be of the alpha 1-receptor subtype as evidenced by inhibition studies with selective antagonists. Calcium mobilization in the presence of the ionophore A23187 was as capable as epinephrine in eliciting this response. Epinephrine stimulation of glucose oxidation was, however, only partially dependent on extracellular calcium. Only the upper 50% of the maximal (10(-5) M) epinephrine response required external calcium, since stimulation by 10(-6) M epinephrine, which elicits only about 40% of the maximal (10(-5) M epinephrine) response, was independent of external calcium. Furthermore, no external calcium dependence was observed for pure alpha- or beta-adrenergic stimulation alone, which comprised about 60 and 40%, respectively, of the maximal epinephrine response. Thus, adrenergic mediated parotid cell glucose oxidation may proceed by different mechanisms depending on the extent and nature of cellular stimulation.", 
    "72": "Previous studies have shown that sympathetic factors and blood glucose are of importance in the development of seizures and lung damage from OHP. In the present study we examined the influence of beta sympathetic agonists and blocking agents and glucagon on OHP toxicity. Rats were exposed to 6 ATA OHP and examined for time-to-seizure and lung damage. Pretreatment with propranolol increased the time-to-seizure by 70% and practolol by 50% without altering gross lung appearance or lung wet wt/dry wt. Propranolol and practolol also prevented brain glycogen depletion prior to seizure which otherwise occurred in subconvulsive exposure to OHP. Isoproterenol and glucagon pretreatment had no effect on time-to-seizure but isoproterenol did increase lung injury. Both practolol and propranolol block the beta-receptor influence on adenyl cyclase-stimulated second messenger production, while both isoproterenol and glucagon activate adenyl cyclase to produce second messenger. Our results may suggest a possible role for second messenger in mediating some of the acute toxic effects of OHP on the CNS.", 
    "73": "The locus coeruleus was stimulated in 62 cats in order to investigate the effect on cephalic blood flow and cephalic vascular resistance. Flow was measured by electromagnetic flow probes applied to the common carotid artery. Stimulation over a range of frequencies (0.2-200 s-1) produced a frequency-dependent fall in carotid vascular resistance, greater on the ipsilateral side. This response was not affected by either cervical sympathectomy or spinal cord section. The response was blocked by bilateral section of the facial nerve but was not abolished by classical cholinergic, histaminergic or adrenergic blocking agents. Stimulation of the locus coeruleus also resulted in a pressor response through spinal mechanisms in which coeruleo-hypothalamic projections were not involved. A post-stimulation constriction in the carotid vasculature followed the dilator response and was attributed to release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla.", 
    "74": "The adrenoceptors involved in the increase in diastolic pressure and heart rate elicited by i.v. administration of pilocarpine to the pithed rat were assessed using as pharmacological tools the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine, the beta 1-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol and the beta 2-adrenoceptor blocker ICI 118,551. Pilocarpine indirectly activated vascular alpha 1- and cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptors. By using the M-1 antagonist pirenzepine and the mixed M-1/M-2 antagonist dexetimide, pilocarpine was shown to be a mixed M-1/M-2 agonist. Pilocarpine initiated antagonistic effects on intrasynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses and not on those triggered by extrasynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors. During vasopressin infusion to counteract a possible vasodilator action of pilocarpine, it was demonstrated that pilocarpine indirectly activated alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The results support the hypothesis that intra- and extrasynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors comprise different populations and that the neuronal control of alpha 2-adrenoceptors is mediated by ganglionic M-2 receptors."
