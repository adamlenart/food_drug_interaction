    "0": "The beta-blocker carvedilol has been shown to induce vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study, we looked for the acute vasodilating effect after i.v. administration in patients with heart failure. In 10 patients with coronary artery disease and six patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, all with an ejection fraction lower than 40%, the rate-pressure-product during supine ergometry and Swan-Ganz-catheterization rose to a significantly smaller extent after 5 mg carvedilol i.v. compared to placebo. This was mainly due to a lower heart rate at rest and during exercise, while blood pressure was not changed compared to placebo. Calculated total peripheral resistance during exercise after carvedilol was higher--significantly so in the CAD-group--than after placebo. These results show that in patients with heart failure, an acute vasodilating effect of i.v. carvedilol is not detectable.", 
    "1": "There are two goals in the management of chronic heart failure: relief of symptoms and prolongation of life. Until recently, pharmacological interventions were tested primarily in order to evaluate their effects on exercise capacity and clinical symptoms. However, two multicenter trials have now provided evidence that treatment of chronic heart failure is able to improve mortality. Indeed, prolongation of life without improving symptoms is not desirable. The two classic keystones of therapy in heart failure, diuretics and digitalis, remain powerful agents to relieve symptoms. However, their impact on survival remains elusive, since no controlled studies are available which address this question with adequate sample size. Vasodilators such as the combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate and ACE-inhibitors, however, have been shown to improve survival in patients with moderate to severe chronic heart failure. In contrast, prazosin failed to be effective in this respect. More sophisticated questions emerge, in particular, do ACE-inhibitors or vasodilators, effectively interfere with the progression of the disease? May early treatment be preventive and retard the course of heart failure? Several large scale multicenter trials are now under way to address these issues.", 
    "2": "Increased sympatho-adrenergic activity is a compensatory mechanism in cardiac failure. Accordingly, beta-receptor blockers are generally regarded as contraindicated for use in heart failure. In 1975, Waagstein reported the first successful use of beta-receptor blockers in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. It was shown that the prognosis of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy could be improved by beta-receptor blockade. In this regard, most experience is associated with metoprolol. It should be stressed that the initial, and long-term dosage, as well, was maintained at a very low level (beginning, for example, with 6.25 mg metoprolol daily). An on-going, international, multicenter study is intended to clarify which patients with dilated cardiomyopathy may benefit from treatment with beta-receptor blockers. Additionally, further information is anticipated with respect to the complex mechanism of action. Beside the direct cardiac action with blockade of the cardiotoxic effect of the extremely high levels of plasma catecholamines, induction of an upregulation of the down-regulated beta-1-receptors there is attenuation of the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Overall, this leads to interruption of the vicious cycle of maladaption associated with chronic heart failure and its attendant unfavorable vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention. This positive aspect of beta-1-receptor blockade in dilated cardiomyopathy carries with its initially and unavoidable negative inotropic effect and thus, in the individual patient, the net effect is difficult to predict. Consequently, the indication must be established on an individual basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "We analyzed the clinical course of 120 patients who were diagnosed as having primary hypertension and subsequently given standard stepped-care therapy (diuretic, beta-blocker and vasodilator) for 9 years. At the end of the follow-up period, 21 patients (17.5%) had developed overt proteinuria. The initial study showed no difference in systolic blood pressure, age, sex, serum creatinine and its clearance, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides between these patients and those who had not become proteinuric, but uric acid levels and diastolic blood pressure were higher (both P less than 0.01). An adequate control of blood pressure was obtained and maintained in all patients, who had similar therapeutic needs. During the follow-up period, uric acid levels remained significantly elevated (P less than 0.01) in the proteinuric patients, while changes in serum glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides were similar in all patients. These results indicate that long-term treatment of primary hypertensives does not fully protect kidney function and that initially elevated uric acid levels could be a predictor of a poor prognosis.", 
    "4": "Considering the long-term effects of the commonly used antihypertensive agents, there appear to be no apparent adverse effects with calcium antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The literature available concerning the effects of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers is extensive and rather confusing. In the case of thiazide diuretics, a review of the literature indicates that in the short-term (therapy for less than six months) thiazide diuretics induce a rise in total cholesterol, total triglycerides and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, with a possible fall in high density lipoprotein (HDL). If this was translated into long-term effects it could be associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease. However, the long-term effects (therapy for more than six months) are unclear. Several large-scale trials of antihypertensive therapy using diuretics have suggested that the use of diuretics may have reduced the rate of decline of cholesterol levels which would otherwise have occurred. The literature on the effects of beta-blockers on blood lipids and lipoproteins is extensive and conflicting. The most consistent finding is a rise in triglycerides and there is some evidence that this may be due to the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. Some authors have found an associated fall in total HDL cholesterol. However, analysis of the effects on the main HDL subfractions (HDL2 and HDL3) show an increase in HDL2 and a decrease in HDL3, which may counteract the possibly detrimental reduction in total HDL. Since triglyceride levels have only weak relationship to atherosclerotic risk it seems unlikely that beta-blockers significantly increase this risk.", 
    "5": "As beta-adrenoreceptor blockers have been shown to reduce mortality following myocardial infarction by around 20%, a similar pattern of 'cardioprotection' was looked for in hypertensive patients. Several non-randomised retrospective studies have suggested that beta-blockers may reduce either the mortality or morbidity from vascular complications. In the three randomised studies published to date, the effect of beta-blockers was compared with other managements using the technique of meta-analysis or overview. The overall mortality rate ratio in hypertensive patients treated with beta-blockers compared with those receiving placebo or diuretic treatment was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.1). The pooled rate ratio for coronary heart disease (CHD) events was 0.95 and for cerebrovascular accidents 0.92. When beta-blockers were compared with diuretics, the overall pooled mortality rate ratio was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.1). The pooled rate ratios for CHD events and cerebrovascular disease events were 0.98 and 1.22, respectively. These results raise the possibility that, in hypertensive patients, treatment with beta-blockers is associated with a small reduction in overall mortality when compared with other treatments.", 
    "6": "Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (beta-blockers) first came into clinical use 25 years ago. Initially, propranolol was the only beta-blocker available but a number of others, similar in chemical composition and action, became available in the following 10 years. Most blocked both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors and differed only in that some possessed membrane stabilising activity and some were partial agonists. These properties, which were the only pharmacological differences between many beta-blockers, were not found to be clinically very relevant. The main problems associated with the use of beta-blockers were caused by their unwanted effects on beta 2-receptors. The potential to prevent sympathetically-mediated bronchodilatation and thereby cause bronchospasm was, and is, the adverse effect causing most concern. The advent of relatively beta 1-selective beta-blockers, in particular metoprolol and atenolol, made it possible to achieve the therapeutic benefits of beta 1-blockade whilst reducing the unwanted effects of beta 2-blockade; which, in addition to causing less bronchospasm, also meant less impact on arterial vasodilatation and insulin, glucose and free fatty acid release. Unfortunately, beta 1-selective drugs reduce, but do not eliminate, the unwanted effects of beta 2-blockade and the larger the dose and the higher the plasma and tissue concentrations, the greater the effect on beta 2-receptor sites. Drugs which may act as beta-blockers at beta 1-receptor sites whilst having some, albeit mild, stimulatory action at beta 2-receptors are now available.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "We investigated the fluctuations which underly the spontaneous variability of blood pressure and heart rate in conscious rats. Intrafemoral blood pressure was computed to generate evenly spaced signals (systolic, diastolic, mean blood pressure, heart rate) at 200 ms intervals. This equidistant sampling allowed a direct spectral analysis using a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate exhibited low-frequency oscillations (Mayer waves, 20-605 mHz) and a high- frequency oscillation related to respiration (1855 mHz). The respiratory fluctuations in heart rate were almost abolished by vagal blockade (atropine). Heart rate fluctuations in the low-frequency regime were diminished by vagal blockade or cardiac sympathetic blockade (atenolol). The respiratory frequency fluctuations in systolic blood pressure were markedly increased by alpha-sympathetic blockade (prazosin). In contrast, the low-frequency oscillations in systolic blood pressure were reduced by alpha-sympathetic blockade. These data indicate that in conscious rats: (1) the heart rate oscillation with respiration is vagally mediated; (2) the heart rate fluctuation in the low-frequency range is jointly mediated by beta-sympathetic and parasympathetic activities; (3) the respiratory oscillation in systolic blood pressure depends on fluctuations in cardiac output and is normally counteracted by the sympathetic tone; (4) the low-frequency oscillations in systolic blood pressure reflect the sympathetic activity to the resistance vessels.", 
    "8": "beta-Blockers are effective in reducing the blood pressure of many patients with systemic hypertension. They differ in terms of the presence or absence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, membrane-stabilising activity, beta 1-selectivity, alpha-blocking properties, and relative potency and duration of action. All beta-blockers appear to have blood pressure lowering effects. The choice of which beta-blocker to use in an individual patient is determined by the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences between the drugs in conjunction with the patient's other medical condition(s). This review discusses the practical use of beta-blockers and provides rational suggestions for which drug(s) to use in selected patient groups (Black, elderly, postinfarction, diabetes, renal disease, obstructive lung disease, elevated lipid levels, coexisting angina, and left ventricular hypertrophy).", 
    "9": "To determine the effects of parasympathetic blockade and beta-blockade on the elastic response of aortic stiffness to vasopressive interventions, we studied 5 unanesthetised adult mongrel dogs by means of a pressure microtransducer and two ultrasonic crystals positioned at opposing sites in the proximal descending thoracic aorta which were used for diameter measurements. Systolic and diastolic changes in pressure and diameter were used to calculate Peterson and incremental elastic moduli. Acute hypertension was induced using infusions of epinephrine during the control period and later propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) plus atropine (0.2 mg/kg). Percent variations of mean aortic diameter were correlated to percent variations in mean aortic pressure in the control period and after autonomic blockade (P less than .001). The slopes of these correlations in the control group were higher than after autonomic blockade (P less than .05). Correlations were also found between Peterson and incremental elastic moduli and mean pressure in the control group and after autonomic blockade (P less than .001). The slopes of the correlations of incremental elastic modulus and Peterson's modulus versus mean aortic pressure were lower in the control group than after blockade (P less than .001). We conclude that in conscious dogs, autonomic blockade with propranolol and atropine decreased the distension and increased the stiffness of the aortic wall in response to acute hypertension mediated by epinephrine.", 
    "10": "The effect of a carbohydrate-rich meal on subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow was studied with and without continuous i.v. infusion of propranolol in healthy volunteers. The subcutaneous adipose tissue blood flow was measured with the 133Xe washout method in three different locations: the forearm, the thigh and the abdomen. The subjects were given a meal consisting of white bread, jam, honey and apple juice (about 2300 kJ). The meal induced a twofold increase in blood flow in the examined tissues. Propranolol abolished the flow increase in the thigh and the abdomen and reduced it in the forearm. This indicates that the mechanism for the flow increase is elicited by a stimulation of vascular beta-adrenoceptors in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, since the beta-adrenoceptor inhibition did not affect the overall metabolic and hormonal responses to the meal.", 
    "11": "To study the influence of ischemic zone size on function in nonischemic regions, wall thickening and the end-systolic pressure-thickness (ESPTR) relationship were measured before and during a 90-s coronary occlusion, which produced either a small or large (24 or 35% of left ventricular mass) area of ischemia. With both size ischemic areas, nonischemic zone isovolumic and ejection phase wall thickening increased during occlusion, primarily because of increased preload and, to a lesser extent, a reduced pressure component of afterload. The nonischemic region ESPTR was unchanged from preocclusion control with small ischemic mass. With larger ischemic mass, the nonischemic region ESPTR was shifted downward and to the left, indicating reduced end-systolic performance. The decline in the nonischemic zone ESPTR with large ischemic zone size was not due to reduced blood flow, shortening deactivation, reflex effects, or \"tethering\" but rather to the associated decline in coronary perfusion pressure. Thus the increase of nonischemic region wall thickening during acute ischemia is due to a change in ventricular loading conditions and not augmentation of contractile performance. Larger ischemic zone size can impair function in nonischemic myocardium by reducing the erectile component of end-systolic performance.", 
    "12": "The effects of acute hypoglycemia on the heart and cardiovascular system were examined in humans using radioisotopic techniques, complemented by measurement of heart rate and blood pressure. The heart rate increased from 62 +/- 3 to 87 +/- 3 beats/min in response to hypoglycemia; this increase was accompanied by a significant increase in systolic blood pressure, a fall in diastolic blood pressure, with no change in the mean arterial blood pressure. The left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 47 +/- 3 (SE) to 72 +/- 5% in response to hypoglycemia. The increases in heart rate and ejection fraction were abolished during parenteral nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol but were unaffected by either alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine or cholinergic blockade with atropine. During beta-adrenergic blockade, there were significant increases in diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure in response to hypoglycemia. During alpha-adrenergic blockade the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures fell significantly after hypoglycemia. The blood pressure responses to hypoglycemia were unaffected by cholinergic blockade. Thus the increases in ejection fraction and in heart rate in response to hypoglycemia are mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors, whereas the blood pressure responses to hypoglycemia are mediated by alpha- and by beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "13": "The influence that drug size has on the rate of recovery of sodium channels in heart tissue has been reexamined. A drug dimension that looks at the end-on view of the molecule provides a substantially better explanation for the size dependence of repriming kinetics than does molecular weight. A quantitative model for the recovery time is provided that couples proton exchange kinetics with a drug size-dependent process that is related to recovery from inactivation. Drugs having a wider span at their aromatic end produce more slowing of the rate of recovery from inactivation.", 
    "14": "Experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanism underlying our recent observation that reserpine but not surgical denervation up-regulates rat renal cortical beta adrenergic receptors. The specific binding of [125I]iodocyanopindolol was used to quantitate the beta adrenoceptors. Chronic high-dose guanethidine, which decreased renal tissue and circulating catecholamines to the same extent as reserpine, failed to up-regulate renal beta adrenoceptors, which indicates that the effect of reserpine was not due to changes in the ambient catecholamine concentration. Isoproterenol-stimulated renin secretion, a measure of postsynaptic receptor function, was increased by reserpine but not denervation, which indicates that the failure to observe beta adrenoceptor up-regulation by radioligand binding studies after denervation was not an anomaly caused by loss of presynaptic receptors masking postsynaptic supersensitivity. Reserpine was effective even in denervated kidneys. Up-regulation of renal beta adrenoceptors with reserpine occurred even after destruction of peripheral sympathetic nervous system by a combination of adrenal demedullation and high-dose guanethidine administration. A lower daily dose of reserpine (0.3 mg/kg instead of 0.5 mg/kg), which caused no weight loss, was effective in producing beta adrenoceptor up-regulation. Antagonism of reserpine depletion of nerve terminal norepinephrine by tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, did not nullify renal beta adrenoceptor up-regulation. Overall, our results indicate that reserpine up-regulation of renal beta adrenergic receptors is independent of the sympathetic nervous system and possibly is a direct effect.", 
    "15": "Cardiovascular and pulmonary responses to endothelin (ET)-1, ET-3 and neuropeptide Y (NPY) were investigated in the anesthetized cat. ET-1, 0.1 to 1 nmol/kg i.v., decreased or elicited biphasic changes in arterial pressure (AP), whereas ET-3, in the same doses, decreased AP. Both ETs increased cardiac output (CO) and, at the highest doses, a secondary decrease in CO was observed. NPY, 0.3 to 3 nmol/kg i.v., increased AP and at the highest dose decreased CO. All three peptides had inconsistent effects on right ventricular contractile force and increased central venous pressure. ET-1 at lower doses increased heart rate (HR) and, at 1 nmol/kg, caused a biphasic change. ET-3 increased HR, whereas NPY decreased HR. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) was increased by NPY and decreased by ET-3, whereas ET-1 elicited biphasic changes. ET-1 and ET-3 increased pulmonary arterial pressure, left atrial pressure and caused biphasic changes in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). NPY had no significant effect on PAP or PVR. When pulmonary blood flow was maintained constant, ET-1 and ET-3 had only pulmonary vasoconstrictor activity, whereas NPY and the ET analog had no significant effect. The increase in SVR in response to NPY, the decrease in response to ET-3 or the biphasic change in response to ET-1 were not modified by meclofenamate, hexamethonium or propranolol. Increases in HR in response to ET-1 and ET-3 were reduced by the beta receptor and ganglionic blocking agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "We developed a new angiographic score of the extent of coronary disease (extent score), which we compared with conventional stenosis and vessel scores that emphasize the severity of stenosis. Scores were determined in 132 patients (29 women, 103 men with a mean age of 55 +/- 10 years) who underwent elective coronary angiography. Risk factors were more closely related to the extent score than to either the stenosis or vessel scores (Total R2 = 0.35 versus 0.28 (p less than 0.001) and 0.25 (p less than 0.001), respectively). The extent score was more closely related to age (r = 0.30, p less than 0.05), than was either stenosis (r = 0.21 ns) or vessel score (r = 0.26, p less than 0.05). Apolipoprotein B was the strongest predictor of both extent and stenosis scores but was more closely related to the extent score (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), even after correction for age and gender. This new angiographic score that assesses the extent of coronary disease is simple to perform and correlates better with age and lipoprotein risk factors than conventional scores do.", 
    "17": "When combining a beta blocker with a diuretic in patients with hypertension, consideration should be given to the potential advantages of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA). During long-term administration of a beta blocker without ISA, total peripheral resistance stabilizes at or slightly above the pretreatment level. Since cardiac output is decreased, blood pressure falls. Thus, beta blockers without ISA may exacerbate the underlying haemodynamic abnormality of long-standing hypertension, increased systemic resistance. In contrast, the reduction in pressure which occurs with a beta blocker possessing a high degree of ISA, such as pindolol, is associated with a reduction in total peripheral resistance and little change in cardiac output. Thiazide diuretics and most beta blockers without ISA also have an adverse impact on the blood lipid profile, potentially increasing cardiovascular risk. With the exception of oxprenolol, monotherapy with beta blockers which possess ISA have generally had no adverse blood lipid changes. Indeed, pindolol has been shown to increase HDL-cholesterol and to reduce the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol. Pindolol administered in combination with several diuretics has not increased the adverse lipid effects of these agents and, in some studies, evidence suggests that pindolol may counteract some or all of these changes. The clinical significance of these differences between beta blockers with and without ISA remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the potential haemodynamic and metabolic benefit of agents with ISA mandate that they receive careful consideration when selecting a beta blocker to administer with a diuretic.", 
    "18": "We determined the relative contribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation to the positive inotropic responses of human atrial myocardium to catecholamines. (-)Norepinephrine produced stimulation predominantly through beta 1-receptors and (-)epinephrine through both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors. However, there were marked differences in the responses of tissues from patients treated with the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol compared with non-beta-blocker-treated patients; surprisingly, beta 2-mediated responses were enhanced, and beta 1-mediated responses were unaltered. There was an enhanced responsiveness to (-)epinephrine (atenolol treated: -log M EC50, 7.57 +/- 0.07; non-beta-blocker treated: -log M EC50, 6.77 +/- 0.17; p less than 0.001), and the relative importance of beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation was increased for both (-)norepinephrine and (-)epinephrine. In tissues from atenolol-treated patients, salbutamol, a beta 2-selective partial agonist, had an enhanced potency and a greater intrinsic activity (atenolol treated: -log M EC50, 7.13 +/- 0.09; intrinsic activity, 0.86 +/- 0.04; non-beta-blocker treated: -log M EC50, 5.76 +/- 0.44; intrinsic activity, 0.39 +/- 0.13). We investigated possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced responsiveness to beta 2 stimulation. Determination of beta 2-adrenoceptor affinity for salbutamol showed no change of affinity in atenolol-treated patients. Responses of the tissues to the cyclic AMP analogue dibutyryl cyclic AMP were not different between atenolol-treated and non-beta-blocker-treated patients. The results suggest that chronic blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors causes enhanced coupling of beta 2-adrenoceptors to adenylate cyclase or to other mechanisms leading to increased contractile force.", 
    "19": "This study evaluated the effects of transient coronary occlusion on the diameter of a nonischemic vessel or a nonischemic coronary segment proximal to the site of occlusion. Awake mongrel dogs chronically instrumented with dimension crystals, Doppler flow probes, and distal pneumatic occluders on the circumflex coronary arteries were subjected to transient 2-minute circumflex occlusions (n = 9) under constant heart rate (120 beats/min). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased by 60% (from 10 +/- 1 to 16 +/- 2 mm Hg), and dP/dt decreased by 8% (from 2,048 +/- 130 to 1,885 +/- 110 mm Hg/sec); systemic hemodynamics were unaltered. Epicardial coronary diameter proximal to the site of occlusion decreased by 4.37% (from 3.62 +/- 0.25 to 3.46 +/- 0.29 mm, p less than 0.05). Constriction began 15-20 seconds after the onset of ischemia and progressed to maximum in 1-2 minutes. Combined alpha- and beta-receptor blockade (n = 8) with phentolamine (2 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg) or cyclooxygenase inhibition (n = 5) with indomethacin (7.5 mg/kg) did not attenuate the ischemia-induced vasoconstriction response. Transient 2-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 6) also elicited significant epicardial vasoconstriction in the circumflex coronary artery in the first minute (from 3.88 +/- 0.31 to 3.81 +/- 0.31 mm, p less than 0.05); the constriction was attenuated subsequently by an increase (25.5%) in circumflex flow. When left anterior descending occlusion was repeated (n = 6) with circumflex flow held constant, the ischemia-induced circumflex constriction was augmented; diameter decreased 3.7% (from 3.83 +/- 0.29 to 3.69 +/- 0.29 mm, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "21": "The vasovagal nature of syncope, which remained unexplained despite full clinical and electrophysiologic investigation, was evaluated by means of 60 degrees head-up tilt test for 60 minutes. Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women, mean age 65 years, 19 with and 11 without organic heart disease) with 1 to 28 (mean 5) episodes of syncope of unknown origin were studied. Head-up tilt test was considered positive if syncope developed in association with hypotension, bradycardia, or both. During baseline head-up tilt 15 patients (50%) had a positive response. Ten patients had a vasodepressor response (marked hypotension without marked bradycardia) and 5 had a mixed response (marked hypotension with marked bradycardia). None of 8 control subjects became symptomatic during the test. Baseline head-up tilt test was positively reproducible in 10 of 14 patients (71%). Nine of these 10 patients underwent serial head-up tilt tests after drug administration to determine the pathogenesis of vasovagal syncope. Atropine prevented tilt-induced syncope in 3 of 8 patients (37.5%), propranolol in 2 of 8 (25%) and etilephrine in 7 of 7 (100%). Seven patients received long-term drug treatment with drugs selected on the basis of acute drug testing. One responder to atropine received transdermal scopolamine and 6 received etilephrine. None of these 7 patients had syncopal recurrences or death during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Head-up tilt is a very sensitive and highly specific test to unmask susceptibility to vasovagal reaction in patients with syncope of unknown origin. Withdrawal of alpha-sympathetic stimulation is a principal mechanism responsible for vasodilation and syncope during head-up tilt.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Cardiac beta-adrenoceptors and the alpha-subunits of the inhibitory guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (Gi alpha) were determined in myocardial biopsies and in larger samples of explanted hearts from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. The myocardium of one non-failing heart was studied for comparison. There were fewer beta-adrenoceptors in right and left ventricular samples from hearts with dilated cardiomyopathy than in the non-failing myocardium. The number of beta-adrenoceptors determined by equilibrium saturation experiments closely correlated with their density as measured by a saturating concentration of the radioligand 125Iodocyanopindolol in myocardial biopsies. Using the 32P-ADP-ribosylation of a 40kDa membrane protein catalyzed by pertussis toxin, an increase of Gi alpha could also be shown in both myocardial biopsies and explanted hearts.", 
    "23": "The efficacy of oral DL-sotalol in suppressing premature ventricular complexes was assessed by Holter recordings in 28 patients during short term (two weeks) and long term (two years) trials, and its beta-adrenergic blocking effects were evaluated by heart rate response to the Bruce treadmill stress test and plasma catecholamine increases upon active standing. Sotalol produced a significant decrease (more than 85%) in the number of premature ventricular complexes, during both short term (54%) of patients) and long term (39% of patients) trials. The doses employed in this study (320 mg/day) produced mild to moderate degrees of beta-adrenergic blockade as suggested by: a 20% reduction in the mean heart rate on 48 h Holter monitoring (P less than 0.0005); a 15 to 30% reduction in tachycardia induced by strenuous exercise; and a 12% reduction in standing-induced tachycardia. Under long term sotalol therapy the increase in plasma noradrenaline concentrations in response to active standing was not modified, but the increase in plasma adrenaline concentrations was greater than under baseline conditions (P less than 0.025). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures significantly increased during long term sotalol administration (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.025, respectively). However, blood pressure remained within the normotensive range during sotalol therapy. It was concluded that sotalol provides, at effective antiarrhythmic doses, a satisfactory level of beta-adrenergic blockade which during standing was associated with significant changes in adrenaline plasma increments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "The mechanism of action of the beta-receptor antagonist bucindolol was examined in human ventricular myocardium. Bucindolol was found to be a high-affinity competitive beta-blocking agent as determined by bucindolol-[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) competition curves (KI = 3.7 +/- 1.3 x 10(-9) M, n = 10). This value was in general agreement with bucindolol KB's, determined by antagonism of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (KB = 2.8 +/- 0.55 x 10(-9) M, n = 5) or isoproterenol-augmented contraction of right ventricular trabeculae (KB = 2.9 +/- 1.9 x 10(-9) M, n = 3). In contrast, the alpha 1-receptor KI, determined at bucindolol-125IBE2254 (IBE) competition binding in rat cardiac membranes, was 1.2 x 10(-7) M. Bucindolol exhibited no beta 1- or beta 2-receptor subtype selectivity as deduced from blockade of the beta-agonist-coupled adenylate cyclase system, receptor-binding studies with preparations of human ventricular myocardium with predominantly beta 1 or beta 2 receptors, or receptor-binding studies in model systems consisting of beta 1 (guinea pig myocardial membranes) or beta 2 receptors (human mononuclear and frog myocardial membranes). In membranes derived from human ventricular myocardium and human lymphocytes, bucindolol recognized a high-affinity agonist-binding site as determined by guanine nucleotide modulation of competition-binding curves. Although bucindolol has measurable intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) in some animal systems, no increase in adenylate cyclase activity or muscle contraction was detected in preparations of human heart. In conclusion, bucindolol is a high-affinity nonselective beta-receptor antagonist with no evidence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity in human ventricular myocardium.", 
    "25": "Forty-five patients with mild hypertension were treated for 2 months with either metoprolol or pindolol in a randomized, blind, crossover study. The effects of metoprolol (100-300 mg/day) and pindolol (5-15 mg/day) on triglyceride (TG), cholesterol (C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and HDL subfraction (HDL2-C and HDL3-C) levels were compared in males and females separately. Pindolol and metoprolol significantly elevated (10% above baseline level) the plasma TG level in both males and females. After metoprolol treatment, the HDL-C level remained unchanged in both sexes; however, a shift was found between HDL2-C and HDL3-C:HDL2-C decreased and a concomitant elevation in HDL3-C was observed. Pindolol significantly decreased total C, HDL-C, and HDL2-C levels in males. A similar trend (although the changes were not significant) was found in females. The results demonstrate the role of beta blockers in the inhibition of TG-rich lipoprotein elimination. These findings suggest that during long-term administration of metoprolol and pindolol, risks and benefits from beta-blocker therapy must be carefully considered. Continuous monitoring of lipid profiles is suggested during this treatment in order to avoid the potential worsening effect of beta blockers on risk factors of ischemic heart disease.", 
    "26": "Labeling studies of Torpedo marmorata nicotinic acetylcholine receptor with the noncompetitive channel blocker [3H]chlorpromazine have led to the initial identification of amino acids plausibly participating to the walls of the ion channel on the alpha, beta, and delta subunits. We report here results obtained with the gamma subunit, which bring additional information on the structure of the channel. After photolabeling of the membrane-bound receptor under equilibrium conditions in the presence of agonist and with or without phencyclidine (a specific ligand for the high-affinity site for noncompetitive blockers), the purified labeled gamma subunit was digested with trypsin, and the resulting fragments were fractionated by HPLC. Sequence analysis of peptide mixtures containing various amounts of highly hydrophobic fragments showed that three amino acids are labeled by [3H]chlorpromazine in a phencyclidine-sensitive manner: Thr-253, Ser-257, and Leu-260. These residues all belong to the hydrophobic and putative transmembrane region MII of the gamma subunit. Their distribution along the sequence is consistent with an alpha-helical organization of this segment. The [3H]chlorpromazine-labeled amino acids are conserved at homologous positions in the known sequences of other ligand-gated ion channels and may, thus, play a critical role in ion-transport mechanisms.", 
    "27": "Members of the American Thyroid Association were invited to participate in a survey of the management of Graves' disease. One primary case and several variations were provided, which differed in respect to age, sex, goiter size, severity, etc. The questionnaire was based on the format used in a similar survey of members of the European Thyroid Association. The aim of the survey was to determine 1) how expert thyroidologist employ diagnostic procedures for this disorder, and 2) the choice of therapy of the three treatment options and its manner of implementation. Questionnaires were sent only to clinically active members. The overall response rate was 62%. Data analysis was possible on 52% of members surveyed and was performed using SPSS and a specific Fortran program. In the laboratory evaluation of the primary case a radioiodine uptake, scan, serum total T4, and basal TSH were requested by 92%, 47%, 83%, and 66%, respectively, with 84% of respondents using an ultrasensitive TSH assay. For management of the primary case, radioiodine treatment was the first choice of 69% of the respondents. Antithyroid drugs were used briefly (3-7 days) before 131I by 28%, whereas 41% said they would employ thioureas after 131I. Of those using 131I, 66% tailored the dose to achieve euthyroidism as the goal of therapy, while 34% aimed for hypothyroidism requiring T4 replacement. Only 30% of respondents chose thioureas as a first line of treatment (72% propylthiouracil; 28% tapazole). The duration of drug therapy was a predetermined fixed interval for 80% of the respondents, with 90% treating for 1-2 yr. Other specific trends in diagnostic approach and therapeutic preferences were identified for the eight variations on the primary case problem.", 
    "28": "Pulmonary artery rings were prepared from rats (group I to VI, n = 5-7 per group) in order to investigate if a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist interferes with the effect of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade. In I, four cumulative noradrenaline (NA) dose-response curves (10(-9) to 10(-3) M) were constructed. In II, NA curves were constructed first, without blockers, then in the presence of phentolamine (10(-6) M), then propranolol (10(-8) M), then phentolamine plus propranolol (10(-8) M). III, IV and V were treated similar to II, except that atenolol (10(-8) M), ICI 118,551 (10(-8) M) and propranolol (10(-6) M), respectively, were added instead of propranolol (10(-8) M). In VI, NA (10(-6) M) was added followed by phentolamine and then propranolol (10(-9) to 10(-6) M). Phentolamine shifted the NA curve to the right with an increase in the EC50 value. Propranolol but not atenolol or ICI 118,551, reduced the elevated EC50 values caused by phentolamine. In group VI, the increase in force by NA was reduced by phentolamine; the effect of phentolamine was completely abolished by propranolol. Thus, propranolol interferes with the effect of phentolamine in the rat pulmonary artery.", 
    "29": "We sought to characterize regional heterogeneity of astrocytes using adrenergic receptor sites as cellular markers. Primary cultures made from 6 regions of neonatal rat brain consisted almost exclusively of astrocytes. Membranes from astrocytes cultured 1-3 weeks were prepared for radioligand binding assays of beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic sites using the ligands [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]p-aminoclonidine, respectively. Receptor expression was not affected by time in culture. Astrocytes from different brain regions varied up to 3-fold with respect to number but not affinity for both classes of adrenergic binding site with a rank order of cerebral cortex = superior colliculus greater than hippocampus = ventral midbrain greater than or equal to caudate nucleus greater than or equal to hypothalamus. Binding to beta- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors was positively correlated across brain regions. Astrocytic receptor binding in each region did not correspond to total receptor levels assessed by quantitative autoradiography. We conclude that: (a) astrocytes are markedly heterogeneous between major brain regions with respect to expression of adrenergic binding sites; (b) regional variations in the density of adrenergic binding sites in brain reflect, in part, local specialization of astrocytes; and (c) a substantial proportion of the adrenergic binding sites in some brain regions may be on astrocytes.", 
    "30": "In the course of four weeks, tetraparesis developed in a 28-year-old man with Crohn's disease for the last six years, treated with glucocorticoids and sulphasalazine. The cause was acute intermittent porphyria which had been previously overlooked because of the similar abdominal symptoms of Crohn's disease. Treatment with glucose, propranolol and haemarginate failed to bring about any improvement, but there was a remission of the porphyria. This case demonstrates that diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria in the presence of Crohn's disease is difficult, and if delayed therapeutic measures in the face of persisting neurological complications are of little benefit.", 
    "31": "We studied exercise training combined with the use of antihypertensive drugs and examined the following questions. (1) Are there additive antihypertensive benefits with exercise and drug therapy combined? (2) Does drug therapy limit exercise-induced lipid improvements? (3) Does exercise that includes weight training and walking/jogging affect the left ventricle? Fifty-two hypertensive men were randomly assigned, double-blind, to diltiazem hydrochloride, sustained release (360 mg daily), propranolol hydrochloride (240 mg daily), or placebo and exercised three times per week for 10 weeks. Baseline blood pressure (145/97 mm Hg) fell after training (131/84 mm Hg) in all groups. Exercise decreased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in all groups. Increases in the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar in placebo and diltiazem groups, whereas the propranolol group changed in an opposite direction. In all groups, left ventricular mass increased with training, while diastolic function was unchanged. We conclude that (1) drug therapy provided no additive benefit to the antihypertensive effects of exercise, (2) propranolol limited improvements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and (3) exercise did not adversely affect the left ventricle.", 
    "32": "The cost effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy is increasingly called into question. Minimising the prescribed dose of antihypertensive medications is one potentially effective method of improving cost effectiveness. The minimum effective dose of an antihypertensive medication is defined as that dose above which any further increase is unlikely to result in significant additional lowering of blood pressure. A review of the available clinical trials was undertaken to determine the minimum effective dosages for commonly prescribed beta blockers. These minimum effective dosages were then compared with the average dosages currently prescribed in New Zealand general practices, as determined by a random national survey of prescriptions. The comparison indicated that several beta blockers--including atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and oxprenolol--are probably being prescribed at excessively high doses. These findings were supported by the results of a general practice based prospective study of beta blocker dose reduction. Seventy-three hypertensive patients on a range of beta blockers were monitored for three months, following a halving of their medication dosage. The results of this study indicated that despite 50% reduction in dosage, there was no loss of antihypertensive effect in this patient population, although heart rate increased. Together, these two studies demonstrate the clinical relevance of the concept of a minimum dosage for beta blockers. A strategy is outlined for reducing the doses for several beta blockers in a significant proportion of hypertensive patients with major cost savings.", 
    "33": "Recent research indicates that neurohormonal responses after myocardial infarction may predict patient outcome, and alteration of this process may change etiologic factors and strengthen positive prognosticators. Because there are clinical similarities between acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, there appears to be justification for a unified treatment approach (i.e., therapies that have proved beneficial in the treatment of myocardial infarction have also showed promise in the treatment of heart failure). Conversely, some therapies that have benefited the patient with heart failure may benefit the patient who has had a myocardial infarction. For example, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been proven to blunt detrimental neurohormonal activity seen after myocardial infarction. These therapies promise to reduce complications and improve survival.", 
    "34": "Propranolol inhibited cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation stimulated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) or forskolin in rat parotid acinar cells. The inhibition by propranolol was highly potent; 10(-7) M propranolol was sufficient for the maximum inhibition (approx. 50% at 5 min). The inhibitory effect was observed in both intact and saponin-permeabilized parotid cells, but the effect was more prominent in permeabilized cells than in intact cells. Other beta-blockers, like alprenolol and atenolol, were as effective as propranolol, but butoxamine (beta 2-selective) was slightly less effective. The inhibition by propranolol was similarly detected in the cells prepared from pertussis-toxin-pretreated rats, suggesting that inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Gi) is not involved in the inhibitory mechanism. Propranolol also inhibited the exocytosis of amylase stimulated by IBMX or forskolin. In the presence of propranolol and IBMX, the responsiveness of saponin-permeabilized cells to exogenous cAMP was markedly increased, indicating that propranolol neither promotes the degradation of cAMP nor prevents the inhibitory effect of IBMX on cAMP phosphodiesterase.", 
    "35": "To examine the effects of growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) on islet hormone release, rat pancreas was perfused. rhGRF at the concentration of 10(-7) M or more enhanced insulin secretion stimulated by 16.7 mM glucose, hpGRF slightly enhanced insulin secretion as well. The insulin secretion induced by 10(-6) M rhGRF was completely inhibited by 10(-6) M propranolol. rhGRF at the concentration of 10(-8) M or more stimulated glucagon secretion even in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose. The glucagon secretion stimulated by 10(-6) M rhGRF was inhibited in the early period but increased thereafter by 10(-6) M propranolol. 10(-6) M rhGRF slightly stimulated glucagon secretion in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose when STZ diabetic rat pancreas was perfused. rhGRF at the concentration of 10(-6) M enhanced somatostatin secretion stimulated with 16.7 mM glucose. We concluded that rhGRF stimulated insulin, glucagon and somatostatin secretion and the insulin secretion was inhibited by beta-blocker. hpGRF stimulated insulin and glucagon secretion as well.", 
    "36": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described, which allows the simultaneous quantification of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol enantiomers in human plasma. After extraction from plasma (pH 10.5) using ethyl acetate, the enantiomers are derivatized with R-(+)-phenylethylisocyanate as chiral derivatization reagent and triethylamine as basic catalyst in chloroform. Ascorbic acid is used to prevent 4-hydroxypropranolol from oxidation during the extraction. Chromatographic separation on ODS columns and fluorescence detection (228 nm/greater than 340 nm) allows sensitive quantitation of all derivatives. Incubation of the plasma samples with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase and the use of the specific beta-glucuronidase inhibitor saccharo-1,4-lactone allows the quantitation of both the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of the enantiomers. The method was applied to human plasma samples from a subject after administration of 60 mg racemic propranolol three times daily.", 
    "37": "Improvements in a multidimensional liquid chromatography system for the direct determination of drug substances in blood plasma are reported. The system employs an on-line micellar chromatographic cleanup followed by a reversed-phase analytical separation. The limit of detection of propranolol is improved by a factor 10 compared to previously reported work. The technique is applied towards the determination of a multicomponent mixture of tricyclic anti-depressants in blood plasma. A protocol for optimization is described.", 
    "38": "Transmural nerve stimulation of isolated atria, obtained from reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs, in the presence of atropine and the beta 1-adrenoceptor-blocking drug CGP 20712A, induced a positive inotropic effect. [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAGO), [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), morphine and dynorphin dose dependently reduced the cardiac response to transmural nerve stimulation. The delta receptor selective agonist [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), and the kappa receptor agonist, U50488, were unable modify the response. The inhibitory effect of all the active opioid agonists was antagonized by naloxone but not by the selective delta and kappa opioid receptor antagonists, ICI 174.864 and MR 2266. These results suggest the presence on sensory nerve terminals of inhibitory opioid receptors belonging to the mu, but not to the delta and kappa subtypes.", 
    "39": "The effect of ganglion blockade by hexamethonium bromide (0.1-100 mumol.kg-1) and pentolinium tartrate (0.01-3 mumol.kg-1) on the bronchoconstriction induced by vagal nerve stimulation (15 Hz, 0.2 ms, 3 s, 7-20 V) was evaluated in the anaesthetized guinea-pig. Both ganglion-blocking agents potentiated this response dose dependently. When the neural bronchoconstriction was suppressed by atropine, hexamethonium restored this response dose dependently. Hexamethonium produced inhibitory effects on vagally induced bronchoconstriction in capsaicin-desensitized and in propranolol- or reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs. Propranolol (0.03-3 mumol.kg-1) produced a marked dose-dependent increase of neural bronchoconstriction (which was markedly reduced, about 10 times) in capsaicin-desensitized animals. Our results show that ganglion-blocking agents potentiate neural bronchoconstriction in the guinea-pig and that sensory neuropeptides may have a role in this effect. Moreover, beta-adrenergic modulation of the release of neuropeptides from vagal sensory fibers is suggested.", 
    "40": "To evaluate the effects of exercise testing, training and beta blockade on serum potassium, 40 normal subjects (24 men, 16 women, mean age 33 years) had 4 maximal exercise tests with venipuncture for serum potassium before and less than or equal to 40 seconds after each test. After initial exercise testing, they were randomized to atenolol 50 mg daily, atenolol 100 mg daily, propranolol 80 mg twice daily or placebo. All began a 9-week dynamic exercise program for 8 weeks followed by a 1-week drug-free washout period. Tests were done after weeks 1, 8 and 9. A significant mean increase (p less than 0.05) in serum potassium occurred with maximal exercise in the atenolol 50 mg and propranolol groups after 1 week of treatment (mean +/- standard deviation, 4.78 +/- 0.29 to 5.09 +/- 0.43 mEq/liter and 4.81 +/- 0.55 to 5.30 +/- 0.33 mEq/liter). By week 8 after training, all beta blockade groups showed an increase in postmaximal exercise test serum potassium (atenolol 50 mg, 4.78 +/- 0.29 to 5.11 +/- 0.26 mEq/liter; atenolol 100 mg, 4.95 +/- 0.41 to 5.16 +/- 0.36 mEq/liter; propranolol, 4.81 +/- 0.55 to 5.05 +/- 0.29 mEq/liter). After washout, only the placebo group showed an increase in postmaximal test serum potassium (4.99 +/- 0.46 to 5.35 +/- 0.27 mEq/liter). Data indicate that hyperkalemia with maximal exercise testing increases after training with atenolol and propranolol compared to placebo and that this effect resolves once treatment is discontinued.", 
    "41": "Rabbits underwent the single-dose or long-term therapeutic administration of the adrenergic drugs phenylephrine hydrochloride, timolol maleate, and betaxolol hydrochloride. After a single dose, all three drugs caused substantial, localized constriction in the arterioles that supply the ciliary processes but did not affect the downstream bore of the same vessels. After seven weeks of a daily dose, tolerance reduced the response to betaxolol to insignificant levels and that to phenylephrine substantially, whereas timolol maleate continued to produce identical levels of vasoconstriction to those seen with single-dose administration. In addition to the consequent lowering of perfusion of the ciliary processes and presumptive impact on aqueous humor production, vasoconstriction also reinforces concerns about impaired vascular perfusion of eyes undergoing long-term ocular therapy.", 
    "42": "Studies using isolated cell membranes have shown that beta-adrenergic receptors exist in two interconvertible conformations, one with high affinity for agonists and the other with low affinity. Guanine nucleotides and sodium shift high-affinity receptor sites into low-affinity sites. We sought to demonstrate affinity states of the beta-adrenergic receptor in slide-mounted sections of rat and human postmortem brain, and to determine using quantitative receptor autoradiography the regional distribution in the brain of high-affinity receptors relative to the total population of beta-adrenergic receptors. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol inhibited the binding of 125I-iodopindolol to slide-mounted sections of rat forebrain and human premotor cortex in a biphasic manner. Approximately 80% of the beta-receptor sites in both rat and human brain showed high-affinity for isoproterenol (7-14 nM). Treatment with 0.1 mM non-hydrolyzable guanine nucleotide 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate and 25 mM NaCl abolished high-affinity binding in rat brain sections and reduced it in human brain sections. These findings were confirmed by membrane studies using similar tissue samples. For autoradiographic studies, 17 nM isoproterenol displaced 71% of the high-affinity sites without affecting low-affinity beta-adrenergic receptors. Digital subtraction was used to selectively visualize beta-receptors in the high-affinity conformation. The proportion of beta-adrenergic receptors in the high-affinity conformation differed significantly across rat brain regions and across human cortical layers. We conclude that beta-adrenergic affinity states, presumably reflecting the interaction of the receptor with a G-protein, occur in slide-mounted sections of rat brain and persist in human postmortem material.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "The present discussion of SMI is of major impact on physical active coronary patients, since SMI during physical training could represent a potential risk factor. We carried out an investigation in 107 coronary patients of ambulant coronary groups (ACG) on the incidence of SMI during exercise testing and Holter monitoring (HM) including a training unit. With both techniques in approximately 1/3 of the patients SMI could be observed, when coronary medication was omitted. However the concordance of these two positive groups was found to be remarkably low. During HM SMI was found within the training units nearly as frequent as during normal daily life. By beta blockade (100 mg metoprolol) exercise SMI during HM was suppressed in 2/3. Our conclusion was that SMI is not of major significance in pharmacologically well controlled participants in ACG.", 
    "44": "Left ventricular mass sometimes decreases during treatment of hypertension, but this response is inconsistent and its effects on left ventricular function are unknown. In a six-month randomized trial, we studied the ability of verapamil and atenolol to reduce left ventricular mass in 42 elderly patients with hypertension and the effects of this reduction in mass on cardiac function. The mean blood pressure (+/- SE) decreased in both the group that received verapamil (from 171.4 +/- 3.2/93.0 +/- 2.5 mm Hg to 142.9 +/- 2.8/79.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg) and the group that received atenolol (from 179.6 +/- 4.6/98.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg to 148.1 +/- 3.3/83.4 +/- 1.2 mm Hg), but the atenolol-treated patients more frequently required the addition of chlorthalidone to achieve blood-pressure reduction (P less than 0.01). Verapamil resulted in a reduction in the left-ventricular-mass index from 104 +/- 5 g per square meter of body-surface area to 85 +/- 5 g per square meter (P less than 0.01). Atenolol did not produce a reduction in the left-ventricular-mass index (109 +/- 9 g per square meter before treatment vs. 112 +/- 10 g per square meter after treatment). Two weeks after the withdrawal of antihypertensive therapy, blood pressure returned to pretreatment values. Nevertheless, in patients whose left ventricular mass had decreased, two measures of diastolic filling, the peak diastolic filling rate to the peak ejection rate, were significantly higher than before treatment (2.42 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.31 +/- 0.4 [P less than 0.05] and 0.61 +/- 0.03 to 0.85 +/- 0.05 [P less than 0.05], respectively). Diastolic filling was unchanged in the group that had no reduction in left ventricular mass. Cardiac output and the ejection fraction at rest and during mild exercise were unchanged in both groups as compared with baseline values. We conclude that left ventricular mass can be reduced in elderly patients with hypertension and mild ventricular hypertrophy who receive antihypertensive therapy. Reduction occurs more frequently with verapamil than with atenolol therapy, increases diastolic filling, and does not impair systolic function.", 
    "45": "Alcohol withdrawal reveals a condition of central nervous system (CNS) hyperexcitability opposite to that of the primary effect of the drug. Adaption to the decreased activity of the CNS during chronic ethanol ingestion may at least partly explain several of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Benzodiazepines are therefore useful in the withdrawal state. The benzodiazepine loading dose technique, giving diazepam 20 mg every hour until the patient shows signs of clinical improvement and mild sedation, is the choice of treatment in cases of moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal. In general, neuroleptics should be avoided, because of increased risk of convulsions, but haloperidol can be used to control hallucinations and severe agitation. This treatment should then be combined with benzodiazepines. Most patients with mild withdrawal symptoms respond to non-pharmacological supportive care, except for those with a history of withdrawal seizures. These patients may need treatment with carbamazepine or diazepam.", 
    "46": "An effect of the selective beta-adrenergic block with metoprolol and non-selective beta-adrenergic block with propranolol on the hypoglycaemia was investigated in 30 dogs of the control group and 30 dogs with alloxan diabetes. A significant increase in cortisol secretion was seen in the insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in both groups without beta-adrenergic block. It suggests an important role of cortisol in the normalization of glycaemia following an administration of the exogenous insulin. Beta-adrenergic block, especially with metoprolol, produces a significant increase in cortisol secretion confirming the report on direct effect of this beta-adrenolytic agent on cortisol secretion.", 
    "47": "In order to investigate the behaviour of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in untreated mild to moderate essential hypertension and the influence of blood pressure normalisation by a beta 1-receptor blocker a study was conducted in groups of normotensive and hypertensive middle aged subjects. 10 normal subjects and 10 patients with essential hypertension (WHO I-II) without any medication and on betaxolol monotherapy were studied at rest and during graded exercise. In addition the response of ANP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and the renin-aldosterone-system was investigated. Normal subjects and hypertensive patients did not differ in ANP levels at rest and also responded with a comparable exercise dependent increase at all workload levels. A steady decrease of ANP was noticed during the recovery period in both groups. After beta-blocker treatment in the hypertensive patients ANP concentrations significantly rose, both at rest and more pronounced during exercise. cGMP reacted in a similar way but showed a more inert response. A counter-regulatory behaviour between ANP and PRA or aldosterone, as seen under volume shifts, could not be detected. These findings demonstrate that plasma ANP is not altered in untreated essential hypertension. Increased ANP levels in beta 1-blocker treatment may contribute to its blood lowering effect.", 
    "48": "To evaluate the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a low-dose diuretic, indapamide, 2.5 mg once daily, was given to 248 patients with uncomplicated, mild to moderate hypertension for a period of 24 months. Blood pressure during sitting was 165 +/- 1/105 +/- 1 mmHg (mean +/- standard error of the mean) at the end of the placebo run-in period and 143 +/- 1/88 +/- 1 and 140 +/- 1/85 +/- 1 mmHg after 2 and 24 months, respectively; heart rate was clinically unmodified (from 77 +/- 1 to 75 +/- 1 beats/min). Total cholesterol, high-density cholesterol and serum triglycerides were unchanged, and uric acid increased significantly (from 292.0 +/- 6.5 to 377.7 +/- 56.5 mumols/liter). A mild reduction in serum potassium (-0.36 +/- 0.03 mmol/liter) was observed after 2 and 6 months of therapy; however, the degree of reduction appeared to be lower than that from reported studies with other thiazide diuretics. The incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mmol/liter) was highest in northern Italy (17%), intermediate in the central region (14%) and lowest in southern Italy (2%), although the absolute reduction in serum potassium was similar in all the geographic areas. Blood glucose tolerance was unchanged despite the changes in serum potassium. The tolerability was good on the whole, with a tendency toward an improvement in the well-being of patients, most of whom were already asymptomatic before starting the study.", 
    "49": "A multicenter study was performed to assess the efficacy and the acceptability of indapamide in hypertensive patients previously untreated, or treated and unsatisfactorily controlled with either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or beta-blocking therapy. Four centers participated in the study, which included patients whose supine diastolic blood pressure was between 95 and 115 mmHg with no treatment (group I, n = 40), those taking captopril (group II, n = 40) or those taking propranolol (group III, n = 40). After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, patients received indapamide either alone (group I) or in combination with the previous therapy (groups II and III) for 4 months. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and clinical and biochemical acceptability were measured before and after 2 and 4 months of treatment. At the same time points, quality of life was determined using standardized questionnaires completed by the patient (20 items) and the physician (10 items) and a visual analog scale completed by the patient. In all groups, administration of indapamide induced a clinically and statistically significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the supine position after 2 months. Indapamide alone controlled blood pressure in 82% of the patients previously untreated, and indapamide in combined therapy controlled blood pressure, respectively, in 67 and 85% of patients previously uncontrolled with ACE inhibitors or beta blockers. In all groups, questionnaires on quality of life showed a progressive and significant improvement in general well-being. After 4 months of treatment, the percentage of improvement in the physician questionnaire was 77.1% in group I, 60.6% in group II and 71.4% in group III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The effects of the calcium channel blocker of the arylalkylamine series verapamil have been investigated on high-density lipoprotein (HDL3) catabolism in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. It was found that verapamil markedly enhanced HDL3 binding, uptake and degradation in Hep G2 cells preloaded with nonlipoprotein cholesterol. This effect was dose-dependent, and a 1.5-2-fold increase of the three studied parameters was observed in cells pretreated 24 h with 100 microM verapamil. No significant effect of the drug was found in cells not preincubated with cholesterol. Verapamil induced an increase in the cellular cholesterol content in preloaded cells. Other calcium antagonists such as diltiazem, nifedipine, nitrendipine or amphiphilic drugs such as phenothiazines and propranolol also enhanced HDL3 uptake by Hep G2 cells. These effects of verapamil on HDL3 metabolism could be related to its amphiphilic characteristics, and to its calcium antagonist properties.", 
    "51": "The efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in reducing cardiovascular complications has been clearly demonstrated in the last 20 years. Antihypertensives are particularly useful in the reduction of cerebrovascular complications which decrease by 60% on average in clinical trials on the treatment of mild and severe hypertension. After the first clinical trials, the 1978 World Health Organization Experts Committee recommended the classic stepped-care (SC) approach with diuretics and beta blockers as first-step agents. Other antihypertensive drugs, such as reserpine, centrally acting agents and vasodilators could be used in the next steps if blood pressure control was not achieved. Both diuretics and beta blockers have been widely used and the SC regimen has contributed to the better control of arterial hypertension in the community. The SC regimen has given general practitioners easy guidelines with which to treat hypertensive patients. There are many reasons for modifying the classic SC approach. Prescription of antihypertensive drugs at high doses should be avoided and the use of new agents, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, is recommended. Demographic trends have brought about an increase in the aged population and, consequently, an increase in the proportion of elderly hypertensives. These patients present particular problems in long-term management, among which are a high frequency of other associated diseases and an important number of adverse effects caused by the classic antihypertensive drugs. Nevertheless, diuretics are still useful in the treatment of hypertension, either as a monotherapy regimen or in association with other drugs. New diuretics, such as indapamide, have a very interesting pharmacologic profile with considerably fewer metabolic side effects on plasma cholesterol and glucose levels.", 
    "52": "Paired bicycle ergometry [correction of veloergometric] testing was carried out in 94 patients with a history of myocardial infarction before and after single intakes of 40 mg of obsidan and 200 mg of labetalol. The effect of these agents on the increase of tolerance to physical load was evaluated. It was found that obsidan and labetalol increased the tolerance of these patients to physical loads. The positive effect was realized due to negative chronotropic effect of obsidan and reduction of the systemic arterial pressure under the effect of labetalol.",

Respiratory modulation of cardiac parasympathetic activity and the relationship between respiratory sinus arrhythmia and parasympathetic control has been studied in twenty-nine conscious, healthy young adult subjects. 2. Changes in heart period in propranolol-treated subjects were taken as the measure of changes in cardiac parasympathetic activity; respiratory sinus arrhythmia was quantified as the difference between maximum and minimum heart periods in a given respiratory cycle; cardiac parasympathetic control was defined as the change in heart period after administration of a full dose of atropine. 3. During normal quiet breathing the inspiratory level of cardiac parasympathetic activity was not reduced to zero. The expiratory level was influenced by excitatory inputs whose activation was related to respiratory cycle length. 4. Slow breathing was associated with augmented sinus arrhythmia, but in different individuals the influence on minimum and maximum heart periods varied so that mean heart period was increased in some subjects but decreased in others. This occurred both in control conditions and after administration of a full dose of propranolol. 5. During normal breathing the correlation across subjects between respiratory sinus arrhythmia and parasympathetic control, although significant, was not close (r = 0.61). The relationship was not affected by beta-adrenergic blockade (r = 0.63). The strength of the correlation improved when multiple regression of respiratory sinus arrhythmia was performed on three variables: parasympathetic control, respiratory cycle length and tidal volume (R = 0.93). 6. It is concluded that in conscious human subjects the respiratory modulation of cardiac parasympathetic activity is different from that observed in the anaesthetized dog, and that variations in the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia do not necessarily reflect proportional changes in cardiac parasympathetic control.", 
    "56": "The antiarrhythmic activity of quinasopirine was studied in the experiments on rats with the use of models of calcium chloride- and aconitine-induced arrhythmias, disorders of cardiac rhythm in myocardial infarction produced by isadrine and pituitrin and also in the experiments on cats in arrhythmias caused by electric stimulation of the myocardium, postinfarction and reperfusion arrhythmias. Quinasopirine exhibits the antiarrhythmic effect being superior to that of anapriline and novocainamide in arrhythmias induced by calcium chloride and aconitine. In other types of the cardiac rhythm disorder its activity is comparable with that of ethmosine, obsidane and cordarone. Quinasopirine reduces automatism and contractile function of the myocardium.", 
    "57": "In isolated electrically driven left and in spontaneously beating right guinea-pig atria, the calcium ionophore ionomycin produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic and chronotropic effect with a threshold near 10(-7) mol/l and a pD2 of 6.31 +/- 0.09 and 5.94 +/- 0.07, respectively. At low [Ca2+]o (0.5 mmol/l), the positive inotropic effect of ionomycin (3 X 10(-6) mol/l) was strongly attenuated by ryanodine and nifedipine, and slightly attenuated by pindolol and mepyramine; atropine had no effect. The positive chronotropic effect of ionomycin was slightly reduced by cimetidine or pindolol, whereas atropine, nifedipine, and ryanodine showed no inhibitory activity. The oxygen consumption of resting left atria was significantly enhanced by addition of ionomycin. It is concluded that the action of ionomycin involves at least the following mechanisms: I) release of Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum, II) influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space, and, having little significance, III) release of catecholamines and histamine from sympathetic nerve endings and tissue mast cells. However, additional mechanisms of action of ionomycin cannot be excluded.", 
    "58": "In contrast to patients with organic heart disease, there are only few data available on the incidence and type of inducible arrhythmias during programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) but without evidence of underlying heart disease. Additionally, no consensus has been achieved in these patients on the most appropriate stimulation protocol required to reproduce the clinical arrhythmia. In a prospective study we analyzed in 40 patients without idiopathic VT, incidence and type of inducible VT, as well as the mode of initiation during a right ventricular PES protocol with 1-2 (part I) and three extrastimuli (part II). Twelve patients had spontaneous sustained monomorphic VT (group A), 28 patients were studied with spontaneous non-sustained VT (group B). During PES, a non-sustained polymorphic VT was induced in 3/12 patients (group A, 25%) and in 10/28 patients (group B, 36%); a non-sustained monomorphic VT was induced in 5/12 patients (group A, 41%) and in 4/28 patients (group B, 14%). In all 7/12 patients (59%) of group A with inducible sustained monomorphic VT, the arrhythmia was initiated with 1-2 extrastimuli. In group B, only 2/28 patients (7%) were induced to a sustained monomorphic VT. When the clinical arrhythmia was exercise-related, 5/6 patients (83%) in group A and 7/13 patients (54%) in group B were induced to a VT, while 2/6 patients (33%) in group A and 1/13 (8%) patients in group B were induced to a sustained monomorphic VT. Isoprenaline was not effective to increase the incidence of sustained monomorphic VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The amounts of endotoxin in commercial blood products were measured by the turbidimetric kinetic Limulus test with an ordinary reagent (LAL-HS) and a new endotoxin-specific reagent (LAL-ES). LAL-ES contains a sufficient amount of a water-soluble (1----3)-beta-D-glucan derivative as a blocker of the (1----3)-beta-D-glucan-mediated coagulation pathway in the reaction of the Limulus amebocyte lysate. The amounts of endotoxin in albumin and globulin products measured with LAL-ES agreed with pyrogenic activities in rabbits, but those measured with LAL-HS did not. Added endotoxin in the blood products was well recovered with LAL-ES, but that in some products was excessively recovered with LAL-HS. The amounts of endotoxin in diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus combined vaccines measured with LAL-HS and LAL-ES agreed with the pyrogenic activities in rabbits. The results suggested the existence of a false-positive substance like beta-glucan in the blood products but not in the vaccine. LAL-ES is more suitable for the detection of endotoxin in blood products than LAL-HS.", 
    "60": "Despite a large number of studies demonstrating the effectiveness of propranolol in relieving essential tremor (ET) the long-term therapeutic outcome of these patients remains poorly defined. The results of a one-year follow-up study in 18 patients with mild to severe ET performed by using clinical and computer-based methods of assessment indicate that the initial therapeutic benefit of propranolol is apparently retained. However, following 3-6 months of sustained treatment a proportion of patients required an increase in daily dosage of propranolol in order to maintain adequate symptomatic control of tremor, indicating a relative decrease in tremorolytic efficacy of the drug possibly due to long-term tolerance.",

    "62": "The study was performed in isolated, arterially perfused interventricular septa from rabbit. Six septa were treated with d.l-sotalol 10(-4) mol.litre-1, six with d-sotalol 10(-4) mol.litre-1, six with atenolol 10(-5) mol.litre-1, and there were seven untreated controls. At these concentrations d.l and d-sotalol are equipotent in their class III effect, though d-sotalol has only 7% of the beta blocking activity of the racemic form, and atenolol is equipotent in its beta blocking activity to d.l-sotalol. [K+]o and electrophysiological variables were compared before and during a 30 min period of global zero flow ischaemia.", 
    "63": "Prior to ischaemia [K+]o, measured using potassium sensitive valinomycin electrodes, was similar in all the groups. [K+]o rose during ischaemia in all the groups, and at 30 min was 13.0 (SEM 0.7) mmol.litre-1 in the control group which was not different from 12.7(0.5) mmol.litre-1 in the atenolol group. In the d.l and d-sotalol groups the increases were markedly attenuated, reaching 9.2(1.0) and 8.8(0.7) mmol.litre-1 respectively. During ischaemia the class III effect of d.l and d-sotalol was lost within 6 min though the fall in maximum upstroke velocity of the action potentials (dV/dtmax) and the extent of resting membrane potential (Em) depolarisation were less in comparison to the control and atenolol groups.", 
    "64": "The results indicate an attenuation by sotalol of the ischaemic rise in [K+]o, with preservation of dV/dtmax and Em, despite the loss of an effect on action potential duration. This potentially antiarrhythmic effect of sotalol in ischaemic myocardium is attributable to a direct membrane effect rather than beta adrenoceptor antagonism.", 
    "65": "The pineal gland is a complex neuroendocrine organ which is under photoneuroendocrine control. Previous studies in animals and humans have suggested reciprocal variations in pineal melatonin biosynthesis and adrenal glucocorticoid output; it remains unclear, however, whether a causal relationship exists between these two systems. To address this question, we examined the overnight secretory activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in conjunction with acute pharmacological suppression of pineal melatonin biosynthesis in 11 healthy volunteers. Results of the current study are consistent with the hypothesis that melatonin does not function as a tonic inhibitor of the HPA axis on an acute basis.", 
    "66": "Hypotensive activity of 2-(2-(4-(3-methylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl) quinoline (compound 71/73; centhaquin) was studied in cat and rat. The compound lowered the blood pressure and reduced the heart rate of anaesthetized and unanaesthetized (decerebrate) cat in a dose-dependent manner (0.01-1.0 mg/kg i.v. or 1.0-2.5 mg/kg intraduodenally). The hypotensive effect was insignificant in spinal transected cat but more marked in deafferented and vagotomized animals. Localization of centhaquin to brain by intravertebral arterial injection (5-10 micrograms) or by topical application to the exposed ventral surface of medulla or floor of the fourth ventricle caused hypotension and bradycardia as well as reduced the excitability of the vasomotor loci. It was also effective in rats after single as well as multiple dosing. The compound seems to act centrally to reduce the blood pressure.", 
    "67": "Variations in left ventricular (LV) wall tension during changes in LV end-diastolic volume significantly affect myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2). In the present study we examined if the reduction in MVO2 per beat accompanying a decline in LV end-diastolic volume at constant LV systolic pressure (LVSP) is dependent on the level of myocardial inotropy. In six anaesthetized open-chest pigs, the blood volume was expanded by i.v. infusion of a Ringer solution. At constant heart rate (by atrial pacing) and LVSP (by adjustments of a proximal aortic snare), LV end-diastolic volume was reduced in steps by withdrawals of blood. This procedure was performed at high inotropy (during a continuous intracoronary infusion of isoproterenol, 0.40 +/- 0.08 micrograms min-1), and at low inotropy (after i.v. injection of 3.4 +/- 0.2 mg propranolol). LVSP was about 25 mmHg higher at high than at low inotropy. The fall in LV tension was therefore greater during blood volume reductions at high than at low inotropy because the fall in LV end-diastolic volume was almost identical and was initiated from the same level at both high and low inotropy. Nevertheless, the slope of the MVO2/LV end-diastolic volume relationship was significantly (P less than 0.05) less steep at high (1.26 +/- 0.30 mumol 100 g-1 mm-1) than at low inotropy (2.06 +/- 0.48 mumol 100 g-1 mm-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "1. The influence of a single oral dose of nicardipine 30 mg on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol 80 mg was investigated in twelve healthy volunteers. 2. Co-administration of nicardipine significantly increased the AUC and the mean Cmax of propranolol. 3. Blood pressure and heart rate tended to decrease more when propranolol and nicardipine were administered together than when propranolol was given alone, but differences are of doubtful significance. 4. The results indicate that nicardipine alters the pharmacokinetics of propranolol by impaired hepatic 'first-pass' clearance, but pharmacodynamics were little affected.", 
    "69": "Dilevalol (100 mg) or atenolol (50 mg) was given orally in 13 subjects with essential hypertension. Two trials were done by a single-blind, crossover design with an interval of 6 days. Blood samples for drug concentrations were taken for a period of 24 hours after dosage. A retained percentage of indocyanine green dye at 15 minute (ICG R15) reflecting hepatic function and a creatinine clearance (CLCR) reflecting renal function were determined in each subject during observation period. A significant correlation was observed between the ICG R15 and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of dilevalol, while there was no significant correlation between the CLCR and any pharmacokinetic parameter of the agent. In contrast to dilevalol, significant correlations were observed between the CLCR and AUC or elimination half-life of atenolol. However, there was no significant correlation between the ICG R15 and any pharmacokinetic parameter of atenolol. These data indicate that the disposition of dilevalol is influenced by hepatic rather than by renal function while that of atenolol is altered by renal function.", 
    "70": "Akathesia is a common side effect of neuroleptic medication and has been reported to occur in patients with Tourette's Syndrome (TS). In TS, the differentiation between untreated hyperactivity and akathesia can be difficult. A case of neuroleptic treated TS with hyperactivity versus akathesia is presented in which propranolol was successfully used to treat the akathesia. The akathesia reappeared when the propranolol was withdrawn. This case illustrates an alternative to neuroleptic dose reduction in the management of akathesia in TS.", 
    "71": "Diltiazem and verapamil inhibit oxidative drug metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. We compared their effects on the stereoselective pharmacokinetics and protein binding of propranolol in 12 subjects. After 6 days of coadministration with racemic propranolol, diltiazem caused decreases of 27% and 24% in d-propranolol and 1-propranolol oral clearances, respectively (p less than 0.05 versus control). With verapamil, d-propranolol oral clearance decreased 32% (p less than 0.05), and 1-propranolol oral clearance decreased 26% (p less than 0.05). The unbound fraction of d-propranolol was higher than that of 1-propranolol (p less than 0.05), but the protein binding was not altered by diltiazem or verapamil. Both drugs therefore decreased the unbound oral clearance of each propranolol enantiomer (p less than 0.05). Verapamil caused a stereoselective effect and increased the d/l ratio of propranolol serum concentrations (p less than 0.05) and decreased the d/l ratio of oral clearance (p less than 0.05).", 
    "72": "This study was undertaken to establish if beta-blocking drugs given orally before surgery could reduce the pressor responses to laryngeal instrumentation and tracheal intubation in neurosurgical patients. Forty-two neurosurgical patients undergoing craniotomy were randomized into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 received atenolol (100 mg) and propranolol (80 mg) respectively. Group 3 were controls and given no beta-blockers. A standard anaesthetic technique was used and blood pressure and heart rate were measured continuously from induction of anaesthesia until five minutes after tracheal intubation. There were increases in both heart rate and systolic blood pressure in all three groups but the rises in the treated groups were significantly less than in the control group (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the haemodynamic responses between the propranolol and atenolol treated patients.", 
    "73": "As age and sex affect the function of the lower urinary tract, we studied the characteristics of adrenergic and cholinergic receptors in various parts of lower urinary tract smooth muscle of young (6 months) and old (4 1/2-5 years) male and female rabbits. Saturation experiments performed with [3H]prazosin, [3H]yohimbine, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate in rabbit bladder base, bladder dome and urethra indicate the presence of regional, sex- and age-related differences in the density of alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor density is considerably higher in the female than in the male urethra of both age groups, whereas the higher density of beta adrenergic receptors in the female than in the male bladder base is observed only in the younger animals. The density of muscarinic receptors is higher in bladder dome than in bladder base or urethra in young rabbits of both sexes. In the old animals, the density of muscarinic receptors in bladder base increases to the level observed in bladder dome. Inhibition experiments with selective adrenergic agonists and antagonists indicate that the pharmacological profiles of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the urethra and beta adrenergic receptors in the bladder dome and bladder base are similar in both sexes and at both ages. Beta-2 adrenergic receptors are shown to be predominant in bladder base and bladder dome of rabbits. Parallel studies in rabbit urethra, adult rat cortex and neonatal rat lung show that the urethral alpha-2 adrenergic receptors are of the alpha-2A subtype.", 
    "74": "The mechanism of bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction was studied in anesthetized guinea pigs after both i.v. administration and direct airway instillation. We monitored airway opening pressure as an index of airway caliber, and the provocative dose of bradykinin required to produce 100% increase in airway opening pressure (PD100) was determined. Animals were pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) to inhibit adrenergic bronchodilatation. After i.v. administration, the bronchoconstrictor dose-response curve to bradykinin (PD100 = 0.93 nmol/kg) was shifted significantly to the right by atropine (PD100 = 2.34 nmol/kg, P less than .05) and indomethacin (PD100 = 61.7 nmol/kg, P less than .05). Depletion of tachykinins by capsaicin pretreatment had no significant effect on the response to i.v. bradykinin. After tracheal instillation, the bronchoconstrictor dose-response curve to bradykinin (PD100 = 24.5 nmol) was shifted to the right by atropine (PD100 greater than 150 nmol, P less than .05) and capsaicin pretreatment (PD100 greater than 150 nmol, P less than .05). After atropine the response to instilled bradykinin was almost abolished in capsaicin-pretreated animals. Indomethacin had no effect on the bronchoconstrictor response to instilled bradykinin. We conclude that i.v. bradykinin causes bronchoconstriction predominantly by the release of cyclooxygenase products but that a cholinergic reflex is also involved, whereas sensory neuropeptides are not important. By contrast the bronchoconstrictor response to instilled bradykinin is mediated by neural mechanisms involving both cholinergic nerves and sensory neuropeptides but not by cyclooxygenase products.", 
    "75": "Isolated human, Japanese monkey and dog epicardial coronary arteries and dog renal and mesenteric arteries treated with phentolamine responded to isoproterenol with a concentration-related relaxation. The KB values of metoprolol, a beta-1 antagonist, in the coronary arteries from different mammals did not differ, but were appreciably smaller than those in the dog renal and mesenteric arteries. Treatment with butoxamine, a beta-2 antagonist, inhibited the relaxation of dog mesenteric arteries to a greater extent than that of monkey and dog coronary arteries. Terbutaline, a beta-2 agonist, produced a greater relaxation in monkey mesenteric and dog renal and mesenteric arteries than in human, monkey and dog coronary arteries. Norepinephrine relaxed the monkey and dog coronary arteries dose-dependently via mainly beta-1 adrenoceptors, but elicited a contraction or a minute relaxation in dog mesenteric arteries even when treated with high concentrations of phentolamine. Contractile responses to electrical stimulation of adrenergic nerves in monkey coronary arteries were potentiated by treatment with metoprolol and propranolol, whereas the contractions in dog mesenteric arteries were unaffected. It is concluded that the amine-induced relaxation of human and monkey epicardial coronary arteries is mediated mainly by beta-1 adrenoceptor subtype, as is the response of dog coronary arteries. Involvement of beta-1 subtype in coronary artery relaxations would be a mechanism underlying potentiation by beta antagonists of the contraction caused by norepinephrine released from adrenergic nerves in primates.", 
    "76": "Experiments were designed to characterize the nature of the epinephrine-induced potentiation of responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the Hooded Wistar rat. The responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation were determined in the isolated perfused mesenteric vascular bed preparation before and after infusion of epinephrine (at 0.27 or 2.7 microM); at the conclusion of the experiment the content of epinephrine in the mesenteric artery was determined. The intraluminal infusion of epinephrine at both high and low concentrations potentiated the responses of the preparation to sympathetic nerve stimulation. Mesenteric artery concentrations of this catecholamine were unchanged at the lower concentration (0.27 microM), but were increased after perfusion of epinephrine at the higher concentration (2.7 microM). The beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.5 microM) did not prevent the epinephrine-associated potentiation of responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, nor did it influence the pressor effects of exogenous norepinephrine. The results suggest that beta adrenoceptors do not play a role in the epinephrine-induced potentiation of responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the rat mesenteric vascular bed preparation. This potentiation may, however, be related to a desensitization of presynaptic inhibitory alpha adrenoceptors.", 
    "77": "We studied the effects of stimulation of the vagal and sympathetic cardiac nerves on left ventricular contraction and relaxation in 16 anesthetized dogs. In each experiment, we paced the ventricles at a fixed rate of 120 beats/min, and we kept the systemic arterial pressure constant. We used the maximum rates of left ventricular pressure rise (dP/dtmax) and fall (dP/dtmin) as our indexes of ventricular contraction and relaxation. Sympathetic nerve stimulation at a frequency of 6 Hz increased dP/dtmax by 802 mmHg/s and raised dP/dtmin by 847 mmHg/s above the control level. The effect of vagal nerve stimulation was directly dependent on the level of sympathetic stimulation. In the absence of sympathetic stimulation, vagal nerve stimulation at a frequency of 5 Hz decreased dP/dtmax by 187 mmHg/s and reduced dP/dtmin by 199 mmHg/s below the control level. When the sympathetic stimulation was 6 Hz, vagal nerve stimulation at 5 Hz decreased dP/dtmax by 513 mmHg/s and reduced dP/dtmin by 709 mmHg/s. Furthermore, propranolol, in doses of 1.5 mg/kg, abolished any significant vagal effect on ventricular contraction or relaxation. We conclude that combined sympathetic-vagal stimulation results in a substantial antagonistic interaction such that vagal stimulation significantly attenuates the sympathetic enhancement of left ventricular function.", 
    "78": "Lens refractive function was monitored during long-term bovine lens culture experiments in which low concentrations of potentially damaging agents were added to the culture media. The agents tested were the drugs DL-propranolol and prednisone, and hydrogen peroxide. A computer-driven scanning laser system was used to monitor lens focal length during culture. The system consists of a scanning helium-neon laser beam, a television video camera, and a video frame digitizer. The system first locates the optical center of the lens, defined as the position of little or no refractive deviation of the beam. The laser scans the lens in small steps (0.05 mm), while the digitizer measures focal length for each beam position. A graphic profile of lens focal variation is plotted. A concentration of 0.1 mM hydrogen peroxide produces no significant change in lens focus after 315 hr of incubation. When the concentration is increased 10-fold (1.0 mM), lens focal ability is radically disturbed after 60 hr of incubation. Lenses incubated with prednisone (0.03 mM) for up to 525 hr show no difference in focal characteristics in comparison to control lenses. Propranolol in a concentration of 0.1 mM disrupts lens focal ability after 250 hr of incubation, whereas a higher concentration (1.0 mM) produces a similar effect after only 150 hr. These results indicate that lens refractive function is a sensitive measure of lens function during culture.", 
    "79": "The antiperoxidative activities of nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem were compared with that of propranolol by using an in vitro model of sarcolemmal membrane lipid peroxidation. Highly purified sarcolemmal membranes, isolated from canine ventricular myocytes, were peroxidized by a superoxide anion-producing and iron-catalyzed free radical-generating system (dihydroxy-fumarate plus FeCl3 and ADP). Lipid peroxidation after 20 minutes of incubation was monitored by malondialdehyde formation. Similar to propranolol, all three calcium blockers exhibited concentration-dependent (10-400 microM) inhibitory effects against sarcolemmal lipid peroxidation. The order of potency of these agents was nifedipine greater than propranolol greater than verapamil greater than diltiazem. Nifedipine, the most effective calcium blocker, was greater than twofold more potent than propranolol and achieved a significant effect at 10 microM. This study suggests that calcium blockers may provide antiperoxidative protection to cardiac membranes.", 
    "80": "We gave atropine intravenously to autonomically decentralized, open-chest, anesthetized dogs and stimulated the discrete intracardiac sympathetic nerve fibers to the sinoatrial (SA) (SAS stimulation) or atrioventricular (AV (AVS stimulation) nodal region. A brief burst of neural stimuli was delivered during each cardiac cycle. SAS stimulation consistently decreased the atrial cycle length but had variable effects on the AV interval. The positive chronotropic response to SAS stimulation increased when the level of stimulation (i.e., stimulus pulse duration, pulse amplitude, and number of pulses per burst) was increased. When the heart rate was held constant by atrial pacing, SAS stimulation did not change the AV interval. AVS stimulation decreased the AV conduction time but did not change the atrial cycle length. The AV conduction response increased when the level of AVS stimulation was increased. A high level of AVS stimulation induced an AV junctional rhythm in seven of eight experiments. When the atrial pacing interval was decreased, the basal AV interval increased, and the decrease in AV interval induced by AVS stimulation was exaggerated. The chronotropic response to SAS stimulation and the dromotropic response to AVS stimulation were abolished by propranolol given systemically and by lidocaine given topically. From these results, we conclude that in anesthetized dogs treated with atropine, activation of the discrete intracardiac sympathetic nerves to the SA and AV nodal regions controls the sinus rate and AV conduction time independently and activation of the discrete sympathetic nerves may shift the dominant pacemaker site to a subsidiary site.", 
    "81": "Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is of clinical importance but has not been readily modeled in conscious animals. Eleven pigs had myocardial infarction induced by pulling snares previously placed around the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Six days after occlusion, bipolar pacing catheters were inserted in the right ventricular apex for induction of VT. Testing was repeated in conscious pigs on 6 out of 8 to 19 days after infarction. Monomorphic VT was induced in each animal during each session, using three to four extrastimuli. VT was terminated by burst pacing in 74% of trials; average VT rate was 362 +/- 26 beats/min. VT was prevented in four of eight animals by procainamide and in five of eight animals by magnesium, but was not prevented by lidocaine or metoprolol. The model may be useful in the study of potentially malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias, important prodromes for sudden death.", 
    "82": "There is considerable evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II) attenuates the baroreflex control of heart rate (HR), but the mechanism and site of this action have not been precisely defined. In the present study the effects of systemically and centrally administered Ang II on the baroreflex control of HR were investigated in conscious, chronically prepared rabbits. Baroreflex curves (HR vs. mean arterial pressure) were generated with iv infusions of phenylephrine or nitroprusside. Background infusion of Ang II at 10 ng/kg.min increased mean arterial pressure from 77.3 +/- 3.0 to 94.3 +/- 4.1 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) without changing HR [212.1 +/- 7.2 to 218.0 +/- 9.8 beats/min (bpm)] and shifted (reset) the baroreflex curve with phenylephrine to a higher pressure level (P less than 0.001) without changing its slope (-1.40 +/- 0.40 to -1.65 +/- 0.46 bpm/mm Hg; P = 0.4). Background infusion of an equipressor dose of phenylephrine did not shift the baroreflex curve or change its slope. Ang II also shifted the baroreflex curve with nitroprusside to a higher pressure level (P less than 0.01), but again the slope was not significantly changed (-2.30 +/- 1.25 to -1.51 +/- 0.52 bpm/mm Hg; P = 0.2). Background intraventricular infusion of Ang II at 1 ng/kg.min had the same effects as iv infusion of Ang II at 10 ng/kg.min; the curve was shifted to a higher pressure level (P less than 0.001), but the slope was not changed (-0.76 +/- 0.47 to -1.143 +/- 0.48 bpm/mm Hg). Intravenous infusion of Ang II at 1 ng/kg.min had no effect on the baroreflex. The resetting of the baroreflex with phenylephrine by iv Ang II (10 ng/kg.min) was not blocked by propranolol: atropine markedly reduced the baroreflex response to phenylephrine in both the absence and presence of Ang II. These results indicate that in conscious rabbits, Ang II resets the baroreflex control of HR, but does not change its sensitivity. This effect apparently results from an action of Ang II on the brain that is mediated by withdrawal of vagal tone to the heart. The resetting of the baroreflex by Ang II can explain the ability of the peptide to increase arterial pressure without decreasing HR.", 
    "83": "Dopexamine hydrochloride is a new analog of dopamine that lowers systemic vascular resistance and has positive inotropic and chronotropic properties, but lacks the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist activity of dopamine. The effects of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) are not known. We investigated this using an isolated, blood-perfused, and ventilated rat lung model. To study HPV, the ventilating gas was changed from an FIO2 of 0.21 to 0.03 and dopexamine hydrochloride was added. At blood concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 ng/ml, dopexamine caused a significant decrease in HPV of 22 +/- 3%, 31 +/- 4%, and 58 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM, p less than .05), respectively. This effect was blocked completely by pretreatment of the preparation with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg, p less than .05). Dopexamine also induced significant (p less than .05) vasodilation of the pulmonary circulation preconstricted under normoxic conditions with prostaglandin F2 alpha, suggesting that the effects of the drug were not specific to hypoxia. We conclude that dopexamine inhibits HPV and vasodilates the pulmonary circulation by stimulation of beta 2 adrenoceptors.", 
    "84": "We evaluated the effects of acute blood loss on the respiratory mechanics of guinea pigs. We measured respiratory system elastance (Ers) and resistance (Rrsmax) using the end-inflation occlusion method. Rrsmax was partitioned into its homogeneous component (Rrsmin) and that due to the unevenness within the respiratory system (Rrsu). Respiratory mechanics were studied both before and immediately after bleeding in eight animals. Another eight guinea pigs had received propranolol previously and were also submitted to hemorrhage. Propranolol-treated animals showed higher control values of Rrsmax (p less than .02) and Rrsmin (p less than .0001). Animals not treated with propranolol exhibited a decrease (p less than 0.001) in Rrsmax after hemorrhagic hypovolemia (from 0.375 +/- 0.051 to 0.323 +/- 0.042 cm H2O/ml.sec), due to a decrease (p less than 0.005) in Rrsmin (from 0.140 +/- 0.031 to 0.094 +/- 0.032 cm H2O/ml.sec), whereas Ers and Rrsu did not change. Propranolol-treated animals showed an increase (p less than .001) in Rrsmax (from 0.512 +/- 0.133 to 0.664 +/- 0.144 cm H2O/ml.sec), Rrsu (p less than 0.01) from 0.252 +/- 0.09 to 0.345 +/- 0.139 cm H2O/ml.sec, and Ers (p less than 0.001) (from 4.565 +/- 0.933 to 5.402 +/- 1.24 cm H2O/ml) after bleeding. The results indicate that the immediate effects of acute bleeding on respiratory mechanics are significantly influenced by catecholamines."
