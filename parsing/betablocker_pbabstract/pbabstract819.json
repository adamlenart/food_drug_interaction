    "0": "Cardiac arrhythmias produced by electrical stimulation of the ventrolateral cardiac sympathetic nerve in dogs were not blocked by the combined administration of propranolol and practolol in amounts that completely blocked cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. Blockade of cardiac alpha-adrenergic receptors, as well as cardiac cholinergic receptors, also had no influence on the arrhythmias. These results suggest that the adrenergic neuroeffector junction is fundamentally different from any hitherto described, differing perhaps in the neurotransmitter involved or in the nature of the receptor.", 
    "1": "Selective autonomic blockade with intravenous propranolol, practolol, atropine, and combined atropine-propranolol was utilized to elucidate the role of the autonomic nervous system in the hemodynamic responses in young adult male volunteers to handgrip sustained at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction for 3 min. The initial 30 s of the tachycardia response was found to be mediated by withdrawal of vagal dominance, as evidenced by blockade of this response by prior atropinization. The mid and late portion of the heart rate response curve was demonstrated to be sympathetic in origin, since it was unaffected by atropine, but was suppressed by combined atropine-propranolol blockade. Sympathetic stimulation appears to be a secondary mechanism for increasing the heart rate, however, as it becomes operative only after the first mechanism of vagal withdrawal has been utilized. This was confirmed by the finding that beta adrenergic receptor blockade alone had little effect on the heart rate response curve. The pressor response to handgrip was accompanied by increased cardiac output and no change in calculated systemic vascular resistance. After propranolol, handgrip resulted in increased peripheral resistance and an equivalent rise in arterial pressure, but no increase in cardiac output. It was concluded that the increase in resistance was the result of sympathetically induced vasoconstriction. This response was shown to be independent of peripheral beta adrenergic receptor blockade by the use of practolol, a cardio-selective beta adrenergic receptor-blocking drug which caused identical hemodynamic responses to those observed after propranolol. Left ventricular ejection time (corrected for heart rate) was prolonged by handgrip. The increased afterload imposed on the left ventricle by sustained handgrip may explain the prolongation of ejection time index. Preejection period was prolonged by SHG after propranolol and shortened after atropine. In addition to confirming the previously defined role of the parasympathetic nervous system, this study delineates the role of the sympathetic nervous system in the heart rate and pressor responses to sustained handgrip.", 
    "2": "Turkey erythrocyte ghosts (empty membranes) possess a class of receptors that can bind both L-[(3)H]isoproterenol and DL-[(3)H]propranolol. The binding of [(3)H]isoproterenol to these receptors occurs with a dissociation constant of 0.15 muM and can be fully inhibited by 1 muM propranolol. The binding of [(3)H]propranolol occurs with a dissociation constant of 2.5 nM and can be fully inhibited by 0.2 mM DL-isoproterenol. Ligand binding is sensitive to sonication, boiling, and 8 M urea. The cells possess 500 to 1000 beta-adrenergic receptors per cell. Binding of propranolol to the beta-receptor was found to be stereospecific for the L stereoisomer. If one assumed a 1:1 relationship between beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase, the turnover number of this adenylate cyclase would be close to 100 min(-1).", 
    "3": "The cardiovascular effects of ergometrine have been examined using animal models in vivo and in vitro. In rats in vivo the pressor effects of a standard dose of ergometrine were found to be dependent upon the anaesthetic used for the procedure. The pressor action of ergometrine was greater when urethane, an anaesthetic which produces both sympathetic and parasympathetic acitivity, was used. The in-vitro experiments, using isolated rabbit aorta and portal vein, failed to explain the phenomenon; they suggested that ergometrine has a direct action on the alpha-adrenoceptor in rabbits. No evidence was found to suggest that ergometrine inhibits noradrenaline uptake or its release from the nerve terminals.", 
    "4": "1 In conscious unrestrained cats noradrenaline, alpha-methylnoradrenaline and clonidine, infused into the lateral cerebral ventricles (i.c.v.) caused dose-related falls in blood pressure and heart rate; both effects were abolished after i.c.v. phentolamine.2 In 12 out of 20 cats, i.c.v. isoprenaline and salbutamol when given caused dose-related pressor responses and tachycardias. These effects were abolished after i.c.v. beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs but were unaffected by alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents.3 In 5 out of 20 cats, i.c.v. isoprenaline regularly produced dose-related falls in blood pressure with associated tachycardias; both effects were abolished after i.c.v. beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents.4 Intracerebroventricular dopamine produced cardiovascular responses which were qualitatively similar to those produced by i.c.v. isoprenaline.5 Intracerebroventricular adrenaline produced complex responses in untreated animals but typical alpha-effects were obtained after prior i.c.v. treatment with a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent and typical beta-effects after i.c.v. pretreatment with an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent.6 The cardiovascular changes produced by i.c.v. beta-adrenoceptor agonists were abolished after systemic administration of hexamethonium or bethanidine.7 The results are discussed in the light of the mode of action of beta-adrenoceptor stimulants and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "5": "1 Intravenous injections of urotensin I regularly caused a long-lasting, dose-related, lowering of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate in conscious rats, or a reduction in perfusion pressure in the isolated hind limb of the rat.2 After subcutaneous administration, the hypotensive effect of urotensin I was greater in extent and in duration (> 24 hours).3 Anaesthesia with ether, chloralose, pentobarbitone and thiobarbitone caused a decrease in blood pressure and only slightly diminished the hypotensive effect of urotensin.4 Mecamylamine, hexamethonium, atropine, phenoxybenzamine, propranolol and diphenhydramine did not alter the effect of urotensin in conscious rats or in the isolated hind limb, although the effects of the respective agonists, i.e. nicotine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, isoprenaline and histamine were inhibited.5 In conscious rats, pressor effects of adrenaline, noradrenaline, nicotine and angiotensin II, and depressor effects of acetylcholine and bradykinin, were decreased or inhibited, whereas the hypotensive effect of phenoxybenzamine was potentiated by previous administration of urotensin I. Carotid occlusion reflex was partially inhibited by lower doses of urotensin and abolished by higher doses in rats lightly anaesthetized with chloralose. Urotensin elicited postural hypotension in rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone.6 The increase in heart rate produced by urotensin was not affected by phenoxybenzamine, but was abolished by propranolol or ganglion blocking agents (mecamylamine or hexamethonium).7 It is concluded that urotensin elicits hypotension in the rat by a direct dilatory action on the resistance vessels causing a simultaneous reflex tachycardia."
