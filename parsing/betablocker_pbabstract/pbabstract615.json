The exercise tests were subdivided in 4 phases: 1. introduction of a Swan-Ganz pulmonary wedge catheter; 2. resting phase until constant hemodynamic basal values were reached; duration 5 to 51, mean 18 +/- 8 min; 3. exercise phase; bicycle ergometer exercise in supine position; increase in work load by steps of 25 Watts to the maximum which was defined by onset of angina pectoris, dyspnea or exhaustion; total duration 6 to 41, mean 18 +/- 6 min; 4. resting phase after exercise, duration 1 to 30, mean 5 +/- 3 min. Ventricular arrhythmias were classified in a modified Lown classification: 1. no ventricular ectopic beats (VEB); 2. single VEB, less than 0.5/min; 3. single VEB, more than 0.5/min; 4. ventricular pairs; 5. ventricular salvos or tachycardias (3 or more QRS complexes). In the total series of 200 exercise tests in patients with HOCM, the highest incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was found during insertion of the pulmonary wedge catheter, i.e., in 75% of the cases. In nearly 20% of the cases, ventricular pairs or tachycardias were observed. The longest tachycardia consisted of 17 QRS complexes. All tachycardias terminated spontaneously. During the following resting phase, ventricular arrhythmias were documented in 52% of the cases, with ventricular pairs, however, in only 11 (5.5%) and ventricular tachycardias in only 5 (2.5%) tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Moderate doses of amphetamine and methylphenidate profoundly depress play fighting in juvenile rats. To test the idea that this behavioral effect was dependent on the release of catecholamines (CAs) we administered haloperidol (0.05-0.8 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (0.5-5 mg/kg), phenoxybenzamine (0.5-20 mg/kg) or propranolol (0.5-20 mg/kg) alone or in combination with 0.5 or 1 mg/kg d-amphetamine sulfate. None of these CA antagonists reversed the suppression of play fighting (indexed by pinning) caused by amphetamine, but at higher doses haloperidol, chlorpromazine and phenoxybenzamine depressed both pinning and rearing. The presynaptic NE agonist clonidine (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) also failed to block the effects of amphetamine on play; instead it too depressed both pinning and rearing. Finally the CA synthesis inhibitor, alpha-methyltyrosine (total dose: 100 mg/kg) did not attenuate the suppression of play by amphetamine. Ephedrine (10-80 mg/kg) mimicked the effects of amphetamine on pinning, but apomorphine did not. At doses from 0.125-0.5 mg/kg apomorphine stimulated pinning while 1 mg/kg had no effect. The present findings confirm earlier reports that amphetamine suppresses play fighting but the mechanism of action remains obscure.", 
    "2": "Oral or intravenous administration of allethrin, a synthetic derivative of the pirethrin-based insecticides, produces neurotoxic symptoms consisting of mild salivation, hyperexcitability, tremors and convulsions which result in death. Intracerebroventricular injection of allethrin to mouse at about one-nineth the dose of intravenous administration, produced qualitatively identical but less prominent symptoms, indicating that at least some of the symptoms may be originated in the central nervous system. To investigate the mechanism of action of the compound, we studied the ability of agents which alter neurotransmission to prevent or potentiate the effect of convulsive doses of technical grade (15.5% cis, 84.5% trans) allethrin. Intraperitoneal pretreatment with drugs which block noradrenergic receptors or norepinephrine synthesis, such as pentobarbital, chlorpromazine, phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine and reserpine, depressed the tremor induced by allethrin. The inhibitory effect of reserpine was reversed by phenylephrine. Both the serotonergic blocker, methysergide, and the serotonin depletor, rho-chlorphenylalanine, potentiated the effect of allethrin. The potentiating effect of methysergide was antagonized by 5-hydroxytryptamine. However, intracerebroventricular administration of methysergide was ineffective in potentiating the effect of allethrin. alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor blockers, muscarinic antagonists, GABA mimenergics and morphine had no effect. These results suggest that allethrin produces its neurotoxic responses in mice by acting on the brain and spinal levels. Furthermore, adrenergic excitatory and serotonergic inhibitory mechanisms may be involved in the neural pathway through which the allethrin-induced tremor is evoked.", 
    "3": "The effects of some sympathomimetic drugs on isolated atria of rainbow lizards (Agama agama Linn.) and land tortoises (Kinixys spp. Linn.) have been examined. Noradrenaline, adrenaline, isoprenaline, phenylephrine or dopamine (10(-9)-10(-5) M) induced concentration-dependent positive chronotropic and inotropic responses in spontaneously-beating right- and electrically-driven left atria of rainbow lizards or tortoises. These catecholamines produced similar responses in guinea-pig isolated atria. Phentolamine or propranolol (10(-10)-10(-6) M) competitively antagonised the positive chronotropic and/or positive inotropic responses induced by these sympathomimetic agonists in these reptilian (and mammalian) atrial muscles; probably suggesting the presence of alpha- and/or beta-adrenoceptors in reptilian atrial muscles (as in the mammalian myocardium). It is suggested that in reptilian atrial muscles, only one adrenoceptor subtype which is capable of converting its properties to either alpha- or beta-, or even alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor subtypes (as in the frog heart) depending on the environmental temperature, may exist. The use of rainbow lizard and tortoise atrial muscle preparations as laboratory models for routine pharmacological evaluation of adrenergic drugs, particularly in developing tropical African countries where these cheap, harmless reptiles abound, is strongly recommended.", 
    "4": "The effect of AR-L 115 BS on mechanical and electrical properties of isolated rat atria was investigated. AR-L 115 BS (10(-7) M -5 X 10(-4) M) produced a dose-dependent increase in rate, contractile force and df/dtmax and shortened the sinus node recovery time and the effective refractory period. The increase in contractile force occurred concomitantly with an increase in the height of the plateau of the atrial action potential. The positive inotropic effect produced by AR-L 115 BS depended on the external Ca concentration and was diminished in low Na solution. The drug also decreased the amplitude-interval relationship and post-extrasystolic potentiation. The positive inotropic effect of AR-L 115 BS was inhibited by verapamil and caffeine. These results suggest that in isolated rat atria the positive inotropic effect of AR-L 115 BS might be due to an increase in transmembrane Ca influx into atrial fibres as well as to an effect probably related to the inhibition of Ca sequestration by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "5": "Pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, was administered to rats to determine the effects of the drug on lipid and lipoprotein in plasma and tissues. The drug caused significant reductions in plasma triglyceride, free fatty acid and very low density lipoprotein. As for lipoprotein lipase activity, the drug produced varying effects; an increase in the heart and a reduction in the adipose tissue. No significant changes in plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed. The disturbance of growth was noted following pindolol treatment.", 
    "6": "The present investigation was designed to study the effect of 12-month therapy with pindolol on serum lipids, apoproteins A, insulin, and blood glucose levels. The concentration of serum HDL-cholesterol was increased (P less than 0.05) during the 1st month of therapy. The ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol increased slightly during therapy, but this increase was significant (P less than 0.05) only after 6 months. The total serum cholesterol level was lower (p less than 0.05) after 6 months than after 1 month of therapy. The concentrations of LDL-cholesterol showed a slight tendency to decrease during treatment. The concentrations of serum free fatty acids and triglycerides remained about constant during treatment. No significant changes in the concentrations of apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were found during the therapy with pindolol. Fasting blood glucose concentrations did not show a significant change after 12-month treatment with pindolol. During the oral glucose tolerance test, blood glucose values were raised after pindolol therapy slightly at 60 and significantly at 120 min. No significant changes in the levels of serum insulin during the glucose tolerance test were found after treatment with pindolol. Pindolol may induce glucose intolerance without impairment in insulin release. A comparison of the results of this study with previous reports on other beta blockers suggests that pindolol might have fewer untoward effects on lipid metabolism than other beta blockers.", 
    "7": "The effects of inhaling a mixture of 35 per cent carbon dioxide and 65 per cent oxygen on the occurrence of panic symptoms defined by the DSM III, was investigated. Compared to a placebo (air), carbon dioxide produced more panic symptoms. If carbon dioxide inhalation was preceded by intake of a beta-blocker (60 mg propranolol), less symptoms occurred than if preceded by a placebo. The results are compared with earlier reports on the effects of lactate infusion. It is argued that panic disorders can be conceptualized as a fear of internal (panic) sensations and that inhalation of a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen may constitute an effective exposure treatment.", 
    "8": "Insulin-stimulated glucose utilization was estimated in vivo in 1.5-, 4-, and 12-mo-old rats with an insulin suppression test wherein the height of the steady-state plasma glucose ( SSPG ) concentration, at similar steady-state plasma insulin levels, provides a direct reflection of the efficiency of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. In parallel studies, the effect of age on in vitro insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was assessed in perfused hindlimb preparations. In addition, changes in the activity of enzymes that regulate muscle glycolysis, glycogenesis, and glycogenolysis were determined in isolated soleus muscle. The results indicated that rats got heavier as they became older, and changes in weight were associated with parallel increases in mean (+/- SE) SSPG concentrations as rats grew from 1.5 (56 +/- 3 mg/dl) to 4 (172 +/- 6 mg/dl) to 12 mo of age (194 +/- 8 mg/dl). The age-related decline in in vivo insulin action was associated with a reduction in insulin action on muscle, and maximal insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by perfused hindlimbs of 12-mo-old rats was approximately 50% of the value seen with perfused hindlimbs from 1.5-mo-old rats. Soleus muscle enzyme activity also varied with age, with significant increases in glycogen synthase and decreases in glycogen phosphorylase documented. Furthermore, muscle glycogen phosphorylase activity, which fell during an insulin infusion in 1.5-mo-old rats, did not change when 12-mo-old rats were infused at comparable insulin levels. Finally, glycogen content was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in soleus muscle from 12-mo-old rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Although uncommon, hypertensive crisis must be recognized properly and quickly so that immediate treatment can be instituted to prevent serious and irreversible complications. It is important to bear in mind that it is not necessarily the absolute level of hypertension that signals impending danger but the function of an affected target organ such as the heart or kidneys that allows the physician to make the diagnosis of hypertensive crisis. There are a variety of potent antihypertensive drugs that can lower the blood pressure promptly, but the choice must be based on careful clinical and hemodynamic assessment of the patient. The goal is to lower the blood pressure and to stabilize or improve the target organ function without causing underperfusion.", 
    "10": "Protective effects of beta-blockers (oxprenolol, propranolol and carteolol) on the abnormal ECG of the sympathicotonia type were studied in male ddY SART stressed mice. Oxprenolol and carteolol were observed to have mild effects on the abnormal ECG as compared with propranolol. Experimental arrhythmias were induced by drugs in SART mice, and their frequencies of appearance were examined. The types of arrhythmias used as indices were sinus arrhythmia, supraventricular and ventricular extrasystole, the 1st and 2nd degrees of atrio-ventricular (A-V) block, sino-atrial (S-A) block and sinus standstill. The frequency of appearance of arrhythmia of any type induced by adrenaline was lower in SART mice than in normal mice. The frequency of appearance of methacholine (MCh)-induced arrhythmia of any type was significantly higher in SART mice than in normal mice. Protective effects of the 3 beta-blockers on the worsening of MCh-arrhythmias in SART mice were studied. With a single dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg, the drugs were effective on supraventricular extrasystole and S-A block. Continuous administrations of oxprenolol and carteolol inhibited the occurrence of supraventricular extrasystole, A-V block and S-A block, but not the occurrence of ventricular extrasystole. Continuous administrations of propranolol were effective on any type of arrhythmias except for sinus arrhythmia. These results further support our viewpoint that the SART mouse is of the sympathicotonia type with respect to the heart, and they suggest that oxprenolol and carteolol may be effective clinically on arrhythmias caused by autonomic imbalance.", 
    "11": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a calcium antagonist drug, diltiazem (60 mg q.i.d. per os), was compared with that of metoprolol (100 mg b.i.d. pr os) in a crossover, double-blind randomized trial in 20 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed at rest and during bicycle exercise before and after four-week periods of treatment. Both metoprolol and diltiazem reduced significantly systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while heart rate decreased only after metoprolol therapy. The reduction in blood pressure and the percentage of patients who responded favorably were similar with the two drugs. Furthermore, the overall levels of blood pressure during exercise were significantly reduced by both treatments, while only metoprolol was able to reduce the maximum increase in systolic blood pressure and heart rate induced by exercise. These results suggest that the use of diltiazem may be appropriate to the treatment of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "12": "To study whether specific beta-adrenergic mechanisms contribute to the hypoglycaemic activation of gastrin and gastric acid secretion, the effects of racemic and dextroisomer propranolol (0.1 mg/kg, intravenously) were studied during insulin tests (0.2 IU/kg) in 13 persons. dl-Propranolol inhibited the gastrin response to hypoglycaemia markedly and more than the insignificant alteration observed after d-propranolol. Gastric acid response to hypoglycaemia was significantly reduced by dl-propranolol and not by d-propranolol. The findings demonstrate that non-beta-adrenergic effects of propranolol on the stomach are minor and that specific beta-adrenergic mechanisms are directly or indirectly involved in the hypoglycaemic stimulation of the stomach.", 
    "13": "To the extent that they have deficient glucagon secretory responses to plasma glucose decrements, as they commonly do, patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) are dependent on epinephrine-mediated beta-adrenergic mechanisms to promote recovery from hypoglycemia. Thus, they are at increased risk for prolonged hypoglycemia if treated with a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist such as propranolol. If the hyperglycemic actions of epinephrine are mediated through beta 2-adrenergic mechanisms, therapeutic efficacy (e.g., for hypertension or ischemic heart disease) could be accomplished without increased risk of hypoglycemia by selective beta 1-adrenergic blockade in such patients. However, oral administration of the relatively selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist metoprolol (100 mg) and of the nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (80 mg) both impaired recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia in patients with IDDM. Thus, at a dose of 100 mg, oral metoprolol is not safer than oral propranolol with respect to recovery from hypoglycemia in patients with IDDM.", 
    "14": "The importance of number of tablets for patient compliance was investigated in 160 patients with mild-moderate essential hypertension treated with a beta-adrenoceptor blocker and a thiazide diuretic. Mean BP at entry 146 +/- 16/92 +/- 8 mm Hg. All patients were given pindolol 10 mg and clopamide 5 mg in one combination tablet or in separate tablets for 4 months respectively. Approximately 90% of the patients took greater than 90% of the prescribed dose throughout the study. Mean BP decreased progressively and heart rate increased slightly. Side effects were more frequently reported during the first month of the study than previously, and 30 patients discontinued the treatment. No differences in this respect were seen between 1 and 2 tablets daily. Approximately 75% of the patients preferred 1 tablet daily, but combining two drugs in one tablet had no effect upon compliance.", 
    "15": "We have previously reported the results of a controlled trial showing that continuous oral administration of propranolol reduced the risk of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis; only part of our patients had been followed for 1 year. This controlled trial was continued for an additional year; accordingly, all of our patients have now been followed for at least 2 years. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether prolonged administration enhances the efficacy of this therapy. Seventy-four patients with cirrhosis, admitted for an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, were included in this study; ascites, jaundice and encephalopathy were absent or mild and transient. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups; one group of 38 patients received propranolol twice daily at doses that reduced the resting heart rate by 25%, the other group of 36 patients received a placebo twice daily. The cumulative percentages of patients free of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding 1 and 2 years after inclusion were 87 and 79% in the propranolol group, and 42 and 32% in the placebo group; both differences were highly significant (p less than 0.0001). Furthermore, the cumulative percentages of surviving patients 1 and 2 years after inclusion were 94 and 90% in the propranolol group, and 84 and 57% in the placebo group; the difference between the two groups was not significant at 1 year, but was statistically significant at 2 years (p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "In a double blind study of metoprolol in the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction 698 patients (study group) received metoprolol and 697 a placebo (control group). Metoprolol was given in an intravenous dose of 15 mg as soon as possible after admission to hospital followed by 50 g by mouth four times a day for two days and thereafter 100 mg twice a day for three months. A placebo was similarly given. Congestive heart failure occurred in a similar percentage of patients in both the study (27%) and the control groups (30%). Its severity was estimated by calculating the total dose of frusemide given during the first four days in hospital. Less frusemide was given to patients treated with metoprolol compared with those given a placebo in the total series. An appreciably lower total dose of frusemide was given to patients included in the trial less than or equal to 12 hours after the onset of pain and treated with metoprolol compared with a placebo, while no difference was seen among patients treated later. The initial heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and infarct site affected the results.", 
    "17": "In the pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized rat, hemorrhage of blood equivalent to 1% body weight (18.4% blood volume) increases plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration and also markedly elevates jejunal ion and water absorption. Infusion of angiotensin II (AII) also stimulates jejunal absorption, and in a manner similar to hemorrhage. The elevation of jejunal absorption in response to hemorrhage is not affected by removal of the adrenals but is totally inhibited by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and by bilateral nephrectomy. Thus, increased jejunal absorption following hemorrhage is mediated by the renin-angiotensin system and is not secondary to aldosterone release. Further experiments demonstrated that norepinephrine released from enteric sympathetic nerves controls jejunal absorption through activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of jejunal absorption by tyramine was unaffected by propranolol but was totally abolished by phentolamine and by peripheral sympathectomy was 6-hydroxydopamine (intact adrenal medulla). The increase in jejunal absorption in response to hemorrhage also was unaffected by propranolol but was inhibited totally by phentolamine, prazosin, and peripheral sympathectomy. It is proposed that AII generated by hemorrhage facilitates norepinephrine release from enteric sympathetic nerves. The norepinephrine released by AII stimulates jejunal absorption by enhancing transepithelial transport processes or by altering the balance of Starling forces governing fluid absorption across enteric capillaries.", 
    "18": "The effect of alpha, beta, or combined sympathetic blockade on the increase in energy expenditure and concentrations of norepinephrine, glucose, and insulin following oral intake of 100 g of glucose was studied in lean subjects. Alpha blockade with intravenous (IV) phentolamine (n = 5) infusion increased oxygen consumption after glucose ingestion but no more than it increased the oxygen consumption when no glucose was given. Beta blockade with IV propranolol (n = 13) and combined alpha and beta blockade (n = 6) did not affect basal metabolic rate or the increase in metabolic rate after glucose ingestion. Phentolamine or combined propranolol plus phentolamine administration markedly increased plasma norepinephrine concentrations. Basal glucose and insulin concentrations were not affected by any of the infused drugs. Glucose-stimulated insulin concentrations were unchanged by propranolol and combined blockade, whereas there was a trend (P = 0.07) toward an increased response to glucose during phentolamine administration. These data do not support a role for the sympathetic nervous system in the increase in metabolic rate following glucose ingestion. The increase in metabolic rate during phentolamine administration can be attributed to beta adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "19": "This study characterizes the electrophysiologic effects of the alpha agonist phenylephrine on the rabbit sinus node. Phenylephrine increased sinus node firing rate and increased slope of Phase 4 depolarization. It shortened action potential duration. It had no effect on maximum diastolic potential or action potential amplitude. These actions were blocked by propranolol. These data imply phenylephrine may exert an effect on the sinus node through a beta-adrenoreceptor.", 
    "20": "To test the hypothesis that alterations in adrenergic or cholinergic receptors occur in response to physical training, and that changes in receptor properties could be mechanistically important in producting the altered cardiovascular physiology of the trained state, we studied the effects of endurance training by swimming upon beta adrenergic, alpha adrenergic, and muscarinic cholinergic receptors of rat heart. Because of previously reported sex-related differences in the cardiac adaptation to training, male and female rats were studied separately. Despite the occurrence of demonstrable training bradycardia in males, and of cardiac hypertrophy in females, there were no discernible effects of the training program upon the properties of cardiac beta adrenergic receptors. However, hearts from swimmers of both sexes demonstrated fewer numbers of muscarinic cholinergic and alpha adrenergic receptors than sedentary controls, without differences in the receptor affinities for antagonist or agonist compounds. These findings are inconsistent with the hypothesis that altered cardiac sensitivity to neurotransmitters contributes directly to training bradycardia.", 
    "21": "The mechanism of the cyclic AMP-independent positive inotropic effect of cardiac alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation was studied by analyzing the effects of phenylephrine on force of contraction, calcium-dependent slow action potentials and the slow inward current (Isi) in bovine ventricular trabeculae. The preparations were electrically driven at 0.3 Hz in the presence of propranolol 1 mumol 1(-1). Phenylephrine increased the force of contraction in a concentration-dependent manner (maximum about 200% of control at 30 mumol 1(-1). The effect was surmountably antagonized by phentolamine. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine was accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase in time to peak force and occurred without any detectable increase in cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) levels. The positive inotropic effect of phenylephrine was accompanied by an increase in action potential duration both at 20% and 90% repolarization. Calcium-dependent slow action potentials were also prolonged by phenylephrine and there was a distinct increase in the maximal rate of depolarization (dV/dtmax) of these slow potentials. These effects were also completely reversible on washing and surmountably blocked by phentolamine. However, the increase in dV/dtmax was smaller than that of isoprenaline in concentrations producing similar inotropic effects. Voltage-clamp experiments with the single sucrose-gap method showed that the phenylephrine-induced increase in force of contraction was associated not only with an increase in peak slow calcium inward current, Isi max, but also with a delay in the inactivation of Isi. Outward currents were not detectably altered by phenylephrine. It is concluded that the alpha-adrenoceptor mediated, cyclic AMP-independent positive inotropic effects of phenylephrine in bovine cardiac muscle are associated with an increase in slow inward current. Additionally, the amount of calcium influx during excitation is probably increased by a delay in the inactivation of Isi. Both effects can explain the phenylephrine-produced prolongation of the action potential, and probably contribute to the positive inotropic effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation. However, as the effect on dV/dtmax is smaller than that of isoprenaline, other (still unknown) mechanisms may also be involved.", 
    "22": "The effects of estradiol (1 microgram: E-1) treatment on uterine hyperemia and uterine sensitivity to various biogenic compounds were evaluated in ovariectomized (OVX) animals treated with either sesame oil or E-1 for 3 days. The E-1 treatments induced significant elevations in uterine weight, blood flow, and alpha- and beta-receptor numbers as compared with oil-treated controls. In contrast, uterine norepinephrine (NE) levels were reduced in E-1-treated, OVX guinea pigs as compared with oil-treated controls. Uterine sensitivity and responsivity to NE (10(-6) M) and acetylcholine (ACH: 10(-8) M) were either comparable to, or enhanced, in E-1-treated animals as compared with controls. In particular, combined ACH-NE treatment induced a dramatic increase in contraction force in E-1-treated uteri as compared with uteri from oil-treated animals. The use of specific adrenergic alpha- (phentolamine: 10(-6) M) or beta- (propranolol: 10(-6) M) receptor blocking agents indicated that the estrogenic response was mediated via the alpha-adrenergic receptor complex. Since atropine (10(-8) M) effectively blocked the cholinergic accentuation of this uterine response, it is suggested that a cholinergic priming, or beta-receptor block, is necessary for the full expression of the alpha-adrenergic-mediated, estrogenic response in the guinea pig. The estrogen-associated increase in available alpha- and beta-receptors and depressed tissue NE levels probably account for both the hyperemic response and enhanced tissue sensitivity to biogenic compounds in the guinea pig.", 
    "23": "The effects of three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, metoprolol and atenolol) on the serum kinetics and pharmacodynamics of warfarin given in a single oral dose (15 mg) were studied in six normal subjects. At the same degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, as assessed by the decrease of exercise tachycardia, propranolol increased the area under the serum warfarin concentration time curve (AUC) by 16.3 +/- 14.2 s.d.% (P less than 0.01) and the maximum serum warfarin concentration by 23.0 +/- 14.3 s.d.% (P less than 0.001). Atenolol increased the maximum serum warfarin concentration by 12.5 +/- 12.3% s.d. (P less than 0.05) but was without effect on warfarin AUC. Metoprolol had no effect on warfarin kinetics. The extent of changes in the prothrombin time and the plasma clotting Factor VII activity caused by warfarin were not altered by any of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.", 
    "24": "Fourteen patients with cirrhosis and bleeding esophageal varices were treated with propranolol. The dose of propranolol was determined by decreasing the resting heart rate by 25% 12 hr after an oral dose of propranolol which was given twice a day. Significant decreases in the hepatic venous pressure gradient and cardiac output after 1 month of propranolol administration was observed. To assess beta-adrenergic blockade, the isoproterenol test and plasma propranolol levels were evaluated. Increasing doses of isoproterenol were injected to increase the resting heart rate 25 beats per minute (chronotropic dose 25 or CD25 ). Plasma propranolol concentrations were measured in blood samples drawn 4 hr after the last oral dose. The mean CD25 was 5 +/- 2 micrograms before and 146 +/- 84 micrograms after 1 month of propranolol administration. The plasma propranolol level after 1 month of drug administration was 0.69 +/- 0.47 microM per liter i.e. 2.33 +/- 1.59 micrograms per ml. A significant correlation was found between the CD25 measured after continuous propranolol administration and plasma propranolol level. In conclusion, the efficacy of beta-adrenergic blockade was estimated by the isoproterenol test which correlates with the plasma propranolol level in patients with cirrhosis. This study suggests that the isoproterenol test is useful in assessing beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol in patients with cirrhosis.", 
    "25": "Previous in vivo findings indicated that alpha-adrenergic blocking agents enhanced tolbutamide-induced insulin secretion, whereas beta-blockade attenuated it. In the present study, the interaction of tolbutamide and glyburide with the rat islet adrenergic receptors is examined directly by determining the effectiveness of these drugs to displace the specific alpha- and beta-adrenergic radioligands, [3H]-clonidine and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA). It was found that both tolbutamide and glyburide had affinity constants for the adrenergic receptors that were similar to those for the natural receptor ligands and powerful antagonists. Tolbutamide displaced both alpha- and beta-radioligands but had a higher affinity at the beta-receptor. Glyburide also displaced radioligands from both types of receptors but had a higher affinity for the alpha-receptor. This study suggests that these two sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents may affect insulin secretion by different mechanisms.", 
    "26": "Prenalterol, a beta1 agonist, was given in a single blind acute intravenous study to seven patients with cardiac failure (New York Heart Association class II and III). It was then given in a double blind crossover study of sustained oral prenalterol to six of them. As a result of dose titration studies the oral dose of prenalterol given was 100 mg twice a day in all patients. Erect bicycle sprint tests were performed to exercise tolerance before and after treatment had been started. Cardiac function was assessed at rest and during graded supine bicycle exercise by determining haemodynamic indices using a Swan-Ganz catheter and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fractions. In the intravenous study cardiac function was assessed at rest and during exercise after a control infusion of dextrose and after an infusion of 5 mg prenalterol. In the oral crossover study a placebo or prenalterol were given for two periods of two weeks; at the end of each period exercise tolerance was measured and cardiac function assessed at rest and during exercise. Throughout the study period there was no change in symptoms, medication, or exercise tolerance. Intravenous prenalterol significantly improved cardiac function; left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac index increased and left ventricular filling pressure fell both at rest and during exercise. Sustained oral treatment with prenalterol, however, did not improve resting left ventricular filling pressure or left ventricular ejection fraction at rest or during exercise but did increase heart rate at rest, and mean blood pressure and peripheral vascular resistance at rest and during exercise; in fact, during exercise left ventricular filling pressure was significantly increased while cardiac index and stroke volume index were decreased by prenalterol. Sustained oral treatment with prenalterol did not have the beneficial effects on cardiac function produced by intravenous treatment and in fact had deleterious effect on the measured indices of cardiac function during exercise.", 
    "27": "We used a recently developed preparation of calcium-tolerant isolated rat cardiac ventricular cells to investigate certain aspects of hormone-mediated protein phosphorylation in heart tissue. Isoproterenol or dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) promoted the phosphorylation of at least 13 proteins and promoted the dephosphorylation of a single protein of relative molecular weight (Mr) 21,000, whose phosphorylation appeared to be stimulated by insulin. The isoproterenol-induced protein phosphorylations reached maximum levels for most proteins within 5 min at slightly different rates. However, when excess propranolol was added to the cells after exposure to isoproterenol, there appeared to be two major patterns of dephosphorylation: proteins that remained fully phosphorylated after propranolol addition, exemplified by proteins tentatively identified as troponin I and C-protein, and proteins that were rapidly dephosphorylated after propranolol, exemplified by phospholamban, the modulator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-dependent ATPase. The Mr 21,000 protein was rapidly dephosphorylated in response to isoproterenol and was rephosphorylated after addition of propranolol. This protein remains unidentified; it is not the Mr 19,000 myosin light chain whose phosphorylation state was unaffected by isoproterenol. This preparation of isolated heart cells provides a convenient way to investigate the biochemical effects resulting from exposure of the heart to hormones and can separate direct hormonal effects from those resulting from changes in contractility or heart rate.", 
    "28": "Decreased activity of the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (N) of the adenylate cyclase system is present in cell membranes of some patients with pseudohypoparathyrodism (PHP-Ia) whereas others have normal activity of N (PHP-Ib). Low N activity in PHP-Ia results in a decrease in hormone (H)-stimulatable adenylate cyclase in various tissues, which might be due to decreased ability to form an agonist-specific high affinity complex composed of H, receptor (R), and N. To test this hypothesis, we compared beta-adrenergic agonist-specific binding properties in erythrocyte membranes from five patients with PHP-Ia (N = 45% of control), five patients with PHP-Ib (N = 97%), and five control subjects. Competition curves that were generated by increasing concentrations of the beta-agonist isoproterenol competing with [125I]pindolol were shallow (slope factors less than 1) and were computer fit to a two-state model with corresponding high and low affinity for the agonist. The agonist competition curves from the PHP-Ia patients were shifted significantly (P less than 0.02) to the right as a result of a significant (P less than 0.01) decrease in the percent of beta-adrenergic receptors in the high affinity state from 64 +/- 22% in PHP-Ib and 56 +/- 5% in controls to 10 +/- 8% in PHP-Ia. The agonist competition curves were computer fit to a \"ternary complex\" model for the two-step reaction: H + R + N in equilibrium HR + N in equilibrium HRN. The modeling was consistent with a 60% decrease in the functional concentration of N, and was in good agreement with the biochemically determined decrease in erythrocyte N protein activity. These in vitro findings in erythrocytes taken together with the recent observations that in vivo isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity is decreased in patients with PHP (Carlson, H. E., and A. S. Brickman, 1983, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 56:1323-1326) are consistent with the notion that N is a bifunctional protein interacting with both R and the adenylate cyclase. It may be that in patients with PHP-Ia a single molecular and genetic defect accounts for both decreased HRN formation and decreased adenylate cyclase activity, whereas in PHP-Ib the biochemical lesion(s) appear not to affect HRN complex formation.", 
    "29": "To assess the physiological relevance of the changes in adrenergic receptor observed in adipocyte membranes after in vitro exposure to catecholamines, hamster white adipocytes, which possess both beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors, were studied after a 6-day in vivo epinephrine administration (1 mg/kg, daily). This treatment resulted in a 3-fold increase in total plasma catecholamine levels and in the following changes in the adipocytes. The lipolytic and cAMP responses to beta-agonists, ACTH, and theophylline were decreased by 55-60%, but the sensitivity of these responses to (-)isoproterenol was unchanged. Although basal adenylate cyclase activity was unaffected, (-)isoproterenol-, ACTH- or fluoride-stimulated activities were reduced by half, a defect which persisted in the presence of guanosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate. Furthermore, the number of beta-adrenergic receptors was also decreased by 54%. In contrast, epinephrine treatment failed to impair the adipocyte antilipolytic response to the alpha 2-agonist clonidine, the alpha 2-component of epinephrine, and the adenosine analog N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, the adenylate cyclase inhibitory response to these compounds, and the number of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. These results indicate that in vivo epinephrine administration does not alter the alpha 2-adrenergic system of hamster white adipocyte, but desensitizes the lipolytic response to beta-agonists and also to nonadrenergic lipolytic agents. It is therefore suggested that the likely mechanism(s) responsible for this lipolysis desensitization mainly consists in impaired adenylate cyclase coupling and possibly in altered intracellular processes, rather than in the observed beta-adrenergic receptor down-regulation.", 
    "30": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that rats trained with marked reductions in exercise heart rate respond with adaptations indicative of increased intrinsic myocardial performance. Therefore, we measured changes in maximum work capacity (VO2max), biochemical-functional indexes of cardiac contractile capacity, and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in normal-trained (NT) rats and in rats trained while receiving the selective cardiac beta 1-blocking drug atenolol (AT). Training consisted of treadmill running at approximately 80% VO2max (untrained) for 1-h duration, 6 days/wk, for a total of 8 wk. Exercise heart rate of the AT group was markedly reduced and averaged 140 beats/min below the NT group for any given session. Compared with sedentary controls, VO2max was increased by 11%, and red vastus lateralis muscle citrate synthase activity was increased by 28% in both AT and NT groups (P less than 0.05). There were no differences between trained and nontrained groups with regard to Ca2+-regulated myofibril adenosinetriphosphatase. In situ derived left ventricular pressure and the maximum rate of left ventricular pressure development were not augmented relative to sedentary control values when the trained hearts were either stimulated inotropically or maximally afterloaded . These findings suggest that maximum exercise capacity can be enhanced in rodents conditioned with and without limited elevation in exercise heart rate; however, this reduction of exercise heart rate acceleration does not provide a stimulus to enhance the intrinsic functional capacity of the rodent heart.", 
    "31": "Different alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists: RX 781094, yohimbine and rauwolscine (selective alpha 2-adrenergic antagonists); mianserin (tetracyclic anti-depressant, antagonist at alpha 2-presynaptic autoreceptors) and prazosin (selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist) were used at concentrations ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-4) M, to reverse clonidine inhibition of MIX-stimulated lipolysis in the hamster fat cell. In this adipose tissue (like human but unlike rat) there co-exist prolipolytic beta-adrenoceptors and antilipolytic alpha-adrenoceptors. Although no effects were observed with prazosin, RX 781094 was ten times more potent than yohimbine or its isomer rauwolscine in reversing clonidine inhibition of the MIX-stimulated lipolysis. Mianserin was an effective blocker only from a concentration of 10(-4) M, consistent with its relative lack of specificity for alpha 2-adrenoceptors cited elsewhere. Overall these results confirm the utility of this model for testing compounds presumed to act at alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "32": "Ten male patients with chronic stable angina pectoris completed a randomized, double-blind cross-over study, with matched placebo run-in period (P), to compare the effects of a long-acting preparation of propranolol (LA, 160 mg once a day) with that of conventional propranolol (CP, 40 mg four times a day) each given for 14 days. Response was assessed by symptom-limited bicycle ergometry, degree of ST segment depression, daily anginal attack rate and glyceryl trinitrin consumption (GTN). Heart rate and ventricular extra-systolic frequency (VES) were recorded by 24 h Holter monitor. Bicycle ergometry was performed and a trough blood sample taken for propranolol estimation on day 14 prior to the morning dose. Both formulations increased total work capacity (P 3412, LA 4095, CP 3697 kpm/min), reduced rate-pressure product (P 21896, LA 16011, CP 15609 mm Hg beats/min), and degree of ST segment depression (P 4.53, LA 2.48, CP 2.43), but without differences between the formulations. Daily anginal attack rate was reduced from 30 (placebo) to 7.5 (CP) and 14.5 (LA) (P less than 0.05 between treatment groups). There was a reduction in daily GTN consumption by both treatments. The heart rate and total number of VESs during 24 h was similar in the two treatment groups and was reduced in comparison with placebo. Both formulations were well tolerated. Long-acting propranolol is an effective and well-tolerated alternative to conventional propranolol in the treatment of chronic stable and stress-induced angina, and in reducing VES frequency.", 
    "33": "To evaluate timolol's ability to antagonize the \"slow response\" in cardiac tissues, isolated canine cardiac Purkinje fibers were exposed to 0.25 mM barium chloride to induce membrane depolarization, spontaneous automaticity, and slow response action potentials. The effects of timolol on action potential parameters and the cycle length of spontaneous automaticity were tested at concentrations of 10, 100, and 500 micrograms/ml. Timolol significantly depressed the action potential and slowed automaticity only at 100 and 500 micrograms/ml but not at 10 micrograms/ml. Since verapamil and nifedipine have been reported to completely suppress activity in this model at concentrations of 0.2-2.0 micrograms/ml, we conclude that timolol has little direct slow response blocking potency.", 
    "34": "Prenalterol was examined with regard to its acute intravenous effects on left ventricular function, coronary hemodynamics, and myocardial oxygen consumption, as well as for its long-term effects, by oral therapy, on left ventricular function and systemic hemodynamics. Intravenous prenalterol enhances myocardial contractility and left ventricular ejection function significantly. A decrease in total peripheral vascular resistance is effected. Myocardial oxygen consumption is only moderately increased, most probably because of the decrease in the systolic integrated wall stress of the left ventricle. The changes of coronary circulation (blood flow, resistance, arteriovenous, oxygen difference) indicate benign and metabolically induced coronary vasodilation. Long-term oral treatment of patients with severe cardiac failure by prenalterol effects significant enhancement in-left ventricular performance within the first 1-2 months of treatment; however, this effect is not present at longer therapy intervals (16-28 weeks). Tolerance development as well as the natural history of these patients may be responsible for this inotropic amelioration. There were no clinical side effects with either intravenous or oral application. It may be concluded that prenalterol is highly effective in acute cardiac failure (intravenous administration) and also in chronic heart disease (long-term oral application). However, the long-term effects are unpredictable, and tolerance development has to be considered.", 
    "35": "We examined the effects of beta-blockade with the nonselective antagonist propranolol, the cardioselective antagonist atenolol, and the cardioselective antagonist with partial agonist activity, practolol, on the levels of free arachidonic acid (AA), thromboxane B2 (TxB2), prostaglandin (PG) E2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in plasma, and TxB2 production by platelets during clotting in six normal subjects during submaximal dynamic exercise. The drugs were given intravenously in equipotent increasing doses before the exercise test. Exercise induced a clear increase in AA, TxB2, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in plasma. During the first 60 min of exercise all three beta-blockers decreased the plasma levels of AA and TxB2. Propranolol (0.19 mg/kg) was slightly more effective than atenolol (0.19 mg/kg) or practolol (0.64 mg/kg); however, at exhaustion, propranolol was markedly more effective than the other two blockers. Plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGE2 levels were less affected by beta-blockade during exercise, and no significant effect was seen on TxB2 formation by platelets. The plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TxB2 ratio was markedly higher after propranolol treatment than after treatment with the other two blockers during the exercise period. These results suggest that the capability of a nonselective blocker to inhibit both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors may be of advantage because of the more effective inhibition of thromboxane formation than with a cardioselective blocker, especially when the sympathetic tone is markedly increased.", 
    "36": "Simultaneous hemodynamic and equilibrium radionuclide function measurements were performed at rest and during exercise before and 75 min after oral administration of 30 mg bufuralol, a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, in 10 patients with stable angina pectoris. Acute beta-blockade with bufuralol resulted in a reduction of exercise-stimulated heart rate, Systolic blood pressure, and cardiac index. There was, however, also a fall in diastolic blood pressure and end-diastolic volume index, and an improved global left ventricular ejection fraction, without a change in total vascular resistance, suggesting an acute vasodilator effect. regional analysis revealed that this beneficial effect was particularly present in ischemic segments of the left ventricular wall where regional function increased. Thus, bufuralol is a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent with additional peripheral vasodilating properties.", 
    "37": "We examined the effects of prolonged oral administration of oxprenolol (twice daily for 6 weeks) to male Sprague-Dawley rats. At two times (1 or 16-18 h) after the last oral dose, the rats were anaesthetised and subjected to acute coronary artery ligation, and the severity of the resulting arrhythmias was assessed. Ischaemic damage was measured histochemically (using frozen section analysis by toluidine blue dye in nitrobluetetrazolium ) and by myocardial enzyme release. Cardiac muscle (atria and papillary muscle) was also removed and the transmembrane action potentials recorded using conventional microelectrode techniques. When coronary artery ligation was performed 1 h after the last oral dose (at which time there was evidence of substantial myocardial beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade), there was significant reduction in the severity of early arrhythmias, but no evidence that the severity of ischaemic damage was reduced or that the intracellular cardiac action potentials were modified. No protection was observed when coronary artery ligation was carried out 16 h after the last oral dose of oxprenolol. These results support our previous studies with acutely administered beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs that myocardial beta-adrenoceptor blockade is the main factor involved in the protection afforded by such drugs against early ischaemic arrhythmias and that other possible effects, such as membrane stabilisation and action potential prolongation, are relatively unimportant in this model.", 
    "38": "In this study of nervous control of exocrine secretion, electrical field stimulation (FS) evoked a marked, tetrodotoxin-sensitive increase in the amylase output from in vitro segments of rat pancreas. Blockade of the large cholinergic component of the response by atropine revealed a smaller noncholinergic nerve-mediated secretion. This noncholinergic secretion was unaffected by phentolamine but abolished by propranolol, as were the secretory responses to norepinephrine and other beta-adrenergic agonists. FS also produced an increase in the efflux of radiolabeled norepinephrine from preloaded tissue that was tetrodotoxin sensitive and calcium dependent. Although FS and the adrenergic secretagogues had no effect on 45Ca2+ metabolism or acinar cell electrical properties of atropine-treated rat pancreas, they both evoked increases in tissue cAMP levels. These increases in cAMP concentration were also blocked by propranolol. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine potentiated both the elevation of cAMP levels and the amylase secretion evoked by adrenergic stimulation. Since both specific beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic agonists elevated cAMP levels and caused amylase secretion, it appears that both beta-receptor subtypes are present in the rat pancreas. Of the selective beta 1- and beta 2-antagonists used, the most pronounced reduction, but not complete blockade, of the FS- and norepinephrine-induced cyclic nucleotide and secretory effects was obtained with the beta 1-antagonist metoprolol. It is concluded that stimulation of adrenergic nerves in the rat pancreas evokes an amylase secretion that is mediated via the activation of mainly beta 1-type adrenergic receptors and the utilization of cAMP as an intracellular second messenger.", 
    "39": "Isoproterenol-induced amylase release from rabbit parotid acini was examined in relation to cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentrations, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) activity ratios and protein phosphorylation. Initial stimulation of amylase release by isoproterenol was preceded by increases in cAMP, cAMP-PK activity ratios and phosphorylation of a 34,000 MW (major) and a 30,000 MW (minor) protein in the microsomal fraction. When propranolol was added, decreases in cAMP concentrations and cAMP-PK activity ratios preceded the reduction in amylase release. Detailed analysis was performed on the 34,000 MW protein. The relation of dephosphorylation of protein 34 and reduction in amylase release was complex. Slight dephosphorylation occurred before or concurrently with the decrease in amylase release; however, maximal dephosphorylation was preceded by maximal inhibition of amylase release. When secretion of amylase was reinstituted by isoproterenol or forskolin, increases in cAMP and cAMP-PK activity ratios occurred before or in concert with amylase release but rephosphorylation of protein 34 occurred after the start of amylase release. Photoaffinity labeling studies using [32P]-8-azidoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate indicated that proteins 34 and 30 were not regulatory subunits of cAMP-PK or their breakdown products. Although these data are consistent with phosphorylation of proteins 34 or 30 being required for triggering initial secretion, maximum dephosphorylation was not essential for inhibition of secretion. Furthermore, initiation of amylase release by the gland after a short period of quiescence did not depend on prior phosphorylation of protein 34. These data may indicate the absence of a requirement of amylase release for phosphorylation of protein 34.", 
    "40": "Lungs obtained from guinea pigs actively sensitized to ovalbumin were minced and prepared for histamine release studies. The effects of selective beta adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists on the ovalbumin dose-response curve for histamine release were quantified. Beta agonist dose-response curves for inhibiting histamine release evoked by low, medium and maximum antigen concentrations as well as for shifting the antigen dose-response curve to the right were obtained. All experiments were conducted in the presence of phenoxybenzamine, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and tissues were taken from reserpine-pretreated animals. The beta agonists isoproterenol and sulfonterol inhibited antigen-induced histamine release, whereas the beta-1 selective agonist, ICI 118587, had no effect at concentrations up to 10(-5) M. The beta-1 selective agonist R0363 inhibited histamine release only at concentrations known to activate the beta-2-type receptor. The maximum responses and potencies of isoproterenol and sulfonterol were inversely related to the concentration of ovalbumin at which the response was measured. The -log molar ED50 values of isoproterenol and sulfonterol were decreased approximately 10- and 5-fold, respectively, by increasing the antigen concentration from 10(-3) to 1 mg/ml. Therefore, the potency of sulfonterol relative to isoproterenol changed with antigen concentration. The beta antagonists propranolol, butoxamine and practolol did not alter antigen-induced histamine release when incubated with the tissue for 60 min. Apparent dissociation constants (KB) for propranolol and butoxamine were independent of the concentration of antigen used to provoke histamine release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "The influence of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on detrusor, trigone, bladder neck and urethral smooth muscle from human and pig was investigated in vitro. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide reduced the tension and amplitude of the spontaneous contractions of strips from all regions studied. Human detrusor and pig trigone, bladder neck and urethral strips were more sensitive to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide than pig detrusor. The response was reversible, reproducible and dose-dependent from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol. per liter. The time to onset of the response was within 1/2 minute and the time to maximal relaxation was 2 to 10 minutes. The response was not affected by selective nerve poisoning with tetrodotoxin, beta-adrenergic blockade with propanolol or prostaglandin synthesis blockade with ketoprofen. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide did not prevent prostaglandin E2 activity on the musculature. Contractions evoked by transmural electric field stimulation or pharmacologically with carbachol, noradrenaline, substance P and prostaglandin F2 alpha were equally reduced by VIP 10(-7) mol. per liter.", 
    "42": "The recognition that patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death can be identified raises our enthusiasm to eliminate some of these risk factors and thus our hope to prevent sudden cardiac death. Although this effect is yet to be shown in cooperative, well-controlled clinical trials, data exist to suggest that this result will be achieved. Thus, the use of antiarrhythmic agents in chronic ventricular ectopy, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, seems to be warranted, and new and more potent agents to be used for this end will be available in the future.", 
    "43": "Male ddY mice were loaded with restraint and water immersion stress (RWIS) for 1 hr, and their ECG was measured by lead II. A considerable decrease of heart rate and remarkable prolongations of PQ, QT and QRS intervals were observed in the ECG of RWIS mice. Then experimental arrhythmias were induced by methacholine or adrenaline (Adr) on RWIS mice, and their frequencies of appearance were examined. The appearances of methacholine-induced ventricular extrasystole, atrio-ventricular (A-V) block, sino-atrial (S-A) block and sinus standstill were higher in RWIS mice than in normal mice, and the appearances of sinus arrhythmia and supraventricular extrasystole were similar to normal mice. The appearance of Adr-induced arrhythmia of any type was significantly higher in RWIS mice than in normal mice. Then protective effects of 3 beta-blockers, oxprenolol, propranolol and carteolol, on the worsening of Adr-induced arrhythmias on RWIS mice were studied. A single administration of 5 or 10 mg/kg of oxprenolol or 5 mg/kg of propranolol inhibited the appearance of extrasystole and A-V block. The effectiveness of three-times administrations of 1 approximately 10 mg/kg of oxprenolol was similar to that of the single administration. These results suggest that oxprenolol shows a strong antiarrhythmic effect by continuous administrations on chronic syndromes in SART mice, and it shows an immediate effect by a single administration on acute syndromes in RWIS mice.", 
    "44": "The need to treat severe and repetitive arrhythmias which are often resistant to treatment with single different drugs has led to an increasing interest towards associations of antiarrhythmic drugs. The advantages of this associations could be: enhancing effect of different pharmacological properties, synergism, reduction of doses and side-effects. The risks are: induction or aggravation of excitability and conduction disturbances, impairment of contractility, hypotension, interaction with digoxin. This study describes our experience in using associations of antiarrhythmic drugs of different classes (IA + II, IA + III, IB + III) or of the same class (IA). We also report our preliminary results with the use of Propafenon-Amiodarone association in the acute treatment of electrophysiologically induced ventricular tachycardias and in the chronic treatment of repetitive and symptomatic ventricular tachycardias. Our experience demonstrates that the association of antiarrhythmic drugs is effective in the treatment of severe and repetitive arrhythmias only if the patients are carefully selected and the risks of unwelcome electrophysiological actions and side-effects are taken into account.", 
    "45": "The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of an antimuscarinic drug, ganglionic blocking agent, alpha and beta adrenergic blocking drug, antiserotonin agent or antihistamine upon salivation produced by nicotine similarly injected in the cat was investigated. Atropine and hexamethonium abolished the salivation evoked by nicotine. On the other hand, salivation induced by nicotine was not significantly altered by yohimbine, practolol, methysergide and antazoline. It is concluded that the salivation produced by nicotine is mediated via central receptors which have mixed nicotinic and muscarinic properties.", 
    "46": "Adrenaline, noradrenaline, isoproterenol, dopamine, dobutamine and prenalterol, all stimulate ventricular contractility be increasing the cAMP. It is important to understand their cardiac and peripheral effects so that they can be used rationally. Over recent years, these drugs have changed the course of many patients, often in a critical state.", 
    "47": "We tried to find functional evidence for the existence of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in the isolated guinea-pig lung parenchymal strip preparation, using potent and selective beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. To obtain potent beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation the nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline was combined with a highly selective beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist--ICI 118,551. Potent beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation was obtained by procaterol. Practolol (beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and ICI 118,551 were used as antagonists. ICI 118,551, 10(-7) mol/l, shifted the concentration response (C/R) curve of isoprenaline to a higher concentration range. The C/R curve of procaterol was shifted in the same way and to the same degree by this concentration of ICI 118,551. The C/R curve of isoprenaline was not further shifted after blockade with a combination of ICI 118,551, 10(-7) mol/l, and practolol, 10(-6). However, in the trachea preparation, a tissue containing both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors, there was a further shift of the C/R curve of isoprenaline to a higher concentration range after blockade with a combination of ICI 118,551 and practolol in the concentrations given above. In this preparation the shift of the C/R curve of procaterol was ten times greater than that of isoprenaline after blockade with ICI 118,551, 10(-7) mol/l. We conclude that it is possible to characterize small fractions of beta 1-adrenoceptors coexisting with beta 2-adrenoceptors with the technique used. Furthermore there is still no functional evidence of the existence of beta 1-adrenoceptors in the lung parenchyma.", 
    "48": "Electrical stimulation (3 Hz, 2 msec duration, 5-12 V for 2 min every 20 min) of cortical slices from the rat, previously incubated with [3H]noradrenaline, evoked a release of tritium which was inhibited by morphine, normorphine, Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-NH(CH2) 2OH ( RX783006 ) and D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin ( pIC30 5.90, 6.32, 7.45 and 6.74 respectively). Naloxone did not affect the release of tritium when given alone but antagonised the actions of the opioids, giving a Ke value of about 3 nM irrespective of the particular agonist used, which suggests an action at mu receptors. The delta opioid receptor blocker, ICI154129 , antagonised the opioids only in large concentrations (Ke 21300 nM). In slices previously incubated with [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine, electrical stimulation increased overflow of tritium but neither naloxone nor the opioid agonists affected evoked overflow of tritium at concentrations which were effective in slices incubated with [3H]noradrenaline. It is concluded that stimulation of mu opioid receptors may inhibit release of noradrenaline from central noradrenergic neurones and that these receptors are not present in significant numbers on neurones releasing 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cortex.", 
    "49": "(-)-Noradrenaline-mediated pressor responses in the rat mesenteric artery preparation are blocked by alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists, BE2254 and prazosin with pA2 values of 8.59 and 8.52 respectively. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor selective antagonist rauwolscine, does not influence responses to (-)-noradrenaline in concentrations up to 10 microM. This rank order is consistent with an alpha 1-adrenoceptor mediated effect. Shifts in the (-)-noradrenaline dose-response curve produced by BE2254 and prazosin were parallel and there was no significant effect on the observed maximal response. Slope values from Schild plots were not significantly different from unity indicating that these antagonists were behaving as classical competitive antagonists.", 
    "50": "There has been a dramatic increase in the number of women breast-feeding during the last decade. Since little is known about the excretion of antihypertensive drugs into human breast milk, the management of hypertension during lactation can be problematical. To enable the clinician to better advise the hypertensive, lactating mother, the published literature on the excretion of antihypertensive agents into human milk has been reviewed and is presented in this report.", 
    "51": "Do beta blockers prevent the elevation of blood pressure induced by physical exercise and mental stress? The variations of blood pressure and pulse rate observed with dynamic effort and during tests of mental calculation, colour stress, and grip strength were measured in 15 hypertensive patients, before and after treatment with atenolol (100 mg day-1) and in a series of 16 normotensive control subjects. With treatment, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures and the pulse rate were significantly lowered in the hypertensive patients at rest. The tests of mental stress and static physical effort caused a rise in blood pressure, significantly greater in the untreated patients than in the control subjects. Atenolol diminished the rise in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate secondary to a dynamic effort, but did not significantly alter the blood pressure variations induced by static physical effort and mental stress. These findings are in agreement with previous results obtained with other beta blockers.", 
    "52": "Chemical and stereochemical aspects of the metabolic N-dealkylation pathway of propranolol were examined in rat, dog, and man. Metabolites arising from pseudoracemates of propranolol were analyzed by GC-MS. In the presence of the rat liver 9000g supernatant fraction, desisopropylpropranolol arose primarily from R-propranolol while subsequent metabolites of this pathway were formed preferentially from S-propranolol. Small amounts of these metabolites (less than 3% of a 20 mg/kg ip dose) were also found as urinary metabolites in the rat. The formation of the two acidic metabolites, naphthoxylactic acid (NLA) and naphthoxyacetic acid, was stereoselective from S- and from R-propranolol, respectively. The stereochemical results from NLA formation in man in vivo were similar to those in rats, being stereoselective for S-propranolol. However, in dog administered pseudoracemic propranolol by iv infusion, more R-than S-propranolol was converted to NLA. In all experiments, in vitro (rat liver 9000g supernatant fraction) and in vivo (rat, dog, and man), the naphthoxyacetic acid formed arose preferentially from R-propranolol, when compared to the stereochemical origin of NLA. In vitro metabolism of the enantiomers of NLA also yielded significantly more naphthoxyacetic acid from the S-enantiomer of NLA (stereochemically related to R-propranolol). These results are consistent with a stereoselective conversion of S-NLA to naphthoxyacetic acid, possibly via enzymes similar to L-lactate dehydrogenase.", 
    "53": "To analyse the molecular mechanism of action of beta-adrenergic compounds in reducing the intraocular pressure, the binding of 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol to bovine pigmented ciliary processes was studied. The binding was found to be highly specific, saturable, reversible and displayed stereospecificity. Only one class of binding sites was detected. Values for KD of 0.18 nM and 0.32 nM were derived from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, respectively. The total number of beta receptors was large : 1.28 pmoles/mg protein. Competitive inhibition of 125I-iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding by agonists and antagonists revealed that the majority of beta receptors in bovine pigmented ciliary processes were of the beta 2 type. The pharmacological and biochemical characteristics of the binding of adrenergic drugs found in these membranes are consistent with a regulation of aqueous humor production by the beta adrenergic system.", 
    "54": "The effects of intravenous infusions of dopamine (0.1 to 1 mg kg-1h-1) and bromocriptine (10 to 40 micrograms kg-1h-1) on colonic motility were investigated in fasted dogs fitted with permanent strain gauges on the ascending, transverse and descending colon. Infused at rates of 0.5 and 1 mg kg-1h-1 during 1 h, dopamine immediately stimulated the motility of the descending colon; after a delay of 40 to 60 min this effect was balanced by an inhibition of the motility of the ascending and transverse colon. Bromocriptine infused intravenously at doses of 10 to 40 micrograms kg-1h-1 stimulated the motility of the whole colon but these effects were limited to the duration of the infusion (60 min). Both propranolol (0.5 mg kg-1) and tolazoline (2 mg kg-1) failed to block the effects of dopamine and bromocriptine whereas phentolamine (0.1 mg kg-1) and prazosin (0.2 mg kg-1) partially reduced the inhibitory effects of dopamine on the proximal colon. Haloperidol at doses higher than 0.2 mg kg-1 and domperidone blocked the bromocriptine-induced stimulation of colonic motility which was unaffected by previous treatment with alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents. These results suggest that in the dog, dopamine and bromocriptine stimulate colonic motility through specific dopamine receptors. However, they suggest that the inhibitory effects of dopamine on the proximal colon which are blocked by dopamine antagonists are also partially due to an effect on alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "55": "The pharmacokinetics of medroxalol are described in normal subjects and compared with those of labetalol. Both drugs were administered in doses of 400 mg orally and 1 mg/kg intravenously. The data for both drugs was most appropriately described by a two compartment model. For oral medroxalol the clinical pharmacokinetic parameters were a terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2,Z) of 15.6 h, a peak level of 450 ng/ml and a time to peak of 2-3 h. Following intravenous medroxalol the bioavailability was calculated as 64%, the plasma clearance was 948 ml/min and the t 1/2,Z was 7.3 h. The t 1/2,Z following intravenous administration was significantly shorter than that following oral administration. The significant differences between medroxalol and labetalol were in time to peak, respectively 2.3 and 1.1 h; oral t 1/2,Z, 15.6 and 5.5 h; clearance 948 and 1560 ml/min; and bioavailability, 64 and 20%. Despite the pharmacokinetic differences a similar plasma concentration-hypotensive effect relationship was described for each drug.", 
    "56": "Medroxalol, a new drug which has been reported to possess both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist properties, was compared with labetalol in single dose studies in normotensive males. Oral doses of 400 mg of each drug significantly reduced blood pressure, both supine and erect, without significant changes in heart rate. The chronotropic and diastolic depressor responses to isoprenaline were significantly antagonised by both drugs, for at least 6-8 h after drug administration. Medroxalol was associated with significantly greater beta-adrenoceptor antagonism than labetalol. There was no significant antagonism by either drug of the pressor response to noradrenaline. However, in a sub-group of subjects the responses to the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, were consistent with modest alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism. This was significant only for labetalol. The ratios of beta 1- to alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonism as calculated from the relative shifts of the isoprenaline and phenylephrine dose-response curves, were 3 to 1 for labetalol and about 7 to 1 for medroxalol.", 
    "57": "Pharmacological treatment of hypertension can cause clinically significant alterations in endocrine function through effects on glucose homeostasis, thyroid and parathyroid hormones, adrenal steroid metabolism and reproductive/pituitary physiology. Long term use of thiazide diuretics causes deterioration in glucose tolerance, probably secondary to potassium depletion. Hypoglycaemic complications of beta-blockers (mainly the non-selective compounds) can be dramatic, especially in type I diabetics. Clonidine, diazoxide and calcium antagonists have all been associated with deterioration in glucose tolerance and their long term use should be avoided in type II diabetics if possible. Propranolol lowers T3 levels by decreasing the conversion of T4 to T3. Prazosin causes elevations in T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone, while sodium nitroprusside use may result in hypothyroidism. Numerous agents are associated with sexual dysfunction, including methyldopa, reserpine, clonidine and spironolactone. Thiazide diuretics may cause hypercalcaemia, particularly in patients with hyperparathyroidism, by decreasing urinary calcium as well as directly influencing bone and gut calcium handling. Conversely, propranolol may decrease circulating parathyroid hormone levels and correct the hypercalcaemia seen in hyperparathyroidism. Awareness of drug-induced changes in endocrine function will facilitate the rational management of the hypertensive patient.", 
    "58": "There is an increasing use and variety of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents (beta-blockers) available for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. Recent comparative studies suggest that atenolol (200mg daily), metoprolol (200mg daily); acebutolol (400mg daily), oxprenolol ( 160mg daily), nadolol ( 80mg daily) and timolol (20mg daily) produce a beneficial clinical response equal to that seen with propranolol ( 160mg daily). Most beta-blockers reduce resting heart rate by approximately 25 to 30 beats/min, although a lesser reduction is seen with those possessing intrinsic sympathomimetic activity such as oxprenolol and pindolol. While earlier studies employing large doses of intravenous propranolol concluded that beta-blockade reduced myocardial contractility, more recent non-invasive studies suggest that the predominant cardiac effect is on heart rate. In patients with cardiac failure, beta-blockers may, however, produce a profound fall in cardiac output. Nevertheless, in combination with digoxin they may be useful in controlling the atrial fibrillation of thyrocardiac disease. beta-Blockers improve nervousness and tremor (although to a lesser extent with cardioselective agents) and severe myopathy, and they also reduce the frequency of paralysis in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. There is often subjective improvement in sweating but usually no major effect on eye signs. Recent studies show a 10% reduction in oxygen consumption/basal metabolic rate with long term oral use of selective or nonselective beta-blockers. In addition, many agents (propranolol, metoprolol, nadolol and sotalol but not acebutolol, atenolol or oxprenolol) reduce circulating tri-iodothyronine (T3) concentration by between 10 and 40%, although the clinical significance of this effect (if any) is not established. beta-Blockers may also have endocrinological effects on gastrin, cyclic AMP, catecholamines and other hormone levels. Given in adequate dosage, propranolol has been shown to control thyrotoxic hypercalcaemia. Minor side effects (nausea, headaches, tiredness, etc.) are quite common but overall beta-blockers are well tolerated by the thyrotoxic patient. The major use of these drugs is in symptomatic control while awaiting definitive diagnosis or treatment. As an adjunct to antithyroid drugs or radioactive iodine, beta-blockers will produce a satisfactory clinical response in the weeks to months before these forms of therapy produce a euthyroid state. beta-Blockers are more convenient than antithyroid drugs in the control of patients receiving therapeutic radioiodine, in that continuous therapy and assessment of biochemical response is possible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Two cases of severe beta-blocker overdose are presented that were treated successfully with glucagon therapy. The effects of glucagon in reversing the cardiovascular depression of profound beta-blockade, including its mechanism of action, onset and duration of action, dosage and administration, cost and availability, and side effects are reviewed. Medical complications of beta-blocker overdose include hypotension, bradycardia, heart failure, impaired atrioventricular conduction, bronchospasm and, occasionally, seizures. Atropine and isoproterenol have been inconsistent in reversing the bradycardia and hypotension of beta-blocker overdose. Glucagon increases heart rate and myocardial contractility, and improves atrioventricular conduction. These effects are unchanged by the presence of beta-receptor blocking drugs. This suggests that glucagon's mechanism of action may bypass the beta-adrenergic receptor site. Because it may bypass the beta-receptor site, glucagon can be considered as an alternative therapy for profound beta-blocker intoxications. The doses of glucagon required to reverse severe beta-blockade are 50 micrograms/kg iv loading dose, followed by a continuous infusion of 1-15 mg/h, titrated to patient response. Glucagon-treated patients should be monitored for side effects of nausea, vomiting, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. The high cost and limited availability of glucagon may be the only factors precluding its future clinical acceptance.", 
    "60": "Mitral valve prolapse is a very common condition. It occurs in 4-5% of the population. It may be idiopathic or associated with a number of other conditions. Myxomatous degeneration is the underlying mechanism of mitral valve prolapse. Most patients with mitral valve prolapse have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, palpitations, chest pain and dyspnea are the major complaints. The midsystolic click occasionally followed by the late systolic murmur are the typical physical findings. The echocardiogram plays a big role in the diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse. The beta blockers are used in the treatment of the symptomatic patient.", 
    "61": "Recent results obtained from large clinical trials demonstrate that long-term administration of beta-adrenergic antagonists to patients following myocardial infarction reduces the incidence of death for as long as two years. Therefore, it has been recommended that, in the absence of contraindications, all patients be given beta antagonists after infarction. A review of the literature regarding prognosis after infarction demonstrates that patients who have had only one infarction and who have good ventricular function, no complex ectopy, no angina, and negative results of stress testing have a mortality rate no greater than 0.6 percent per year. For a person in this category, the probability that beta blockade will preclude death is exceedingly low (approximately 1 in 700). Both the commonly described side effects, as well as the recent observation that beta-adrenergic antagonists lower the concentration of serum high-density lipoproteins, potentially reducing the protection against atherosclerosis thought to be conferred by high-density lipoproteins, suggest that it may be unwise to use beta antagonists in patients who have a very low probability of benefit.", 
    "62": "The calcium channel blocking drugs--nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem--are an important adjunct to treatment of typical exertional angina and are the treatment of choice for angina due to coronary artery spasm. These drugs are as effective as nitrates and beta-adrenergic blocking agents in treatment of patients with ischemic heart disease. With certain precautions, they may also be used in combination with nitrates and beta blockers. The three calcium blockers are not completely interchangeable because each has distinctive therapeutic applications and side effects. Detailed knowledge of each drug is important for its intelligent application in treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "63": "Both prenalterol and pirbuterol are partial agonists (when compared to isoproterenol) in rat left atria. Schild analysis with the beta-1 adrenoceptor selective antagonist atenolol indicated that all three agonists stimulate beta-1 adrenoceptors in this preparation. Atria from rats implanted with mini-osmotic pumps which delivered isoproterenol (400 micrograms kg-1 hr-1) s.c. for 4 days were 9 times less sensitive than control, to isoproterenol, and produced no responses to either prenalterol or pirbuterol. Schild analysis with atenolol on these desensitized atria indicated a homogeneous population of beta-1 adrenoceptors. In the desensitized atria, both prenalterol and pirbuterol functioned as competitive antagonists of responses to isoproterenol and Schild analysis yielded estimates of the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kp) of prenalterol (0.09 micron) and pirbuterol (2 micron) in these tissues. The estimates of Kp were utilized to calculate the relative efficacy of pirbuterol and prenalterol; pirbuterol was shown to have 2.3 times the efficacy of prenalterol on beta-1 adrenoceptors. The implications of this method as a means of calculating the Kp for partial agonists are discussed. These data also serve as a caveat to the use of pirbuterol in the determination of functional cardiac beta adrenoceptor subtypes in experimental animals and in man.", 
    "64": "In 62 patients with coronary artery disease who underwent aortocoronary bypass graft surgery, we measured the mean systolic ejection rate invasively at rest and during upright exercise before and several months after operation. After bypass surgery, mean systolic ejection rate did not show any change at either supine or sitting rest and at submaximal exercise levels of walking on a treadmill. At maximal exercise, only patients with complete revascularization showed a significant increase in heart rate from 105 to 147 (+40%) and mean systolic ejection rate from 339 ml/sec to 404 ml/sec (+19%, P less than 0.001). Patients with incomplete revascularization did not show a substantial change in these variables. Beta-blocker withdrawal did not affect the result significantly.", 
    "65": "Ten hypertensive patients with poor responses to standard antihypertensive therapy were treated with the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine in an attempt to obtain better BP control. The drug was highly effective in significantly lowering BP immediately (average decrease, 58/29 mm Hg) and after three to eight weeks of maintenance therapy (average decrease, 49/27 mm Hg), with no significant change in heart rate observed at either time. No adverse interactions between nifedipine and other concurrent medications, including digoxin and beta-adrenergic blockers, were noted. Drug-related side effects of tachycardia or flushing necessitated the withdrawal of nifedipine therapy in two patients. We conclude that nifedipine may be safely employed in an outpatient setting as a useful adjunct to current antihypertensive drug regimens.", 
    "66": "The clinical diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension (OH) is straightforward and usually does not require extensive laboratory testing. Symptoms of cerebral hypoxia may not occur even with low BP because of compensatory cerebral vascular autoregulation. Autonomic function tests may pinpoint the lesion in OH, but they should be selected carefully. Heart rate response to standing, the valsalva maneuver, the cold pressor test, and plasma norepinephrine levels are the most useful. General measures in management, eg, nocturnal head up tilt and use of a pressure-support garment, often will provide major relief of symptoms. The mainstay of drug therapy is fludrocortisone acetate, but edema, supine hypertension, and heart failure occur frequently. Other agents (eg, vasopressors, prostaglandin inhibitors, and beta-adrenergic blockers) may enhance effectiveness of therapy when combined with fludrocortisone acetate.", 
    "67": "We evaluated risk of heart block after cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) in patients with normal conduction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who chronically received calcium-entry blockers, beta-blockers, or combined therapy. Before CPB, calcium-entry blockers alone produced an increase in P-R intervals but no change in heart rate; calcium-entry blocker effects were undetectable after CPB, beta-Blockers alone or with calcium-entry blockers produced lower heart rates and longer P-R intervals throughout the entire perioperative period when compared to no therapy (control) or calcium-entry blockers alone. Complete heart block did not occur; one control patient had transient second degree block after CPB. First degree block appeared transiently in 5% of the patients after anesthetic induction and in 15% on emergence from CPB, but was unrelated to drug therapy. We conclude that chronic calcium-entry blocker therapy has minimal effects on conduction perioperatively; beta-blocker effects persist for up to 10 hr after CPB; and the risk of heart block with either drug or combination is low and should not be a factor in their continued administration preoperatively.", 
    "68": "Twenty-six patients with acute myocardial infarction (mean delay time 6 hours after onset of symptoms) were randomized to control or nifedipine treatment (10 mg sublingually, followed by 10 mg every 6 hours for a total of 24 hours). Nifedipine reduced arterial blood pressure from 127/78 to 115/70 mm Hg at 30 minutes (p less than 0.001) and continued to reduce the blood pressure significantly for 12 to 18 hours. Nifedipine also reduced systemic vascular resistance and the rate-pressure product. Cardiac output increased from 4.9 liters/min before nifedipine to 5.4 liters/min at 60 minutes (p less than 0.05 vs controls). In patients with high initial pulmonary wedge pressures, sublingual nifedipine decreased the wedge pressure (p less than 0.001) more effectively than did 80 mg of furosemide given intravenously. Thus, nifedipine may be useful in patients with early myocardial infarction and left ventricular failure.", 
    "69": "The results of this investigation indicate that stress produced by immobilization alters rat pineal function. Chronic stress reduced the density of pineal beta-adrenergic receptors and the activities of the intracellular enzyme serotonin N-acetyltransferase (NAT), its product N-acetylserotonin (NAS), and the pineal hormone melatonin, which was measured during the dark phase of the diurnal lighting cycle. Removal of the adrenal medulla did not prevent the reduction of pineal beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites that is observed after chronic stress. Acute immobilization stress suppressed the dark-induced elevations of pineal NAT activity and NAS levels 10 h after the stress session without altering pineal beta-adrenergic receptor binding. Although the precise mechanisms responsible for these effects are not completely clear, the results indicate that they are related to changes in sympathetic neuronal activity and not mediated by stress-induced elevations in plasma catecholamines.", 
    "70": "The effects of hyper- and hypothyroidism on sympathetic nervous system activity and energy expenditure are well recognized. The impact of altered sympathetic nervous system activity on energy expenditure and thyroid hormone metabolism has not been well studied. We investigated the effects of orally administered terbutaline sulfate, a beta 2-receptor agonist (5 mg, three times per day for 2 weeks), on the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, energy expenditure, and thyroid hormone metabolism in six normal men, aged 21-36 yr. The cardiovascular, metabolic, and thermogenic responses to an infusion of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol were clearly blunted after 2 weeks of treatment with terbutaline sulfate, indicating down-regulation of beta-receptors and/or development of reduced sensitivity. There were no significant changes in the cardiovascular, metabolic, or thermogenic responses to an infusion of the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Basal metabolic rate was significantly increased by the chronic administration of terbutaline sulfate [5.040 +/- 0.167 (+/- SE) vs. 5.421 +/- 0.234 kJ/min; P less than 0.05]. There was a highly significant change in the serum T3 to T4 ratio (19.4 +/- 1.0 vs. 24.4 +/- 1.0; P less than 0.001). This was a result of increased serum T3 concentrations (136 +/- 9 vs. 160 +/- 14 ng/dl; P less than 0.05) and decreased serum T4 concentrations (7.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 6.7 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl; P = NS). Chronic beta-receptor stimulation with terbutaline sulfate increases the basal metabolic rate and T3 concentrations. These changes occurred despite down-regulation of beta-receptors and/or decreased sensitivity in response to chronic terbutaline administration.", 
    "71": "Eleven patients with severe left ventricular impairment (mean ejection fraction 24%) and moderate impairment of exercise tolerance underwent a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial of the orally administered beta-agonist prenalterol. Exercise hemodynamics and tolerance were measured during bicycle and treadmill exercise after 2 weeks of therapy with placebo or prenalterol. Cardiac index, ejection fraction, and stroke work index were not improved and exercise duration and peak oxygen consumption were not significantly different during the two treatments. During prenalterol treatment heart rate during exercise was consistently reduced. These results show that prolonged therapy with prenalterol does not improve hemodynamics or exercise tolerance and is associated with a diminished heart rate response to exercise.", 
    "72": "In sheep with chronic fistulae of the small intestine and rumen the participation of the beta-adrenergic receptor was investigated in the enteroruminal reflex and enteroenteric reflex using the method of pharmacological analysis. The movements of the segments of the digestive tract with fistulae were recorded by the balloon method. A solution of hydrochloric acid administered into the ileum caused a reflex stimulation of its motor activity and inhibited the movements of the rumen. Intravenous administration of propranolol before instillation of the acid into the intestine abolished or reduced greatly the reflex inhibition of the movements of the rumen and in the small intestine it enhanced significantly the studied reflex reaction. Thus stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor plays an important role in the reflex stimulation of the motor activity of the rumen, and stimulation of the motor activity of the small intestine in the enteroenteric reflex is limited by the effects derived from this receptor.", 
    "73": "Intraperitoneal injection of sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8; 10 micrograms/kg) resulted in an increase in the IC50 for isoproterenol (4.2 microM to 23.3 microM) in displacing 1 nM 3H-dihydroalprenolol binding to rat hypothalamic membranes. 3H-p-Aminoclonidine binding was also lower in membranes prepared from CCK-treated rats, but the decrease was not statistically significant. In vitro, CCK(1-100 nM) had no effect on either alpha- or beta-adrenergic binding or on the 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate modulation of binding. The results indicate that CCK does not act directly upon adrenergic receptors, but may reduce beta-adrenergic affinity through indirect means.", 
    "74": "Intracellular cAMP increased 9-fold in cerebral hemisphere primary cultures after incubation with dopamine (10(-4) M). The effect was dose- and time-dependent (10(-6) M-10(-4) M; 2-10 minutes). It was mimicked, to some extent, by the partial agonist apomorphine (10(-5) M-10(-4) M) and antagonized by fluphenazine (10(-5) M-10(-4) M). The elevation of cAMP caused by dopamine was incompletely antagonized by propanolol (10(-5) M-10(-4) M), obviating an interaction with beta-adrenergic receptors. A beta-adrenergic effect was antagonized by propranolol but only slightly by fluphenazine. The effect of dopamine on cAMP-level was more pronounced in a subpopulation of the hemisphere culture, i.e. in astroglial cultures from the striatum, 12-fold compared with controls at 10(-4) M. No dopamine stimulated formation of cAMP was found in primary cultures from brain-stem. The results demonstrated some heterogeneity among astroglial cells. The cultures used contained mainly astroglial-like cells, as judged from immunohistochemical localization of the glial specific proteins S 100 and GFA (alpha-albumin). No mature neurons or oligodendroglial cells have so far been demonstrated in the cultures.", 
    "75": "The authors studied the number of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors and the cyclic nucleotide concentration in both male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) at 4 to 5, 10 to 15, 20 to 25 and 35 to 55 weeks of age. A potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, (125I) iodohydroxybenzylpindolol was used to estimate the number and affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors. beta-adrenergic receptors in cardiac membranes from SHR of 4 to 5 weeks and 10 to 15 weeks numbered 63.1 +/- 4.6 and 51.6 +/- 4.6 f mol/mg protein, respectively. These were significantly (p less than 0.02) greater than the number in WKY at 4 to 5 weeks and 10 to 15 weeks (42.2 +/- 5.1 and 31.5 +/- 5.4 f mol/mg protein, respectively). The dissociation constant in the membranes was the same in WKY and SHR, and no significant differences were found in the number of receptors and affinity of SHR and WKY at 20 to 25 weeks or 35 to 55 weeks of age. Also, there was no difference in the concentration of myocardial cyclic nucleotides at the various ages. Since cardiac hypertrophy in SHR had appeared before the onset of hypertension at about 7 weeks, the present results suggest that the SHR heart is hypersensitive to catecholamines and hemodynamically hyperkinetic due to the increased numbers of beta-receptors in the pre- and early stages of hypertension.", 
    "76": "The possibility that catecholamine secretion from the rabbit adrenal gland is subject to modulation by a mechanism involving beta-adrenoceptors was investigated in an isolated perfused preparation of the gland. The adrenal catecholamine stores were radiolabelled with 3H-adrenaline and subsequently efflux of radioactivity was elicited by stimulation of an attached branch of the splanchnic nerve. The efflux of radioactivity evoked by nerve stimulation (1 min at 5 Hz) was not altered by isoprenaline (0.1 microM), metroprolol (0.1 microM) or (+/-)-propranolol (1 microM). Stimulation-induced efflux was reduced in the presence of a higher concentration of (+/-)-propranolol (10 microM); however, it was also reduced by (+)-propranolol (10 microM). These findings do not support the existence in the rabbit adrenal gland of a mechanism involving beta-adrenoceptors through which catecholamine secretion may be modulated.", 
    "77": "Muscarinic receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor binding were measured simultaneously in a membrane fraction of bovine tracheal smooth muscle using [3H]-L-quinuclidinyl benzilate and [125I]-(-) iodocyanopindolol. The binding characteristics, affinity and receptor density, obtained in the double receptor assay and in the control experiments were the same within experimental error. Moreover, there appears to be neither a significant influence of an excess of d,1-propranolol on [3H]-L-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding nor a significant influence of an excess of 1-quinuclidinyl benzilate on [125I]-(-)iodocyanopindolol binding. The method is advantageous where both receptors have to be assayed and where limited amounts of biological material, like in biopsy specimen, are available.", 
    "78": "The antihypertensive action of prazosin and propranolol, as well their effect on serum lipid levels, were evaluated in a crossover study in 20 men with untreated mild to moderate hypertension in a general practice environment. Both prazosin (7.5 +/- 0.5 mg/day) and propranolol (270 +/- 26 mg/day) produced a similar reduction in blood pressure over an eight-week period. The administration of propranolol also led to a reduction of the mean fasting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration by 10.5% (P less than 0.01) and this effect was dose-related (r = -0.414; P less than 0.05). Prazosin treatment produced no changes either in the total or in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but led to a reduction of the total triglyceride levels by 9.5% (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that the value of blood pressure reduction produced by high doses of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, such as propranolol, may be diminished by a potentially adverse effect of these agents on serum lipid levels. Conversely, alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents may confer an added benefit in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "79": "Intracellular free calcium has been implicated in vascular smooth-muscle contraction and in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension. We studied free-calcium levels in blood platelets, which have many features in common with vascular smooth-muscle cells. With use of an intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye, the free-calcium concentration in platelets was found to be elevated in 9 patients with borderline hypertension and 45 patients with established essential hypertension, who were compared with 38 normotensive subjects. There was a close correlation between the free-calcium level and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (n = 92; r = 0.883 for systolic pressure and 0.931 for diastolic pressure; P less than 0.001 for both). Antihypertensive treatment with calcium-entry blockers (n = 15), beta-adrenoceptor blockers (n = 12), or a diuretic (n = 6) resulted in a reduction in free calcium, and this correlated with the fall in blood pressure (P less than 0.001). The intracellular free-calcium concentration in platelets may be determined by the same humoral or pharmacologic factors that determine the height of blood pressure.", 
    "80": "Gradually altered synthetic entities were employed as molecular probes, and arachidonic acid, ADP, human alpha-thrombin and the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 as aggregation-inducing agents, in a comprehensive study on the response profile of human blood platelets with an emphasis on the effects of exogenous and increased intracellular Ca2+. Corroborating further previous conclusions, some representative carbamoylpiperidine derivatives, at concentrations effecting substantial inhibition of ADP-induced aggregation, failed to retain that effect when 5.0 mM Ca2+ was introduced into the otherwise identical test medium; reference compounds chlorpromazine and propranolol registered corresponding inhibitory patterns. At increased concentrations the compounds' inhibitory potency was regenerated even in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+. In fact, in sufficiently high concentrations, the compounds were even capable of inhibiting aggregation elicited by 15 microM of the ionophore A23187; so did chlorpromazine and propranolol. Another set of congeners revealed the striking sensitivity of ionophore A23187-induced human blood platelet aggregation to the surface active potencies of inhibitor molecules. The loss in inhibitory potency was directly related to the lesser hydrophobic character of the molecule.", 
    "81": "The existence of beta-adrenergic receptors was demonstrated on whole A431 cells as well as A431 membrane preparations by means of binding assays using the hydrophobic 1-[3H]dihydroalprenolol and the hydrophilic antagonist [3H]CGP-12,177 as beta-adrenergic ligands. Binding was stereospecific. The receptors, as shown by competition studies, proved to be of the beta 2-subtype and appeared functional in the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The number of receptors per cell and the yield of receptor sites/mg membrane protein render the A431 cell a useful tool for the study of human beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "82": "The lack of paradoxical sleep (PS) observed in rats after pharmacological blockade of the noradrenergic beta-receptors was reversed by intraventricular infusion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from PS-deprived donor rats. The PS restoration in recipient animals was proportional to the duration of the deprivation in donors. It is concluded that some PS-inducing factor progressively accumulates in the CSF during deprivation. This factor acts beyond the noradrenergic step in the regulation of PS.", 
    "83": "In rats receiving (-)-deprenyl (1 mumol/kg, s.c.) twice daily for 3 weeks, the Bmax of imipramine binding sites located in crude synaptic membranes prepared from frontal cortex increases while the NE stimulation of cAMP accumulation in minces prepared from frontal cortex is attenuated. The presence of intact 5HT axon terminals is an absolute requirement for the down-regulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor function by repeated injections of (-)-deprenyl. These and other lines of evidence suggest that the increase in the Bmax of [3H]imipramine binding sites and the attenuation of beta-adrenergic receptor function elicited by (-)-deprenyl might be causally related.", 
    "84": "The effects of IgG purified from BALB/c anti CF1 sera on the spontaneous contractions of isolated oviductal tract from CF1 mice were explored. Cumulative dose-response curves were constructed for the effect of immune IgG on nice oviductal tracts from proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus, comparing them with those obtained with norepinephrine. Both the adrenergic agonist and the immune IgG produced a sustained inhibition of spontaneous motility during the whole sex cycle. Normal IgG was virtually devoid of activity. The sensitivity of CF1 mouse oviducts to the inhibitory actions of immune IgG and norepinephrine varied depending on the hormonal stage, i.e. it was higher in natural diestrus than in metestrus; it became smaller in proestrus and was minimal during estrus. The mechanism triggered involved a beta-adrenergic reaction that could be blocked by 10(-7) M (-)-propranolol and 10(-6) M butoxamine and potentiated by chemical sympathectomy of the mice with 6-hydroxydopamine. It is concluded that: (a) alloimmune antibody reacts with isolated oviductal tract of mice inducing functional changes; (b) this action could be associated with an activation of postsynaptic beta-adrenergic sites of the plasma membrane and (c) the different effectiveness of the immune IgG observed during the sex cycle appears to depend on the affinity of beta-adrenoreceptors to react with it.", 
    "85": "A case of juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in a 30-year-old male patient is reported. He was admitted to the hospital because of severe diabetic neuropathy, predominantly in the lower extremities. Signs of autonomic neuropathy were not evident but the patient had severe orthostatic hypotension. Circulating catecholamine concentrations were normal; however, the blood pressure response to infused norepinephrine was reduced ten-fold compared to a group of normals. An improvement of the blood pressure response to sympathomimetic drugs was accomplished during the simultaneous administration of propranolol, a beta-receptor blocking agent. The present data suggest a possible defect of the adrenergic receptor system in response to sympathomimetic drugs while the release of catecholamines and the function of the parasympathetic nervous system appears to be intact. Treatment with beta-blocking agents such as propranolol as an adjunct to sympathomimetics seems to be a promising approach which might deserve further consideration in similar cases."
