In addition, the efficacy of behavioural programmes for managing dental fears is well established. While often these two approaches are seen as oppositional, our work in Seattle, Morgantown and at King's College London Dental Institute demonstrates the complementarity of the two approaches. Using the example of two compounds, one very familiar, propranolol, and one that has recently become of interest, D-cycloserine, we wish to illustrate the manner in which these medications can be used to enhance behavioural approaches to managing dental anxiety.",

However, ANG II inhibits chloride transport in the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL). Because ANG II and catecholamines are both stimulated by a decrease in extracellular fluid volume, the purpose of this study was to examine whether there was an interaction between ANG II and catecholamines to mitigate the inhibition in chloride transport by ANG II. In isolated perfused rat mTAL, 10(-8) M bath ANG II inhibited transport (from a basal transport rate of 165.6 +/- 58.8 to 58.8 +/- 29.4 pmol.mm(-1).min(-1); P < 0.01). Bath norepinephrine stimulated chloride transport (from a basal transport rate of 298.1 +/- 31.7 to 425.2 +/- 45.8 pmol.mm(-1).min(-1); P < 0.05) and completely prevented the inhibition in chloride transport by ANG II. The stimulation of chloride transport by norepinephrine was mediated entirely by its beta-adrenergic effect; however, both the beta- and alpha-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol and phenylephrine prevent the ANG II-mediated inhibition in chloride transport. In the presence of 10(-5) M propranolol, the effect of norepinephrine to prevent the inhibition of chloride transport by ANG II was still present. These data are consistent with an interaction of both alpha- and beta-catecholamines and ANG II on net chloride transport in the mTAL.",

The administration of glucose resulted in hyperglycemia and prevented the mobilization of hepatocytic glycogen. It also prevented the development of autophagic vacuoles in general and inhibited the glycogen-degrading activity of acid \u03b1-1,4-glucosidase. The nonphosphorylated and not further metabolized glucose analog 3MG also produced hyperglycemia, but increased acid glucosidase. Pretreating the newborns with the \u03b2-adrenergic blocker propranolol inhibited the effects of 3MG. The phosphorylated but not fully metabolized glucose analog 2DG produced similar effects. The administration of xylitol to the newborns already treated with 2DG, suppressed acid glucosidase.

Preoperative identification of these conditions could lead to preventive measures in patients with HNSCC that undergo extensive surgery. Preventing morbidity and mortality is of medical and economical importance.", 
    "28": "All comorbidity of 135 consecutive patients with HNSCC that underwent extensive oncologic and reconstructive surgery as the first form of treatment between 2001 and 2007 was investigated. Based on these data, a Lee Cardiac Risk Index (LCRI) Score and an overall Adult Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE-27) severity score were calculated. The predictive value of these scores and the American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) classification toward major cardiovascular complication development were investigated. Major cardiovascular complications were defined as: cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. The impact of these complications on duration of hospitalization, medical costs, and short-term mortality (defined as death within 6 months after primary tumor diagnosis) were investigated as well. The cardioprotective effect of preoperatively prescribed beta blockers and statins are discussed.",

In univariate and multivariate analysis, a higher ACE-27 score was associated with an increased risk for major cardiovascular complications, as was as age >70 years (all values of p < .01). The AUC for this model was 0.84, indicating a performance similar to that of the LCRI score model. No statistically significant results were found for the ASA scores (p = .38). Preoperative beta-blocker use showed a significant cardioprotective function in univariate analysis, whereas statins did not. The mean duration of hospitalization was prolonged by 7 days in patients with a major cardiovascular complication. In economic terms, this means a cost increase of at least 3500 euros.

    "36": "We proposed a new acquisition method of coronary MDCT achieved by pacing rate resetting and/or propranolol or verapamil injection in patients with a pacemaker. Coronary MDCT was undertaken in 57 patients with a pacemaker (DDD: 51, VVI: 6) and in 2975 patients with sinus rhythm as control using Aquilion 64 (Toshiba). Pacing rate was reset to 60 beats per minute (bpm) in DDD, and spontaneous beats were suppressed by propranolol injection. Pacing rate was reset to 70 bpm in atrial fibrillation with VVI, and spontaneous beats were suppressed by verapamil injection. Coronary MDCT was undertaken using as high a beam pitch (BP) as possible. When spontaneous beats were not suppressed, we selected the optimal gantry speed and BP to get the highest temporal resolution. Image quality makes no significant difference between pacemaker and sinus rhythm. When spontaneous beats were completely suppressed (all pacing), mean radiation dose and acquisition time, respectively, decreased by 33.0% and 35.2% in DDD compared with the method recommended by Heart Navi (by Toshiba), and they decreased by 38.1% and 25.9%, respectively, in VVI compared with the method recommended by Heart Navi. We could not estimate coronary stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery by lead artifacts in 30% of DDD pacemakers. In conclusion, the new method is useful for not only reducing radiation dose and acquisition time, but also for maintaining image quality in patients with a pacemaker.",

A single blood sample was collected from 15 nursing infants (3-4 months of age) of the mothers participating in the study.

Over this time, maternal atenolol pharmacokinetics did not change to a clinically significant extent. Atenolol concentrations were below assay quantification limits (<10 ng/mL) in the plasma of all 3- to 4-month-old nursing infants studied. These findings support the careful use of atenolol during breastfeeding, because in the vast majority of healthy, term infants, atenolol concentrations will be too low to be clinically relevant. Premature infants and those with kidney disease require further study. Infant exposure depends on maternal dose and decreases during the first 6 to 8 months postpartum.", 
    "38": "The study was designed for spectral analysis of cardiac rhythm variability (CRV) in practically healthy subjects and patients with AH. Classification of oscillatory cardiac rhythm activity is proposed based on CRV characteristics in four frequency ranges, viz. ultralow frequency (ULF), very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF). Three types of CRV are distinguished (low, medium, and high-amplitude). Differential hypotensive therapy is recommended depending on the initial CRV level. Patients with AH and markedly narrowed CRV spectrum should be treated with beta-adrenoblockers, those with moderate and elevated CRV with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists respectively. Modern computer technologies for the analysis of slow-wave events in blood circulation may be used to evaluate regulatory process and thereby to facilitate the choice of adequate therapy.",

Although masking of metaboreflex-mediated increases in cardiac SNA by parasympathetic reactivation during PEI has been suggested, this has not been directly tested in humans. In nine male subjects (23 +/- 5 years) the muscle metaboreflex was activated by PEI following moderate (PEI-M) and high (PEI-H) intensity isometric handgrip performed at 25% and 40% maximum voluntary contraction, under control (no drug), parasympathetic blockade (glycopyrrolate) and beta-adrenergic blockade (metoprolol or propranalol) conditions, while beat-to-beat HR and BP were continuously measured. During control PEI-M, HR was slightly elevated from rest (+3 +/- 2 beats min(-1)); however, this HR elevation was abolished with beta-adrenergic blockade (P < 0.05 vs. control) but augmented with parasympathetic blockade (+8 +/- 2 beats min(-1), P < 0.05 vs. control and beta-adrenergic blockade). The HR elevation during control PEI-H (+9 +/- 3 beats min(-1)) was greater than with PEI-M (P < 0.05), and was also attenuated with beta-adrenergic blockade (+4 +/- 2 beats min(-1), P < 0.05 vs. control), but was unchanged with parasympathetic blockade (+9 +/- 2 beats min(-1), P > 0.05 vs. control). BP was similarly increased from rest during PEI-M and further elevated during PEI-H (P < 0.05) in all conditions. Collectively, these findings suggest that the muscle metaboreflex increases cardiac SNA during PEI in humans; however, it requires a robust muscle metaboreflex activation to offset the influence of cardiac parasympathetic reactivation on heart rate.",

Functional status was not improved in group II after long-term follow-up.", 
    "57": "Nonambulatory patients suffer from extensive comorbid conditions. They are accompanied with an increased occurrence of AEs, unplanned reinterventions, and poor long-term survival rates. Successful LEAR did not improve their functional status after 6 years. This emphasizes that attempts for limb salvage must be carefully considered in these patients.", 
    "58": "Nebivolol, a beta blocker with 3-10 times more beta1 cardioselectivity than metoprolol, has caused hypotension and bradycardia in overdose. We report a nebivolol-induced cardiac arrest in the setting of a polydrug ingestion, successfully resuscitated with intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) and high-dose insulin (HDI).", 
    "59": "A 48-year-old man was brought to the emergency department after ingesting nebivolol and ethanol, along with possibly diazepam and cocaine. He had a heart rate of 71/min and a blood pressure of 98/61 mmHg. The initial ECG showed sinus rhythm with a QTc of 483 ms and a QRS of 112 ms. Over the subsequent 4 h, he became bradycardic and hypotensive and developed bradyasystolic cardiac arrest. Standard resuscitation including epinephrine had no effect. Spontaneous circulation returned 30 s after a 100 mL bolus of 20% IFE, and the patient then became briefly hypertensive and tachycardic with heart rate and blood pressure measured as high as 123/min and 251/162 mmHg, respectively. His care included IFE infusion along with HDI bolus and infusion with doses as high as 21.8 units/kg/h. With subsequent hypotension, vasopressors were withheld in favor of HDI and supportive care. He was discharged with baseline neurologic function.", 
    "60": "We hypothesize that after the administration of IFE the epinephrine was able to exert its effect on receptors previously occupied with the nebivolol. This would be congruent with the lipid sink theory of IFE mechanism.",

It considers whether DHF is an independent phenotype or nothing more than a step in the development of systolic heart failure. The results of a number of studies evaluating the efficiency of treatment for DHF with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, spironolactone, and beta-blockers are given. It is concluded that diastolic dysfunction should be necessarily kept in mind on examining patients with CHF.",

    "64": "The study included 67 patients with stable Functional Classes (FC) II and II CHF who received the standard therapy and BAB non-included into the guidelines for the management of CHF. The patients were randomized to the groups taking bisoprolol (n = 35) or nebivolol (n = 32) in doses of 1.25 to 10 mg/day. Before and 6 months after therapy, the investigators assessed the patient's clinical status and quality of life (QL), performed a six-minute walk test and echography, and determined the blood level of the N-terminal fragment of brain natriuretic peptide prohormone (NT-proBNP).", 
    "65": "The switching to bisoprolol and nebivolol was followed by a significant clinical improvement, a larger covered distance, and better QL. Left ventricular ejection fraction was increased along with a reduction in mean FC CHF. There were no significant changes in NT-proBNP in the total patient group, but it was significantly decreased in the subgroup of those with the baseline high level of the peptide.", 
    "66": "The switching of patients with stable CHF from therapy with BAB not included into the guidelines for the management of CHF to nebivolol or bisoprolol yields positive results and improves left ventricular systolic function (which is attended by the reduction in NT-proBNP levels) and may be recommended for treatment in the outpatient setting.", 
    "67": "The role played by adrenergic system in water intake, especially food intake, has long been known in mammals. In avian species, there have been many experiments exploring the effects of the adrenergic system in different sites in the central nervous system in meat- and egg-type poultry. This study was designed to examine the possible effects of intralateral hypothalamic area (ILHy) microinjections of a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, and a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, on food and water intake in 3-h food-deprived and 3-h water-deprived broiler cockerels. Our findings suggest that the beta-adrenergic system directly affects food especially water intake in broilers. Although isoproterenol significantly (P < or = 0.05) decreased food intake for the first 15 min, it reduced food intake during the experiment. Isoproterenol reduced water intake significantly (P < or = 0.05), which was abolished by pretreatment with propranolol. It is proposed that beta-adrenoceptors in LHy play a direct and indirect role in the regulation of food especially water intake in broiler cockerels.",

Their presence is derived from consumption of medicines, disposal of expired medications, release of treated and untreated urban effluents, and from the pharmaceutical industry. Their growing use has become an alarming environmental problem which potentially will become dangerous in the future. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about long-term effects in non-target organisms as well as for human health. Toxicity testing has indicated a relatively low acute toxicity to fish species, but no information is available on possible sublethal effects. This study provides data on the physiological pathways involved in the exposure of Atlantic salmon as representative test species to three pharmaceutical compounds found in ground, surface, and drinking waters based on the evaluation of the xenobiotic-induced impairment resulting in the activation and silencing of specific genes.", 
    "69": "Individuals of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr were exposed during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of three representative pharmaceutical compounds with high consumption rates: the analgesic acetaminophen (54.77+/-34.67 microg L(-1)), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine (7.85+/-0.13 microg L(-1)), and the beta-blocker atenolol (11.08+/-7.98 microg L(-1)). Five immature males were selected for transcriptome analysis in brain tissues by means of a 17k salmon cDNA microarray. For this purpose, mRNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed into cDNA which was labeled with fluorescent dyes and hybridized against a common pool to the arrays. Lists of significantly up- and down-regulated candidate genes were submitted to KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) in order to analyze for induced pathways and to evaluate the usefulness of this method in cases of not completely annotated test organisms.", 
    "70": "Exposure during 5 days to environmentally relevant concentrations of the selected pharmaceutical compounds acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol produced differences in the expression of 659, 700, and 480 candidate genes, respectively. KEGG annotation numbers (KO annotations) were obtained for between 26.57% and 33.33% of these differently expressed genes per treatment in comparison to non-exposure conditions. Pathways that showed to be induced did not always follow previously reported targets or metabolic routes for the employed treatments; however, several other pathways have been found (four or more features) to be significantly induced.", 
    "71": "Energy-related pathways have been altered under exposure in all the selected treatments, indicating a possible energy budget leakage due to additional processes resulting from the exposure to environmental contaminants. Observed induction of pathways may indicate additional processes involved in the mode of action of the selected pharmaceuticals which may not have been detected with conventional methods like quantitative PCR in which only suspected features are analyzed punctually for effects. The employment of novel high-throughput screening techniques in combination with global pathway analysis methods, even if the organism is not completely annotated, allows the examination of a much broader range of candidates for potential effects of exposure at the gene level.", 
    "72": "The continuously growing number of annotations of representative species relevant for environmental quality testing is facilitating pathway analysis processes for not completely annotated organisms. KEGG has shown to be a useful tool for the analysis of induced pathways from data generated by microarray techniques with the selected pharmaceutical contaminants acetaminophen, carbamazepine, and atenolol, but further studies have to be carried out in order to determine if a similar expression pattern in terms of fold change quantity and pathways is observed after long-term exposure. Together with the information obtained in this study, it will then be possible to evaluate the potential risk that the continuous release of these compounds may have on the environment and ecosystem functioning.", 
    "73": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of landiolol on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, using transthoracic echocardiography, during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Fourteen patients undergoing ECT were studied. Bilateral ECT was performed after administration of thiopentone (2 mg/kg), succinylcholine (1 mg/kg), and initiation of assisted mask ventilation with 100% oxygen. Patients received a bolus injection of landiolol (0.125 mg/kg) or saline immediately after anesthetic induction and prior to electrical shock. LV systolic function was examined by transthoracic echocardiography prior to anesthetic induction, throughout the ECT procedure, and for 10 min after the seizure. Electrical shock resulted in a significant decrease in fractional area change (FAC) when compared with the awake condition in the control group [FAC when awake: 48 +/- 3%; 1 min after ECT: 38 +/- 4%*; 2 min after ECT: 36 +/- 4%*; 3 min after ECT: 40 +/- 3%*; mean +/- standard deviation, *p < 0.05 compared with awake]. Landiolol infusion stabilized systemic hemodynamics and LV systolic function. The study demonstrated that landiolol is a suitable agent to minimize hemodynamic changes and transthoracic echocardiographic variability after ECT.", 
    "74": "High-performance affinity chromatography was used to study binding by the drug lidocaine to human serum albumin (HSA) and alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP). AGP had strong binding to lidocaine, with an association equilibrium constant (K(a)) of 1.1-1.7 x 10(5) M(-1) at 37 degrees C and pH 7.4. Lidocaine had weak to moderate binding to HSA, with a K(a) in the range of 10(3) to 10(4) M(-1). Competitive experiments with site selective probes showed that lidocaine was interacting with Sudlow site II of HSA and the propranolol site of AGP. These results agree with previous observations in the literature and provide a better quantitative understanding of how lidocaine binds to these serum proteins and is transported in the circulation. This study also demonstrates how HPAC can be used to examine the binding of a drug with multiple serum proteins and provide detailed information on the interaction sites and equilibrium constants that are involved in such processes.",

A logistic analysis revealed that male, middle age (40 - 59 years of age) and IVS3+2996(TTA)8 of SCN1B were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the development of BrS-like ECG pattern with odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 5.9 (1.8 - 19.6), 2.9 (1.4 - 6.1) and 2.3 (1.1 - 4.9), respectively. While the IVS3+2996(TTA)8 allele has not been reported in Caucasians previously, its allelic frequency in the patients exhibiting the BrS-like ECG pattern (0.250) was comparable to that in the healthy controls (0.260).",

The remaining 5 cases died of other causes were excluded from the final analysis. Clinical data (medical history, blood pressure, clinical manifestation, NYHA cardiac function class, left ventricular diameter of diastole, left ventricular ejection fraction, ventricular arrhythmias, drug therapy) of group A and B were analyzed.",

In group A, the NYHA functional class was mostly II or III grade, and LVEF value was significantly higher than that of group B. The incidence of angina pectoris was significantly higher in group A compared to group B. beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use was also significantly higher in group A than in group B, however, the treatment dose was significantly lower and therapy duration was significantly shorter in group A than in group B. There were significantly less patients received statins and anti-platelet aggregation drugs in group A compared to group B.",

Cells with beta-adrenoceptors predominated at arterial branches. Endothelial cells expressed beta-adrenoceptors, alpha-adrenoceptors and cannabinoid-like receptors. Only endothelial alpha-adrenoceptors appeared in clusters. Adventitia was a rich source of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), particularly fibroblasts and nerve tracts, where Schwann cells bound alpha-adrenoceptor, beta-adrenoceptor and CB-receptor ligands, with a mix of separate receptor locations and co-localization.",

LPS-induced over-expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in normal human myometrium was paralleled by an overactivity of the proteins. Both over-expression and overactivity were prevented by the beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonist SAR150640 in a concentration-dependent manner. SAR150640, by itself, did not exhibit any effect on MMP production in control tissues.",

Exacerbations of POTS during pregnancy are variable. Of our patients with exacerbations of symptoms, increases in the existing pharmacologic treatments, such as increasing beta-blocker dosage, was effective in palliation of symptoms. There were seven vaginal deliveries. Two patients delivered without neuraxial anesthesia; the other five deliveries were done using epidural anesthesia without associated complications.

All four drugs form 1 : 1 host-guest complexes with CB[7], but the exchange kinetics and location of the binding is different for each drug. Atenolol is bound over the central phenyl ring with a binding constant of 4.2 x 10(4) M(-1), whereas glibenclamide is bound over the terminal cyclohexyl group with a binding constant of 1.7 x 10(5) M(-1), and memantine is totally bound within the CB[7] cavity. Paracetamol is bound in two locations, over the central phenyl ring and over the methyl group, with the CB[7] molecule shuttling quickly between the two sites.

There was less use of beta-blockers and aspirin in diabetics as compared to non-diabetics (62 vs. 71% and 95.5 vs. 97.9%, p < 0.03, for beta-blockers and aspirin, respectively). Left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock occurred more often in diabetics compared to non-diabetics (16 vs. 7% and 5 vs. 3%, p < 0.001, for left ventricular failure and shock, respectively).

Use of beta-blockers is controversial in patients who use cocaine, and the safety and efficacy of these medications in ACS in patients actively using cocaine is unknown. We enrolled 90 patients with ACS and positive urine drug screen for cocaine. Patients received standard ACS therapy plus either labetalol (n = 60) or diltiazem (n = 30). Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at baseline and 48 hours. Levels of serum CD40 ligand, interleukin (IL)-6, and choline at baseline and 48 hours were determined. There were no baseline differences in hemodynamics or serum levels of inflammatory markers between the labetalol and diltiazem groups. Both groups experienced a significant and equivalent decrease in BP and HR at 48 hours compared with baseline. At 48 hours of treatment, there were significant decreases of 17% in CD40 ligand (P < .005) and 16% in IL-6 (P < .005) but no change in choline in the diltiazem group. Furthermore, in the labetalol group, there were significant differences of 30% in CD40 ligand (P < .005 time and group comparison), 22% in IL-6 (P < .005 time and group comparison), and 18% in choline (P < .005 time and group comparison). There were no adverse events during hospitalization in any patients who received labetalol. In conclusion, labetalol appears to be safe in cocaine-associated ACS. Furthermore, labetalol provides a beneficial hemodynamic response and, in comparison to diltiazem, potentiates an anti-inflammatory vascular response in this setting.", 
    "105": "The addition of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to hydro-organic mixtures of methanol, ethanol, propanol or acetonitrile with water yielded enhanced peak shape (i.e. increased efficiencies and symmetrical peaks) for a group of basic drugs (beta-blockers) chromatographed with a Kromasil C18 column. The effect can be explained by the thin layer of surfactant associated to the hydrocarbon chain on the stationary phase in the presence of the organic solvents, which covers the free silanols on the siliceous support avoiding their interaction with the cationic basic drugs. These instead interact with the anionic head of the surfactant increasing their retention and allowing a more facile mass transfer. The peak shape behaviour with the four organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, propanol and acetonitrile) was checked in the presence and absence of SDS. The changes in peak broadening rate and symmetry inside the chromatographic column were assessed through the construction of peak half-width plots (linear relationships between the left and right half-widths at 10% peak height versus the retention time). The examination of the behaviour for a wide range of compositions indicated that the effect of acetonitrile in the presence of SDS is different from ethanol and propanol, which behave similarly. Acetonitrile seems to be superior to the alcohols in terms of peak shape, which can be interpreted by the larger reduction in the adsorbed surfactant layer on the C18 column. However, the decreased efficiencies observed at increasing surfactant concentration in the mobile phase should be explained by the reduction in retention times, more than by a change in the stationary phase nature.",

    "111": "While it is accepted that noradrenaline (NA) reduction in brain contributes to the progression of certain neurodegenerative diseases, the mechanisms through which NA exerts its protective actions are not well known. We previously reported that NA induced production of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1/CCL2) in cultured astrocytes mediated some of the neuroprotective actions of NA. We have now examined the regulation of MCP-1 production in vivo. Treatment of mice with the NA precursor l-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine induced the production of MCP-1 in astrocytes. In contrast, exposure to stress (a process known to elevate brain NA levels) produced only a moderate increase of MCP-1 because of the inhibitory activity of glucocorticoids released during the stress response. Similarly, corticosterone treatment of astrocytes caused a reduction of constitutive as well as the NA-induced MCP-1 production. When stressed rats had the production of glucocorticoids blocked by the selective inhibitor metyrapone, a large increase of MCP-1 concentration was observed in cortex, whereas propranolol (a beta adrenergic receptor blocker) avoided modifications of MCP-1 after stress. Desipramine (an inhibitor of NA reuptake) also caused an increase of MCP-1 in cortex. These data suggest that some phenomena caused by the alteration of NA or glucocorticoids could be mediated by MCP-1.", 
    "112": "Secretory vesicle swelling is required for vesicular discharge during cell secretion. The G(\u03b1o) -mediated water channel aquaporin-6 (AQP-6) involvement in synaptic vesicle (SV) swelling in neurons has previously been reported. Studies demonstrate that in the presence of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), mastoparan, an amphiphilic tetradecapeptide from wasp venom, activates G(o) protein GTPase, and stimulates SV swelling. Stimulation of G proteins is believed to occur via insertion of mastoparan into the phospholipid membrane to form a highly structured \u03b1-helix that resembles the intracellular loops of G protein-coupled adrenergic receptors. Consequently, the presence of adrenoceptors and the presence of an endogenous \u03b2-adrenergic agonist at the SV membrane is suggested. Immunoblot analysis of SV using \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antibody, and vesicle swelling experiments using \u03b2-adrenergic agonists and antagonists, demonstrate the presence of functional \u03b2-adrenergic receptors at the SV membrane. Since a recent study shows vH(+) -ATPase to be upstream of AQP-6 in the pathway leading from G(\u03b1o) -mediated swelling of SV, participation of an endogenous \u03b2-adrenergic agonist, in the binding and stimulation of its receptor to initiate the swelling cascade is demonstrated.",

Three-dimensional maps of the fractionation degree were made before and after autonomic blockade using the Ensite Navx system. In 2 patients, AF terminated following autonomic blockade. In the remaining 27 patients, 20,113 electrogram samples of 5 seconds duration were collected randomly throughout the left atrium (10,054 at baseline and 10,059 after autonomic blockade). The impact of autonomic blockade on fractionation was assessed by blinded investigators and related to the type of AF and AF cycle length. Globally, CFAE as a proportion of all atrial electrogram samples were reduced after autonomic blockade: 61.6 +/- 20.3% versus 57.9 +/- 23.7%, P = 0.027. This was true/significant for paroxysmal AF (47 +/- 23% vs 40 +/- 22%, P = 0.003), but not for persistent AF (65 +/- 22% vs 62 +/- 25%, respectively, P = 0.166).

This effect was compared to the effect on vascular smooth muscle. 2. Caudal artery preparations from Wistar rats were electrically stimulated (1 Hz, 0.5-ms duration) and noradrenaline release in the artery was detected using an high-pressure liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection technique. The pharmacological properties of the prejunctional effect of nicorandil were determined using the nonselective K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide, the pancreatic beta-cell and brain-type K(ATP) channel blocker tolbutamide, and the smooth muscle-type K(ATP) channel blocker PNU-37883A. 3. Nicorandil inhibited the electrical stimulation-evoked noradrenaline release in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was abolished by 1 micromol/L glibenclamide and 10 micromol/L tolbutamide, but was not affected by 10 micromol/L PNU-37883A or 0.3 micromol/L ODQ. Nicorandil did not affect the noradrenaline transporter uptake 1 in the adrenergic nerve terminals. 4. Nicorandil produced a relaxation response in a concentration-dependent manner in the caudal artery pre-contracted with 0.3 micromol/L noradrenaline. This relaxation response was significantly diminished in the presence of 1 micromol/L glibenclamide, 10 micromol/L PNU-37883A and 0.3 micromol/L ODQ but not by 10 micromol/L tolbutamide. 5. These findings suggest that nicorandil inhibits noradrenaline release via the K(ATP) channels of sympathetic nerves. These channels may be pharmacologically different from those of vascular smooth muscle.",

The ICR mice used were divided into regular diet, HFD, EBR (50 mg/kg/day EBR administered orally), and orlistat (10 mg/kg/day orlistat administered orally) groups. The molecular mechanism of the anti-obesity effect of EBR was investigated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as in HFD-fed ICR mice. In the obese mouse model, both weight gain and epididymal fat accumulation were highly suppressed by the daily oral administration of 50 mg/kg EBR for 8 weeks, whereas the overall amount of food intake was not affected. EBR treatment induced the expression in white adipocytes of lipolysis-related genes, including beta(3)-adrenergic receptor (beta(3)-AR), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), adipose triglyceride lipase, and uncoupling protein 2. Furthermore, the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, HSL, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase was induced in EBR-treated 3T3-L1 cells. The lipolytic effect of EBR involved beta(3)-AR modulation, as inferred from the inhibition by the beta(3)-AR antagonist propranolol. These results suggest that EBR may have potential as a safe and effective anti-obesity agent via the inhibition of adipocyte lipid accumulation and the stimulation of beta(3)-AR-dependent lipolysis.",

This study was a case-control investigation, nested within a computerized primary care database of 177 general practices across the United Kingdom; 8778 cases diagnosed and/or treated for glaucoma between 2000 and 2007, and 8778 glaucoma-free controls matched for age, sex, and practice. Odds ratios for treatment with oral antihypertensives (including selective beta(1) and nonselective beta-blockers) and statins in the 5 years before diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression, adjusted for a marker of socioeconomic position and number of drug types prescribed (as a measure of health service usage). RESULTS. Prevalence of oral beta-blocker use in the 5 years before diagnosis was lower in the cases (22.5%) than in the controls (23.6%), adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.94). This effect was presence with treatment with beta(1)-selective medications (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88) but not with nonselective medications (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.24). The prevalence of thiazide use was higher among the glaucoma cases than among the controls (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23). Neither statins nor other antihypertensive treatments were associated with the risk of glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS. Oral beta(1) beta-blockers may protect against development of glaucoma. The current consensus on the relative importance of beta(2) receptor blockade in treating glaucoma may have to be reviewed. Changes in prescribing oral beta-blockers for cardiovascular disorders may affect the number of those who eventually have glaucoma. There is no evidence to suggest that statins have a preventive role in glaucoma.", 
    "123": "Central regulation of cardiac output via the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system allows the organism to respond to environmental changes. Sudden onset stimuli, startle stimuli, are useful probes to study central regulatory responses to the environment. In mammals, startle stimuli induce a transient bradycardia that habituates with repeated stimulation. Repeated presentation of the stimulus results in tachycardia. In this study, we investigate the behavioral regulation of heart rate in response to sudden stimuli in the zebrafish. Larval zebrafish show a stereotyped heart rate response to mild electrical shock. Na\u00efve fish show a significant increase in interbeat interval that resolves in the 2 s following stimulation. This transient bradycardia decreases on repeated exposure to the stimulus. Following repeated stimulation, the fish become tachycardic within 1 min of stimulation. Both the transient bradycardia and following tachycardia responses are blocked with administration of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium, demonstrating that these responses are mediated centrally. The transient bradycardia is blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine, suggesting that this response is mediated by the parasympathetic system, while the following tachycardia is specifically blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, suggesting that this response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. Together, these results demonstrate that at the larval stage, zebrafish actively regulate cardiac output to changes in their environment using both the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system, a behavioral response that is markedly similar to that observed in mammals to similar sudden onset stimuli.",

Pseudolatexes are colloidal dispersions containing spherical solid or semisolid particles less than 1 microm in diameter and can be prepared from any existing thermoplastic water-insoluble polymer. The novel plasticized film-coating pseudolatex of zein was studied in formulation of sustained-release tablets containing very water-soluble drug. Film formation of plasticized aqueous dispersion was compared with film forming properties of plasticized organic solvent system (ethanol) of zein. The water vapor permeability (WVP), water uptake and erosion, and moisture sorption were evaluated with free films. The tablets containing metoprolol tartrate as a model drug were used in pan-coating experiments. Aqueous film coatings plasticized with PEG 400 exhibited very low water uptake. No significant difference in WVP, moisture sorption and erosion were found between aqueous films and organic solvent-based films of zein plasticized with PEG 400. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images on microstructure of films showed that colloidal particle size of zein in the aqueous films was smaller than that observed in the solvent-based films. In addition, the aqueous-based films were more compact and smoother than the respective solvent-based films. The aqueous zein-coated tablets containing very water-soluble drug (metoprolol tartrate) exhibited clear sustained-release dissolution profiles in vitro, while the respective solvent-based film-coated tablets showed much faster drug release. Furthermore, aqueous zein-coated tablets had lower water absorption at high humidity conditions. In conclusion, the plasticized aqueous dispersion (pseudolatex) of zein can be used for moisture resistant film coating of sustained-release tablets containing very water-soluble drug.",

Chromatographic separation was achieved using a mixture of a mobile phase consisting of 160 ml water, 180 ml methanol, 70 ml acetonitrile, 2.5 ml acetic acid, and 125 microl triethylamine (v/v). The pH of the whole mixture was adjusted to 3.4. A flow rate of 0.5 ml/min was employed throughout with a 15 microl injection volume. Detection was done using a UV detector at 291 nm. The validated method was linear for concentrations ranging from 15-180 ng/ ml with a good separation and specificity for both PRN and its internal standard, oxprenolol (OXP), with excellent recoveries, precision, and accuracies. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 1 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. The stability studies demonstrated that PRN is stable in the autosampler vials and also up to 3.5 months. To the authors' knowledge, the recovery, that ranged between 97.9-102.7%, is the highest among all previously reported methods that used HPLC with UV detection.

Osmotic compression induced by dextran caused an increase in passive force. Similarly, mitochondrial swelling induced by drugs that alter ionic homeostasis (alamethicin and propranolol) markedly augmented passive force (confirmed by confocal microscopy). Diazoxide, a mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener known to cause moderate mitochondrial swelling, also increased passive force (by 28 +/- 5% at 10% stretch, P < 0.01). This effect was completely blocked by 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), a putative specific inhibitor of these channels. Mitochondrial swelling induced by alamethicin and propranolol led to significant nuclear deformation, which was visualized by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, diazoxide decreased nuclear volume, calculated using three-dimensional reconstructed images, in a 5-HD-dependent manner by 12 +/- 2% (P < 0.05). This corresponds to an increase in intracellular pressure of 2.1 +/- 0.3 kPa.",

Suggested mechanisms include the effects of stress-hormones on tumor cells and on host physiology. In this study, in mice undergoing primary tumor excision, we tested the survival-enhancing potential of perioperative blockade of catecholamines and prostaglandins, and studied potential mediating mechanisms. C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intrafootpad with syngeneic B16F10.9-melanoma or Lewis lung carcinoma, and the paw was amputated when a developing tumor exceeded 100 microl. The clinically used beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, and/or the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor etodolac, were administered once before amputation, and recurrence-free survival was monitored. In different studies, NK cytotoxicity, leukocytes' molecular functional markers, and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion by tumor cells were studied in the context of surgery and drug treatments. The findings indicated that the combination of propranolol and etodolac, but neither drug alone, significantly and markedly improved survival rates in both tumor models, and was as effective as established immunostimulatory agents (IL-12 and polyinosinic-polycytiylic acid). Surgery markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity and NK cell expression of Fas ligand and CD11a, reduced all circulating lymphocyte-subtype concentrations, and increased corticosterone levels. Propranolol and etodolac administration counteracted these perturbations. B16 and 3LL secreted vascular endothelial growth factor in vitro, but secretion was not affected by catecholamine agonists, prostaglandins, corticosterone, propranolol, or etodolac. Overall, propranolol and etodolac administration, which could be applied perioperatively in most cancer patients with minimal risk and low cost, has counteracted several immunologic and endocrinologic perturbations and improved recurrence-free survival rates in mice undergoing primary tumor excision.",

    "188": "Congenital long QT syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram and increased risk of sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmias. In long QT syndrome, genes that encode for the various cardiac ion channels or regulatory proteins of these channels are mutated. The various mutations individually lead to a disruption of the normal cardiac myocyte action potential, and thus leading to a propensity for ventricular arrhythmias. Diagnosis can be difficult with patient presentations ranging from palpitations to syncope to sudden cardiac death. The QT interval can also vary over time, often requiring further testing to support the diagnosis. Recently developed genetic testing can be used to identify the responsible genes in patients with known disease. It can also be used to genotype the affected patient's family members. The current test panel only recognizes common mutations resulting in a falsely negative test for those with a rare or unidentified variant. For treatment, beta-blocker therapy is recommended for all patients, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement is recommended for those who are at high risk for a cardiac event. Future investigations will concentrate genotype-guided risk stratification for ICD placement and on genotype-specific pharmacological therapy.", 
    "189": "In neurodegenerative diseases, progressive oxidative stress is a major event that precedes neuronal death. Oxidative stress is characterized by an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. This imbalance induced oxidative molecular and cell damage, reducing cellular viability. 3-Nitropropionic acid (3NP) causes oxidative stress and other molecular and cellular changes similar to those observed in neurons of patients with Huntington's disease. Since carvedilol and melatonin act as free-radical scavengers, this study examined the effect of carvedilol (10(-5) M) and melatonin (10(-5) M) on oxidative and cell damage induced by 3NP in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells. Carvedilol and melatonin prevented the increases in lipid peroxidation and total LDH activity, as well as the depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the reduction of antioxidative enzymes activities in N1E-115 cells incubated with 100 mM 3NP. All these carvedilol and melatonin effects were more intense when the drugs were added before rather than after inducing the damage by 3NP. These results also provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that carvedilol and melatonin can be useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease.", 
    "190": "Sympathetic activation after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can induce tachycardia as well as cardiac and brain injury. We examined the effects of beta1 receptor antagonist landiolol on hemodynamics and the levels of tissue injury markers in patients with SAH. Fifty-six SAH patients undergoing intracranial aneurysm surgery with tachycardia (>or=90 beats per minute) randomly allocated to landiolol (L) or control (C) group were examined. In L group, landiolol was continuously administered during anesthesia. In C group, landiolol was not administered except bolus dose used in cases that exhibited uncontrolled tachycardia. Hemodynamics, the incidence of electrocardiographic abnormality, and levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin T, S-100beta, 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1 receptor antagonist were compared. Heart rate values from time of intubation to the end of anesthesia were significantly lower in L group than in C group, whereas blood pressure was similar between the groups. Although the incidence of bradycardia (<60 beats per minute) was significantly higher in L group than in C group (57% vs. 18%, respectively), bradycardia could be recovered without any adverse effects. The serum S-100beta levels 24 hours after operation were significantly lower in L group than in C group, whereas there were no significant differences in the incidence of electrocardiographic abnormality and levels of B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin T, 8-Hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, IL-6, and IL-1 receptor antagonist between groups.

    "191": "Timolol, a beta-blocker, has been shown to be an effective ocular hypotensive agent when used alone or with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor on ocular hypertensive or open angle glaucoma patients. The effect of timolol hemihydrate on the CO(2) hydration activities of human carbonic anhydrase (HCA) I and II and their reaction mechanisms were investigated. Timolol activates the enzyme activities of HCA I and HCA II. In HCA I and II, the enzyme kinetic results clearly showed that timolol increases the value of V(max) but does not influence the value of K(m). The enzyme kinetic method showed that timolol noncompetitively activates HCA I and II activities through the formation of a ternary complex consisting of the enzyme, the substrate, and timolol. These results indicate that timolol binds apart from the narrow cavity of the active site. AutoDocking results showed that timolol binds at the entrance of the active site cavity in a region where the proton shuttle residue, His 64, of HCA I or II, is placed. The enzyme kinetic and AutoDocking results showed that timolol might weakly bind near the proton shuttle residue, His 64, to accelerate the proton transfer rate from His 64 to the buffer components. It is known that efficient activators of carbonic anhydrase possess a bulky aromatic/heterocyclic moiety and a primary/secondary amino group in their molecular structure. Timolol has a heterocyclic moiety and a secondary amino group, which are typical structures in efficient activators of carbonic anhydrase.", 
    "192": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) remains the only cardiovascular disease with an increasing hospitalization burden and an ongoing drain on health care expenditures. The prevalence of CHF increases with advancing life span, with diastolic heart failure predominating in the elderly population. Primary prevention of coronary artery disease and risk factor management via aggressive blood pressure control are central in preventing new occurrences of left ventricular dysfunction. Optimal therapy for CHF involves identification and correction of potentially reversible precipitants, target-dose titration of medical therapy, and management of hospitalizations for decompensation. The etiological phenotype, absolute decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and a widening of QRS duration on electrocardiography, is commonly used to identify patients at increased risk of progression of heart failure and sudden death who may benefit from prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy. Patients who transition to advanced stages of disease despite optimal traditional medical and device therapy may be candidates for hemodynamically directed approaches such as a left ventricular assist device; in selected cases, listing for cardiac transplant may be warranted.",

The growth dynamics of exposed cultures were monitored using a Bioscreen instrument. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy with appropriate chemometrics and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were employed in order to investigate the phenotypic changes and possible degradation of the drugs in exposed cultures. For the majority of the bacteria studied there was not a statistically significant difference in the organism's phenotype when it was exposed to the different enantiomers or mixtures of enantiomers. In contrast, the pseudomonads appeared to respond differently to propranolol, and the two enantiomers had different effects on the cellular phenotype. This implies that there were different metabolic responses in the organisms when they were exposed to the different enantiomers. We suggest that our findings may indicate that there are widespread effects on aquatic communities in which active pharmaceutical ingredients are present.",

Both neurophysiological and cerebrospinal fluid examinations were consistent with diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and a treatment by intravenous immunoglobulin over a 5-day period was started. At the end of the treatment, the patient suffered from an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without stenosis at coronary arteriography. Left ventriculography showed segmental wall motion abnormalities with apical akinesis contrasting with hyperkinesis in basal segments, with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction at 45%. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging excluded the diagnosis of myocarditis. A diagnosis of \"transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome\" or \"Takotsubo\" syndrome was then made and a treatment by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and beta-blocker was introduced. Left ventricular dysfunction and electrocardiogram normalized within two weeks and the patient remained free from cardiovascular events at one year of follow-up. This cardiomyopathy is a recently known and now commonly diagnosed reversible systolic dysfunction mimicking ACS and is secondary to physical or emotional stress affecting mainly post-menopausal women. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities are often regressive in days or weeks, and rarely responsible for complications. This observation supports clinical evidence that electrocardiographic changes in GBS can be linked to Takotsubo syndrome, by means of the stressful trigger of GBS occurrence. This reversible cardiomyopathy needs adequate management and specific therapeutic strategies. Therefore, trans-thoracic echocardiography should be systematically performed when repolarisation abnormalities are present in this disease to rule out a Takotsubo syndrome, even in asymptomatic patients.",

Detectable effects of the used pharmaceuticals occured in the first observed generation, followed by an acclimation period and a recurrence of drug effects in later generations: daphnids exposed to MET were affected by the pharmaceutical, resulting in a decreased body length at first reproduction in the generations F0, F3 and F4 and in a reduced number of offspring in the generations F0 and F4. Similar effects were observed in daphnids exposed to EE2. DIC delayed age at first reproduction in the F0 and F2 generations and increased the body length of neonates in the generations F1 and F5. Daphnids exposed to CBZ showed a delay in the age at first reproduction for the F0 generation only. The drug mixture reduced the age at first reproduction of daphnids in the F0 and F2 generation and increased the body length at first reproduction in the generations F0 and F3.

We characterized changes in expression of a pro-inflammatory cytokine modulated by beta-AR activation in human primary and immortalized monocytes that had been simultaneously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Results from cytokine antibody arrays demonstrated that half-maximal effective concentrations of the selective beta-AR agonist isoproterenol (Iso) qualitatively increased LPS-mediated expression of the soluble cytokine, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Semi-quantitative immunoblot techniques confirmed a synergistic increase of IL-1beta production in both LPS stimulated THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes co-incubated with Iso. Immunoblot techniques as well as radioligand binding studies were also used to characterize the heterogeneous expression of beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR subtypes on THP-1 cells. beta-AR activation is classically associated with generation of cAMP in many tissues and cell types. Therefore, using the method of Schild, we generated Iso concentration-response curves in the presence of fixed subtype-selective beta-AR antagonist concentrations to demonstrate that beta(1)-AR activation was exclusively linked with the generation of cAMP in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, use of a selective kinase inhibitor demonstrated that Iso potentiated the expression of soluble IL-1beta through activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. Finally, discriminating concentrations of subtype-selective beta-AR antagonists revealed that beta(1)-AR stimulation alone accounted for the synergistic production of IL-1beta in LPS stimulated monocytes co-incubated with Iso. These results demonstrate a unique synergistic pro-inflammatory response mediated through a beta(1)-AR cAMP-dependent mechanism in LPS-challenged monocytic cells."
