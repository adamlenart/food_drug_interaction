    "0": "Autophagy recently has been shown to be involved in normal hepatic function and in pathological conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Adrenergic signalling also is an important regulator of hepatic metabolism and function. However, currently little is known about the potential role of adrenergic signaling on hepatic autophagy, and whether the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor itself may be a key regulator of autophagy. To address these issues, we investigated the actions of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist, clenbuterol on hepatic autophagy. Surprisingly, we found that clenbuterol stimulated autophagy and autophagic flux in hepatoma cells, primary hepatocytes and in vivo. Similar effects also were observed with epinephrine treatment. Interestingly, propranolol caused a late block in autophagy in the absence and presence of clenbuterol, both in cell culture and in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate that the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor is a key regulator of hepatic autophagy, and that the \u03b2-blocker propranolol can independently induce a late block in autophagy.", 
    "1": "Objective : Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial role of antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) at atherosclerotic vascular disease. Antiaggregant effect of ASA is not uniform in all patients. Purpose of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of ASA resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), pre-diabetes and non-diabetic coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "2": "Effect of ASA was assessed using the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) system. Resistance to ASA was defined as a normal collagen/epinephrine induced closure time after one week of ASA therapy. Patients with non-diabetic CAD, pre-diabetes and T2DM were compared.", 
    "3": "ASA resistance was found in 26 (37.1%), 6 (17.6%) and 41 (26.5%) patients in the groups, respectively (p=0.154). ASA resistance was found to be significantly higher in men, smokers and insulin users, besides this it was found to be significantly lower in beta blocker (BB) users, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) users with univariate analysis. However insulin usage was found to be the single effective parameter on ASA resistance in multivariate analysis.",

    "5": "An analytical method using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed to determine internal concentrations of 34 test compounds such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides in zebrafish embryos (ZFE), among them, cimetidine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, metoprolol, atropine and phenytoin. For qualification and quantification, multiple reaction monitoring mode was used. The linear range extends from 0.075 ng/mL for thiacloprid and metazachlor and 7.5 ng/mL for coniine and clofibrate to 250 ng/mL for many of the test compounds. Matrix effects were strongest for nicotine, but never exceeded \u00b120 % for any of the developmental stages of the ZFE. Method recoveries ranged from 90 to 110 % from an analysis of nine pooled ZFE. These findings together with the simple sample preparation mean this approach is suitable for the determination of internal concentrations from only nine individual ZFE in all life stages up to 96 h post-fertilization. Exemplarily, the time course of the internal concentrations of clofibric acid, metribuzin and benzocaine in ZFE was studied over 96 h, and three different patterns were distinguished, on the basis of the speed and extent of uptake and whether or not a steady state was reached. Decreasing internal concentrations may be due to metabolism in the ZFE.",

Among these, we studied STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI who were discharged alive (n = 8,510). We classified patients into the beta-blocker group (n = 6,873) and no-beta-blocker group (n = 1,637) according to the use of beta-blockers at discharge.

All-cause death occurred in 146 patients (2.1%) of the beta-blocker group versus 59 patients (3.6%) of the no-beta-blocker group (p < 0.001). After 2:1 propensity-score matching, beta-blocker therapy was associated with a lower incidence of all-cause death (2.8% vs. 4.1%, adjusted hazard ratio: 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.27 to 0.78, p = 0.004). The association with better outcome of beta-blocker therapy in terms of all-cause death was consistent across various subgroups, including patients with relatively low-risk profiles such as ejection fraction >40% or single-vessel disease.",

Clinical follow-up data were obtained for 4149 patients (99.2%). When adjusted on propensity score, \u00df-blocker use was associated with a HR for cardiovascular mortality of 0.64 (0.42-0.98) in the whole cohort (p=0.04). After one-to-one propensity score matching, both groups (n=839 in each group) were well matched on covariates. The cardiovascular mortality rate in the propensity-matched cohort was significantly lower in patients with \u00df-blocker use with a HR of 0.43 (0.22-0.82) (p=0.011). Non-cardiovascular mortality was similar in both groups. These results were consistent across different subgroups.",

    "15": "The factors with increasing diabetes-prevalence lead to significant global increases in chronic kidney disease. Since hyperglycemia generates more ROS and attenuates cellular antioxidant-defense mechanisms, numerous studies demonstrated that hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress played a major role in the extracellular matrix expansion in tissues. Although no direct relation between activation of beta-adrenergic (\u03b2-AR) system and kidney disease in diabetes and since \u03b2-blockers demonstrate marked beneficial effects due to their scavenging free radicals and/or acting as an antioxidant in diabetic animal studies, the eventual objective of the present study was to determine whether timolol-treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (5\u00a0mg/kg, daily following diabetes-induction, for 12-week) has advantage to prevent hyperglycemia-induced renal-damage via enhancing the depressed antioxidant defense in the kidney. Light microscopy data and their quantification demonstrated that timolol-treatment prevented basically glomerular hypertrophy, expansion in mesangium cell size, thickening and fibrosis in glomerular basement membrane, and accumulation of glycogen into tubular epithelial cells. Additionally, electron microscopy data demonstrated that timolol-treatment could also prevent diabetes-induced changes in the kidney tissue such as hypertrophy in podocytes, lost of filtration gaps and slit-diaphragms, and vacuolization in the distal tubular cells. Biochemical analysis basically on enzymes of antioxidant-defense system, including glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, further supported that diabetes-induced damage in the kidney is mostly dependent on the increased oxidative stress and timolol, having an antioxidant-like action, could protect the kidney against hyperglycemia-induced damage without normalization of high-blood glucose level. Consequently, it can be suggested that although \u03b2-blockers are widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, \u03b2-blocker therapy of diabetics seems to be a new therapeutic approach against hyperglycemia-induced kidney damage in diabetic patients.", 
    "16": "Precartilaginous stem cells (PSCs) are adult stem cells which could initiate chondrocytes and bone growth. In the current study, we purified PSCs from the neonate mice' perichondrial mesenchyme through immunomagnetic beads with the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR-3) antibody. Mouse PSCs were seeded and cultured, and their phenotype was confirmed by FGFR-3 over-expression. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) was added to induce PSCs differentiation. TGF-\u03b2 increased mRNA expression of chondrogenesis-related genes (collagen type II, Sox 9, and aggrecan) in the cultured PSCs, which was abolished by TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (TGFRII) lentiviral shRNA depletion. TGF-\u03b2 induced AKT activation in mouse PSCs, while the PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002) and the AKT specific inhibitors (perifosine and MK-2206) largely suppressed TGF-\u03b2-induced collagen II, Sox 9, and aggrecan mRNA expression. Meanwhile, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) blocker RAD001 or the mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor AZD-2014 also alleviated TGF-\u03b2-induced chondrogenesis-associated genes expression. Further, lentiviral shRNA depletion of SIN1 (a mTORC2 component) or mTOR inhibited TGF-\u03b2's effect in the mouse PSCs. In conclusion, our evidence suggests that TGF-\u03b2 induces the expression of chondrogenesis-related genes through TGFRII-AKT-mTOR signaling in cultured mouse PSCs.", 
    "17": "Long-chain 3-hydroxylated fatty acids (LCHFA) accumulate in long-chain 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) and mitochondrial trifunctional protein (MTP) deficiencies. Affected patients usually present severe neonatal symptoms involving cardiac and hepatic functions, although long-term neurological abnormalities are also commonly observed. Since the underlying mechanisms of brain damage are practically unknown and have not been properly investigated, we studied the effects of LCHFA on important parameters of mitochondrial homeostasis in isolated mitochondria from cerebral cortex of developing rats. 3-Hydroxytetradecanoic acid (3 HTA) reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD(P)H levels, Ca(2+) retention capacity and ATP content, besides inducing swelling, cytochrome c release and H2O2 production in Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondrial preparations. We also found that cyclosporine A plus ADP, as well as ruthenium red, a Ca(2+) uptake blocker, prevented these effects, suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and an important role for Ca(2+), respectively. 3-Hydroxydodecanoic and 3-hydroxypalmitic acids, that also accumulate in LCHAD and MTP deficiencies, similarly induced mitochondrial swelling and decreased ATP content, but to a variable degree pending on the size of their carbon chain. It is proposed that mPTP opening induced by LCHFA disrupts brain bioenergetics and may contribute at least partly to explain the neurologic dysfunction observed in patients affected by LCHAD and MTP deficiencies.", 
    "18": "The cardiopulmonary baroreflex responds to an increase in central venous pressure (CVP) by decreasing total peripheral resistance and increasing heart rate (HR) in dogs. However, the direction of ventricular contractility change is not well understood. The aim was to elucidate the cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of ventricular contractility during normal physiological conditions via a mathematical analysis. Spontaneous beat-to-beat fluctuations in maximal ventricular elastance (Emax), which is perhaps the best available index of ventricular contractility, CVP, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and HR were measured from awake dogs at rest before and after \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade. An autoregressive exogenous input model was employed to jointly identify the three causal transfer functions relating beat-to-beat fluctuations in CVP to Emax (CVP \u2192 Emax), which characterizes the cardiopulmonary baroreflex control of ventricular contractility, ABP to Emax, which characterizes the arterial baroreflex control of ventricular contractility, and HR to Emax, which characterizes the force-frequency relation. The CVP \u2192 Emax transfer function showed a static gain of 0.037 \u00b1 0.010 ml(-1) (different from zero; P < 0.05) and an overall time constant of 3.2 \u00b1 1.2 s. Hence, Emax would increase and reach steady state in \u223c16 s in response to a step increase in CVP, without any change to ABP or HR, due to the cardiopulmonary baroreflex. Following \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade, the CVP \u2192 Emax transfer function showed a static gain of 0.0007 \u00b1 0.0113 ml(-1) (different from control; P < 0.10). Hence, Emax would change little in steady state in response to a step increase in CVP. Stimulation of the cardiopulmonary baroreflex increases ventricular contractility through \u03b2-adrenergic receptor system mediation.",

    "27": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is associated with at least transient episodes of hypertension and tachycardia. Beta-blocking agents may be indicated to prevent cardiovascular complications and may shorten seizure duration. This review evaluates studies that used beta-blocking agents during ECT to determine which agent has the most favourable outcomes on cardiovascular variables and seizure duration. A Medline database search was made using the combined keywords 'adrenergic beta-antagonists' and 'electroconvulsive therapy'. The search was restricted to double-blind randomized controlled trials and yielded 29 original studies. With the use of esmolol, significant attenuating effects were found on cardiovascular parameters in the first 5 min after stimulation; its shortening effects on seizure duration may be dose-related. With the use of labetalol, findings on cardiovascular effects were inconsistent during the first minutes after stimulation but were significant after 5 min and thereafter; seizure duration was scarcely studied. Landiolol attenuates heart rate but with inconsistent findings regarding arterial pressure (AP); seizure duration was mostly unaffected. Esmolol appears to be effective in reducing the cardiovascular response, although seizure duration may be affected with higher dosages. Landiolol can be considered a suitable alternative, but effects on AP need further investigation. Labetalol has been studied to a lesser extent and may have prolonged cardiovascular effects. The included studies varied in design, methodology, and the amount of exact data provided in the publications. Further study of beta-blocking agents in ECT is clearly necessary.", 
    "28": "We proposed to determine whether, like other sexual dimorphisms, drug metabolism is permanently imprinted by perinatal hormones, resulting in its irreversible sex-dependent expression. We treated newborn male rats with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a total growth hormone (GH) blocker, and, using cultured hepatocytes, examined expression of adult CYP2C11, the predominant cytochrome-P450 expressed only in males, as well as the signal transduction pathway by which episodic GH solely regulates the isoform's expression. In addition, adolescent hypophysectomized (hypox) male rats served as controls in which GH was eliminated after the critical imprinting period. Whereas renaturalization of the masculine episodic GH profile restored normal male-like levels of CYP2C11, as well as CYP2C12, in hepatocytes from hypox rats, the cells derived from the MSG-treated rats were completely unresponsive. Moreover, GH exposure of hepatocytes from hypox rats resulted in normal induction, activation, nuclear translocation, and binding to the CYP2C11 promoter of the signal transducers mediating GH regulation of CYP2C11 expression, which dramatically contrasted with the complete unresponsiveness of the MSG-derived hepatocytes, also associated with hypermethylation of GH-response elements in the CYP2C11 promoter. Lastly, neonatal MSG treatment had no adverse effect on postnatal and adult testosterone levels. The results demonstrate that the sexually dimorphic expression of CYP2C11 is irreversibly imprinted shortly after birth by a hormone other than the customary testosterone, but likely by GH.", 
    "29": "\u03b2-blockers are widely used to treat cardiovascular diseases and in the peri-operative period in selected patients. The main benefit in terms of morbidity and/or mortality of their use is believed to be linked to specific effects on myocardial oxygen supply/demand balance, to anti-arrhythmic effects and anti-inflammatory effects. Use of \u03b2-blockers in severe sepsis is still under debate and if any, their appropriate indications remain unclear. In this article, we analyze the recent literature addressing the metabolic, immuno-modulatory and hemodynamic effects of non cardio-selective and of cardio-selective \u03b2-blockers in experimental and human sepsis in order to help clarifying the potential place of these drugs in patients with severe sepsis. From this analysis, it appears that \u03b2-adrenoceptor blocking agents may represent a therapeutic approach in patients with severe sepsis, in whom catecholaminergic hyperactivity including excessive tachycardia is supposed to play an aggravating role. However, many questions about effectiveness, safety and cardio-selectivity of the drugs and about the appropriate target population remain partially unanswered. Recently, esmolol, a short-time acting \u03b21-adrenoceptor blocker titrated to decrease heart rate below 95 beats/min was shown to exert beneficial effects in a monocentric randomized clinical trial including selected septic patients. Further large multicenter randomized trials are required to confirm the potential benefit of such a therapy in patients with severe sepsis.",

    "31": "Recently, we have developed a semidirect breath figure (sDBF) method for direct fabrication of large-area and ordered honeycomb structures on commercial polystyrene (PS) Petri dishes without the use of an external polymer solution. In this work, we showed that both the pore size and the pore uniformity of the breath figure patterns were controllable by solvent amount. The cross-sectional image shows that only one layer of pores was formed on the BF figure patterns. By combing the sDBF method and Pickering emulsion and using the modular building blocks, we endowed the honeycomb-structured Petri dish with molecular recognition capability via the decoration of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles into the honeycomb pores. The radioligand binding experiments show that the MIP nanoparticles on the resultant honeycomb structures maintained high molecular binding selectivity. The reusability study indicates that MIP-BF patterns had excellent mechanical stability during the radioligand binding process. We believe that the modular approach demonstrated in this work will open up further opportunities for honeycomb structure-based chemical sensors for drug analysis, substrates for catalysts, and scaffold for cell growth.",

HUVECs were divided into four groups, namely control group, H2O2 stimulation group, E2 intervention group and ICI182780 (ICI) intervention group. The aging-related \u03b2-galactosidase activities, cytochrome C oxidase activities, intracellular ATP levels, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and phosphorylated Rb protein expressions were mainly observed. Of which, senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activities were detected using immunohistochemical staining, cytochrome C oxidase activities and intracellular ATP levels were detected using commercial kits, ROS levels were detected by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence microplate reader, immunoblotting was used to quantitatively detect the expressions of phosphorylated Rb proteins. After continuous treatment of H2O2, the senescent phenotypes appeared in the HUVECs. The percentage of positive SA-\u03b2gal staining cells and the phosphorylated Rb expressions were significantly increased; intracellular ROS levels, cytochrome C oxidase activities and intracellular ATP levels were elevated. Compared with the H2O2 stimulation group, E2 intervention significantly decreased the positive rate of SA-\u03b2-gal staining, the phosphorylated Rb protein levels, the intracellular ROS levels, cytochrome C oxidase activities and intracellular ATP levels. Pretreatment of estrogen receptor blocker ICI182780 weakened the role of E2. These results indicated that H2O2 could induce HUVEC senescence; 17beta-E2 might relieve H2O2-induced mitochondrial damage through estrogen receptor and delay the vascular endothelial cell senescence.",

We have assessed for any corticosteroid-sparing effects of propranolol, an inverse agonist, added to low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) compared with higher dose ICS. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial in mild-to-moderate persistent asthmatic patients was performed. After a run-in (2 weeks) on hydrofluoroalkane-beclometasone dipropionate (HFA-BDP) at 100 \u03bcg/day (HFA-BDP100), patients received randomized treatments (4 weeks) with propranolol at 80 mg/day plus HFA-BDP at 100 \u03bcg/day compared with placebo plus HFA-BDP at 400 \u03bcg/day (HFA-BDP400). Propranolol was up-titrated to 80 mg/day over the initial 2 weeks. Tiotropium was co-administered until 5 days before each histamine challenge (the primary outcome). Sixteen patients completed the study [mean age, 38 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), 86.4%; histamine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PC20), 1.39 mg/ml; ICS dose, 406 \u03bcg/day]. Histamine PC20 was unchanged by adding propranolol to HFA-BDP100 compared with baseline (HFA-BDP100) {0.17 doubling dilution (dd) difference [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.58 to 0.92]}, but there was a significant improvement with HFA-BDP400 compared with both baseline [1.05 dd (95% CI: 0.43-1.66); P=0.02], and propranolol+HFA-BDP100 [0.88 dd (95% CI: 0.45-1.30); P=0.006]. Significant improvements were also observed with HFA-BDP400 for exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophils, serum eosinophilic cationic protein and asthma quality-of-life questionnaire symptoms compared with propranolol+HFA-BDP100. Salbutamol recovery post-challenge was partially blunted by propranolol (median prolongation 5 min; P=0.002).

In conclusion, the inverse agonist propranolol produced no improvements when given with low-dose ICS, whereas further significant improvements in airway hyper-responsiveness and inflammation were demonstrated with higher dose ICS. Thus, propranolol does not confer corticosteroid-sparing activity in persistent asthma.",

Therefore, our goal was to identify the risk factors for readmission of Japanese patients with heart failure (HF), particularly those with HFpEF. We analyzed 310 patients who were hospitalized for the first time with HF. Preserved EF was defined EF \u226550\u00a0%, and reduced EF (rEF) was EF <50\u00a0%. The study endpoint was readmission for HF after discharge. Medical history, vital signs, electrocardiograms, chest radiographs, blood tests and echocardiograms were compared between patients with HFpEF and with HFrEF. Among the 142 patients who had HFpEF, 43 reached the endpoint within 1\u00a0year. Multivariate analysis revealed depression (HR: 7.185), high brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels at discharge (HR: 1.003), and dilated inferior vena cava (HR: 1.100) as independent risk factors for readmission. In contrast, 39 of the 168 patients with HFrEF reached the endpoint. Risk factors for readmission of HFrEF patients were low sodium (HR: 0.856), high blood urea nitrogen (HR: 1.045), high BNP levels at discharge (HR: 1.003) and absence of beta-blocker prescription (HR: 0.395). In conclusion, our study suggests that the predictors of HF readmission differ between HFpEF and HFrEF patients.",

We hypothesized that \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blockers with antioxidant properties (nebivolol) could reverse hypertension-induced LVH more effectively than conventional \u03b21-blockers (metoprolol) when used at doses that exert similar antihypertensive effects. Two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) hypertension was induced in male Wistar rats. Six weeks after surgery, hypertensive and sham rats were treated with nebivolol (10 mg kg(-1)day(-1)) or metoprolol (20 mg kg(-1)day(-1)) for 4 weeks. Systolic blood pressure was monitored weekly by tail-cuff plethysmography. LV structural changes and fibrosis were studied in hematoxylin/eosin- and picrosirius-stained sections, respectively. Cardiac MMP levels and activity were determined by in situ zymography, gel zymography, and immunofluorescence. Dihydroethidium and lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence assays were used to assess cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Nitrotyrosine levels were determined in LV samples by immunohistochemistry and green fluorescence and were evaluated using the ImageJ software. Cardiac protein kinase B/Akt (AKT) phosphorylation state was assessed by Western blot. Both \u03b2-blockers exerted similar antihypertensive effects and attenuated hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling. Both drugs reduced myocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition in 2K1C rats. These effects were associated with lower cardiac ROS and nitrotyrosine levels and attenuation of hypertension-induced increases in cardiac MMP-2 levels and in situ gelatinolytic activity after treatment with both \u03b2-blockers. Whereas hypertension increased AKT phosphorylation, no effects were found with \u03b2-blockers. In conclusion, we found evidence that two \u03b21-blockers with different properties attenuate hypertension-induced LV hypertrophy and cardiac collagen deposition in association with significant cardiac antioxidant effects and MMP-2 downregulation, thus suggesting a critical role for \u03b21-adrenergic receptors in mediating those effects. Nebivolol is not superior to metoprolol, at least with respect to their capacity to reverse hypertension-induced LVH.", 
    "61": "Retinal neovascular pathologies, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and age-related macular degeneration, may be treated with intravitreal injections of drugs targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the main inducer of neoangiogenesis; however further improvements and alternative strategies are needed. In the last few years, an intense research activity has focused on the \u03b2-adrenergic system. The results indicate that, in different experimental models, a decrease of the \u03b2-adrenergic function may result either in reduction or in exacerbation of the vascular changes, thus suggesting possible dual effects of \u03b2-adrenoreceptor (\u03b2-AR) modulation depending on the experimental setting. In in\u00a0vivo models of proliferative retinopathies, most of the data point to a strong inhibitory role against vascular changes exerted by the blockade of specific \u03b2-ARs. In particular, the \u03b22-AR seems to be the mostly involved in these responses, and the \u03b21-/\u03b22-AR blocker propranolol results highly effective in inhibiting both the increase of VEGF expression caused by a hypoxic insult and the consequent neovascular response. These observations have prompted clinical trials in preterm infants with ROP, where oral administrations of propranolol produced positive results in terms of efficacy, although safety problems were also reported. In addition, the possibility of using topical propranolol administrations in the form of eye drops opens new potential routes of drug administration in humans. A further point that should be considered is that there are data demonstrating significant antiapoptotic effects exerted by \u03b2-ARs, therefore if \u03b2-AR blockers were used to inhibit aberrant neovascularization, there may be a burden to pay in terms of impaired neuronal viability.",

Mutations in the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes, which encode subunits of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the pancreatic beta cell, are identified in approximately 50% of these patients. The first-line drug in the treatment of HH is diazoxide. Octreotide and glucagon can be used in patients who show no response to diazoxide. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker, has been shown to be an effective treatment in a small number of patients with diazoxide-unresponsive HH. We report a HH patient with a homozygous ABCC8 mutation (p.W1339X) who underwent a near-total pancreatectomy at 2 months of age due to a lack of response to diazoxide and octreotide treatment. Severe hypoglycemic attacks continued following surgery, while the patient was being treated with octreotide. These attacks resolved when nifedipine was introduced. Whilst our patient responded well to nifedipine, the dosage could not be increased to 0.75 mg/kg/day due to development of hypotension, a reported side effect of this drug. Currently, our patient, now aged 4 years, is receiving a combination of nifedipine and octreotide treatment. He is under good control and shows no side effects. In conclusion, nifedipine treatment can be started in patients with HH who show a poor response to diazoxide and octreotide treatment.",

    "64": "Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is an electrodriven separation technique that is often used for the separation of chiral molecules. Advantages of CE are its flexibility, low cost and efficiency. On the other hand, the precision and transfer of CE methods are well-known problems of the technique. Reasons for the more complicated method transfer are the more diverse instrumental differences, such as total capillary lengths and capillary cooling systems; and the higher response variability of CE methods compared to other techniques, such as liquid chromatography (HPLC). Therefore, a larger systematic change in peak resolutions, migration times and peak areas, with a loss of separation and efficiency may be seen when a CE method is transferred to another laboratory or another type of instrument. A swift and successful method transfer is required because development and routine use of analytical methods are usually not performed in the same laboratory and/or on the same type of equipment. The aim of our study was to develop transfer rules to facilitate CE method transfers between different laboratories and instruments. In our case study, three \u03b2-blockers were chirally separated and inter-instrumental transfers were performed. The first step of our study was to optimise the precision of the chiral CE method. Next, a robustness test was performed to identify the instrumental and experimental parameters that were most influencing the considered responses. The precision- and the robustness study results were used to adapt instrumental and/or method settings to improve the transfer between different instruments. Finally, the comparison of adapted and non-adapted transfers allowed deriving some rules to facilitate CE method transfers.",

We tested a novel method for early posttrauma hyperglycemia control by suppressing hepatic glycogenolysis via \u03b22-adrenoreceptor blockade [ICI-118551 (ICI)]. We have shown that, after severe trauma, obese Zucker (OZ) rats, similar to obese patients, exhibit increased acute lung injury compared with lean Zucker (LZ) rats. We hypothesized that OZ rats exhibit a greater increase in early posttrauma glucose compared with LZ rats, with the increased posttrauma hyperglycemia suppressed by ICI treatment. Orthopedic trauma was applied to both hindlimbs in LZ and OZ rats. Fasting plasma glucose was then monitored for 6 h with or without ICI (0.2 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7h(-1) iv.) treatment. One day after trauma, plasma IL-6 levels, lung neutrophil numbers, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and wet-to-dry weight ratios were measured. Trauma induced rapid hepatic glycogenolysis, as evidenced by decreased liver glycogen levels, and this was inhibited by ICI treatment. Compared with LZ rats, OZ rats exhibited higher posttrauma glucose, IL-6, lung neutrophil infiltration, and MPO activity. Lung wet-to-dry weight ratios were increased in OZ rats but not in LZ rats. ICI treatment reduced the early hyperglycemia, lung neutrophil retention, MPO activity, and wet-to-dry weight ratio in OZ rats to levels comparable with those seen in LZ rats, with no effect on blood pressure or heart rate. These results demonstrate that \u03b22-adrenoreceptor blockade effectively reduces the early posttrauma hyperglycemia, which is associated with decreased lung injury in OZ rats.",

    "75": "The vascular endothelium not only is a single monolayer of cells between the vessel lumen and the intimal wall, but also plays an important role by controlling vascular function and structure mainly via the production of nitric oxide (NO). The so called \"cardiovascular risk factors\" are associated with endothelial dysfunction, that reduces NO bioavailability, increases oxidative stress, and promotes inflammation contributing therefore to the development of atherosclerosis. The significant role of endothelial dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis emphasizes the need for efficient therapeutic interventions. During the last years statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, antioxidants, beta-blockers and insulin sensitizers have been evaluated for their ability to restore endothelial function (Briasoulis et al., 2012). As there is not a straightforward relationship between therapeutic interventions and improvement of endothelial function but rather a complicated interrelationship between multiple cellular and sub-cellular targets, research has been focused on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the development of novel diagnostic invasive and non-invasive methods has allowed the early detection of endothelial dysfunction expanding the role of therapeutic interventions and our knowledge. In the current review we present the available data concerning the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to atherogenesis and review the methods that assess endothelial function with a view to understand the multiple targets of therapeutic interventions.

From a German population-based AMI registry, 3,544 patients (75.4% men), aged 28 to 74\u00a0years, hospitalized with an incident AMI between 2000 and 2008, surviving at least 24\u00a0hours and treated with \u03b2 blockers and antiplatelet agents at discharge were included in this study. All data were collected by standardized interviews and chart review. End point of this study was all-cause mortality at 3 follow-up periods: 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years after AMI. Mortality was assessed for all registered patients in 2010. Survival analyses and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted. Of the 3,544 patients, 83.7% received ACEI/ARB and 90.1% were treated with statins at hospital discharge. During a median follow-up period of 5.0\u00a0years (interquartile range 1.0\u00a0years), 9.3% patients died. In the multivariable Cox models adjusting for a number of covariates, use of ACEI/ARB showed a significantly inverse relation with 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality (e.g., 5-year mortality: hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.94, p\u00a0= 0.015), and the hazard ratios for mortality did not differ significantly between the 3 examined follow-up periods.

None of the adherence measures, including the HEDIS definition, significantly changed the C-statistic relative to a model that did not include adherence. However, the short-term adherence measure (having 72 d covered during the first 90 d postdischarge) showed a large change in NRI (correctly reclassifying 12% of cases and 16% of noncases; NRI: 28%; 95% CI, 22%-38%), although did not significantly differ from the change in NRI with the HEDIS measure.",

    "88": "Norepinephrine regulates latent neural stem cell activity and adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and has an important role in modulating hippocampal functions such as learning, memory and mood. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is a multi-stage process, spanning from the activation and proliferation of hippocampal stem cells, to their differentiation into neurons. However, the stage-specific effects of noradrenergic receptors in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, we used transgenic Nestin-GFP mice and neurosphere assays to show that modulation of \u03b12- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activity directly affects Nestin-GFP/GFAP-positive precursor cell population albeit in an opposing fashion. While selective stimulation of \u03b12-adrenergic receptors decreases precursor cell activation, proliferation and immature neuron number, stimulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors activates the quiescent precursor pool and enhances their proliferation in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, our data indicate no major role for \u03b11-adrenergic receptors, as we did not observe any change in either the activation and proliferation of hippocampal precursors following selective stimulation or blockade of \u03b11-adrenergic receptors. Taken together, our data suggest that under physiological as well as under conditions that lead to enhanced norepinephrine release, the balance between \u03b12- and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activity regulates precursor cell activity and hippocampal neurogenesis.",

Polymeric films were prepared by casting and drying aqueous solutions of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose and characterized in chemical-physical properties, such as drug content, thickness, morphology and water uptake capacity. In vitro transport experiments were performed in order to evaluate the permeation enhancing ability of oleic acid and polysorbate 80. All carboxymethylcellulose films showed lower cumulative amounts of drug permeated than hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Moreover, films containing both oleic acid and polysorbate 80 provided a greater permeation in comparison to film without permeation enhancers or only with one of these.

Four of 5 probands responded to \u03b2-blocker therapy, whereas 1 subject with mutation p.Q136P died suddenly during exertion despite this treatment. Mutations affect conserved residues located within Ca(2+)-binding loops III (p.N98S, p.N98I) or IV (p.D132E, p.D134H, p.Q136P) and caused reduced Ca(2+)-binding affinity.",

We investigated the cross-talk between \u03b2-AR agonist-mediated effects on \u03b22-AR function and expression and cytokine release in human bronchial epithelial cells. In 16HBE14o(-) cells grown in the presence and absence of \u03b2-AR agonists and/or antagonists, the \u03b22-AR density was assessed by radioligand binding; the receptor protein and mRNA was determined using laser scanning cytometer and RT-PCR; cAMP generation, the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 release were determined using AlphaScreen Assay and ELISA, respectively. Isoprenaline (ISO) and salbutamol (Salbu) induced a concentration- and time-dependent significant decrease in \u03b22-AR density. Both Salbu and ISO reduced cAMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner while in same cell culture the IL-6 and IL-8 release was significantly enhanced. These effects were antagonized to a greater extent by ICI 118.551 than by propranolol, but CGP 20712A had no effect. Reduction of the \u03b22-AR protein and mRNA could be seen when cells were treated with ISO for 24\u00a0h. Our findings indicate a direct link between cytokine release and altered \u03b22-AR expression and function in airway epithelial cells. \u03b22-AR desensitization and downregulation induced by long-term treatment with \u03b22-AR agonists during asthma may account for adverse reactions also due to enhanced release of pro-inflammatory mediators and should, thus, be considered in asthma therapy.",

The CVB3 inoculated mice were evenly divided into myocarditis group (n=32), carvedilol group (n=32) and metoprolol group (n=32). Twenty mice (control group) were inoculated intraperitoneally with normal saline. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and histopathologic scoring were used to investigate the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on myocardial histopathologic changes on days 3 and 5. In addition, serum cTn-I levels, cytokine levels and virus titers were determined using chemiluminescence immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plaque assay, respectively, on days 3 and 5. Finally, the levels of phosphorylated p38MAPK were studied using immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting on day 5.", 
    "141": "Carvedilol had a stronger effect than metoprolol in reducing the pathological scores of VMC induced by CVB3. Both carvedilol and metoprolol reduced the levels of cTn-I, but the effect of carvedilol was stronger. Carvedilol and metoprolol decreased the levels of myocardial pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine, with the effects of carvedilol being stronger than those of metoprolol. Carvedilol had a stronger effect in reducing myocardial virus concentration compared with metoprolol. Carvedilol was stronger than metoprolol in decreasing the levels of myocardial phosphorylated p38MAPK.", 
    "142": "In conclusion, carvedilol was more potent than metoprolol in ameliorating myocardial lesions in VMC, probably due to its stronger modulation of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the activation of p38MAPK pathway through \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "143": "Progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with small airway obstruction by accumulation of inflammatory mucous exudates. However, the mechanism of mucin hypersecretion after exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) is still not clear. In this study, we explored the contribution of \u03b22-adrenoceptor (\u03b22-AR) signaling to CS extract (CSE)-induced mucus hypersecretion in vitro and examined the effect of a \u03b2-blocker on airway mucin hypersecretion in vivo. NCI-H292 epithelial cell line was used to determine the contribution of \u03b22-AR signaling to CSE-induced MUC5AC production by treatment with \u03b22-AR antagonists propranolol and ICI118551 and \u03b22-AR-targeted small interfering RNA. The effect of propranolol on airway mucus hypersecretion was examined in a rat model exposed to CS. MUC5AC expression was assayed by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and ELISA. \u03b22-AR and its downstream signaling were detected by western blot analysis. We found that pretreating NCI-H292 cells with propranolol, ICI118551 for 30 min or \u03b22AR-targeted siRNA for 48 h reduced MUC5AC mRNA and protein levels stimulated by CSE. However,inhibiting the classical \u03b22AR-cAMP-PKA pathway didn't attenuate CSE-induced MUC5AC production, while silencing \u03b2-arretin2 expression significantly decreased ERK and p38MAPK phosphorylation, thus reduced the CSE-stimulated MUC5AC production. In vivo, we found that administration of propranolol (25 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) for 28 days significantly attenuated the airway goblet cell metaplasia, mucus hypersecretion and MUC5AC expression of rats exposed to CS. From the study, \u03b22-AR-\u03b2-arrestin2-ERK1/2 signaling was required for CS-induced airway MUC5AC expression. Chronic propranolol administration ameliorated airway mucus hypersecretion and MUC5AC expression in smoking rats. The exploration of these mechanisms may contribute to the optimization of \u03b22-AR target therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

In the present study we have investigated the mechanisms of CXCL8 (IL-8) responses induced by 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells, with focus on the possible importance of Ca(2+)-signaling and activation of \u03b22-adrenergic receptors (\u03b22AR). Ca(2+)-chelator treatment obliterated 1-NP-induced CXCL8 (IL-8) responses. 1-NP at 10\u03bcM (but not 1\u03bcM) induced a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular Ca(2+)-levels ([Ca(2+)]i). The early but not the later, sustained phase of 1-NP-induced [Ca(2+)]i was suppressed by beta-blocker treatment (carazolol). Moreover, inhibition of \u03b22AR by blocking-antibody, beta-blocker treatment (ICI 118551) or siRNA transfection attenuated CXCL8 responses induced by 1-NP. The results confirm that PAHs may induce Ca(2+)-signaling also in BEAS-2B cells, at least partly through activation of \u03b22AR, and suggest that both \u03b22AR- and Ca(2+)-signaling may be involved in 1-NP-induced CXCL8 responses in bronchial epithelial cells.", 
    "153": "Restraint stress (RS) is an experimental model to study stress-related cardiovascular responses, characterized by sustained pressor and tachycardiac responses. We used pharmacologic and surgical procedures to investigate the role played by sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) in the mediation of stress-evoked cardiovascular responses. Ganglionic blockade with pentolinium significantly reduced RS-evoked pressor and tachycardiac responses. Intravenous treatment with homatropine methyl bromide did not affect the pressor response but increased tachycardia. Pretreatment with prazosin reduced the pressor and increased the tachycardiac response. Pretreatment with atenolol did not affect the pressor response but reduced tachycardia. The combined treatment with atenolol and prazosin reduced both pressor and tachycardiac responses. Adrenal demedullation reduced the pressor response without affecting tachycardia. Sinoaortic denervation increased pressor and tachycardiac responses. The results indicate that: (1) the RS-evoked cardiovascular response is mediated by the autonomic nervous system without an important involvement of humoral factors; (2) hypertension results primarily from sympathovascular and sympathoadrenal activation, without a significant involvement of the cardiac sympathetic component (CSNS); (3) the abrupt initial peak in the hypertensive response to restraint is sympathovascular-mediated, whereas the less intense but sustained hypertensive response observed throughout the remaining restraint session is mainly mediated by sympathoadrenal activation and epinephrine release; (4) tachycardia results from CSNS activation, and not from PSNS inhibition; (5) RS evokes simultaneous CSNS and PSNS activation, and heart rate changes are a vector of both influences; (6) the baroreflex is functional during restraint, and modulates both the vascular and cardiac responses to restraint.", 
    "154": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) constitute a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to ST-segment myocardial infarction. Myocardial ischemia in this context occurs as a result of an abrupt decrease in coronary blood flow and resultant imbalance in the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship. Coronary blood flow is further compromised by other mechanisms that increase coronary vascular resistance or reduce coronary driving pressure. The goals of treatment are to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, increase coronary blood flow and oxygen supply, and limit myocardial injury. Treatments are generally divided into disease-modifying agents or interventions that improve hard clinical outcomes and other strategies that can reduce ischemia. In addition to traditional drugs such as \u03b2-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, newer agents have expanded the number of molecular pathways targeted for treatment of ACS. Ranolazine, trimetazidine, nicorandil, and ivabradine are medications that have been shown to reduce myocardial ischemia through diverse mechanisms and have been tested in limited fashion in patients with ACS. Attenuating the no-reflow phenomenon and reducing the injury compounded by acute reperfusion after a period of coronary occlusion are active areas of research. Additionally, interventions aimed at ischemic pre- and postconditioning may be useful means by which to limit myocardial infarct size. Trials are also underway to examine altered metabolic and oxygen-related pathways in ACS. This review will discuss traditional and newer anti-ischemic therapies for patients with ACS, exclusive of revascularization, antithrombotic agents, and the use of high-intensity statins.",

Prior research has shown that reducing elevated systolic blood pressure lowers the risk of subsequent clinical complications from cardiovascular disease.

While there are many prognostic predictors, not all of them are applicable to individual patients. Global circumferential strain (GCS) was identified as a powerful prognostic marker, which appears to be a better parameter than LV global function for patients with depressed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. Seventy consecutive patients with newly-diagnosed DCM with LVEF of 28 \u00b1 8 % (all <45 %) were retrospectively recruited. Either carvedilol or bisoprolol was titrated to a dose that was tolerable for each of the patients. GCS was determined as the peak global speckle-tracking circumferential strain from the mid-LV short-axis view. LV reverse remodeling was defined as an absolute increase in LVEF of at least 10 % during 8.1 \u00b1 5.2-month follow-up after initiation of the maintenance dose of \u03b2-blockers. GCS \u2265 5.4 % was identified as the best predictor of LV reverse remodeling with 91 % sensitivity and 82 % specificity, and an area under the curve of 0.896 (p < 0.0001). An important finding of multivariate logistic regression analysis was that GCS was the best independent predictor of LV reverse remodeling (OR 7.692; 95 % CI 2.292-25.82; p = 0.001). It should be noted that only 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 min per patient was needed to analyze GCS.

In contrast, some airborne fungal strains like Bjerkandera adusta, Chaetomium sp, Coriolopsis sp., Fusarium solani and Mucor plumbeus showed NDM values exceeding those of the positive control, complete metabolism of the parent drug in some models and formation of NFM. NFM (numbers in brackets) were detected in four of the five model drugs: amitriptyline (18), metoprolol (4), mirtazapine (8), and zolpidem (2). The latter NFM are potential candidates for marker substances indicating post-mortem fungal metabolism.",

However, a number of issues limit the use of AIT, many of them being not actually supported by solid data from the literature. In particular, several contraindications to AIT deserve to be argued, being needed to accurately balance in single cases the benefits versus the disadvantages. This concerns comorbidities, such as autoimmune diseases and malignancies, concomitant drug treatments, particularly \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, pregnancy, patient's age, the severity of asthma, allergen polysensitization and the period of starting the treatment. Another important aspect producing misconceptions on AIT is the quality of the allergen extracts, because currently a patient with respiratory allergy to a given source may be prescribed to treat his allergyby products with very different quality. Improving characterization and standardization of allergen extracts will pave the way to the general acknowledgment of AIT as an effective treatment.",

A reduction of hospital referrals, an improvement in quality of life and an extension in life expectation by secondary prophylactic measures have been well documented. In addition to an optimized medicinal therapy, an often drastic change in lifestyle with a focus on a consistent abstinence from nicotine, a healthy diet and regular physical exercise is necessary. Data from healthcare research show that these targets are only insufficiently achieved. The implementation of current guidelines should therefore be rigorously applied. There is a need for research particularly with respect to the prognostic significance of beta blocker therapy for patients with stable coronary heart disease and preserved left ventricular function, the prognostic significance of targeted weight loss for overweight or obese coronary heart disease patients, the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in the various patient groups and their implementation into routine care.

    "167": "To report a sinus bradycardia induced by metoprolol and terbinafine drug-drug interaction and its management. A 63 year-old Caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. On the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. A score of 7 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. It was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.", 
    "168": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a late-onset, slowly progressing neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of glutamine repeats. The YAC128 mouse model has been widely used to study the progression of HD symptoms, but little is known about synaptic alterations in very old animals. The present experiments examined synaptic properties of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) in 16 month-old YAC128 mice. These mice were crossed with mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of either D1 or D2 dopamine receptor promoters to identify MSNs originating the direct and indirect pathways, respectively. The input-output curves of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents mediated by activation of the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were reduced in MSNs in both pathways. In the presence of DL-threo-\u03b2-Benzyloxyaspartic acid (DL-TBOA), a glutamate transporter blocker used to increase activation of extrasynaptic receptors, NMDA receptor-mediated currents displayed altered amplitudes, longer decay times, and greater charge (response areas) in both direct and indirect pathway MSNs in YAC128 mice compared to wildtype controls. Amplitudes were significantly increased, primarily in direct pathway MSNs while normalized areas were significantly increased only in indirect pathway MSNs, suggesting that the two types of MSNs are affected in different ways. It may be that indirect pathway neurons are more susceptible to changes in glutamate transport. Taken together, the present findings demonstrate differential alterations in synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in both direct and indirect pathway MSNs in late HD, which may contribute to the dysfunction and degeneration in both pathways.",

    "173": "The quality control (QC) theory of aging is based on the concept that aging is the result of a reduction in QC of cellular systems designed to maintain lifelong homeostasis. Four QC systems associated with aging are 1) inadequate protein processing in a distressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER); 2) histone deacetylase (HDAC) processing of genomic histones and gene silencing; 3) suppressed AMPK nutrient sensing with inefficient energy utilization and excessive fat accumulation; and 4) beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) signaling and environmental and emotional stress. Reprogramming these systems to maintain efficiency and prevent aging would be a rational strategy for increased lifespan and improved health. The QC theory can be tested with a pharmacological approach using three well-known and safe, FDA-approved drugs: 1) phenyl butyric acid, a chemical chaperone that enhances ER function and is also an HDAC inhibitor, 2) metformin, which activates AMPK and is used to treat type 2 diabetes, and 3) propranolol, a beta blocker which inhibits BAR signaling and is used to treat hypertension and anxiety. A critical aspect of the QC theory, then, is that aging is associated with multiple cellular systems that can be targeted with drug combinations more effectively than with single drugs. But more importantly, these drug combinations will effectively prevent, delay, or reverse chronic diseases of aging that impose such a tremendous health burden on our society.",

To analyze the effects of highly selective blocker GAT1, NO-711, and substrate inhibitor GAT3, \u03b2-alanine, on the initial velocity of [(3)H]GABA uptake by cortical, hippocampal, and thalamic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) after perinatal hypoxia. METHODS. Animals were divided into two groups: control (n=17) and hypoxia (n=12). Rats in the hypoxia group underwent hypoxia and seizures (airtight chamber, 4% O2 and 96% N2) at the age of 10-12 postnatal days and were used in the experiments 8-9 weeks after hypoxia. RESULTS. In cortical synaptosomes, the effects of NO-711 (30 \u03bc\u039c) and \u03b2-alanine (100 \u03bc\u039c) on [(3)H]GABA uptake were similar in control and hypoxia groups. In hippocampal synaptosomes, NO-711 inhibited 84.3% of the initial velocity of [(3)H]GABA uptake in normal conditions and 80.1% after hypoxia, whereas the effect of \u03b2-alanine was increased after hypoxia from 14.4% to 22.1%. In thalamic synaptosomes, the effect of NO-711 was decreased by 79.6% in controls and by 70.9% in hypoxia group, whereas the effect of \u03b2-alanine was increased after hypoxia from 20.2% to 30.2%. CONCLUSIONS. The effectiveness of \u03b2-alanine to influence GABA uptake was increased in hippocampal and thalamic nerve terminals as a result of perinatal hypoxia and the effectiveness of NO-711 in thalamic nerve terminals was decreased. These results may indicate changes in the ratio of active GAT1/GAT3 expressed in the plasma membrane of nerve terminals after perinatal hypoxia. We showed a possibility to modulate non-GAT1 GABA transporter activity in different brain regions by exogenous and endogenous \u03b2-alanine.",

Their target, the \u03b23-adrenoceptor, was discovered much later than \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoceptors and exhibits unique properties which make extrapolation of findings from the other two subtypes difficult and the \u03b23-adrenoceptor a less-understood subtype. This article discusses three aspects of \u03b23-adrenoceptor pharmacology. First, the ligand-recognition profile of \u03b23-adrenoceptors differs considerably from that of the other two subtypes, i.e., many antagonists considered as nonselective actually are \u03b23-sparing, including propranolol or nadolol. Many agonists and antagonists classically considered as being \u03b23-selective actually are not, including BRL 37,344 ((\u00b1)-(R*,R*)-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]phenoxy] acetic acid sodium hydrate) or SR 59,230 (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-[(1S)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphth-1-ylamino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate). Moreover, the binding pocket apparently differs between the human and rodent \u03b23-adrenoceptor, yielding considerable species differences in potency. Second, the expression pattern of \u03b23-adrenoceptors is more restricted than that of other subtypes, particularly in humans; this makes extrapolation of rodent findings to the human situation difficult, but it may result in a smaller potential for side effects. The role of \u03b23-adrenoceptor gene polymorphisms has insufficiently been explored and may differ even between primate species. Third, \u03b23-adrenoceptors lack the phosphorylation sites involved in agonist-induced desensitization of the other two subtypes. Thus, they exhibit downregulation and/or desensitization in some, but not other, cell types and tissues. When desensitization occurs, it most often is at the level of mRNA or signaling molecule expression. All three of these factors have implications for future studies to better understand the \u03b23-adrenoceptor as a novel pharmacological target.",

Baseline characteristics, home and in-hospital treatments, mortality rates, and major bleeding were compared separately for STEMI and NSTEMI by prior MI status, with adjustment for mortality and major bleeding.", 
    "182": "Prior MI was documented in 19% of STEMI (n = 124,535) and 29% of NSTEMI (n = 194,617) patients, who were older, were more likely to have comorbidities or prior revascularization, and were more commonly taking secondary prevention medications at home. Guideline-recommended treatments in-hospital and at discharge did not differ in prior-MI STEMI patients, but invasive management was lower for prior-MI NSTEMI patients. The frequency of in-hospital mortality was higher for prior-MI STEMI (5.9% vs. 5.2%) and NSTEMI patients (4.3% vs. 3.4%). After adjustment, the excess mortality risk associated with prior MI was no longer present for STEMI (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.15), with only modest excess risk for NSTEMI (odds ratio = 1.10, 95% CI 1.04-1.15). The risk of in-hospital major bleeding was marginally lower for prior-MI NSTEMI.",

    "184": "There is no uniform pretreatment cardiac evaluation for infants treated with oral propranolol, which is now the drug of choice for hemangiomas of infancy requiring systemic medical intervention. The aim of this study was to report and evaluate the findings of pretreatment cardiac evaluation. Data were reviewed for patients evaluated by a single hemangioma specialist and a single pediatric cardiologist prior to initiation of propranolol for infantile hemangioma. Cardiac evaluation included a complete echocardiogram. From July 2009 through January 2013, 239 consecutive patients 12 months of age or younger (median 2.7 months) were screened. No patients had cardiac contraindications to propranolol. However, 50 patients (21%) had an abnormal echocardiogram: 39 atrial septal defects (5 associated with right heart enlargement), 6 ventricular septal defects, 2 patent ductus arteriosus, 1 aortic coarctation, 1 pulmonary valve stenosis, and 1 aberrant subclavian artery. Overall, 69 patients had an audible heart murmur, 44 of which were not associated with pathologic findings on echocardiogram. All patients with a ventricular septal defect and 16 of 39 with an atrial septal defect had a murmur. Two of seven patients with PHACE syndrome had cardiac anomalies. None of the findings precluded the use of propranolol. Assisted reproductive technologies were used in 18% of pregnancies, including in vitro fertilization in 12%. Cardiac contraindications to propranolol treatment are uncommon in patients with infantile hemangioma. However, anatomic abnormalities were more common than reported in the general population. Further study is necessary to determine whether there is a pathogenic relationship between cardiac defects and nonsyndromic infantile hemangioma.", 
    "185": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a vital class of proteins that transduce biological signals across the cell membrane. However, their allosteric activation mechanism is not fully understood; crystal structures of active and inactive receptors have been reported, but the functional pathway between these two states remains elusive. Here, we use structure-based (G\u014d-like) models to simulate activation of two GPCRs, rhodopsin and the \u03b2\u2082 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2\u2082AR). We used data-derived reaction coordinates that capture the activation mechanism for both proteins, showing that activation proceeds through quantitatively different paths in the two systems. Both reaction coordinates are determined from the dominant concerted motions in the simulations so the technique is broadly applicable. There were two surprising results. First, the main structural changes in the simulations were distributed throughout the transmembrane bundle, and not localized to the obvious areas of interest, such as the intracellular portion of Helix 6. Second, the activation (and deactivation) paths were distinctly nonmonotonic, populating states that were not simply interpolations between the inactive and active structures. These transitions also suggest a functional explanation for \u03b2\u2082AR's basal activity: it can proceed through a more broadly defined path during the observed transitions.", 
    "186": "The aim of the present study was to develop a method for water flux reabsorption measurement in Doluisio's Perfusion Technique based on the use of phenol red as a non-absorbable marker and to validate it by comparison with gravimetric procedure. The compounds selected for the study were metoprolol, atenolol, cimetidine and cefadroxil in order to include low, intermediate and high permeability drugs absorbed by passive diffusion and by carrier mediated mechanism. The intestinal permeabilities (Peff) of the drugs were obtained in male and female Wistar rats and calculated using both methods of water flux correction. The absorption rate coefficients of all the assayed compounds did not show statistically significant differences between male and female rats consequently all the individual values were combined to compare between reabsorption methods. The absorption rate coefficients and permeability values did not show statistically significant differences between the two strategies of concentration correction. The apparent zero order water absorption coefficients were also similar in both correction procedures. In conclusion gravimetric and phenol red method for water reabsorption correction are accurate and interchangeable for permeability estimation in closed loop perfusion method.", 
    "187": "Infectious complications are the leading cause of death in the post-acute phase of stroke. Post-stroke immunodeficiency is believed to result from neurohormonal dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, the differential effects of these neuroendocrine systems on the peripheral immune cells are only partially understood. Here, we determined the impact of the hormones of the SNS and HPA on distinct immune cell populations and characterized their interactions after stroke. At various time points after cortical or extensive hemispheric cerebral ischemia, plasma cortisone, corticosterone, metanephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels were measured in mice. Leukocyte subpopulations were flow cytometrically analyzed in spleen and blood. To investigate their differential sensitivity to stress hormones, splenocytes were incubated in vitro with prednisolone, epinephrine and their respective receptor blockers. Glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) and beta2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b22-AR) on leukocyte subpopulations were quantified by flow cytometry. In vivo effects of GCR and selective \u03b22-AR blockade, respectively, were defined on serum hormone concentrations, lymphopenia and interferon-\u03b3 production after severe ischemia. We found elevated cortisone, corticosterone and metanephrine levels and associated lymphocytopenia only after extensive brain infarction. Prednisolone resulted in a 5 times higher cell death rate of splenocytes than epinephrine in vitro. Prednisolone and epinephrine-induced leukocyte cell death was prevented by GCR and \u03b22-AR blockade, respectively. In vivo, only GCR blockade prevented post ischemic lymphopenia whereas \u03b22-AR preserved interferon-\u03b3 secretion by lymphocytes. GCR blockade increased metanephrine levels in vivo and prednisolone, in turn, decreased \u03b22-AR expression on lymphocytes. In conclusion, mediators of the SNS and the HPA axis differentially affect the systemic immune system after stroke. Moreover, our findings suggest a negative-feedback of corticosteroids on the sympathetic axis which may control the post-stroke stress-reaction. This complex interplay between the HPA and the SNS after stroke has to be considered when targeting the neurohormonal systems in the post acute phase of severe stroke.", 
    "188": "The effects of acute treatment with sibutramine on the peripheral sympathetic neurotransmission in vas deferens of young rats were still not evaluated. Therefore, we carried out this study in order to verify the effects of acute sibutramine treatment on the neuronal- and exogenous agonist-induced contractions of the young rat vas deferens. Young 45-day-old male Wistar rats were pretreated with sibutramine 6 mg/kg and after 4h the vas deferens was used for experiment. The acute treatment with sibutramine was able to increase the potency (pD2) of noradrenaline and phenylephrine. Moreover, the efficacy (Emax) of noradrenaline was increased while the efficacy of serotonin and nicotine were decreased. The maximum effect induced by a single concentration of tyramine was diminished in the vas deferens from treated group. Moreover, the leftward shift of the noradrenaline curves promoted by uptake blockers (cocaine and corticosterone) and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol) was reduced in the vas deferens of treated group. The initial phasic and secondary tonic components of the neuronal-evoked contractions of vas deferens from treated group at the frequencies of 2 Hz were decreased. Moreover, only the initial phasic component at 5 Hz was diminished by the acute treatment with sibutramine. In conclusion, we showed that the acute treatment with sibutramine in young rats was able to affect the peripheral sympathetic nervous system by inhibition of noradrenaline uptake and reduction of the neuronal content of this neurotransmitter, leading to an enhancement of vas deferens sensitivity to noradrenaline.", 
    "189": "While it is relatively uncommon, an overdose of calcium-channel blockers, beta blockers, or digoxin has a significant morbidity and mortality rate, and its management can be complex. Digoxin toxicity can present with an acute overdose or as chronic toxicity while a patient is on therapeutic dosing, which has implications for diagnosis and management. While the patient's specific clinical presentation may depend on factors such as the time of exposure and the type of agent ingested, the differential diagnosis of the bradycardic and hypotensive patient is narrow, and toxicity from these agents must be considered. This review provides an evidence-based overview of the emergency department management of calcium-channel blocker overdose, beta blocker overdose, and digoxin toxicity.",

After 2 years, therapy persistence was 58.9% and varied according to initial class prescribed, from 52.3% for diuretics to 64.1% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Class persistence ranged from 25.3% for diuretics to 35.8% for angiotensin II receptor blockers. Therapy persistence rates were greater in new users from more recent years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.27). Subgroups that demonstrated poorer persistence included patients older than 75 years (aOR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.96), those with lowest neighbourhood income quintile (aOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.80-0.83 compared with the highest quintile), those from urban vs rural areas (aOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.81-0.84), and those who started on diuretics as initial monotherapy compared with all other drug classes.",

This document is not a comprehensive overview of TAD and important elements of the epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, and management of acute aortic syndromes are deliberately not discussed; readers are referred to the 2010 guidelines published by the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, American Association for Thoracic Surgery, and other stakeholders. Rather, this document is a practical guide for clinicians managing adult patients with TAD. Topics covered include size thresholds for surgical intervention, emerging therapies, imaging modalities, medical and lifestyle management, and genetics of TAD. The primary panel consisted of experts from a variety of disciplines that are essential for comprehensive management of TAD patients. The methodology involved a focused literature review with an emphasis on updates since 2010 and the use of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology to arrive at specific recommendations. The final document then underwent review by a secondary panel. This document aims to provide recommendations for most patients and situations. However, the ultimate judgement regarding the management of any individual patients should be made by their health care team.",

Propranolol (PPN) hydrochloride was selected as a model drug with good water solubility, short half life and bitter taste. The PPN-fiber complexes (PF) were prepared by a batch process and coated with Eudragit(\u00ae) RS100. Gamma scintigraphy was performed on fasted volunteers revealed about 30% ZB-1 and more than 50% coated ZB-1 were still remaining in the stomach at 6h. In vitro results showed the releases of PF and coated PPN-fiber complexes (C-PF) were sustained. The release, drug content and particle size of C-PF were influenced by coat to core ratio, concentration of coating material and rotation rate. The suspension was stable after standing for 30 days in 0.5% Carbopol(\u00ae) with no release rate and taste changed. The administration of C-PF suspension to rats resulted a significant different (P<0.05) improvement of the plasma drug level and prolongation of the release. However, because of the burst effect, the Cmax values of PF suspension didn't differ from drug solution (P>0.05). Furthermore, a linear relationship between in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption was observed.",

    "201": "Association between hypertension and bladder symptoms has been described. We hypothesized that micturition dysfunction may be associated with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) acting in urethra. The effects of the anti-hypertensive drugs losartan (AT1 antagonist) and captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) in comparison with atenolol (\u03b21-adrenoceptor antagonist independently of RAS blockade) have been investigated in bladder and urethral dysfunctions during renovascular hypertension in rats. Two kidney-1 clip (2K-1C) rats were treated with losartan (30 mg/kg/day), captopril (50mg/kg/day) or atenolol (90 mg/kg/day) for eight weeks. Cystometric study, bladder and urethra smooth muscle reactivities, measurement of cAMP levels and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in urinary tract were determined. Losartan and captopril markedly reduced blood pressure in 2K-1C rats. The increases in non-voiding contractions, voiding frequency and bladder capacity in 2K-1C rats were prevented by treatments with both drugs. Likewise, losartan and captopril prevented the enhanced bladder contractions to electrical-field stimulation (EFS) and carbachol, along with the impaired relaxations to \u03b2-adrenergic-cAMP stimulation. Enhanced neurogenic contractions and impaired nitrergic relaxations were observed in urethra from 2K-1C rats. Angiotensin II also produced greater urethral contractions that were accompanied by higher phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in urethral tissues of 2K-1C rats. Losartan and captopril normalized the urethral dysfunctions in 2K-1C rats. In contrast, atenolol treatment largely reduced the blood pressure in 2K-1C rats but failed to affect the urinary tract smooth muscle dysfunction. The urinary tract smooth muscle dysfunction in 2K-1C rats takes place by local RAS activation irrespective of levels of arterial blood pressure."
