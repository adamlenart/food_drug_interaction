Caffeine increased the resting pulse and hand movement. Although the beta-adrenergic blocker and the combination of caffeine and this drug decreased the resting heart rate from that of placebo, they did not significantly change hand steadiness. However, compared with caffeine alone, the beta-adrenergic blocker-caffeine combination significantly decreased hand movement and the pulse. Resting the wrist significantly steadied hand movements. Hand movement was not correlated with the level of ophthalmology training, the trainee's weight, or their daily caffeine consumption.", 
    "1": "This study was designed to determine whether gastroduodenal ulcer influences propranolol absorption. Eleven patients with peptic ulcer disease and eight healthy subjects received 80 mg of propranolol orally. Serum propranolol levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. Ulcer patients showed a significant decrease in mean peak concentration of propranolol (90 +/- 12 ng/ml versus 151 +/- 23 ng/ml) (p < 0.025), in the absorption constant (1.43 +/- 0.21 h-1 versus 0.96 +/- 0.12 h-1) (p < 0.05), and in the area under concentration-time curve (802 +/- 129 ng/ml.h versus 492 +/- 73 ng/ml.h) (p < 0.05). No significant difference was seen in drug effect on the heart at 90 min. We conclude that propranolol is absorbed more slowly in ulcer patients than in healthy subjects, but this delay has no clinical effect after a single dose.", 
    "2": "Spontaneous tailflicks, measured as elevation of the tail above the body axis in restrained animals, have been studied in both adult and young rats. The selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), induced dose-related increases in spontaneous tailflicks in adult (> 60 days) male rats. These responses were antagonised by the 5-HT1A antagonists (-)-propranolol and (-)-pindolol. 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) induced tailflicks could be observed in 30, 25 and 20 day old male rats and were also antagonised by (-)-propranolol and (-)-pindolol although drug-induced rotation of the 20 and 25 day old animals hindered assessment. At 14 and 10 days, 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) produced Straub tail responses which precluded the observation of tailflicks. Lower doses of 8-OH-DPAT, which did not elicit Straub tail in these younger animals also failed to produce tailflicks. Thus 8-OH-DPAT induced spontaneous tailflicks reflect in vivo activation of 5-HT1A receptors in adult and 30 day old male rats but are inappropriate for the study of 5-HT1A mediated behaviour in younger animals.", 
    "3": "Correction of high grade carotid artery stenosis may result in cerebral hyperperfusion because of defective vascular autoregulation. Thus, transcranial Doppler was used to determine mean arterial flow velocity (Vmean) of the middle cerebral artery in 95 patients before and after carotid endarterectomy. Attention was focused on postoperative episodes of ipsilateral headache and hypertension. Symptoms of cerebral hyperperfusion lasted for 3 (1.5-5) h (median and range) in nine patients, and for 12 (8-14) days in nine other patients. Of these later patients, two developed seizures on the 5th and 6th postoperative day, respectively. The mean pressure difference across the stenosis was 31 (0-63) mmHg in the symptomatic group (n = 18) as opposed to only 10 (0-60) mmHg in the asymptomatic group (n = 77) (p < 0.01). In the 18 patients with headache after surgery, ipsilateral Vmean increased to 177 (130-332)% of the preoperative value (p < 0.0001), while the contralateral Vmean remained unchanged. After blood pressure was reduced in symptomatic patients with labetalol, ipsilateral Vmean decreased from 92 (69-124) to 56 (32-93) cm s-1 (p < 0.0001) as systemic arterial pressure decreased from 101 (80-128) to 88 (60-103) mmHg, with no change in contralateral Vmean. Normalisation of Vmean via reduction of arterial pressure ended episodes of headache and seizure in symptomatic patients. Thus, in patients who developed post-endarterectomy hyperperfusion, these findings clearly demonstrated that ipsilateral middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity was pressure dependent. This substantiates the hypothesis of defective autoregulation in the ipsilateral hemisphere after carotid endarterectomy, and in turn demonstrates an immediate cessation of symptoms with reduction of arterial pressure even in normotensive patients.", 
    "4": "1. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the cellular mechanism of the positive inotropic effect of hydralazine, a vasodilator widely used for afterload reduction in patients with heart failure that has also been reported to have positive inotropic effects on the heart. After isolation, right ventricular papillary muscles from the ferret were maintained in bicarbonate-buffered salt solution (30 degrees C). A concentration-response relationship was obtained for hydralazine (10(-6) to 10(-3) M). In order to mimic different levels of catecholamine release found in heart failure, we utilized two methods of stimulation: (a) threshold punctate pulses and (b) suprathreshold punctate stimulation with voltage approximately 10% above threshold. 2. In a first group of muscles (n = 16), a maximally effective concentration of hydralazine (10(-3) M) increased peak isometric tension by 39 +/- 9% (P < 0.05). Doses lower than 10(-5) M had no significant effect. The bioluminescent Ca2+ indicator, aequorin, was loaded into a subset of these muscles (n = 7). A significant increase in peak light (i.e., intracellular Ca2+) developed, concurrently with an increase in peak tension (38 +/- 5% to 66 +/- 8%). This inotropic response was associated with a decrease in time to peak tension (ms), 221 +/- 7 to 186 +/- 5 (P < 0.05), and time to peak light, 65 +/- 4 to 52 +/- 2 (P < 0.05). These effects were markedly attenuated by pretreatment with autonomic blocking agents. 3. In a second group of muscles (n = 12), histamine was used to stimulate cyclic AMP production in the presence of propranolol. Hydralazine (3 x 10-4 M) led to a shift in the pD2 (i.e. the negative log of the concentration of histamine producing 50% of the maximal response) from 6.1 +/- 0.1 to 5.9 +/- 0.1(P <0.05), thus increasing the sensitivity of the muscles to histamine. Hydralazine also increased maximum tension from 160 +/- 77% to 195 +/- 57% (P <0.05) above baseline. Thus, hydralazine altered the potency and efficacy of histamine despite the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.4. A third group of muscles were chemically skinned to examine the effects of hydralazine on myofilament Ca2+ responsiveness. Pretreatment of ferret papillary muscles with hydralazine (10-3 M)before skinning did not shift the force-pCa curve after skinning (n = 16). However, hydralazine added to previously skinned fibres desensitized the myofilaments, as indicated by a rightward shift of the force-pCa curve (n = 12). Maximum tension development was not changed.5. The pharmacological effects of hydralazine are characteristic of inotropic drugs that act mainly via cyclic AMP; however, the increase in peak tension demonstrated with histamine in the presence of hydralazine also suggests an effect on cyclic AMP-independent second messenger pathways. These data are consistent with reports that large doses of hydralazine may increase cellular levels of cyclic AMP, as well as other second messengers, by direct cardiac and indirect neuronal mechanisms.", 
    "5": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) evoked potent contractile responses in phenoxybenzamine-treated ring segments of rat caudal artery, partially contracted with U46619. Responses were mimicked by 5-HT1-selective agonists with the potency order: RU24969 > 5-carboxamidotryptamine > 5-HT = CP-93,129 > sumatriptan. 8-Hydroxy-N,N-dipropylaminotetralin was virtually inactive. Responses were unaffected by spiperone (0.1 microM) and mesulergine (1.0 microM), but were antagonized competitively by (+/-)-cyanopindolol affording agonist-independent pKB estimates of 8.4 to 8.9. The pharmacological profile of this receptor is consistent with that of the 5-HT1B subtype. Since the 5-HT1B receptor is the rodent homologue of the 5-HT1D beta subtype, it might be anticipated that 5-HT1D beta receptors will be found to mediate vasoconstrictor responses in non-rodent species.", 
    "6": "Eighty-seven patients with paroxysmal tachydysrhythmias were submitted to clinical and laboratory evaluation and electrophysiologic studies were performed during the 3rd, 6th and 12th months of the therapy with propranolol or metoprolol. Metoprolol did not induce any significant change in sinoatrial correct time, in sinoatrial recovery time or in corrected sinoatrial recovery time. It decreases significantly the effective and functional AV refractory periods as well as increases the effective refractory period of the additional pathway. The mechanism of tachycardia preventing an involvement of the additional pathway in retrograde direction consists in the appearance of a block in the indicated additional pathway. The results of the humoral aspects are the following: propranolol inhibits the functions of the thyroid and sexual glands both in acute tests and in tests performed during the 3rd, 6th and 12th month of therapy; metoprolol has no significant effect on the functions of the thyroid and sexual glands; apparently, it influences the cardiac conduction system and myocardium directly.", 
    "7": "Autoradiographic techniques revealed that 5-hydroxytryptamine1A, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B and 5-hydroxytryptamine1C/2 binding sites are differentially distributed in the spinal cords of adult male rats. In the dorsal horn, 5-hydroxytryptamine1A sites were dense in all laminae; 5-hydroxytryptamine1B sites were more dense in laminae I, III and IV than in lamina II; while 5-hydroxytryptamine1C/2 sites were very sparse. The dorsal commissure gray matter also exhibited very dense 5-hydroxytryptamine1A and 5-hydroxytryptamine1B binding. In the intermediate and central gray matter, all three sites were moderately dense at autonomic levels, with exceptionally dense1C/2 binding restricted to the intermediolateral nucleus at rostral thoracic levels. In the ventral horn, 5-hydroxytryptamine1A and 5-hydroxytryptamine1B sites were very sparse (except for very dense 5-hydroxytryptamine1A sites located in the dorsolateral nucleus of the pudendal nerve), while 5-hydroxytryptamine1C/2 sites were relatively dense in motor nuclei. Surprisingly, 5-hydroxytryptamine1B sites were moderately dense in the dorsal column corticospinal tract. These studies will provide an anatomical perspective for interpretation of the complex role of 5-hydroxytryptamine in regulating spinal cord function.",

    "9": "Twenty-five normotensive patients with stable angina, angiographically documented coronary disease and normal left ventricular function were randomized to a crossover study comparing atenolol 100 mg x 1, sustained-release diltiazem 120 mg x 2, and their combination. A maximal symptom limited bicycle exercise test and a 24-h ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring were performed at the end of each treatment period. Exercise duration was increased equally in the different treatment groups. Time to onset of 1-mm ST-segment depression was longer with atenolol (P < 0.02) and combination therapy (P < 0.01) than with diltiazem. The maximal ST-segment depression was decreased with atenolol (P < 0.05) and combination therapy (P < 0.02), whereas, time to onset of angina was prolonged only with combination therapy (P < 0.03). The number of ischaemic episodes during ambulatory monitoring was lower with atenolol and combination therapy than with diltiazem (P < 0.01). The difference between atenolol and diltiazem was mainly due to lower ischaemic activity with atenolol between 06:00 h and 12:00 h (P < 0.05). Anginal frequency (P < 0.01) and nitroglycerin consumption (P < 0.05) were lower with combination therapy than with monotherapy. Thus, while comparable effects were achieved on clinical variables, atenolol appeared to be more effective than diltiazem, reducing myocardial ischaemia during exercise and ambulatory monitoring. With combination therapy, both clinical and electrocardiograph signs of ischaemia were improved.",

    "12": "Total exercise duration and time to 1-mm ST-segment depression was significantly prolonged by nicardipine and atenolol when compared to placebo, the combination offered no additional benefit. Time to onset of angina was significantly prolonged by nicardipine and the combination but not by atenolol. Indices of left ventricular function were not significantly affected by any treatment other than an increase in left ventricular end diastolic volume on atenolol and the combination.", 
    "13": "Nicardipine and atenolol are equally effective in prolonging exercise duration and time to onset of ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina while the combination appeared to offer no additional benefit. Nicardipine prolonged the time to onset of angina significantly; again there was no further improvement with the combination. Neither drug appears to have an important effect on the parameters of diastolic function studied in patients with chronic stable angina.", 
    "14": "When rabbit ventricular myocytes were cultured for 1 wk and then exposed to alpha- and/or beta-adrenergic agonists, such nonbeating heart cell preparations disclosed increased protein-to-DNA ratios and elevated RNA content, indicative of cellular hypertrophy. Norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine provoked hypertrophy with norepinephrine eliciting a greater response than isoproterenol or phenylephrine. Specific alpha- and beta-antagonists blocked growth by inhibiting catecholamine-induced changes in protein turnover. Each catecholamine enhanced the fractional rate of protein synthesis within 48 h; however, changes in growth rates appeared to be modulated, in part, by alterations in protein degradation. Even though rates of total protein and actin synthesis resembled values measured in vivo, myosin heavy chain fractional rate of synthesis was only 22% of in vivo levels. Double label immunofluorescence microscopy further illustrated that catecholamine treatment accelerated myofibrillar disruption in these quiescent heart cells. These observations suggested that in the absence of beating, neurohumoral modulation of contractile protein turnover was not associated with the maintenance of myofibrillar integrity even though catecholamines induced cellular hypertrophy.",

    "17": "Questionnaire data was obtained from members of the AAAI and the American College of Allergy and Immunology, regarding 17 fatalities associated with immunotherapy for the years 1985 to 1989. In this period, no fatalities were reported with skin testing. The mean age of patients who died was 36.0 years (range: 10 to 77 years), and 69% were female. Of the patients who died, 76% had asthma, and most were reported to have had factors associated with severity (i.e., lability, required steroids, and/or prior hospitalizations). The only patient who had rhinitis alone had cardiovascular disease and was receiving a beta-blocker. High sensitivity by skin test or RAST was reported by 71%, and 36% reported prior systemic reactions. Sixty-five percent of the patients were undergoing build-up therapy. Fatalities involved use of allergen doses between 1:1 million to 1:10 wt/vol. Other factors associated with fatalities were: changing to a new vial of extract, 5; dosing error or inappropriate dose adjustment, 5; allergen season, 5; symptomatic before injection, 4; not waiting after injection, 2; and home injection, 1. Onset of anaphylaxis occurred within 20 minutes in eleven patients, within 20 to 30 minutes in one, and after more than 30 minutes in one. In eleven cases the cause of death was associated with respiratory compromise. These data reinforce the need for special precautions in treating high-risk patients with asthma. The annual fatality rate from administration of allergenic extracts in the United States remains very low: 1 fatality per 2 million doses, but additional educational efforts to further reduce the fatality rate are needed.", 
    "18": "The effects of isradipine and metoprolol were studied on the brachial arteries of two groups of 14 patients with hypertension, 90 minutes after the first dose and after 3 months of treatment. Diameter (pulsed Doppler) and compliance (pulse-wave velocity) were measured and calculated in isobaric conditions by way of a model that allowed discrimination of the active intrinsic drug action. Isradipine increased measured and isobaric diameter during short-term (p < 0.05) and long-term administration (p < 0.05), whereas metoprolol did not change it. Active diameter effects were different between drugs during short-term administration (p < 0.05). Isaradipine increased measured and isobaric compliance during short-term (p < 0.05) and long-term administration (p < 0.05). Short-term administration of metoprolol decreased measured compliance (p < 0.01). Metoprolol decreased isobaric compliance during short-term (p < 0.01) and long-term (p < 0.05) administration. Active compliance effects were different between drugs during short- and long-term administration (p < 0.01). These arterial intrinsic drug effects, independent of the pressure-lowering influence, suggested different mechanisms, consisting of a large artery smooth muscle relaxation for isradipine and an isometric arterial constriction for metoprolol.", 
    "19": "Carvedilol is a cardiovascular drug currently used for the treatment of hypertension. Clinical studies have recently demonstrated efficacy in angina and congestive heart failure. Recently, carvedilol has been shown to attenuate oxygen free radical-initiated lipid peroxidation and to inhibit vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis induced by a wide variety of growth factors. These findings are of interest since smooth muscle proliferation and abnormal lipid metabolism are proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaque formation and in development of stenotic lesions following vascular injury by balloon angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting. On the basis of these observations, the antiproliferative actions of carvedilol have been explored in detail. In human cultured pulmonary artery vascular smooth muscle cells, carvedilol (0.1-10 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the mitogenesis stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, thrombin, and serum, with IC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 2.0 microM. Carvedilol also produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor, with an IC50 value of 3 microM. The extensive neointimal formation that occurs following balloon angioplasty of rat carotid arteries was markedly attenuated by carvedilol (1 mg/kg, i.p.; twice daily starting 3 days before angioplasty and continuing until 14 days after angioplasty). Quantitative image analysis demonstrated that carvedilol reduced the neointimal growth following angioplasty by 84% without altering either medial or adventitial cross-sectional areas. These observations indicate that carvedilol may also be effective in the treatment of pathological disorders principally associated with abnormal vascular smooth muscle growth, such as atherosclerosis and acute vascular wall injury induced by angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "20": "Most studies testing vasoactive agents in portal-hypertensive rats have been performed in young animals. To assess age-related changes in hemodynamic responses to adrenergic stimuli, we examined (a) responsiveness to norepinephrine (0.14 to 12.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) in young (3-mo-old) and aged (9-mo-old) sham-operated and portal-hypertensive rats and (b) response to propranolol (2 and 10 mg.kg-1 body wt), nitroglycerin (3.6 mg.kg-1.min-1) or saline solution in aged portal-hypertensive rats. Aged rats exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) smaller responses to norepinephrine with regard to increases in mean arterial pressure and superior mesenteric arterial vascular resistance, irrespective of portal hypertension. Portal hypertension alone potentiated this reduced response in aged animals and was associated with cardiovascular hyporesponsiveness to norepinephrine in young rats. Portal pressure was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in aged sham-operated rats than in young sham-operated rats over a wide range of norepinephrine doses. Portal-hypertensive aged rats showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower heart rates. Furthermore, systemic and splanchnic cardiovascular responses to propranolol and nitroglycerin mediated by the sympathetic nervous system were decreased or negligible in aged rats, compromising the portal-hypotensive effects of these drugs. In summary, aged rats express diminished cardiovascular responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli. Therefore age should be considered an important factor in studies evaluating pharmacological agents for the treatment of portal hypertension.", 
    "21": "The effects of intravenous boluses of amiodarone (5 mg/kg), racemic sotalol (enantiomeric ratio d/l-sotalol 1:1;1.5 mg/kg), and d-sotalol (0.75 mg/kg) on mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), total peripheral resistance (TPR), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and peak rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dp/dt) were assessed in conscious rabbits. Amiodarone and sotalol had a modest negative inotropic effect: amiodarone reduced peak LV dp/dt by 8 +/ 2% (mean +/- SEM) (p < 0.05) and sotalol by 6 +/- 2% (p < 0.05). These two drugs had quite different effects on CO as a result of differences in their actions on peripheral blood vessels: amiodarone caused a 13 +/- 3% (p < 0.05) increase in CO associated with a substantial vasodilatory effect (TPR reduced 25 +/- 3%; p < 0.01); sotalol did not produce any substantial change in either CO or TPR. Bolus intravenous injection of amiodarone was associated with a significant increase in HR (12 +/- 3%; p < 0.01), whereas sotalol reduced HR by 7 +/- 1% (p < 0.05). In contrast, administration of the dextro-rotatory optical isomer, d-sotalol, produced no significant change in peak LV dp/dt, LVEDP, CO, TPR, or HR. These results confirm that amiodarone and racemic sotalol have a comparatively weak cardiodepressant action. The experiments also show that the reduction in cardiac performance associated with racemic sotalol is mediated predominantly through the beta-adrenoreceptor blocking action of the levo-rotatory isomer (l-sotalol) rather than any substantial cardiodepressant effect of the dextro-rotatory isomer.", 
    "22": "Identification of whether episodes of ambulatory ischemia are caused by increases in myocardial oxygen demand or to episodic coronary vasoconstriction in patients with stable coronary disease may be important to guide selection of optimal anti-ischemic therapy and to gain insight into mechanisms responsible for adverse cardiac events.", 
    "23": "Mean minute heart rate activity during ambulatory ECG (AECG) monitoring was determined for 50 patients treated with propranolol, diltiazem, nifedipine, or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial. Periods of heart rate increases of various magnitudes and durations and starting at various baseline heart rates on each therapy were identified throughout each 48-hour AECG recording, and the proportion of these periods associated with an ischemic episode was determined. The circadian variation of ischemic episodes categorized by the presence or absence of an increase in heart rate was analyzed. Eighty-one percent of ischemic episodes were preceded by an increase in heart rate > or = 5 beats per minute. The likelihood of developing ischemia associated with a heart rate increase was proportional to the magnitude and duration of the heart rate increase and the baseline heart rate before the increases in heart rate: likelihood ranged from 4% when the heart rate increased 5-9 beats per minute and lasted < 10 minutes to 60% when the heart rate increased > or = 20 beats per minute and lasted > or = 40 minutes. The likelihoods of developing ischemia based on changes in the heart rate variables were similar for each of the therapies. Propranolol therapy significantly reduced the magnitude and duration of heart rate increase and the baseline heart rate compared with therapy with placebo, diltiazem, or nifedipine (P < .001). Ischemic episodes associated with a heart rate increase displayed a daytime peak, whereas ischemia occurring without a heart rate increase occurred evenly throughout the day. Propranolol reduced the proportion of heart rate-related ischemic episodes and increased the proportion of non-heart rate-related episodes compared with placebo (P < .02), and nifedipine exerted the opposite effect (P = .005). Multivariate analysis indicated that the probability of developing ischemia was strongly associated with heart rate variables and was unaffected by time of day.", 
    "24": "Most episodes of ambulatory ischemia are associated with a preceding period of increased heart rate. The likelihood of developing ischemia is predicted by heart rate variables and unaffected by time of day. Anti-ischemic efficacy is generally a result of the medication's efficacy in reducing heart rate variables. A minority of ischemic episodes are not associated with preceding periods of increased heart rate, may be caused by episodic coronary vasoconstriction, and are more effectively reduced by nifedipine than propranolol.",

New applications of the technique are being investigated in a wide variety of patients including those with advanced coronary artery disease. Despite its widespread use, the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography has not been sufficiently documented.", 
    "26": "A consecutive series of 1118 patients undergoing dobutamine stress echocardiography for evaluation of known or suspected coronary artery disease form the basis of this report. Dobutamine stress testing was performed for evaluation of chest pain, risk assessment before noncardiac surgery, after recent myocardial infarction, or as a part of ongoing research protocols. Over the study period, the maximal dose of dobutamine used was increased from 30 to 50 micrograms/kg per minute, and atropine was used in 420 (37%) patients. There were no occurrences of death, myocardial infarction, or episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia as a result of dobutamine stress testing. The major reasons for test termination were achievement of target heart rate in 583 patients (52.1%), maximum dose in 255 (22.8%), and angina pectoris in 142 (13%). The test was terminated in 36 (3%) patients because of noncardiac side effects including nausea, anxiety, headache, tremor, and urgency. Angina pectoris occurred in 216 (19.3%) patients. Sublingual nitroglycerin, a short-acting beta-blocker, or both types of medication were administered in 80 of these patients for relief of angina pectoris. None required intravenous nitroglycerin. A total of 736 (65%) patients had stable sinus rhythm throughout the test. The most common arrhythmias were frequent premature ventricular complexes (six or more per minute) in 172 patients (15%), and frequent premature atrial complexes in 86 (8%). There were 40 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. None had symptoms associated with the tachycardia, and only one received specific pharmacological treatment to prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia after the test was terminated. The patients who were evaluated after recent myocardial infarction and those who received atropine did not have a higher frequency of ventricular tachycardia compared with those without recent infarction and those not receiving atropine.", 
    "27": "Dobutamine stress echocardiography was safely performed using supplemental atropine and an aggressive dosing protocol. Noncardiac side effects were usually minor. Arrhythmias were well tolerated and rarely required treatment. In this study, serious complications from myocardial ischemia did not occur. Symptomatic ischemia was effectively treated with test termination, sublingual nitroglycerin, or short-acting beta-blockers.", 
    "28": "Pharmacology can contribute in four ways to our understanding and to the management of resistant depression: 1) Dosage: some antidepressants have an inverted-U dose-response curve, i.e. the response disappears when dosage is increased. In man, dose-response relationships are not well established because the curves are obtained with groups of patients and they reflect an overall mean rather than the reality of each individual patient. 2) Secondary regulatory adaptive mechanism such as: down regulation of beta, 5-HT2, alpha-2 receptors--increased reactivity of 5-HT1A, alpha-1 and dopaminergic systems. Defective development of these mechanisms is thought to originate resistance in certain cases, which could therefore be corrected more or less specifically by adding thyroid hormone, lithium, an alpha-2 agonist or even by switching to a 5-HT1A agonist or a dopaminergic drug. 3) Biological resistance factors: it has been shown in the rat that hypothyroidism, diabetes, weight loss cause a decrease in beta-adrenergic system reactivity, and therefore a resistance to noradrenergic antidepressants. 4) Co-prescription: the efficacy of noradrenergic antidepressants is known to involve the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Animal studies have shown that the co-prescription of a beta-blocker nullifies this efficacy. Benzodiazepines decrease serotonergic and noradrenergic neuronal activity: animal studies have shown that they antagonize most antidepressants. What happens in depressed humans who are often co-prescribed these drugs? I would like to share with you a few data from experimental pharmacology which may help us to think differently, not when faced to a patient with resistant depression, but when confronted with the failure of a well conducted antidepressant treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Adverse drug reaction in our study were less than those reported from Western countries. Better patient selection, optimal dose could have reduced the frequency of ADR in the present study. Racial factor and season might be operating to bring down ADR to atenolol in Indian patients.", 
    "31": "The safety and tolerability of intermittent (16 hours on/8 hours off) nitrate patch therapy (0.2, 0.4 or 0.6 mg/hr: dose adjusted as required) was studied for a median duration of 356 days in 106 patients (mean age 60.9 +/- 8.6 years) with angina pectoris. Most patients (82%) were on existing beta-blocker and/or calcium antagonist therapy. Safety, tolerability and efficacy data were obtained by means of patient diary cards and regular clinic visits. Almost 90 treatment years revealed no significant or serious adverse events, and there were no changes in haematology or biochemistry associated with intermittent nitrate patch therapy. The most frequently reported side-effects were headache, skin reactions and dizziness (53%, 20% and 8% of patients respectively). Treatment resulted in a sustained reduction in the frequency and severity of angina attacks, reduced sublingual GTN consumption, an improvement in general wellbeing and a rise in the proportion of patients in whom angina was controlled.", 
    "32": "Down syndrome has long been associated with a variety of autoimmune conditions. A significant link has also been described between Down syndrome and autoimmune thyroid disease, usually hypothyroidism. We report two cases of Down syndrome with Graves disease both with significantly elevated titres of thyrotropin receptor antibody and the presence of the HLA Bw46. We also comment on the problems in diagnosis and management of such patients.", 
    "33": "Myocardial infarction induced by coronary occlusion (O model) and reperfusion (R model) and the effects of nitroglycerin (Nit), propranolol (Pro), lidocaine (Lid), nifedipine (Nif), and saline were studied in rats by image analysis and weighing methods. The results showed that the myocardial infarct size (MIS) in R and O models were 27 +/- 8% and 39 +/- 6%, respectively (P < 0.01). The roundness and the distances from the border of the infarct zone (IZ) to endocardium or epicardium in R model were greater than those in O model, while the gray level difference between normal and infarct myocardium (delta G) in the R model was less than that in O model. MIS of Nit group in O and R models were 23 +/- 12% and 16 +/- 7%, respectively, which were significantly less than those in Lid, Nif groups, and saline. The reduction of MIS was also found in Pro group in both models. The results suggested that early restoration of blood flow resulted in the salvage of injured myocardium and Nit and Pro were found to have beneficial effects in both models.", 
    "34": "The positive chronotropic effect of alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes was studied on the isolated right atrium of adult male Wistar rats. In the presence of beta-blocker propranolol, chloroethylclonidine (Chl) (an irreversible alpha 1B inactivator) reduced the positive chronotropic effect of phenylephrine (Phe). When the basal rate was lowered by cholinergic stimulation. Chl showed less effect on the increase of spontaneous beat rate. H-7, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, lowered the chronotropic effect to Phe under physiological condition, but did not affect the Phe-induced positive chronotropic effect when basal rate was lessened by carbachol. These suggested that the chronotropic effect was mainly mediated by alpha 1B receptors, and partially related to the activation of PKC by second messengers under physiological conditions. The compensatory effect of the alpha 1-adrenoceptors was mainly mediated by alpha 1A receptors, which is scarcely involved in the activation of PKC.", 
    "35": "The beta-adrenoceptors of human pulmonary artery (PA) and thoracic aorta (TA) were studied by the use of a high specific activity radioligand [125I]pindolol (Pin). To identify the subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors in the 2 blood vessels, the competitive inhibition curves of [125I]Pin by beta 1-antagonist atenolol and beta 2-agonist salbutamol were analyzed using a computer program LIGAND of a mathematical model of the ligand-binding system. The Bmax (15.3 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein) and the dissociation constant Kd (44 +/- 4 pmol.L-1) for PA were similar to those for TA (Bmax, 12.8 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein, Kd, 45 +/- 4 pmol.L-1). Competitive inhibition analysis showed that the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor subtypes coexisted in human PA and TA, with beta 1 adrenoceptor dominant. The ratios of beta 1:beta 2 in PA and TA were 2.9:1.0 and 2.1:1.0, respectively.", 
    "36": "The secretory status of mast cells of mesentery and subcutaneous connective tissue was studied in rats using the morphometry analysis. Immobilization for 30 min has induced a 3.7-fold decrease of the heparin saturation index in these mast cells and a 3-fold increase of the granulolysis index. In rats preliminary given propranolol, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist (1.25 mg/kg), a stimulatory effect of immobilization was absent. Phentolamine, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist (6 mg/kg), partially inhibited the immobilization effect. Isoprenaline, beta-agonist (1.5 mg/kg), activated heparin secretion in rats without immobilization, while phenylephrine, alpha-agonist (2.5 mg/kg) had no effect on the secretory state of mast cells. Propranolol in the same dose also blocked the stimulatory action of i. v. injected alpha-thrombin (50 NIH/kg) on heparin secretion from mast cells of subcutaneous connective tissue. The obtained results show that catecholamines participate in activation of heparin release from mast cells induced both by the stress and by thrombin injection. Their action is mediated by beta-adrenoceptors of the vessel wall.", 
    "37": "The solubilization of multilamellar liposomes by metoprolol tartrate (MPL) has been studied as a function of pH, [MPL], [dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC)], temperature and lipid composition. The solubilization of liposomes at 37 degrees C by 7.3 nM MPL occurred at different rates at different pH values. MPL completely solubilized by 7.2 mM DMPC liposomes after about 17 h at pH 12, but only a partial solubilization occurred at pH 10 and 11. Between pH 7 and 9 no change in turbidity was observed after 1 week. Addition of cholesterol (CHOL) to DMPC (2:1 mol) had very little effect on solubilization after 24 h, however with DMPC:CHOL (5:1 mol) the decrease in turbidity was observed after 24 h, even though solubilization was much less compared with that of DMPC alone. The rate of solubilization was decreased when dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes were employed. Addition of dicetylphosphate (DCP) to DMPC liposomes reduced the rate of solubilization significantly. The solubilization of liposomes by 7.3 mM MPL as a function of [DMPC], indicated that the lower the liposome concentration the greater the effect on solubilization. It is concluded that MPL in the non-ionized form has a solubilizing effect on liposomes, and addition of CHOL or DCP to DMPC has a stabilizing effect against solubilization.", 
    "38": "1. The present study examined the effect of U-50,488H on auricular contraction of isolated left atria of the rat. 2. The negative inotropic action induced by the kappa-agonist was antagonized in the presence of propranolol (10(-8) or 5 x 10(-8) M), yohimbine (5 x 10(-7) or 10(-6) M) or in reserpinized rats (5 mg/kg i.p. 24 hr before the experiments). 3. These results suggest that catecholaminergic mechanisms are involved in the cardiac depressant effect induced by U-50,488H.", 
    "39": "The experiments with isolated rat atria isometrically contracting and those with simulated rat heart failure were performed to study the effects of the alpha-, beta-, and X-blocker cordarone on the pharmacodynamic effects of strophanthin. Cordarone was demonstrated to greatly decrease the toxicity of the cardiotonic in circulatory decompensation, without causing negative effects of cardiac inotropic function. Cordarone in combination with strophanthin slightly diminished the magnitude of the negative chronotropic effect of the cardiac glycoside and slowed down the rate of its cardiotonic effect.", 
    "40": "Electromagnetic flowmetry and analogue computer techniques were used in the experiments on 12 anesthesized cats which indicated that verapamil increased cardiac output (CO) (due to lower afterload) and venous return (VR), distributed CO, by improving brain blood supply. The latter was due to more marked decrease in the vascular resistance of the brachiocephalic artery than that in the descending thoracic aorta. Propranolol diminished CO due to higher afterload, lower VR and cardiac pump function. At the same time blood flow in the brachiocephalic artery decreased to a lesser extent than that in the descending thoracic aorta. The blood flow changes in the great arteries, which were induced by the drug determined its use in the vena cava.", 
    "41": "A peripheral neuropathy with hyperalgesia and allodynia was produced by loosely tying constrictive ligature around the left sciatic nerve of rats, i.v. injection of anisodamine 20 mg/Kg abolished both neuropathic hyperalgesia responses to noxious radiant heat and ectopic discharges generated from the injured region of the nerve. Anisodanime applied either systemically or locally to the damaged area of the nerve not only ceased the spontaneous ectopic discharges recorded from A beta to C fibers but also blocked the afferent ectopic discharge elicited by K+ channel blocker, noradrenaline, Ca2+ or antidromic stimulation of sciatic nerve proximal to the injured nerve area. The experiments indicated that anisodamine probably possessed a calcium channel blocker-like activity and produced selective block of the new channels in the injured area. It is suggested that anisodamine may be a candidate therapeutic agent in relieving hyperalgesia and allodynia following nerve injury.", 
    "42": "Multiple inotropic agents may be required to improve hypotension associated with beta-blocker toxicity. This study compared combined amrinone and glucagon therapy to glucagon alone and saline control for the treatment of propranolol-induced cardiovascular depression in a canine model. Six animals were pretreated with 10 mg/kg of propranolol intravenously (i.v.), which resulted in significant depression in heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and maximal left ventricular change in pressure over time (dP/dt max) (P < .0001). Each canine received i.v. amrinone (4 mg/kg) plus glucagon (20 micrograms/kg) therapy during a 2-minute period after propranolol infusion was completed. Cardiovascular parameters were monitored at 1, 6, 11, 21, and 31 minutes after treatment was rendered. Results were compared with those of a previous study, consisting of six animals that received glucagon therapy alone (20 mg/kg) and six controls (normal saline only) in an identical protocol. The addition of i.v. amrinone to glucagon therapy did not increase significantly, HR, CO, stroke volume, or dP/dt max compared with glucagon alone. Total systemic peripheral resistance was reduced significantly during 31 minutes of observation after the administration of combined therapy compared with the control; glucagon alone also reduced systemic peripheral resistance at 1 and 6 minutes. At all time periods except 1 minute of observation there was a significant reduction in MAP when comparing combined therapy with that of glucagon therapy alone. In this model, the addition of amrinone to glucagon therapy seems to have a detrimental effect on the ability of glucagon to increase MAP resulting from propranolol toxicity.", 
    "43": "The effects of metoprolol or streptokinase or the combination of both drugs on left ventricular function and the rescue of the jeopardized myocardium in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were compared. Thirty-seven patients with AMI were allocated in 3 different groups: 19 received 15 mg of metoprolol i.v. in 15 minutes, 7 were treated with 1.5 million IU i.v. of streptokinase and 11 more received both drugs. The following variables were studied at control and one and twenty-four hours after treatment; blood pressure, heart rate, \"double product\", systolic time intervals, diastolic time and the sum of ST-segment elevation and the sum of the R wave in the EKG. Blood pressure, heart rate and \"double product\" decreased in the groups treated with metoprolol. The pre-ejection time/ejection time index did not change in any group. The diastolic time increased with metoprolol and the sum of ST-segment elevation was more reduced with the combined treatment. Also in this group, the sum of R wave did not decrease as it happened in the other 2 groups. It is concluded that the combination of streptokinase and metoprolol was more effective in the rescue of jeopardized myocardium than metoprolol or streptokinase administered alone.", 
    "44": "After cutting the sciatic nerve in rats, clofelin and propranolol were tested for effects on the development of the pain syndrome. It was found that in rats receiving neither clofelin nor propranolol, the cutting of the sciatic nerve resulted in hyperalgesia, autotomies, increased amplitude of evoked potentials in the contralateral somatosensory cortex during tissue stimulation of the paw with the nerve cut, as well as in impaired microcirculation and venular permeability in mesenteric vessels. A daily administration of clofelin or propranolol to the animals starting on the first day after nerve cutting was demonstrated to prevent disorders existing in control animals. The mechanisms of action of clofelin and propranolol which prevent the pain syndrome in the animals after the cutting of the sciatic nerve are discussed.", 
    "45": "1. The possible role of autonomic neurotransmitters in atrial natriuretic peptide secretion was investigated using spontaneously beating guinea-pig atria in vitro. Dose responses were determined for adrenaline, noradrenaline and acetylcholine and the selective alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor agonists phenylephrine and isoprenaline, respectively. Adrenoceptor effects were further studied using the selective alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin and propranolol, respectively, in conjunction with maximal adrenaline challenge. Results for rate and force of contraction and atrial natriuretic peptide secretion are expressed as a ratio (mean +/- SEM) of a 15 min treatment period (stage 2) to a corresponding pretreatment period (stage 1). 2. Adrenaline and noradrenaline caused dose-dependent increases in the rate and force of contraction and in atrial natriuretic peptide secretion with a peak secretory response at 2 x 10(-6) mol/l of 1.54 +/- 0.08 (P < 0.01) and 1.34 +/- 0.08 (P < 0.01) for adrenaline and noradrenaline, respectively. Acetylcholine decreased the rate and force of contraction, and ANP secretion was reduced to 0.47 +/- 0.06 at 3 x 10(-5) mol/l (P < 0.01). Isoprenaline increased the rate and force of contraction and atrial natriuretic peptide secretion with a peak secretory response of 1.52 +/- 0.22 at 2 x 10(-6) mol/l (P < 0.01). Phenylephrine increased the force but had no effect on the rate of contraction, and stimulated atrial natriuretic peptide secretion to 1.13 +/- 0.09 at 2 x 10(-5) mol/l (P < 0.05). After both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade, adrenaline was still able to significantly stimulate atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and positive inotropy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Changes were examined in myocardial catecholamine content and alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors during the development of cardiomyopathy in Syrian hamsters (Bio 14.6) and age-matched healthy controls. In addition, the effects of bunazosin, atenolol, xamoterol, ketanserin, and verapamil on the catecholamine content and [3H]prazosin, [3H]CGP12177 bindings to alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors of myocardium were compared with those of the controls. (1) Lower norepinephrine and dopamine levels were observed in 35-week-old cardiomyopathic hamster hearts than in the controls. There was, however, a tendency for a slight decrease of alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenoceptors in cardiomyopathic hamsters. (2) Administration of bunazosin induced lower dopamine values in 18-week-old cardiomyopathic hamsters. (3) Xamoterol induced a higher Kd value for beta 1-adrenoceptors and lower dopamine content than for those with cardiomyopathy. Ketanserin also induced a higher Bmax value than for cardiomyopathy. Thus, drug treatments clearly change catecholamine content and binding characteristics of the adrenoceptors which play an important role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.", 
    "47": "To test whether beta-adrenergic mechanisms and the sympathetic nervous system are involved in the synergistic action of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and cortisol on lung maturation, fetal sheep (n = 32) were infused from 121 to 128 days of gestation with saline, TRH + cortisol, TRH + cortisol + beta-adrenergic blocker, or TRH + cortisol after chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine. TRH + cortisol increased lung distensibility and stability and alveolar concentrations of saturated phosphatidylcholine two- to threefold over control fetuses. beta-Adrenergic blockade prevented the increase in distensibility in response to TRH + cortisol. Sympathectomy did not impair the increase in distensibility and stability in response to TRH + cortisol but inhibited the increase in alveolar total phospholipids. Tissue concentrations of saturated phosphatidylcholine increased in TRH + cortisol-treated fetuses after either sympathectomy or beta-adrenergic blockade. We concluded that during lung maturation by TRH + cortisol 1) sympathetic mechanisms are requisite for surfactant release, 2) nonneurogenic beta-adrenergic mechanisms are requisite for the maturation of the mechanical properties of the lung and 3) stimulation of surfactant synthesis is independent of beta-adrenergic action and the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "48": "Plasma kinetics and beta-receptor blocking and -binding activity of timolol was studied in six healthy volunteers following its intravenous 0.25 mg dose. Timolol concentrations were measured using radioreceptor assay (RRA), blocking activity by comparing the dose ratios (DRs) of the infusion rates of isoprenaline required to increase heart rate by 25 bpm (I25) and binding activity by determining the extent to which timolol occupied beta 1-receptors of rabbit lung and beta 2-receptors of rat reticulocytes in undiluted plasma samples. Timolol was eliminated from plasma with a mean half-life for the elimination phase of 2.6 hours. The dose antagonized potently isoprenaline-induced tachycardia at least for four hours. The effect was excellently correlated with the estimated beta 2-receptor binding activity of timolol in the circulating plasma. In conclusion, the small intravenous timolol dose was eliminated from plasma by a fashion, which was very similar to its eighty-fold higher oral doses reported earlier in the literature. The 0.25 mg dose was of considerable systemic beta-receptor blocking and -binding activity, that may help to explain its reported side-effects following ocular drug administration. The extent to which beta-blocking agents occupy rabbit lung beta 1- and rat reticulocyte beta 2-receptors in the circulation appears to predict the intensity and selectivity of their beta-blocking effects in healthy volunteers.", 
    "49": "Individuals with hypertension and electrocardiographic (ECG) evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have a 10-fold greater risk of developing cardiac failure than hypertensives without ECG evidence of LVH. LVH in hypertension is characterized by myocardial fibrosis and structural changes to the small intramural arteries. Hypertensives with or without LVH have reduced coronary vasodilator reserve due to hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries. Prognosis of arterial hypertension is largely determined by cardiac complications. The aim of treatment of hypertensive heart disease is to reverse myocardial hypertrophy in order to prevent progression to hypertensive heart failure, as well as reversal of the hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries in order to improve coronary reserve. On the development of hypertensive heart failure, administration of digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be initiated. Although regression of LVH can be induced by dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and sympatholytic substances, clinical evidence of the reversal of hypertensive disease of small coronary arteries has still to be established.", 
    "50": "1. Recent evidence suggests that the novel compound SDZ 216-525 is a selective and possibly silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Here we have examined the action of SDZ 216-525 on central 5-HT1A autoreceptor function. The experiments involved measurement of drug effects on extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus of the chloral hydrate anaesthetized rat by use of microdialysis. 2. Acute injection of SDZ 216-525 (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3 mg kg-1, s.c.) caused a dose-related decrease in 5-HT output with an estimated ED50 of at least 0.3 mg kg-1. This ED50 value is 20-30 times greater than ED50 values previously obtained for 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and NAN-190. In comparison, SDZ 216-525 is reported to have slightly higher affinity for the 5-HT1A site than 8-OH-DPAT and NAN-190. 3. The inhibitory effect of SDZ 216-525 (1 mg kg-1, s.c.) on 5-HT was blocked by the 5-HT1/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, (-)-pindolol (8 mg kg-1, s.c.) but not by a combination of the beta 1- and beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonists metoprolol and ICI 118,551 (4 mg kg-1, each). 4. Although in several experimental models SDZ 216-525 has high affinity, selectivity and lacks intrinsic activity at the 5-HT1A receptor, our experiments show that the drug decreases extracellular 5-HT in ventral hippocampus of the chloral hydrate anaesthetized rat via a pindolol-sensitive mechanism. We conclude that either SDZ 216-525 promotes (with low potency in vivo) 5-HT1A receptor/G-protein interactions, or that the 5-HTlA autoreceptor is a 5-HT1A receptor subtype different from the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor.", 
    "51": "The left ventricle hypertrophies in response to chronic pressure overload. To determine whether increased beta-adrenergic stimulation, wall mass, intrinsic contractility, or a combination of these factors is responsible for improved left ventricular (LV) pump function during early development of pressure-overload hypertrophy and whether hypertrophy normalizes peak-systolic wall stress, as is commonly believed, we induced pressure overload in intact-chest dogs by gradual constriction of one renal artery and implanted radiopaque markers, via a catheter, in the LV endocardium to measure dimensions. Changes in hemodynamics, LV dimensions, contractility indexes, and circumferential wall stress were measured before and after acute beta-blockade for 12 wk. LV function improved over time in the unblocked state, indicated by increased cardiac output, systolic pressures, stroke work, and maximal elastance (Emax). Acute beta-blockade reduced stroke work, Emax, and maximal LV rate of pressure over time (dP/dtmax) relative to the unblocked state but all still increased significantly over time. dP/dtmax and Emax did not vary with increases in LV mass, but stroke work was borderline dependent on LV mass. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic stimulation contributes to improved LV pump function and that the remaining improvements are due to both increased intrinsic contractility and wall mass. In contrast to accepted theory, LV systolic wall stresses decreased significantly over time. End-diastolic wall stress increased after renal artery constriction, then returned to baseline values as the heart hypertrophied. These results suggest that hypertrophy normalizes end-diastolic, not peak-systolic, wall stress.", 
    "52": "We previously reported that Asn312 of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and Asn385 in the homologous position in the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor are important for binding to a class of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists including propranolol and alprenolol. We proposed that the asparagine may be forming a hydrogen bond with the phenoxy oxygen common to these ligands. To further test this hypothesis we made alanine, threonine, phenylalanine, and glutamine substitutions at position 312 in the beta 2-adrenergic receptor. We observed that substitution with amino acids that permit formation of hydrogen bonds (threonine and glutamine) supported binding to aryloxyalkylamines, whereas substitution with amino acids that cannot form hydrogen bonds (alanine and phenylalanine) did not permit binding to these compounds. We were surprised to find that two of these substitutions led to an increase in affinity for alpha-adrenergic ligands. Substitution with glutamine and threonine at position 312 led to a 11-15-fold increase in affinity for yohimbine and enabled p-aminoclonidine to act as an agonist. These results further emphasize the role of position 312 in the formation of the ligand binding site for multiple ligands.", 
    "53": "To study the involvement of the adrenergic system in nickel-induced hyperglycemia and hepatic glutathione depletion in rats, several adrenergic antagonists (phentolamine, prazosin, yohimbine, and propranolol) were administered in a single ip injection before acute nickel treatment (ip injection). Moreover, the effects of nickel on adrenalectomized rats were investigated. Hyperglycemia was suppressed by either alpha-antagonist phentolamine or alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. Such blockade coincided with the prevention of the hypoinsulinemic response to nickel, which occurred simultaneously to hyperglycemia. Nickel-induced hyperglucagonemia remained almost unaltered by pretreatment with adrenergic antagonists. In adrenalectomized animals treated with nickel, hyperglycemia was attenuated, whereas hypoinsulinemia still persisted. Therefore, catecholamines seemed to participate in nickel-induced hyperglycemia, directly, i.e., stimulating glucose output from liver, or by modulating insulin secretion throughout alpha 2-adrenoreceptor stimulation in pancreatic islets. Hepatic glutathione depletion caused by nickel was prevented by either alpha 1-antagonist prazosin or alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. Interestingly, adrenalectomy did not alter the drop in hepatic GSH induced by nickel treatment. Overall results suggest that the effects observed after acute nickel exposure were caused by a combined action of catecholamines released from the adrenal glands and those released at the efferent nerves. Such events have been found to be mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "54": "Effects of chronic treatment with bevantolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, and of repeated immobilization stress on blood pressure, body weight, and [3H]dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding to the cerebral cortex were examined in rats. Systolic blood pressure increased to approximately 150 mmHg when stress was applied for 14 days (2 h day-1). This increase was inhibited by chronic treatment with bevantolol (250 mg kg-1 daily). However, bevantolol did not suppress the inhibition of body weight gain by stress. The maximum number of [3H]DHA binding sites (Bmax) in the cerebral cortex was decreased by stress without changing the affinity, and the decrease in Bmax mainly reflected the reduction of beta 1-adrenoceptors. Bevantolol treatment (250 mg kg-1) increased the Bmax to 137% and completely inhibited the downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors by stress. These results show that bevantolol can inhibit both the hypertension and downregulation of the central beta 1-adrenoceptors induced by stress.", 
    "55": "Isoproterenol (ISO)-induced relaxation of oxytocin-induced Ca(++)-independent contraction of the rat uterus was examined. Oxytocin induced Ca(++)-dependent phasic contraction in a solution containing Ca++ (normal contraction) and Ca(++)-independent sustained contraction in Ca(++)-free solution (Ca(++)-free contraction). Both contractions were completely suppressed by cyclic AMP-elevating relaxants such as ISO, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin. Moreover, the ISO concentration needed to inhibit the Ca(++)-free contraction was lower than that needed for normal contraction, although the relaxing effect of dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin during Ca(++)-free contraction was not significantly different from that during Ca(++)-dependent contraction. The ISO-induced relaxation of the uterus in Ca(++)-free solution may involve three mechanisms. The first is cyclic AMP-dependent relaxation shown by high concentrations (more than 1 nM) of ISO. The second is stabilization via K+ channels by intermediate concentrations (10 pM to 1 nM) of ISO. These two actions appear to be mediated through beta-1 adrenoceptors. The third is, however, via an unknown subtype of adrenoceptor stimulated by extremely low concentrations (1 pM to 10 pM) of ISO. All of these relaxing mechanisms are independent of Ca++.", 
    "56": "The existence of beta 3-adrenoceptors in adipose tissue and their involvement in the control of lipolysis was investigated in dog. Selective beta 3-adrenergic agonists (BRL 37344, SR 58611A and CGP 12177) and catecholamines (isoproterenol and norepinephrine) activated lipolysis in isolated adipocytes (order of potency: isoproterenol > BRL 37344 > norepinephrine > CGP 12177 > SR 58611A). The lipolytic effect of 0.05 microM BRL 37344 was antagonized by the nonselective beta-AR antagonists, but the selective beta 1-(CGP 20712A) and beta 2-(ICI 118551) antagonists were ineffective. Infused to conscious dogs, beta 3-adrenergic agonists increased plasma nonesterified fatty acids levels with an order of potency equivalent to that defined in lipolysis. The lipomobilizing effect induced by the administration of an alpha 2-antagonist (0.01 mg/kg RX 821002 i.v.) was suppressed by bupranolol (0.5 mg/kg) or the combination of CGP 20712A and ICI 118551 (0.25 mg/kg each). The effect of 0.05 mg/kg RX 821002 was only partially suppressed by the same beta-antagonist combination, whereas bupranolol totally abolished it. At 0.5 mg/kg, the RX 821002 effect was not modified by beta-antagonists. The lipomobilization due to infusion of catecholamines (0.1, 0.5 or 5 micrograms/kg/min norepinephrine or 5 micrograms/kg/min epinephrine) was always suppressed by bupranolol or the combination of selective beta-antagonists. Thus dog adipocytes express functional beta 3-ARs. Their stimulation induces lipid mobilization. The lipomobilization of exogenously administered catecholamines is due only to the recruitment of beta 1- or beta 2-ARs. However, endogenous catecholamines released after sympathetic nervous system activation could stimulate beta 3-ARs in adipocytes only if a high level of sympathetic nervous system activity is realized.", 
    "57": "Aged adults are particularly susceptible to cardiac disease, with a high incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and MI-related mortality. How to treat them is not completely understood, because the major therapeutic trials for MI have studied predominantly younger adults. Moreover, these trials have tended to exclude women and patients with comorbidities, characteristics that are more typical of older cardiac patients. Therefore, whether these trials can be applied to our aged MI patients is unclear. This review analyzes data from earlier trials to better delineate their implications for the elderly MI patients that we frequently treat.", 
    "58": "The pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia traditionally has been attributed to disturbances of oxygen demand, as observed in classic effort-induced angina pectoris, or to a primary disruption of coronary blood supply, as in unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. Laboratory research eliciting various types of perfusion-contraction matching has challenged such a historical distinction between supply and demand-induced determinants of myocardial ischemia. A growing number of clinical studies analyzing the role of heart rate in the course of coronary heart disease suggest the possibility that a common perfusion-contraction scheme may underlie these diverse clinical manifestations. During experimental myocardial ischemia, produced by a low coronary blood flow, regional perfusion-contraction matching exists in which the energy demands and regional contraction are reduced to match the diminished myocardial substrate supply. Heart rate is a major factor influencing transmural blood flow distribution and regional function, because when coronary vasodilation is maximal there is an inverse relation between the level of heart rate and subendocardial perfusion. Thus, in experimental regional ischemia, increasing heart rate reduces subendocardial flow and contraction, whereas slowing of heart rate causes improvement of contraction associated with increased subendocardial blood flow, accompanied by a decrease in outer wall blood flow. Also, \"interventricular steal\" of blood from the left ventricle by the right ventricle during ischemia can be reversed by slowing the heart rate in the presence of regional ischemia. Improvement of contraction by heart rate slowing is more than would be expected on the basis of the increase in subendocardial perfusion alone, reflecting a combination of decreased oxygen demand and increased oxygen supply, and separate curves relating blood flow per minute to contractile function are observed at different heart rates. However, when perfusion is normalized for heart rate by expressing subendocardial blood flow in units per beat, a single relation is observed at different heart rates. This observation supports the concept of a close coupling between subendocardial blood flow per beat and regional performance, or perfusion-contraction matching, during various levels of ischemia. Based on these principles, it can be predicted that exercise-induced regional ischemia in the presence of coronary stenosis will be attenuated by several mechanisms when heart rate is slowed using either a beta-blocking agent, or a specific bradycardic drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "60": "Beta-blockers are frequently used in the treatment of hypertension. However their long term use has been associated with an increase of serum triglycerides and a decrease of HLD-cholesterol concentrations which could diminish the benefit drawn from their hypotensive effect. The effect on lipid metabolism is less unfavourable when beta-blockers exert an intrinsic sympathomimetic activity or are said to be cardioselective. Mechanisms involved are complex and poorly understood.", 
    "61": "The anti-ischemic properties of beta-blocking drugs have promoted their use during acute myocardial infarction. Beneficial effects are only observed with very early intravenous administration (less than 6 hours). Mortality is reduced by 14% and reinfarction by 18% during the 8 day post-infarction period. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation has been inconstantly decreased. Infarct size reduction is the most probable mechanism of beta-blockade induced protection. The thrombolytic-beta-blocker association seems to provide additional benefits compared with thrombolysis alone, but this remains to be demonstrated in large scale trials.", 
    "62": "Possession of beta-1-selectivity and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) by beta-adrenergic blocking drugs have been found to modify the effects of these drugs on heart rate, blood pressure and pulmonary airway resistance both at rest and during exercise. In a randomised, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial, 21 healthy male volunteers took placebo, propranolol (non-selective with no ISA), metoprolol (beta-1-selective with no ISA) and pindolol (non-selective with ISA) on separate occasions prior to an exercise test using the same protocol each time. Heart rate, blood pressure and peak respiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured before exercise and at exhaustion. No significant differences in percentage increase in heart rate after exercise were detected between placebo and all the three beta-blockers. All three drugs were associated with significantly lower percentage increases in systolic blood pressure with exercise compared to placebo; with metoprolol and propranolol causing lower increases than pindolol. The index of myocardial oxygen consumption, MVO2, was highest with pindolol. PEFR was reduced most by propranolol. Possession of beta-1-selectivity and ISA by beta-blocking drugs modifies their effects on cardio-respiratory responses to exercise amongst indigenous Kenyans.", 
    "63": "Beta-blockers that are non-selective, beta-1-selective or possess intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) are thought to differ in their effects on serum potassium, glucose and lactate during exercise. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled study, 21 healthy male volunteers took placebo, propranolol, pindolol and metoprolol on separate occasions. They were subsequently exercised using the same exercise protocol on each visit and serum levels of potassium, glucose and lactate determined before and after exercise. Only propranolol (non-selective beta-blocker with no ISA) was associated with significantly higher increases in serum potassium and glucose than placebo (p = 0.000). Increases in serum lactate levels with exercise were not significantly different between propranolol, pindolol (non selective blockers with ISA), metoprolol (beta-1-selective blocker with ISA) and placebo. Interference with metabolic responses to exercise associated with beta-blockade is modified by beta-1-selectivity and ISA amongst indigenous Kenyans.",

Stimulating effect of propranolol from the 9th to the 19th day of incubation and inhibitory effect of cyproheptadine from the 5th to the 19th day of incubation were revealed. These results indicate the existence of serotonin and noradrenaline in the amniotic fluid of chick embryo. High performance liquid chromatography directly confirmed this conclusion.", 
    "65": "The LDH cytotoxicity test is able to emphasize the stabilisation of human embryo fibroblast membranes, in vitro, by two amphiphilic drugs: the metomidate and the thymolol. The membrane stabilisation is emphasized by the reduced LDH externalization as compared with the untreated cells. The use of the LDH test for the selection of some natural complexes or synthetic drugs with membrane stabilising and potential antiviral activity is proposed. The inhibition of LDH by metomidate was recorded, as decreasing of the enzyme activity with increasing metomidate concentration. This fact explains the known lactic acid accumulation, under metomidate treatment of human subjects. The use of metomidate in classical cancer treatment potentiation is proposed instead of lactate externalization inhibitors, already used for this aim.", 
    "66": "A method is reported in which the isolated bovine eye is perfused through a long posterior ciliary artery with buffered physiological saline, to provide simultaneous monitoring of drug effects on intraocular pressure (IOP), vascular resistance and the condition of the blood-aqueous barrier. With perfusion under constant pressure of 45 mm Hg, perfusate flows at 1.64 +/- 0.12 ml.min-1 (mean +/- SEM) and IOP is 7.26 +/- 0.16 mm Hg. Applying a constant flow rate of 2.25 ml.min-1, IOP averages 10.19 +/- 0.32 mm Hg and in both cases this can be maintained for around 2h. Increasing the perfusion flow rate from 1.5 to 3.5 ml.min-1 produces a 76% rise in perfusion pressure but IOP increases only insignificantly (< 10%). The inclusion in the perfusion fluid of dextran and albumin to maintain oncotic pressure similar to that of plasma makes no difference to the IOP achieved and does not affect the leakiness of the barrier. The preparation shows a net consumption of oxygen, supporting the hypothesis that the aqueous humour formed is secreted by active transport processes. Timolol (in bolus doses of 1-300 nmol) injected into the perfusing fluid is shown to induce a dose-dependent fall in IOP within 5 min, reaching a steady state within 40 min. Timolol, however, causes no significant change in vascular resistance, whether this is measured as perfusion flow rate under constant pressure or as perfusion pressure at constant flow rate, nor does it alter the permeability of the barrier. Other beta-blockers such as oxprenolol and betaxolol also induce dose-dependent decreases in IOP. By applying a fluorescein dilution technique, it is found that the aqueous formation rate (K(out) = 0.0046 min-1, or 12.9 microliters.min-1) is also reduced by timolol and, in a dose-dependent manner, by the new carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, MK-927. The bovine perfused eye offers a useful method for studying the mechanisms of action of drugs on IOP and aqueous humour formation, in isolation from the complicating influences of the CNS and the cardiovascular system and without the necessity to kill animals for experimental purposes.", 
    "67": "We examined the effect of neuropeptide Y (NPY) on neurogenic airway microvascular leakage. Male Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs (250-350 g) were anesthetized with urethan (2 g/kg ip). The cervical artery and vein were cannulated for monitoring blood pressure and injecting drugs, respectively. Atropine and propranolol (each 1 mg/kg i.v.) were administered 30 min before the experiment. After pretreatment with saline (vehicle for NPY) or NPY (1-100 micrograms/kg i.v.), Evans blue dye (30 mg/kg iv) was administered. Then, bilateral vagal nerves were electrically stimulated (5 V, 7 Hz, 5-ms duration for 3 min) to induce airway plasma leakage. Airways were divided into four sections [trachea (Tr), main bronchi, central intrapulmonary airways (IPA), and peripheral IPA] and incubated in formamide (37 degrees C for 16 h). The concentration of Evans blue dye was measured by spectrophotometer. Furthermore, we examined the effect of NPY on exogenous substance P- (0.3 microgram/kg i.v.) induced plasma extravasation. Bilateral vagal stimulation significantly increased leakage of dye in Tr to peripheral IPA. NPY did not affect basal leakage but did significantly inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation in a dose-dependent manner with maximal inhibitions of 42.3 (Tr), 67.7 (main bronchi), 38.2 (central IPA), and 26.3% (peripheral IPA) at 30 micrograms/kg. Exogenous substance P-induced plasma extravasation was not inhibited by NPY. We conclude that NPY inhibits neurogenic inflammation by prejunctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from airway sensory nerve terminals.", 
    "68": "The effects of beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers on cardiopulmonary response during exercise are not well characterized. Sixteen sedentary patients with essential hypertension underwent a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study comparing atenolol and diltiazem sustained-release 300 mg, each administered during 6 weeks, after a 15-day run-in placebo period. Neither atenolol nor diltiazem significantly affected maximal exercise duration, maximal oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold, or any of the ventilatory parameters during exercise. With atenolol, the maximal oxygen pulse was significantly increased and compensated for the decrease in heart rate during exercise. Atenolol and diltiazem do not limit maximal exercise tolerance in untrained hypertensive subjects, but the circulatory profile is more preserved with diltiazem.", 
    "69": "The effects of celiprolol (1 mg/kg), a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity (PAA), on large and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated and compared with those of atenolol (1 mg/kg) and saline at rest and during three levels of treadmill exercise in the same 7 conscious dogs. Control exercise after saline administration induced increases in heart rate (HR 131 +/- 4%), left ventricular (LVdP/dt 117 +/- 5%), coronary blood flow (CBF 133 +/- 13%), and circumflex artery diameter (CxAD, 6.6 +/- 1.3%) and a decrease in coronary vascular resistance (CVR, -47 +/- 3%). Atenolol decreased LVdP/dt (-19 +/- 2%) and CxAD (-3.2 +/- 0.3%, p < 0.05) at rest, but large epicardial coronary arteries remained constricted during exercise (-4.7 +/- 1.4% at 12 km/h, p < 0.05) despite simultaneous dilation of coronary resistance vessels. In contrast to atenolol, celiprolol did not constrict large coronary arteries at rest (CxAD -0.2 +/- 0.9%, NS), and this beneficial effect of celiprolol was maintained throughout the exercise period. LVdP/dt was not modified and HR was slightly increased (14.3 +/- 2.6%) at rest by celiprolol. Atenolol and celiprolol reduced the exercise-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, atenolol being the most potent. Thus, in dogs at rest when basal sympathetic tone was low, celiprolol, most likely because of its PAA, induced slight cardiac stimulation and prevented vasoconstriction of the large coronary arteries usually observed after beta-adrenoceptor blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "1. Neuromuscular transmission in the circular muscle of the canine proximal colon was examined, in the presence and absence of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, by use of mechanical and intracellular microelectrode recording techniques. 2. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; 0.1-20 HZ) produced frequency-dependent contractions of circular muscle strips which reached a maximum at 15 Hz. These responses were enhanced by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; 300 microM) and reduced by atropine (1 microM). The effects of L-NMMA were reversed by L-arginine (3 mM). All responses to EFS were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). 3. In the presence of atropine, phentolamine and propranolol (all at 1 microM; 'non-adrenergic, non-cholingergic (NANC) conditions'), EFS evoked frequency-dependent inhibition of phasic contractions which reached a maximum at 5 Hz. At higher frequencies of EFS, inhibition diminished, and these responses were followed by post-stimulus excitation. 4. Under NANC conditions and in the presence of L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 200 microM), EFS evoked contractions at frequencies of 5 Hz or greater. These contractions were reduced by co-incubation with L-arginine (2 mM) and abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). 5. In the presence of atropine (1 microM), EFS (5-20 Hz) caused frequency-dependent inhibition of electrical slow waves. In the presence of L-NAME (100 microM) and atropine, the inhibitory response to EFS was abolished and an increase in slow wave duration was seen at stimulation frequencies greater than 5 Hz. The effects of EFS on slow wave duration were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM). 6. Atropine-resistant contractions to EFS were enhanced by indomethacin (10 microM) and reduced or abolished by the non-selective NK1/NK2 tachykinin receptor antagonist D-Pro2, D-Trp7,9 SP, and by the selective NK2 receptor antagonist MEN 10,376 (10 microM).7. Exogenous tachykinins mimicked non-cholinergic excitatory electrical and mechanical responses. The rank order of potency for contraction was neurokinin A>neurokinin B>substance P, suggesting a predominance of the NK2 sub-type of tachykinin receptors on colonic smooth muscle cells. Low concentrations of neurokinin A also increased the amplitude and duration of electrical slow waves.8. These results suggest that: (i) in previous studies, non-cholinergic excitatory responses were masked by the simultaneous release of NO; (ii) non-cholinergic excitatory responses occur throughout the period of stimulation and are not manifest only as 'rebound' excitation; (iii) one or more tachykinins, possibly,acting via NK2 receptors, may mediate non-cholinergic excitatory responses.", 
    "71": "The ability to terminate supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) acutely with an oral dose of flecainide (2.5-3.3 mg/kg), sotalol (2.0-2.9 mg/kg), and verapamil (3.3-3.7 mg/kg) was investigated in an observational study of six patients with SVT normally controlled by an antitachycardia pacemaker. The pacemaker was programmed to induce SVT and the stability of SVT was observed for 90 minutes as a baseline. Subsequent studies involved testing of the three antiarrhythmic drugs on separate occasions, given in random order as crushed tablets in orange juice during pacemaker induced SVT, with plasma drug levels collected every 15 minutes for 90 minutes post drug ingestion. Sotalol produced drug induced slowing of SVT in all six patients, with termination of SVT in three patients by 60-65 minutes, with maximum plasma levels of 0.76-2.09 micrograms/mL achieved by 90 minutes. Flecainide produced maximum plasma levels of 83-745 ng/mL, 60-90 minutes post ingestion, and slowed SVT in three patients. SVT was terminated in three patients after 45-85 minutes, but no effect on SVT was seen in two patients who had inadequate plasma levels (< or = 166 ng/mL) from doses < 3 mg/kg. Verapamil produced maximum plasma levels of 0 (undetectable) to 388 ng/mL, 45-90 minutes post ingestion, and slowed SVT in three patients, but only one of these patients reverted to sinus rhythm (at 40 min). No effect on SVT was seen in three patients due to undetectable plasma levels. We concluded that sotalol (> or = 2 mg/kg) and flecainide (> or = 3 mg/kg) appeared to be suitable oral drugs for termination of SVT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "72": "In Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)-transformed NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing pp60v-src as tyrosine protein kinase, isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation was much lower than in normal cells. The reduction in v-src-transformed cells seemed to be mainly due to a decrease in the number of beta 2-adrenoceptors. When the membranes were phosphorylated with ATP, however, the binding affinity of isoproterenol to beta 2-adrenoceptors was reduced in transformed cell membranes by 34% compared to that in normal cell membranes. The reduction in transformed cell membranes was restored to the level of normal cell membranes by treatment of membranes with anti-pp60v-src antibody. GTP gamma S- and cholera toxin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were reduced with no change in forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in transformed cell membranes. The reduced effect of GTP gamma S was also restored by treatment with anti-pp60v-src antibody or by adding staurosporine, which inhibits a variety of protein kinases, including tyrosine protein kinase. One of the 32P-phosphoproteins phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP in v-src-transformed cell membranes was bound to GTP-agarose, and was a 46-kDa molecule on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. This 46-kDa 32P-labeled phosphoprotein was immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-stimulatory GTP-binding protein (anti-Gs) antibody. These results suggest that pp60v-src phosphorylates the alpha-subunit of Gs and consequently causes a decrease in the coupling of beta 2-receptors to Gs and in the coupling of Gs to adenylyl cyclase.",

    "74": "In 102 patients with high-grade coronary stenosis admitted for elective PTCA, preprocedural platelet activation was characterized by flow cytometric measurement of the proteins CD62, CD63, and thrombospondin expressed on the platelet surface membrane. The prevalence of acute ischemic events during the 24 hours immediately after the procedure was then related to the pre-PTCA platelet activation status. Fifty-six patients were classified as \"nonactivated,\" whereas 46 patients showed an increased percentage of activated platelets. Two patients developed acute occlusion (1.96%) and four patients high-grade restenosis (3.92%), as confirmed by second-look coronary angiography. All events occurred in patients classified as \"activated\" (six of 46, or 13%). None of these patients received beta-blocker medication, which was associated with lower expression of platelet membrane activation markers. In the nonactivated patient group, no clinical events were found (0 of 56, or 0%). This difference in prevalence is significant (p = 0.007).",

    "76": "In a prospective randomized study, the effects of the calcium entry blocker verapamil on shock wave induced tubular impairment were examined. A total of 24 patients with renal pelvis or caliceal stones undergoing anesthesia-free extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) without auxiliary measures was randomly assigned to the verapamil group (12) or the control group (12). Four doses of verapamil (80 mg. each) were given orally starting the night before ESWL. Controls received no medication. To assess renal tubular function the urinary excretion of alpha 1-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and Tamm-Horsfall protein were determined before, immediately, and 12 and 24 hours after ESWL. After ESWL there was an increase in urinary alpha 1-microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, which was significantly higher in the control than in the verapamil group. Tamm-Horsfall protein, a glycoprotein synthesized by the distal tubules, decreased significantly less in the verapamil group compared to the controls. Our results indicate that verapamil exhibits a protective effect on shock wave induced tubular damage. The underlying mechanisms are not elucidated yet, and direct actions on tubular cells and interference with renal hemodynamics are to be discussed.", 
    "77": "Starting from the observation that an increase of stress analgesia is followed by a hyperalgesia period, with a series of symptoms characteristic of the exogenous opioid abstinence syndrome (EXOAS), the authors supposed also the possibility of the existence of an endogenous abstinence syndrome (ENOAS). In order to demonstrate the existence of this syndrome, they investigated at first the possibility of the appearance of an acute tolerance to opioids. Then they followed-up the course of behaviour during and after informational stress in untreated animals, in animals treated with naloxone, which--being an antagonist of opioids--can induce EXOAS in toxicomaniacs, and in animals treated with clonidine and propranolol, that are used in the treatment of EXOAS. Experimental researches have demonstrated the possibility of ENOAS occurrence, its aggravation by naloxone and its improvement with clonidine and propranolol.", 
    "78": "We examined the effects of subchronic (4 days) administration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine and zimelidine and the noradrenaline-uptake inhibitor, desipramine, on isoprenaline-induced water drinking in rats treated with ethanol. These rats demonstrated significant increases in water drinking as compared to control rats that had received only i.p. injections of distilled water (P < 0.01). Administration of fluoxetine (5-20 mg/kg daily i.p., for 4 days) dose-dependently decreased water intake as compared to that of rats treated with ethanol only. In contrast, fluvoxamine, zimelidine (10 mg/kg i.p.) and desipramine (5 mg/kg i.p.) produced no significant effects on water intake. Pretreatment of animals with spiperone, methysergide, ritanserin, zacopride and BRL 43694A, together with fluoxetine, failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of the latter on isoprenaline-stimulated water intake. The results of the present study indicate that the action of fluoxetine on isoprenaline-stimulated water drinking in ethanol-treated rats may be mediated by an action on beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "79": "The effects of (R)alpha-methylhistamine and N alpha-methylhistamine on intestinal transit were examined in mice. The passage of a charcoal meal in the gastrointestinal tract was dose dependently inhibited by N alpha-methylhistamine (1-20 mg/kg i.p.), but not by a selective H3 receptor agonist (R)alpha-methyl-histamine (1-50 mg/kg i.p.). The inhibitory effect of N alpha-methylhistamine (20 mg/kg) was attenuated by pretreatment with H1 receptor antagonists (mepyramine 5 mg/kg i.p. or 5 micrograms i.c.v. and triprolidine 5 mg/kg i.p.), but not by cimetidine (10 mg/kg i.p.), zolantidine (5 mg/kg i.p.), a brain-penetrating H2 receptor antagonist, or thioperamide (5 mg/kg i.p.), a selective H3 receptor antagonist. The effect of N alpha-methylhistamine was also attenuated by combined treatment with phentolamine and propranolol (5 and 15 mg/kg s.c., respectively) and by pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (20 mg/kg i.p., 2 days before). N alpha-Methylhistamine markedly decreased histamine turnover in the mouse brain. These findings suggest that intestinal transit is inhibited by N alpha-methylhistamine via stimulation of central H1 but not H3 receptors and that stimulation of the sympathetic system is involved in this effect.", 
    "80": "The possibility that the antihypertensive adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol, phentolamine and metoprolol) may alter hepatic lipid metabolism was examined in freshly dispersed rat hepatocytes with [1-14C]oleate. Propranolol (1.8 x 10(-4) M) and phentolamine (1.4 x 10(-4) M) increased incorporation of [1-14C]oleate into cholesteryl esters by 51 and 92%, respectively, and decreased ketogenesis by 46 and 62%, respectively. While neither drug affected incorporation into total phospholipid, propranolol decreased triglyceride synthesis by 37%. These effects of propranolol and phentolamine may not occur through beta- or alpha-receptor inhibition since neither epinephrine nor norepinephrine reversed the effects of the adrenoceptor antagonists. Although epinephrine and norepinephrine per se did not alter the incorporation of [1-14C]oleate into triglyceride, phospholipid, cholesteryl esters or ketone bodies, they stimulated the production of 14CO2 (control 5.6 +/- 1.3; epinephrine 7.6 +/- 1.1; norepinephrine 9.1 +/- 0.2 nmol oleate incorporated/mg protein), and these effects were reversed by phentolamine and propranolol. The data suggest that adrenoceptor antagonists exert direct effects on hepatic metabolism of oleate.", 
    "81": "DL-Propranolol (PRO), a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and the neuropeptide somatostatin (SS) have central nervous system depressant and anticonvulsive properties. To investigate a possible relationship between these two components, we studied the influence of PRO and DL-isoproterenol (ISO), a beta-adrenergic agonist, on the somatostatinergic system in the rat frontoparietal cortex. The short- (5 h) and long-term (14 days) administration of ISO (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), or of PRO (10 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) content in the frontoparietal cortex of male Wistar rats. Both short- and long-term ISO administration decreased the number of specific [125I]Tyr11-SS receptors in synaptosomes from frontoparietal cortex (31%, P < 0.05, and 26%, P < 0.02, after short- and long-term administration, respectively) without changing the affinity constant. This decrease in the number of [125I]Tyr11-SS receptors was not due to a direct effect of ISO on these receptors since no decrease in binding was produced by high concentrations of ISO (10(-5) M) when added in vitro. This decrease could be blocked by pretreatment with PRO. Short- and long-term administration of PRO alone produced an increase in the [125I]Tyr11-SS binding in frontoparietal cortex (26%, P < 0.02, and 40%, P < 0.001, after short- or long-term administration, respectively) without changing the affinity constant.", 
    "82": "Nonobese, hereditary hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) rats provide an interesting model of hypertriglyceridemia, glucose intolerance, and hypertension. In age-matched 15 HTG and 16 control Wistar rats fed on a high sucrose diet (70 cal%) for 6 weeks, we measured insulin sensitivity in vivo and some parameters of sympatoadrenal system. Using euglycemic clamps with administration of 2-deoxy[1-3H]glucose, we found whole body insulin resistance and decreased glucose metabolic index Rg' in soleus muscle, epitrochlearis muscle, diaphragm, and white adipose tissue in HTG rats. We found higher levels of plasma epinephrine and higher excretion of vanilmandelic and homovanilic acids in HTG rats. The binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenol to the heart membrane fraction was similar in both groups, but the dissociation constant Kd was increased by 75% in the heart of HTG rats.", 
    "83": "Predisposition to obesity has been suggested to be related to a low energy expenditure (EE). This condition could be counteracted by physical exercise. In the present study we wanted to elucidate if aerob training could increase sedentary 24-hour energy expenditure in formerly obese subjects. Seven reduced-obese premenopausal women were studied in a respiration chamber before and after a three month period of aerobic training. No significant effects of training were seen on daytime, sleeping or total 24-hour EE. However, the change in daytime EE was positively correlated to the change in VO2max. Sleeping and 24-hour respiratory quotients were slightly increased after the training period. In order to reveal a possible role of the sympathetic nervous system in the observed effect of training, additional experiments were performed with beta blockade. However, no interactions between training and beta blockade were found.", 
    "84": "The purpose of these experiments was to examine the effects of the recently discovered gastrointestinal peptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), and two structurally related peptides, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and secretin, on release of peptide YY (PYY) in conscious dogs. Intravenous administration of PACAP-27 or -38 stimulated a dose-related release of PYY; PACAP-27 was more potent than PACAP-38. PACAP-stimulated release of PYY was inhibited significantly by atropine, whereas ganglionic or beta-adrenergic blockade with hexamethonium and propranolol treatment, respectively, did not affect PACAP-induced release of PYY significantly (P > 0.05). These results indicate that PACAP-induced release of PYY is cholinergic dependent and that beta-adrenergic tone and ganglionic transmission do not participate in PACAP-induced release of PYY. PACAP may play a role in the neural regulation of PYY release.", 
    "85": "The effect of the 10-day dexamethasone administration on serotonin-2 (5-HT2) and beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was evaluated in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The dexamethasone treatment (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) significantly increased the density of the 5-HT2 receptor binding sites in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a decreased density of beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was observed in rat cortex. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the densities of the 5-HT2 or beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in rat hippocampus using dexamethasone. The results suggest that dexamethasone differentially modulates the 5-HT2 and beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in rat brain.", 
    "86": "The efficacy of beta 1-adrenoceptor-G protein coupling was studied in postmortem temporal cortex synaptic membranes from a series of control and Alzheimer's disease subjects. For the control cases, the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) gave a significant reduction in the affinity of the agonist isoprenaline to displace binding of the radiolabelled antagonist (+/)-4-(3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy)[5,7-3H]benzimidazol-2-one ([3H]CGP-12177). This effect was attributed to the conversion of high agonist-affinity sites to a lower-affinity state and was not found for the Alzheimer's disease cases. These data indicate that a disruption of beta 1-adrenoceptor-G protein coupling occurs in the temporal cortex of Alzheimer's disease patients.", 
    "87": "The pharmacological activity of atherosperminine, isolated from Fissistigma glaucescens, was determined in isolated guinea-pig trachealis. Atherosperminine (25-100 microM) and theophylline (10-1000 microM) both inhibited the contractile response caused by carbachol, prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), U46619 (thromboxane A2 analogue), leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and Ca2+ (in the presence of 120 mM KCl) in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition was characterized by a rightwards shift of the concentration-response curves with suppression of the maximal contraction. Propranolol (1 microM), glibenclamide (10 microM) and removal of tracheal epithelium did not modify the relaxant action of atherosperminine. Atherosperminine (25 and 50 microM) caused a 2.4- and 5.0-fold, respectively, potentiation of the action of forskolin to cause tracheal relaxation but did not potentiate the action of sodium nitroprusside or cromakalim. Atherosperminine (50 microM) potentiated the action of forskolin to increase tissue cAMP content and, in higher concentrations (100 and 250 microM), itself increased tissue cAMP but not cGMP content. Atherosperminine markedly inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase but not cGMP phosphodiesterase in homogenates of guinea-pig trachealis. It is concluded that atherosperminine exerts a non-specific relaxant effect on the trachealis. Its major mechanism of action appears to be inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase, perhaps with a minor effect on cGMP phosphodiesterase at higher concentrations.", 
    "88": "The stimulus for carbon monoxide-induced cardiac hypertrophy was investigated. Two experiments were carried out in which adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed continuously to 700 ppm CO for 30 days (CO) or inhaled room air (Air). In each experiment, 2/3s of the rats received either the beta-1-adrenergic blocker, atenolol, or the alpha-1 adrenergic blocking agent, prazosin, in the food daily, at low and high doses. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was significantly lowered (20-25 mmHg) by CO alone. Atenolol alone lowered SBP, but only at the high dose. Low dose and particularly high dose atenolol, lowered SBP even more in the CO rats. Prazosin lowered SBP, particularly at the high dose and further lowered SBP in the CO rats. Heart rate was significantly lowered by atenolol and prazosin alone at both doses in the Air rats. Heart rate remained the same or was slightly elevated by CO exposure. Heart rate in the presence of CO was significantly depressed by prazosin, but not by atenolol. Carbon monoxide alone resulted in 30-43% and 18-25% weight increases in right ventricle free-wall (RV) and left ventricle + septum (LV+S), respectively, relative to untreated controls. Neither low nor high dose prazosin significantly decreased RV and LV+S weights in the CO rats. Low dose atenolol failed to alter RV and LV+S weights in the CO rats; however, high dose atenolol, significantly (P < 0.01) increased RV weight in the CO rats. Right ventricle weight was positively correlated with SBP lowering by CO and/or atenolol, or prazosin. Carbon monoxide exposure increased lung/body weight ratio; atenolol, but not prazosin, attenuated this effect. Hematocrit increased from 50% in the Air to 77% in the CO rats; it was unaltered by prazosin or atenolol treatment. Thus, CO-induced cardiac hypertrophy develops in spite of lowered SBP (i.e. lowered LV afterload), and the blockade of either alpha or beta-1 receptors. It is suggested that the increased ventricular preload caused by atenolol and prazosin is directly responsible for the cardiac hypertrophy, regardless of the ameliorating effects of decreased inotropicity and heart rate produced by the adrenergic blocking agents. The results suggest the potentially powerful role of enhanced preload in driving myocardial hypertrophy.",

    "90": "In 15 patients (7 men, 8 women, aged 40 to 79 years) undergoing catheterization for chest pain, heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and coronary arterial area (by computer-assisted quantitative angiography) were measured (1) at baseline, (2) 15 minutes after intranasal cocaine, 2 mg/kg, then (3) 5 minutes after intravenous saline (n = 6) or labetalol, 0.25 mg/kg (n = 9).", 
    "91": "Of 40 coronary arterial segments analyzed, cocaine induced a 13% +/- 10% (mean +/- standard deviation) decrease in coronary arterial area in 32. Subsequently, no variable changed after saline administration. Although labetalol reduced mean arterial pressure (117 +/- 14 mm Hg after cocaine, 110 +/- 11 mm Hg after labetalol; p < 0.05), it induced no change in the coronary arterial area (3.47 +/- 1.37 mm2 after cocaine, 3.37 +/- 1.32 mm2 after labetalol; p = NS).",

    "97": "The effects of four different antihypertensive drugs (the Ca(2+)-channel blocker felodipine, the beta-blocker metoprolol, the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril, and the alpha-blocking agent doxazosin) on microalbuminuria and renal hemodynamics were evaluated in a double-blind, crossover study in 17 patients (10 women, seven men, aged 39 +/- 14 years) with mild-to-moderate essential arterial hypertension and microalbuminuria. Patients were studied after a 2-week placebo phase preceded by 2 weeks off all medication and after 12 weeks of treatment with each drug. Between each drug treatment, there was another 14-day placebo washout period. At the end of the study, we performed two additional 2-week placebo periods. After each placebo and treatment period, we measured albumin excretion during a 3-day collecting period. Renal hemodynamics were assessed by clearance techniques (inulin and p-aminohippurate clearance) at the end of the first and last placebo periods and after each treatment period. All drugs reduced mean arterial pressure and microalbuminuria to a similar and statistically significant (p < 0.05) extent (mean arterial pressure: placebo phase, 116 +/- 5 mm Hg; felodipine, 101 +/- 4 mm Hg; metoprolol, 101 +/- 5 mm Hg; ramipril, 101 +/- 4 mm Hg; doxazosin, 102 +/- 5 mm Hg; urinary albumin excretion: placebo phase, 46 +/- 50 mg/day; felodipine, 18 +/- 23 mg/day; metoprolol, 14 +/- 12 mg/day; ramipril, 16 +/- 16 mg/day; doxazosin, 14 +/- 14 mg/day).

    "98": "The effects of long-term treatment with captopril and conventional therapy on albuminuria and metabolic parameters were compared in 74 hypertensive type II diabetics with normal serum creatinine. Patients were treated double-blind with either captopril monotherapy or combined with hydrochlorothiazide or therapy with metoprolol, hydrochlorothiazide, or both for 36 months. The treatment was titrated to achieve goal diastolic blood pressure of < or = 85 mm Hg. The reductions in blood pressures during treatment were similar in patients with (n = 21) and without (n = 53) microalbuminuria treated with either captopril or conventional therapy. No significant changes in albuminuria occurred in normoalbuminuric patients with either therapy. Although albuminuria fell in nearly all patients with microalbuminuria treated with captopril, it rose in eight of 12 patients on conventional therapy, with macroalbuminuria developing in two of them. Renal function was preserved by both types of treatment in both patient groups. Long-term treatment with either conventional therapy or captopril did not alter metabolic variables. We conclude that captopril alone or in combination decreases albuminuria and prevents the development of macroalbuminuria in hypertensive type II diabetics with persistent microalbuminuria. The renoprotective effect of this agent, however, remains to be demonstrated with longer term data on renal function. Aggressive antihypertensive treatment with either captopril or conventional therapy appears to be effective in preventing the onset of microalbuminuria in most normoalbuminuric patients. In contrast, with previous short-term studies, the use of converting enzyme inhibitors or conventional therapy did not cause adverse metabolic effects.", 
    "99": "Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and norepinephrine are markedly elevated during episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Although atrial distention appears to be the major stimulus for ANF release, reflex changes in autonomic tone might also contribute. Plasma ANF and norepinephrine levels, sinus node cycle length, systolic blood pressure, and mean right atrial pressure were therefore assessed during rapid right ventricular pacing at 150 beats/min for 10 minutes. In five patients (group 1) observations were made without autonomic blockade, and another five patients (group 2) had ventricular pacing after cardiac autonomic blockade. In group 1 systolic blood pressure fell during ventricular pacing from 122 +/- 4 to 105 +/- 5 mm Hg (p < 0.02), norepinephrine levels increased from 195 +/- 26 to 411 +/- 71 pg/ml (p < 0.02), and sinus node cycle length decreased from 936 +/- 99 to 688 +/- 58 msec (p < 0.02). Right atrial pressure was elevated from 2.6 +/- 0.6 to 7.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg (p < 0.02), and ANF levels increased from 161 +/- 23 to 240 +/- 26 pg/ml (p < 0.05). Whereas systolic blood pressure, norepinephrine, sinus cycle length, and right atrial pressure returned promptly to baseline levels when ventricular pacing was stopped, ANF levels continued to rise (296 +/- 37 pg/ml; p < 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

A detailed symptom assessment, bicycle exercise testing, echocardiography and Holter monitoring were performed in each period.", 
    "103": "Two patients withdrew from the study owing to symptomatic sinus bradycardia during nadolol therapy. Neither drug improved maximal oxygen consumption (placebo 26 +/- 8, verapamil 23 +/- 6, nadolol 21 +/- 7 ml/kg per min; p = 0.1). Peak exercise work load was reduced by > or = 10 W in 13 patients (81%) during nadolol therapy and in 4 patients (25%) during verapamil therapy (p = 0.005, nadolol vs. verapamil). Despite the effects on exercise capacity, 13 patients (81%) preferred drug treatment (8 verapamil, 5 nadolol) over placebo (p = 0.001). Verapamil improved reported performance at work compared with nadolol (p = 0.01) and tended to improve other measures of health-related behavior and symptoms compared with nadolol and placebo.", 
    "104": "In patients with mild or moderately symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, exercise capacity was not improved by nadolol or verapamil, and individuals were more often impaired by nadolol than with verapamil.

Patients received maximally tolerated doses of sustained release propranolol (mean 293 mg/day), sustained release diltiazem (mean 350 mg/day), nifedipine (mean 79 mg/day) and placebo, each for 2-week periods in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Patients' responses to treatment were assessed by 48-h ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise test (standard Bruce protocol) and diaries of angina. Levels of efficacy for each agent and for each clinical measure were compared using Spearman correlation analysis.", 
    "108": "With placebo there was no correlation among the frequency of ischemic episodes by ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise time to 1.0-mm ST segment depression or frequency of anginal episodes. Furthermore, for a given patient the efficacy of each active medication in reducing ambulatory ischemia was not correlated with response in anginal symptoms or exercise test performance (r = -0.21 to 0.24, p = NS). Within each of these clinical measures, efficacy of one drug was more strongly correlated with efficacy of another drug (r = 0.64 to 0.81 for ambulatory ischemia, 0.48 to 0.56 for exercise test performance and 0.16 to 0.54 for anginal symptoms).", 
    "109": "Different measures of ischemia, specifically ambulatory ischemia assessed by ambulatory ECG monitoring, exercise performance on exercise test and anginal symptoms, are independent.
