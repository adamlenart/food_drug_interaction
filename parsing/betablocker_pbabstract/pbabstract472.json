    "0": "Beta-receptor blocking agents are known for more than 20 years. They are of definite use in the therapy of arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease. Beta-blockers lower the sympathoadrenergic discharge to the heart and circulation, particularly if the former is increased. Beta-blockers induce a negative chronotropic and inotropic effect and inhibit beta 2-mediated vasodilation. Thus beta-sympathicolysis during physical activity results in damping of heart rate increase and of elevation of cardiac contractility. Systolic blood pressure does not increase much, and usually there is no decline in diastolic blood pressure, due to elevated peripheral resistance. With adequate dosage, there may even be a slight increase in diastolic pressure, an effect eventually vaning in chronic therapy. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is elevated to above normal via inhibition of contractility and relaxation of the heart. Stroke volume, cardiac output and the double-product decrease, the arteriovenous oxygen difference under exercise increases clearly and the maximum aerobic performance capacity decrease in healthy individuals. In coronary patients, this may protect against cardiac overload and increase symptom-free physical work capacity, due to a relative decrease in the myocardial O2 requirement and improved coronary perfusion resulting from prolonged diastole. With verified indication (hypertensive-hyperkinetic impairments of cardiovascular function, coronary heart disease), the goal is an overlapping, endurance-oriented training to reduce the overall sympathetic activation, in order to minimize medication in the long run.", 
    "1": "Beta-blockers reduce physical capacity and lead to an increased sensation of muscular fatigue. The limits of endurance capacity, which is important for both leisure-sports and fitness, are set primarily by metabolic factors, because the energy liberation via the metabolism of lipids and carbohydrates is reduced as a result of the inhibition of lipolysis and glycogenolysis. Beta 1-selective blockers influence the physical capacity less effectively on any intensity level as non-selective blockers do. The latter may lead to hypoglycemic reactions. Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathicomimetic activity (ISA) are not superior to others. Physically active patients should be treated with beta 1-selective blockers.", 
    "2": "Beta-adrenoceptor-blockers modify the physical performance due to their haemodynamic and metabolic effects. Additionally, these substances influence the concentration of serum-potassium and the thermoregulation. The reduction in heart rate yields to a diminished cardiac output resulting in a restricted muscular blood flow at submaximal and maximal exercise. After beta-blockade, O2-uptake at submaximal work load as well as maximal aerobic capacity is slightly reduced. Lipolysis is restricted by acute beta-blockade, but this effect can be compensated for by enhancement of catecholamine-independent lipolysis during chronic treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blockers. At submaximal loads, glycogenolysis is not influenced; at maximal exercise, glycogenolysis is reduced by non-selective beta-blockers but not by beta 1-specific ones. Arterial peak lactate concentration usually is diminished. After beta-adrenoceptor-blockade, the concentration of serum-potassium increases slightly, and sweat production is enhanced. Beta-adrenoceptor-blockers influence the performance in different sports to a various extent, due to the multitude of the different effects they take.", 
    "3": "Beta adrenoceptor antagonists bind specifically to beta receptors in a reversible way, so they inhibit beta stimulating actions of beta mimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoprenaline, etc. The effect of beta adrenoceptor antagonism depends on the extent of sympathetic activity and is most pronounced during work and stress. Most beta blockers are administered as racemic mixtures consisting of 50% of the (R)- and 50% of the (S)-enantiomer, but only one enantiomer (e.g. (S)-propranolol) exerts beta blocking activity in therapeutic doses while the other one (e.g. (R)-propranolol) does not. But there is also a number of non-beta blocking actions of beta adrenoceptor antagonists that show variable stereoselectivity. Propranolol is explored most extensively in this field: 1. Only (R)-propranolol inhibits the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. 2. Both (R)- and (S)-propranolol exert class 1 antiarrhythmic activity. 3. Both (R)- and (S)-propranolol decrease the intraocular pressure. In all these indications mentioned above, beta blockade as an unwanted effect could be avoided by administering optically pure (R)-propranolol instead of the racemic mixture. Stereoselectivity does not only influence the effects but also metabolism, protein-binding etc. of beta adrenoceptor antagonists. In fact, the (R)- and the (S)-enantiomer of a beta adrenoceptor antagonist are 2 substances with different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Nevertheless, they are currently used as racemic mixtures in research as well as in therapy without being aware of stereoselective implications although there are nowadays methods available to separate and isolate the optically pure enantiomers of most beta adrenoceptor antagonists with high purity and on large scale at reasonable costs.", 
    "4": "The authors report a case of fetal supraventricular tachycardia with the heart rate of 400/min diagnosed in the 34th week of pregnancy. Congestive heart failure forming non immun hydrops fetalis was occurred by this rhythm disturbance. With digitalis and beta receptor blocker propranolol therapy administered to the mother the rhythm disturbance has stopped, ascites and hydrothorax secondary to fetal congestive heart failure have been abolished. Congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy were excluded by fetal echocardiography. In the 40th week a healthy newborn was delivered by cesarean section and after delivery congenital heart disease, rhythm disorder, infection or metabolic disturbance couldn't be verified. The authors reviewing the literature demonstrate the suggested investigating procedures and the possibilities of therapy in the case of fetal supraventricular tachycardia.", 
    "5": "The effects of adrenoceptor antagonists on heart rate and on arteriolar reactions to epinephrine, terbutaline, vasopressin, angiotensin II or dopamine in the rat cremaster muscle were compared using ECG analysis and quantitative intravital microscopy. Phentolamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced the vasoconstriction of arterioles elicited by topically applied epinephrine (10(-8) to 3.3 x 10(-6) M) while propranolol (0.63 mg/kg i.v.) significantly attenuated the arteriolar vasodilatation elicited by topically applied terbutaline (10(-6) to 10(-4) M). Nebivolol (0.63 mg/kg i.v.) at a dose producing a reduction of resting heart rate equivalent to that caused by propranolol modified neither the epinephrine-induced constriction nor the terbutaline-induced vasodilatation of arterioles. The arteriolar vasoconstriction induced by topically applied vasopressin (9.3 x 10(-9) M), angiotensin II (9.4 x 10(-7) M) or dopamine (5.2 x 10(-5) M) was not modified by nebivolol either. While propranolol reduced the tachycardia and hypotension induced by isoprenaline (0.025, 0.1 microgram/kg i.v.), nebivolol reduced the cardiac rhythm increase but not the blood pressure drop in response to the catecholamine (0.025, 0.1, 0.4 micrograms/kg i.v.). The present intravital microscopic study in the rat demonstrated that, at a dose exerting cardiac beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade, nebivolol is devoid of significant activity on alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta-2-adrenoceptors and on receptors for vasopressin, angiotensin II or dopamine in resistance arterioles.", 
    "6": "We compared reflex heart rate responses elicited during intravenous infusions of phenylephrine or sodium nitroprusside in conscious 4- and 24-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats to determine whether baroreflex regulation changes with age. Underlying neural mechanisms were assessed by repeating baroreflex tests following cholinergic blockade with methylatropine or beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. Basal blood pressures always tended to be higher, while corresponding heart rates were lower, in old than in young rats. Reflex bradycardia (but not tachycardia) was initially weaker in 24-month-old rats as were reductions in both reflex bradycardia and tachycardia after cholinergic blockade. On the other hand, the reduction in reflex tachycardia following beta-adrenergic blockade in old rats was more pronounced and almost equal to that produced by combined cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade. From these results we conclude that with old age in male Sprague-Dawley rats, just as has been shown previously in Fischer 344 rats, predominant efferent pathways for regulating heart rate reflexes are also altered to become almost exclusively beta-adrenergic or sympathetic.", 
    "7": "Two hundred and ninety-two hypertensive patients from general practice who had previously been treated with a diuretic with insufficient effect participated in a randomised trial for a period of three months. A total of 115 patients completed treatment with 50 mg atenolol (Tanormin) and 121 were treated with the combined preparation consisting of 50 mg atenolol and 12.5 mg chlothalidone (Tenoretic Mite) while 56 patients defected from the trial. In both of the groups, the average blood pressure was reduced significantly already after treatment for one month. A significantly greater number of patients receiving combined treatment achieved satisfactory diastolic blood pressures (less than 90 mmHg), the proportions being 78% and 54%, respectively. Better effects from combined treatment were found particularly in patients over 60 years of age and in females. No significant differences were observed between the side-effects of the regimes nor in the laboratory values registered during treatment.", 
    "8": "These experiments examined the effects of separate and concurrent muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade on inhibitory (passive) avoidance performance and spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Pretraining systemic administration of either scopolamine (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) had no significant effect on one-day retention of step-through inhibitory avoidance training. Similarly, pretraining administration of either 0.3 mg/kg scopolamine or 10 mg/kg propranolol did not affect spatial learning in the Morris water maze. However, combined administration of scopolamine and 10.0 mg/kg of propranolol impaired performance on these tasks. These findings further support a role for interactions between norepinephrine and acetylcholine in the modulation of learning and memory and implicate the participation of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in this interaction. Because cholinergic and noradrenergic deterioration is found in aging and Alzheimer's disease, these results also have implications regarding the role of age-related noradrenergic and cholinergic dysfunction in cognitive decline.",

When celiprolol was administered half an hour before isoprenaline, the extent of necrosis caused by catecholamine was reduced. When administered half an hour after isoprenaline administration, the marked protective effect was no longer observed.

    "24": "Regulation of two highly homologous GTP-binding regulatory protein- (G-protein) linked receptors, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, was probed at the level of mRNA in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Expression of the two receptor subtypes at the protein level was defined by competition of radioligand binding with CGP-20712A, a highly selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts express equivalent levels of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Following treatment with dexamethasone and isobutylmethyl xanthine (IBMX), 3T3-L1 cells differentiate to adipocytes and express 4-fold more receptor, predominantly beta 2-subtype (beta 1-/beta 2- ratio, 5:95). Regulation of beta 1- and beta 2-receptor mRNA levels by differentiation, as well as by steroid alone and IBMX alone was probed by DNA excess solution hybridization. A beta 1-receptor antisense probe was constructed from double-stranded DNA assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides. In untreated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts the steady-state levels of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA were equivalent (approximately 1.2 amol mRNA/micrograms total cellular RNA). beta 2-Adrenergic receptor mRNA levels increased 3-fold as 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated to adiopcytes (day 7). mRNA levels for beta 1-adrenergic receptor, in contrast, increased at day 2, but thereafter declined, falling to less than 0.05 amol mRNA/micrograms total cellular RNA by day 7 in adipocytes. A 7-day challenge with dexamethasone reduced by 50% beta 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels. Treatment with IBMX alone reduced mRNA levels for both receptor subtypes. Neither steroid nor IBMX alone promoted differentiation. The present work, for the first time, demonstrates (i) the mRNA levels on a molar basis for two highly homologous G-protein-linked receptors expressed in a single cell, (ii) independent regulation of their mRNA levels that correlates well with receptor expression, and (iii), that it is differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells per se and not treatment with glucocorticoid or IBMX alone that promotes the up-regulation of the beta 2-receptor transcripts and down-regulation of beta 1-receptor transcripts.", 
    "25": "Coronary hemodynamics (coronary blood flow, coronary reserve, myocardial oxygen consumption) were analyzed in both experimental and clinical essential hypertension. Significant reduced coronary reserve was found in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Extracoronary reasons for these phenomena were ruled out. Considerable thickening of the coronary resistance vessels (medial hypertrophy) in hypertensive hypertrophy associated with a marked increase in the wall thickness/radius ratio was considered sufficient to explain the impairment of coronary flow. After long-term pharmacotherapy there was normalization of both medial hypertrophy and coronary reserve. This small-vessel abnormality correlates well with clinical findings in hypertensive heart disease (angina and electrocardiographic changes despite normal coronary arteriogram). Moreover, this structural adaptation of the small vessels may carry the inherent risk of an impaired oxygen supply to the hypertrophied myocardium. Thus, late cardiac failure of the hypertrophied heart in hypertension may be attributed, in part, to this microcirculation disorder. Conversely, reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and of hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle by specific pharmacotherapy can be considered a possible approach to the rational prevention of cardiac failure in hypertensive patients. For future investigations, controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings with regard to prevention of heart failure, and pharmacotherapeutic studies are necessary to define the optimal drug regimen for reversal of vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy.",

    "28": "The establishment of latent disturbances of the sinus node function is with high security successful by the determination of the sinus node recovery time only after medicamentous provocation with propranolol/atropin and verapamil, since the sensitivity of the determination of the sinus node recovery time is to small in the up to now usual way and in normal findings it is not able to exclude a sinus node dysfunction. The course of the investigation could be optimized according to the fact that despite complete medicamentous provocation only one running through stimulation is necessary without an endangering of the patient being the results. By this means of 75 patients 32 patients (43%) could be identified as sinus node syndrome of different degree of severity. On the basis of the improved ability of statement the determination of the sinus node recovery time for the diagnostics in patients with unclear syncopes and inconspicuous findings of the ECG should be performed only after a combined medicamentous provocation.", 
    "29": "The effect of a long-term propranolol administration on portal hemodynamics, liver function tests and endoscopic findings of esophageal varices were evaluated in 27 patients with established esophageal varices.

    "30": "The sympathetic nervous system exerts important control over the coronary circulation. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that reflex input from skeletal muscle during static contraction causes coronary vasoconstriction. Similarly, stimulation of abdominal visceral chemosensitive afferents can, on occasions, elicit coronary vasoconstriction or limit the extent of vasodilation so that the myocardium needs to extract additional oxygen from arterial blood. Recently, we have examined the innervation of the coronary collateral circulation and found that these vessels contain catecholamines which demonstrate a pattern of fluorescence similar to that of catecholamines in the native circulation. Furthermore, stimulation of alpha 2- but not alpha 1-adrenoceptors can cause an increase in collateral vascular resistance. Thus, reflex input into the coronary circulation, perhaps during static exercise or post-prandially, can cause coronary vasoconstriction. Such constriction occurs in native coronary vessels and has the potential to be present in the coronary collateral circulation.", 
    "31": "Nonselective beta 1,beta 2-adrenergic blockade (nBB) reduces the cutaneous blood flow and sweating responses to exercise in normotensive men and results in a relative increase in heat storage. To determine whether hypertensives incur similar problems in thermoregulation, we studied six mildly hypertensive men during 30 min of cycle ergometer exercise at 60% maximum O2 uptake at 22 degrees C. Each subject ingested either propranolol (Pr, 80 mg; nBB), metoprolol (Me, 50 mg; cardioselective, sBB), pindolol (Pi, 5 mg; nBB), or placebo (Pl) capsules 2 h before exercise in a double-blind crossover design. Steady-state exercise heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and cardiac output (Q) were reduced from means (+/- SD) of 134 +/- 7 beats.min-1, 181 +/- 5 mm Hg, and 14.5 +/- 0.9 l.min-1, respectively, with Pl to 107 +/- 3 beats.min-1, 159 +/- 7 mm Hg, and 12.7 +/- 1.1 l.min-1, respectively, with beta-blockade (BB, average of Pr, Me, and Pi) (P less than 0.05). During nBB, we found 1) a decrease in peak forearm blood flow (FBF) and 2) a reduction in the slopes of the FBF-esophageal temperature (Tes) and local chest sweat rate-Tes (Pr only) relationships. These resulted in a trend toward higher Tes at 30 min of exercise. Forearm vascular resistance was increased with nBB but not sBB, demonstrating a relative cutaneous vasoconstriction during nBB. Since nBB and sBB produced similar effects on the central circulatory variables (SBP and Q) but had different effects on FBF and FVR, our data do not support a role for baroreflexes in the altered control of FBF during BB.", 
    "32": "This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to establish whether beta blockers or calcium-channel blockers limit exercise capacity and training responses in men with mild hypertension. Circuit weight and aerobic training was used to assess the effects of drugs on cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength. Fifty-two sedentary men, ages 25-59 yr, with a diastolic blood pressure of 90-105 mm Hg off drugs, without significant ST depression during maximal stress testing, received diltiazem, propranolol, or placebo. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and exercise duration during treadmill testing, as well as one-repetition maximal strength, were assessed on eight weight machines after a single-blind placebo baseline, after 2 wk of drug run-in, and after 10 wk of exercise training. Total daily doses were 240 mg for propranolol and 360 mg for diltiazem. Propranolol decreased VO2max after drug run-in (P less than 0.05). Exercise training increased VO2max (P less than 0.05) in the diltiazem and placebo groups. After training VO2max in the propranolol group increased (P less than 0.05) from run-in but not beyond baseline levels. Thus, the reduction of VO2max consequent to propranolol therapy limited the overall benefits of training. Exercise duration did not change with run-in and increased (P less than 0.05) with training by 22%, 19%, and 10% for the diltiazem, placebo, and propranolol groups, respectively. Strength after run-in was unchanged, and exercise training increased strength (P less than 0.0001) on all weight machines in all groups. The results show an advantage of diltiazem to propranolol, particularly among physically active patients engaged in aerobic exercise who require antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "33": "The effect of partial gastrectomy on the pharmacokinetic parameters of (+)- and (-)-propranolol were investigated in six dogs. (+/-)-Propranolol (3 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally before and after surgery and the plasma concentrations of (+)- and (-)-propranolol were determined using an indirect enantioseparation technique. There were significant differences (p less than or equal to 0.05, paired t-test) in the area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) between (+)- and (-)-propranolol. The ratio AUC(+):AUC(-) was 1.73 +/- 0.28. These differences between the enantiomers remained unchanged after surgery. Other pharmacokinetic parameters showed no stereoselectivity. After partial gastrectomy, there was a slight, but nonsignificant decrease in time to reach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) and in the absorption half-life for both enantiomers. The maximum plasma concentration increased slightly. The elimination half-life and the mean residence time remained unchanged before and after surgery. Therefore, it is unlikely that there are any clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of (+)- and (-)-propranolol after partial gastrectomy.",

On daily EC challenge there was no tolerance to this response but the response was blocked by propranolol. Repeated daily administration of exogenous adrenaline or EC challenge increased basal total leucocyte and polymorph but decreased the lymphocyte counts. It is suggested that repeated exposure to exogenous adrenaline or endogenous adrenaline (through EC) somehow sensitizes the system responsible for the release of polymorphs from the bone marrow.", 
    "35": "We describe the use of fludrocortisone in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus, who initially presented with moderate renal insufficiency, high serum potassium, metabolic acidosis, low urine pH, and a high urinary anion gap indicating tubular dysfunction. Renal histology revealed membranous glomerulonephritis and interstitial inflammation. During the course of the disease the patient developed persistent severe hyperkalemia. Dietary potassium restriction and therapy with diuretics combined with cation exchange resins failed to decrease potassium levels sufficiently. Drug therapy including cyclosporin A, enalapril, atenolol, phenytoin, necessary to control active disease and severe hypertension contributed to elevated potassium levels. Effective correction of hyperkalemia was achieved by fludrocortisone treatment. We conclude that fludrocortisone is a potent therapeutic approach for selected patients suffering from life threatening hyperkalemia, in whom potassium elevating drugs cannot be withdrawn.",

    "37": "The effects of tidal volume amplitude on bronchopulmonary reactivity were investigated in three groups of 14 anesthetized paralyzed mechanically ventilated guinea pigs. Animals of group 1 served as control; in animals of group 2, both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems were blocked; in animals of group 3, only the parasympathetic system was blocked. In each group, the animals were randomly divided into two subgroups characterized by their ventilatory pattern: rate of 60/min with a 6-ml/kg tidal volume or rate of 40/min with a 9-ml/kg tidal volume. Bronchopulmonary reactivity to infused histamine was assessed by the respiratory compliance and conductance values measured during bronchoconstriction and expressed as a percentage of the corresponding basal values. In group 1 the animals ventilated with a 9-ml/kg tidal volume were found significantly less reactive than those ventilated with a 6-ml/kg tidal volume. This difference was abolished in groups 2 and 3. These results demonstrate that the effects of increased tidal volume on bronchopulmonary reactivity are vagally mediated and suggest that the decrease observed in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction is mainly due to reflex effects evoked by stretch receptor stimulation.", 
    "38": "This paper describes a method for the preparation of co-cultures of rat heart cells and bovine adrenal chromaffin paraneurons. The most suitable condition for heart cell isolation was when a combination of trypsin-DNAse I in Locke's solution was used for digestion. The best co-culture conditions were obtained when 10(6) heart cells were plated on 7- to 8-d-old adrenal chromaffin paraneuron cultures containing 0.5 x 10(6) cells per 35-mm diameter culture dishes. Measurements of DNA (heart cells and chromaffin paraneurons), monitoring of beating frequency (heart cells), and catecholamine (chromaffin paraneurons) levels and release indicated that both cell types remain viable and functional for several weeks. Heart cells started their characteristic contractile activity 24 h earlier when plated either on viable or lysed chromaffin paraneurons, an effect apparently due to faster surface adhesion of heart cells. The beating frequency of heart cells increased after treatment of co-cultures with either noradrenaline or nicotine, with the latter agent acting indirectly through the release of chromaffin paraneuron catecholamines. Propranolol produced a dose-related inhibition of the responses to either noradrenaline or nicotine, thus suggesting that the increase in myocyte's beating activity was mediated through beta-receptors. Anti-myosin and anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunostaining was used for cell type identification and for the demonstration of body-to-body and process-to-process contacts between adrenal chromaffin paraneurons and heart cells. This co-culture system will serve as a starting point of further studies directed to understand a) the influence of a cell type on the development and on the phenotypic characteristics of a second cell type and b) the interaction of cells derived from different organs and species.", 
    "39": "Human sperm, separated on Percoll gradients and transferred to cell culture medium, were exposed to various concentrations of propranolol (0.8-800 microM) or caffeine (3 microM-17 mM) for 4 h. Their motility pattern was analysed after 5 min and 4 h, employing the computerized Cellsoft system. Curvilinear velocity (VCL), percentage motile sperm, linearity (LIN), mean amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALHMEAN) and beat cross-frequency (BCF) were assessed. Both drugs had a practically immediate effect on the sperm. Propranolol concentrations greater than 80 microM had a negative effect on all movement variables, except VCL and ALHMEAN, which showed a slight, non-significant, initial increase. LIN and the percentage motile sperm appeared to be somewhat negatively affected at lower concentrations (80 microM) than the other variables, and were reduced further at higher concentrations and with time. The presence of 800 microM propranolol immobilized all sperm within 4 h. Caffeine at 1.7 and 5 mM, increased VCL and ALHMEAN. In contrast, the highest caffeine concentration tested (17 mM) had a negative effect on all variables at 4 h after addition.", 
    "40": "We investigated the involvement of inhibitory innervation in reflex tracheal dilatation (RTD) induced by inflating the lungs in dogs. RTD was inhibited about 50% by 100 micrograms propranolol injected into the cranial thyroid artery, but was unaffected by adrenalectomy. Residual RTD under beta-blockade was abolished by sections of both the bilateral superior laryngeal nerves and spinal cord at the C1 level. These findings suggest that RTD may be mediated by adrenergic innervation and partly by nonadrenergic inhibitory innervation.", 
    "41": "This investigation examined the effect of formaldehyde (HCHO) on cardiac function in in vitro cardiac preparations and in situ hearts of guinea pigs and rabbits. Though HCHO (0.2-4 mg/kg, i.v.) produced noticeable bradycardiac and negative inotropic responses in anesthetized guinea pigs and rabbits, the responses to HCHO were far less in isolated guinea pig auricles and perfused hearts (Langendorff's preparations). The inhibitory responses to HCHO in the isolated auricles and perfused hearts were obtained at concentrations 200-400 times and 4-8 times higher than the blood concentrations attained in anesthetized animals, respectively. The responses in the isolated preparations were not significantly affected by propranolol. The bradycardiac response to the intravenously administered HCHO in anesthetized animals was not significantly affected by atropine or vagotomy, but was markedly attenuated by propranolol, reserpine or surgical denervation of the heart. These results indicate that the direct action of HCHO on the heart plays only a small role in the negative chronotropic response to HCHO in anesthetized animals. Furthermore, the negative chronotropic effect of HCHO in animals seems to be caused mainly by the inhibition of sympathetic nervous activity through the central nervous system.", 
    "42": "Using an in vitro method the authors have investigated whether 8-hydroxycarteolol.HCl(8-OH carteolol) and 8-OH carteolol with benzalkonium chloride affected intact isolated porcine corneas to the same or to a different degree as carteolol.HCl (carteolol) or carteolol with benzalkonium chloride. These ophthalmically used drugs were applied as solutions of varying concentrations to the epithelial surface only, to the endothelial surface only, or to both surfaces of porcine corneas. The resultant opacities were determined using an opacitometer. In general, 8-OH carteolol and 8-OH carteolol with benzalkonium chloride caused less opacity to develop than carteolol and carteolol with benzalkonium chloride. This suggests that 8-OH carteolol may be a safer drug than carteolol for ophthalmic use. It is very interesting to note that compounds with two nitrogens, e.g., 8-OH carteolol, caused greater opacity in the intact cornea when applied to the endothelial surface than when applied to both the epithelial and endothelial surfaces; however, compounds with none or one nitrogen caused greater opacity in the intact cornea when applied to both surfaces than when applied to the endothelial surface.", 
    "43": "A ten year old boy developed features of Tourette syndrome while taking haloperidol for behaviour problems. A record of his tics was kept and followed during his admission in hospital. His symptoms worsened as haloperidol was decreased and improved as the haloperidol was increased. The literature regarding tardive Tourette syndrome is reviewed and potential implications of the case are discussed.", 
    "44": "Thirty-five hypertensive black patients were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either atenolol 100 mg per day (n = 17) or nitrendipine 20 mg daily (n = 18) for six weeks. Atenolol and nitrendipine significantly reduced blood pressure (P less than 0.05 or less). However, the magnitude of the decrease in supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and in standing diastolic pressure was more pronounced (P less than 0.05 or less) in the nitrendipine than in the atenolol group. Neither of the drugs significantly affected the erythrocyte sodium and potassium concentrations or the ouabain-sensitive efflux of sodium. In multiple regression analysis the changes in supine SBP and DBP with nitrendipine were independently and negatively correlated with the patients' age and initial blood pressure, and positively with the change in supine pulse rate; the change in supine SBP was also negatively correlated with initial erythrocyte sodium concentration. Our results suggest that nitrendipine is more efficient than atenolol in hypertensive blacks and that besides older age and higher pre-treatment. BP levels, a higher intracellular sodium concentration could predict a greater response to nitrendipine.", 
    "45": "Twenty-four black hypertensive patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind trial of combinations of nitrendipine, atenolol, and hydrochlorothiazide. After six weeks, blood pressure was normalized in all three treatment groups, i.e. diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg and a decline in diastolic blood pressure of at least 5 mmHg from baseline. The drug combinations containing hydrochlorothiazide were associated with higher incidence of metabolic abnormalities, especially hypokalaemia and hyperuricaemia.", 
    "46": "In 29 patients admitted with their first bleeding episode from oesophageal varices the varices were obliterated within 6 months by treatment with serial endoscopic sclerotherapy and propranolol or with sclerotherapy only. The patients were checked regularly during 18 months after the varices had been obliterated. Variceal recurrence was found in 11 patients (73%; 95% confidence limits, 45-92%) treated with sclerotherapy only and in 2 patients (15%; 95% confidence limits, 2-43%; p less than 0.01) treated with sclerotherapy and propranolol. In nine patients (69%) with recurrence significant variceal bleeding occurred. All recurrences were observed within 12 months after the initial obliteration. Variceal recurrence occurred in 3 Child A patients and in 10 Child B or C patients. All bleeding occurred in Child B or C patients. It is concluded that obliteration of oesophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy and propranolol may be more effective in the long-term control of variceal recurrence than treatment with sclerotherapy only.", 
    "47": "The role of beta-adrenergic receptors in mediating the circadian rhythm of intraocular pressure was examined by determining the effect on intraocular pressure of timolol applied topically at different times during the circadian cycle to New Zealand White rabbits entrained to alternating 12 hr periods of light and dark. Timolol lowered intraocular pressure when applied during the dark but not during the light phase of the circadian cycle. Timolol did not lower intraocular pressure when applied during the dark to animals after cervical ganglionectomy. These results are consistent with the idea that beta-adrenergic receptors participate in mediating the circadian rhythm of intraocular pressure, and suggest that endogenous agonists released by adrenergic nerves in the eye during the dark stimulate ocular beta-adrenergic receptors to increase intraocular pressure in rabbits.", 
    "48": "A case of severe pulmonary valvar stenosis and infundibular obstruction has been reported. Infundibular obstruction was so severe that no catheter could be advanced into the pulmonary artery. Propranolol, 0.5 mg given intravenously, reduced the obstruction and allowed the balloon dilatation of the pulmonary valve to be carried out without complication. Subsequently oral propranolol helped to remove the infundibular obstruction. We strongly recommend the use of propranolol when infundibular obstruction is present prior or after the balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.", 
    "49": "The effects of propranolol on the activity of O2-sensitive chemoreceptors innervated by cranial nerve IX were studied using an isolated, perfused first gill arch preparation from rainbow trout (Onchyrhyncos mykiss). Perfusing the gill with hypoxic perfusate resulted in an increase in chemoreceptor activity. Propranolol (100-200 nmol) added to the perfusate inhibited O2-receptor discharge during both normoxia and hypoxia and attenuated the response to bolus injections of NaCN (25 micrograms). These results suggest that a beta-adrenergic mechanism is involved in O2 chemoreception. They further suggest that the inhibitory effects of propranolol on branchial, O2-sensitive chemoreceptors may contribute to the attenuated hypoxic ventilatory reflex observed in intact fish after propranolol injections.", 
    "50": "The cellular response to hypotonic stimulation was studied with videometric methods in 266 proximal renal tubules dissected from Carassius auratus (goldfish). In hypotonic solutions (low NaCl), cells underwent rapid swelling followed by gradual shrinking toward isotonic volume (volume-regulatory decrease phase, VRD). Hypothermia (8 degrees C), increased extracellular potassium (15, 25, and 40 mM), quinine (0.1 mM), barium (0.5 mM), 4,4'-diisothio-cyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS; 0.02 mM), acetazolamide (0.1 mM), decrements in extracellular bicarbonate, and increases in extracellular chloride impaired VRD. Ouabain (1.0 mM), furosemide (0.1 mM), and the chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylalanine) benzoate (NPPB; 0.001 mM) had no effect. While VRD occurred in the absence of extracellular calcium influx, addition of the calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01 mM) in the presence of ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA; 2.0 mM) impaired this process both in acidic and alkaline media. Trifluoroperazine (0.01 mM) reversibly inhibited VRD. The effect of this calmodulin inhibitor could not be overridden with the cationic ionophore gramicidin (0.5 microM). The data suggest that Carassius proximal renal tubular cells volume regulate in hypotonic solutions by the loss of KCl and osmotically obligated water. We postulate that the main efflux of potassium is through a calcium-gated potassium channel with its counter ion extruded through a calmodulin-regulated Cl(-)-HCO3- exchanger.", 
    "51": "We stimulated regional intracardiac parasympathetic nerve fibers to the atrioventricular (AV) nodal area (AVP stimuli) or to the sinoatrial (SA) nodal area (SAP stimuli) in autonomically decentralized, anesthetized dogs. AVP stimuli increased the AV interval (AV conduction time); the magnitude of the response depended directly on the stimulation frequency. AVP stimuli did not alter the atrial interval (heart period) in spontaneously beating hearts. The magnitude of the negative dromotropic response increased when the atrial interval was shortened. SAP stimuli increased the atrial interval, and the magnitude of the response depended directly on the stimulation frequency. SAP stimuli evoked little or no change in the AV interval in the unpaced heart. When the atrium was paced, SAP stimuli did not change the AV interval in about half of the preparations, and there was a small but significant change in the remaining preparations. The negative dromotropic or chronotropic response to AVP or SAP stimuli was potentiated by physostigmine and blocked by atropine. These results suggest that 1) AVP stimuli induce a selective negative dromotropic response, and 2) this negative dromotropic effect is secondarily affected by heart period, by the pacemaking site, and by atrial activation patterns, but it does not affect the sinus cycle length in the dog heart.", 
    "52": "The effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) I(alpha) (human), CGRP II(beta) (human), CGRP (rat), and [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat) on the resting tone of opossum internal anal sphincter (IAS) were studied. Different CGRPs identified above produced a concentration-dependent fall in the resting tension of the IAS. CGRP II (human) was most potent, while [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat) was the least. The fall in IAS tension caused by CGRP II (human) was not modified by the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, beta adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin. In contrast to the other CGRP analogs, [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37 (rat) produced no significant effects on the resting tension of the IAS. However, the fragment caused significant rightward shifts in the concentration-effect curves of different CGRP analogs examined on the IAS. [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37 (rat) was found to be almost equipotent in antagonizing the inhibitory effects of CGRP (rat) and [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat), but was approximately 12 and 4 times more potent in antagonizing the responses of CGRP I (human) and CGRP II (human), respectively, as compared to that of CGRP (rat) and [Tyr0]-CGRP (rat). Calcitonin, on the other hand, caused a rise in the IAS tension by its action directly at the smooth muscle and this was not modified by [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37. Thus, we conclude that: 1) CGRP causes a fall in the resting tension of IAS by its action directly at the smooth muscle; 2) [Tyr0]-CGRP 28-37 (rat) may serve as an antagonist of CGRP responses and 3) CGRP and calcitonin produce opposite actions on the resting IAS tension by the activation of their own receptors at the smooth muscle cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Previous studies of the effects of age on the disposition of propranolol have produced variable results. We evaluated the stereoselective disposition and protein binding of propranolol enantiomers in 10 young (mean age, 28 years) and 10 older (mean age, 64 years) healthy subjects. After receiving racemic propranolol orally for 6 days, the oral clearances of d-propranolol and l-propranolol were lower by 13% and 17% in the older group compared to the young group, but these differences were not statistically significant. The older subjects had higher alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations (p less than 0.05) and lower unbound fractions of l-propranolol (p less than 0.05). After protein binding was accounted for, the unbound oral clearance of each enantiomer was similar in both groups. l-Propranolol was more highly protein bound than d-propranolol (p less than 0.05) in both young and older subjects. The unbound oral clearance d/l ratio was not different from unity in either group, indicating that the stereoselective differences in oral clearance were largely attributable to the stereoselective differences in protein binding.", 
    "54": "To evaluate the influence of multiple dose propranolol administration on the single dose pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its active metabolite, quinaprilat, a drug-drug interaction study was performed in ten healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single 20 mg quinapril oral dose on Days 1 and 16 of the study. Oral propranolol doses of 40 mg BID were initiated on Day 3, titrated gradually to 80 mg TID by Day 10, and continued at 80 mg TID through Day 17. Comparable mean quinapril pharmacokinetic parameter values as well as comparable mean quinaprilat pharmacokinetic parameter values determined following quinapril administered alone and following quinapril administered with propranolol, indicate that propranolol does not alter the single dose pharmacokinetics of quinapril or quinaprilat.", 
    "55": "Standard evaluation of children with sinus node (SN) dysfunction cannot distinguish abnormal autonomic tone from intrinsic SN disease. This distinction has potentially important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Intrinsic heart rate (IHR)--the peak heart rate (HR) measured during pharmacologic combined autonomic blockade--reflects intrinsic SN function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of IHR--and its relationship with resting heart rate (RHR)--in distinguishing autonomic influence from intrinsic SN disease among children with SN dysfunction. IHR was determined in the electrophysiology laboratory using intravenous propranolol, 0.2 mg/kg, followed by intravenous atropine, 0.04 mg/kg; the peak HR recorded was the IHR. IHR was measured in two groups. Seven control subjects, defined as patients with normal noninvasive SN testing, had IHR mean of 128 +/- 24 beats/min; this was greater than RHR mean of 89 +/- 16 beats/min (p less than 0.01). Eight patients with abnormal noninvasive SN testing had IHR mean of 103 +/- 6 beats/min; this was greater than RHR mean of 71 +/- 9 beats/min (p less than 0.01). We therefore reached the following conclusions. (1) Among this particular group of patients with abnormal noninvasive SN testing, IHR was consistently in the normal range for age and greater than RHR, suggesting that excess vagal tone can play a significant role in the expression of SN dysfunction. (2) Among normal individuals, IHR is age-related, decreasing with advancing age. IHR greater than RHR suggests that vagal tone predominates in the normal resting state as the net increase in HR during combined autonomic blockade is due to blockade of vagally mediated chronotropic inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "Anxiety and depression for 399 survivors of a 1,102-member heart disease cohort were assessed 8 to 9 years post-hospitalization. Approximately one-third reported symptoms of emotional distress and one-fourth were on anti-anxiety drugs. Predictors of anxiety and depression were analyzed through logistic regression. Subjects age 65 and over were less likely than younger patients to report anxiety or depression and also reported less heart-associated disability, the strongest predictor of distress for both age groups. Other significant predictors included a previous history of distress, low income, female sex, and beta blocker use.", 
    "57": "Coronary vasomotion was studied at rest and during bicycle exercise with biplane quantitative coronary arteriography in 28 patients with coronary artery disease. Patients were divided into two groups; the first 18 patients served as controls (group 1), and the next 10 patients were treated with propranolol 0.1 mg/kg, which was infused intravenously before exercise (group 2). Luminal area of a normal and a stenotic vessel segment was determined at rest, during supine bicycle exercise, and 5 minutes after sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin after exercise. In group 1, the normal vessel showed vasodilation (+16%, p less than 0.001) during exercise, whereas the stenotic vessel segment showed vasoconstriction (-31%, p less than 0.001). After sublingual administration of nitroglycerin, there was coronary vasodilation of both normal (+36%, p less than 0.001 vs. rest) and stenotic (+20%, p less than 0.001) vessel segments. Patients with angina pectoris during supine exercise (n = 10) had significantly (p less than 0.05) more vasoconstriction (-36%) than patients without angina (-23%). In group 2, intravenous administration of propranolol at rest was associated with a decrease in luminal area of both normal (-24%, p less than 0.001) and stenotic (-43%, p less than 0.001) vessel segments; however, during subsequent exercise, both normal (-2%, p = NS vs. rest) and stenotic (-3%, p = NS vs. rest) vessel segments dilated when compared with the measurements after propranolol. Administration of nitroglycerin further increased luminal area of both vessel segments (normal segment, +23%, p less than 0.001; stenotic segment, +46%, p less than 0.001 vs. rest). It is concluded that dynamic exercise in patients with coronary artery disease is associated with coronary vasodilation of the normal and vasoconstriction of the stenotic coronary arteries. Patients with exercise-induced angina had significantly more stenosis vasoconstriction than patients without angina although minimal luminal area at rest was similar. Intravenous administration of propranolol is accompanied by a significant decrease in coronary luminal area of both normal and stenotic vessel segments at rest, which is overridden by dynamic exercise and sublingual nitroglycerin. The reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption and the prevention of exercise-induced stenosis vasoconstriction might explain the beneficial effect of beta-blocker treatment in most patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "58": "The usefulness of beta blockers in the treatment of congestive heart failure has been questioned. We selected 11 patients, mean age 47.1 +/- 13.8, affected by dilated cardiomyopathy in NYHA class III, who had been taking digoxin and diuretics for a long time. Atenolol 50 mg was added to conventional therapy. Both before and 3 months after treatment a clinical evaluation, chest x-ray, an exercise test, and an echocardiogram were performed. We observed an improvement of NYHA class in five patients. However, the exercise test showed no improvement: 2310 +/- 1299 vs. 2902 +/- 983 total kgm (ns). The echocardiogram showed improvements of the end-systolic diameter (from 6.3 +/- 1 cm to 5.9 +/- 0.8 cm; p less than 0.02), the fractional shortening (from 13.6 +/- 6.3% to 15.2 +/- 5.6%; p less than 0.05) the radius/thickness ratio (from 4.14 +/- 0.5 to 3.5 +/- 0.5; p less than 0.05), and the wall stress (from 208.4 +/- 49 g/cm2 to 163.5 +/- 41 g/cm2; p less than 0.02). The inotropic state index did not show any changes. We conclude that in some patients with dilated cardiomyopathy beta blockers may improve the clinical status and left ventricular performance.", 
    "59": "Treatment with nisoldipine (2 x 10 mg tablets once daily) and nifedipine (2 x 10 mg capsules three times daily) in patients with severe, but stable effort angina pretreated with atenolol (100 mg once daily in 19 patients and 50 mg once daily in one patient) were compared for their effects on bicycle exercise tolerance and their adverse effects in a randomized 2 x 4 week, double-blind, double-dummy crossover study. All patients had multivessel disease, 16 patients had occlusion of at least one vessel, and eight patients had a history of myocardial infarction. Two patients left the study during the initial nisoldipine period, one because of aggravation of the angina and the other because of suspected allergic reaction. Addition of nifedipine to atenolol treatment significantly improved the variables measured for severity of angina, such as time of exercise until 1 mm and 2 mm ST-segment depression, total exercise time and total workload. In contrast, no such improvement was noted after the addition of nisoldipine to atenolol. However, nisoldipine resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to the initiation of chest discomfort, the maximum heart rate, and the double product. In atenolol-treated patients with severe effort angina pectoris, nifedipine 20 mg tid improved exercise capacity, while nisoldipine 20 mg once daily did not have a similar effect.",

    "61": "A study of 43 elderly patients (60-74 years of age) with atherosclerotic hypertension revealed moderate disorders of the central and renal hemodynamics. The patients maintained adequately the main renal and endocrine functions (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system). Hypotensive treatment requires great care in these patients.

    "62": "Effects produced both by single intravenous drop-by-drop labetalol, 1 mg/kg (29 patients), sublingual obsidan, 20 mg (14 patients) and a 3-day course treatment with labetalol, 200-600 mg/day, and obsidan (80-160 mg/day) on systemic, intracardiac, and regional hemodynamics and oxygen supply of the body were comparatively studied in 43 patients in early periods of myocardial infarction. As compared with obsidan, labetalol caused favourable hemodynamic changes mostly pronounced in patients with concurrent arterial hypertension. The hemodynamic effects in arterial hypertension were found to come about by virtue of largely an alpha-adrenoblocking effect of the agent whereas in the absence of hypertension it was beneficial due to a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoblocking effect.", 
    "63": "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of dilevalol and captopril on blood pressure and heart rate in hypertensive subjects, both at rest and during bicycle exercise. Thirty mild hypertensive patients (24 men, 6 women), aged 34-55, were studied in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial. After a 3-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to receive either dilevalol (200 mg once daily) or captopril (50 mg twice daily) for 4 weeks. Dilevalol-treated patients whose diastolic blood pressure had not decreased by more than 8 mmHg from baseline (or to less than 95 mmHg) were given 400 mg once daily for a further 2 weeks. Treatment was stopped for all other patients. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured at rest and during bicycle exercise tests 4 (\"peak\") and 24 hours (\"trough\") after dosing in the dilevalol group and 4 (\"peak\") and 12 hours (\"trough\") after dosing in the captopril group. At the end of the placebo run-in, mean resting blood pressure was 156/102 mmHg in the dilevalol group and 157/103 in the captopril group. Six patients had blood pressure normalization with captopril and 9 with dilevalol 200 mg; a further 2 patients achieved normalized blood pressure levels with dilevalol 400 mg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The study indicated that both long-acting formulations were significantly better than placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (p less than 0.01). After 12 weeks there was a significantly lower (p = 0.03) frequency of migraine attacks in patients on the higher dose formulation than in those on the lower dose formulation. There was no significant difference in the frequency of side effects produced by the two formulations.", 
    "65": "The response of retinal arteries and veins to 3 months of antihypertensive medication was studied in 10 patients (39-56 years old) with essential hypertension. We used computerized microdensitometry on fundus photographs, a technique allowing for objective and simultaneous measures of the caliber of blood columns and the width and intensity of their central 'light reflex'. A moderate lowering of diastolic and systolic blood pressures (P less than 0.001) resulted in a significant reduction in the intensity of reflection from retinal arteries (38.6%; P less than 0.005). An increase in the width of the blood column (2.8%; n.s.) and the reflex (8.6%; n.s.) was indicated. Traditionally, changes in light reflectivity has been associated with arteriosclerosis of the vessel wall. The study shows, however, that the vascular reflex is most sensitive to changes in the systemic blood pressure. This signals a need for critical reviewal of interpretation and usefulness of classical grading systems of ophthalmoscopic signs of hypertensive retinopathy.", 
    "66": "From a randomized multicenter trial with metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction (n = 5778) we report on the outcome during a one-year follow-up in patients with confirmed infarction (n = 4106) in relation to whether or not they developed Q waves. Patients with Q waves had another pattern of risk factors, including lower age and a lower occurrence of previous infarction, angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure. After one year follow-up, 14.3% of the patients with Q waves had died versus 9.0% of those without Q waves (p less than 0.001). Reinfarction during the first year occurred in 8.2% of patients with Q waves and 12.5% of patients without Q waves (p less than 0.001). After one year, other morbidity aspects appeared relatively independent of the original presence of Q waves. In conclusion, during the first year after development of acute myocardial infarction the appearance of Q waves during the first three days is associated with a higher mortality and a lower reinfarction rate, whereas other morbidity aspects appear to be relatively independent of its presence.", 
    "67": "Effects of 4-aminomethyl-1-benzylpyrrolidin-2-one-hemifumarate (WEB 1881 FU), a novel pyrrolidinone nootropic, on acetylcholine (ACh) receptors and adrenoceptors were investigated using crude membranes of the rat brain. The affinity order of WEB 1881 FU was: M1-muscarinic (m) ACh receptor greater than M2-mACh receptor greater than alpha 2-adrenoceptor greater than beta-adrenoceptor greater than alpha 1-adrenoceptor greater than nicotinic ACh receptor. The WEB 1881 FU-competition curve for [3H]pirenzepine binding in hippocampal membranes was rightward-shifted by GTP gamma S; such behavior was also observed in the case of oxotremorine but not with scopolamine. The effects of long-term administration of WEB 1881 FU (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 21 days resulted in a significant decrease in the Bmax of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. In addition, the Bmax of [3H]pirenzepine binding to hippocampal and striatal membranes and that of [3H]AF-DX 116 binding to cerebellar membranes were significantly decreased as well. From these results, WEB 1881 FU seems to act on M1-mACh receptors, and its long-term administration probably induces the down-regulation of mACh receptors, mainly M1-mACh receptors in the hippocampus and striatum and M2-mACh receptors in the cerebellum.", 
    "68": "The present experiments studied the ontogeny of sympathetic control of the renin-angiotensin system by using pharmacological agents, which act at different levels of the sympathetic axis, to increase plasma renin activity (PRA) during the preweanling period in Sprague-Dawley rats. The selective beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist, prenalterol, produced age- and dose-dependent PRA increases. In 5- and 10-day-old animals, prenalterol treatment produced minimal stimulation of PRA and the dose-response curve was essentially flat. In contrast, greater PRA responses to increasing doses of prenalterol were found in 15- and 20-day-old animals. The PRA response to tyramine, which causes norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic fibers, gradually increased between 5 and 20 postnatal days of age, first producing significant stimulation on day 15. Centrally mediated sympathetic activation with yohimbine also produced age-dependent stimulation of PRA that was comparable to the increases produced by tyramine between postnatal days 10 and 20. However, in contrast to tyramine, yohimbine produced a significant increase in PRA on postnatal day 5. The present results suggest that functional sympathetic control of the renin-angiotensin system matures during the second to third postnatal week in the Sprague-Dawley rat, and this may be related to the development of beta-1 adrenoceptors in the kidney that regulate renin release.", 
    "69": "1. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and the tolerability of treatment with atenolol (50-100 mg once daily), nitrendipine (20-40 mg once daily) and their combination (atenolol 50 mg + nitrendipine 20 mg) once daily in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. 2. The study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled parallel groups design: blood pressures were measured at 'trough' effect (i.e. 24 h after dosing) to assess the adequacy of once-daily treatment. 3. Mean blood pressures (mm Hg) recorded on four occasions over 12 weeks of treatment were significantly lower both with atenolol (155/97 sitting: 155/104 standing) and with the combination of atenolol plus nitrendipine (153/96 sitting: 152/104 standing) than with placebo (169/108 sitting: 169/114 standing). Nitrendipine alone had no significant effect on blood pressure 24 h after dosing (165/104 sitting: 165/110 standing). 4. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were more common during treatment with nitrendipine: 7/32 of the patients experienced adverse effects attributable to intense systemic vasodilatation (e.g., flushing, erythema, headache). 2/37 patients taking atenolol were withdrawn: one because he developed a psoriatic rash and the other because of impaired peripheral circulation. Of the 35 patients taking combination treatment, two were withdrawn: one developed headaches and dyspnoea, and the other asthma. 5. The results suggest that once daily dosing with nitrendipine does not control blood pressure throughout the 24 h period in the majority of patients, and is associated with a considerable burden of adverse effects. Combination treatment was better tolerated but appeared to offer no advantages over atenolol alone in terms either of blood pressure control or adverse effects.", 
    "70": "The effects of hyperinsulinaemia imposed on normal rats on the subsequent insulin-responsiveness in vivo of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake of white adipose tissue and of various muscle types were investigated. This was done by treating normal rats with insulin via osmotic minipumps, and by comparing them with saline-infused controls. Hyperinsulinaemia produced by prior insulin treatment resulted in a well-tolerated hypoglycaemia. At the end of the treatment, the glucose utilization index of individual tissues was determined by euglycaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamps associated with the labelled 2-deoxy-D-glucose method. Prior insulin treatment resulted in increased insulin-responsiveness of the glucose utilization index of white adipose tissue, and in increased total lipogenesis in white adipose tissue and fat-pad weight. In contrast, prior insulin treatment resulted in a decreased glucose utilization index of several muscles. These opposite effects of hyperinsulinaemia on glucose utilization in white adipose tissue and muscles persisted when the hypoglycaemia-induced catecholamine output was prevented (adrenomedullectomy, propranolol treatment), as well as when hypoglycaemia was normalized by concomitant insulin treatment and glucose infusion. Insulin suppressed hepatic glucose production during the clamps in insulin-treated rats as in the respective controls, whereas total hepatic lipid synthesis and liver fat content were greater in rats treated with insulin than in controls. It is concluded that hyperinsulinaemia itself could be one of the driving forces responsible for producing increased glucose utilization by white adipose tissue, increased total lipid synthesis with fat accumulation in adipose tissue and the liver, together with an insulin-resistant state at the muscular level.", 
    "71": "Three hundred women with mild chronic hypertension at 6 to 13 weeks' gestation were randomly allocated to receive either methyldopa or labetalol or be in the control group. Thirty-seven women (12%) were excluded for various reasons. Of the remaining 263 patients, 90 received no drug, 87 received methyldopa, and 86 received labetalol. All 263 were followed throughout pregnancy with serial renal function tests and serial assessment of fetal status. There were no differences among the three groups in mean systolic or diastolic blood pressures, mean gestational age, or initial laboratory findings at time of entry. Patients treated with medications had significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout gestation compared with the no-medication group. Among the control group there was a spontaneously significant lowering (p less than 0.0001) of both systolic and diastolic blood pressures at 14 to 26 weeks' gestation. However, there were no differences among the three groups regarding the incidences of either superimposed preeclampsia (15.6%, 18.4%, and 16.3%, respectively), abruptio placentae (2.2%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively), or preterm delivery (10%, 12.5%, and 11.6%, respectively). In addition, there were no differences among the groups regarding gestational age at delivery, birth weight, incidence of fetal growth retardation, or neonatal head circumference. There was one midtrimester loss in the methyldopa group and one stillbirth in each of the other groups. We conclude that treatment of maternal blood pressure in mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy did not improve perinatal outcome.", 
    "72": "Penbutolol is a new beta-adrenergic blocking drug approved for the treatment of hypertension. It is a noncardioselective beta-blocker and has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The drug is approximately four times as potent as propranolol when taken orally. After oral administration, it is almost completely absorbed and peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 1.0 to 2.25 hours. Penbutolol is extensively metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation and glucuronidation. Active metabolites have not been identified. Only four to six percent of the parent drug is eliminated in the urine unchanged and dosage adjustment in renal insufficiency does not appear to be necessary. The mean terminal half-life of penbutolol is 17.6 to 26.5 hours. The duration of the hypotensive effect is approximately 24 hours. Current dosing guidelines recommend initiating therapy with 20 mg/d administered once a day. Optimum hypotensive effect occurs at dosages of 20-40 mg/d with little additional benefit observed above this range. Penbutolol appears to be well tolerated. The adverse effect profile is similar to other beta-blockers.", 
    "73": "The first Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto (GISSI) study showed striking evidence of the effectiveness and safety of intravenous thrombolytic treatment in acute myocardial infarction (MI). Since publication in The Lancet, the original report has become a reference work for every paper which deals with thrombolysis. In addition to GISSI's scientific value, these studies applied formal research to routine clinical practice outside of referral centers. Nearly all Italian CCUs took part in the GISSI projects, so that the results provide a profile of the patient who seeks care for acute MI in Italy. This wide data base allowed GISSI investigators to look into some relevant clinical events, eg, primary ventricular fibrillation, stroke, and in-hospital reinfarction. The GISSI-2 trial followed the GISSI-1 philosophy. The package of treatments recommended after extensive discussion with all the investigators (beta-blocker, aspirin, nitrates) was widely adopted. Now, only five years after the start of the GISSI-1, the overall mortality of Italian patients with acute MI has decreased from 13.0 percent to about 9 percent, and the number of patients with acute MI arriving in hospital within 1 h of the onset of symptoms has increased 50 percent. It is the wish of the GISSI investigators that this approach to treating acute MI will be regarded and acknowledged as their major contribution to the problem.", 
    "74": "Labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-blocking agent, was administered to 12 patients (mean age 55 years) with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to examine its effects on symptomatology and exercise performance. Studies were performed before treatment, after 8 weeks of placebo, and after 8 weeks of labetalol therapy in a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. The mean (+/- SEM) dose of labetalol for the group was 275 +/- 29 mg. Compared to treatment with placebo, the maximum duration of symptom-limited exercise was significantly prolonged with labetalol (580 +/- 72 seconds to 683 +/- 71 seconds; p less than 0.005). Both the resting and peak exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced. Ascending aortic blood flow velocity was also measured by continuous-wave Doppler technique during exercise. Compared to placebo, treatment with labetalol conferred no significant change in cardiac output at rest but significantly improved cardiac output at maximum exercise (14 +/- 3%; p less than 0.001). Doppler-derived peak aortic flow velocity, acceleration, and flow velocity integral were also significantly improved at maximum exercise. Systemic vascular resistance, as derived from mean blood pressure/cardiac output, was reduced by 12 +/- 3% and 16 +/- 3% at rest and at maximum exercise, respectively. New York Heart Association functional class was improved (3.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.2 +/- 0.3; p less than 0.005). No major side effects from labetalol were encountered. Thus labetalol improves symptomatology, exercise capacity, and exercise hemodynamics and reduces systemic vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.", 
    "75": "The high mortality of a first variceal bleed in cirrhotic patients even in very recent studies makes some effective form of primary prophylaxis desirable. Controlled studies of shunt and nonshunting surgery have shown that these operations can prevent variceal hemorrhage only at the expense of increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this type of surgery has no place in the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Liver transplantation, however, is becoming a real therapeutic alternative for many patients with chronic liver disease. Obviously, it will prevent bleeding in many patients, but primary prophylaxis of bleeding itself is not an indication for a transplant. The radically different results of randomized controlled trials of prophylactic sclerotherapy indicate that it is either very helpful and will save many lives or very harmful and will lead to death in patients who would otherwise survive. The cumulative evidence from the trials that took appropriate care of effective treatment for the acute bleed and that had no major problems with complications of the procedure itself suggests that prophylactic sclerotherapy is neither helpful nor very harmful. Thus, there is also no indication for prophylactic sclerotherapy in clinical routine. Personally, I even doubt that it should be used in future controlled trials in the light of the positive results of the prophylactic trials of beta-blockers. If there is an indication for prophylactic treatment, it should be the last invasive treatment available. In the near future, work should focus on the confirmation and further development of endoscopic or other simple and safe means to predict the risk of first bleeding; on the development and characterization of effective drugs; and on development of methods to identify at an early stage responders and nonresponders. If I presently had large varices that had not yet bled, I would like to join one of my senior colleagues and look for admission to the Control group of an ongoing randomized beta-blocker trial.", 
    "76": "We previously described a strong concordance between nocturnal oscillations in plasma renin activity and sleep cycles. To examine whether modifying renal renin content or release influences the response to central stimuli linked to sleep stage alternation, plasma renin activity was measured every 10 minutes from 11:00 PM to 8:00 AM in three groups of six subjects. The first group received one 40 mg dose of the diuretic furosemide; the second group underwent the night experiment after 3 days on a low sodium diet; the third group received one 100 mg dose of the beta-blocker atenolol. Each subject underwent a control night when a placebo was given. The nocturnal curves were analyzed with a pulse detection program. For the control nights, 74 of the 83 sleep cycles were associated with significant plasma renin activity oscillations; non-rapid eye movement sleep occurred in the ascending portions and rapid eye movement sleep in the declining portions of the oscillations. These oscillations persisted in the three groups of subjects during the experimental nights and the relation with the sleep stages was not disturbed. Acute stimulation by furosemide amplified the oscillations and led to a general upward trend of the nocturnal profiles. Similarly, a low sodium diet, which led to a slow increase in renal renin content, provoked large oscillations with high initial levels. However, in both cases the mean relative amplitude of the oscillations, expressed as a percentage of the nocturnal means, was similar to that of the control nights and approximated 60%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "Despite large gains in the medical and surgical treatment of angina pectoris in the past two decades, many patients are refractory to conventional medical therapy and are unsuitable for a first or, more commonly, repeat coronary revascularization procedure. We evaluated the efficacy of perhexiline maleate, a drug with an antianginal mechanism of action in humans that is as yet unknown, by using a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design in 17 patients with refractory angina who continued to receive maximal antianginal therapy, typically including nitrates, a beta-blocker, and a calcium channel antagonist. In view of perhexiline's potential for hepatic and neurological toxicity, plasma drug levels were monitored and maintained in the 150-600 ng/ml range. Sixty-three percent of patients were judged perhexiline responders by objective exercise testing criteria, as compared with 18% of patients on placebo (p less than 0.05). By blinded review of subjective measures of anginal frequency and severity, 65% of patients noted an improvement while on perhexiline, whereas no patient identified the placebo phase with improvement. Side effects observed in 29% of patients were minor and related to transient elevations of blood levels of more than 600 ng/ml; no patient suffered hemodynamic or cardiac conduction abnormalities attributable to perhexiline. With attention to the pharmacokinetics of perhexiline's elimination in individual patients, this novel antianginal agent seems to be safe and effective and deserves further evaluation in patients already receiving maximal antianginal therapy who are not candidates for revascularization procedures.", 
    "78": "Noradrenaline injected into cerebral lateral ventricles was found to change the temperature homeostasis in white rats. The fall of rectal temperature, the rise of brown adipose tissue temperature and oxygen consumption occurred within 25-30 min after the injection. Preliminary adaptation to cold increased the effect of noradrenaline. The beta-adrenergic blockade of cerebral structures by propranolol altered the noradrenaline effect: both the rise of brown adipose tissue temperature and the oxygen consumption increase do not occur. This effect is more obvious in cold-adapted animals. The adaptation to cold seems to increase the sensitivity of central adrenergic structures to noradrenaline, central beta-adrenoreceptors being mainly responsible for the effect of noradrenaline (the rise of brown adipose tissue temperature and the oxygen consumption increase) on the thermoregulation.", 
    "79": "Effects of i.v. administration of cholino- and adrenergic blocking agents on limbic-sympathetic discharges of L2-L3 white rami, evoked by stimulation of the anterior, visceral area of the limbic cortex and on arterial blood pressure were studied in anesthetized cats. M- and N-cholinoreceptor blocking agents atropine and ganglerone do not induce any apparent changes in limbic-sympathetic discharge and the blood pressure level. Beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agent propranolol evoked a small fall of the blood pressure with no apparent changes of limbic-sympathetic discharges. Alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking agent phenotolamine evoked obvious drop of the blood pressure and, in two out of eight experiments, a marked increase of the amplitude of limbic-sympathetic evoked discharges. Neurochemical regulatory mechanism of limbic-spinal sympathetic activity are discussed.", 
    "80": "1. Plasma renin concentration (PRC) and plasma and pulmonary angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) concentration were measured in fetal and neonatal guinea-pigs from 45 days gestational age (GA) until 21 days post-partum. 2. Fetal PRC increased towards term to reach values greater than those measured in normal adult males. Pentobarbitone anaesthesia of the mother resulted in significant elevation of fetal PRC after 66 days GA but not before this time. 3. PRC were very high in the newborn guinea-pig, decreased rapidly during the first 24 h after birth and then more gradually, to reach approximately adult values by day 21. 4. Fetal plasma ACE concentration increased towards term to reach values greater than those measured in adult males and decreased subsequently. 5. Pulmonary ACE concentrations were very low throughout gestation but increased considerably between days 3 and 14 post-partum. Low concentrations of ACE were measured in other fetal tissues but placental concentrations were relatively high. 6. Propranolol (0.1 mg I.P.) or saline was administered (under halothane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia) to fetuses of litters of various GA from 55 days to term. Fetal PRC were measured 3 h later. Propranolol treatment resulted in significantly lower fetal PRC than saline treatment in litters aged 63 days to term but not in younger litters. 7. These data indicate that the renin-angiotensin system is functional in the fetal guinea-pig during the last third of gestation. Fetal plasma renin concentrations near term are greater than those measured in normal adult males. This may, in part, reflect an increased influence of the fetal sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "81": "Peripheral nerve injury by chronic compression caused a decrease in conductive velocity or a delay in the transmission of the action potential, later blocking it completely following demyelination of the damaged nerve region. Abnormal firing activities were recorded from the injured peripheral nerve fibers after the 6-7th postoperative day. There were different patterns of abnormal firing from fibers. Regular tonic ectopic firings with high frequency were always recorded from A beta fibers. A delta/C fibers, however, had burst or irregular spikes. A single antidromic shock to the damaged region sometimes induced ectopic spikes following the expected one. The demyelinated region of the damaged nerve was very sensitive to both tetraethylammonium, a K+ channel blocker, and noradrenaline. The authors suggest that new ion channels or receptors, absent in normal, form in the damaged region.", 
    "82": "Immune abnormalities, including deficient CD8 lymphocyte-mediated suppression, have been implicated in the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS). The peripheral sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system innervates the lymphoid organs and affects immune function. Animals with an ablated sympathetic nervous system develop more severe experimental allergic encephalomyelitis than control animals and exhibit an increased density of beta-adrenergic receptors on their lymphocytes. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis shares many features with MS. Accordingly, we investigated the psychogalvanic skin reflex in patients with rapidly progressive MS and found that 13 patients (57%) lacked this sympathetic-mediated response. The density of beta-adrenergic receptors on lymphocyte subsets was increased in progressive MS, most notably on the CD8 suppressor/cytotoxic subset. B lymphocytes had the greatest number of receptors with 12.1 +/- 1.8 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 18.7 +/- 2.6 fmol/10(6) cells in patients with MS. CD8 lymphocytes possessed an intermediate number of receptors with 3.4 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 9.1 +/- 1.6 fmol/10(6) cells in patients with MS. CD4 lymphocytes demonstrated the fewest receptors with 1.2 +/- 0.1 fmol/10(6) cells in control subjects and 1.8 +/- 0.4 fmol/10(6) cells in patients with MS. No differences in the affinity or function (cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in response to 10(-5) M (-)isoproterenol) of the adrenergic receptor were found when patients with progressive MS and control subjects were compared. Autonomic abnormalities in progressive MS and the increased beta-adrenergic receptor density found on CD8 lymphocytes may be related.", 
    "83": "Excitation propagation is mediated by the brief opening of voltage-dependent Na-channels in the plasma membranes of cells of the conduction system and working myocardium. The refractory period is a function of the re-availability of the Na-channel for renewed opening. Most antiarrhythmic agents block cardiac Na-channels and, consequently, affect the desired refractory period prolongation. At the same time, however, dependent on the concentration and the substance, they slow conduction; an effect which can facilitate reentry excitation in the injured heart. The Na-channel blocking drugs, class I antiarrhythmic agents, are distinguished from the beta-receptor blockers, class II, repolarizing prolonging drugs, class III, and the cardiac Ca-channel blocking drugs (class IV) (Table 1). MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF THE CARDIAC NA-CHANNEL: Voltage-dependent Na-channels which have been structurally elucidated to date are glycoprotein macromolecules of about 2000 amino acids with a molecular weight of about 260,000. Beginning at the amino terminal, four consecutive homologous domains can be differentiated which are composed of six transmembranous segments each. The terminal portion of the chain as well as the connecting segments between the domains appear intracellular. There are important relationships between the molecular structure and the function of the Na-channel (Figure 1). On comparison of the primary structures of neuronal and cardiac Na-channels, domains I to IV as well as the connecting segment between domains III and IV, are nearly identical. Homology in all of the remaining molecular regions, in contrast, is less than 70%. These segments as well as the differing structure of the four S5-S6 connecting chains may be responsible for the varying functional response of the cardiac Na-channels. MOLECULAR SITE OF ACTION OF ANTIARRHYTHMIC AGENTS AT THE CARDIAC NA-CHANNEL: Since most antiarrhythmic agents are weak bases with pK values between 7.5 and 9.5, in the physiologic range of pH, they are present in part in the protonated, positively-charged form, in part as uncharged free base. It is assumed that the Na-channel of nerve and skeletal muscle has one receptor for local anesthetics at which both the protonated and the uncharged molecular forms bind. The receptor is thought to be located on the inner wall of the ion pore about half of the distance between the intracellular and the extracellular channel opening. The uncharged form of the Na-channel blocker penetrates directly from the lipid phase of the surrounding cell membrane, the protonated form only from the intracellular space during the short opening of the channel at the beginning of the action potential. Through binding on the receptor, the Na-channel is blocked. Dissociation of the molecular forms takes place in the same manner. The peptide region on which antiarrhythmic drugs bind, however, has not been identified. By means of the patch-clamp technique, it has been shown that on extracellular application of the quaternary lidocaine derivative QX-314 there is a rapid and marked reduction of Na-flux in cardiac Purkinje fibers in contrast to the effects at neuronal and skeletal muscle Na-channels. Intracellular application similarly leads to blockade but only in the course of repetitive depolarizations indicating that the cardiac Na-channel may have a second binding site for local anesthetics at the extracellular side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "84": "1. The influence of long-acting propranolol and of atenolol on the circadian rhythm of heart rate was assessed using 24 h electrocardiographic recordings in elderly patients with essential hypertension. Eighteen elderly patients were investigated before treatment and after 12 weeks on 60 mg of long-acting propranolol once a day; 21 elderly patients were studied before treatment and after 12 weeks on 50 mg of atenolol once a day. The mean hourly heart rate in 24 h electrocardiographic recordings was used to fit cosine curves by the statistical technique of least squares, and the following parameters were estimated: mesor (rhythm-adjusted mean of the heart rate), amplitude (one-half of the total diurnal variation of the heart rate) and acrophase (the time when the heart rate was at its peak above the mean). 2. The cosine curves were fitted with a P value of 0.01 or less before and after treatment in all patients. 3. In the long-acting propranolol group, the mesor and amplitude were reduced significantly after treatment. The acrophase appeared significantly earlier after treatment than before treatment. 4. In the atenolol group, the mesor and amplitude decreased significantly after treatment. However, the acrophase did not change with treatment. 5. We conclude that both propranolol and atenolol decrease the mesor and amplitude through blocking cardiac beta 1-receptors, and that only propranolol may have some effects on the central nervous system, resulting in the circadian phase shift.", 
    "85": "In this paper we validate a methodology, ligand autoradiographic receptor screening (LARS), for detecting expression of full length receptor cDNAs in COS cells. The method involves transfection of COS cells with receptor cDNAs by spheroplast fusion, production of filter replicas of the cell fragments, ligand binding to the receptors expressed in the membranes, and autoradiographic detection of bound ligand. A beta-adrenergic receptor cDNA cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector reliably induces high levels of beta-adrenergic receptor expression in 2-12% of COS cell colonies transfected with this plasmid after experimental conditions are optimized. Receptor expression is monitored by autoradiographic detection of 125iodocyanopindolol binding to COS cell fragments immobilized on polyester filter replicas. Binding displays appropriate pharmacological properties. The number of high-density binding spots per filter depends on the fraction of the spheroplasts in the fusion mixture that contain the beta-adrenergic receptor cDNA. A 100-plate LARS experiment can assess receptor expression in more than 10(4) transfected colonies. Thus detection of receptor-encoding sequences present in libraries in proportions as low as 1 in 10(4) should be possible. This technique may therefore be useful in detecting expression of other receptor cDNAs for which selective radioligands are available.", 
    "86": "The present study examined the effect of histamine on the secretion of phosphatidylcholine, the predominant component of pulmonary surfactant from adult rat alveolar type II pneumocytes in primary culture. Histamine stimulated surfactant secretion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 10 microM, histamine stimulated surfactant release by 5.2-fold over the basal secretory rate. The concentration producing half the maximal response for histamine-induced secretion was 70 nM. Histamine-induced secretion was blocked by both the selective histamine1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine and the selective histamine2 receptor antagonist cimetidine, but not by the beta-adrenergic antagonist alprenolol. Histamine activated adenylate cyclase and intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production. These effects on adenylate cyclase and cAMP induced by histamine were inhibited by the H2 antagonist cimetidine. This would suggest that surfactant secretion was stimulated by histamine through H2 receptors and by cAMP. When histamine and isoproterenol were added concomitantly, the effects on phosphatidylcholine secretion were additive; however, there was no additive effect on adenylate cyclase activation. This coupled with H2 antagonist pyrilamine inhibition of histamine-induced secretion would suggest that histamine stimulated surfactant secretion through another mechanism in addition to a cAMP-dependent mechanism.", 
    "87": "To study the epigenetic regulation of beta adrenergic receptor subtypes, we examined the effects of phorbol esters on beta adrenergic receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, which express both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptor subtypes. Pretreatment of intact 3T3-L1 cells with the protein kinase C activator phorbol dibutyrate caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in subsequent cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation mediated by the beta adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. This effect was selective for beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated responses because there was a potentiation of cAMP accumulation caused by other activators such as prostaglandin E1, forskolin or cholera toxin. The inactive phorbol, alpha-phorbol dibutyrate was ineffective at 1 microM in attenuating isoproterenol stimulation, and 25 nM of the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine blocked the effects of phorbol ester on beta adrenergic agonist responses. Stimulation of cAMP accumulation by isoproterenol occurred through a greater proportion of beta-2 adrenergic receptors in phorbol dibutyrate-treated cells than in control cells. This was demonstrated using the beta-1 adrenergic selective antagonist ICI 89.406 and the beta-2 adrenergic selective antagonist ICI 118.551 to inhibit competitively isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor number and subtype in these cells are regulated by glucocorticoids and butyrate. Decreasing the proportion of beta-1 adrenergic receptors and concomitantly increasing beta-2 adrenergic receptors with either glucocorticoids or butyrate decreased the ability of phorbol ester pretreatment to attenuate cAMP accumulation by isoproterenol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Experimental studies indicate the importance of both the alpha and beta components of the adrenergic nervous system in the development and reversal of LVH. Therefore labetalol (L), a combined alpha and beta blocker, and propranolol (P), a nonselective beta blocker, were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 35 hypertensive patients with echocardiographic evidence of LVH. Following 2 weeks of placebo, L or P was titrated as needed and tolerated to maximum total daily doses of 1600 mg and 640 mg, respectively. A thiazide diuretic was added if necessary for blood pressure control. M-mode echocardiograms were performed at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of blood pressure control. The echocardiograms were read independently by two blinded observers for end-diastolic dimension and wall thicknesses, and left ventricular mass. Fractional shortening, cardiac output, and peripheral vascular resistance were derived using standard formulas. Both drugs reduced blood pressure significantly and comparably. Significant changes in the echocardiographic measurements were observed as early as 1 month and usually persisted throughout the study. Both drugs decreased posterior wall thickness; however, only the decrease in propranolol group achieved statistical significance. Septal wall thickness was reduced by L at 3 and 12 months. End-diastolic dimension increased significantly in the L-treated group at 3, 6, and 12 months of therapy, whereas P had no effect on this measurement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "The relationship between propranolol and depression is a subject of controversy. Numerous case reports suggest that propranolol can cause depression, but two small prospective trials have failed to confirm this. The contemporary psychiatric literature is divided as to whether propranolol can cause depression. This study addresses this issue by re-analyzing side effect data from clinical trials of propranolol as an antihypertensive agent. A literature review was carried out and the data were analyzed using meta-analytic statistical techniques. Propranolol was found to cause depression as a side effect with a statistically greater frequency than the control medications used in these trials. As other side effects of propranolol include fatigue, diminished energy, decreased libido, anorexia and poor concentration, it is suggested that propranolol is a cause of organic mood disorder, depressed type.", 
    "90": "The diabetogenic agent streptozotocin (STZ) was injected intraperitoneally in Long-Evans and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-deficient Brattleboro rats. Twenty-eight days later both strains had a bradycardia and systolic hypotension; STZ-treated Brattleboro rats also had diastolic hypotension. The vasopressin (V1-receptor) antagonist, d(CH2)5[Tyr(Et)]DAVP, had no effect on resting blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) in either strain of rat, indicating the relative maintenance of diastolic BP in STZ-treated Long-Evans rats was not dependent on acute vascular actions of AVP. Captopril caused a modest hypotension in all groups of rats, indicating that BP was not differentially dependent on the renin-angiotensin system in the different groups. In the presence of captopril and the ganglion blocker, pentolinium tartrate, the AVP-mediated recovery in BP was impaired in STZ-treated Long-Evans rats. During administration of d(CH2)5[Tyr(Et)]DAVP and pentolinium, the angiotensin II (ANG II)-mediated BP recovery was smaller in both groups of STZ-treated rats, indicating that this abnormality was not likely to be caused by inhibition of renin release by AVP. The abnormalities in ANG II- and AVP-mediated recovery were prevented by insulin treatment.", 
    "91": "Dopamine (DA) is synthesized in the renal proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and may act as a paracrine substance at tubular DA-1 receptors to decrease sodium transport. Although DA-1 receptors have been identified in rabbit renal PCT by use of nonselective dopaminergic radioligands, DA-1 receptors have not been localized in specific nephron segments with the use of selective DA-1 radioligands. In these studies we used a novel DA-1 dopaminergic ligand 125I-SCH-23982, which has been shown to have a high affinity for brain and renal DA-1 receptors, to identify DA-1 receptors in the rat renal PCT and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). DA-1 receptors in the microdissected PCT and DCT were studied by a quantitative autoradiographic technique and by measuring adenylate cyclase (AC) activity. No specific 125I-SCH-23982 binding could be measured in the DCT indicating the absence of DA-1 receptors in this segment. Binding of 125I-SCH-23982 to PCT was saturable with time and radioligand concentration and was stereoselective. Saturation isotherm analysis in control rats yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 7.5 +/- 0.14 nM (n = 4) and a maximum receptor density (Bmax) of 0.69 +/- 0.04 pmol/mg protein (n = 4). The rank-order potency for agonist and antagonist displacement of 125I-SCH-23982 binding was consistent for DA-1 receptors: SCH-23390 greater than fenoldopam = SKF 38393 greater than SCH-23388. The stimulatory effect of the DA-1 agonist fenoldopam (10 microM) on AC activity was blocked by the DA-1 antagonist SCH-23390 (10 microM) but not by the beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-propranolol (10 microM), indicating specificity. The DA-beta-hydroxylase blocker, SKF 102698, increased renal DA concentrations threefold, reduced the PCT DA-1 receptor Bmax by 33%, and abolished the stimulatory effect of 10 microM fenoldopam on AC activity in the PCT but had no effect on Kd. It is concluded that DA-1 receptors are present in rat PCT but not DCT and can be regulated by renal DA.", 
    "92": "In a multicenter study, the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) labetalol for the control of elevated blood pressure were studied in the intensive care unit (ICU) in 65 patients within 4 hours following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients with pre-existing ventricular dysfunction, bradycardia, bronchospastic disease, or postoperative complications were excluded. All patients were monitored with a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter. Entry criteria were a systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mm Hg for at least five minutes. Intravenous labetalol was loaded incrementally (5, 10, 20, and 40 mg at 10-minute intervals) to a maximum cumulative dose of 75 mg, until either SBP decreased 10% or DBP decreased 10% and was less than 90 mm Hg. Responders were entered into a 6-hour maintenance period, and received 5 to 40 mg of IV labetalol every 10 minutes as needed for blood pressure control. Hemodynamic data and temperature were recorded at baseline, just before each dose of labetalol during the loading period, and at the end of the maintenance period. Alternative therapy was given in the case of nonresponse or adverse events. Intravenous labetalol successfully controlled post-CABG hypertension in 55 of 65 patients (85%); of these, 46 responded to 35 mg or less. Although 28 patients required no further labetalol in the maintenance period, in the others dosage varied from 5 to 400 mg. Reductions in SBP and DBP were associated with moderate reductions in pulse pressure (SBP-DBP) and heart rate (HR). Cardiac index decreased by 18.5%, with a 12.5% decrease in stroke index and 8.1% decrease in HR. Systemic vascular resistance did not increase significantly. Four patients (6%) developed hypotension related to IV labetalol. There was one death due to perioperative myocardial infarction, which was unrelated to labetalol use. The mechanism of action of IV labetalol in controlling hypertension after CABG surgery seems to be moderate negative inotropy and chronotropy. Its alpha-blocking effects seem to be important in preventing reflex vasoconstriction. This is directly opposite to the primary vasodilator effect found when IV labetalol is used to control nonsurgical hypertension. Because of these actions, labetalol should be avoided or used with caution in patients with preoperative and postoperative cardiac dysfunction. In patients with normal left ventricular function, IV labetalol appears to be a safe, effective agent in controlling post-CABG hypertension, with the added potential benefit of enhanced myocardial oxygen balance.", 
    "93": "The effects of treatment with dl, d- or l-propranolol (subcutaneously for 1 week) on arterial blood pressure and on 6-keto prostaglandin (PG) F1 alpha (stable metabolite of PGI2) and PGE2 production by aorta, renal medulla and renal cortex were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats. dl-Propranolol and l-propranolol significantly (P less than .05) lowered blood pressures from 148 +/- 9/113 +/- 5 (n = 6) and 133 +/- 4/100 +/- 2 (n = 12) mm Hg to 112 +/- 3/80 +/- 3 and 121 +/- 3/81 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively. Comparable treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with inactive d-propranolol was without effect. Basal immunoreactive (i) i6-keto-PGF1 alpha and iPGE2 production by isolated aorta, renal medulla and cortex was not different in vehicle compared to the dl-propranolol-treated rats. In contrast, norepinephrine (1 microM)-stimulated synthesis of i6-keto PGF1 alpha and iPGE2 by the aorta in the dl-propranolol-treated group was significantly (P less than .05) enhanced compared with the vehicle-treated group. Aortic i6-keto-PGF1 alpha and iPGE2 synthesis stimulated by norepinephrine in l-propranolol-treated rats was also significantly (P less than .05) higher than that observed in vehicle and d-propranolol-treated rats. dl-Propranolol treatment did not alter norepinephrine-stimulated renal cortical or medullary i6-keto-PGF1 alpha or iPGE2 synthesis. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.p.) given on the last 2 days of dl-propranolol treatment, significantly inhibited aortic i6-keto-PGF1 alpha and iPGE2 production and blunted the antihypertensive effect of dl-propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "The association of Q-T interval prolongation, syncope and sudden death is known as the long Q-T syndrome. The syndrome may be familial, associated with congenital deafness, or idiopathic. The diagnosis is based on the electrocardiographic finding of a prolonged Q-T interval with or without T wave abnormalities. In this article, we present a nine-year-old boy admitted to the Hacettepe University Children's Hospital with complaints of syncopal episodes. The prolonged Q-T syndrome was diagnosed as the cause of the syncopal attacks. In addition, the same syndrome was detected in his father. The prolonged Q-T syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with recurrent, unexplained syncope in the pediatric age group.", 
    "95": "The effects of a 12-week treatment with acebutolol on serum lipids have been studied in 18 patients. Acebutolol was given as a 400-, 600-, or 800-mg single daily dose in the morning. Standing and supine blood pressure diminished significantly, whereas the major indexes of lipid metabolism such as total serum cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and plasma lipoproteins were not significantly affected. The treatment was well tolerated.", 
    "96": "A open study with increasing doses of bopindolol, a nonselective beta-blocker of long half-life has been carried out in patients with mild and moderate hypertension in order to assess the efficacy and security of the treatment in short and long term. Twenty patients (22 women and 8 men) were included with the ranging ages from 36 to 62 years old (x +/- SD 51.6 +/- 7.6) whose blood pressures were higher than 160 mm Hg for the systolic value and between 90 and 125 mm Hg for the diastolic (x +/- SD 165 +/- 7.2 and 102.6 +/- 6.7 respectively). Nineteen from the twenty patients (95%) responded satisfactorily after 20 weeks of oral bopindolol treatment once a day showing significative statistical differences on forth week of the treatment versus blood pressure rates of placebo's period. Similar results were obtained with regard to the cardiac frequency. HDL cholesterol rates increased significantly as well as the ratio HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol.", 
    "97": "Beta-blockings in collyrium are much used in ophthalmology, in the treatment of chronic glaucoma with open angle, because they decrease the OT with 25-30%. They are well accepted, but have systemic effects. The collyria are drained by the lacrimal system and 80% of the product is absorbed by the nasal mucosa. If the active substance penetrates into the circulatory system, avoiding hepatic metabolization, it reaches the target organs in a rather considerable amount and leads sometimes to adverse effects, as a consequence of blockage of the specific receptors. Although these effects are not frequent in the usual practice, they might decompensate a poor cardiac or respiratory function. The physician has to take into account the cardio-respiratory state of the patients and to recommend concomitantly drugs that lower the myocardial conduction or contractibility.", 
    "98": "Retrospective experience with drug therapy in 747 patients with essential hypertension registered from 1972-1983 is reported. Five hundred patients were seen between 1972 to 1978 and 247 between 1979-1983; the latter group was characterised by the use of beta blockers as first line drugs. Hypertension was graded according to level of diastolic blood pressure as mild, moderate and moderately severe or severe in 423, 211, and 113 patients, respectively. The overall response to treatment at 6 months was satisfactory in 66.2% of mild, 50.2% of moderate and 58.4% of severe grades of hypertension. A large number of patients in both the groups having varying grades of severity needed at least 2 to 3 drugs for the control of hypertension. The side effects of drugs were generally mild which included general weakness with diuretics; skin rash, nasal congestion and pruritus with methyldopa; cold extremities with beta blockers and palpitations with prazosin.", 
    "99": "In patients with hypertension persisting on combined diuretic and beta-blocker therapy, the effects of an additional 9-week therapy with a calcium antagonist (nifedipine) versus a classical arterial vasodilator (hydralazine) were compared for changes in blood pressure (BP), plasma catecholamines (n = 15), and left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function (n = 6). Both drugs lowered BP, but nifedipine was significantly more effective in lowering systolic BP. Hydralazine increased both supine and standing plasma norepinephrine, nifedipine increased them only in the standing position and to a lesser extent. Patients on beta1-selective (n = 5) versus nonselective (n = 10) blockade showed similar responses. Left ventricular systolic function was not affected by hydralazine, whereas nifedipine increased the rate of ejection. In contrast, LV diastolic function was not affected by nifedipine, whereas hydralazine improved the peak filling rate. We conclude that arterial vasodilation by a calcium antagonist causes less sympathetic activation than caused by a classical arterial vasodilator. However, during short-term therapy in patients already on a diuretic and a beta blocker, nifedipine appears not to improve decreased LV diastolic function.", 
    "100": "The interaction of the new beta-receptor antagonist tertatolol with rifampicin and ranitidine was investigated in ten patients with arterial hypertension (WHO stages I-II). They were treated orally with a single dose of tertatolol 5 mg alone and, after randomized allocation, with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily or rifampicin 600 mg once daily for 1 week each (tertatolol 5 mg was concurrently administered on the seventh day of the treatment phases). Following each therapeutic phase, circadian blood pressure values as well as kinetic parameters were obtained. On treatment with tertatolol alone, maximum plasma concentrations were 123.7 +/- 32.4 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) and were reached after 1.95 +/- 1.77 hours. The tertatolol elimination half-life was 9.0 +/- 7.1 hours. Coadministration of ranitidine did not significantly alter the kinetic parameters and antihypertensive effect of tertatolol. Rifampicin, however, decreased the maximum plasma levels of tertatolol to 80.6 +/- 18.5 ng/ml and markedly shortened the elimination half-life to 3.4 +/- 2.6 hours (p less than 0.01 compared with tertatolol alone). Urinary excretion of parent tertatolol and unchanged 4-hydroxy tertatolol was decreased under rifampicin, and a tendency to a reduction in the effect of tertatolol on circadian blood pressure values was observed. Twenty-four hours after administration, the heart rate in those patients on tertatolol alone (68 +/- 6 beats/min) was lower than in those on tertatolol plus rifampicin (74 +/- 7 beats/min). In conclusion, a pronounced pharmacokinetic interaction, with a limited consequence in terms of pharmacodynamic effects, was found in the present study when tertatolol was administered with rifampicin, but not with ranitidine.", 
    "101": "The possibility to use adreno- and ganglionic blockaders in the operative period in surgical patients with initial hypotension is considered. The examinations performed in 37 patients have shown that addition of adreno- and ganglionic blockaders to routine correcting therapy results in earlier (after premedication) and more economical (at the expense of elevation of the initial low peripheral vascular resistance) arrest of the initial hypotonia.", 
    "102": "NIDDM and hypertension are both characterized by insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia. In IDDM, factors associated with nephropathy produce hypertension. To avoid exacerbation of the metabolic condition, and to prevent further deterioration in glycemic control, treatment of hypertension in the diabetic patient should include the administration of medication with the fewest adverse effects on glucose homeostasis. If diuretics are to be used, it appears that loop diuretics may be preferable to the thiazides or potassium-sparing compounds. Among the remaining classes of antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors may be the agents of choice because of their potential positive effects on insulin sensitivity and renal function, and their lack of severe adverse side-effects."
