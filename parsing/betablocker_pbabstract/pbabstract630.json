There was transitory hypoxaemia and compensated renal insufficiency. After forced diuresis and transfusions the patient slowly recovered. The only residual defect is arterial hypertension which requires treatment.", 
    "1": "Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a congenital disease which as its name suggests, runs intermittently. Biochemically it is characterised by over-production of hepatic ALA synthetase (ALA-s), inducible mitochondrial enzyme and an increase in prophyrinic precursors (PBG, ac S-ALA). Clinically it is characterised by an abdominal nervous symptomatology. The primary metabolic error has been identified as a deficiency in enzyme activity which partially blocks haem biosynthesis. During the appearance of clinical manifestations, certain factors are present which have the capacity of inducing hepatic ALA-s production in vitro. Apart from some preventive measures treatment is mainly of symptomatology and complications. More recently the use of ALA-s inhibitors has been introduced.", 
    "2": "This paper is a brief review of the problems associated with drug therapy in the elderly. Although the elderly are more prone to suffer adverse reactions to drugs and to respond abnormally, impaired drug handling should not be blamed for these problems until other factors have been evaluated. Renal function deteriorates as people grow older, but the absorption, metabolism and distribution of most drugs may not be adversely affected by advancing age. Evidence to the contrary is sometimes based on studies of convalescent patients in whom an effect of disease or drug therapy cannot be excluded. For an assessment of the effects of aging on the pharmacokinetics of oxprenolol, 2 groups of 8 healthy females, mean age 21 and 68 years, respectively, were studied. Oxprenolol, 80 mg, was given orally in a single dose on day 1 and day 8 of a course of treatment; on the intervening days, oxprenolol, 80 mg, was given twice daily. The mean plasma concentration:time curves for both day 1 and day 8 for the 2 age groups were comparable. Thus, age alone does not affect the pharmacokinetics of oxprenolol.", 
    "3": "Data from 6 controlled clinical trials of oxprenolol carried out in the United States were reviewed to determine the efficacy and tolerability of oxprenolol in patients aged greater than or equal to 55 years. All study designs but 1 called for dosage to be increased to a maximum of 480 mg/day. In a 10-week trial of oxprenolol versus placebo given twice daily, oxprenolol reduced diastolic pressure by 8 mm Hg, while placebo reduced it by 3 mm Hg. A comparison of once-daily with twice-daily dosing showed similar results for both groups: -12/-6 mm Hg for once-daily and -9/-8 mm Hg for twice-daily. There were 2 short-term studies comparing oxprenolol and placebo, both given in addition to hydrochlorothiazide. In the first, the change in blood pressure with oxprenolol was -18/-14 mm Hg and with placebo was +6/-3 mm Hg; only 3 of 14 patients receiving oxprenolol received a maximal dosage. In the follow-up study, most of the dosages were titrated to maximum; reductions were -9/-9 mm Hg with oxprenolol treatment and 0/-12 mm Hg with placebo. Two long-term studies compared oxprenolol and propranolol, also as combination therapy with hydrochlorothiazide. In the 14-week study, the reduction in blood pressure was slightly better with oxprenolol: -15/-15 versus -12/-11 mm Hg. In the 27-week study, almost half of the patients in the oxprenolol group received the maximal dosage. Blood pressure was reduced 2 or 3 mm Hg less with oxprenolol than with propranolol. Oxprenolol was well tolerated in the elderly; it produced a low incidence of typical beta-blocker side effects even when given in a once-daily regimen.", 
    "4": "Double-blind, randomized, parallel-group studies have confirmed that oxprenolol, either alone or in combination with a thiazide, is effective in reducing elevated blood pressure. In 2 of 3 comparisons with placebo, the blood pressure reduction was significantly more effective with oxprenolol; in 1 study, even though the placebo response was pronounced, oxprenolol was still more effective than placebo. In 2 studies propranolol reduced blood pressure by about 2 mm Hg more than oxprenolol. In the larger, longer-term study this difference was significant at the end of the dose-titration period, but there were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups at study end. Moreover, oxprenolol reduced heart rate less and was associated with fewer side effects. Oxprenolol effectively lowered blood pressure when given once daily and was well tolerated, even in large doses. Blood pressure was reduced less with oxprenolol than with hydrochlorothiazide, -14/-11 versus -20/-13 mm Hg. The mean reduction with oxprenolol was less for black patients than for white. In a 1-year safety study, 86% of the patients continued to have a diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg at study end.", 
    "5": "Oxprenolol is a potent noncardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug with partial agonist activity of proved efficacy and high tolerability in patients at risk of various cardiovascular disease syndromes. The drug rapidly relieves angina and attenuates the electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia. It is a potent antihypertensive drug that not only reduces the blood pressure at rest but also prevents the surges associated with exercise and psychic stress. Oxprenolol has substantial benefit in the alleviation of many of the somatic sequelae of psychic stress and anxiety. The drug also suppresses the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of cigarette smoking. In the field of primary prevention, oxprenolol has attributes that could be expected to reduce the long-term cardiovascular complications of high blood pressure. In the secondary prevention, it reduces the further incidence of sudden death in patients in whom administration is started in relatively small doses within a few weeks after acute myocardial infarction. In the 15 years that the drug has been available for clinical prescription, it has established a reputation for high clinical tolerability.", 
    "6": "Oxprenolol is clinically a well-established beta blocker that shares with other members of this group the ability to control a variety of disorders, in particular, hypertension and angina. Pharmacologically it is a nonselective beta blocker that possesses partial agonist activity (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity). Pharmacokinetically, oxprenolol behaves as a moderately lipophilic agent. This means that it is well absorbed, but then undergoes considerable first-pass loss. It penetrates well into most tissues, including the central nervous system. About 80% of oxprenolol is bound to protein in the blood, and when acute-phase proteins increase, as, for example, in patients with inflammatory disease, total plasma concentrations of oxprenolol also increase. Apart from this, the plasma concentration:time profile produced after the oral administration of oxprenolol is remarkably consistent and reproducible. Intrasubject and intersubject variability is small, and the administration of the drug after food or with many other drugs has very little effect. The beta-blocking effects of oxprenolol correlate well with the plasma concentrations, but as with other beta blockers, it has not been possible to correlate plasma concentrations directly with its therapeutic actions such as lowering blood pressure or controlling arrhythmias.", 
    "7": "Renal function was assessed through clearance studies in man under initial conditions marked by retention (23 experiments) and hydro-saline depletion (19 experiments). Further evaluations were carried out in depletion combined with treatment with (+/-)-propranolol (9 experiments) or with prazosin (9 experiments). In each study, clearance was checked during and after venous infusion of 0.1 micrograms/kg-1/min-1 DA, in addition to the control clearance. Adrenolytic drugs and renal function in hydro-saline depletion. Combination with propranolol had no significant effect on renal function, whereas prazosin led to a significant increase in both total and afferent renal vascular resistance; the flow rate and filtrate were less despite higher arterial pressure. Both the absolute and the percentage loading value of isosmotic and anisosmotic sodium reabsorption were inhibited. Renal action of DA in depletion with and without adrenolytic drugs. DA failed to produce either vasodilatation or a hydro-natriuretic effect during hydro-saline depletion, by contrast with its effect at the same dose during retention. During its infusion, however, it led to sodium saving dependent on stimulation of distal sodium reabsorption; following suspension, this saving increased still further, and there was a significant decrease in flow rate, filtrate and diuresis. Pretreatment with either drug restored the vasodilatatory and hydrosaluretic capacity of DA. Modalities whereby renal function is controlled in the presence of changes in body water and salt content. 1) During retention and during depletion in association with prazosin, anisosmotic transport of sodium is efficient in inverse proportion to the sodium load reaching the diluting segments. Prazosin depresses reabsorption efficiency in the presence of load values similar to those observed during simple depletion. 2) During retention, urinary sodium naturally depends on plasma osmolarity, whereas blood sodium appears to depend on urinary excretion of sodium. During depletion, renal excretion apparently depends on mean blood pressure. These extra-renal control mechanisms probably result in alteration of one or more of the components of the direct line running from the filtrate to the formation urine. 3) When DA is infused during water-salt retention, renal excretory function can be seen to depend on the glomerular filtrate through direct control of diuresis. During depletion in the early stage of DA infusion, on the other hand, the filtrate depends on excretory function through tubulo glomerular feedback control.", 
    "8": "beta-Adrenergic receptors from turkey erythrocyte membranes have been purified 1000-4000-fold using alprenolol-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Addition of deoxycholate solubilized egg phosphatidylcholine to the beta-adrenergic receptor, that is 5-10% pure and in 0.1% digitonin, followed by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration in buffers containing 30 mM MgCl2 results in 65-70% of the receptor being incorporated into phospholipid vesicles. The beta-adrenergic receptor as detected by photoaffinity labeling using [125I]azidobenzylpindolol in membranes and after alprenolol-Sepharose chromatography is a Mr = 40,000 peptide. Addition of deoxycholate extracts of human erythrocyte membranes, which contain the guanine nucleotide stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase (Ns) but not beta-adrenergic receptor, were used to reconstitute a guanine nucleotide-mediated change in agonist affinity for the receptor. These results demonstrate that the alprenolol-Sepharose affinity purified beta-adrenergic receptor is functional in both ligand binding and coupling to Ns. The procedure is rapid, efficient and should be generally applicable to beta-adrenergic receptor and Ns from several different membrane systems.", 
    "9": "Controversy continues to surround the value of drug treatment of hypertension in the elderly. Epidemiologic evidence implicates hypertension as a major risk factor in the precocious development of stroke and coronary heart disease in the elderly subject as clearly as it is implicated in the younger person. The hemodynamic and neuroendocrine profiles of the older patient with essential hypertension are similar to those of younger patients in the stable phase of the disease. However, the arterial ravages induced by many years of sustained hypertension render the circulation of the elderly subject more sensitive to pharmacologic intervention. The benefit-risk ratio of most antihypertensive drugs appears to be inversely related to age. Diuretics reduce the blood pressure at rest but have no influence on the increases in systolic pressure during normal activity; in addition, they carry potentially serious metabolic hazards in the elderly hypertensive patient. Centrally acting drugs likewise lower the blood pressure at rest without influencing the high systolic pressures induced by exercise. They also enhance the tendency to endogenous depression. Adrenergic-neurone blocking drugs and alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists are contraindicated because of the frequency of impaired cardiovascular reflexes in the elderly. The beta-blocking drugs can reduce the risk of coronary and cerebrovascular disease in the older patient with hypertension. They appear to be well tolerated, but because of their impaired metabolic handling in many elderly patients they should probably be used in smaller doses than those prescribed in younger patients. The influence of antihypertensive treatment on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the elderly hypertensive patient is not known.", 
    "10": "Beta blockade is the cornerstone of the therapy for ischemic heart disease and is increasingly used as first-line therapy for hypertension. Three chief properties that distinguish among different beta blockers are cardioselectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and pharmacokinetic differences. Cardioselectivity appears to confer some advantages, although there is a potential and serious danger in giving any beta blocker to patients with asthma, heart failure or active peripheral disease. The degree of ISA in different beta blockers may vary. This property may diminish the degree of cardiac depression caused by beta blockade, influencing the response to exercise, but on the other hand, it may make the beta blocker less beneficial in minimizing the effects of myocardial ischemia. Beta blockers also differ in duration of action, vasodilating capacity and effect on renal blood flow. Several mechanisms may be involved in the antihypertensive effects of beta antagonists. In elderly hypertensive patients, beta blockade should be given cautiously, especially if combined with a diuretic, and pharmacokinetic differences in this age group must be considered.", 
    "11": "The therapeutic importance of the ancillary pharmacologic property of partial agonist activity, or intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist is controversial. Its pharmacologic definition and accepted physiologic potential are now joined by convincing evidence that ISA may have important therapeutic implications. The ability to support basal cardiac functions while preventing the potential hazards of random sympathetic stimulation is an important attribute of this property, particularly in the damaged heart. The beneficial effects of ISA on peripheral blood flow, systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular afterload are established. Although all beta-blocking drugs are contraindicated in patients with asthma, ISA appears to be at least as important as cardioselectivity in offsetting some of the increase in airway resistance that results from beta blockade alone both at rest and during exertion. These pharmacodynamic consequences of ISA may explain the lesser reduction in exercise tolerance afforded by beta-blocking drugs with ISA than by those without. ISA may also enhance the primary oxygen-sparing effects of beta blockade in the ischemic myocardium by reducing coronary resistance, enhancing coronary blood flow, and reducing anaerobic metabolism. The adverse effects of beta-blocking drugs on blood lipids and carbohydrate metabolism also appear to be largely negated in drugs with ISA. The risks of rebound effects from abrupt withdrawal are significantly less in drugs with ISA than in those without.", 
    "12": "Beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the management of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Noncardioselective agents, cardioselective agents and beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) are equally effective, provided they are used in equipotent doses. Beta blockers can be used as first-line therapy in the management of hypertension and can be safely combined with diuretics, vasodilators, or both, for a better control of blood pressure. The exact mechanism by which beta blockers decrease blood pressure remains speculative, but they all reduce cardiac output during long-term therapy; drugs with ISA lower cardiac output and heart rate less than do drugs without ISA. Pharmacokinetic properties of beta blockers differ widely; drugs metabolized by the liver have shorter plasma half-lives than drugs primarily excreted by the kidneys. Although many of the side effects of various beta blockers are similar, differences in water and lipid solubility account for a higher incidence of central nervous system side effects with lipid-soluble drugs (such as propranolol and metoprolol) than with hydrophilic drugs (such as atenolol and timolol). The incidence of cold extremities has been reported to be less with drugs with ISA, and the incidence of bronchospasm less with cardioselective drugs. In the management of uncomplicated mild-to-moderate hypertension, all beta blockers are equally effective and produce less troublesome side effects than alternative antihypertensive agents. For effective therapy beta blockers can be used in 2 divided daily doses or even once daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "A multiprogrammable automatic antitachycardia pacemaker (Cybertach-60), connected to a tined \"J\" wire electrode, was positioned in the right atrial appendage in three patients with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Mechanisms of SVT included atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentry (two patients) and reciprocating tachycardia using an accessory pathway (one patient). Indications for implantation included frequent symptomatic episodes, multiple drug failures, and reproducible termination of the arrhythmia by the automatic pacemaker during electrophysiologic studies. Following discharge, multiple episodes of pacemaker malfunction were recorded. The three types of malfunction included: undersensing with induction of SVT by a single atrial premature depolarization, oversensing of extraneous electromechanical potentials triggering burst pacing which initiated SVT, and inappropriate burst pacing in response to sinus tachycardia with and without initiation of SVT. Treatment with a beta-blocking agent prevented pacemaker triggering by sinus tachycardia, and replacement of the electrode catheter resolved pacemaker triggering by electromechanical potentials. One patient required removal of the pacemaker because undersensing could not be corrected by repositioning the atrial electrode. This report illustrates three potential complications that may result with either normal or faulty sensing when employing automatic atrial antitachycardia pacemakers for control of SVT. It also stresses the importance of careful electrophysiologic evaluation before implantation and meticulous follow-up after implantation.", 
    "14": "In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation and diastolic filling have been reported. Therefore, we determined LV diastolic stiffness in nine patients with HCM before and 10 to 15 min after 0.15 mg/kg propranolol i.v. (group 1) and in six patients with HCM before and 10 to 15 min after 0.1 mg/kg verapamil i.v. (group 2). Simultaneous LV cineangiography and high-fidelity pressure measurements were performed in group 1 and simultaneous M-mode echocardiography and high-fidelity pressure measurements in group 2. Passive LV chamber stiffness was determined in group 1 from the diastolic pressure-volume data using an exponential three-parameter model: P = ae beta V + C, where P = pressure, alpha = intercept, beta = constant of chamber stiffness, V = volume and C = baseline pressure. Passive LV myocardial stiffness was estimated in group 2 from the diastolic stress-strain data using a viscoelastic model: sigma = alpha' (e beta' epsilon -1) + eta epsilon, where sigma = meridional wall stress, alpha = intercept, beta' = constant of myocardial stiffness, epsilon = midwall strain, eta = constant of myocardial viscosity and epsilon = strain rate. LV relaxation was assessed from the time constant of LV pressure decay (T) by plotting LV pressure versus negative dP/dt. LV diastolic filling was evaluated from peak and mean LV filling rate in group 1 and from peak and mean midwall lengthening rate in group 2. LV chamber and myocardial stiffness, respectively, remained unchanged before and after administration of propranolol (beta = 0.054 and 0.047) and verapamil (beta' = 14.8 and 12.6); however, the time constant of LV pressure decay T increased significantly in group 1 from 45 to 66 ms (P less than 0.05) and decreased significantly in group 2 from 53 to 43 ms (P less than 0.05). Parallel to the changes in LV isovolumic relaxation, mean LV diastolic filling rate decreased significantly in group 1 from 257 to 196 ml m-2 s-1 (P less than 0.025) and mean LV midwall lengthening rate increased significantly in group 2 from 2.37 to 4.31 cm/sec (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that LV diastolic stiffness remains unchanged in patients with HCM after propranolol and verapamil. LV relaxation and mean diastolic filling, however, are impaired in patients with HCM following propranolol but are improved after verapamil. Thus, the beneficial effect of verapamil on diastolic mechanics is related to improved relaxation and diastolic filling rather than to changes in LV diastolic stiffness.", 
    "15": "Potentially lethal arrhythmias (PLA) are common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and are implicated in sudden death. We have demonstrated that propranolol is effective in controlling symptoms, but have not previously evaluated its effect on PLA. Our protocol for long-term management has been applied to 50 patients followed for 2 to 14 years (mean 5.9 years). No patient was excluded because of disease severity or complications. The only reason for exclusion was non-compliance with the protocol. At entry, Holter monitoring revealed 16 PLA in 13 patients (sustained supraventricular tachycardia (SSVT) in two, sinus node dysfunction (SSS) in three, paired beats (PB) in five, and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in six). All patients were initially begun on propranolol, unless a different beta blocker was indicated. Dosage was adjusted to a standing heart rate of 60 beats/min unless adverse drug effects developed. Holter monitoring during follow-up identified 24 new PLA in 21 patients (SSVT = 1, SSS = 4, His-Purkinje disease = 3, VT = 10, and PB = 6). The total number of identified PLA is now 40 in 30 patients. Concurrent symptoms of syncope, presyncope and palpitations were of limited value in identifying PLA because of a lack of predictive accuracy (76%, 64% and 29%, respectively). Invasive electrophysiologic study or dosage adjustment proved that beta blockade was not responsible for the conduction system disorders observed in 10 patients requiring pacemaker insertion. beta-Blockade completely suppressed VT in two patients, PB in five, and SSVT in two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "Sixty-three patients operated upon for HOCM and 49 patients selected for non-surgical treatment have been followed-up for 15 years. Pre-operatively, surgical patients had a higher left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest and, on the average, more severe symptoms than non-surgical patients. Septal myectomy relieved the pressure gradient and symptoms more consistently than long-term treatment with beta-blockers or verapamil. Within an average observation time of 7 1/2 years, there was late deterioration or death in almost half of the non-surgical patients but in less than one-quarter in the operated patients. The 10 year mortality rate was 80% in the surgical series and 71% in the non-surgical series. In operated patients, pre-operative symptomatic status was significantly related to early and late mortality. In medically treated patients, mortality was unrelated to symptoms; however, it was significantly lower in patients receiving long term treatment with beta-blockers or verapamil. In conclusion, a high basal pressure gradient associated to limiting symptoms is a clear-cut indication for surgery. Other indications are more debatable. In medically treated patients, long-term administration of beta-blockers or verapamil is beneficial even without symptoms as it appears to improve prognosis.", 
    "17": "Based on bicycle ergometer tests in 50 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and 19 patients with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HNCM) if clinical (NYHA) class I to IV, the profile of several haemodynamic parameters (heart rate, stroke volume index, cardiac index, pulmonary artery pressure) during exercise was evaluated. The following pattern was found: (1) with increasing degree of clinical symptoms, the mean values of stroke volume decrease and the mean values of pulmonary artery pressure increase; (2) stroke volume does not show the normal increase during exercise in a considerable number of patients (48% of HOCM, 26% of HNCM patients); (3) failing increase in stroke volume is in part compensated by increase in heart rate; (4) pathological increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure correlates with severity of clinical symptoms, but even a considerable number of clinically asymptomatic patients exhibit extremely pathological pressure increase; (5) there is no fundamental difference of the behaviour of the measured haemodynamic parameters between HOCM and HNCM; (6) there is marked overlapping of exercise-induced haemodynamic changes between patients of different NYHA classes of clinical impairment. Therefore, measurements of exercise haemodynamics are necessary to define clearly the degree of functional impairment in the individual patient. Based on identically performed exercise tests in 53 patients with HOCM, the clinical and haemodynamic effects of medical therapy with propranolol (n = 12) or verapamil (n = 25) and of surgical treatment (n = 21) were compared. Maximal exercise capacity was on an average not changed after propranolol but increased after verapamil and, most significantly, after surgery. This could be attributed to corresponding haemodynamic changes, especially concerning cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressure. As a whole, verapamil was clinically and haemodynamically superior to propranolol, but not as effective as surgical treatment.", 
    "18": "Chronic therapy with propranolol has been shown to reduce the incidence of sudden death in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, the long-term effect of beta blockade on exercise capacity has not been studied adequately. Therefore, 32 patients with HCM (21 men), mean age of 47 years (range = 14 to 80 years), were evaluated for dyspnea and chest pain and underwent stress testing (ST) prior to therapy. At entry, ST was contraindicated in four patients, because of heart failure (three patients) and sustained supraventricular tachycardia (one patient). The remaining patients completed 4.9 +/- 3.2 min (mean +/- S.D.) of the Bruce protocol with a functional aerobic capacity (FAC) of 51 +/- 28%. All were placed on propranolol, unless a beta blocker with other characteristics was indicated. Dosage was adjusted to achieve a standing heart rate of 60 beats/min unless adverse effects occurred. At last follow-up, 25 patients were receiving 501 +/- 147 mg propranolol/day while the remainder received nadolol or metoprolol. On the most recent ST, patients exercised 6.6 +/- 3.1 min (38% increase), while mean FAC increased by 24% (both P less than 0.05). The FAC improved by more than 15% in 21, by less than 15% in five, was unchanged in five and was worse in only one, a noncompliant patient. The 21 patients with an FAC increment much greater than 15% exercised longer at entry than the remaining 11 (6.6 +/- 3.3 vs 3.9 +/- 2.8 minutes, P less than 0.05). The mean peak ST blood pressure-heart rate product of the group decreased from 26 550 to 17 898 (P less than 0.05), while the symptom scores of dyspnea and chest pain declined from 2.2 +/- 0.8 to 0.8 +/- 0.7 and from 1.4 +/- 1.0 to 0.3 +/- 0.8, respectively (both P less than 0.001). We conclude that beta blockade produces sustained improvement in exercise capacity. Improvement was greatest in those with the least initial impairment, and appears to be related to a reduction in blood pressure-heart rate product.", 
    "19": "In a total of 339 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (typical HOCM, n = 224; atypical HOCM, n = 30; HNCM, n = 80) the clinical course, the Sokolow-Lyon index in the ECG and the prognosis as demonstrated by cumulative survival rates were analysed to get more differentiated information for the characterization of these myocardial disorders. No change in the type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was found, indicating different clinical entities. No increase of the Sokolow-Lyon index was observed during follow-up. Only a small proportion of patients seemed to benefit from treatment with propranolol. Surgical treatment appears to be the therapy of choice, at least in the advanced stage of the disease refractory to medical treatment. In addition, strong evidence was obtained that surgical treatment improved the prognosis in patients with typical HOCM.", 
    "20": "Post-trial injections of norepinephrine (NE) or cycloheximide (CHX) into the amygdala produces a long-term retention deficity (amnesia) for a 1-trial footshock experience in rats. concomitant post-trial injections of the adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, prevents NE-, but not CHX-induced amnesia. These results indicate separate mechanisms of action for amnesia produced by intracranial CHX and NE injections.", 
    "21": "The effects of intravenous injections of lorazepam, scopolamine and propranolol upon hippocampal potentiation produced by commissural stimulation have been investigated in rats anaesthetized with urethane. Administration of 250 micrograms/kg or 500 micrograms/kg lorazepam significantly delayed the onset of secondary potentiation (frequency potentiation) of the population spikes recorded in subfields CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus. Scopolamine also delayed the onset of frequency potentiation in CA1, but only at high dose (10 mg/kg). No other measured parameters of frequency potentiation, paired-pulse potentiation or post-tetanic potentiation were affected by any of the drugs. Lorazepam (greater than or equal to 250 micrograms/kg) and propranolol (3 mg/kg) reduced the severity of hippocampal after-discharge. Rhythmic entrainment of after-discharges was occasionally observed. The results are discussed in relation to the possible link between hippocampal potentiation and memory processes.", 
    "22": "The effect of regular physical training on skeletal muscle lipoprotein lipase activity (LPLA) was investigated in 16 healthy men of normal body weight. They trained on cycle ergometers for 8 weeks. During the training period half the group were given the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propanolol (160 mg/day) and the other half placebo tablets. Muscle tissue samples were taken before the training period and 4 days after the last training session and drug intake to ensure that there were no acute effects of either training or drug treatment. The maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2max, 1/min) increased by 8% with training. LPLA increased by 47% and 31% in the placebo and beta-blockade group, respectively. Capillary density increased by 19% and 17%. The statistical analysis revealed a significant effect of training but not of beta-blockade on these changes. The present longitudinal training study in healthy men confirms the results of cross-sectional studies showing higher muscle LPLA in well-trained than in sedentary men.", 
    "23": "The effects of intracoronary nifedipine on myocardial performance were studied in the absence and presence of beta-blockade with propranolol (0.5 mg X kg-1 i.v. bolus + infusion). In anaesthetized pigs nifedipine (0.025, 0.05 and 0.5 microgram X kg-1 X min-1) produced dose-dependent increases in coronary flow (up to 65% from base line, 39 +/- 4 ml X min-1) and decreases in myocardial O2-consumption (MO2-cons, up to 50%, base line 3.10 +/- 0.34 ml X min-1). The two lower doses caused a negligible depression of systemic haemodynamics (cardiac output, CO smaller than 8%, base line 2.70 +/- 0.14 l X min-1; mean arterial pressure, MAP smaller than 10%, base line 10.9 +/- 0.4 kPa), but after the highest dose MAP and CO decreased by 20%. Following pretreatment with propranolol, the effects of nifedipine on cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were additive for the two lower doses, but with 0.5 microgram X kg-1 X min-1 the superimposed effects were less pronounced. Nifedipine alone was able to increase cardiac efficiency, defined as (MAP X CO)/MO2-cons, by 10-20%, but failed to improve cardiac efficiency when this was previously reduced by administration of propranolol. Our data indicate that intracoronary infusion of nifedipine can be performed safely when beta-blockade is already instituted, but that nifedipine alone decreases MO2-consumption to the same level as the combination, with less depression of global myocardial function.", 
    "24": "A single drop, double-masked study was performed using 1% betaxolol ophthalmic solution in 24 normal subjects. Subjects received one drop of this new drug to one eye and a placebo drop to the fellow eye. Aqueous humor flow was measured using the technique of fluorophotometry, and outflow resistance was measured using tonography. Betaxolol suppressed aqueous humor flow in all individuals. The range of suppression was from 7 to 51%, with a mean suppression of 32 +/- 13%. The drug had no consistent effect on outflow resistance, and no pupillary changes were seen.", 
    "25": "Electrical stimulation of prefrontal cortex in anesthetized rabbits evoked small (less than 10%) changes in heart rate. In contrast, stimulation of the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus (MD) elicited decreases in heart rate proportional to the stimulating current. The maximal peak reductions in heart rate evoked by higher current intensities were 85% from prestimulus levels. The bradycardiac response had a short latency after stimulus onset (less than 1 s, peak within 5 s), and the heart rate usually returned to baseline within 30 s after stimulation. Vagal cholinergic innervation of the heart was suggested as the final effector pathway since bilateral vagotomy or administration of atropine (sulfate or methyl nitrate, 0.15-0.4 mg/kg, i.v.) virtually abolished the rapid bradycardiac responses. Administration of a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol, 3 mg/kg, i.v.) was without effect on the heart rate response. The effective medial thalamic area for evoking a response was localized to MD, the thalamic midline nuclei between both MDs and a region continuous with, but posterior to MD (e.g. parafascicular nucleus). A descending effector pathway from the thalamus was implicated since complete bilateral ablation of prefrontal cortex did not reduce the stimulus-produced bradycardia evoked from MD. Similar large bradycardiac responses were obtained in an unanesthetized preparation to both MD stimulation and to sensory stimuli, suggesting a possible physiological correlate for these intracranially-evoked heart rate changes.", 
    "26": "There is a major controversy over the relative value of anti-hypertensive drugs in hypertension in pregnancy. Our purpose was to study two different beta-adrenolytic drugs, atenolol, a cardioselective beta blocker, and labetalol, an alpha-beta blocker. Fifty-six hypertensive (BP greater than 140/90 mmHg) pregnant women were treated either with atenolol or labetalol. The patients were divided into two subgroups for which there were no statistical differences with regard to age, number of previous pregnancies, initial level of blood pressure and uricemia, proteinuric pre-eclampsia, beginning of therapeutic trial and delivery. The average daily dosage was 144.6 +/- 47.8 mg day-1 with atenolol and 614 +/- 47.8 mg day-1 with labetalol. This study shows: the same anti-hypertensive effect of the two drugs with control of blood pressure in 82% of the cases; a birth-weight significantly higher with labetalol (3280 +/- 555 g) than with atenolol (2750 +/- 630 g) (P less than 0.001); two still-births with atenolol; no adverse effects of the drugs during pregnancy and the neo-natal period; the trans-placental passage of atenolol and labetalol as shown by plasma dosages in the mothers and the new-born. It is concluded that atenolol and labetalol are safe and they are usually effective in the control of the hypertension complicating pregnancy. But labetalol appears to be better able to prevent the appearance of fetal growth retardation.", 
    "27": "The echocardiographically visualized mitral valve motion pattern has been shown to be related to left ventricular diastolic parameters and systolic performance. In order to analyze the influence of a negative inotropic agent (penbutolol, Betapressin) and a positive inotropic drug (AR-L 115 BS, Vardax) on the movement of the anterior mitral valve leaflet (aMV), the following motion phases of the aMV were determined in 23 patients following completion of diagnostic cardiac catheterization: DE slope, EF slope, the final closing velocity of the aMV (AC/BC slope), CE amplitude, AC interval, and PQ-AC interval. These values were compared to several hemodynamic parameters. In 13 patients (group I) control values were obtained under physiological conditions as well as during right atrial pacing at constant pacing rate in order to exclude changes in heart rate. Measurements were repeated under spontaneous heart rate and during atrial pacing following the application of penbutolol. In the other 10 patients (group II) the echocardiographic and hemodynamic data were obtained before and after the intravenous application of AR-L 115 BS. In addition, left ventriculography was repeated in 8 patients after the pharmacologic intervention. The investigations revealed changes in the mitral valve motion pattern following negative and positive inotropic interventions. The most marked changes occurred in the AC/BC slope, which declined significantly after beta blockade with penbutolol (means 300.1 mm/s vs. means 208.4 mm/s; p less than 0.01). This effect proved to be unaffected by heart rate: there was also a reduction of the closure slope after application of penbutolol during atrial pacing (means 343.1 mm/s vs. means 268.6 mm/s; p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "The effects of propranolol on the metabolism (cell growth, cell differentiation and cell respiration) as well as on membrane-associated polysaccharide components of Herpetomonas muscarum muscarum were investigated. At the dose of 10(-2) and 10(-3) mM the drug increased significantly the number of the more differentiated opisthomastigote form of the protozoan, whereas at higher concentrations (10(-1) mM) total inhibition of growth occurred with gross cell lysis. Propranolol (10(-3) mM) enhanced the oxidation of glycerol and more markedly that of glucose, glutamic acid and proline. The pattern of the composition of membrane-associated polysaccharides was also substantially changed: the drug (10(-3) mM) induced a preferential synthesis of galactose and a marked decrease of xylose and mannose, whereas glucose content remained practically unchanged.", 
    "29": "4-Hydroxypropranolol glycol (2), a suspected metabolite of propranolol was synthesized from 4-allyloxy-1-naphthaldehyde (4). Osmium tetroxide oxidation of 4 afforded a glycol (5) and subsequent Baeyer-Villiger rearrangement afforded 2. Its presence as a biliary metabolite in a dog maintained on a constant infusion of pseudoracemic propranolol (made up of equal molar 2S-propranolol-3',3'-d2 and 2R-propranolol-d0) into the portal vein was confirmed based on GC-MS data of the TFA and TMS derivatives of the standard and biliary metabolites. Greater amounts of 2 arose from 2R-propranolol than from 2S-propranolol (1.5:1). Similarly, 2 was formed as a urinary metabolite in one subject maintained on oral propranolol, 80 mg every 6 hours. Compound 2 was also formed when propranolol and propranolol glycol were incubated in the presence of the rat liver 9000g supernatant fraction. In addition to 2, an isomeric ring-hydroxylated propranolol glycol, perhaps 7-hydroxypropranolol glycol, was formed when propranolol glycol was the substrate.", 
    "30": "We have assessed resting myocardial contractility and its baroreflex control in normotensive and hypertensive conscious rabbits. Hypertension was induced by bilateral cellophane wrapping of the kidneys with experiments performed 6 weeks later during the established phase of hypertension. The peak rate of change of left ventricular pressure (peak LV dP/dt) was used as the index of myocardial contractility. Baroreflex control of contractility and heart period (HP) was assessed by constructing stimulus response curves relating change in mean arterial pressure (MAP), induced by balloon occluders around the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, to change in peak LV dP/dt and HP. These stimulus response curves were obtained in normotensive rabbits with and without cardiac pacing, and in both normotensive and hypertensive animals after cardiac beta sympathetic blockade with propranolol, vagal blockade with methylscopolamine, and combined cardiac autonomic blockade with propranolol and scopolamine, as well as in rabbits with intact autonomic effectors. Resting MAP was significantly higher in the hypertensive rabbits (119 +/- 2 mm Hg) compared to normotensive controls (76 +/- 1 mm Hg). Resting peak LV dP/dt was also greater by 51% in the hypertensive animals (7054 +/- 287 mm Hg sec-1) compared to controls (4690 +/- 223 mm Hg sec-1). There was no significant difference in the resting heart period or resting left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Transient changes in MAP induced by occlusion of the aortic or venous balloons produced significant alterations in peak LV dP/dt in normotensive animals with and without pacing and in hypertensive control animals. In animals with cardiac sympathetic block, the range and slope or sensitivity of the stimulus response curves were not significantly changed but in animals with vagal blockade the sensitivity was reduced by 90% and the range at 30 mm Hg by 88%. After propranolol and methylscopolamine were administered together, the stimulus no longer evoked a response. These experiments demonstrate that myocardial contractility is under baroreflex control and suggest that this is mediated principally via parasympathetic nerves to the heart. There was no significant difference between the sensitivity of baroreflex control of myocardial contractility in the normotensive (-84 +/- 14 mm Hg sec-1 per mm Hg) and the hypertensive (-110 +/- 14 mm Hg sec-1 per mm Hg) rabbits, unlike the baroreflex control of heart period where sensitivity was markedly impaired in the hypertensive (sensitivity 3.8 +/- 0.8 msec/mm Hg) compared to the normotensive (6.9 +/- 1.0 msec/mm Hg) animals.", 
    "31": "Electrolytic lesions were placed along the anteroventral wall of the third cerebral ventricle (AV3V region) in 10 albino rabbits (AV3V-X), and sham lesions were produced in 10 additional rabbits (SHAM). Two to 3 weeks later, all rabbits underwent unilateral nephrectomy and renal artery stenosis (clip I.D. = 0.508 mm). During a 1-week control period, and for 4 weeks after renal artery stenosis, measurements were made of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, body fluid compartment volumes, plasma electrolytes, and daily sodium, potassium, and water balances. Four weeks after renal artery stenosis (RAS), cardiovascular responses to norepinephrine (NE), angiotensin II (AII), saralasin, and autonomic blockade were obtained in the conscious animals. In SHAM rabbits, MAP rose from 77 to 117 mm Hg 4 weeks after RAS. In AV3V-X rabbits, MAP rose from 77 to only 92 mm Hg 4 weeks after RAS. Body fluid compartment volumes, plasma electrolytes, and fluid, sodium, and potassium balances showed similar modest changes in both groups of rabbits. Neither saralasin infusion nor autonomic blockade caused significantly different changes in MAP between SHAM and AV3V-X rabbits 4 weeks after RAS. However, pressor responses to both NE and AII were significantly less in AV3V-X rabbits at this time. It is concluded that one-kidney, one clip renal hypertension involves activation of neurohormonal pressor mechanisms originating in the forebrain, and that the expression of these pressor mechanisms in part includes an increase in cardiovascular reactivity.", 
    "32": "Fingertip blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography before and during a stressful mental task consisting of rapid serial arithmetic calculations in a 25 degrees C room. Significant rises in heart rate and blood pressure indicated that stress was actually induced in all individuals. During mental stress in normal subjects, blood flow decreased (46.4 +/- 6.2 to 22.4 +/- 4.9 ml X min-1 per 100 ml tissue; P less than 0.01) and vascular resistance increased (2.1 +/- 0.4 to 7.6 +/- 2.2 units; P less than 0.01). Patients with Raynaud's disease unexpectedly increased blood flow (15.4 +/- 4.2 to 21.6 +/- 5.7; P = 0.05) and decreased vascular resistance (9.7 +/- 2.3 to 7.1 +/- 1.4; P = 0.05). Ten additional normal subjects were studied in a cool room (20 degrees C). Their digits remained vasoconstricted during stress, as blood flow (7.4 +/- 2.9 to 5.1 +/- 1.3) and vascular resistance (31.5 +/- 11.1 to 34.4 +/- 8.2) varied insignificantly (P greater than 0.10). The digital vasodilatation which occurs during mental stress in patients with Raynaud's disease was not altered by pretreatment with oral indomethacin, with intra-arterial propranolol or atropine, or by digital nerve block. These findings suggest the existence of an active digital vasodilatory mechanism in patients with Raynaud's disease.", 
    "33": "Subjects in whom it was found that after a month's treatment with beta-blockers there was a fall of not less than 10 mmHg in systolic blood pressure persisting 54 h after cessation of treatment were considered to have \"adapted\". Significant falls of blood pressure and heart rate were observed, and were still present after two further weeks of treatment with placebo, but these adaptations were not correlated with each other. Fourteen hypertensive patients and five normotensive subjects received oral propranolol 80 mg, or metoprolol 100 mg, twice daily for 5 days. They were studied before treatment, and 54 h after the last dose. Drug administration was continued for a further 26 days, and the subjects were again examined 54 h after cessation of treatment. Blood was withdrawn at the times of study and contained negligible amounts of drug in the plasma. Records were made of blood pressure and ECG at rest and after exercise, the post-exercise QT being measured at a heart rate of exactly 100 beats per minute, obviating the need for any correction of QT. QT intervals were significantly prolonged, both at rest and on exercise. Responses to intravenous propranolol 10 mg or metoprolol 20 mg were also measured during the study periods, and no hypersensitivity to the drugs was found at rest or after exercise.", 
    "34": "In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the oral administration of one single dose of metoprolol as well as of propranolol causes a significant increase in the venous platelet concentration. In the present study, we investigated the effect of metoprolol, administered twice daily over a period of 1 week, on the venous platelet count in a group of healthy volunteers. The results showed that the drug significantly raised the venous platelet concentration over the whole study period. Further, the effect of 1 week's metoprolol and propranolol medication on ADP-induced platelet aggregation was investigated in another group of healthy subjects; the results were compared to those obtained during 1 week of placebo medication. It was demonstrated that neither of the two beta-blocking drugs affected ADP-induced platelet aggregability; this was true on the first as well as on the last day of study.", 
    "35": "In order to investigate the involvement of catecholamines (CAs) in acute stomach ulceration induced by hypothalamic lesions, rats were given bilateral electrolytic anodal lesions in the medial hypothalamus followed by a single subcutaneous injection of CA agonist or antagonist drugs. As in previous studies, lesioned rats that received no post operative drug treatment showed extensive gastric damage when examined 24 hr after the brain lesion. Chlorpromazine, amphetamine, desipramine and isoproterenol caused significant reductions in the extent (total length) and/or number of erosions induced by the brain lesion. Haloperidol and propranolol did not seem to affect ulcer formation. Clozapine increased the number but not the total length of ulcers. Phentolamine, alone or in combination with propranolol, significantly increased both the number and total length of lesion-induced ulcers. Similarities between these results and those reported for most of these drugs in the context of ulcers induced by various experimental stress procedures suggest a degree of commonality between acute stress ulcers and ulcers induced by hypothalamic lesions. The overall pattern of results obtained is also consistent with evidence indicating a protective role for catecholamines in acute ulcer formation.", 
    "36": "In two patients with orthostatic hypotension, due to autonomic dysfunction, hemodynamic changes induced by the assumption of erect position have been evaluated before and during chronic propranolol treatment. Under control conditions, the change in posture induced in Patient 1 a fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 51.4 and 30.7%, respectively. Cardiac output was reduced by 26.8% and systemic vascular resistance by 23.3%. During propranolol treatment, systolic pressure decreased only by 28% and diastolic pressure by 7.7%. The decline in systemic vascular resistance on standing was abolished, while the reduction in cardiac output remained unmodified. In Patient 2, symptoms of orthostatic hypotension were related to marked decrease in systolic blood pressure, the diastolic pressure remaining unchanged. Moreover, systemic vascular resistance increased and, thus, orthostatic hypotension was exclusively dependent upon the severe fall in cardiac output on standing. As a consequence, propranolol failed to control orthostatic hypotension in this patient. These data suggest that when orthostatic hypotension is secondary to failure in peripheral vasoconstriction, propranolol may act beneficially. When it is secondary to a fall in cardiac output, beta-blockade is ineffective.", 
    "37": "We investigated the reproducibility of sinus node cycle length (SCL), corrected sinus node recovery time (CSRT) and sino-atrial conduction time (SACT) during the control state and following autonomic blockade in 25 patients (mean age: 56.9 +/- 13.8 years). Autonomic blockade was induced by i.v. administration of propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) and atropine (0.04 mg/kg). The electrophysiological study was repeated after 24 hr and the results were compared. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (15) with normal and Group 2 (10) with abnormal intrinsic sinus node function. Following autonomic blockade in Group 1 the daily variations in SCL, CSRT and SACT were very slight whereas in Group 2 there was far greater variability in these parameters. However, in the latter group there were no patients who changed their status from prolonged to normal intrinsic CSRT on the second study, whereas SACT changed its status in 2 patients. In Group 1 the daily variations in sinus node parameters were much slighter following autonomic blockade than during the control state. In Group 2 the variations were very similar during control and following autonomic blockade. These data suggest that: (1) following autonomic blockade the reproducibility of sinus node parameters is very good in Group 1, whereas in Group 2 several patients show marked daily variations in sinus node parameters; (2) following autonomic blockade the sinus node electrophysiological parameters are meaningful in diagnosing an involvement of intrinsic sinus node function; and (3) in patients with abnormal sinus node parameters during control state, but with normal intrinsic sinus node function, the daily variations are mainly due to change in autonomic tone, whereas when the intrinsic sinus node function is abnormal, the day to day variations during control state appear due predominantly to intrinsic sinus node abnormalities.", 
    "38": "Effects of amrinone on the membrane action potential and spontaneous activity were investigated in sinus node pacemaker cells of rabbit heart by use of microelectrode techniques. Amrinone (1 X 10(-4) M to 6 X 10(-6) M) caused a shortening of cycle length of spontaneous firing (SPCL) accompanied by an increase in the maximum upstroke velocity at phase O (Vmax) and amplitude of action potential (AAP), while it did not affect the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). All the effects of amrinone on sinus node pacemaker cells were markedly attenuated or abolished in a low calcium medium (Ca+ 0.1 mM or 0.3 mM) or in the presence of the slow channel blocking agent, verapamil (5 X 10(-7) M, 2 X 10(-6) M). The effects of amrinone were not antagonized by the beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, pindolol (2 X 10(-7) M). These results indicate that amrinone has an intrinsic effect on sinus node pacemaker cells, increasing their spontaneous firing activity. It is also assumed that the effects of amrinone on sinus node cells are probably mediated by an augmentation of the slow calcium and/or sodium inward current through the cell membrane.", 
    "39": "The effect of rifampicin on the blood concentration-time curve of propranolol at steady-state following oral administration of 120 mg every 8 h was investigated in six normal, young, male subjects. After an initial 2 week dosing period, all individuals additionally received 600 mg rifampicin daily for 3 weeks followed by a 4 week period during which again only the propranolol was given. In four of the subjects the effects of 900 and 1200 mg rifampicin daily was also studied. Changes in disposition were assessed by estimation of propranolol's oral clearance and elimination half-life during the dosage interval. Rifampicin (600 mg/day) caused a large increase in propranolol's oral clearance (35.7 +/- 16.3 vs 96.1 +/- 26.9 ml min-1 kg-1, mean +/- s.d.), but neither the elimination half-life nor extent of plasma binding were affected. Increasing the daily dosage to 900 and 1200 mg did not cause any additional changes in oral clearance. Four weeks after discontinuing rifampicin, propranolol's oral clearance had essentially returned to its pre-induction level. The oral clearance of propranolol was significantly smaller (89.5 +/- 14.4%) during the dosage interval immediately after administration of the last rifampicin dose than the value measured 24 h later. The findings are consistent with rifampicin causing induction of the drug metabolizing enzymes responsible for propranolol's biotransformation. The marked reduction in the steady-state propranolol blood concentration that results from chronic rifampicin administration would be expected to result in a significant change in clinical effectiveness of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker when the two drugs are used concurrently.", 
    "40": "A patient on a regimen of 400 mg/day of propranolol hydrochloride was observed to have elevated thyroxine (T4) and free T4 levels with a normal thyrotropin response to protirelin. This led us to study the prevalence of hyperthyroxinemia in 14 consecutively treated patients with hypertension on daily doses of propranolol of 320 mg or more. Four of 14 patients had elevated serum T4 levels. As a group, the patients on propranolol therapy had higher serum T4 levels, free T4 indices, and triiodothyronine levels than did healthy controls. The use of high-dosage propranolol may be associated with euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and be a source of diagnostic confusion. All patients receiving therapy with high-dosage propranolol should undergo protirelin testing before one can conclude that their elevated thyroid hormone levels are due to hyperthyroidism.", 
    "41": "To determine the effect of topical timolol on corneal endothelial cell morphology in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of 40 healthy human eyes, we photographed the central corneal endothelium with a contact specular microscope before and after two weeks of treatment with placebo (20 eyes), with 0.5% timolol with 0.01% benzalkonium chloride (ten eyes), or with 0.5% timolol without benzalkonium chloride (ten eyes). From the specular photomicrographs, we analyzed five morphologic cell characteristics by means of electronic digitizer and microcomputer--cell density, mean cell area, the coefficient of variation for cell area, mean cell perimeter and a new feature quantifying cell shape. Statistical analysis of the data showed that two weeks of exposure to topical timolol or its preservative had no significant effect on corneal endothelial cell morphology in young, healthy eyes in vivo.", 
    "42": "Sixteen patients with uncomplicated systemic hypertension were treated with placebo, diltiazem (180 mg/day) and propranolol (60 mg/day) for 1 month each. Each patient performed multistage symptom-limited treadmill exercise tests during each period of administration. There was no significant difference in maximal exercise duration between placebo, diltiazem and propranolol. Diltiazem significantly decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and heart rate at rest, during submaximal exercise at the same work load and maximal exercise. Propranolol produced similar changes in systemic BP and heart rate at rest and during exercise. However, the reductions in systolic BP, heart rate and pressure-rate product with diltiazem during exercise were smaller than those with propranolol at small doses, suggesting that diltiazem in its usual therapeutic dose was almost devoid of beta-blocking activity. Thus, diltiazem may be of benefit to hypertensive patients because it reduces systemic BP even during exercise. It is particularly useful when systemic hypertension occurs in association with coronary artery disease because of its effects of coronary artery dilatation and heart rate reduction.", 
    "43": "Preliminary investigations in the rat revealed some unexpected alterations in the pharmacokinetics of l-propranolol when single dose studies were performed on two separate occasions 7 days apart. The apparent volume of distribution of l-propranolol was found to be consistently lower on the second study day. Also, the systemic availability of orally administered propranolol (6 mg/kg) increased from 4.1 to 7.8% from the 1st to the 2nd study day, indicating a decrease in the presystemic clearance of the drug. These changes were associated with a 50 to 60% decrease in the serum unbound fraction of l-propranolol between the 2 study days. Further investigations revealed that the time-dependent increase in the serum protein binding of l-propranolol was elicited by the presence of an indwelling venous catheter which was surgically implanted for the purpose of blood sampling. In contrast, a slight decrease in the serum protein binding of an acidic drug, phenytoin, was observed after catheter implantation. These changes in serum drug protein binding were readily reversed when the indwelling catheter was removed. The total serum protein concentration was not affected by catheter implantation. Fractionation of serum proteins by electrophoresis revealed an increase in alpha 1- and gamma-globulin fractions, a slight decrease in serum albumin and no change in beta- and alpha 2-globulin fractions. Competitive protein binding studies with tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate, a specific ligand to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), indicate that the increase in serum l-propranolol binding was largely due to an elevation in serum AAG. These observations also explain the opposite effect of catheterization on the serum protein binding of phenytoin, which is bound largely to serum albumin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The disposition of (+)- and (-)-propranolol was determined after chronic as compared to single oral doses of racemic drug. Single oral doses (80 mg) of a stable isotope-labeled pseudoracemate were given to six dogs before and after chronic pretreatment with unlabeled propranolol. The bioavailability of (-)-propranolol (5.7 +/- 1.6%; mean +/- S.E.) was considerably lower (P less than .01) than that of (+)-propranolol (16.1 +/- 5.9%) after single doses. Chronic pretreatment led to a 167% increase in the bioavailability of (-)-propranolol to 15.2 +/- 3.7% (P less than .01), with only a 47% increase in (+)-propranolol to 23.7 +/- 4.5% (N.S.). Chronic pretreatment had no effect on the kinetics of i.v. doses of tritium-labeled racemic drug administered simultaneously or on blood binding. This stereoselective increase in the bioavailability of (-)-propranolol was associated with an unexpected 62% increase in the glucuronidation of this enantiomer (P less than .01) with no effect on the glucuronidation of (+)-propranolol. There was, however, a change in the stereochemical composition of 4'-hydroxypropranolol from single doses, (-)/(+)-enantiomer ratio 1.37 +/- 0.14, to chronic doses, 1.23 +/- 0.13 (P less than 0.05), suggesting stereoselective inhibition of ring-oxidation of (-)-propranolol. This study demonstrates preferential presystemic hepatic removal of (-)-propranolol in the dog by a process, probably ring-oxidation, that becomes partially inhibited after chronic doses, leading to a stereoselective increase in the bioavailability of this enantiomer.", 
    "45": "The effect of uranyl nitrate-induced renal failure on the pharmacokinetics of the levo-isomer of propranolol in rats was investigated. The serum clearance of an i.v. dose of propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) in normal animals approached hepatic blood flow, suggesting that the systemic clearance of the drug is rate-limited by blood flow to the liver. Extensive first-pass metabolism was observed after oral administration of l-propranolol was only 7%. Renal failure had no apparent effect on the distribution and elimination of i.v. administered l-propranolol. In contrast, the area under the serum drug concentration time curve after oral administration was increased from 6.95 to 19.3 micrograms X min/ml, which corresponded to a 2.5-fold increase in the systemic availability of l-propranolol (from 7 to 18%). The gastrointestinal absorption of l-propranolol, as assessed by comparing the urinary recovery of radioactivity after i.v. and oral administration of l-[3H]propranolol, was complete in normal animals. Hence, an increase in the extent of absorption of l-propranolol in renal failure cannot be offered as a cause of increased systemic availability. Neither the in vitro nor the in vivo serum protein binding of l-propranolol differed between renal failure and control animals. The intrinsic metabolic clearance of unbound l-propranolol in renal failure rats is estimated to be about 60% lower than that in control rats. These results suggest that the previously reported increase in propranolol serum concentration after oral administration of the drug to uremic patients is due to decreased presystemic biotransformation of the drug.", 
    "46": "Within 30 minutes of the administration of his first dose of timolol ophthalmic solution, a 67-year-old man with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experienced severe dyspnea leading to respiratory arrest. He recovered after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with bronchospastic pulmonary disease who are candidates for therapy with timolol ophthalmic solution should receive their first dose under medical supervision and should have continued close medical follow-up for as long as they receive timolol.", 
    "47": "A randomized double-blind crossover trial was conducted in 20 patients with moderate to severe hypertension to compare the efficacy of labetalol, which combines alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties, with that of metoprolol alone or in combination with prazosin. After placebo for 1 wk, active medication was given in two 6-wk phases. During one phase, metoprolol (100 to 400 mg/day) was given with prazosin (2 to 4 mg/day) as an option in the last 3 wk, whereas during the other phase, labetalol (200 to 1000 mg/day) was given alone. Satisfactory control of supine blood pressure was obtained in 10 patients with metoprolol and in another four patients after the addition of prazosin. During the labetalol phase, blood pressure control was achieved in 11 of 19 patients tested. Gastrointestinal disturbances, nasal congestion, impotence, failure to ejaculate, scalp tingling, and headache were more prevalent in the labetalol phase than in the other. In four cases these occurred in patients who did not require prazosin. Supine, erect, and exercise pulse rates were reduced by both metoprolol with or without prazosin and by labetalol; the effects were less in the labetalol phase. These differences could arise from an action of labetalol on cardiac presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors. Adjunctive use of prazosin in nonresponders to metoprolol increases the response rate and avoids unnecessary deployment of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade in patients whose blood pressure can be controlled by beta-blockade alone.", 
    "48": "We examined in vitro effects of propranolol and its major metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol, on human platelets. Both propranolol and its 4-hydroxy metabolite had no significant direct effect on either platelet aggregation or TXA2 generation in therapeutic concentrations. Higher concentrations (greater than or equal to 10 micrograms/ml), however, reduced both parameters of platelet function. When propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol were incubated in combination with platelets in equal concentrations, there were synergistic effects on platelet aggregation and TXA2 generation. Neither propranolol nor 4-hydroxypropranolol inhibited platelet aggregation or TXA2 synthesis in sonicated platelets at any concentration, indicating that intact platelet membrane is necessary for their action.", 
    "49": "The forearm blood flow responses to hypoxia obtained from ten subjects (ages 26-37 years) before and after propranolol showed no relation with either plasma osmolality or plasma concentrations of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Pi and Cl-. The average oral dose of 3.3 mg of propranolol/kg body weight decreased the overall mean flow response to hypoxia by 42.2% (P less than 0.025). This reflects some beta-adrenoceptor involvement. The residual vasodilatation observed after beta-blockade by propranolol could be attributed to activation of cholinergic vasodilator fibres by hypoxic stress. The mean heart rate during acute hypoxia before and after propranolol administration was 95 and 89 beats/min respectively. The residual tachycardia could be due to reduction of vagal tone during the hypoxic stress. The response of arterial blood pressure to the hypoxic stress before and after propranolol administration, on the other hand, was found to be negligible in most subjects. This lack of response during emotional stress is in agreement with previous findings. In the present circumstances the possible increase in baroreceptor activity is probably masked by the general peripheral vasodilatation.", 
    "50": "The effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the efficacy of exercise training in patients with coronary artery disease were assessed in a community-based cardiac rehabilitation program. Twenty-five patients took no beta-adrenergic-blocking agent and 17 patients took a constant dose of propranolol during the 3 month study period. Individual exercise prescriptions consisted of an intensity of 70% of maximal workload monitored by heart rate, performed 20 min each session, three sessions per week. Both groups improved in maximal exercise capacity: from 8.7 +/- 1.9 (mean +/- SD) to 9.7 +/- 2.1 mets (p less than .01) in those not taking propranolol and from 6.6 +/- 1.5 to 7.7 +/- 1.8 mets (p less than .01) in those taking the drug. At a workload of 70% of maximal achieved at pretraining testing, heart rate decreased with training from 123 +/- 19 to 113 +/- 17 beats/min (p less than .01) in those not taking propranolol and from 97 +/- 14 to 92 +/- 12 beats/min (p less than .05) in those taking the drug. At a workload of 85% of pretraining maximum, heart rate similarly was lowered with training from 138 +/- 17 to 126 +/- 17 beats/min (p less than .01) in those not taking a beta-blocker and from 107 +/- 13 to 102 +/- 13 beats/min (p less than .02) in those taking propranolol. Thus patients with coronary disease who take propranolol have the same potential to benefit from physical training as patients who do not take beta-blockers, and exercise does not need to be modified because of the drug.", 
    "51": "We recorded a discrete 0.95 mV potential consistent with accessory atrioventricular pathway (AP) activation during serial electrophysiologic studies in a patient with Ebstein's anomaly and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Bipolar pacing from the catheter electrode in which the AP potential was recorded resulted in a stimulus-ventricle interval identical to the AP-ventricle interval during antegrade conduction, and a stimulus-atrium interval identical to the AP-atrium interval during retrograde conduction. With the patient in the drug-free state, antegrade AP block during atrial pacing and retrograde AP block during ventricular pacing occurred distal to the AP potential (AP-ventricle junction and AP-atrium junction, respectively), supporting the \"impedance mismatch\" hypothesis. Procainamide and disopyramide each lengthened the antegrade AP effective refractory period by affecting the AP-ventricle junction (possibly by decreasing the current generated by the AP). Both drugs also lengthened the retrograde AP effective refractory period but produced a greater effect on the ventricle-AP junction than on the AP-atrium junction, suggesting marginal geometry of the former. R wave synchronous shocks of 160 and 320 W-sec delivered between the catheter electrode recording the largest unipolar AP potential and a skin electrode produced transient, complete, antegrade block over the AP, suggesting the feasibility of this new nonsurgical technique for AP ablation.", 
    "52": "beta-Adrenergic receptors have been linked to the actions of beta-adrenergic agonists as well as that of other hormones on erythroid cells. In the present studies, arachidonic acid, the precursor for the endoperoxide intermediates for prostaglandins, was demonstrated to produce a significant increase in erythroid colony (CFU-E) formation in normal mouse bone marrow cultures. Meclofenamate, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor drug that inhibits prostaglandins synthesis, significantly inhibited the increase in CFU-E colony-forming cells produced by arachidonic acid, thus establishing that arachidonic acid was probably converted to some prostaglandin or prostaglandin metabolite in the bone marrow to trigger CFU-E. Prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) and D2 (PGD2), both of which have been demonstrated to be produced in the bone marrow, were found in the present studies to increase the number of CFU-E colonies in normal mouse bone marrow cultures. DL-Propranolol, a beta 1, beta 2-adrenergic blocking agent, and D-propranolol, a non-beta-blocking isomer with nonspecific membrane stabilizing effects, both produced a significant (P less than 0.01) inhibition of the effects of PGE2 or PGD2 on CFU-E in murine bone marrow cultures. Butoxamine, a somewhat selective beta 2-adrenergic antagonist drug, also produced a significant inhibition of the effects of PGE2 on CFU-E in murine marrow cultures. These results indicate that the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on prostaglandin-stimulated CFU-E are due to their membrane-stabilizing action rather than specific beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "53": "In 31 hypertensive patients the effect of chronic oral administration of the beta blocking agent propranolol on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied, using the non-invasive 133Xenon inhalation technique. The results of the measurements were compared to the rCBF obtained in an age-matched normal control group. Our study shows that during long-term therapy with low doses of propranolol (less than 120 mg/daily) the rCBF is unaffected, but it is increased significantly if higher doses (greater than 120 mg/daily) are used. In all six patients who served as their own control, as they had basic rCBF measurements before or during low-dose propranolol, the rCBF on high-dose propranolol became significantly increased. The possible mechanisms which may cause the increased rCBF on high-dose propranolol are discussed.", 
    "54": "In abdominal skins of toads (Bufo marinus) challenged with either vasopressin or isoproterenol, the stimulation of transepithelial water flow was accompanied by the appearance of intramembrane particle (IMP) aggregates. These aggregates were found only in the apical plasma membrane of granular cells of the first-reacting cell layer. The effect of vasopressin varied in magnitude and could be selectively blocked by preincubation of the skins with methohexital. This barbiturate also prevented the appearance of IMP aggregates. Preexposure with propranolol had a similar effect in skins challenged with isoproterenol. Linear regression analysis of net water flow vs. the percentage surface occupied by IMP aggregates showed a significant (P less than 0.001) correlation, which applied to data obtained in six different experimental conditions, i.e., vasopressin or isoproterenol alone and either of these agents in combination with methohexital or propranolol. The results reported here in a nonurinary epithelium (toad epidermis) suggest that the appearance of IMP aggregates is a general response in epithelia undergoing adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-mediated changes in water permeability.", 
    "55": "The effects of 0.5 mg of slow-release (sr) clonidine, 800 mg of acebutolol, and of both drugs combined on blood pressure and the water-salt balance were compared in 10 patients with essential hypertension. An initial placebo period was followed by three 72-h periods during which 5 patients were given sr-clonidine, acebutolol plus sr-clonidine, and acebutolol, respectively in that order whereas the other 5 received the same drugs in the opposite order. Placebo and active medications were given once a day, and the recorded variables were measured 24 h after the last intake. Sr-clonidine, acebutolol and their combined administration reduced mean blood pressure by 23, 16 and 39 mmHg, respectively, indicating first, that single daily doses of sr-clonidine and/or acebutolol constitute satisfactory antihypertensive treatments and second, that the interaction of these drugs is additive. All three treatments reduced plasma renin activity significantly and similarly. A reduction in plasma and urinary aldosterone was observed with sr-clonidine, and a decrease in plasma noradrenaline with the combined treatment. Both water diuresis and natriuresis rose significantly during combined therapy. The additive antihypertensive effects of sr-clonidine and acebutolol might be due to the parallel inhibition observed in the renin and sympathetic systems, and to the increase in natriuresis.", 
    "56": "Long-acting propranolol (Inderal LA) is a new formulation of propranolol that allows release of the drug in a controlled manner, so that the plasma concentration at 24 hr after dosing is greater with long-acting propranolol than with conventional tablets. A single dose of 160 mg of long-acting propranolol can produce cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade throughout a 24 hr period without variability due to multiple peak concentrations. It has been shown that this formulation is as effective in the treatment of angina pectoris, hypertension and hyperthyroidism as the standard formulation. Studies with long-acting propranolol in cardiac dysrhythmias are lacking. This new dosage form would be a means of simplifying dosing regimens and thereby hopefully enhancing patient convenience and compliance.", 
    "57": "Ten patients with essential hypertension were hospitalized and treated with placebo, followed by their usual dose of propranolol. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after the first dose of propranolol, and by the third day of propranolol treatment reached 84% to 92% of the maximum decrease achieved during the 6 days of treatment. Mean maximum falls in blood pressure were 13/12 mm Hg supine and 12/13 mm Hg standing. This development of the decrease in heart rate and blood pressure over 48 hours occurred in parallel with cumulation of propranolol to steady state in plasma. The decrease in diastolic, but not systolic, arterial pressure was directly related to pretreatment blood pressure, but not significantly related to pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) or change in PRA. Thus, single doses of propranolol lowered blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension, and with continued therapy, near maximum antihypertensive effects were achieved within 48 hours.", 
    "58": "In a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial 74 patients surviving a myocardial infarction (MI) were stress tested three and twelve months following MI. Thirty-eight patients received the beta blocking agent timolol and 36 patients received placebo. There was no significant difference in the mean total exercise capacity of the two groups. Most of the patients treated with timolol discontinued the exercise test because of exhaustion, but the placebo treated patients usually stopped the test because of chest pain, exhaustion or a fall in blood pressure. Patients treated with timolol had significantly less increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product during exercise compared to placebo. We conclude that beta-blockade with timolol after MI does not affect work capacity, but timolol-treated patients perform the same work with a lower rate-pressure product.", 
    "59": "To investigate the effect of propranolol and pindolol on renin and aldosterone secretion, blood samples of 12 nephrectomized kidney transplant recipients were taken after 1 hour in supine position and 30 and 60 minutes after posture change. This procedure was repeated after 4 days under pindolol (3 X 5 mg/day) or propranolol (4 X 40 mg/day). Both pindolol and propranolol suppressed the significant orthostatic rise of plasma renin activity (PRA) seen without medication. Pindolol increased basal PRA markedly, whereas basal PRA under propranolol was the same as without betablockers. Plasma aldosterone (PA) showed significant orthostatic rise under all conditions and thus did not parallel PRA under betablockers. Suppression of PRA response to posture change by betablockers indicates that circulating catecholamines may be involved in orthostatic PRA regulation. The intrinsic sympathetic activity of pindolol results in an increase of basal PRA. In nephrectomized renal transplant recipients, postural PA changes do not seem to be triggered by PRA.", 
    "60": "Forty-one patients completed a randomized, double-blind, between-group comparison of a combination of penbutolol and frusemide, with penbutolol alone, and frusemide alone in the management of mild to moderate essential hypertension. The results suggest that the combination caused a superior reduction in systolic and diastolic pressure compared with penbutolol and a superior reduction in systolic blood pressure compared with frusemide.", 
    "61": "Abnormalities in the serum lipid profile correlate strongly with the presence and severity of atherosclerosis. Increases in serum lipids and a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been demonstrated following treatment with some beta blockers and diuretics, either alone or in combination. A new alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist, trimazosin, was studied to determine its effects on serum lipids. Ninety-six hypertensive patients were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to trimazosin or placebo for 8 weeks. Trimazosin was associated with a significant reduction (p less than or equal to 0.01) in total cholesterol when compared with the placebo group. This effect was seen in all patients regardless of whether or not they were taking a diuretic concomitantly. In addition, a 9-month, double-blind parallel comparison was made of trimazosin and propranolol. Trimazosin was found to be superior to propranolol in its effect on HDL cholesterol and the HDL/total cholesterol ratio. These studies have demonstrated that, in contrast to placebo and propranolol, trimazosin lowers total serum cholesterol without undesirable effects on other serum lipid fractions. When polythiazide is given concomitantly, it diminishes the favorable effects of trimazosin and accentuates the opposite, adverse effects of propranolol.", 
    "62": "This report describes a double-blind, parallel, comparative study of trimazosin (+/- polythiazide) and propranolol (+/- polythiazide) in 130 patients with essential hypertension. Both treatment regimens were shown to be effective in achieving statistically significant sustained reduction in blood pressure. Propranolol alone was somewhat more effective, at the doses selected, than trimazosin alone, but the hypertension of nonresponders in each treatment group was effectively controlled by the addition of low doses of polythiazide. Trimazosin had no effect on heart rate, whereas propranolol significantly lowered resting heart rates, which was occasionally troublesome. Side effects were less frequent in the trimazosin-treated group. Trimazosin lowered serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, an effect significantly different from that of propranolol. There was also a tendency for serum uric acid to rise in patients receiving propranolol and fall in those receiving trimazosin; polythiazide significantly raised uric acid levels. The effects of trimazosin and propranolol on the lipid profile were small, but the difference between the increase in the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol fraction in trimazosin-treated patients and the decrease in propranolol-treated patients was significant and thought to be of interest.", 
    "63": "The present experiments were undertaken to determine: (1) whether bupropion had any direct effects on receptors present in rat brain; (2) whether the drug could down-regulate postsynaptic beta-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic, serotonergic, imipramine and dopaminergic receptors after chronic administration, as had been demonstrated for tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and \"atypical\" antidepressants. Bupropion was found to be weak or inactive when its affinity for 14 different receptors present in brain was assessed by binding assays. The drug failed to desensitize beta-adrenergic receptors in the cerebral cortex of the rat as determined by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding, after being administered at 25 mg/kg (i.p.) once a day for 6 weeks, or after being administered by the intraperitoneal route to rats at doses as large as 150 mg/kg per day for 4 days. When administered at doses of 37.5, 75 and 150 mg/kg per day for 21 days, the drug had no effect on beta-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic, imipramine or serotonergic (5-HT2) receptors in the brain of the rat as determined by Scatchard analysis of the binding data. These data show that the antidepressant activity of bupropion is not associated with a down-regulation of receptors in the CNS commonly implicated in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. Bupropion also produced a dose-dependent tendency to decrease the activity of norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in slices of cerebral cortex obtained from rats treated chronically with the drug. However, the decrease was highly variable, was most obvious in tissues obtained from rats receiving large, non-pharmacologically relevant doses (150 mg/kg per day) of the drug and was statistically significant at only one of three concentrations of the agonist that produced maximal stimulation of the enzyme.", 
    "64": "A specific beta-agonist, isoproterenol, increased the intracellular content of cyclic AMP and decreased the radiosensitivity of Chinese hamster fibroblasts. Beta-antagonist, propranolol, blocked the manifestation of the effect of isoproterenol. Isoproterenol did not affect either the intracellular level of cyclic AMP or the radiosensitivity of B-82 cells which had no beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "65": "We investigated the distribution of adrenergic receptors in ferret trachea using autoradiography. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol, used to identify beta-adrenoceptors, revealed a high density of specific binding sites over surface epithelium and submucosal glands, with less labelling of smooth muscle. [3H]prazosin labelling showed that alpha 1-receptors were numerous in glands and epithelium, but sparse in smooth muscle. Comparison of adrenergic receptor densities in tracheal sections from the same animals showed a rank order for submucosal glands of alpha 1 greater than beta, for epithelium beta greater than alpha 1 and for smooth muscle beta greater than alpha 1. Within the submucosal glands, alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors were differentially distributed, with alpha 1-receptors being significantly more numerous over serous than mucous cells and beta receptors being significantly more numerous over mucous than serous cells. This technique provides insight into adrenergic regulation of airway function and should be useful in investigations of how relative receptor densities may be altered in disease.", 
    "66": "To determine the effects of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha MSH) on the circulation of undisturbed fetal sheep and young lambs and to explore possible mechanisms of actions, we examined the responses of ascending aortic blood flow, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial blood pressure to a single intravenous injection of alpha MSH, ACTH, cortisol and to alpha MSH after beta-adrenergic blockade. We also measured cardiac output and organ blood flows before and after alpha MSH injection by the radionuclide labeled microsphere technique. alpha MSH increased ascending aortic blood flow from 249 +/- 23 to 327 +/- 30 ml X min-1 X kg-1 (P less than 0.001), heart rate from 111 +/- 10 to 126 +/- 11 min-1, (P less than 0.001) and stroke volume from 2.32 +/- 0.21 to 2.75 +/- 0.20 ml X kg-1, (P less than 0.001) in 10 young lambs 15-30-day-old. alpha MSH decreased mean systemic arterial blood pressure from 42.6 +/- 1.7 to 39.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P less than 0.001) in fetal sheep and min-1, (P less than 0.001) and stroke volume from 2.32 +/- 0.21 to 2.75 +/- 0.20 ml X kg-1, (P less than 0.001) in 10 young lambs 15-30-days-old. alpha MSH decreased mean systemic arterial blood pressure from 42.6 +/- 1.7 to 39.3 +/- 1.6 mmHg (P less than 0.001) in fetal sheep and from 77.5 +/- 4.5 to 72.7 +/- 4.3 mmHg (P less than 0.001) in young lambs. In six additional young lambs (20-35-day-old) cardiac output, measured by microspheres, increased with alpha MSH from 216 +/- 20 to 261 +/- 19 ml X min-1 X kg-1 (P less than 0.001). alpha MSH also increased blood flow to the myocardium from 104 +/- 22 to 151 +/- 26 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 (P less than 0.001), to the adrenals from 195 +/- 38 to 243 +/- 41 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1, (P less than 0.05), and to the lungs from 157 +/- 31 to 468 +/- 81 ml X min-1 X 100 g-1 (P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The role of phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipase A2 and lipid peroxidation in changes of the properties of beta-adrenoreceptors in rat brain synaptosomes in severe emotional painful stress (EPS) has been evaluated. It has been shown that EPS does not influence lipid and fatty acid content of synaptosomal membranes but significantly increases the amount of lipid peroxidation products. Activation of lipid peroxidation in EPS causes a decrease in specific binding of 3H-dihydroalprenolol. The free radical scavenger, 4-methyl-2,6-di(tret-butyl)phenol completely prevents activation of lipid peroxidation and eliminates the disturbances in ligand-receptor interactions in EPS.", 
    "68": "The haemodynamic dose-response effects of intravenous penbutolol, a newer beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity but without cardioselectivity, were evaluated in 10 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. Following four logarithmetically cumulative i.v. boluses (0.5-4 mg dosage range) there was a log linear increase in plasma penbutolol concentration; the levels achieved (51 +/- 8 to 219 +/- 19 ng/ml) were in the therapeutic range (12 to 250 ng/ml). Penbutolol resulted in a linear decrease in heart rate (maximum delta HR - 4 beats/min; P less than 0.01); there was a small increase in pulmonary artery occluded pressure which reached its maximum at the lower doses (maximum delta PAOP + 1 mm Hg; P less than 0.01). The resting cardiac output, blood pressure and calculated systemic vascular resistance were unchanged. During 4 min steady-state supine bicycle exercise there was attenuation of exercise cardiac output (delta C.I. - 0.6 1 min-1 m-2; P less than 0.01) and systolic pressor response (delta SBP - 13 mm Hg; P less than 0.01) compared with control observations without change in other measured or derived variables. The haemodynamic profile of penbutolol compared favourably with other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists previously evaluated under similar conditions in patients with ischaemic heart disease. Over the i.v. dose-range evaluated penbutolol attenuated exercise-induced angina with a relatively modest depression of cardiac performance; the small change induced in resting haemodynamic variables may, in part, have been contributed to by the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity of penbutolol.", 
    "69": "Effects of stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system on the bethanechol-induced increase in gastric acid secretion and mucosal blood flow (MBF) were studied in anesthetized, gastric fistula rats. The gastric acid secretion and MBF were increased by i.v. infusion of a supramaximal dose of bethanechol (10.0 micrograms/kg/min). The bethanechol-induced gastric acid secretion was abolished by administration of atropine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.), but was not influenced by hexamethonium (2.0 mg/kg i.v.) in the dose which abolished the gastric acid secretion induced by vagus nerve stimulation. Stimulation of the splanchnic postganglionic (SP) nerve or infusion of norepinephrine was carried out under the steady, increased state of acid secretion and MBF. Stimulation of the SP nerve significantly reduced the gastric acid secretion but the MBF was little affected. Thus, the delta MBF/delta H+ ratio was significantly increased during this stimulation. Intravenous infusion of norepinephrine also reduced the acid secretion without affecting the MBF. The delta MBF/delta H+ ratio was also significantly increased during infusion of norepinephrine. Phentolamine, but not propranolol, abolished the inhibitory effects of SP nerve stimulation and infusion of norepinephrine on the gastric acid secretion. These results suggest that the SP nerve acts on the structures peripheral to the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve terminals and directly inhibits the parasympathetically stimulated gastric acid secretion through alpha adrenoceptors, independently of changes in the gastric MBF in rats.", 
    "70": "The role of beta adrenergic receptors in the control of venous O2 saturation heterogeneity was studied in the left ventricular free wall of 24 anesthetized open-chest dogs. Venous and arterial O2 saturation was obtained microspectrophotometrically and combined with radioactive microsphere blood flow determinations to calculate regional myocardial O2 consumption. The mean and variance of venous O2 saturation were determined under six experimental conditions designed to produce graded levels of beta adrenergic activity. Regional O2 consumption, extraction and flow were also determined. Propranolol, 2 mg/kg, significantly lowered the O2 saturation variance in both small subepicardial and subendocardial veins compared to control. Isoproterenol, 10 micrograms/kg/min, did not alter the variance of venous O2 saturation. Isoproterenol, 10 micrograms/kg/min, in the presence of 2 mg/kg of propranolol was able to prevent the reduction in variance of venous O2 saturation seen with propropranolol alone. However, 0.1 microgram/kg/min of isoproterenol did not prevent this fall in venous O2 saturation variance with propranolol. Practolol, 1 mg/kg, also caused a significant fall in venous O2 saturation variance in the subepicardium and subendocardium. From this it can be concluded that there is an inhomogeneous distribution in beta-1 adrenergic receptor population and/or activity in the left ventricle. Thus, there appear to be small regions in the heart with high O2 consumption and extraction related to beta-1 adrenergic activity and/or distribution.", 
    "71": "The effects of moderate to severe renal impairment on kinetics of the H2-blocker ranitidine were investigated in 16 patients divided into two groups. Mean inulin clearance (ClIn) was 35 +/- 18.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 in group I and 7.4 +/- 3.5 ml/min/1.73 m2 in group II. Each patient received a single 150-mg oral dose of ranitidine. Values determined were maximum plasma concentration (MC) and time of occurrence, AUC, elimination t 1/2 (t 1/2 beta), total amount of unchanged ranitidine recovered in urine, and ranitidine renal clearance (ClR). MC values were higher and longer delayed than values reported in subjects with normal renal function. The t 1/2 beta was longer in group I and group II and correlated with the degree of renal impairment. The amount of ranitidine excreted within the first 24 hr decreased (18% of the dose in group I and 6% of the dose in group II), and ClR correlated strongly with ClIn, indicating that the observed changes in ranitidine kinetics are mainly related to changes in its renal excretion.", 
    "72": "The transmural distribution of alpha-receptor coronary vasoconstriction was studied in 14 closed-chest, morphine- and chloralose-anesthesized dogs. The alpha-receptor-blocking agent, phenoxybenzamine (0.25 mg/kg), was infused into either the anterior or circumflex coronary artery while collection of coronary sinus blood minimized recirculation. The left main coronary artery was cannulated and perfused at constant pressure. Myocardial lactate extraction and blood flow (9 micron radioactive microspheres) were measured during adrenergic activation with intracoronary norepinephrine (2 micrograms/min) at coronary artery pressures of 100, 70, 50, and 38 mm Hg. Flow was 15-25% less in the control region (alpha-receptors intact) than in the alpha-receptor-blocked region, in all layers of the left ventricular wall, at coronary pressures of 100 and 70 mm Hg. When coronary pressure was 50 mm Hg, lactate production resulted (-4% extraction) and significant alpha-receptor vasoconstriction was observed in the outer layer, but was marginal (P = 0.043) in the inner layer, of the left ventricle. Flows were not different in control and alpha-receptor-blocked regions at a coronary pressure of 38 mm Hg (lactate extraction -49%). These data indicate a uniform transmural alpha-receptor vasoconstriction at normal coronary artery pressures that diminished as the heart was progressively underperfused.", 
    "73": "We tried to assess relationships between echocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), arterial pressure levels, and plasma norepinephrine concentration (NE) in 20 previously untreated stable hypertensive patients with LVH, and in 11 healthy normotensive control subjects. Interventricular septal (IVS) thickness, posterior wall (PW) thickness, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were related to arterial pressure levels and to NE by univariate and multivariate regression analyses. In addition, after 18 months of monotherapy with atenolol (carried out in nine of 20 patients), the relationship between echocardiographic changes and degree of pressure reduction was tested. Before treatment, PW thickness weakly correlated with systolic (r = 0.55; p less than 0.01) and mean (r = 0.50; p less than 0.05) arterial pressure. IVS thickness weakly correlated with NE (r = 0.53; p less than 0.05). On this relatively small sample, multivariate regression analysis showed an association of both IVS thickness (R = 0.57; p less than 0.05) and PW thickness (R = 0.58; p less than 0.05) with mean arterial pressure (MAP) and NE. After atenolol, there was a reduction in IVS thickness (1.15 to 1.02 cm; p less than 0.01), PW thickness (1.08 to 0.99 cm; p less than 0.01), and LVMI (136.3 to 113.8 g/m2; p less than 0.01), besides a significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate. The degree of pressure reduction induced by treatment did not correlate the change in IVS or PW thickness. In contrast, the change in diastolic and mean arterial pressure positively correlated the change in LVMI (r = 0.72 and r = 0.75, respectively; both p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "The effects of a therapeutic dose of oral S-596 upon the cardiovascular response to intravenous isoproterenol and noradrenaline were studied in 2 hypertensive and 4 normotensive subjects in order to evaluate the drug's mode of action. After oral administration of S-596, mean blood pressure rose slightly and the heart rate decreased. In addition, cardiac output decreased considerably and total peripheral resistance increased. However pulmonary arterial end-diastolic pressure and right atrial pressure were not affected by S-596 administration. Before S-596, intravenous isoproterenol increased both heart rate and pulse pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, intravenous noradrenaline increased both systolic and diastolic pressures. Following 15 mg of S-596, the effects of isoproterenol were antagonized such that the cumulative log-dose-response curves of the mean isoproterenol-induced increases in heart rate and reductions in diastolic pressure were shifted in parallel to the right. At the same time, the mean noradrenaline-induced increases in blood pressure were also antagonized in a competitive manner. The mean ratio of alpha- and beta-components was calculated as: (formula: see text) From this result it can be suggested that the alpha-adrenoceptor blockade potency of this drug is approximately one-eight of its beta-adrenoceptor blockade potency.", 
    "75": "Synthetic bovine parathyroid hormone fragment containing the N-terminal 1-34 amino acids (bPTH-(1-34) ) relaxed the guinea-pig trachea constricted with histamine in vitro. Peptides with bovine and human sequences purchased from Peninsula Laboratories and Beckman Bioproducts produced similar effects. Substitution of methionine in positions 8 and 18 by norleucine did not affect this property of bPTH-(1-34). However, when the methionines were oxidized by treating the peptide with hydrogen peroxide, the peptide could no longer produce relaxation in the trachea. Oxidation of the methionine-replaced analog did not affect the action of the peptide on the trachea. It seems that the methionines per se are not necessary, but once oxidized the conformation of the molecule may be sufficiently altered to affect its ability to relax the trachea. While propranolol can block the relaxing action of isoproterenol, this blocking agent produces no inhibition of the bPTH-(1-34) effect. This action of PTH on the trachea may be related to cAMP because isobutyryl-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, potentiates and imidazole, a phosphodiesterase stimulator, inhibits the trachea relaxing action of bPTH-(1-34)."
