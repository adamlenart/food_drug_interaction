Patients with cerebrovascular and blood disease; taking drugs affecting blood e.g.: cytostatics, and erythropoietin; and patients taking insulin, beta blocker, or steroids were excluded. Data on age, gender, body weight, and body height were recorded. Examinations on fasting blood glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and routine blood were performed in the condition of ten hours of fasting. All laboratory examination was conducted at Prodia Laboratory, Yogyakarta.", 
    "2": "Of seventy one obese patients, 51.5% were male, and 9.1% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) during the study and the mean age was 47.09+5.74 years, the mean body mass index was 28.07+4.07 kg/m(2), the mean of hemoglobin level was 13.75+1.57 g%; the mean of leukocyte count was 7.86+1.19 103/mm(3); erythrocytes count was 4.93+0.44 106/mm(3); platelet count 300.28+80.57 103/mm(3); and hematocrite count 41.23+4.28. There were very weak and statistically insignificant negative correlation between Log HOMA IR and erythrocytes (r= -0.048; p=0.693)",

    "4": "The present study was to assess whether nebivolol could activate beta(3)-adrenergic receptors (ARs) in the human heart.", 
    "5": "Nebivolol is a third-generation beta-blocker used in the treatment of heart failure. It associates selective beta(1)-adrenergic antagonist properties with endothelial and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation. Several studies reported that this vasodilation could result from an activation of beta(3)-ARs, but no data are available in the heart.", 
    "6": "The effect of nebivolol (0.1 nmol/l to 10 micromol/l) upon the developed peak tension was tested in endomyocardial biopsies from human nonrejecting transplanted hearts. Tension was recorded at steady state using a mechanoelectric force transducer.", 
    "7": "Nebivolol induced a concentration-dependent decrease in peak tension (maximum effect obtained at 10 micromol/l: -55 +/- 4%, n = 6), which was similar to that obtained with a preferential beta(3)-AR agonist, BRL 37344 (maximum effect obtained at 1 micromol/l: -45 +/- 2%, n = 12). The nebivolol effect was not modified by 10 micromol/l nadolol, a beta(1,2)-AR antagonist, but was significantly reduced in the presence of 1 micromol/l L-748,337, a selective beta(3)-AR antagonist, and after pre-treatment with 100 micromol/l N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine, an NOS inhibitor.", 
    "8": "Our study demonstrated that nebivolol activated beta(3)-AR in the human ventricle. The NO-dependent negative inotropic effect of nebivolol associated with its vasodilating properties previously described in human microcoronary arteries could improve the energetic balance in heart. Those effects could explain the improvement of hemodynamic parameters obtained in patients with heart failure after nebivolol administration as previously described in clinical trials.", 
    "9": "Our interest was to find out whether pineal gland and their by melatonin act as modulator of immunosenescence. Parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) - a beta adrenergic blocker, is known to perform chemical pinealectomy (Px) by suppressing indirectly the substrate 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) for melatonin synthesis and thereby melatonin itself. The role of PCPA, alone and in combination with melatonin was recorded in immunomodulation and free radical load in spleen of young adult and aged seasonal breeder Indian palm squirrel Funambulus pennanti.", 
    "10": "Aged squirrel presented reduced immune parameters (i.e. total leukocyte count (TLC), Lymphocytes Count (LC), % stimulation ratio of splenocytes (% SR) against T cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) to oxazolone) when compared to young adult group. Melatonin administration (25 microg/100 g body mass/day) significantly increased the immune parameters in aged more than the young adult squirrel while PCPA administration (4.5 mg/100 g body mass/day) reduced all the immune parameters more significantly in young than aged. Combination of PCPA and melatonin significantly increased the immune parameters to the normal control level of both the age groups. TBARS level was significantly high in aged than the young group. PCPA treatment increased TBARS level of young and aged squirrels both while melatonin treatment decreased it even than the controls. Nighttime peripheral melatonin level was low in control aged group than the young group. Melatonin injection at evening hours significantly increased the peripheral level of nighttime melatonin, while combined injection of PCPA and melatonin brought it to control level in both aged and young adult squirrels.", 
    "11": "PCPA suppressed immune status more in aged than in adult by reducing melatonin level as it did chemical Px. Melatonin level decreased in control aged squirrels and so there was a decrease in immune parameters with a concomitant increase in free radical load of spleen. Decreased immune status can be restored following melatonin injection which decreased free radical load of spleen and suggest that immune organs of aged squirrels were sensitive to melatonin. Increased free radical load and decreased peripheral melatonin could be one of the reasons of immunosenescence.", 
    "12": "Ophthalmoplegic migraine (OM) is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent oculomotor nerve palsy in children, following migraine headaches. We report 62 adults, seen consecutively, who developed acute ophthalmoplegia with severe attacks of migraine over a 10-year (1996-2005) period. An overwhelming majority of these patients had an antecedent worsening in severity of migraine headaches, before the ophthalmoplegic attack.", 
    "13": "Sixty-two patients, aged 15-68 years, with an acute attack of OM underwent detailed clinical, biochemical, and neuroradiological evaluation.", 
    "14": "There were 62 patients with 86 attacks of OM. Whereas 48 patients had a single attack, 14 had 2 or more attacks, fulfilling the International Headache Society criteria for probable and definite OM, respectively. At presentation, isolated abducens, oculomotor, and trochlear nerve involvements were seen in 35 (56.5%), 21 (33.9%), and 5 (8.1%) patients, respectively. One patient had simultaneous involvement of 3rd and 6th nerves. Fifty-one (82.3%) patients exhibited an antecedent worsening in severity of migraine, before developing ophthalmoplegia during (59/95.2%) or within 24 hours (3/4.8%) of a severe migraine attack, respectively. Detailed biochemistry and cranial neuroimaging were normal. No case had any nerve enhancement. Use of steroids hastened recovery (P < .05).", 
    "15": "We conclude: (1) OM in adults is characterized by single attacks of ophthalmoplegia in a great majority of patients; and (2) 6th nerve involvement occurs commonly. Our results indicate that moving OM to the chapter on cranial neuralgias in the second edition of the International Headache Classification may be premature, since nerve palsy occurred during a severe migraine attack in all patients.",

    "17": "Contact lenses were incubated in a source solution containing timolol maleate or brimonidine tartrate to determine uptake kinetics. The lenses were then immersed in fresh saline to determine release kinetics. Analysis was performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC column retention times were determined for drugs released from the lens individually and under co-elution conditions. To evaluate clinical feasibility and toxicity, three volunteers (patients being treated for glaucoma) were provided with contact lenses that had been passively impregnated with either drug. After a three-week wash-out period, the volunteers were instructed to wear the lenses for 30 minutes per day for two weeks.", 
    "18": "HPLC analysis showed that maximum uptake and release of both drugs had occurred by approximately 60 minutes, with the slopes tending to flatten after this point. The retention time on the HPLC column was 8.08 minutes for timolol maleate and 2.16 minutes for brimonidine tartrate after incubation for one hour, with no changes after seven hours. Patient data showed that use of the lenses maintained IOP at levels equivalent to those obtained with previous treatment. No ocular toxicity was observed.", 
    "19": "Drugs commonly used for glaucoma treatment can be passively transferred to a hydrogel contact lens and then eluted from the polymer. Data obtained from a limited number of patients suggest that this contact lens/drug delivery system may be a feasible means of controlling IOP.",

After over 3 years' follow-up we have no found fatal or not varices related complications. Five patients died from hepatic failure. Recent literature highlights endoscopic band ligation usefulness because of favourable cost-effectiveness ratio and good quality of life in well selected patients treated by a skilled endoscopic team.", 
    "21": "We report one case of cardiac arrest related to ciprofloxacin administration. One female patient (aged 70 years old) developed a marked QTc prolongation (QTc = 0.62 s) within 24 hours of ciprofloxacin administration, with documented torsades de pointes and recurrent syncope that required defibrillation. The patient was under amiodarone and sotalol therapy for atrial fibrillation, with no obvious QT prolongation prior to ciprofloxacin therapy. QT prolongation and subsequent torsades de pointes appeared only after initiation of ciprofloxacin and normalized after drug discontinuation. Even though ciprofloxacin is thought to be safer than other agents in its class, it may cause QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, particularly in high risk patients with predisposing factors. Prolongation of the QT interval related to the effect of fluoroquinolones on rapid potassium channels (IKr) may result on potentially serious proarrhythmic effect, leading to torsades de pointes.", 
    "22": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the leading causes of cancer deaths and is unresponsive to existing therapy. Smoking and alcohol-induced pancreatitis are among the risk factors for PDAC. We have previously reported that beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) stimulate the proliferation and migration of human PDAC cells in vitro by cAMP-dependent signaling and that the nicotine-derived nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) activates this pathway directly in vitro while additionally stimulating the release of noradrenaline/adrenaline by binding to alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7 nAChR) in hamsters. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the beta-AR antagonist propranolol prevents the development of PDAC induced in hamsters with ethanol-induced pancreatitis by NNK. We found that propranolol had strong cancer preventive effects in this animal model. Western blots of pancreatic duct cells and PDAC cells harvested by laser capture microscopy showed significant upregulation of the alpha7 nAChR associated with significant inductions of p-CREB, p-ERK1/2, and increases in epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in PDAC cells of hamsters not treated with propranolol. These effects were reversed by treatment with propranolol. Our data suggest that propranolol may prevent the development of PDAC by blocking cAMP-dependent intracellular signaling, cAMP-dependent release of epidermal growth factor, and PKA-dependent release of vascular endothelial growth factor while additionally downregulating the alpha7 nAChR by inhibiting cAMP-mediated subunit assembly. We conclude that increased cAMP signaling is an important factor that drives the development and progression of PDAC and that the inhibition of cAMP formation is a promising new target for the prevention and adjuvant therapy of PDAC.",

    "24": "A systematic review of published clinical trials of latanoprost/timolol and other competitors was conducted in Medline, Embasse and Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register, between 2000 and 2007. Statistical analysis included calculation of the odds ratio (OR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) using the fixed effects model of Mantel-Haenszel and the random effects model of Der Simonian and Laird. To assess the heterogeneity between trials the Cochrane Q test and the I(2) rate were calculated. The conjunctival hyperemia rates obtained were compared with the Chi-square test.", 
    "25": "A total of 8 clinical trials comparing latanoprost/timolol fixed combination with different therapeutic options were found. As trial heterogeneity was moderate (Q: 14.64; df=7; p=0.041; I(2)= 52.2%) a random effects model was used. The final OR was 0.47 (CI 95%: 0.24-0.90); p = 0.024. The total conjunctival hyperemia incidence was 2.9% in the latanoprost/timolol group and 7.0% for the competitors (p<0.0001).",

    "27": "Underlying causes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or complex ventricular arrhythmias (VA) should be treated if possible. Antiarrhythmic drugs should not be administered to treat asymptomatic individuals with complex VA and no heart disease. Beta-blockers are the only antiarrhythmic drugs that have been documented to reduce mortality in patients with VT or complex VA. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of VT has been beneficial in treating selected patients with arrhythmogenic foci of monomorphic VT. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) is the most effective treatment for patients with life-threatening VT or ventricular fibrillation. Patients with AICDs should be treated with biventricular pacing, not with dual-chamber rate-responsive pacing at a rate of 70/min. Patients with AICDs should also be treated with beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin blockers.", 
    "28": "Hemolysis is one of the potentially serious complications of prosthetic heart valves. It is usually associated with either structural deterioration or paravalvular leak. Mild, compensated hemolysis associated with mechanical heart valves is not uncommon even in the current era. Severe hemolysis is rare, however, and usually reflects paravalvular leak. The use of transesophageal echocardiography-guided operative techniques may help prevent or minimize early postoperative paravalvular leakage. There is a gamut of available therapeutic approaches-medical, transcatheter, and surgical-to this complication and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient. Novel pharmacological agents include erythropoietin and pentoxifylline. Several reports described the feasibility of transcatheter closure of paravalvular leak with coils or devices, but their effect on hemolysis is unpredictable. Surgery remains the treatment of choice in severe cases.",

After 1 week of each treatment, the bronchodilator response to salbutamol was measured after first inducing bronchoconstriction using methacholine. Exercise capacity was assessed using the incremental shuttle walk test.", 
    "32": "Eleven patients with moderate COPD were recruited. Treatments were well-tolerated although two did not participate in the high-dose metoprolol phase. The area under the salbutamol-response curve was lower after propranolol compared with placebo (P=0.0006). The area under the curve also tended to be lower after high-dose metoprolol (P=0.076). The per cent recovery of the methacholine-induced fall was also lower after high-dose metoprolol (P=0.0018). Low-dose metoprolol did not alter the bronchodilator response. Oxygen saturation at peak exercise was lower with all beta-blocker treatments (P=0.046).", 
    "33": "Non-selective beta-blockers and high doses of cardio-selective beta-blockers may inhibit the bronchodilator response to beta2-agonists in patients with COPD. Beta-blockers were also associated with lower oxygen saturation during exercise. The clinical significance of these adverse effects is uncertain in view of the benefits of beta-blocker treatment for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "34": "Type 2 melastatin-related transient receptor potential channel (TRPM2), a member of the melastatin-related TRP (transient receptor potential) subfamily is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel activated by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). We have investigated the role of TRPM2 channels in mediating the H(2)O(2)-induced increase in the cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in insulin-secreting cells. In fura-2 loaded INS-1E cells, a widely used model of beta-cells, and in human beta-cells, H(2)O(2) increased [Ca(2+)](i), in the presence of 3 mM glucose, by inducing Ca(2+) influx across the plasma membrane. H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) influx was not blocked by nimodipine, a blocker of the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels nor by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, a blocker of several TRP channels and store-operated channels, but it was completely blocked by N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA), a potent inhibitor of TRPM2. Adenosine diphosphate phosphate ribose, a specific activator of TRPM2 channel and H(2)O(2), induced inward cation currents that were blocked by ACA. Western blot using antibodies directed to the epitopes on the N-terminal and on the C-terminal parts of TRPM2 identified the full length TRPM2 (TRPM2-L), and the C-terminally truncated TRPM2 (TRPM2-S) in human islets. We conclude that functional TRPM2 channels mediate H(2)O(2)-induced Ca(2+) entry in beta-cells, a process potently inhibited by ACA.",

It shows the low detection rate of nonspecific lung diseases in patients with pulmonary diseases. The high error rate has been established in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis at health care facilities. There is evidence that the use of current therapy for bronchial obstructive syndrome with inhaled cholinolytics and beta2-agonists in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis causes a reduction in the intensity of respiratory symptoms and an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second.",

Impairment of the cardiac sympathetic nerve activity is seen in about 50% of the sarcoidosis patients with small fiber neuropathy. In this case we present a sarcoidosis patient with small fiber neuropathy and cardiac symptoms with a cardiac sympathetic dysfunction, assessed with I-123 MIBG SPECT. After 5 months of treatment with carvedilol, which has besides adrenergic receptor blocking effects also antioxidant action, we saw a clear improvement of the cardiac sympathetic function demonstrated on a repeated I-123 MIBG SPECT.

    "41": "We investigated the effects of labetalol and pindolol on uterine, placental, and fetal hemodynamics following norepinephrine-induced maternal hypertension in a sheep model of increased placental vascular resistance. Also, we examined fetal and placental hemodynamic responses to acute hypoxemia after antihypertensive medication. Norepinephrine increased maternal heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and uterine vascular resistance (R(UtA)), and decreased uterine volume blood flow (Q(UtA)). Both labetalol and pindolol decreased maternal HR, MAP, and R(UtA), but did not restore Q(UtA). Fetal MAP was unaffected while fetal HR and placental volume blood flow (Q(UA)) decreased and placental vascular resistance increased. During hypoxemia, which was induced by decreasing maternal inspiratory oxygen fraction, all these parameters remained unchanged in the labetalol group while fetal HR increased and Q(UA) further decreased in the pindolol group. We conclude that labetalol and pindolol may compromise uterine and placental hemodynamics. Hypoxemic stress provokes divergent hemodynamic responses in fetuses exposed to these differently acting adrenoceptor antagonists.",

The objective of this study was to determine the dosing, efficacy and side effects of carvedilol for the management of dilated cardiomyopathy in children. Sixteen children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, aged 7 months to 138 months and with an ejection fraction less than 40%, were treated with carvedilol. The average initial dose was 0.1 mg/kg/day and it was uptitrated to 0.4 mg/kg/day.

These effects appear to be due to the activation of neurokinin-1 receptors. The present study investigated the influences of paclitaxel and vinorelbine on the substance P (sP) release from cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells using a radioimmunoassay. Both paclitaxel and vinorelbine evoked sP release in a dose- and time-dependent manner within 60 min at a concentration range of 0.1-10 microM. The sP release levels induced by the two drugs were attenuated by pretreatment with the protein kinase Cs (PKCs) inhibitors (bisindolylmaleimide I and G\u00f66976). Moreover, the paclitaxel- or vinorelbine-induced sP release was diminished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ or the presence of LaCl3 (an extracellular Ca2+ influx blocker). A Ca2+ imaging assay further indicated that both paclitaxel and vinorelbine gradually increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, and these increases lasted for at least 15 min and were suppressed by G\u00f66976. Paclitaxel caused the membrane translocation of only PKCbeta within 10 min after stimulation, whereas vinorelbine induced the translocation of both PKCalpha and beta. The paclitaxel- and vinorelbine-induced sP release levels were separately inhibited by ruthenium red (a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel blocker) and gabapentin (an inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs)). These findings suggest that paclitaxel and vinorelbine evoke the sP release from cultured DRG cells by the extracellular Ca2+ influx through TRP channels activated by PKCbeta and VGCCs activated by both PKCalpha and beta, respectively.",

Using DSM LV parameters were not statistically different between DSCT and CMR in all patients (DSCT vs. CMR: EF 63+/-8% vs. 64+/-8%, p=0.47; EDV 136+/-36 ml vs. 138+/-35 ml, p=0.66; ESV 52+/-21 ml vs. 52+/-22 ml, p=0.61; SV 83+/-22 ml vs. 87+/-19 ml, p=0.22; CO 5.4+/-0.9l/min vs. 5.7+/-1.2l/min, p=0.09, LVM 132+/-33 g vs. 132+/-33 g, p=0.99). 2. In a subgroup of 15 patients beta-blockade prior to DSCT resulted in a lower ejection fraction (EF), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and increase in end systolic volume (ESV) in DSCT (EF 59+/-8% vs. 62+/-9%; SV 73+/-17 ml vs. 81+/-15 ml; CO 5.7+/-1.2l/min vs. 5.0+/-0.8 l/min; ESV 52+/-27 ml vs. 57+/-24 ml, all p<0.05). 3. Analyzing the RGA parameters LV volumes were not significantly different compared to DSM, whereas LVM was higher using RGA (177+/-31 g vs. 132+/-33 g, p<0.05). Interobserver agreement was excellent comparing DSM values with best agreement between RGA calculations.", 
    "58": "Left ventricular volumes and mass can reliably be assessed by DSCT compared to CMR. However, beta-blocker administration leads to statistically significant reduced EF, SV and CO, whereas ESV significantly increases. DSCT RGA reliably analyzes LV function, whereas LVM is overestimated compared to DSM.",

    "60": "In rabbits, a partial-thickness skin donor site wound was created on the back, and catheters were placed in the carotid artery and jugular vein. A nasogastric feeding tube was placed for enteral feeding. On day 5 after injury, stable isotope tracers were infused to determine protein and DNA kinetics in the wound. Propranolol hydrochloride was injected in 1 group during the tracer infusion to decrease heart rate, and the other group without propranolol injection served as a control.", 
    "61": "The propranolol infusion decreased heart rate by 21%. The protein fractional synthetic rate in the wound was greater in the propranolol group (8.6 +/- 0.9 vs 6.1 +/- 0.5%/day, P < .05). Wound protein fractional breakdown rates were not significantly different. The rate of protein deposition (synthesis - breakdown) was increased in the propranolol group (5.0 +/- 1.2 vs 2.8 +/- 0.7%/day, P = .07). Wound DNA fractional synthetic rates were comparable. The protein fractional synthetic rate was correlated with percent decrease in heart rate, but expression of the beta-adrenergic receptors and downstream signaling cascades in local wounds were not affected after propranolol treatment.", 
    "62": "Propranolol infusion increased wound protein synthetic rate and tended to increase wound protein deposition rate, which might be beneficial to wound healing. These changes might reflect a systemic response to the beta-adrenergic blockade.", 
    "63": "In Brazilian folk medicine, extracts from Piper species are used to reduce blood pressure. Previously, we demonstrated the vasodilatory activity of crude extracts from leaves of Piper truncatum explaining their possible use in the treatment of hypertension in traditional medicine. In the present study, we investigated the effects of eudesmin, a lignan isolated from hexane extract of leaves from Piper truncatum, on the contractility of rat aortas and the possible mechanisms involved in its vascular action. Eudesmin induced an intense concentration-dependent relaxation of aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine. The concentration of eudesmin necessary to reduce phenylephrine-induced aortic contraction by 50% (IC(50)) was 10.69+/-0.67 microg/ml. Eudesmin-induced vasodilation required an intact endothelium since vascular relaxation was inhibited by mechanic removal of endothelium, and by pretreatment with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor. Relaxation induced by eudesmin was also impaired in the presence of indomethacin and diphenhydramine, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor and an antagonist of type 1 histamine receptor (H(1)), respectively. IC(50) was increased to 18.1+/-1.8 and 18.1+/-2.6 microg/ml (P<0.05; n=6) after exposure to indomethacin and diphenhydramine, respectively. Atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist), propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) and glibenclamide (ATP-sensitive K(+) channel blocker) did not alter the effect of eudesmin. These results indicate that eudesmin-induced vascular relaxation in rat aorta is mediated by release of nitric oxide and prostanoid through the involvement of histamine receptor present in the endothelial cells.",

    "68": "In this study, we tried to compare the efficacy and safety of betaxolol vs. metoprolol immediately postoperatively in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients and to determine whether prophylaxy for atrial fibrillation (AF) with betaxolol could reduce hospitalization and economic costs after cardiac surgery. Our trial was open-label, randomized, multicentric enrolling 1352 coronary surgery patients randomized to receive betaxolol or metoprolol. The primary endpoints were the composites of 30-day mortality, in-hospital AF (safety endpoints), duration of hospitalization and immobilization, quality of life, and the above endpoint plus in-hospital embolic event, bradycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, cold extremities (efficacy plus safety endpoint). At the end of the study the incidence and probability of early postoperative AF with betaxolol was lower than with metoprolol in coronary surgery (P<0.0001). In the two study groups minor side effects were similar and no major complication was reported (P<0.001). Patient compliance was good and the general condition improved due to shortened hospitalization and immobilization with subsequent improvement in the psychological status, less arrhythmias and lack of significant side effects. In conclusion, because of its efficacy and safety, betaxolol was superior to metoprolol for the prevention of the early postoperative AF in coronary surgery.", 
    "69": "Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of the peripheral immune system in delayed cellular degeneration after stroke. In the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke, the spleen decreases in size. This reduction occurs through the release of splenic immune cells. Systemic treatment with human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) 24 h post-stroke blocks the reduction in spleen size while significantly reducing infarct volume. Splenectomy 2 weeks prior to MCAO also reduces infarct volume, further demonstrating the detrimental role of this organ in stroke-induced neurodegeneration. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system after MCAO results in elevated catecholamine levels both at the level of the spleen, through direct splenic innervation, and throughout the systemic circulation upon release from the adrenal medulla. These catecholamines bind to splenic alpha and beta adrenoreceptors. This study examines whether catecholamines regulate the splenic response to stroke. Male Sprague-Dawley rats either underwent splenic denervation 2 weeks prior to MCAO or received injections of carvedilol, a pan adrenergic receptor blocker, prazosin, an alpha1 receptor blocker, or propranolol, a beta receptor blocker. Denervation was confirmed by reduced splenic expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. Denervation prior to MCAO did not alter infarct volume or spleen size. Propranolol treatment also had no effects on these outcomes. Treatment with either prazosin or carvedilol prevented the reduction in spleen size, yet only carvedilol significantly reduced infarct volume (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that circulating blood borne catecholamines regulate the splenic response to stroke through the activation of both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors.", 
    "70": "We have unexpectedly found expression of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) in human adrenocortical cells and tested the hypothesis that these cells contain the components of an aldosterone response pathway. Tissue was obtained from patients undergoing adrenalectomy and mRNA and protein expression of recognised components of an aldosterone-response pathway were determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The effects of mineralocorticoid receptor agonists and antagonists, amiloride analogues, and extracellular Na(+) on basal and stimulated aldosterone release from immortalised (H295R) cells were determined by radioimmunoassay. Expression of mRNA for alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits of ENaC, the mineralocorticoid receptor, Nedd4L, Sgk1 and 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II was confirmed in human adrenal cortex. Using Western blotting alpha-, beta- and gamma-ENaC expression was demonstrated in adrenocortical cells. Measurements of 24 h aldosterone release from H295R cells showed stimulation by K(+) and angiotensin II, suppression by both Na(+) and high-concentration 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA, blocker of Na(+)-H(+) exchange) and no change with benzamil (ENaC blocker). (22)Na-uptake into H295R cells was inhibited by EIPA, but not by benzamil. Our experiments suggest that the components of an aldosterone response pathway are present in human adrenal cortex. Studies in H295R cells, however, suggest that ENaC is not an important mediator of (22)Na-uptake or aldosterone production. Further studies are required to determine the importance of an adrenal aldosterone response pathway.", 
    "71": "Typical presentations of hyperthyroidism are palpitation, nervousness, tremor, malaise, and weight loss. Hyperthyroidism affects nearly every system in the body, and some patients may manifest neurologic or hematologic symptoms. Atypical presentations of hyperthyroidism often pose a great challenge in diagnosis and treatment. We report a case of Basedow's paraplegia and pancytopenia that was precipitated by hyperthyroidism. The unusual manifestations led to unnecessary examinations and delayed the treatment of hyperthyroidism. The classical symptoms of Basedow's paraplegia are subacute symmetric weakness of the lower extremities with areflexia and sparing sensation or sphincter involvement. Control of the hyperthyroidism mitigated the neurologic and hematologic complications and prevented unnecessary studies.", 
    "72": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurs in healthy children and young adults causing syncope and sudden cardiac death. This is a familial disease, which affect de novo mutation in 50% of the cases. At least two causative genes have been described to be localized in the chromosome 1; mutation of the ryanodine receptor gene and calsequestrin gene. The classical clinical presentation is syncope triggered by exercise and emotion in children and adolescents with no structural heart disease. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia during treadmill testing, or after isoproterenol infusion, is the most common feature. Therapeutic options include, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers and, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is indicated in high-risk patients. Risk stratification of this disease is very challenging, since some risk factors proved to be useful in some series but not in others. However, family history of sudden cardiac death and symptoms initiated in very young children are important predictors.", 
    "73": "In heart disease, differences exist between women and men with respect to the impact of risk factors, symptoms, and therapeutic responses. The use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers is now well established in the treatment of mild and moderate systolic heart failure. Although there are significant differences among agents, their clinical effects are predictable. To address the question of sex disparities in the heart, however, we investigated the effect of treatment with the nonselective beta-blockers timolol and propranolol on mechanical and electrical function of heart preparations from male and female rats. We examined the long-term effects of intragastric treatment with timolol (5 mg/kg per day) or propranolol (25 mg/kg per day) for 7 months on the hemodynamic and intracellular action potential parameters of the heart. Chronic administration of timolol but not propranolol produced a significant increase in the baseline activity of the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) in both male and female rats with no significant effect on the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Timolol or propranolol treatment of male rats and timolol but not propranolol treatment of female rats induced significant shortening in the repolarization phases of action potentials recorded from left ventricular papillary muscle strips of the hearts. The responses of LVDP to beta-adrenergic stimulation were similar in timolol- or propranolol-treated or untreated male rats. On the other hand, timolol treatment markedly increased, and propranolol treatment significantly decreased, the responses of increase in LVDP in female rats. Our results suggest that although treatment with beta-blockers for 7 months confirmed the role of the beta-adrenergic pathway in heart function, there are marked differences in the effects of individual beta-blockers on heart physiology. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when using beta-blockers during experimental studies and clinical therapy.", 
    "74": "In sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a severe prognostically relevant cardiac autonomic dysfunction exists, as manifested by a strong attenuation of sympathetically and vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV). The mechanisms underlying this attenuation are not limited to the nervous system. They also include alterations of the cardiac pacemaker cells on a cellular level. As shown in human atrial cardiomyocytes, endotoxin interacts with cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, which mediate the pacemaker current If and play an important role in transmitting sympathetic and vagal signals on heart rate and HRV. Moreover, endotoxin sensitizes cardiac HCN channels to sympathetic signals. These findings identify endotoxin as a pertinent modulator of the autonomic nervous regulation of heart function. In MODS, the vagal pathway of the autonomic nervous system is particularly compromised, leading to an attenuation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory reflex. An amelioration of the blunted vagal activity appears to be a promising novel therapeutic target to achieve a suppression of the inflammatory state and thereby an improvement of prognosis in MODS patients. Preliminary data revealed therapeutic benefits (increased survival rates and improvements of the depressed vagal activity) of the administration of statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with MODS.",

This interval did not vary significantly between patients who underwent no treatment or were on a beta-blocker and/or ligation therapy. The serum bilirubin (hazard ratio 1.030; 95% confidence interval, 1.004, 1.055; P<0.03) was the only parameter independently associated with the progression of varices. Initial eradication of varices was achieved after 2.2+/-1.5 ligation sessions.

    "79": "Membrane trafficking is well known to regulate receptor-mediated signaling processes, but less is known about whether signaling receptors conversely regulate the membrane trafficking machinery. We investigated this question by focusing on the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR), a G protein-coupled receptor whose cellular signaling activity is controlled by ligand-induced endocytosis followed by recycling. We used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) and tagging with a pH-sensitive GFP variant to image discrete membrane trafficking events mediating B2AR endo- and exocytosis. Within several minutes after initiating rapid endocytosis of B2ARs by the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, we observed bright \"puffs\" of locally increased surface fluorescence intensity representing discrete Rab4-dependent recycling events. These events reached a constant frequency in the continuous presence of isoproterenol, and agonist removal produced a rapid (observed within 1 min) and pronounced (approximately twofold) increase in recycling event frequency. This regulation required receptor signaling via the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a specific PKA consensus site located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail of the B2AR itself. B2AR-mediated regulation was not restricted to this membrane cargo, however, as transferrin receptors packaged in the same population of recycling vesicles were similarly affected. In contrast, net recycling measured over a longer time interval (10 to 30 min) was not detectably regulated by B2AR signaling. These results identify rapid regulation of a specific recycling pathway by a signaling receptor cargo.",

In addition, reverse use-dependent prolongation of MAP duration was detected by electrical pacing, whereas the terminal repolarization period was hardly affected at any dose. Oral administration of 3 to 30 mg/kg dl-sotalol to conscious monkeys also decreased the HR and prolonged the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner.

On stepwise multivariable analyses, a higher plasma adiponectin concentration before treatment (rs=-0.561, P<0.0001) was a significant independent predictor of a greater decrease in adiponectin concentration and the decrease in plasma adiponectin concentration was significantly correlated with the improvement of LVEF (r=-0.561, P<0.0001).",

    "91": "Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest group of structurally related proteins encoded by the human genome. As signal effectors and allosteric regulators, GPCRs dynamically recruit not only specific heterotrimeric G proteins but also the cytosolic scaffold proteins, beta-arrestin 1 and 2, which were originally thought only to serve as negative regulators of GPCR signaling. Although about half of currently available therapeutics target GPCR function, usually at the ligand-binding, orthosteric site, evidence suggests that beta-arrestins may be therapeutic targets themselves. Indeed, a hitherto undiscovered action of various antipsychotics is to inhibit the ability of the dopamine D2 receptor to engage beta-arrestin 2 and activate glycogen synthase kinase 3, which may be a target for developing therapeutics for schizophrenia. Also, certain beta-antagonists (blockers) used to treat heart failure, such as carvedilol, have the added effect of promoting activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase through beta-arrestin. It seems likely that the structure of beta-arrestins allows them to detect different types and conformational states of GPCRs and to respond in functionally distinct fashions by using separate cohorts of signaling proteins, thus generating additional possibilities for therapeutic intervention.",

Data were obtained for 52 subjects, of which 27 had 2 functional alleles (24/27, CYP2D6*1/*1), 22 had 1 functional allele (18/22, CYP2D6*1/*4) and 3 had no functional alleles (CYP2D6*4/*4). Median dose-adjusted concentrations of S-metoprolol (active) were 6.3- and 3.2-fold higher in subjects with zero or one functional allele (P=0.016 and P=0.006), respectively, compared with subjects with two functional alleles. For the R-enantiomer (inactive), these concentrations were 10.7- and 3.7-fold higher (P=0.013 and P=0.003), respectively. Despite clear gene-concentration differences, no relationships between CYP2D6 genotype and dose or clinical effects could be shown.

Aortic contraction in response to norepinephrine is reduced and vasorelaxation is enhanced in response to beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AdR) agonists in vitro. Similarly, vascular smooth muscle cell-selective PPARgamma knockout mice display a biphasic response to norepinephrine in BP, reversible on administration of beta-AdR blocker, and enhanced BP reduction on treatment with beta-AdR agonists. Consistent with enhanced beta2-AdR responsiveness, we found that the absence of PPARgamma in vascular smooth muscle cells increased beta2-AdR expression, possibly leading to the hypotensive phenotype during the rest phase.",

    "104": "The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV), viewed traditionally as a passive membrane, is shown to be a highly active structure in the beating heart. Two types of leaflet contractile activity are demonstrated: 1) a brief twitch at the beginning of each beat (reflecting contraction of myocytes in the leaflet in communication with and excited by left atrial muscle) that is relaxed by midsystole and whose contractile activity is eliminated with beta-receptor blockade and 2) sustained tone during isovolumic relaxation, insensitive to beta-blockade, but doubled by stimulation of the neurally rich region of aortic-mitral continuity. These findings raise the possibility that these leaflets are neurally controlled tissues, with potentially adaptive capabilities to meet the changing physiological demands on the heart. They also provide a basis for a permanent paradigm shift from one viewing the leaflets as passive flaps to one viewing them as active tissues whose complex function and dysfunction must be taken into account when considering not only therapeutic approaches to MV disease, but even the definitions of MV disease itself.", 
    "105": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a rare inherited heart-muscle disease that is a cause of sudden death in young people and athletes. Causative mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins have been identified and the disease is nowadays regarded as a genetically determined myocardial dystrophy. The left ventricle is so frequently involved as to support the adoption of the broad term arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Clinical diagnosis can be achieved by demonstrating function and structure changes of the right ventricle, electrocardiogram depolarisation and repolarisation abnormalities, ventricular arrhythmias, and fibrofatty replacement through endomyocardial biopsy. Although specific, the standardised diagnostic criteria lack sensitivity for early disease and their primary application remains in establishing the diagnosis in probands. However, the main clinical targets are early detection of concealed forms and risk stratification for preventive strategies, which include physical exercise restriction, antiarrhythmic drugs, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. Cascade genetic screening of family members of gene-positive probands allows the identification of asymptomatic carriers who would require lifelong follow-up due to the age-related penetrance.", 
    "106": "An 18-year-old patient, who had polysplenia and single ventricle, presented with altered mental status 9 years after a Fontan-type operation and pacemaker implantation. He underwent replacement of common atrioventricular valve and aortic valve plasty 1 year previously and has been placed on multiple medications including beta-blocker for his poor ventricular function. Blood chemistry revealed hyperammonemia of 2420 microg/l as a cause of this altered mental status disturbance. Superior mesenteric arteriography revealed large portal-systemic shunts in venous phase as a cause of hyperammonemia. To control blood ammonia level, we placed him on low protein diet, oral polymixin B, and lactulose instead of closing shunt with device. This case illustrates that portal-systemic shunt may result in hyperammonemia leading to altered mental status long after a Fontan-type operation.",

    "112": "Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine uptake as well as a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, is commonly used in prophylactic therapy for patients with angina pectoris. However, the effects of dipyridamole on systemic blood vessels, especially on the peripheral vascular system, are not well understood. Therefore, the effect of dipyridamole on ATP-induced arteriole contraction was examined with special reference to intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) using real-time confocal microscopy. In cases of 0.1-10microM range, dipyridamole induced only slight [Ca(2+)](i) decreases in smooth muscle cells of both testicular and cerebral arterioles. However, 100microM dipyridamole induced substantial [Ca(2+)](i) decreases in the cells. In the presence of 10microM dipyridamole, changes in ATP-induced [Ca(2+)](i) were found to be inhibited in smooth muscle cells of testicular arterioles but not in those of cerebral arterioles. In addition, alpha, beta-methylene ATP-induced [Ca(2+)](i) increases in testicular arteriole smooth muscle cells were also partially inhibited in the presence of dipyridamole. When testicular arterioles were perfused with dipyridamole, no increases in nitric oxide levels were detected. High levels of K(+) induced a [Ca(2+)](i) increase in testicular arterioles that was also partially inhibited by dipyridamole. In the presence of substances that affect protein kinase A or G, ATP-induced [Ca(2+)](i) was not completely inhibited. These findings suggest that dipyridamole may act not only as an inhibitor of adenosine uptake and as a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, but also as a calcium channel blocker in arteriole smooth muscle cells.",

Such depots were defined as collections of tissue that were more than 4 mm in diameter, had the density of adipose tissue according to CT, and had maximal standardized uptake values of (18)F-FDG of at least 2.0 g per milliliter, indicating high metabolic activity.

Women also had a greater mass of brown adipose tissue and higher (18)F-FDG uptake activity. The probability of the detection of brown adipose tissue was inversely correlated with years of age (P<0.001), outdoor temperature at the time of the scan (P=0.02), beta-blocker use (P<0.001), and among older patients, body-mass index (P=0.007).",

    "127": "Altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing leading to increased production and oligomerization of Abeta may contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Understanding how APP processing is regulated under physiological conditions may provide new insights into AD pathogenesis. Recent reports demonstrate that excitatory neural activity regulates APP metabolism and Abeta levels, although understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved is incomplete. We have investigated whether NMDA receptor activity regulates APP metabolism in primary cultured cortical neurons. We report that a pool of APP is localized to the postsynaptic compartment in cortical neurons and observed partial overlap of APP with both NR1 and PSD-95. NMDA receptor stimulation increased nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase-mediated APP processing, as measured by a 2.5-fold increase in cellular alpha-C-terminal fragment (C83) levels after glutamate or NMDA treatment. This increase was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonists d-AP5 and MK801 but not by the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX or the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine, was prevented by chelation of extracellular calcium, and was blocked by the alpha-secretase inhibitor TAPI-1. Cotreatment of cortical neurons with bicuculline and 4-AP, which stimulates glutamate release and activates synaptic NMDA receptors, evoked an MK801-sensitive increase in C83 levels. Furthermore, NMDA receptor stimulation caused a twofold increase in the amount of soluble APP detected in the neuronal culture medium. Finally, NMDA receptor activity inhibited both Abeta1-40 release and Gal4-dependent luciferase activity induced by beta-gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of an APP-Gal4 fusion protein. Altogether, these data suggest that calcium influx through synaptic NMDA receptors promotes nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase-mediated APP processing.",

The purpose of this study is to explore the role of metoprolol on vulnerable plaque and the possible mechanism. Vulnerable plaque model was established by local transfection with p53 gene in New Zealand Rabbits. Metoprolol treatment attenuated vessel positive remodeling and reduced vulnerability index (1.61+/-0.58 vs. 2.33+/-0.12, P<0.01). Although the difference did not reach statistical significance, the rate of rupture of atherosclerotic plaque (31% vs. 75%) and intima-media thickness (0.05+/-0.01 vs. 0.08+/-0.01 cm) were less in the metoprolol group than in the control group. The level of shear stress-related inflammatory cytokines such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), were lower in the metoprolol group than in the control group (P<0.01). Compared with control group, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower (P<0.01) in the metoprolol group. After metoprolol treatment, shear stress increased, and was not different to baseline (physiological shear stress, P>0.05). Shear stress and vulnerability index showed a negative correlation. These findings suggest that metoprolol could inhibit the development of atherosclerosis and stabilize vulnerable plaque by regulation of lipid and reduction of inflammation, in which the change from low shear stress to physiological shear stress around plaque may play an important role.", 
    "133": "This study set out to investigate the impact of chronic cumulative blockade of angiotensin II and adrenoceptors in WKY and SHR and to explore how the renovascular responses to adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor agonists may be interdependent. Rats were treated with either losartan, carvedilol or losartan+carvedilol for 7 days and on day eight, animals were pentobarbitone anaesthetized and prepared for renal haemodynamic study. Dose-response relationships were determined in terms of reduction/elevation in the magnitude of renal blood flow in response to intrarenal arterial injection of dopamine, phenylephrine and isoprenaline. Renal vascular responses were blunted in WKY and SHR treated with either losartan or carvedilol as compared to their untreated counterparts (P<0.05). In the combined treated rats, the vascular responses to isoprenaline and phenylephrine were restored to levels observed in the untreated rats, but the renal vasoconstrictor responses to dopamine decreased (P<0.05) in both WKY and SHR. There was a reduction of (P<0.05) in the magnitude of the isoprenaline induced renal vasodilation in all SHR as compared to WKY groups. The data obtained showed that the renal vascular action of dopamine, phenylephrine and isoprenaline depended on an intact renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in WKY and SHR. Treatment with losartan or carvedilol blunted the renal vasoconstrictor/vasodilator responses to sympathomimetics which was attenuated with the combined treatment. These observations using chronic blockade of adrenergic and angiotensin receptors demonstrated that there was a long standing interdependency between the RAS and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in determining the responsiveness of the renal vasculature of normal and hypertensive rats.",

Insights into agonist binding and the corresponding conformational changes triggering G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activation mechanism are of special interest. Here we show that while the carazolol pocket captured in the beta(2)AR crystal structure accommodates (-)-isoproterenol and other agonists without steric clashes, a finite movement of the flexible extracellular part of TM-V helix (TM-Ve) obtained by receptor optimization in the presence of docked ligand can further improve the calculated binding affinities for agonist compounds. Tilting of TM-Ve towards the receptor axis provides a more complete description of polar receptor-ligand interactions for full and partial agonists, by enabling optimal engagement of agonists with two experimentally identified anchor sites, formed by Asp113/Asn312 and Ser203/Ser204/Ser207 side chains. Further, receptor models incorporating a flexible TM-V backbone allow reliable prediction of binding affinities for a set of diverse ligands, suggesting potential utility of this approach to design of effective and subtype-specific agonists for adrenergic receptors. Systematic differences in capacity of partial, full and inverse agonists to induce TM-V helix tilt in the beta(2)AR model suggest potential role of TM-V as a conformational \"rheostat\" involved in the whole spectrum of beta(2)AR responses to small molecule signals.",

There was no increase in tumor weight following surgery in the beta-adrenergic receptor-negative RMG-II model. Propranolol completely blocked the effects of surgical stress on tumor growth, indicating a critical role for beta-adrenergic receptor signaling in mediating the effects of surgical stress on tumor growth. In the HeyA8 and SKOV3ip1 models, surgery significantly increased microvessel density (CD31) and vascular endothelial growth factor expression, which were blocked by propranolol treatment.",

    "169": "In INternational VErapamil-trandolapril STudy, 22,576 CAD patients with hypertension (mean age 66 years) were randomized to verapamil-SR or atenolol-based strategies and followed for 2.7 years (mean). Primary outcome (PO) was time to first occurrence of death (all-cause), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non-fatal stroke. Mean follow-up PP was summarized by 5 mmHg subgroups for association with incidence of PO. Stepwise Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted relative hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of PO with follow-up PP as a continuous variable, with linear and quadratic terms. Similar models were constructed for follow-up systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressures (MAP). A -2 log-likelihood statistic was used to assess the predictive power of PP compared with SBP, DBP, and MAP. For follow-up PP, the incidence and adjusted HR for the PO formed a J- or U-shaped curve. After adjusting for baseline covariates, both linear and quadratic terms for PP were significant (P < 0.0001 for both), with a nadir of 54 mmHg (bootstrapping 95% CI 42-60 mmHg). Similar quadratic relationships were found between PP and all-cause mortality or MI; the relationship between PP and stroke was linear. Pulse pressure was a predictor of PO even after including SBP (P = 0.007 linear term) or DBP (P < 0.0001 for both linear and quadratic terms) or MAP (P < 0.01 for both liner and quadratic terms) in the model. Using -2 log-likelihood differences, SBP (-2 log-likelihood difference 77.1 vs. 7.3 for PP), DBP (-2 log-likelihood difference 138.5 vs. 44.6 for PP), and MAP (-2 log-likelihood difference 125.0 vs. 13.4 for PP) were stronger predictors of PO than PP.",

    "171": "The involvement of various neurotransmitter receptors in the brain in the regulation of spatial behavior is a focus of interest for many cognitive neuroscientists. Active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task have been demonstrated to require spatial mapping and cognitive coordination and is highly dependent upon hippocampus. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the modulation of locomotor and spatial behavior in this task. Four doses of centrally active beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5, 20, 25 and 30 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to testing in the place avoidance task. Four daily sessions were pursued, each lasting 20 min. A dose of 25 mg/kg was found to induce a deficit in spatial behavior (measured by number of entrances into the shock sector) without altering locomotion; lower doses were without effect. The highest dose (30 mg/kg) impaired both locomotion and avoidance behavior. The results suggest that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the regulation of behavior in the place avoidance task and that it is possible to dissociate the effect of propranolol on the spatial performance and locomotion in the AAPA using dose-selection.",

Myasthenia gravis is the prototype for antagonistic autoimmune actions, where antibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) cause blockade of neuromuscular junctions. Antibodies and B-cells are increasingly recognised as major modulators of various cardiovascular and renal pathologies. We aim to critically review the notion that antibodies targeting other GPCRs may amplify or cause various cardiovascular and renal pathologies and summarise the current state of research, as well as perspectives in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

In these patients, an ARB reduces the risk of death from a cardiovascularcause or hospital admission for worsening heart failure. It is also recommended in patients with heart failure who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with an ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker. Treatment with an ARB improves ventricular function and patient well-being, and reduces hospital admission for worsening heart failure. In patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, although no treatment has yet been shown, convincingly, to reduce morbidity and mortality, adequate treatment of hypertension is important and ARB is considered to be able t o reduce the risk of admissionsfor heart failure.",

If the poles of the gas producing cell are connected by an electric circuit, the gas production starts. The rate of gas production can be regulated by a resistor in the electric circuit and by the duration of activation of the system. To get a remote control, we developed a small receiver which is located inside the capsule. The receiver consists of an oscillating circuit, which is in resonance with an external 24 MHz high frequency transmitter. A MOSFET transistor acts as a switch in the electric circuit to start the gas production. Release experiments with oxprenolol show that different release patterns can be obtained.",

    "195": "Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a naturally occurring compound isolated from honeybee propolis whose cardiovascular properties remain uncertain. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible mechanisms of CAPE-induced vasorelaxation in porcine coronary artery rings. It was found that both the quiescent and precontracted coronary artery ring segments were relaxed by CAPE (10(-7)-10(-)(4) M). N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine (L-NNA), methylene blue and removal of endothelium significantly attenuated CAPE-induced relaxation of both quiescent and precontracted artery rings. This relaxing effect of CAPE on coronary arteries was also significantly reduced by propranolol, and SQ22536, but not by indomethacin. In addition, the dose-response curves of KCl (2.5-100 mM) and CaCl(2) (10(-5)-10(-2) M) were displaced downwards in the presence of CAPE. These results suggest that the relaxant effect of CAPE on porcine coronary artery rings might involve the action of nitric oxide (NO) and adrenergic beta-receptor, together with their second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), respectively, but not involve the synthesis of prostaglandin.", 
    "196": "Heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is a common clinical problem with many unsolved questions regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy. Although the term diastolic heart failure has been abandoned, diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction together with combined systolic ventricular and arterial stiffening are considered to be the main pathophysiologic mechanisms in HFNEF. Current guidelines define HFNEF by symptoms or signs of heart failure in the presence of LV ejection fraction of more than 50%, but with additional evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. Definite diagnosis of HFNEF requires exclusion of valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, and several noncardiac diseases. Echocardiographic assessment of the tissue Doppler-derived filling index E/E', which is the ratio of the peak early mitral valve flow velocity to the peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity, should improve the noninvasive estimation of filling pressures in suspected HFNEF. Elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides may confirm HFNEF if tissue Doppler echocardiography is inconclusive. Treatment of HFNEF is symptom oriented and mainly based on pathophysiologic assumptions such as heart rate reduction, blood pressure control, and maintenance of sinus rhythm. In contrast to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, large-scale randomized controlled drug trials for HFNEF are scarce and could not demonstrate mortality reduction so far.",

IVO group had smaller left ventricular (LV) cavity and LV end-diastolic volume, and more increased interventricular septum thickness and higher basal septal thickness than non-IVO group. At rest, after Valsalva maneuver, during peak dose of dobutamine, and after NTG, IVPG was higher in IVO-group. To predict IVO during DSE, IVPG \u22655 mmHg after Valsalva maneuver had a sensitivity of 70.4% and specificity of 90.9%. and IVPG \u22654.5 mmHg after NTG had a sensitivity of 33.3% and specificity of 90.9%.",

    "205": "Sympathetic nerve failure has been proposed as a contributing factor in impaired cutaneous wound healing in diabetes mellitus. Nevertheless, no studies have shown whether beta-adrenoceptor blockade through beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol) administration may alter healing of diabetic cutaneous lesions. This study evaluated macro- and microscopically the effects of propranolol administration on cutaneous wound healing in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Acute diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin 14 days before wounding. Animals were treated with propranolol (50 mg/kg) dissolved in drinking water; controls received water only. Administration of beta-receptor antagonist began 1 day before wounding and was continued daily until euthanasia. A full-thickness excisional lesion (1 cm(2)) was created. The wound area was measured weekly and the animals were killed 14 days after wounding. Lesions and adjacent skin were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, Sirius red, and toluidine blue, and immunostained for CD-68, alpha-smooth muscle actin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The wound area was significantly smaller in the propranolol-treated group than in the control group 7 and 14 days after wounding. Inflammatory cell numbers and metalloproteinase-9 levels were reduced in the propranolol-treated group compared to the control group 14 days after wounding. Cell proliferation, mast cell number, collagen deposition, blood vessel density, and nitric oxide levels were increased in the propranolol-treated group compared to the control group 14 days after wounding. Propranolol administration improves cutaneous wound healing of hyperglycemic diabetic rats by reducing the local inflammatory response and improving subsequent phases of the repair process.", 
    "206": "Dishabituation is a return of a habituated response if context or contingency changes. In the mammalian olfactory system, metabotropic glutamate receptor mediated synaptic depression of cortical afferents underlies short-term habituation to odors. It was hypothesized that a known antagonistic interaction between these receptors and norepinephrine ss-receptors provides a mechanism for dishabituation. The results demonstrate that a 108 dB siren induces a two-fold increase in norepinephrine content in the piriform cortex. The same auditory stimulus induces dishabituation of odor-evoked heart rate orienting bradycardia responses in awake rats. Finally, blockade of piriform cortical norepinephrine ss-receptors with bilateral intracortical infusions of propranolol (100 microM) disrupts auditory-induced dishabituation of odor-evoked bradycardia responses. These results provide a cortical mechanism for a return of habituated sensory responses following a cross-modal alerting stimulus."
