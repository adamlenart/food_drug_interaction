    "0": "1 The distribution of the metabolites of noradrenaline, 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-diol (DOPEG) and 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-diol (MOPEG), in the brain of the mouse has been investigated.2 The rate of disappearance of the metabolites after inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase has been used to estimate their turnover rates in the mouse hypothalamus. It was concluded that the turnover of DOPEG was much faster than that of MOPEG.3 When mice were treated with reserpine dissolved in 5% ascorbic acid solution there was an increase in the hypothalamic concentration of both MOPEG and DOPEG. However, similar increases in the concentrations of the two metabolites were seen when the animals were treated with 5% ascorbic acid solution alone.4 The administration of tropolone, an inhibitor of the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase, resulted in an increase in the concentration of DOPEG.5 Mice, exposed to a temperature of -15 degrees C showed increased hypothalamic concentrations of both DOPEG and MOPEG.6 The rates of formation in the mouse striatum of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (HVA), acidic metabolites of dopamine, were compared with the turnover rate of dopamine, estimated from the rate at which this catecholamine disappears after treatment with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. It was concluded that the estimate of dopamine turnover obtained by this method is likely to be too large because of the compensatory feedback mechanism which is thought to play a role in the metabolism of dopamine in the brain.", 
    "1": "In a group of 14 hypertensive patients a 10-week course of treatment with prazosin 3-7.5 mg/day produced a significant reduction in mean blood pressure without serious side effects. The fall in diastolic pressure exceeded the response to a placebo by 10 mm Hg or more in 9 patients. The average decrease in diastolic pressure was similar to that produced by methyldopa 750 mg/day or propranolol 120-160 mg/day but the fall in systolic pressure was comparatively smaller, consistent with reported experimental work showing that the drug causes vasodilatation. The hypotensive effect of prazosin 1.5-3 mg/day combined with propranolol was significantly greater than that of propranolol alone and resulted in good control of blood pressure.", 
    "2": "1. The effects of nerve stimulation and of the topical application of noradrenaline on arteries, capillaries and veins of the mesentery of the anaesthetized rat were examined by direct observation under a microscope. The distribution of adrenergic nerves to the vessels of the mesentery was studied using the fluorescence histochemical method.2. Principal arteries, small arteries and terminal arterioles were all innervated by a network of adrenergic fibres and they all constricted in response to the stimulation of paravascular nerves and to exogenous noradrenaline. Few adrenergic fibres accompanied the smaller, precapillary arterioles; these vessels did not respond to nerve stimulation, although they were constricted by concentrations of noradrenaline as low as 10(-10) g/ml.3. The capillaries did not respond to nerve stimulation or to applied noradrenaline. All veins were constricted by noradrenaline, but only those veins greater than about 30 mum in internal diameter responded to nerve stimulation.4. At stimulus frequencies greater than 4 Hz the flow of blood through the microvasculature usually ceased, although there was never complete closure of these vessels. The maximum constriction observed in principal arteries was usually between 50 and 70% of the control internal diameter, and in small arteries and terminal arterioles was between 40 and 65% of the control internal diameter.5. It is concluded that the principal arteries and small arteries of the mesenteric vasculature are important in the control of blood flow through this vascular bed during sympathetic stimulation and following topical application of noradrenaline, and that the precapillary arterioles are important vessels determining the rate of blood flow through the capillary bed under resting conditions.", 
    "3": "The influence of various inhibitors on the cytolytic potential of mouse macrophages against syngeneic erythrocytes has been investigated in vitro by isotope techniques. Intact macrophage membrane and cell metabolism was essential for full cytotoxic activity. The process was completely blocked by anaerobiosis and cold. ATP from both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis seems to be the high energy intermediate which is utilized during the cytotoxic activity of macrophages leading to target cell lysis. The process did not depend on concomitant DNA transcription, translation, or protein synthesis.", 
    "4": "In order to characterize the influence of the adrenergic system on pancreatic glucagon secretion in man, changes in basal glucagon secretion during infusions of pure alpha and beta adrenergic agonists and their specific antagonists were studied. During infusion of isoproterenol (3 mug/min), a beta adrenergic agonist, plasma glucagon rose from a mean (+/-SE) basal level of 104+/-10 to 171+/-15 pg/ml, P < 0.0002. Concomitant infusion of propranolol (80 mug/min), a beta adrenergic antagonist, prevented the effects of isoproterenol, although propranolol itself had no effect on basal glucagon secretion. During infusion of methoxamine (0.5 mg/min), an alpha adrenergic agonist, plasma glucagon declined from a mean basal level of 122+/-15 to 75+/-17 pg/ml, P < 0.001. Infusion of phentolamine (0.5 mg/min), an alpha adrenergic antagonist, caused a rise in plasma glucagon from a mean basal level of 118+/-16 to 175+/-21 pg/ml, P < 0.0001. Concomitant infusion of methoxamine with phentolamine caused a reversal of the effects of phentolamine. The present studies thus confirm that catecholamines affect glucagon secretion in man and demonstrate that the pancreatic alpha cell possesses both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. Beta adrenergic stimulation augments basal glucagon secretion, while alpha adrenergic stimulation diminishes basal glucagon secretion. Furthermore, since infusion of phentolamine, an alpha adrenergic antagonist, resulted in an elevation of basal plasma glucagon levels, there appears to be an inhibitory alpha adrenergic tone governing basal glucagon secretion. The above findings suggest that catecholamines may influence glucose homeostasis in man through their effects on both pancreatic alpha and beta cell function.", 
    "5": "The effects of dobutamine ([+/-]-4-[2-[[3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1-methyl propyl] amino] ethyl] pyrocatechol hydrochloride), a new synthetic cardioactive sympathomimetic amine, were examined on direct and continuous measurements of left ventricular (LV) diameter (D), pressures (P), velocity of shortening (V), dP/dt, dP/dt/P, arterial pressure, cardiac output, and regional blood flows in the left circumflex coronary, mesenteric, renal, and iliac beds in healthy, conscious dogs. At the highest dose of dobutamine examined, 40 mug/kg/min, the drug increased dP/dt/P from 65+/-3 to 128+/-4 s(-1) and isolength velocity from 72+/-4 to 120+/-7 mm/s without affecting LV end diastolic D significantly. Mean arterial P rose from 92+/-2 to 104+/-3 mm Hg and heart rate from 78+/-3 to 111+/-7 beats/min, while LV end systolic D fell from 24.1+/-1.4 to 19.9+/-1.8 mm, reflecting a rise in stroke volume from 30+/-4 to 42+/-3 ml. Cardiac output rose from 2.41+/-0.23 to 4.35+/-0.28 liter/min, while calculated total peripheral resistance declined from 0.042+/-0.005 to 0.028+/-0.003 mm Hg/ml/min. The greatest increases in flow and decreases in calculated resistance occurred in the iliac and coronary beds, and the least occurred in the renal bed. Propranolol blocked the inotropic and beta(2) dilator responses while vasoconstricting effects mediated by alpha adrenergic stimulation remained in each of the beds studied. When dobutamine was infused after a combination of practolol and phentolamine, dilatation occurred in each of the beds studied. These observations indicate that dobutamine is a potent positive inotropic agent with relatively slight effects on preload, afterload, or heart rate, and thus may be a potentially useful clinical agent. The one property of this drug which is not ideal is its tendency to cause a redistribution of cardiac output favoring the muscular beds at the expense of the kidney and visceral beds."
