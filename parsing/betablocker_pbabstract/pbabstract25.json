    "0": "A greater understanding of the molecular basis of breast cancer metastasis will lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets and better treatments. Rap1B is a small GTPase that suppresses the metastasis of breast cancer cells by increasing cell-cell adhesion. In breast cancer, a decrease in Rap1B prenylation and subsequent loss of Rap1B at the plasma membrane decreases cell-cell adhesion and increases cell scattering, which promotes the metastatic phenotype. Protein kinase A (PKA) was recently found to phosphorylate Rap1B and inhibit its prenylation. PKA is activated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that stimulate G\u03b1s. In this study, we investigated whether the general G\u03b1s activator, cholera toxin, and agonists of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR), which is a G\u03b1s-coupled GPCR, promote Rap1B phosphorylation and inhibit its prenylation. We show here that cholera toxin and \u03b2AR activation phosphorylate Rap1B and inhibit its prenylation and membrane localization, reducing cell-cell adhesion and promoting cell scattering. Furthermore, we report that breast cancer cell migration is decreased by the FDA-approved \u03b2-blocker, propranolol. Pharmacological targeting of GPCRs, especially those such as the \u03b2AR that are regulated by FDA-approved drugs, to increase cell adhesion and decrease cell scattering could provide a promising therapeutic approach to reduce breast cancer metastasis.",

This review critically evaluates the latest literature that supports the myriad treatment options for infantile hemangiomas. It chronicles the fading role of steroid therapy and evolution of propranolol use as the major treatment modality. Although propranolol is helping this disease become more of a medical disease and less of a surgical dilemma, the report also reveals a continued search to find nonsystemic treatment options. In summary, this is an evidence-based medicine review for the treatment of infantile hemangiomas.",

This study presents the most used analytical methods for simultaneous determination in biological fluids of fixed combinations containing selective beta-blockers. Articles in Pub-Med, Science Direct and Wiley Journals databases published between years 2004-2014 were reviewed. Methods such as liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry--mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or high performance liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) were used for determination of fixed combination with beta-blockers in human plasma, rat plasma and human breast milk. LC-MS/MS method was used for simultaneous determination of fixed combinations of metoprolol with simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide or ramipril, combinations of nebivolol and valsartan, or atenolol and amlodipine. Biological samples were processed by protein precipitation techniques or by liquid-liquid extraction. For the determination of fixed dose combinations of felodipine and metoprolol in rat plasma liquid chromatography--electrospray ionization--mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was applied, using phenacetin as internal standard. HPLC-MS method was applied for the determination of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma.

It increased the duration to more than 10 minutes, i.e., by more than 20-fold (656.2 \u00b1 104.8 sec; P<0.001). In this model, a prior injection of a specific \u03b21-AR blocker metoprolol and an \u03b11-AR blocker prazosin both significantly attenuated NE-induced elongation of AF. To further explore the mechanisms underlying these receptors' effects on AF, we assessed the SR Ca(2+) leak, a major trigger of AF, and consequent spontaneous SR Ca(2+) release (SCR) in atrial myocytes. Consistent with the results of our in-vivo experiments, both metoprolol and prazosin significantly inhibited the NE-induced SR Ca(2+) leak and SCR. These findings suggest that both \u03b21-AR and \u03b11-AR may play important roles in the development of AF.",

A series of solubility and in vitro dissolution studies was carried out using media that simulate the gastric and intestinal fluids and cover the physiological pH range of the GI from 1.2 to 7.8. The effect of ionic strength, buffer capacity, and buffer species of the dissolution media on the solubility and dissolution behavior of carvedilol was also investigated. The study revealed that carvedilol exhibited a typical weak base pH-dependent solubility profile with a high solubility at low pH (545.1-2591.4 \u03bcg/mL within the pH range 1.2-5.0) and low solubility at high pH (5.8-51.9 \u03bcg/mL within the pH range 6.5-7.8). The dissolution behavior of carvedilol was consistent with the solubility results, where carvedilol release was complete (95.8-98.2% released within 60 min) in media simulating the gastric fluid (pH 1.2-5.0) and relatively low (15.9-86.2% released within 240 min) in media simulating the intestinal fluid (pH 6.5-7.8). It was found that the buffer species of the dissolution media may influence the solubility and consequently the percentage of carvedilol released by forming carvedilol salts of varying solubilities. Carvedilol solubility and dissolution decreased with increasing ionic strength, while lowering the buffer capacity resulted in a decrease in carvedilol solubility and dissolution rate.",

Risk factor modification, including weight loss and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea can reduce atrial fibrillation episodes. Appropriate anticoagulation is necessary for patients at substantial stroke risk regardless of rate or rhythm treatment strategy. Sinus rhythm is often needed to control symptoms; however, an alternative strategy for atrial fibrillation is appropriate rate control. Rate control is safe in older patients (those who are about age \u226565 years) followed up for a few years, but no such safety data exist for patients younger than 60 years or for those followed up for longer periods. Thus, selection of therapy is individualized, taking into account present and future medical problems for the patient. Choice of an antiarrhythmic drug is based on safety first vs efficacy. Catheter ablation is an effective nonpharmacological alternative that is often, but not always, the second-line treatment. Reduction of the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation episodes that result in a significant improvement in quality of life is a good marker of drug treatment success and complete elimination of atrial fibrillation is not required in many patients. Rate control is usually achieved with a \u03b2-blocker or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. It is important to assess adequate rate control during both rest and activity.

    "55": "In sinoatrial node (SAN) cells, electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange (NCX) is the dominant calcium (Ca) efflux mechanism. However, the role of NCX in the generation of SAN automaticity is controversial. To investigate the contribution of NCX to pacemaking in the SAN, we performed optical voltage mapping and high-speed 2D laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) of Ca dynamics in an ex vivo intact SAN/atrial tissue preparation from atrial-specific NCX knockout (KO) mice. These mice lack P waves on electrocardiograms, and isolated NCX KO SAN cells are quiescent. Voltage mapping revealed disorganized and arrhythmic depolarizations within the NCX KO SAN that failed to propagate into the atria. LSCM revealed intermittent bursts of Ca transients. Bursts were accompanied by rising diastolic Ca, culminating in long pauses dominated by Ca waves. The L-type Ca channel agonist BayK8644 reduced the rate of Ca transients and inhibited burst generation in the NCX KO SAN whereas the Ca buffer 1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA AM) did the opposite. These results suggest that cellular Ca accumulation hinders spontaneous depolarization in the NCX KO SAN, possibly by inhibiting L-type Ca currents. The funny current (If) blocker ivabradine also suppressed NCX KO SAN automaticity. We conclude that pacemaker activity is present in the NCX KO SAN, generated by a mechanism that depends upon If. However, the absence of NCX-mediated depolarization in combination with impaired Ca efflux results in intermittent bursts of pacemaker activity, reminiscent of human sinus node dysfunction and \"tachy-brady\" syndrome.", 
    "56": "The molecular events leading to nephrolithiasis are extremely complex. Previous studies demonstrated that calcium and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) may participate in the pathogenesis of stone formation, but the explicit mechanism has not been defined. Using a self-created genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming (GHS) rat model, we observed that the increased level of serous/uric TGF-\u03b21 and elevated intracellular calcium in primary renal tubular epithelial cells (PRECs) was associated with nephrolithiasis progression in vivo. In the setting of high calcium plus high TGF-\u03b21 in vitro, PRECs showed great potential epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression and osteochondral differentiation properties, representing the multifarious increased mesenchymal and osteochondral phenotypes (Zeb1, Snail1, Col2A1, OPN, Sox9, Runx2) and decreased epithelial phenotypes (E-cadherin, CK19) bythe detection of mRNAs and corresponding proteins. Moreover, TGF-\u03b2-dependent Wnt11 knockdown and L-type Ca2+ channel blocker could greatly reverse EMT progression and osteochondral differentiation in PRECs. TGF-\u03b21 alone could effectively promote EMT, but it had no effect on osteochondral differentiation in NRK cells (Rat kidney epithelial cell line). Stimulation with Ca2+ alone did not accelerate differentiation of NRK. Co-incubation of extracellular Ca2+ and TGF-\u03b21 synergistically promotes EMT and osteochondral differentiation in NRK control cells. Our data supplied a novel view that the pathogenesis of calcium stone development may be associated with synergic effects of TGF-\u03b21 and Ca2+, which promote EMT and osteochondral differentiation via Wnt11 and the L-type calcium channel.", 
    "57": "Memory processes may be involved in the transition from drug lapses to relapse. This study explored the role of noradrenaline (NA) in reacquisition of place preference, an animal model of relapse that involves the updating of memories about drugs and associated stimuli. Experiments involved 7 phases: habituation, conditioning (1\u00a0mg/kg heroin and vehicle; 4 pairings each), test of conditioning (Test I), extinction (vehicle and vehicle; 4 pairings each), test of extinction (Test II), reconditioning (1\u00a0mg/kg heroin and vehicle; 1 re-pairing each), and test of reconditioning (Test III). To target memory stabilization processes, various treatments were administered post-reconditioning: systemic clonidine (0, 10, 40, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg; \u03b12 adrenergic receptor agonist); intra-locus coeruleus (LC) clonidine (0, 4.5, 18\u00a0nmol); and intra-basolateral amygdala (BLA) propranolol/prazosin (0, 34/2.4\u00a0nmol; \u03b2 and \u03b11 adrenergic receptor antagonists, respectively). The effect of post-reconditioning systemic clonidine on BLA c-fos expression was also assessed. It was found that systemic clonidine dose-dependently blocked heroin reacquisition when given immediately or 4\u00a0h post-reconditioning, but not 8\u00a0h later or 4\u00a0h prior to Test III. Similar effects were observed following intra-LC clonidine infusions. Post-reconditioning systemic clonidine also blocked reacquisition of cocaine place preference (20\u00a0mg/kg). Finally, BLA c-fos expression was reduced by clonidine, and blockade of BLA \u03b2 and \u03b11 receptors prevented heroin reacquisition. These findings in rats support the hypothesis that relapse involves memory stabilization processes that can be disrupted by suppression of central NA activity.",

Univariate and multivariate unconditional logistic regressions were used to estimate the effects of glaucoma treatment and comorbidities on the risk of dry eye as indicated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Further analysis was performed to assess the dose-response effect on the risk of dry eye according to the cumulative number of different types of glaucoma medications used.",

    "62": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis of peritoneal mesothelial cells are known to be the earliest mechanisms of peritoneal fibrosis in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with an unfolded protein response is regarded to have a role in the development of organ fibrosis. To investigate the potential role of ER stress as a target to prevent and/or delay the development of peritoneal fibrosis, we examined the effect of ER stress on EMT or apoptosis of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and elucidated the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of ER stress preconditioning on TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT. ER stress inducers, tunicamycin (TM) and thapsigargin (TG), induced EMT with Smad2/3 phosphorylation, an increased nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin and Snail expression. Low concentrations of TM and TG did not induce apoptosis within 48\u2009h; however, high concentrations of TM- (>1\u2009ng/ml) and TG- (>1\u2009nM) induced apoptosis at 12\u2009h with a persistent increase in C/EBP homologous protein. TGF-\u03b21 induced EMT and apoptosis in HPMCs, which was ameliorated by taurine-conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid, an ER stress blocker. Interestingly, pre-treatment with TM or TG for 4\u2009h also protected the cells from TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT and apoptosis, demonstrating the role of ER stress as an adaptive response to protect HPMCs from EMT and apoptosis. Peritoneal mesothelial cells isolated from PD patients displayed an increase in GRP78/94, which was correlated with the degree of EMT. These findings suggest that the modulation of ER stress in HPMCs could serve as a novel approach to ameliorate peritoneal damage in PD patients.",

The rats were randomly divided into SAHA groups (low, medium and high dosage) and control group. The SAHA group rats were given 12.3, 24.5, and 49 mg/kg SAHA, respectively, by continuous intragastric administration for 7 days. The influence of SAHA on the activities of CYP450 isoforms CYP2B6, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 were evaluated by cocktail method, they were responsed by the changes of pharmacokinetic parameters of bupropion, phenacetin, tolbutamide, metroprolol and omeprazole. The five probe drugs were given to rats through intragastric administration, and the plasma concentration were determined by UPLC-MS/MS. The result of SAHA group compared to control group, there were statistical pharmacokinetics difference for bupropion, phenacetin, tolbutamide and metroprolol. Continuous intragastric administration for 7 days may induce the activities of CYP2C19 of rats, inhibit CYP1A2 and slightly inhibit CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 of rats. This may give advising for reasonable drug use after co-used with SAHA. The results indicated that drug co-administrated with SAHA may need dose adjustment.

The calcium overload in the axoplasm is considered to be crucial for secondary axonal injury. The present study use calcium channel blocker, nimodipine, to explore the influence of Ca2+ in the pathogenesis of rat DAI. In the DAI group, the expressions of \u03b2-APP and NF-L in axons were increased from 12 to 72 h. The ultrastructural observation indicated the axon and vessel injury appeared at 12 h post-injury and severely aggravated from 24 to 72 h. The expression of vWF and brain water content was increased at 12 h after injury and further increased at 24 h. Nimodipine decreased the expression of \u03b2-APP, NF-L and vWF, and also attenuated the ultrastructural damage of vascular wall and axons. Furthermore, Ca-dependent enzyme, the calcineurin activity were increased in DAI and nimodipine suppressed the activity of calcineurins (CaN). However, the amount of CaN expression was not changed. Our results showed that disturbances of axonal calcium homeostasis play an important role in the secondary damage of the axon, neuron and capillary vessel which may be related with activating CaN during the acute phase of DAI. Nimodipine can alleviate the secondary damage by suppressing the calcineurin activity.",

We investigated the underlying mechanism of the inhibition of \u03b21/2-ARs signaling for the treatment of CRC and elucidated the significance of \u03b22-AR expression in CRC in vitro and in clinical samples. The impacts of \u03b21/2-AR antagonists in CRC in vitro and CRC-xenograft in vivo were examined. We found that repression of \u03b22-AR but not \u03b21-AR signaling selectively suppressed cell viability, induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest, caused both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways-mediated apoptosis of specific CRC cells and inhibited CRC-xenograft growth in vivo. Moreover, the expression of \u03b22-AR was not consistent with the progression of CRC in vitro or in clinical samples. Our data evidence that the expression profiles, signaling, and blockage of \u03b22-AR have a unique pattern in CRC comparing to other cancers. \u03b22-AR antagonism selectively suppresses the growth of CRC accompanying active \u03b22-AR signaling, which potentially carries wild-type KRAS, in vitro and in vivo via the inhibition of \u03b22-AR transactivated EFGR-Akt/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Thus, \u03b22-AR blockage might be a potential therapeutic strategy for combating the progressions of \u03b22-AR-dependent CRC.",

The present study was aimed at investigating the role of \u03b2-adrenoceptor subtypes and catecholamine removal mechanisms in the adrenergic chronotropic response during the early post-natal period. Right atria isolated from immature (0-21 day old) and adult (4-6 month old) rats were used for determination of the responsiveness to agonists and quantitation of the transcripts of proteins involved in \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. The main results were: (a) the maximum response (Rmax) to norepinephrine increased with age, whereas sensitivity decreased; (b) age-dependent differences in sensitivity to norepinephrine were abolished by inhibition of the neuronal norepinephrine transporter; (c) Rmax to isoproterenol was similar in immature and adult atria, and depressed only in the former by \u03b22-adrenoceptor blockade with ICI118,551; (d) neonatal atria showed greater \u03b22-adrenoceptor mRNA levels, and more prominent positive chronotropic response to the \u03b22- and \u03b23-adrenoceptor agonists zinterol and YM178, respectively (nanomolar range); (e) in atria of immature rats, transcript levels of the extraneuronal monoamine transporter were lower, and its inhibition did not affect sensitivity to isoproterenol; and (f) reactivity to forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was not affected by age. The increased \u03b22- and \u03b23-adrenoceptor participation in the adrenergic chronotropic response, in addition to weaker catecholamine removal, may compensate for the immature cardiac innervation and the apparently reduced efficiency of \u03b21-adrenoceptor signaling in the neonate, increasing the responsiveness to endogenous and exogenous \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists.",

The case is described of a 58-year-old male patient who suffered a repetition of syncope due to HOCM, in whom septal myectomy was performed. As resection of the hypertrophied septum using Morrow's procedure was considered insufficient by palpation to release mitral regurgitation (MR) and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, the surgical approach was changed such that the right ventricular outflow tract and ventricular septum was incised. The residual hypertrophied septum was successfully resected to the base of the anterior papillary muscle under direct vision.

    "93": "Catamenial epilepsy is a common phenomenon in female epileptic patients that is, in part, influenced by the 17-\u03b2-estradiol level during the menstrual cycle, which modulates the strength of the epileptic seizures. However, the underlying mechanism(s) for catamenial epilepsy remains unknown. In the present study, the effect of 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol on modulating epileptiform activities was investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons by focusing on the transient outward potassium current. Using the patch clamp technique, 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol was demonstrated to have a dose\u2011dependent U\u2011shape effect on epileptiform bursting activities in cultured hippocampal neurons; only the low dose (~0.1 ng/ml) of 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol had a suppressive effect on the epileptiform activities. The blockade effect of the low dose 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol could be suppressed by phrixotoxin2 (PaTx2), a selective channel blocker for voltage\u2011gated potassium channel type 4.2 (Kv4.2), which mediates the transient outward potassium current. Furthermore, the 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol bell\u2011shape\u2011like dose\u2011dependently enhanced the transient outward potassium current, which was inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. In conclusion, these results indicate that reduced activation of the transient outward potassium current by a high (or none) 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol level may enhance the epileptiform bursting activities in neurons, which may be one of the triggering causes for catamenial epilepsy, and therefore, maintaining a certain low 17\u2011\u03b2\u2011estradiol level may aid in the control of catamenial epilepsy.",

In this study, a novel rat lung slice methodology has been developed and applied to study drug uptake in lung tissue, and the mechanisms by which this occurs. Freshly prepared lung slices (500 \u03bcm) from drug-naive rats were incubated with drugs followed by determination of the unbound drug volume of distribution in lung (Vu,lung), as the total concentration of drug in slices divided by the buffer (unbound) concentration. Vu,lung determined for a set of inhaled drug compounds ranged from 2.21 mL/g for salbutamol to 2970 mL/g for dibasic compound A. Co-incubation with monensin, a modulator of lysosomal pH, resulted in inhibition of tissue uptake of basic propranolol to 13%, indicating extensive lysosomal trapping. Partitioning into cells was particularly high for the cation MPP+ and the dibasic compound A, likely because of the carrier-mediated transport and lysosomal trapping. The results show that different factors are important for tissue uptake and the presented method can be used for profiling of inhaled compounds, leading to a greater understanding of distribution and exposure of drug in the lung.",

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the effects of carvedilol on diabetic nephropathy. At 20 weeks of age, male Spontaneous Diabetic Torii (SDT) rats were divided into three groups based on treatment: (i) an INS group (administered insulin); (ii) a CAR group (administered 10 mg/kg per day, p.o., carvedilol); and (iii) a diabetic (DM) group (administered vehicle). Rats were treated for a period of 10 weeks and were killed at 30 weeks of age. Urinary albumin excretion, renal histomorphology, and oxidative stress were evaluated. Urinary albumin excretion was significantly lower in the CAR than DM group (42.82 \u00b1 3.94 vs 76.62 \u00b1 13.74 mg/day respectively; P < 0.05). The mesangial index was lower in the CAR group than in the DM group. Urinary excretion of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), the number of 8-OHdG-positive cells in glomeruli, and the mRNA expression of NADPH oxidase p22(phox) and p47(phox) were also lower in the CAR than DM group.

As these patients are at particularly high risk, up to 16% in published studies, for postoperative cardiac complications, many proposals and algorithms for perioperative optimization have been suggested and studied in the literature. Moreover, in patients with recent coronary stents, the risk of non-cardiac surgery on adverse cardiac events is incremental in the first 6 months following stent implantation. Just as postoperative management of patients is vital to the outcome of a patient, preoperative assessment and optimization may reduce, and possibly completely alleviate, the risks of major postoperative complications, as well as assist in the decision-making process regarding the appropriate surgical and anesthetic management.

Alterations in myocardial energy substrate metabolism are a hallmark of heart failure, and are associated with an energy deficit in the failing heart. Previous studies have shown that a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to glycolysis, as well as an uncoupling between glycolysis and glucose oxidation, plays a crucial role in the development of cardiac inefficiency and functional impairment in heart failure. Therefore, optimizing energy substrate utilization, particularly by increasing mitochondrial glucose oxidation, can be a potentially promising approach to decrease the severity of heart failure by improving mechanical cardiac efficiency. One approach to stimulating myocardial glucose oxidation is to inhibit fatty acid oxidation. This review will overview the physiological regulation of both myocardial fatty acid and glucose oxidation in the heart, and will discuss what alterations in myocardial energy substrate metabolism occur in the failing heart. Furthermore, lysine acetylation has been recently identified as a novel post-translational pathway by which mitochondrial enzymes involved in all aspects of cardiac energy metabolism can be regulated. Thus, we will also discuss the effect of acetylation of metabolic enzymes on myocardial energy substrate preference in the settings of heart failure. Finally, we will focus on pharmacological interventions that target enzymes involved in fatty acid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, transcriptional regulation of fatty acid oxidation, and glucose oxidation to treat heart failure.",

Endoscopic banding ligation is also effective for the prevention of first bleeding, and it is the first choice in patients with contraindications or intolerance to \u03b2-blockers. Acute variceal hemorrhage still has a high mortality rate (around 15%) and requires intensive care management and conservative blood transfusion policy. Treatment is based on the combined use of vasoactive drugs, endoscopic band ligation and prophylactic antibiotics. Failures are best managed by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Balloon tamponade or specifically designed covered esophageal stents can be used as a bridge to definitive therapy in unstable patients. Early, preemptive TIPS might be the first choice in patients at high risk of failure (Child-Pugh B with active bleeding or Child-Pugh C up to 13 points). Patients surviving a variceal bleeding are at high risk of rebleeding. A combination of \u03b2-blockers and endoscopic band ligation is the most effective therapeutic approach.

Among all reffered patients to Feiz Hospital of Esfahan for cataract surgery, 122 patients between Mar to Sep 2010 were enrolled in this study and randomly allocated into one of the following equal groups: 40 mg propranolol, 2 hours before surgery and combination of 15 mg ketamine and 50 \u00b5g fentanyl l. 5 min before surgery. The ability to control of hemodynamic instabilities caused by stress and to gain patients satisfaction was compared between two groups. Also, the efficacy of each premedication to control of hemodynamic changes during surgery were evaluated and compared. No significant differences were seen in the patients satisfaction and controlling of stress induced hemodynamic changes between two groups (P>0.05). However, patients in ketamine + fentanyl group showed more nausea and less pain during and after surgery. Moreover, no significant adverse effects were reported during and after the surgery. Our results demonstrated that propranolol can be used safely as a premedication in cataract surgery in the comparable efficacy to ketamine plus fentanyl premedication.",

However, the detailed mechanisms by which carvedilol improves LV failure are incompletely understood. We previously showed that carvedilol is a \u03b2-arrestin-biased \u03b21-adrenergic receptor ligand, which activates cellular pathways in the heart independent of G protein-mediated second messenger signaling. More recently, we have demonstrated by microRNA (miR) microarray analysis that carvedilol upregulates a subset of mature and pre-mature miRs, but not their primary miR transcripts in mouse hearts. Here, we next sought to identify the effects of carvedilol on LV gene expression on a genome-wide basis. Adult mice were treated with carvedilol or vehicle for 1 wk. RNA was isolated from LV tissue and hybridized for microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling analysis revealed a small group of genes differentially expressed after carvedilol treatment. Further analysis categorized these genes into pathways involved in tight junction, malaria, viral myocarditis, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Genes encoding proteins in the tight junction, malaria, and viral myocarditis pathways were upregulated in the LV by carvedilol, while genes encoding proteins in the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy pathways were downregulated by carvedilol. These gene expression changes may reflect the molecular mechanisms that underlie the functional benefits of carvedilol therapy.",

Recently, human \u03b2-defensin 2 and fungal plectasin were shown to be immune-related potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily A member 3 (Kv1.3) channel inhibitors. This work continued to show that the human \u03b1-defensins human neutrophil peptide (HNP) 1 and human defensin (HD) 5 are selective Kv1.3 channel inhibitors with 50% inhibition concentration values of 102.0 \u00b1 30.3 nM and 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively. Furthermore, HNP1 was found to inhibit Kv1.3 currents and IL-2 secretion in human CD3(+) T cells. Despite the structural similarity between HNP1 and HD5, HNP1 could simultaneously bind to the S1-S2 linker and the pore region of the Kv1.3 channel as both a toxinlike blocker and a novel modifier, whereas HD5 could only bind to the channel pore region as a toxinlike blocker. As a channel modifier, HNP1 could shift the conductance-voltage relationship curve of the Kv1.3 channel by \u223c9.5 mV in the positive direction and could increase the time constant for channel activation through the electrostatic repulsion between the cationic HNP1 anchored in the S1-S2 linker and the positively charged S4 domain of the Kv1.3 channel. Together, these findings reveal that human \u03b1-defensins are novel endogenous inhibitors of Kv1.3 channels with distinct interaction mechanisms, which facilitates future research into their adaptive immune functions.",

Therefore, inhibition of fatty acids-induced \u03b2-cell dysfunction and apoptosis might provide benefit for the therapy of type 2 diabetes. The present study examined whether regulation of fatty acids-triggered calcium influx could protect pancreatic \u03b2-cells from lipotoxicity. Two small molecule compounds, L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine and potassium channel activator diazoxide were used to inhibit palmitic acid-induced calcium influx. And whether the compounds could reduce palmitic acid-induced \u03b2-cell failure and the underlying mechanism were also investigated. It was found that both nifedipine and diazoxide protected MIN6 pancreatic \u03b2-cells and primary cultured murine islets from palmitic acid-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the impaired insulin secretion was also recovered to varying degrees by these two compounds. Our results verified that nifedipine and diazoxide could reduce palmitic acid-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress to generate protective effects on pancreatic \u03b2-cells.

However, the probable role of this drug in aluminum chloride (AlCl3)-induced experimental dementia is yet to be explored. Therefore, the present study is designed to investigate the effect of AlCl3-induced dementia in mice. Morris water maze test and elevated plus maze were utilized to evaluate learning and memory. Various biochemical estimations including brain acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), brain total protein, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) level, reduced glutathione (GSH) level, nitrate/nitrite, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. AlCl3 significantly impaired learning and memory and increased brain AChE, brain total protein, TBARS, and nitrate/nitrite and decreased brain GSH or SOD. On the other hand, treatment with diltiazem significantly reversed AlCl3-induced behavioral and biochemical deficits.

Our foremost objective was to optimize the components Eudragit(\u00ae) RS PO, polyethylene oxide (PEO) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) to balance both buoyancy and controlled release. Gas generated by sodium bicarbonate in acidic medium was trapped in the polymer matrix to enable floating. Eudragit(\u00ae) RS PO and PEO with sodium bicarbonate resulted in multiparticulates which exhibited rapid flotation within 3 min but inadequate total floating time (TFT) of 3h. Addition of HPMC to the matrix did not affect floating lag time (FLT), moreover TFT increased to more than 12h with controlled release of metoprolol succinate. Floating multiparticulates exhibited t50% of 5.24h and t90% of 10.12h. XRD and DSC analysis revealed crystalline state of drug while FTIR suggested nonexistence of chemical interaction between the drug and the other excipients. The assay, FLT, TFT and the drug release of the multiparticulates were unchanged when stored at 40\u00b0C/75%RH for 3 months confirming stability.

Our study was aimed at evaluating the effects, and the underlying mechanisms, of metformin on hepatic and systemic hemodynamics in cirrhotic rats and its possible interaction with the effects of propranolol (Prop), the current standard treatment for portal hypertension. CCl4-cirrhotic rats received by gavage metformin 300 mg/kg or its vehicle once a day for 1 wk, before mean arterial pressure (MAP), portal pressure (PP), portal blood flow (PBF), hepatic vascular resistance, and putative molecular/cellular mechanisms were measured. In a subgroup of cirrhotic rats, the hemodynamic response to acute Prop (5 mg/kg iv) was assessed. Effects of metformin \u00b1 Prop on PP and MAP were validated in common bile duct ligated-cirrhotic rats. Metformin-treated CCl4-cirrhotic rats had lower PP and hepatic vascular resistance than vehicle-treated rats, without significant changes in MAP or PBF. Metformin caused a significant reduction in liver fibrosis (Sirius red), hepatic stellate cell activation (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 polypeptide, transforming growth factor-\u03b2R1, and Rho kinase), hepatic inflammation (CD68 and CD163), superoxide (dihydroethidium staining), and nitric oxide scavenging (protein nitrotyrosination). Prop, by decreasing PBF, further reduced PP. Similar findings were observed in common bile duct ligated-cirrhotic rats. Metformin administration reduces PP by decreasing the structural and functional components of the elevated hepatic resistance of cirrhosis. This effect is additive to that of Prop. The potential impact of this pharmacological combination, otherwise commonly used in patients with cirrhosis and diabetes, needs clinical evaluation.",

However, we are not convinced that these four indicators will provide sufficient information on the quality of care in our hospitals. Hence, we performed a retrospective analysis on a larger set of parameters and evaluated their applicability as indicators of quality of care.", 
    "202": "We measured 38 indicators in 153 patients (69 transferred and 84 on-site) with a STEMI who presented at, or were transferred to the UZ Brussels in 2013 and received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", 
    "203": "The unadjusted overall mortality was 7.2% (n = 11/153). Important differences in unadjusted mortality were observed between the on-site and transferred patients (10.7%, n = 9 vs 2.9%, n = 2, P = 0.112), which were attributed to the initial condition at presentation and a larger proportion of cardiogenic shocks in the on-site group. Discharge medication highly corresponded with the ESC guidelines.", 
    "204": "We demonstrate that the proposed quality indicators do not provide sufficient information to compare hospitals and that it is of utmost importance to weigh the mortality according to risk profile.", 
    "205": "Use of opioids to provide adequate perioperative analgesia often leads to respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, pruritus, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, with the potential to increase length of stay in the hospital. In an effort to reduce perioperative opioid administration yet provide appropriate pain relief, researchers began to study the use of esmolol beyond its well-known cardiovascular effects. Perioperative esmolol has been shown to reduce anesthetic requirements, decrease perioperative opioid use, decrease the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, lead to an earlier discharge, and increase patient satisfaction. This article provides a review of the literature on the use of esmolol as an adjunct for perioperative analgesia and anesthesia.", 
    "206": "Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is involved in sensory nerve nociceptive signaling. Recently, it has been discovered that TRPV1 receptors also regulate basal body temperature in multiple species from mice to humans. In the present study, we investigated whether TRPV1 modulates basal sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. C57BL6/J wild-type (WT) mice and TRPV1 knockout (KO) mice were implanted with radiotelemetry probes for measurement of core body temperature. AMG9810 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (2% DMSO/5% Tween 80/10 ml/kg saline) was injected intraperitoneally. Adrenoceptor antagonists or vehicle (5 ml/kg saline) was injected subcutaneously. In WT mice, the TRPV1 antagonist, AMG9810, caused significant hyperthermia, associated with increased noradrenaline concentrations in brown adipose tissue. The hyperthermia was significantly attenuated by the \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, the mixed \u03b1-/\u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist labetalol, and the \u03b11-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. TRPV1 KO mice have a normal basal body temperature, indicative of developmental compensation. d-Amphetamine (potent sympathomimetic) caused hyperthermia in WT mice, which was reduced in TRPV1 KO mice, suggesting a decreased sympathetic drive in KOs. This study provides new evidence that TRPV1 controls thermoregulation upstream of the SNS, providing a potential therapeutic target for sympathetic hyperactivity thermoregulatory disorders.", 
    "207": "We investigated the protective effects of mannitol on corneal damage caused by benzalkonium chloride (BAC), which is used as a preservative in commercially available timolol maleate eye drops, using rat debrided corneal epithelium and a human cornea epithelial cell line (HCE-T). Corneal wounds were monitored using a fundus camera TRC-50X equipped with a digital camera; eye drops were instilled into rat eyes five times a day after corneal epithelial abrasion. The viability of HCE-T cells was calculated by TetraColor One; and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739) were used to measure antimicrobial activity. The reducing effects on transcorneal penetration and intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye drops were determined using rabbits. The corneal wound healing rate and rate constant (kH), as well as cell viability, were higher following treatment with 0.005% BAC solution containing 0.5% mannitol than in the case BAC solution alone; the antimicrobial activity was approximately the same for BAC solutions with and without mannitol. In addition, the kH for rat eyes instilled with commercially available timolol maleate eye drops containing 0.5% mannitol was significantly higher than that for eyes instilled with timolol maleate eye drops without mannitol, and the addition of mannitol did not affect the corneal penetration or IOP reducing effect of the timolol maleate eye drops. A preservative system comprising BAC and mannitol may provide effective therapy for glaucoma patients requiring long-term treatment with anti-glaucoma agents.", 
    "208": "Chronic heart failure is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide with increasing prevalence and incidence. Due to the high morbidity and mortality a standardized and evidence-based therapy is crucial. The present review article gives an overview about the innovations in 2014 based on the current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. First, improvements in established medication regimens regarding beta blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as well as treatment options for heart rate reduction will be explained. Second, new pharmacological developments, such as angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibition will be discussed. Finally, new insights into common comorbidities of patients with chronic heart failure, such as atrial fibrillation and hyperkalemia will be presented.", 
    "209": "There are few prospective data available for establishing a standard diuretic administration regimen for patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of three regimens of furosemide administration in patients with ADHF with regard to diuresis, renal functions, and in-hospital outcomes.", 
    "210": "A total of 43 patients who presented with ADHF were randomized into three groups: (a) continuous infusion (cIV) of 160\u00a0mg furosemide for 16\u00a0h/day (n\u2009=\u200915); (b) bolus injections (bI) of 80\u00a0mg furosemide twice a day (n\u2009=\u200914); (c) and administration of 160\u00a0mg furosemide plus hypertonic saline solution (HSS) as an infusion for 30\u00a0min once a day (n\u2009=\u200914). All regimens were continued for 48\u00a0h. Study endpoints were negative fluid balance assessed by loss of body weight, change in the serum creatinine (baseline to 48\u00a0h and baseline to compensated state), and length of hospitalization.", 
    "211": "There was no significant difference in the mean change in serum creatinine level at the end of 48\u00a0h between groups (p\u2009=\u20090.08). There was also no significant difference among groups regarding loss of body weight (p\u2009=\u20090.66). A significantly shorter hospitalization was observed in patients treated with HSS compared with the other groups (cIV group 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.4\u00a0days vs. bI group 7.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1\u00a0days vs. HSS group 3.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u00a0days; p\u2009<\u20090.01).", 
    "212": "All three furosemide regimens have similar renal safety and efficacy measures. However, administration of furosemide plus HSS may be the preferred diuretic strategy because of its shorter hospital stay.", 
    "213": "There is wide consensus about the benefits of beta-blockers in systolic heart failure. However, it is not clear if one specific beta-blocker is superior to the others. Some guidelines favor three \u0093evidence-based\u0094 beta-blockers (carvedilol, bisoprolol and metoprolol) that have proved to decrease mortality. Carvedilol might have different physiological properties, commonly referred as pleiotropic effects, but the clinical meaning of them is not clear. Searching in Epistemonikos database, which is maintained by screening 30 databases, we identified four systematic reviews including eight pertinent randomized controlled trials. We combined the evidence using meta-analysis and generated a summary of findings following the GRADE approach. We concluded there is little or no difference in hospitalization risk between carvedilol and bisoprolol or metoprolol, but carvedilol might decrease mortality compared to metoprolol or bisoprolol. It is uncertain whether nebivolol can be an alternative because the certainty of the evidence is very low.", 
    "214": "Es indiscutido el beneficio de los betabloqueadores para pacientes con insuficiencia cardiaca con disfunci\u00f3n sist\u00f3lica, sin embargo, no existe claridad sobre cu\u00e1l de ellos es superior. Algunas gu\u00edas cl\u00ednicas han favorecido a tres de ellos (carvedilol, bisoprolol y metoprolol) por su probado beneficio en disminuci\u00f3n de mortalidad. Carvedilol podr\u00eda tener diversos efectos fisiol\u00f3gicos, normalmente llamados efectos pleiotr\u00f3picos, pero el real significado cl\u00ednico de estos no est\u00e1 claro. Utilizando la base de datos Epistemonikos, la cual es mantenida mediante b\u00fasquedas en 30 bases de datos, identificamos cuatro revisiones sistem\u00e1ticas que en conjunto incluyen ocho estudios aleatorizados pertinentes. Realizamos un metan\u00e1lisis y tablas de resumen de los resultados utilizando el m\u00e9todo GRADE. Se concluye que existir\u00eda poca o nula diferencia entre los distintos betabloqueadores en cuanto a hospitalizaciones por cualquier causa, pero que carvedilol podr\u00eda disminuir la mortalidad comparado con metoprolol o bisoprolol. Existe incertidumbre sobre si nebivolol podr\u00eda ser una alternativa porque la certeza de la evidencia es muy baja.", 
    "215": "Beta-adrenoreceptor blockers are essential in controlling the peripheral actions of thyroid hormones and a rapid heart rate in patients with thyroid storm, although they should be used with great caution when there is the potential for heart failure. A 67-year-old woman was diagnosed as having thyroid storm in addition to marked tachycardia with atrial fibrillation and heart failure associated with a reduced left ventricular function. The administration of an oral beta blocker, bisoprolol fumarate, induced hypotension and was not tolerable for the patient, whereas landiolol hydrochloride, a short-acting intravenous beta-adrenoreceptor blocker with high cardioselectivity and a short elimination half-life, was useful for controlling the patient's tachycardia and heart failure without causing hemodynamic deterioration."
