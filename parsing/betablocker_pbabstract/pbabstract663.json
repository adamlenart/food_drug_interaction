    "0": "A simple model to characterize sympathetic and parasympathetic effects on heart rate (R) was tested during rest in 10 nonathletes and 8 world-class oarsmen. The model states that R = mnR0, where R0 is the intrinsic cardiac rate, and m and n depend only on sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, respectively. The multipliers, m and n, were determined by dual pharmacological blockade in two sessions under similar conditions, but in one session propranolol and in the other atropine was given first. In agreement with the model, when corrections were made for atropine-induced blood pressure changes, m and n did not depend on which blocking agent was administered first. In athletes the control heart rate [55 +/- 3.3 (SD) beats/min] and R0 (81 +/- 8.3 beats/min) were lower than in nonathletes (62 +/- 6.0, P less than 0.01 and 102 +/- 11, P less than 0.001, respectively). The sympathetic multiplier, m, was similar (1.18 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.20 +/- 0.05, P greater than 0.4) in the two groups, but n, the parasympathetic multiplier, was closer to 1 in the athletes (0.57 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.05, P less than 0.01). We conclude that the model is suitable for the quantitative study of sympathetic/parasympathetic heart rate control in humans, and that the lower resting heart rate in oarsmen is solely due to a reduction in intrinsic cardiac rate, and not to an increase in parasympathetic tone.", 
    "1": "Two patients with classical effort-induced angina pectoris associated with abnormal ST-segment depression on graded exercise testing and normal coronary arteriograms are described. Both patients deteriorated during treatment with propranolol, and became asymptomatic during treatment with verapamil with normal graded exercise tests. Verapamil may thus improve an inadequate vasodilatatory response of the coronary vascular bed to effort.", 
    "2": "We have previously reported that labetalol infusion increases prolactin (PRL) secretion in hypertensive patients. In an attempt to investigate the site where labetalol stimulates PRL, the drug was infused intravenously (100 mg) into healthy subjects, both under basal conditions and after pretreatment with L-dopa plus carbidopa (250 mg and 25 mg respectively every 6 h for 1 day), since this regimen has been reported to blunt the PRL responses to centrally acting stimuli. The effects of oral labetalol administration (100 and 200 mg) on PRL was also evaluated. Serum PRL concentration did not change after oral labetalol, whereas it was increased by intravenous drug administration. This effect was completely abolished by pretreatment with L-dopa plus carbidopa. These findings, though they do not demonstrate the mechanism, suggest that the hyperprolactinaemia induced by labetalol is mediated inside the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "3": "The binding of the spin-labeled propranolol and spin-labeled progesterone to human orosomucoid has been studied as a function of temperature by electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques. At 20 degrees C the association constants are 1.9 x 10(6) and 4.9 x 10(5) M-1, respectively. In each case, the binding is competitive with unlabeled ligand. Above about 50 degrees C the apparent association constant for both ligands decreases rapidly with increasing temperature. This is due to thermal denaturation of the orosomucoid, as was shown independently by ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Below the denaturation region the number of binding sites per orosomucoid molecule remains constant at approx. 1. Examination of the thermodynamic parameters shows the progesterone binding at 37 degrees C to be essentially enthalpically driven, while the propranolol binding at 37 degrees C has a substantial entropic component.", 
    "4": "Following oral dosing to steady state, the disposition of S(-)- and R(+)-propranolol and their corresponding glucuronide conjugates was studied in 4 healthy adults using doses from 40 to 320 mg/day of the racemate. Steady -state plasma concentrations of S(-)-propranolol and its corresponding glucuronide conjugate were greater than that for R(+)-propranolol and its corresponding conjugate. The average steady-state concentration of both enantiomers increased disproportionately to dose. There was a 52+/- 7 (mean +/- SD) % decrease in the intrinsic clearance (clint) of S(-)-propranolol and a 65 +/- 22% decrease in the Clint of R(+)-propranolol over the dosing range studied. The terminal elimination half-lives of S(-)-propranolol and its glucuronide conjugate were longer than for the R(+)-enantiomer at all doses. The formation of glucuzonide conjugates of S(-)- and R(+)-propranolol was best described by a saturable process in all subjects. Within individuals, the ratio of Vmax/Km for the glucuronide conjugate of S(-)-propranolol was from 2.1-to 4.9-fold greater than for the conjugate of the R(+)-enantiomer. These studies demonstrate for the first time, that propranolol undergoes stereoselective disposition in humans.", 
    "5": "1 The antihypertensive effect of prazosin has been studied in three groups of hypertensive patients. 2 The drug caused a significant reduction of blood pressure both as monotherapy and combined with alprenolol. 3 The effect of prazosin on blood pressure was more marked at the first dose and especially in combination with alprenolol. 4 No pharmacokinetic interaction between prazosin and alprenolol was observed. 5 Prazosin exhibits an exaggerated first dose effect together with alprenolol. Smaller starting doses of prazosin in combination therapy with beta-adrenoceptor blockers are warranted.", 
    "6": "1 The effects of three day courses of propranolol 40 mg three times daily, atenolol 100 mg twice daily and labetalol 100 mg three times daily on antipyrine kinetics were examined in 13 normal subjects. 2 The mean antipyrine clearance initially was 41.3 +/- 12.4 ml/min (mean +/- s.d.) and fell to 35.0 +/- 12.1 ml/min following propranolol (P less than 0.025), 34.5 +/- 9.5 ml/min following atenolol (P less than 0.01), and 35.2 +/- 8.6 ml/min following labetalol (P less than 0.05). 3 The prolongation in antipyrine half-life was significant only following atenolol. Propranolol only caused a significant reduction in the volume of distribution of antipyrine. 4 These adrenoceptor antagonists appear to decrease antipyrine clearance in normal subjects. The reduction in antipyrine clearance was similar with all three drugs and appeared to be independent of the differing lipid solubilities and pharmacological profiles of the adrenoceptor antagonists examined.", 
    "7": "1 Labetalol was administered by intravenous infusion or by the combination of intravenous bolus injection plus infusion to 15 patients with severe essential hypertension and to one with phaeochromocytoma. 2 With the infusion alone the reduction of arterial pressure was slow to develop and limited in degree, but with the combination of the bolus injection plus the infusion the reduction in pressure was more prompt, more pronounced and longer lasting. Apart from an uncomplicated syncopal attack in one patient, no serious side--effects were encountered. 3 Subsequent treatment with oral labetalol usually required the addition of a diuretic to control the blood pressure probably due to sodium and fluid retention during treatment with labetalol alone.", 
    "8": "1 We have compared, in patients with severe hypertension, the administration of intravenous labetalol by single rapid injection, by repeated bolus injections, and by incremental infusion. 2 Incremental infusion was the most consistently (albeit not invariably) effective method, and that least prone to cause side-effects. 3 An occasional very marked decrease in blood pressure was seen with all these techniques but least often with incremental infusion. Thus close and continuous supervision is mandatory. 4 All three methods produced slight but significant decreases in heart rate, and in plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone. 5 Intravenous labetalol was also effective in controlling hypertensive crises of phaeochromocytoma and those following the withdrawal of clonidine. 6 In a total of 70 severely hypertensive patients given intravenous labetalol, none showed adverse neurological or cardiological sequelae.", 
    "9": "1 Labetalol 100 mg was given intravenously to 27 patients with essential hypertension (12 males, 15 females; WHO I-II; age range 30-66 yr; on average, a significant reduction of blood pressure was observed within 5 min (P less than 0.001). Average heart rate was also reduced significantly (P less than 0.01). 2 In 18 patients haemodynamic measurements were performed (dye-dilution or thermodilution technique): blood pressure reduction was related to peripheral vasodilatation, as cardiac index remained unmodified. 3 The absolute and percentage decrease of blood pressure, heart rate and total peripheral resistance after labetalol 100 mg intravenously, was significantly greater in the patients with higher baseline plasma noradrenaline concentration values. 4 In 12 out of 27 patients labetalol was given orally for 2 months (dose range 300-1200 mg); the pattern of blood pressure and heart rate changes after oral therapy were comparable to those observed after acute administration of the drug. 5 The degree of blood pressure and heart rate reductions after oral labetalol was also significantly related to pretreatment basal noradrenaline concentration.", 
    "10": "1 The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered labetalol were studied in four patients with severe renal failure and in three normal subjects. 2 A new and sensitive method for the assay of plasma labetalol concentrations using high performance liquid chromatography is described. 3 Labetalol has a relatively large apparent volume of distribution (3.3-7.9 l/kg, two-compartment open model) and a relatively high plasma clearance (0.3-1.6 1 h-1 kg-1). 4 There were no significant differences between the patients with severe renal failure and the controls for any of the pharmacokinetic parameters measured. 5 In the presence of renal functional impairment, no modification of labetalol dosage is required. 6 In another study of 31 patients, glomerular filtration rate was measured at 3-month intervals for 3-18 months. In ten patients there was no change, in ten there was an improvement and in 11 there was deterioration, but in only three was this attributable to treatment. 7 In our experience with over 300 patients, we conclude that labetalol plus diuretic treatment is efficacious and safe in all grades of hypertension including those with all degrees of renal insufficiency.", 
    "11": "1 During chronic treatment of hypertensive patients observed mean steady-state plasma labetalol levels in ten patients were consistently and significantly higher than predicted from initial acute pharmacokinetic analysis. 2 Mean steady-state levels varied from 36 to 183 ng/ml on a chronic dose of 200 mg twice daily. 3 Patients with lower steady-state levels on a fixed dose of labetalol usually required higher maintenance doses to control blood pressure.", 
    "12": "1 The results of the treatment of 8573 hypertensive patients with labetalol in general practice, for periods between 1 month and 5 yr, are reviewed. 2 The data reviewed were obtained from the published literature together with our own published (Kane et al., 1976; Kane et al., 1979) and more recent (unpublished) work. 3 Between 60% and 80% of severe (diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg) and previously uncontrolled hypertensives responded satisfactorily to the drug, as did up to 88% of mild to moderate hypertensives. 4 The anti-hypertensive effect of labetalol was not dependent on the frequency of administration, twice and three times daily treatment regimes being equally effective. 5 The withdrawal rate attributable to side-effects was between 6% and 13%. Tiredness, dizziness, headache and upper gastro-intestinal symptoms were the four principal side-effects, but they were usually transient when labetalol treatment was continued. 6 No drug interactions or adverse haematological or biochemical changes were seen.", 
    "13": "1 The anti-hypertensive effect of labetalol given twice or three times daily was evaluated in ambulant subjects with essential hypertension by recording blood pressure directly for 24 h before and after 15 d of labetalol administration (daily dose 600-1800 mg). 2 Labetalol reduced 24 h systolic and diastolic blood pressures by about 20%. The reduction was evident throughout the whole 24 h period, although it was less marked during sleep. The hypotensive effect was similar when the drug was given twice or three times daily. 3 The 24 h heart rate was reduced during labetalol treatment. However, this effect was less marked than the hypotensive effect and was not present in all subjects. 4 There was a reduction in the standard deviations of blood pressure and heart rate values. However, in neither case was the coefficient of variation altered, indicating that labetalol did not have any significant effect on the shape of the 24 h blood pressure measurements.", 
    "14": "1 Labetalol at a dose of 800 to 1600 mg daily inhibited isoprenaline-induced tachycardia and phenylephrine-induced elevation in arterial pressure in hypertensive subjects. The beta-adrenoreceptor effect was four times more potent than the alpha-adrenoreceptor effect. 2 Isoprenaline-induced tachycardia was more effectively blocked than isoprenaline-induced inotropism, thereby raising the possibility of a subselective effect on cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. 3 Labetalol reduced blood pressure in hypertensive subjects with no change in cardiac output in the supine or upright position and with marked inhibition of the heart rate and blood pressure response to treadmill exercise. 4 Labetalol administered in single doses to patients with stable, treated congestive heart failure impaired blood pressure support during exercise. 5 The unique adrenoceptor and haemodynamic effects of labetalol make it a potentially attractive drug for management of hypertension and other cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "15": "1 Observed and possible roles for the use of labetalol in anaesthesia are reviewed. 2 When used together with halothane inhalation anaesthesia, satisfactory conditions are achieved for safe hypotensive anaesthesia: (a) Labetalol and halothane have additive hypotensive effects. (b) The usual dose of labetalol is 25 mg intravenously together with 1% halothane. (c) The duration of hypotension can be controlled in the presence of halothane; withdrawal leads to rapid recovery of pre-surgery blood pressure. (d) High doses of halothane (3%) with labetalol predispose to the myocardial depressant effects of halothane and undesirable reductions in myocardial performance. 3 As it is now seen to be important to reduce the blood pressure before anaesthesia and surgery in hypertensive patients, then labetalol is likely to be satisfactory either by the intravenous route for immediate reduction or for less urgent reduction of raised arterial pressure by the oral route. 4 It is known that anaesthesia (for example, laryngoscopy) and surgery provoke hypertensive responses which are particularly undesirable in the patient with pre-existent myocardial ischaemia. In such cases it is likely that previous treatment with labetalol will satisfactorily modify unwanted hypertensive and cardiovascular responses.", 
    "16": "1 Eighty-five women with severe hypertension complicating pregnancy were treated with oral labetalol (Trandate). Six of these had a twin pregnancy and 54 had proteinuria. 2 Effective control of the blood pressure was achieved in all but six patients. The maximum dose of labetalol prescribed was 1200 mg daily. There were no significant maternal or foetal side-effects. 3 Foeto-placental function was carefully monitored in all patients. Twenty-four of the 89 infants born alive showed evidence of intra-uterine growth retardation, the highest incidence occurring in the group of patients with essential hypertension complicated by pregnancy induced hypertension. 4 The low perinatal mortality of 4.4% was a reflection of the meticulous control of the blood pressure. 5 There were no congenital malformations or evidence of oculotoxicity in any of the infants delivered. 6 The efficient hypotensive action of orally administered labetalol together with the absence of maternal and foetal side effects and consequent improved perinatal mortality confirms that it is an eminently suitable drug for the treatment of hypertension complicating pregnancy.", 
    "17": "1 Effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured in two groups of 12 patients both at rest and during sub-maximal cycloergometer exercise while on placebo and after 3 months of treatment with either labetalol or propranolol. 2 ERPF increased and renal vascular resistance decreased both at rest and during exercise after labetalol treatment, compared with placebo; the opposite was observed after propranolol treatment. 3 GFR increased after labetalol and decreased after propranolol both at rest and during exercise, compared with placebo, but these changes were not statistically significant. 4 Labetalol and propranolol resulted in the same decrease in blood pressure and a comparable incidence of side effects.", 
    "18": "1 Patients with combined hypertension and angina pectoris may represent a therapeutic dilemma, with the angina being refractory to conventional beta-blockade. 2 The added benefit of peripheral vasodilation in control of blood pressure is documented in the case of nifedipine. 3 Improved blood pressure control by added nifedipine may not be accompanied by decreased severity of angina pectoris, emphasizing the complex causation of the angina in such patients. 4 The clinically proven added alpha-blocking activity of labetalol distinguishes labetalol from other beta-blockers. However, the suggested benefits of the added alpha-activity in patients with hypertension and angina remain to be proven by further trials in patients.", 
    "19": "1 The role of labetalol in managing acute myocardial infarction is reviewed. 2 After intravenous infusion labetalol lowers blood pressure in patients with increased blood pressure associated with acute myocardial infarction. 3 Although average heart rate was decreased, cardiac index fell only slightly and stroke index was substantially unchanged. 4 In patients whose pretreatment pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressures were increased, labetalol induced decreases, whereas in the presence of normal pressures, these were unchanged. 5 It is concluded that labetalol infusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction is unlikely to precipitate heart failure and is likely to be of value in reducing myocardial oxygen requirement.", 
    "20": "1 The effect of labetalol 100 mg orally twice daily on exercise tolerance has been compared with placebo in 19 normotensive subjects with angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease. 2 Labetalol, at the same work load as during placebo exercise, significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as well as heart rate and rate-pressure product. 3 Similarly, ST segment depression was reduced by labetalol from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 1.36 +/- 0.6 mm (P less than 0.001), thus enabling an increase in exercise tolerance from a control value of 83.7 +/- 18 to 95.3 +/- 19 W (P less than 0.005). 4 In seven other patients, also with coronary artery disease, the haemodynamic effects of a single 0.6 mg/kg intravenous dose of the drug was evaluated during exercise. 5 Compared with conditions during control exercise, labetalol induced a significant reduction in rate-pressure product from 17228 +/- 2375 to 13445 +/- 2404 mmHg/min (P less than 0.005) and in peripheral vascular resistance from 612.0 +/- 61.2 to 512.7 +/- 36.2 dyn cm-5 m-2 (P less than 0.0025). These events were not accompanied by any change in cardiac index and in dP/dT left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ratio. 6 These data suggest that labetalol may induce reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption, thereby increasing exercise tolerance in patients with coronary artery disease, without impairment of left ventricular performance.", 
    "21": "A five-week clinical trial of the concurrent administration of topical timolol maleate and oral acetazolamide was conducted to determine the additivity of the ocular hypotensive effects of the two drugs. One drop of 0.5% timolol maleate, every 12 hours, produced a mean reduction in outflow pressure from baseline of 36.0%. When added to an eye pretreated with oral acetazolamide, timolol caused an additional mean decrease in outflow pressure of 27.6%. Acetazolamide, 500 mg orally every 12 hours, produced a mean reduction in outflow pressure from baseline of 48.6%. When added to an eye receiving topical timolol, oral acetazolamide caused an additional mean decrease in outflow pressure of 43.2%. Concurrent administration of oral acetazolamide and topical timolol reduced outflow pressure only slightly less than the predicted reduction assuming full additivity of the drugs. This study supported the clinical usefulness of concurrent administration of acetazolamide and timolol to lower intraocular pressure.", 
    "22": "1. The effects of intravenous administration of neostigmine and propranolol, individually or in combination, on baroreflex responsiveness have been evaluated in 18 borderline hypertensive subjects and in 14 age-matched control subjects. 2. Baroreceptor sensitivity was tested by evaluating both heart rate response to phenylephrine-induced increase in arterial pressure, and heart rate and blood pressure changes induced by increasing neck-tissue pressure by means of a neck-chamber. 3. In borderline hypertensive subjects a reduced baroreflex responsiveness was demonstrated with both stimuli as compared with normal subjects. Neostigmine administration improved consistently both reflex responses. Similarly, after propranolol treatment, borderline hypertensive subjects showed a significant enhancement of the baroreflex sensitivity. Finally, the combined administration of neostigmine and propranolol restored the baroreflex responses. In fact, both the mean slopes of the regression lines between blood pressure and R-R interval after phenylephrine and the increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate induced by the reduction in carotid transmural pressure in borderline hypertensive subjects were similar to those observed in normals. 4. These findings indicate that in borderline hypertensive subjects the impairment of baroreflex responsiveness is mainly due to abnormalities of autonomic regulation.", 
    "23": "Sotalol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, was given intravenously to 15 patients with accessory atrioventricular pathways during intracardiac electrophysiological studies. Eleven patients had the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and four patients had concealed left sided accessory pathways. Four patients were restudied while receiving oral sotalol. In contrast to the actions typical of beta blocking agents, intravenous sotalol prolonged the effective refractory periods of the ventricles and accessory pathways and reduced the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation in the patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Similar results were obtained with oral administration. These findings support the observation that sotalol, unlike other beta blocking agents. causes acute prolongation of the myocardial action potential and suggest that this action might be of therapeutic use.", 
    "24": "The electrophysiological effects of intravenous sotalol hydrochloride (0.4 mg/kg) were assessed in 24 patients, including 13 with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, undergoing routine electrophysiological study. Fifteen to 30 minutes after sotalol administration there was a significant increase in sinus cycle length and in sinus node recovery time. There was a small increase in the AH interval, but the HV interval was unchanged. The QT and JT intervals, measured during sinus rhythm, were both increased. The atrial, ventricular, and atrioventricular nodal effective refractory periods were all prolonged, as was the atrioventricular nodal functional refractory period. In 13 patients with ventricular pre-excitation there was an increase of the accessory pathway anterograde and retrograde effective refractory periods. In 12 of these 13 sotalol was given during atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia, resulting in termination in five. Tachycardia cycle length increased in all patients, with the major effect being in the atrioventricular direction. Though some of the effects seen in these patients are consistent with the beta adrenergic antagonist properties of sotalol, the effect on atrial, ventricular, and accessory pathway effective refractory periods and on ventricular repolarisation is not typical of that observed with other beta blockers but may be the result of lengthening of the action potential duration. These findings suggest that sotalol may be a more versatile antiarrhythmic agent than other beta receptor antagonists.", 
    "25": "For decades, the preparation of a hyperthyroid patient for surgery took several weeks or months utilizing thyroid blocking agents and iodine. In 1973, a preliminary report of 20 patients with hyperthyroidism treated with propranolol and thyroidectomy was presented. It was found that a thyrotoxic patient could be prepared for surgery, in an emergency, by intravenous propranolol in less than an hour, or electively by oral propranolol within 24 hours. Since then, 140 additional patients have been similarly treated. It continues to be true at this institution that propranolol, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, effectively neutralizes the symptoms of autonomic hyperactivity, including sweating, tremor, fever, dilation of blood vessels, and increased pulse rate without significantly affecting thyroid function. An average dose of 160 mg/day was used, with a range of 40 to 320 mg/day. In none of these patients was iodine used; in fact, its use with propranolol is considered unnecessary. A subtotal, near total, or total thyroidectomy was done in all patients, resulting in a 55% incidence of hypothyroidism. There was no postoperative thyroid storm, nerve injury, or permanent hypoparathyroidism. It is believed that the administration of propranolol alone provides a rapid, safe, and effective preparation of the thyrotoxic patient for thyroidal or extrathyroidal surgical procedures during the perioperative period.", 
    "26": "The effects of high-dose fentanyl-oxygen anesthesia (100 micrograms/kg) on myocardial blood flow (argon washin), myocardial oxygen consumption, myocardial lactate balance, and cardiovascular dynamics were studied in nine patients undergoing three-vessel coronary artery bypass operations. All patients had been on maintenance doses of a beta-receptor blocker (pindolol). Except for pindolol all medication had been discontinued 48 hours prior to the study. Measurements were performed in the awake state, after 10 micrograms/kg fentanyl, after 100 micrograms/kg fentanyl, and during sternotomy. Moderate doses of fentanyl (10 micrograms/kg) produced minimal changes in myocardial blood flow, myocardial oxygen consumption, and cardiovascular dynamics; myocardial oxygen balance as well maintained. Large doses of fentanyl (100 micrograms/kg) produced a 16 per cent decrease in mean aortic pressure, cardiac index did not change significantly, while stroke volume index decreased by 23 per cent. Myocardial oxygen consumption decreased by 14 per cent and myocardial blood flow by 10 per cent. Myocardial lactate production was observed in five patients, indicating myocardial ischemia. During sternotomy arterial pressure and heart rate increased 8 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, resulting in an increase in myocardial work, as reflected by a 38 per cent increase in myocardial oxygen consumption and by a 54 per cent increase in myocardial blood flow. Myocardial lactate production was observed in seven of nine patients. Our data demonstrate that in patients on maintenance doses of beta-receptor blockers, large doses of fentanyl as the sole \"anesthetic\" produce incomplete anesthesia and fail to protect the myocardium from ischemia due to noxious stimuli during coronary artery surgery.", 
    "27": "Electrophysiologic drug testing was performed in nine patients with severely symptomatic sporadic (2 to 13 [mean 4.2] attacks/24 months) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). All patients had control inductions of sustained (greater than 30 seconds) AF by high right atrial stimulation, and attempted inductions following serial administration of drugs. Drugs tested were intravenous procainamide (1.0 to 1.5 gm) (five patients), intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) (three patients), oral quinidine (1.6 to 2.4 gm/day) six patients), oral disopyramide (1.2 to 1.6 gm/day) (four patients), and oral aprindine (100 to 250 mg/day) (four patients). In all patients, one or more drugs prevented induction of sustained AF: procainamide (one patient), quinidine (five patients), disopyramide (four patients), and aprindine (four patients). All patients were treated with drugs which prevented induction of sustained AF and followed for 8 to 40 (mean 24) months. Seven patients tolerated their drugs: six had no AF and one had several short nonsustained attacks. Two patients did not tolerate their drugs: one had paroxysmal palpitation (on decreased aprindine dosage), and one had AF (while off of aprindine). In conclusion, electrophysiologic drug testing is feasible in patients with sporadic PAF. Inability to induce sustained AF following drug administration suggests successful prophylaxis of spontaneous PAF with the same drug.", 
    "28": "The effect of D,L-propranolol (80 mg daily) on the peripheral monodeiodination of rT3, 3',5'-diiodothyronine (3',5'-T2), 3,3'-diiodothyronine (3,3'-T2), and 3'-monoiodothyronine (3'-T1) was studied in seven out-patients with severe pretreatment hypothyroidism. The patients were maintained euthyroid on a constant L-T4 replacement therapy. A bolus injection technique was used; MCR, production rate (PR), and conversion rate were determined using a noncompartmental kinetic model. During D,L-propranolol, serum rT3 and 3',5'-T2 increased (P less than 0.02), and 3,3'-T2 seemed to decrease. The MCRs of rT3, 3',5'-T2, and 3,3'-T2 (P less than 0.02) decreased during drug treatment. The MCR and PR of 3'-T1 were reduced, albeit not significantly (P less than 0.10). The PR of 3,3'-T2 was reduced (P less than 0.02), whereas the PRs of rT3 and 3',5'-T2 were unaltered. The conversion rate of rT3 to 3',5'-T2 was unaltered. No changes were seen in the apparent distribution volumes of the iodothyronines studied. The results are compatible with the assumption that D,L-propranolol, or a metabolite thereof, inhibits the 5'-deiodination of all of the iodothyronines.", 
    "29": "Changes in free fatty acids (FFAs) do not always correlate with variations in drug binding. To dissociate heparin effects on FFAs and drug binding, six healthy fasting subjects received 50 units (USP) IV heparin (Harris L932) with and without protamine (3.2 mg IV). Protamine completely suppressed heparin-induced rises in FFAs and warfarin free fraction (W alpha), but diazepam free fraction (D alpha) increased (P less than 0.005). In vitro, increasing concentrations of heparin added to serum increased D alpha (P less than 0.0005) and W alpha (P less than 0.005) without changing FFAs. In eight subjects given 50 units IV heparin (Harris L014), FFAs (P less than 0.001) and propranolol free fraction (P alpha) rose (P less than 0.01), but variations in FFAs and P alpha did not correlate (r = 0.18). When two different heparin lots (Harris L014 and Organon LA39) were tested in vivo. Harris L014 heparin increased FFAs (P less than 0.005) and P alpha (P less than 0.0005), but variations in FFAs and P alpha correlated poorly (r = 0.43, P less than 0.05). In contrast, the Organon LA39 heparin did not change FFAs, but did increase P alpha (P less than 0.0005); variations in FFAs and P alpha did not correlate (r = 0.22). These results indicate that heparin-induced variations in drug binding are not exclusively related to changes in FFAs.", 
    "30": "To determine the effects of verapamil on left ventricular (LV) systolic function and diastolic filling in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), we performed gated radionuclide angiography at rest and during exercise in 16 symptomatic patients before and during oral verapamil therapy (480 mg/day). Twelve patients were also studied during oral propranolol (160--320 mg/day). LV ejection fraction at rest was normal in 13 patients, but abnormal diastolic filling at rest, defined as peak filling rate (PFR) less than 2.5 end-diastolic volumes (EDV)/sec or time to PFR greater than 180 msec, was present in 15. During verapamil, resting ejection fraction decreased (control 50 +/- 10% [+/- SD), verapamil 45 +/- 12%, p less than 0.005), but resting diastolic filling improved: PFR increased (control 1.9 +/- 0.6 EDV/sec, verapamil 2.3 +/- 0.9 ECV/sec, p less than 0.005) and time to PFR decreased (control 185 +/- 38 msec, verapamil 161 +/- 27 msec, p less than 0.05). Exercise ejection fraction did not change during verapamil (control 42 +/- 13%, verapamil 43 +/- 12%, NS), but exercise PFR increased (control 3.1 +/- 0.9 EDV/sec, verapamil 3.6 +/- 1.1 EDV/sec, p less than 0.05) and exercise time to PFR decreased (control 108 +/- 30 msec, verapamil 91 +/- 17 msec, p less than 0.05). In contrast, propranolol did not alter ejection fraction, PFR, or time to PFR at rest or during exercise. Thus, LV ejection fraction is decreased by verapamil at rest but is unchanged during exercise. While LV systolic function is not improved by verapamil, LV diastolic filling is enhanced by verapamil, both at rest and during exercise. These mechanisms may account in part for the symptomatic improvement in many patients during verapamil therapy.", 
    "31": "The left ventricular (LV) and coronary vascular effects of prazosin, a drug that reduces peripheral vascular resistance by blocking postsynaptic alpha receptors, were examined in conscious dogs. Prazosin, 0.07 mg/kg/min i.v. for 7 minutes, induced sustained hypotensive effects for more than 12 hours. The peak effects occurred 30-45 minutes after administration. Prazosin increased heart rate by 28 +/- 9%, did not change mean coronary blood flow significantly, decreased mean arterial pressure by 15 +/- 4%, LV end-diastolic diameter by 10 +/- 2%, LV end-systolic diameter by 8 +/- 2%, late diastolic coronary resistance by 22 +/- 7%, and LV dP/dt by 9 +/- 4%. These effects of prazosin were not altered substantially by maintaining heart rate constant with electrical pacing or by pretreatment with beta-adrenergic blockade. However, after chronic reserpine treatment, prazosin did not reduce either mean arterial pressure or late diastolic coronary resistance. The alpha-blocking properties of the drug were established when prazosin attenuated pressure responses to phenylephrine, norepinephrine and bilateral carotid occlusion. Thus, in conscious dogs with heart rate constant, prazosin, by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, induces prolonged coronary vasodilation associated with reductions in the major determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, e.g., arterial and LV pressures, LV end-diastolic diameter and LV dP/dt. However, the coronary vasodilation was not intense enough to increase coronary blood flow above control levels.", 
    "32": "Prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) decreases blood pressure. Perfusion of isolated hog kidney by propranolol in modified Krebs-Ringer solution resulted in a significant increase in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, the major metabolite of PGI2. Prostaglandin E2 and renin activity remained unchanged. Because the concentration of PGI2-like substance in the renal vein has been shown to be greater than in the renal artery after bradykinin infusion, a contribution of PGI2 to the regulation of blood pressure was proposed. Isoproterenol has been shown to augment urinary kallikrein, but the effect of urinary kallikrein on propranolol is unclear. With a modified Krebs-Ringer solution free of plasma kininogen, a renin substrate, it was concluded that propranolol (1) induces PGI2 release from the kidney, which may contribute to a direct antihypertensive action of this beta-adrenergic blocking agent, and (2) decreases urinary kallikrein.", 
    "33": "We conducted a two-part study to determine whether the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the rise in splanchnic vascular resistance (SVR) during heat stress (rectal temperature was raised 1 degree C). In experiment 1 (control) seven men on a normal salt diet were directly heated (water-perfused suits) for 40-50 min. Arterial pressure (85 Torr) was unchanged; plasma renin activity (PRA) rose from 102 to 239 ng angiotensin I.100 ml-1.3 h-1; and SVR increased 73% (from 63 to 109 units). Experiment 2 was a repetition of experiment 1 on the same subjects, except that propranolol (10 mg iv) was given at the onset of heating to block renin release. Propranolol attenuated the rise in heart rate and reduced mean arterial pressure from 82 to 72 Torr; it blocked the rise in PRA with heating in two subjects, reduced it in three, but increased it in two. Although changes in SVR paralleled those in PRA in three subjects, SVR still rose 60% (from 58 to 99 units) after PRA rise was blocked. In both experiments, plasma norepinephrine concentration rose indicating increased sympathetic nervous activity. During mild heat stress, increased PRA is not a major factor in the increase of SVR.", 
    "34": "The antihypertensive effects of hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone when added to treatment with metoprolol were compared in a double-blind trial comprising 55 previously untreated patients with essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients became normotensive on metoprolol alone, whereas ten patients were randomized to additional therapy with hydrochlorothiazide and ten to spironolactone. Eleven patients dropped out of the trial. Spironolactone was significantly more effective than hydrochlorothiazide as regards reduction of the diastolic blood pressure, Side effects were few and mild during all phases of the study.", 
    "35": "The influence of both plasma glucose and insulin levels on the rate of carbohydrate oxidation was separately assessed in control subjects. During inhibition of endogenous insulin secretion by epinephrine + propranolol, glucose infusion produced an increase in carbohydrate oxidation when plasma glucose levels reached approximately 200 mg/100 ml. Addition of exogenous insulin to the glucose infusion was accompanied by a further rise in carbohydrate oxidation and a decrease in plasma glucose level. It was concluded that hyperglycemia without insulin response represents a compensatory mechanism which favours peripheral glucose utilization.", 
    "36": "In six patients with chemical diabetes, insulin resistance was assessed by the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) level during a constant infusion of epinephrine, propranolol, glucose and insulin. During the infusion, the patients had elevated SSPG levels (174 +/- 20 mg/100 ml), compared with six control subjects (96 +/- 3 mg/100 ml, p less than 0.005), demonstrating increased insulin resistance. However, during the infusion, the rate of carbohydrate oxidation was similar in both groups. These results suggest that when insulinemia is controlled, the plasma glucose concentration in chemical diabetics during glucose infusion reaches hyperglycemic levels allowing normalisation of carbohydrate oxidation. Hyperglycemia can thus be considered to be a regulatory mechanism favouring glucose uptake and oxidation in patients with chemical diabetes.", 
    "37": "1 The anti-hypertensive effects and safety of labetalol have been evaluated in multicentre clinical trials in Japan based on unified study protocols. The results of three studies are reported. 2 A total of 178 patients with essential hypertension were treated with labetalol for 12 weeks, 127 of them with labetalol alone (monotherapy) and the other 51 with labetalol plus diuretics (combined therapy). 3 Satisfactory antihypertensive effects were achieved in 76 of the 119 assessable patients in the monotherapy group and 25 of the 49 in the combined therapy group. The mean daily doses of labetalol were 329 mg in the monotherapy group and 374 mg in the combined therapy group. Seven patients (six in the monotherapy group; one in the combined therapy group) were withdrawn from the trials due to side-effects. 4 Sixty-one patients with hypertension were treated with labetalol alone or combined with diuretics for 6 months or longer. In most of these patients, good blood pressure control was achieved. No patients had to discontinue the treatment due to side-effects. The mean daily doses of labetalol were stabilised in and after week 8 of the treatment at an average of 260 mg in the monotherapy and 450 mg in the combined therapy. Tolerance to the anti-hypertensive effect did not develop. 5 Thirty patients with phaeochromocytoma were treated with labetalol and good blood pressure control was achieved in 21 of them. The effects of labetalol were better in patients with predominantly adrenaline-secreting tumours, and better in patients with sustained hypertensive type than in those with paroxysmal hypertensive type.", 
    "38": "1 Labetalol was administered to 18 hypertensive patients for an average duration of 2.44 weeks, with an average final daily dose of 1.65 g (principally to study its short-term haemodynamic effects). 2 Labetalol decreased resting heart rate by 16% and maximal exercise heart rate by 21%; the phenylephrine-induced increase in systolic brachial arterial pressure was reduced by 36%. 3 During labetalol treatment brachial arterial pressure was decreased by 29/15 mmHg in the recumbent position, by 41/23 mmHg at rest sitting and by 53/23 mmHg at maximal exercise; total peripheral resistance was not significantly affected at rest recumbent but was reduced at sitting and at exercise; cardiac output was decreased in all conditions. 4 Labetalol reduced mean pulmonary arterial and capillary wedge pressures only in the sitting position. Pulmonary vascular resistance remained unchanged. 5 The drug produced significant decreases in plasma renin activity and in plasma aldosterone concentration.", 
    "39": "Clonidine hydrochloride (Catapres), a potent antihypertensive agent, has been in clinical use since 1974 in the United States. Clonidine, an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist, stimulates central alpha receptors in the depressor site of the vasomotor center of the medulla oblongata and hypothalamus, which diminishes efferent sympathetic tone to the heart, kidneys, and peripheral vasculature with a concomitant increase in vagal activity. Hemodynamic and renal effects include reduction in supine and erect blood pressure, heart rate, total peripheral resistance, plasma renin activity, and urinary aldosterone and catecholamine excretion, with little effect on resting cardiac output, response to exercise, and preservation of renal function. Clonidine alone produces a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure in all degrees of hypertension during acute and chronic administration, with little or no tendency toward tolerance or postural hypotension. Its antihypertensive potency is enhanced with the concomitant use of a diuretic or vasodilator, and it may be used in place of a beta blocker with equal efficacy in the diuretic plus vasodilator combination. Serious adverse effects are uncommon, with more than 93% of patients tolerating the drug well. Sedation and dry mouth, the most common adverse effects, are usually related to dose and duration and are minimized by gradually increasing the dose and by taking the major portion of the twice-daily schedule at bedtime. Clonidine may be safely given to patients with congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, obstructive lung disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus. Clonidine is one of the most versatile and effective agents presently available for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "40": "Several prospective randomized studies of medical or surgical therapy have not shown that either form of management alone is uniformly superior with respect to mortality for unstable angina pectoris. Patients managed medically have a greater incidence of angina pectoris. Earlier studies indicated a higher rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction with urgent surgery. Present management includes hospitalization and early intensive medical therapy with nitrates and, usually, beta-blocking agents. Coronary arteriography is advised within a few days. If the patient has left main coronary artery disease or three-vessel disease, early coronary artery bypass graft surgery within days to a couple of weeks is advised. Otherwise, medical management is advised and elective surgery can be performed if the patient remains symptomatic.", 
    "41": "The safety and efficacy of acebutolol in suppressing ventricular ectopy was evaluated in 60 males (average 59 years) using 24-hour Holter recordings and a double-blind, randomized, crossover protocol. Acebutolol, 200 mg and 400 mg thrice daily, was compared with placebo. Only patients who had a mean of at least 30 ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) per hour on three 24-hour control Holter recordings were included. Analysis of Holter recordings revealed greater than 70% reduction in VPCs/hour from control levels during acebutolol therapy in over 50% of the 60 patients; dose-related reduction in the mean number of single and paired VPCs and ventricular tachycardia episodes (p less than 0.05) by acebutolol; and significant, asymptomatic reduction in resting heart rate and blood pressure. All side effects were transient. Acebutolol was discontinued because of side effects in one patient only.", 
    "42": "1 Labetalol has been used to treat 163 patients at the Dunedin Hypertension Clinic for periods up to 6.5 y, and of 128 patients in a New Zealand multicentre study for 2 yr. 2 Labetalol was often effective when other anti-hypertensive agents, including beta-blockers, had failed. It was usually given with a diuretic. 3 Mean daily dose was 700 mg (range 100-2400 mg). No tolerance to the anti-hypertensive effect was seen. 4 Some postural-induced decrease in blood pressure on labetalol was common. 5 Side-effects led to withdrawal of labetalol in about 25% of patients, mainly during the first few months of therapy. Another 25% had minor side-effects but could continue with the drug. 6 There were three types of side-effects (in order of frequency): (a) non-specific, (b) related to alpha-blockade and (c) related to beta-blockade. The latter were much less troublesome than on \"pure\" beta-blockers. 7 There was no significant evidence of renal haematological or hepatic toxicity. 8 Anti-nuclear antibody tests became positive on labetalol in about 15%, usually at low titres but in one patient the titre increased to a high level and fell when labetalol was stopped. 9 In a subset of 25 patients who took labetalol for the longest time (up to 6.5 yr) there was a 16% incidence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies.", 
    "43": "The progress of pharmacological management of schizophrenia is briefly reviewed, highlighting some of the major limitations especially in regard to side-effects which have been identified. The importance of the quality of life issues in chronic patients undergoing pharmacological treatment is stressed. A possible new approach is the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs which may have symptomatic effects as well as quality of life effects.", 
    "44": "The effects of graded isometric exercise on left ventricular performance were characterized in 11 male patients (53 +/- 2 years) with coronary artery disease (CAD) and in 12 normal subjects (11 male and one female 35 +/- 5 years). The echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function at rest were similar in both groups. Heart rate and blood pressure increased significantly in both groups in response to 40 and 60% of handgrip maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased significantly (from 50 +/- 1 to 56 +/- 1 mm; P less than 0.01) with 60% of MVC in CAD group but not in the healthy subjects. The patients with CAD also exhibited significant (P less than 0.01) increases in end-systolic dimension (from 34 +/- 1 to 40 +/- 2 with 40% and to 44 +/- 1 mm with 60% MVC). End-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions did not change during isometric exercise in the healthy subjects. In the CAD group mVCF decreased significantly (from 1.08 +/- 0.06 to 0.86 +/- 0.06 with 40% and to 0.74 +/- 0.04 d . s-1 with 60% MVC; P less than 0.01). At comparable mean blood pressures, mVCF was significantly lower in the CAD group than in normal subjects. These results demonstrate that progressive deterioration of left ventricular function during increasing levels of isometric exercise in patients with CAD can be detected with echocardiography.", 
    "45": "In 11 pregnant rabbits we induced labor by parenteral infusion of Dinoprost (F2) (0.05 mg/min). By application of Fenoterol (0.01 mg/min) we had complete labor inhibition (P). Increasing dosages of Atenolol (T1 = 0.05 mg/min, T2 = 0.10 mg/min, T3 = 0.25 mg/min) followed. We registered systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure directly after punction of a femoralis, cardiac frequency, and labor by integration of action potentials of uterus. Cardiac frequency decreased with increasing amounts of Atenolol. Mean blood pressure fell significantly under Fenoterol medication. There is no further decrement by additional application of high dosages of Atenolol. A certain dosage of Atenolol could be defined, that does not increase labor activity under Fenoterol medication but does decrease cardiac frequency without influence on mean blood pressure.", 
    "46": "Acute hemodynamic changes induced by Betaxolol (B.) were studied in 10 patients (7 men, 3 women, mean age: 36 years), with uncomplicated essential hypertension. The brachial artery was cannulated with a short Teflon catheter and Swan-Ganz catheter was introduced into the pulmonary artery. Brachial (BAP) and Pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP), cardiac output (dye dilution) were recorded before (To) and after intravenous infusion of B. (0.2 mg/kg) during 5 minutes (T1), followed by the infusion of B. at a rate of 0.4 mg/kg during 15 minutes (T2). Cardiac index (C.I.), Stroke index (S.I.), Systemic Vascular (SVR) and Pulmonary Vascular Resistances (PVR), Left Ventricular Stroke Work Index (LVSWI) were calculated. C.I. declined significantly. This resulted from a significant decrease of heart rate, since S.I. was unsignificantly changed. BAP (systolic and mean) decreased significantly, since unsignificant changes of PAP were noted. SVR and PVR were significantly increased and LVSWI was significantly decreased. Plasmatic Renin Activity was unsignificantly decreased.", 
    "47": "23 normotensive subjects in good health are submitted to a \"test de l'expos\u00e9\" and 17 others are submitted to a test on an ergometric bicycle and a hand grip stress test. These tests are performed twice at one week interval, with or without treatment with acebutolol, in double blind. HR,SBP and DBP are measured simultaneously before, during and after each test. Every stress is responsible for a marked increase in the parameters according to different modalities. With ACEBUTOLOL treatment, during the test described and during dynamic stress on ergometric bicycle, HR and SBP are always less elevated. The decreases are dependent either on the stress level or on the reactivity of the subjects. DBP is however basely modified. Under static stress, there is a decrease in HR, in SBP, but also in DBP; actually increase in this parameter is important during this type of stress.", 
    "48": "The mechanical properties of a collaterally ventilating lung segment were studied in 18 anesthetized paralyzed mongrel dogs artificially ventilated with room air end-tidal CO2 fraction = 5%. Nine dogs were pretreated with propranolol, and nine dogs were not. With 0, 5, or 12% CO2 in O2 flowing into the segment, steady-state resistance of segmental airways (Rss) and time for 90% pressure equilibration (T90) between the segment and airway opening after flow was discontinued were determined at functional residual capacity with the vagus nerve ipsilateral to the segment intact, sectioned, or electrically stimulated. Vagal stimulation increased Rss and T90 at all CO2 levels, whereas unilateral vagotomy had no effect. Propranolol treatment enhanced the increase in Rss caused by vagal stimulation at low but not at high CO2 levels, suggesting that high CO2 mimics the effect of propranolol on Rss. High levels of CO2 did not have the same effect as propranolol on T90, propranolol treatment reducing the increase in T90 caused by vagal stimulation at high but not at low CO2 levels. These results demonstrate that local changes in alveolar CO2 tensions modify but do not abolish the effect of vagal stimulation on collateral ventilation.", 
    "49": "Ten patients with autonomously functioning euthyroid multinodular goitre received propranolol (Inderal Retard 160 mg daily) for 4 weeks in order to investigate whether normalization of the TRH test or an increased TSH response to TRH could be obtained by decreasing serum T3 levels. Serum T3 decreased significantly after 2 and 4 weeks of propranolol administration. Serum T4 increased during this period, although the change was only significant after 4 weeks of propranolol. T3 resin uptake did not change. The TSH response to TRH increased significantly during the administration of propranolol. Mean delta TSH basally was 1.0, range 0-3.9 mU/l, and mean delta TSH after 4 weeks of propranolol was 2.4, range 0-9.3 mU/l. A strong correlation was found between the increase in delta TSH and the decrease in serum T3 after 4 weeks of propranolol. After withdrawal, delta TSH and T3 returned to premedication levels. Our data suggest that T3 is an important factor in the impairment of the TSH response to TRH in our patients. Normalization of the TRH test was, however, not obtained. These findings support the concept of subclinical hyperthyroidism in 'euthyroid' multinodular goitre with autonomous function.", 
    "50": "In a double-blind, crossover study in 20 patients with stable angina pectoris, the effects of long-acting propranolol, 160 mg administered once daily for 4 weeks, were compared with those of standard propranolol, 40 mg given four times daily for 4 weeks. The patients suffered no adverse effects when they were switched between treatment schedules. The average number of episodes of angina during the 4 weeks on long-acting propranolol was 7.3 and on standard propranolol. 6.3. Average nitroglycerin consumption was 5.8 and 4.9 tablets during therapy with these two drug programs. The resting values for heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product were similar when determined 25.4 hours after a dose of long-acting propranolol and 10.7 hours after standard propranolol. When the patients exercised at these times, patients on long-acting propranolol and standard propranolol had similar walking times to the onset of angina and to the development of moderate angina. The values for heart rate, systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product were similar at rest and during exercise during these two treatment programs. We conclude that long-acting propranolol administered in a dose of 160 mg daily is as effective as 50 mg of standard propranolol four times daily.", 
    "51": "1. The role of the autonomic innervation to the pancreas in mediating the release of insulin in response to exogenous glucose has been investigated in conscious weaned lambs 4-5 months after birth. 2. The incremental rise in mean plasma insulin concentration was consistently lower in lambs with cut splanchnic nerves, which had been pre-treated with atropine (0.2 mg kg-1), than in normal control lambs, although the differences did not achieve statistical significance. 3. Pre-treatment with propranolol (0.25 mg kg-1) effectively suppressed release of insulin in response to exogenous glucose in atropinized lambs with intact splanchnic nerves, but not in atropinized lambs with cut splanchnic nerves. 4. The rise in mean plasma insulin concentration was significantly greater in lambs pre-treated with atropine (0.2 mg kg-1) and phentolamine (0.1 mg kg-1 initially, followed by 0.02 mg kg-1 min-1) than in atropinized lambs with cut splanchnic nerves. 5. It is concluded that release of insulin in response to exogenous glucose is normally modified by both sympathetic alpha-adrenergic inhibition and beta-adrenergic excitation in this species.", 
    "52": "The ontogeny of the suppressive effect of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline, on fetal growth hormone (GH) release was examined in 14 chronically-catheterized ovine fetuses. Isoprenaline was administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 h (200 micrograms/kg). In seven fetuses between 72 and 99 days of gestation, isoprenaline had no effect on fetal plasma GH concentrations. In seven older fetuses between 114 and 140 days of gestation, isoprenaline infusion suppressed (P less than 0.02) fetal GH release. No effect was observed in five saline-treated control fetuses (119-131 days). Propranolol (250 micrograms/kg i.v.) administered 5 min prior to the isoprenaline infusion to four fetuses (117-136 days) delayed (P less than 0.05) the onset of the suppressive effect of isoprenaline demonstrating that the action of isoprenaline was mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. Propranolol alone (n = 6) had no effect. These observations demonstrate that the potential for beta-adrenergic inhibition of fetal GH release differentiates after 100 days of gestation. Comparison with previous studies of the ontogenesis of the control of GH secretion suggests that the hypothalamic beta-adrenergic control of GH release differentiates with an intermediate time course compared to other potential neuroendocrine controls.", 
    "53": "The vasoconstrictor responses induced by isoproterenol in cylindrical segments of posterior communicating and femoral arteries of the cat were analyzed. For this purpose, dose-response curves for isoproterenol before and after addition of propranolol (5 X 10(-9) to 10(-6) M) or phentolamine (10(-6) M) to the bath were determined. Propranolol did not significantly change the contraction induced by isoproterenol in cerebral and femoral arteries. Phentolamine reduced the contractile responses of cerebral arteries evoked by all concentrations of isoproterenol. However phentolamine shifted the dose-response curve to isoproterenol in femoral arteries to the right, the pA2 value for this antagonist being 6.74. These results indicate that the alfa adrenoceptors are involved in the contraction caused by isoproterenol in femoral arteries, whereas in brain arteries other receptors or mechanisms are also likely involved.", 
    "54": "The positive inotropic effects of catecholamines were studied on samples of ventricular myocardium taken from patients undergoing open heart surgery. The adenylyl cyclase and binding of 3H-(-)-bupranolol were examined in membrane particles prepared from similarly obtained samples. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for (-)-bupranolol was estimated in 4 ways: blockade of the positive inotropic effects of catecholamines, blockade of the stimulation of the adenylyl cyclase by catecholamines, saturation binding of 3H-(-)-bupranolol, inhibition of the binding of 3H-(-)-bupranolol by its unlabeled stereoisomers. The estimates of KD fall in the range 0.5-1.4 nmol/l. The stereo-selectivity ratio (KD (+)-isomer/KD (-)-isomer) is 73. Both values for bupranolol are very similar in cat and man. The inotropic potency of (-)-noradrenaline is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher in cat heart tissues than in tissues from human hearts. The difference in inotropic potencies between species is only partially accounted for by the five-fold lower potency of (-)-noradrenaline for the human heart adenylyl cyclase as compared to the cat enzyme.", 
    "55": "The effects of age on cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor linked adenylate cyclase system were studied using homogenates and membrane fractions of ventricular myocardium from young (3-4 months' old) and aged (24-25 months' old) rats. The number of beta-adrenergic receptor sites and the basal adenylate cyclase activities were essentially similar in young and aged hearts. On the other hand, striking age-associated alterations were seen in the properties of beta-receptors and adenylate cyclase in cardiac membranes. (A) The beta-receptor affinities for catecholamine agonists were reduced 10- to 20-fold in aged compared to young heart; the receptor affinity for antagonists were unaffected by age. (B) Guanine nucleotides caused a 9- to 17-fold reduction in beta-receptor affinity for isoproterenol in young heart; this guanine nucleotide-promoted reduction in receptor affinity for agonist was virtually absent in aged heart. (C) Guanine nucleotide-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase by isoproterenol was only 20-50% in aged heart compared to three-fold in young heart; beta-receptor-independent activation of the cyclase by guanine nucleotides and NaF were also reduced similarly in aged heart. These results demonstrate a marked age-associated deterioration in the functional integrity of beta-receptor linked adenylate cyclase system in aged heart. Further, the findings identify beta-receptor and guanine nucleotide regulatory protein as the components of the cyclase system affected in aging. It is suggested that the failure to form a \"high-affinity\" agonist-receptor complex, owing to the age-related decrement in receptor affinity for agonists, and the apparent inability of guanine nucleotide regulatory protein to effect appropriate molecular transitions at the level of both beta-receptor and the catalytic unit (i.e. the cyclase enzyme), contribute to the loss of catecholamine- and guanine nucleotide-responsiveness of adenylate cyclase in aged heart. This age-associated abnormality provides a biochemical basis for the well-recognized decline in adrenergic control of aging myocardium.", 
    "56": "The paramyxoviruses measles (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, SSPE) virus and canine distemper virus (CDV) cause an impairment of the catecholamine-induced beta-adrenergic receptor-dependent cAMP generation in persistently infected C6 rat glioma cells. In C6 cells persistently infected with CDV the number of receptors is greatly reduced. Hirata and Axelrod have shown that the number of beta-adrenergic receptors could be regulated by methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine, resulting in lecithin synthesis [Hirata, F. & Axelrod, J. (1980) Science 209, 1082-1090]. We have therefore studied the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine in persistently infected cells by the incorporation of [3H]methyl groups from [methyl-3H]methionine into phosphatidylethanolamine. In both infected systems, C6/ SSPE and C6/CDV, we observed a total loss of catecholamine-stimulated beta-adrenergic receptor-dependent methylation, whereas the beta-receptor-independent methylation of phospholipids was unchanged.", 
    "57": "1 Following administration to rats of an electroconvulsive shock (ECS) which resulted in a major tonic-clonic seizure, no changes in [3H]-diazepam binding characteristics were observed in cortex or hippocampus with either a well washed membrane preparation or a crude synaptosomal preparation. 2 No changes were observed in [3H]-diazepam binding in any other brain region examined 30 min after an ECS. 3 Thirty min following an ECS, regional brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations increased in hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus. Only in the hippocampus did the increase occur within 5 min of the seizure. 4 Similar increases in GABA concentration were seen after a bicuculline-induced seizure but not after seizure induced by flurothyl; both treatments produced a tonic-clonic seizure. 5 Pretreatment of the rats with (+)-propranolol 5 min before the ECS abolished the tonic extension and prevented the brain GABA concentration changes that occur 30 min after the seizure. 6 No increase in GABA concentration was seen in hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus 30 min after the final ECS of a course of 10 ECS given once daily for 10 days. In contrast a marked increase in striatal GABA concentration was observed. 7 These changes in GABA biochemistry following a seizure are discussed in relation to the post-ictal rise in seizure threshold that is occurring at the same time.", 
    "58": "THe interaction of macromolecular alprenolol derivatives with beta-adrenoreceptors of rat heart, lung, and erythrocytes and frog erythrocytes has been studied. Macromolecular derivatives were prepared by covalently coupling alprenolol to dextrans containing a homologous series of spacer arms of various lengths. The affinity of these macromolecules for frog erythrocyte membranes increased with increasing length of spacer arm. In contrast, the affinity of these macromolecules for all mammalian membrane preparations was weak and insensitive to the length of the spacer arm. The inhibition of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to rat heart, lung, and erythrocyte membrane preparations by these macromolecular derivatives was more than 1000-fold less potent than inhibition by alprenolol. The results suggest different structural characteristics between mammalian and amphibian beta-adrenoreceptors; however, apparently only small differences between mammalian receptors could be distinguished with these probes.", 
    "59": "Hypothyroidism alters the responsiveness of sympathetically innervated structures. The present work was done to determine if the responsiveness of the intrinsic cardiac nerves (ICN) to nicotine is also affected by thyroidectomy (THX). Mongrel dogs were anesthetized and an electrode catheter was advanced into the right atrium for recording His bundle activity (HB). A second cannula was placed into the carotid artery with its tip near the coronary ostia, so that the responses to the drugs injected would be confined to the heart. Changes in the A-H interval of the HB were recorded in response to both acetylcholine (ACH) 2-50 ug, and nicotine HCl (NIC) 5-100 ug, before and after beta blockade with metoprolol (1-4 mg). There were no important differences between the two groups in the responses of A-V nodal conduction to ACH over the dose range used. However, the THX animals showed an apparent increase in responsiveness to NIC; ie., ca. 5% decrease in A-H at 10 ug (control) compared to ca. 30% increase after THX. The apparent catecholamine-releasing effect of NIC was also enhanced in the THX animals. In addition, the responses to ACH and NIC were compared in animals both 'on' and 'off' cardiac bypass. The data suggest that hypothyroidism increases the effectiveness of nicotinic stimulation of intracardiac neurons.", 
    "60": "DNA damage and repair in the nonischemic area of the heart were analyzed after experimental myocardial infarction to evaluate the effect on these processes of the beta-blocker inderal and lipid peroxidation inhibitor ionol. It was found that in the nonischemic area of the heart, DNA damage was manifested by the decreased polymerism averted to a significant degree by inderal and ionol which interfered with postinfarction activation of lipid peroxidation. Accordingly, inderal and, to a greater degree, ionol reduced postinfarction activation of DNA repair synthesis in the nonischemic area of the heart.", 
    "61": "Twenty patients with severe hypertension and chronic renal failure were given Captopril during a one year period. Hypertension was always severe: BP: 193 +/- 11.8 mmHg/120.2 +/- 6.7 mm Hg. Mean glomerular filtration rate (GRF) was 42 +/- 10 ml/mn and renal plasma flow (RPF) was 160 +/- 35 ml/min. Mean plasma renin activity was 1.5 +/- 1.1 ng/ml/h and plasma aldosterone 15.9 +/- 1.9 ng/100 ml. Captopril was given in daily doses from 75 to 300 mg. Furosemide was added in 13 cases, and b\u00eata inhibitions in 10 cases. Blood pressure and renal function were measured eight days, every month end after one year of treatment: the fall in diastolic blood pressure was 13 p. 100 after eight days, 23 p. 100 after one year; a period of at least 6 months was necessary to obtain normal blood pressure values; and after one year blood pressure was normalized (diastolic BP less than 90 mmHg) in 19 patients. Renal function was compared with pretreatment values, after 8 days and one year: --RPF was increased (+18 p. 100 and +10.3 p. 100); --GFR was unchanged (+3,8 p. 100 and -8.8 p. 100); --filtration fraction was significantly decreased: (-12.3 p. 100 and -18.3 p. 100); --sodium excretion rate (+16 p. 100 and +9.9 p. 100) and kaliemia increased (+10 p. 100 and +8 p. 100) but severe hyperkalemia never occurred; --PRA increased (+270 p. 100 and +400 p. 100); --Plasma aldosterone was decreased after eight days --28.9 p. 100 but identical to control after one year -4.4 p. 100. Diuretics were efficient to enhance the antipressor of Captopril, whereas b\u00eata inhibitions appeared less useful, and may be indicated only when tachycardia occurs. These results show that long term use of Captopril alone or associated with Furosemide, can normalise blood pressure in patients with renal insufficiency, without any impairment in GFR, and with an increase in RBF.", 
    "62": "Plasma levels of cholesterol (C), triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL) (in total plasma, very low density [VLDL], low density (LDL), and high density [HDL] lipoproteins) and of two apolipoproteins (apo-B and apo-A) were studied in 13 hyperlipidemic patients suffering from hypertension and/or stable angina and treated by metoprolol or propranolol. Propranolol reduced the low density and high density lipoprotein phospholipids by 26% and 11%, respectively, and increased the very low density phospholipids by 24%. Metoprolol had only a transient effect on high density lipoprotein phospholipids. VLDL apolipoprotein-B was markedly increased by propranolol (67%), whereas apolipoprotein-A was slightly (8%) increased during metoprolol treatment. The reduced low density lipoprotein phospholipids and the increased high density lipoprotein apo-A correlated with the plasma concentration of propranolol and metoprolol, respectively. These results suggest that the comparative effects of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents on lipoprotein metabolism should be considered in their long-term use in patients with risk factors for hypertension and myocardial infarction.", 
    "63": "In order to evaluate the negative inotropic effects of sotalol, metoprolol, and propranolol in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured with radionuclide angiography and echocardiography. Fifteen patients entered the study, which was designed as a randomized crossover trial. The patients served as their own control at all times. Surprisingly, LVEF increased when measured by echocardiography in all three treatment periods, and decreased in the propranolol period when measured by radionuclide methods. The changes were not significant. There was no negative inotropic effect registered during any of the three drug treatments.", 
    "64": "The effects of IV histamine infusion and beta-adrenergic blockade on pulmonary function were studied in neonatal Holstein calves, beta-Adrenergic blockade with IV propranolol increased total pulmonary resistance, but was without effect on lung compliance, lung volumes, and gas exchange. beta-Adrenergic blockade enhanced the histamine-induced increase in total pulmonary resistance and the decrease in dynamic and quasistatic compliance, lung volumes, and arterial oxygen tension. These data indicate that beta-adrenergic receptors may be present in the large and small airways of cattle and they modulate the effects of bronchoconstrictor agents as in other species.", 
    "65": "Since its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), timolol has been widely used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma. Contrary to the clinical trials before FDA approval, many reports of possible ocular and systemic side effects have now appeared. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systemic effects occur relatively often and are attributable to beta-adrenergic antagonism, but central nervous system (CNS) effects are not so explainable. The most frequent ocular side effects are instillation pain and blurred vision, often requiring discontinuation of timolol. Superficial punctate keratitis and associated reduced corneal sensitivity have been reported and pose a risk for affected contact lens wearers. The incidence of side effects in two prospective studies was about 20%, with some 40% of those having to discontinue timolol. Of optometric interest are reports that timolol increases the electro-oculogram (EOG) ratio (Arden Index), and that it may be used to lower intraocular pressure in acute angle closure when pilocarpine alone is unsuccessful.", 
    "66": "A series of phenethanolamines (3) based on salicylamide has been prepared and shown to possess beta-adrenergic blocking properties. When the basic nitrogen atom was substituted by some aralkyl groups, the compounds also blocked alpha-adrenoceptors. The 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl derivative labetalol (34) is antihypertensive in animals and man, and syntheses of its four stereoisomers are described. The enantiomer 90 with the R configuration at both asymmetric centers possessed most of the beta-blocking activity but little alpha-blocking activity. That with the S configuration at the alcoholic carbon and the R configuration on the amino substituent, 89, is predominantly an alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agent.", 
    "67": "Circular smooth muscle strips taken from the body region of the guinea-pig stomach responded to dopamine and noradrenaline with contraction at lower concentrations followed by relaxation at higher concentrations. A beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation response was excluded by propranolol treatment and this allowed the remaining alpha-adrenoceptor involvement with relaxation and contraction to be incisively differentiated in terms of two distinct alpha-adrenoceptor mechanisms. Thus, the relaxation responses to the catecholamines were mimicked by phenylephrine and antagonized by prazosin, phentolamine but not by yohimbine or rauwolscine. In contrast, the catecholamine-induced contractions were mimicked by clonidine and antagonized by yohimbine and phentolamine but not by prazosin. It is therefore concluded that the alpha mechanisms via which dopamine and noradrenaline are able to relax and contract the circular smooth muscle from the body region of guinea-pig stomach are of the alpha 1- and alpha 2-type respectively.", 
    "68": "Beta adrenergic blocking agents are effective antianginal agents and reduce the frequency of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin consumption, and improve exercise tolerance in patients with stable exertional angina pectoris. These drugs are effective in the management of exertional angina pectoris primarily due to their ability to block beta 1 receptors and thereby competitively blocking the effects of sympathetic stimulation (i.e. increase in myocardial oxygen demand) during exercise. In this report other pharmacological properties of these agents i.e. membrane stabilizing activity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and cardioselectivity are of little importance. Comparative studies with beta adrenergic blocking agents with different ancillary properties, utilizing intravenous preparations, acute single and multiple oral dosing and sustained oral therapy prescribed for several weeks or months, show that if used in equipotent doses all beta adrenergic blocking agents are equally effective antianginal agents. It should be recognized that therapy with these agents may precipitate heart failure or aggravate bronchospasm in susceptible patients. This can occur with cardioselective agents and with beta blockers which also have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "69": "The introduction of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs initiated a breakthrough in the treatment of various cardiovascular disorders within the last 20 years. The major cardiac indications for beta-blockers are coronary heart disease, hypertension and arrhythmias. No one beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug has been shown to be more efficacious than another, and efficacy can be related to the stereo-selective blockade of adrenergic beta-receptors. The major side effects and the contraindications are mainly due to beta-adrenoceptor blockade in combination with the organ-specific distribution of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors. In addition to their specific antagonism beta-receptor blocking drugs can differ in beta 1-adrenoceptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) as well as in nonspecific effects. However, these ancillary properties do not seem to be of importance for the therapeutic effect of these drugs. A relative beta 1-selectivity is probably able to reduce the incidence of side effects e.g. in asthmatics, in diabetic patients and in patients with peripheral vascular disease, however, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists should be used with caution in these patients, At the present time, there is no convincing evidence that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with partial agonist activity are superior in patients with congestive heart failure or in asthmatics. Except at high dosages the nonspecific local anaesthetic or cardiodepressant effects of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (propranolol-oxprenolol-group) also do not seem to be of importance in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, lipophilicity of a lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor antagonists of the propranolol-oxprenolol-group exhibit serum half-lives in the range of two to six hours, whereas half-lives of six to 24 hours are found with the hydrophilic compounds sotalol, practolol, nadolol and atenolol, respectively, while with regard to lipophilicity and serum half-lives timolol, metoprolol, pindolol and acebutolol fall midway between these extremes. It was well established that the duration of action of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is about two or three times longer than would be expected from the pharmacokinetic data. This can be explained by the fact that the pharmacodynamic effect obeys zero order kinetics whereas the decline in serum concentration follows first order kinetics. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are of great value in the therapy inasmuch as the dosage interval must be modified accordingly: whereas the lipophilic compounds have to be taken two to four times per day, one dosage per day seems sufficient with the hydrophilic compounds."
