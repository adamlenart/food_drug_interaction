    "0": "Essential tremor may not represent a single condition. Subclassifications include kinetic predominant tremor; combined resting-postural tremor; primary writing tremor; isolated voice, chin, or tongue tremor; and orthostatic truncal tremor. We report patients with these disorders. An association of these conditions with essential tremor is suggested by a high occurrence of a family history of essential tremor, frequent presence of a mild postural tremor, and tremor reduction with alcohol ingestion. Pharmacologic responsiveness is different for these disorders. Propranolol and primidone often have beneficial effects but clonazepam was the only drug effective in some cases of kinetic predominant tremor and in orthostatic truncal tremor. Combined resting-postural tremor and voice tremor were often unresponsive to treatment.", 
    "1": "Several previous investigations have shown that blebs form on the apical surface of the striated duct cells of the rat submandibular gland on feeding after starvation. In the present report the influence of autonomic nerve stimulation on bleb formation was studied by electron microscopy. Both parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation were performed, using electric nerve stimulation. In addition, sympathetic nerve stimulation in combination with alpha- or beta-adrenergic blockers was used. Massive bleb formation took place in response to sympathetic nerve stimulation. This response was almost completely abolished by the administration of alpha- but not by beta-adrenergic blocker. Bleb formation was not seen after parasympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "2": "An infant of a diabetic mother is described with severe neonatal hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Commencement of regular intravenous propranolol was associated with marked clinical improvement. Long-term oral propranolol was continued and at 12 months of age there was complete resolution of the cardiomyopathy. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy hypertrophy was present in two other generations of this family. The results of family screening and tissue typing are presented, with the suggestion that tissue typing may be a useful tool in the assessment of doubtful cases in certain affected families.", 
    "3": "The principal results of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Hypertension Trial were published in mid-1985 and additional papers are in preparation which will give more detailed information about important issues such as the influence of treatment upon ischaemic heart disease. This paper briefly reviews some points about the trial. The main results of the MRC trial were that stroke was reduced on average by about half (69% with bendrofluazide, 27% with propranolol); coronary events, although not reduced across the board, were reduced by one-third in male non-smokers treated with propranolol; and compared with placebo, all-cause mortality in the actively treated groups was lower in men but higher in women. The implications of these results are discussed. It is hoped that the MRC trial will open the way to a more intelligently targeted approach that may help to reduce the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction by skillful selection of patients and drugs. By this selection, many patients who are at very low risk or for whom the risks of treatment may outweight the likely benefits will be spared the cost and inconvenience of prolonged treatment.", 
    "4": "While long term beta-adrenergic blockade, introduced in the convalescent stage of myocardial infarction, may reduce subsequent mortality, the value of early beta-blockade in the acute phase is less certain. Therefore, the influence of beta-blockade on left ventricular performance and eventual infarct size was assessed in 61 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. Metoprolol (15 mg i.v. followed by 200 mg day-1 orally) or placebo was administered in a double-blind, randomised fashion with a median delay of 5.9 hours from onset of symptoms. After 15 days of double blind therapy all patients were started on open treatment with metoprolol. All patients underwent haemodynamic monitoring for 24 hours and serial radionuclide ventriculography and thallium 201 scintigraphy. In the first hour metoprolol produced a decrease in cardiac output (1.3 l min-1; P less than 0.001) due to a reduction in heart rate (15 min-1; P less than 0.001) and a decrease in left ventricular stroke work index (10.7 g m m-2; P less than 0.001) due to a reduction in mean arterial pressure (10 mmHg; P less than 0.001). There was then a gradual attenuation in these changes. While metoprolol produced an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and in both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (P less than 0.05), these changes were confined to patients with a baseline pulmonary capillary wedge pressure below the median of 13 mmHg mercury. There was no significant change in stroke volume or in ejection fraction in response to metoprolol. There was no significant difference between the groups in left ventricular performance, as assessed by radionuclide ventriculography, or in scintigraphic infarct size, either at the end of the 15 days double-blind treatment or after 3 months open treatment with metoprolol. Thus, early intervention with metoprolol in acute myocardial infarction appeared to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption with no adverse haemodynamic effect. However, metoprolol failed to preserve left ventricular function, or to reduce apparent infarct size. These data suggest that the modest reduction in mortality reported in the acute phase studies of beta-blockade in myocardial infarction, is unlikely to be due to infarct reduction. It is more likely to be due to a secondary prevention or to an antiarrhythmic effect.", 
    "5": "1 Twelve non-diabetic hypertensive male patients insufficiently controlled by a diuretic were included in a double-blind, randomised study. In addition placebo or felodipine was given for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week wash-out period, after which the alternative treatment was given for another 4 weeks. At the end of each treatment period an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and blood pressure, plasma noradrenaline and felodipine levels were measured. 2 There was no change in either glucose, insulin or glucagon levels during the OGTT after felodipine compared with placebo. Blood pressure was significantly reduced during the dosage interval of felodipine (12 h). Plasma noradrenaline increased significantly after felodipine. Side effects were few. 3 In a separate open study 58 hypertensive patients were treated with felodipine in addition to a diuretic and a beta-adrenoceptor blocker for up to 1 year. There were no significant changes in fasting blood glucose levels during the study.", 
    "6": "This placebo-controlled, double-blind trial compared the hemodynamic effects of sotalol and quinidine with the use of rest and exercise gated radionuclide angiography. Patients had frequent ventricular premature depolarizations (greater than or equal to 30 VPDs/hour) and depressed cardiac function (mean ejection fraction 43 +/- 15%). Resting left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume index increased (p less than .002, p less than .001, respectively) during sotalol therapy, associated with a concomitant fall in heart rate (p less than .001). Quinidine also increased mean left ventricular ejection fraction, but less so than did sotalol (p less than .05). Quinidine significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic (p less than .05) and end-systolic (p less than .002) volumes, but had no effect on stroke volume index or heart rate. Neither drug affected cardiac index. Quinidine resulted in no symptomatic deterioration in left ventricular function or serious arrhythmia aggravation. In contrast, five patients on sotalol developed either decompensated congestive heart failure (two patients), arrhythmia aggravation (two patients), or hypotension associated with bradyarrhythmia (one patient). These patients had a unique hemodynamic profile that can be used to identify patients likely to have a poor outcome on sotalol. This profile reflected a lack of cardiac reserve, characterized by an inability to increase stroke volume and cardiac output with supine bicycle exercise.", 
    "7": "We compared the safety and efficacy of diltiazem and propranolol, and examined demographic factors influencing responses to these agents. One hundred ninety-six patients with supine diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 114 mm Hg were treated with propranolol (80 to 240 mg twice a day) or a sustained-release preparation of diltiazem (60 to 180 mg twice a day) in a double-blind, randomized, parallel group protocol for 6 months. Hydrochlorothiazide was added for patients not achieving the treatment goal. Both agents produced nearly identical and highly significant (p less than 0.001) reductions in supine blood pressure. There were no significant differences at the end of the optional combination therapy phase, although additional reduction with hydrochlorothiazide was slightly greater in the propranolol group. Blood pressure responses in relation to age, gender, race, and smoking history showed that diltiazem produced greater changes in older subjects and women, whereas propranolol was less effective in blacks. However, these differences were not critical.", 
    "8": "Betaxolol, a beta 1-selective adrenergic antagonist, and nadolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist are both potent long-acting antihypertensive drugs. The effects of betaxolol on renal function have not been reported. The effects of nadolol on renal function are controversial. The current randomized double-blind study was designed to compare the effects of betaxolol and nadolol on glomerular filtration rate, assessed by creatinine and inulin clearances, and renal hemodynamics, assessed by p-aminohippurate clearance. Following a 4-week placebo run-in period, 15 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to a mean dose of 22 mg betaxolol for 12 weeks, and 12 patients with essential hypertension were randomized to a mean dose of 103 mg nadolol for 12 weeks. Results indicate that neither drug produced a clinically relevant effect on renal function. These findings are consistent with previously reported observations with other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. We conclude that neither of the beta-adrenergic antagonists, betaxolol or nadolol, convey a specific renal pharmacologic advantage; both are equally efficacious and safe in the treatment of mild-to-moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "9": "Insulin, at a concentration of 1 mU/ml, stimulated glycogen synthase and pyruvate dehydrogenase about threefold in isolated rat adipocytes. Upon the removal of insulin, glycogen synthase activity remained in the activated state for 10 min and thereafter rapidly returned to basal level. On the other hand, insulin-stimulated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity remained elevated for at least 30 min. Isoproterenol (10(-8) M) stimulated phosphorylase and inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase through the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors. Addition of the beta-antagonist, propranolol (10(-5) M), after isoproterenol reversed the action of isoproterenol on phosphorylase but not its action on pyruvate dehydrogenase. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, when added to intact adipocytes, produced an effect on pyruvate dehydrogenase similar to that induced by isoproterenol. Our results indicate that both insulin and the beta-agonist have a unique action on pyruvate dehydrogenase which is different from their effects on other enzymes such as glycogen synthase and phosphorylase.", 
    "10": "Vasomotility of normal and stenosed coronary arteries was studied at rest and during supine bicycle exercise in 10 patients with classical exercise-induced angina pectoris receiving 1 mg intracoronary propranolol before the exercise test (propranolol group). Normal and stenotic coronary lumen areas were determined from biplane coronary arteriograms using a computer-assisted system. Measurements were performed at rest, after 1 mg intracoronary propranolol, during supine exercise (89 W for 3.4 minutes) and 5 minutes after 1.6 mg sublingual nitroglycerin administered at the end of the exercise test. The results were compared with previously obtained data on the effect of dynamic exercise on coronary lumen area in 12 patients receiving no medication (control group) and in 6 patients receiving 0.1 mg intracoronary nitroglycerin before the exercise test (nitroglycerin group). In the control group, coronary stenosis area decreased during exercise to 71% of levels at rest (p less than 0.001) whereas normal coronary lumen area increased to 123% of control (p less than 0.01). In the propranolol group both normal (113%, p less than 0.05 versus rest) and stenotic coronary lumen area (122%, p less than 0.05 versus rest) increased during exercise. A similar increase in both normal and stenotic areas was observed during exercise after pretreatment with 0.1 mg intracoronary nitroglycerin (123%, p less than 0.01 and 114%, p = NS versus rest). Sublingual administration of 1.6 mg nitroglycerin at the end of exercise increased coronary stenosis area to 145% (p less than 0.01 versus rest) in the propranolol group and to 115% in the control group (p = NS versus rest). It is concluded that intracoronary administration of propranolol does not potentiate coronary vasoconstriction of the epicardial vessels at rest and during exercise. In contrast, intracoronary propranolol prevents exercise-induced stenosis narrowing either because of reduced myocardial oxygen demand with a lower coronary blood flow resulting in a smaller transstenotic pressure gradient and, thus, a smaller flow-induced fall in stenosis distending pressure; or because of \"local\" beta-receptor blockade with unopposed distal arteriolar alpha-receptor tone, resulting in a higher poststenotic pressure and, thus, in a greater stenosis distending pressure; or because of a local anesthetic effect of propranolol with a decrease in calcium influx to the coronary smooth musculature.", 
    "11": "The gene encoding the hamster beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) was expressed in mouse C6 glioma cells, a cell line which normally expressed the beta 1 subtype of the receptor. Upon transfection with the hamster beta AR gene, the cells expressed increased levels of beta AR, as assessed both by protein immunoblotting and by the binding of the radiolabeled antagonist 125I-cyanopindolol. This newly expressed receptor was of the beta 2 subtype, as determined with a variety of agonists and antagonists. These results suggest that the subtype of the beta AR is an intrinsic property of the gene product and is not the result of a post-translational modification of the receptor by the cell in which it is expressed.", 
    "12": "Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured in 32 untreated subjects with essential hypertension and in 31 patients undergoing long-term treatment with beta-blockers. Patients receiving beta-blockers had significantly higher mean plasma ANP levels (72.0 +/- 36.0 [SD] pg/ml) than did untreated hypertensive subjects (39.8 +/- 15.8 pg/ml; p less than 0.01) and healthy normotensive controls (33.9 +/- 16.6 pg/ml; n = 61, p less than 0.01), while the mean plasma ANP concentration in untreated hypertensive subjects was not statistically different from that in control subjects. Administration of atenolol, 50 mg/day, for 4 weeks to 10 untreated subjects resulted in a significant (p less than 0.001) rise in plasma ANP levels (from 38.8 +/- 9.5 to 68.7 +/- 20.6 pg/ml). In 31 patients undergoing long-term treatment with beta-blockers, multivariate regression analysis revealed that age, pretreatment mean blood pressure, and plasma concentration of cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) were significant predictors of plasma ANP levels. These results suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in patients with essential hypertension elevates plasma ANP levels with a concomitant rise in cGMP concentrations, and that increased ANP in plasma may play a role in the compensatory mechanism that operates in response to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade.", 
    "13": "Beta-adrenergic receptors in human peripheral lung were characterized by biochemical and radioligand assays employing binding of the beta-antagonist (-)[125I]pindolol to plasma membrane preparations. The specific binding of (-)[125I]pindolol reached equilibrium by 45 min with an initial rate constant of 0.0282 min-1. Binding was reversible with a kinetic dissociation rate constant of 0.0146 min-1. The calculated kinetic Kd (dissociation constant) was 430 pM which agreed very well with the Kd of 394 pM obtained by Scatchard analyses of equilibrium binding data. Computer analyses of equilibrium binding experiments revealed a similar Kd of 336 +/- 24 pM. The binding capacities calculated by computer analyses (155 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein) and Scatchard analyses (113 fmol/mg protein) were also in close agreement. By all three methods (kinetic, Scatchard, and computer analyses), the data were most compatible with a single (-)[125I]pindolol binding site. Analyses of equilibrium binding data from ten different human lungs revealed values for the Kd ranging from 79 to 360 pM (mean, 136 pM), and for the receptor concentration ranging from 58 to 196 fmol/mg protein (mean, 118 fmol/mg protein). The displacement of (-)[125I]pindolol binding by various agents exhibited stereoselectivity and the expected rank order of potency predicted for interactions with beta-receptors. Isoproterenol induced a rapid and dose-related increase in cyclic AMP that was prevented by specific beta-antagonists. Approximately 70% of the beta-receptors were found to be of the beta 2-subtype by both radioligand binding and biochemical assays. Thus, (-)[125I]pindolol appears to be an excellent ligand for characterizing human lung beta-receptors since accurate and reproducible results can be obtained with this radioligand using limited tissue sample quantities.", 
    "14": "Pulmonary uptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), zimeldine and propranolol were studied using the isolated perfused rat lung model. The 5-HT uptake was found to be attenuated by approximately 50 per cent in comparison to the control, when the lungs were ventilated with air containing 5,000 p.p.m. trichloroethylene. In experiments in which the active uptake of 5-HT was blocked with the selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor zimeldine (5 X 10(-6) M), the uptake of 5-HT decreased by 70 +/- 1.7 per cent (mean +/- S.E.M.). When trichloroethylene (5,000 p.p.m. and 18,000 p.p.m.) was added, no further decrease in uptake was noted. The uptake of 3H-zimeldine (10(-6) M) and 3H-propranolol (10(-6) M) was unaffected by ventilating the lungs with trichloroethylene. It is concluded that trichloroethylene inhibits the active uptake of 5-HT from the pulmonary circulation, but that it has no effect on the uptake of zimeldine or propranolol, which are taken up predominantly by passive diffusion.", 
    "15": "Slices of hippocampus from the rabbit were preincubated with [3H]5-HT), then superfused continuously and twice stimulated electrically. The stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium was inhibited by the 5-HT autoreceptor ligands 5-carboxamido-tryptamine (5-COHT), 5-HT, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (5-MeOMT), (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), methysergide and (+/-)-cyanopindolol in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were competitively inhibited by the 5-HT autoreceptor antagonists, metitepin and metergoline. (+/-)-Cyanopindolol also reduced the evoked release of 5-HT from slices of cortex from the rat. The inhibitor of the uptake of 5-HT, 6-nitroquipazine diminished the autoreceptor-mediated depression of release of 5-HT. In cortex tissue from the rat, 6-nitroquipazine reversed the decreased release of 5-HT, due to (+/-)-cyanopindolol, to a facilitation. The disinhibition of the release of 5-HT by autoreceptor antagonists was further enhanced by 6-nitroquipazine. Non-linear regression analysis of concentration-response curves for 5-COHT yielded the following pKd of endogenous 5-HT at the autoreceptor: 7.753 +/- 0.116. This value corresponds to the pKd of 5-HT at the 5-HT1B binding site. The 5-HT biophase concentration at the autoreceptor of 10(-8.220 +/- 0.132)M was markedly enhanced by 6-nitroquipazine (10(-6)M) to 10(-7.476 +/- 0.132)M. It is concluded that the 5-HT autoreceptor belongs to the 5-HT1B subtype of receptor; the corresponding 5-HT biophase concentration can be estimated quantitatively; 8-OH-DPAT decreased the evoked release of 5-HT through both 5-HT autoreceptors and alpha 2-heteroreceptors and (+/-)-cyanopindolol acts as partial agonist at the 5-HT autoreceptor.", 
    "16": "Using a noninvasive passive flow volume technique to measure respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs), the effects of two inhaled bronchodilators, salbutamol (beta 2-agonist) and ipratropium bromide (muscarinic blocker), were studied in 17 premature infants ranging in age from 19 to 103 days. All were ventilator dependent with chronic lung disease. The pretreatment Rrs was high (range 0.15 to 0.27 cm H2O X ml-1 X sec). After administration of salbutamol, the mean group Rrs decreased 24% +/- 11% (mean +/- SD), and Crs increased significantly, 17% +/- 21%. The response to ipratropium bromide in five infants did not differ significantly from their responses to salbutamol. Nebulized saline solution had no bronchodilator effect in five infants. These results suggest that in infants with early and late chronic lung disease, bronchospasm can be partially alleviated by inhaled bronchodilators.", 
    "17": "Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy occurs with a number of antihypertensive drugs, but the time course of this regression has not been defined clearly. We obtained echocardiograms at baseline and serially (on seven occasions) during a 1 year treatment period with the beta-adrenergic receptor inhibitor atenolol in 12 patients with previously untreated essential hypertension. To ensure control of blood pressure in all patients throughout the study, it was necessary to add a thiazide diuretic to the therapy of five patients. Baseline blood pressure was 155/100 mm Hg and fell to 136/84 mm Hg; there was a 20% reduction in heart rate. Posterior and septal wall thicknesses were reduced from 1.16 +/- 0.03 to 1.06 +/- 0.02 cm (p less than .05) and from 1.28 +/- 0.07 to 1.18 +/- 0.06 cm (p less than .05), respectively; this reduction became significant initially at 4 weeks. Left ventricular mass decreased from 144 +/- 9 to 127 +/- 7 g/m2 (p less than .05) and this fall first became statistically significant at 6 months. Significant reduction in electrocardiographic voltages was also seen at 6 months. Therefore, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with atenolol-induced blood pressure control occurred as early as 4 weeks after starting therapy and was maintained thereafter without apparent compromise of left ventricular systolic function.", 
    "18": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether adenosine or the adenosine deaminase-resistant analogue, N6-R-1-phenyl-2-propyladenosine (RPIA), could slow the rate of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia occurring 24 hours after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Chloralose-anesthetized, open chest dogs (n = 25) with ventricular tachycardia were studied. The left anterior descending artery was cannulated distally. Intracoronary infusions of adenosine, 10(-7) to 10(-5) M, did not alter the rate of ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia slowed by 4.6% with adenosine, 10(-4) M. RPIA, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the rate of ventricular tachycardia when injected into the left anterior descending coronary artery. This effect of RPIA was reversed by the adenosine antagonist aminophylline, 10(-5) M. After bilateral stellate ganglionectomy, RPIA, 10(-5) M, did not, but metoprolol, 0.5 mg, did slow ventricular tachycardia after intracoronary injection. However, RPIA, 10(-5) M, produced a 43% decrease in the increment in ventricular tachycardia occurring during sympathetic neural stimulation. Therefore, when injected into the left anterior descending artery, adenosine, 10(-4) M, and RPIA, 10(-6) to 10(-4) M, decrease the rate of ventricular tachycardia in 24 hour old myocardial infarction. Furthermore, this decrease in the rate of ventricular tachycardia is the result of prejunctional sympathetic antagonism.", 
    "19": "Following the recent demonstration that both cholestyramine and nicotinic acid decrease mortality from coronary heart disease, there is a new enthusiasm for hypolipidaemic therapy. The agents in current use are, however, insufficiently active or are accompanied by unacceptable side effects. An understanding of the mode of action is necessary, both to optimize treatment guidelines (e.g. regarding combination therapy or use in specific subsets of patients) and to develop new agents with preferred actions on rate-limiting steps. A reduction in LDL cholesterol concentration remains the principal desired action, although an elevation in HDL may also be beneficial. The main categories of commercially available agent comprise the anion exchange resins (inhibitors of bile acid absorption); cholesterol absorption inhibitors; fibrates (probably acting by enhancing lipoprotein lipase); and probucol (affecting LDL clearance). The most interesting of the new agents in clinical trials are the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, but other types of agent are at an earlier stage of evaluation, e.g. acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors and peptide cofactors. It is not yet certain whether all the approaches to cholesterol lowering have equal validity, although an effect on biological endpoints is obtained for a variety of agents. Future evaluation will be aided by the implementation of noninvasive methods to quantify atherosclerosis and by the use of simple, 'dry-chemistry', cholesterol assays to screen populations.", 
    "20": "Nylidrin (buphenine) is a beta-adrenergic agonist known to dilate peripheral vessels and used therapeutically in retinal degeneration and glaucoma. We studied retinal function under beta-agonists in arterially perfused cat eyes and observed a dose-dependent, reversible increase in b-wave amplitude and a decrease in c-wave amplitude in concentrations from 4.5 to 120 microM. A half maximal response was obtained at 40 to 50 microM. The optic nerve response to light showed dose-dependent reversible changes under nylidrin. Standing potential, light peak, intraocular pressure, vascular resistance, and diameter of or retinal vessels showed no consistent changes under nylidrin. The effect were inhibited by each of the beta-blocking agents propranolol, ICI 118, and oxprenolol (in sequence of decreasing potency). Another potent beta 2-agonist, clenbuterol, was used to determine the extent to which the responses to nylidrin were due to beta-receptor-mediated action. Clenbuterol had similar effects on the b-wave and optic nerve response at slightly higher concentrations (30 200 microM) but more variable effects on the c-wave. The data are interpreted as functional evidence that beta-adrenergic mechanisms are involved in retinal signal processing. This concept is corroborated by identification of beta-adrenergic binding sites in cat retina (Bruinink et al., 1986).", 
    "21": "The biochemical aspects of hepatic beta-adrenergic receptors and adenylate cyclase activity in male adult rats were examined during chronic treatment of a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. The blockade of beta-adrenergic nervous systems for 7 to 10 days produced a considerable elevation of basal, glucagon, sodium fluoride, and 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, Gpp (NH)p-stimulated enzyme activity with a negligible response to a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. There was no alteration in the density or the affinity of beta-adrenergic receptors for the agonist during the treatment. Guanine nucleotides have failed to induce a transformation of the higher affinity to the lower affinity state of beta-adrenergic receptors of the hepatic membrane derived either from control or the propranolol-treated animals. The activity of stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (Ns) in the enzyme, assessed by ADP-ribosylation was also not altered by the antagonist. These results suggest that the mechanism of the observed sensitization of adenylate cyclase induced by chronic beta-adrenergic blockade involves facilitation of Ns interaction with the catalytic subunit of the enzyme with no change in the beta-adrenergic receptor functions.", 
    "22": "To determine the antiarrhythmic efficacy of beta-blockers (beta-B) and verapamil (V) in exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia (Ex-VT), nine patients with reproducible Ex-VT (in two consecutive exercise tests) were studied by means of electrophysiologic study (EPS) in basal conditions and serial exercise testing after beta-B (metoprolol 25 mg tid to 100 mg qid; oxprenolol 40 mg tid) and/or V (80-160 mg tid). Ejection fraction was normal in four cases and depressed in five. Of these nine patients, four developed Ex-VT during chronic amiodarone treatment, which was continued. During EPS, VT was induced at a critical atrial pacing rate in one case, and with the extrastimulus technique in four. Ventricular tachycardia was not inducible with either technique in four patients. Five of the six patients on beta-B and none of the seven on V developed Ex-VT, although they achieved the same or higher work-loads as compared to the basal exercise tests. In the case with rate-dependent VT, beta-B and V prevented VT at work-loads, sinus rates and double products significantly higher than those obtained in basal conditions. In the others, maximal heart rate and double product were lower on beta-B and showed a wide variability on V. V and beta-B appeared to be highly effective in preventing Ex-VT, in patients with normal heart as well as in those with greatly depressed ejection fraction. Both of the drugs appeared to suppress re-entry or triggered activity in the patient with rate-dependent Ex-VT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "QT-interval prolongation is a recognized risk indicator for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The effect of beta-blockers on the change of the QT-interval relative to the change in heart rate was studied in 269 male patients who underwent computer-interpreted exercise tests. None of the patients studied used anti-arrhythmic drugs, diuretics or digoxin. In 141 men on beta-blockers the relation between Q-peakT interval and heart rate could be described as follows: Q-peakT = -1.48 X heart rate + 415. In 128 patients not on beta-blockers this relation was: Q-peakT = -1.14 X heart rate + 379. The difference of the slopes is 0.34 (0.22 - 0.46, 95% confidence interval). This difference was even more pronounced in a subgroup of coronary patients: 0.44 (0.30 - 0.57, 95% confidence interval). These results indicate that in men using beta-blockers the QT-interval shortens faster with increasing heart rate than in men not using them. At high heart rates patients on beta-blockers have a shorter QT-interval than those not using them. These observations could explain the beneficial effect of beta-blockers on exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in coronary patients.", 
    "24": "The effect of cimetidine on the new beta-blocker betaxolol (Kerlone) was investigated in 7 healthy volunteers. Propranolol was used as a reference beta-blocking drug. In the control study, a single oral dose of propranolol (80 mg) was given (D0) followed by 5 daily doses of cimetidine (1 g) (D1-D6) and a second oral dose of propranolol (D7). The study was repeated with 20 mg of betaxolol replacing the propranolol dose. The oral clearance of propranolol was significantly decreased (21%). No significant effect of cimetidine on the kinetics of betaxolol was observed.", 
    "25": "Lidamidine, a new antidiarrheal agent, produced a dose-dependent increase in plasma glucose levels in fed rats. The hyperglycemic response was evident 10 min after oral administration of lidamidine and lasted for 4 hr. Lidamidine's effect was absent in alloxanized rats. Insulin administration prevented the hyperglycemia. Pretreatment with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine or RX781094A blocked the hyperglycemic response, while prazosin, propranolol, and hexamethonium pretreatment had no effect. These results indicate that the hyperglycemic effect of lidamidine is primarily due to the activation of peripherally located alpha 2-adrenoceptors that inhibit the release of insulin from pancreatic beta-cells.", 
    "26": "Following the early and important observations more than two decades ago, by Prichard and Gillam that beta-blockers had a useful antihypertensive effect, this class of compounds has become widely accepted in the treatment of elevated arterial pressure. Today there are numerous different compounds available within the beta-blocker class, with marked differences in their ancillary properties. Undoubtedly, the blockade of beta 1-adrenoceptors is the effect needed to achieve the reduction in blood pressure, and this selectivity also offers some advantages from a safety point of view. However, in some circumstances, ancillary properties such as beta 2-blockade may offer advantages, as can intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The fact that beta-blockers have become first-line treatment for hypertension in many countries and that memoranda produced by the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension jointly advocate beta-blockers as one alternative for basic therapy reflects the positive balance between efficacy and side effects seen with these agents. It is also an indication that positive long-term clinical experience has been accumulated with beta-blockers. Finally, secondary prevention against coronary heart disease is well documented for beta-blockers. For this reason there have been great hopes for many years that beta-blockers would also have a primary preventive effect against coronary heart disease when used in the treatment of hypertension. Indications are now accumulating that, at least in some subgroups of patients, beta-blockers may have such an effect. Thus, although newer classes of compounds appear to be extremely competitive, beta-blockers are likely to play an important role in the treatment of hypertension for many years to come.", 
    "27": "Hypertensive diseases of pregnancy are clinically important because they can adversely influence the health and life of both mother and baby. Hypertensive disease is the commonest cause of maternal mortality in England and Wales, accounting for 20.4% of maternal deaths. It is depressing to note that most, if not all, of these deaths are preventable. Three broadly different kinds of hypertension can be identified as potential complications of pregnancy: chronic hypertension, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and pre-eclampsia. Where chronic hypertension is treated with methyldopa and PIH is treated with atenolol, there is evidence that therapy is beneficial in terms of immediate pregnancy outcome and is not harmful to the child. Atenolol is currently being evaluated in combination with nifedipine to treat cases of early onset of severe pre-eclampsia, and preliminary results are encouraging. Prevention rather than cure should be the aim in managing hypertensive diseases during pregnancy. Early intervention can prevent serious problems later on.", 
    "28": "In mild to moderate hypertension the benefit:risk ratio of treatment cannot be predicted for an individual patient. Antihypertensive drug therapy can therefore only be justified if the patient's quality of life remains unimpaired. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are considered to improve the 'quality of life'. However, only two trials have assessed the influence of antihypertensive drugs on 'quality of life', and it is interesting that both used captopril as a comparative drug. Although both studies differed in their 'quality-of-life' definitions and in their assessment methods, in the overall analysis of change, both favoured captopril. There are no published trials comparing the effects of enalapril with other antihypertensive agents on major aspects of quality of life. Our own results show that enalapril and atenolol are equivalent, both in terms of antihypertensive efficacy and incidence of side effects.", 
    "29": "A review of published studies was undertaken to assess the efficacy and patient tolerability of calcium antagonists compared with established antihypertensive therapy, i.e. beta-blockers and diuretics. Randomized controlled trials undertaken in Caucasian patients with mild to moderate hypertension were evaluated. Only 12 trials fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review and they differed considerably with regard to design, method of analysis, and drug and dose regimen used; a formal pooled analysis of the data was not feasible. Few trials demonstrated significant differences in blood pressure control between treatments. Side effects were rarely seen, or were not assessed, and the number of patients studied was relatively small. Two large unpublished trials have recently evaluated the slow-release twice-daily formulation of 20 mg nifedipine, 50 mg atenolol and the fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol + 20 mg nifedipine, using a randomized double-blind crossover design. Mean blood pressure with atenolol was consistently lower than with nifedipine although this achieved statistical significance in only one study (P less than 0.01). Fixed combination therapy gave a greater antihypertensive effect than either atenolol or nifedipine administered alone (P less than 0.05 to P less than 0.001). Side effects were most common with nifedipine treatment, less common with combination therapy and occurred least commonly with atenolol alone (P less than 0.001). In one study involving 44 patients (aged 20-70 years), side effects attributable to peripheral vasodilation secondary to nifedipine therapy, e.g. flushing and sweats, were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) with nifedipine (n = 11) than with atenolol (n = 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "1 In the circular muscle of the corpus region of the guinea-pig stomach, the effects of catecholamines on mechanical activity were studied with simultaneous recording of membrane potential by use of intracellular microelectrodes. In order to investigate responses mediated through alpha-adrenoceptors, the beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by propranolol (10(-6) M) in most experiments. 2 Adrenaline (less than 10(-6) M) produced a monophasic contraction with little change in membrane potential. At higher concentrations (greater than 10(-5) M), adrenaline usually produced an early transient contraction followed by a slow tonic contraction. During the early phase, the membrane was hyperpolarized and slow waves were reduced in amplitude. 3 The phasic contractions superimposed on the late slow phase of the contractile response were higher in frequency and larger in amplitude than in controls before adrenaline application. These changes were associated with an increase in the amplitude and frequency of slow waves, and with a spike-like component appearing on the top of each slow wave. 4 Adrenaline-induced changes in mechanical and electrical activity were inhibited by prazosin, but largely unaffected by yohimbine. In some preparations, there was a transient weak inhibition of phasic contraction before muscle tone was increased by adrenaline, and this became more pronounced in the presence of yohimbine. 5 Phenylephrine, selective for alpha 1-receptors, produced responses very similar to those of adrenaline, whereas agonists selective for alpha 2-receptors, clonidine and B-HT 920, produced only a small slow contraction without any clear change in membrane potential. 6 It is concluded that in the circular muscle of guinea-pig stomach, the contractile response and changes in the electrical slow wave activity produced by adrenaline are both mediated mainly through the activation of alpha-receptors.", 
    "31": "The effect of intranasal nitroglycerine on the pressor response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation was studied in 40 adult hypertensive patients treated with beta-blocking drugs. Nitroglycerine 0.75 mg, administered intranasally 30 seconds before induction of anaesthesia, was compared with a placebo solution of saline. Haemodynamic variables were measured for 10 minutes after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Heart rate did not change significantly in either group. Systolic as well as mean arterial blood pressure increased significantly for the first 5 minutes in the control group, whereas patients in the nitroglycerine group showed a decrease in systolic as well as in mean arterial pressure. No patient in the nitroglycerine group showed a decrease in systolic arterial pressure greater than 20 mmHg. In conclusion, intranasal nitroglycerine ameliorates the pressor response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in beta-blocked patients.", 
    "32": "The emetic action of noradrenaline was investigated in unanesthetized cats, after it was injected into the cerebral ventricles through chronically implanted cannulae. Intracerebroventricular injection of noradrenaline produced dose-dependent and shortlasting emesis, which was abolished after ablation of the area postrema. However, copper sulphate, given orally, evoked emesis in cats with an ablated area postrema. The selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, as well as the mixed alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocking drugs, phentolamine, tolazoline, phenoxybenzamine and dihydroergotamine, but not the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, all injected into the cerebral ventricles, attenuated or blocked the emesis evoked by intracerebroventricular injection of noradrenaline. Of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, only yohimbine produced dose-dependent inhibition of the emesis induced by noradrenaline. On the contrary, selected beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, an antimuscarinic drug, a ganglionic blocking agent, an antihistamine, dopamine antagonists and a 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonist, all injected into the cerebral ventricles, had no significant effect on the emesis induced by noradrenaline, similarly injected. The emetic response to intracerebroventricular injection of noradrenaline, as well as to intragastric administration of copper sulphate was not altered in cats pretreated with intracerebroventricular injections of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine and bretylium. On the other hand, the emetic response to intracerebroventricular injection of noradrenaline and to intragastric administration of copper sulphate was attentuated or blocked in cats pretreated with reserpine intracerebroventricularly. Moreover, in cats pretreated with intracerebroventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine and hemicholinium, the emesis induced by intracerebroventricular administration of noradrenaline but not that produced by intragastric injection of copper sulphate, was depressed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "33": "The interaction of the enantiomers of mianserin and propranolol with the binding of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) to the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C sites, and with the binding of [3H]ketanserin to the 5-HT2 site, has been evaluated in rat brain membranes. A stereoselective interaction at the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C sites was demonstrated for both compounds, with (+)-mianserin being a more potent displacer than (-)-mianserin and (-)-propranolol being more potent than (+)-propranolol. Only mianserin interacted in a stereoselective manner with the 5-HT2 site, (+)-mianserin being the more potent isomer. The stereoselective association of mianserin and propranolol with the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C sites may prove useful in the characterization of these sites.", 
    "34": "The receptor pharmacology of the cardiovascular effects of dopexamine hydrochloride in the anaesthetized dog (given by i.v. infusion of 3 X 10(-9)-10(-7) mol kg-1 min-1) has been analysed by the use of selective receptor antagonists and of ganglionic blockade. The increases in cardiac output, contractility, and rate were antagonized by the beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551. Renal blood flow rose secondary to reduction in renal vascular resistance and this was antagonized by SCH 23390, a highly selective DA1-receptor antagonist. Peripheral vasodilation and reduction of blood pressure were mediated by a combination of DA1- and DA2-receptor and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. In a separate group of dogs, the cardiac stimulant effects of dopexamine HCl were partially reflex and were reduced by ganglion block, revealing responses due to stimulation of cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptors. Thus the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist action of dopexamine HCl is not only partly responsible for afterload reduction but also leads to direct cardiac stimulation. From its cardiovascular profile, dopexamine HCl is likely to be of use in acute treatment of heart failure.", 
    "35": "The effect of nadolol at a dose of 1 mg kg-1, i.v. on the ischaemic myocardial metabolism has been examined in the dog. Ischaemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 3 min, and nadolol was injected 5 min before ligation. Ischaemia caused myocardial metabolic changes; it decreased energy charge potential and inhibited glycolytic flux through phosphofructokinase reaction. Pretreatment with nadolol lessened the decrease in energy charge potential and the inhibition of glycolytic flux being caused by ischaemia. Nadolol may have a beneficial effect on the ischaemic myocardium.", 
    "36": "Indocyanine green (ICG) and (+)-propranolol kinetics were determined in the rat following moderate (50%) blood exchange with either Fluosol-DA or 0.9% NaCl (saline). Rats received an intravenous ICG dose (5 mg kg-1) before an intravenous dose of (+)-propranolol (2.5 mg kg-1) 0.5, 24, 48 or 72 h after haemodilution and were compared with non-exchanged controls. Haemodilution with Fluosol-DA reduced the ICG elimination rate constant during the first 24 h while a significant reduction was seen 48 h after normal saline exchange. ICG clearances tended to be less than the control value, and were significantly reduced only at 24 h after Fluosol-DA exchange due to a reduced Varea. (+)-Propranolol half-life was significantly increased 48 and 72 h after saline exchange; (+)-propranolol clearance was also significantly reduced 72 h after Fluosol-DA exchange. ICG clearance may be reflecting a hypovolaemic change which occurs after haemodilution, which would reduce the hepatic blood flow. However, (+)-propranolol clearance was not altered, suggesting that the hepatic blood flow is not changed. It is possible that ICG clearance is changed due to alterations in its extraction ratio instead of hepatic blood flow changes.", 
    "37": "Intraventricular infusions of adrenaline and various pharmacological agents acting on beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes were carried out in rats orchidectomized 16 h previously. Infusions (10 microliter) of solutions containing the drugs were administered under anaesthesia induced with alphaxalone and alphadolone. Levels of LH were measured in plasma collected immediately before and at predetermined intervals after the infusion. The acute rise in LH levels after castration was increased still further by isoprenaline (a mixed beta 1- and beta 2-agonist), fenoterol (a beta 2-agonist) and atenolol (a beta 1-antagonist). In contrast, prenalterol (a beta 1-agonist) and (2RS,3RS)-3-isopropylamino-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloxy)++ +butan-2-ol (ICI 118,551) (a selective beta 2-antagonist) were inhibitory to LH release. Adrenaline itself, salbutamol (another selective beta 2-agonist), propranolol (a mixed beta-antagonist) and metoprolol (a beta 1-antagonist) did not significantly alter plasma LH concentrations at the doses administered. The stimulatory effect of isoprenaline on LH release was partially reduced when given together with ICI 118,551, but was not affected when administered simultaneously with atenolol. The inhibitory effect of ICI 118,551 was, however, prevented by concomitant administration with fenoterol, as was that of prenalterol when infused with atenolol. The results suggest that the hypothalamic mediation of the short-term changes in LH release in response to castration is exerted, at least in part, through the activation of a beta 2-stimulatory component and the suppression of a beta 1-inhibitory component.", 
    "38": "Nizatidine is an orally active H2-receptor blocker. Its disposition and safety in eight young and 12 elderly volunteers were investigated. Single oral doses of nizatidine were administered: from 100 mg to 300 mg in the elderly, and from 100 mg to 350 mg in the young. The nizatidine AUC was directly proportional to dose for both groups. Calculated pharmacokinetic variables in the elderly vs. the young were t1/2 = 1.9 vs. 1.6 hr; CLp/f = 32 vs. 40 L/hr, and Vd beta/f = 1.2 vs. 1.3 L/kg. The impaired renal function of some elderly volunteers prolonged nizatidine elimination and lowered its clearance. Renal impairment rather than advanced age per se was the predominant factor in decreasing the nizatidine elimination rate. Because Clcr correlated directly with nizatidine renal clearance, Clcr values may be used to estimate nizatidine dosage reductions in renal insufficiency. During the trial, no serious adverse effects occurred.", 
    "39": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a new beta-receptor blocking agent, celiprolol, was compared with that of a well-established antihypertensive drug, metoprolol. Their systemic and forearm hemodynamic effects were investigated using echocardiography and two-dimensional pulsed Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Twenty hypertensive patients completed a double-blind, cross-over, randomized study using celiprolol and metoprolol. Two six-week courses with celiprolol or metoprolol were preceded and followed by a two-week placebo period; the total duration of the study was 18 weeks. In spite of a comparable efficacy in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (about 10% of the basal value), the two drugs showed quite different systemic and regional hemodynamic effects. Celiprolol induced a significant decrease in forearm vascular resistance (from 157 +/- 17 to 113 +/- 13 mm Hg/mL/s, P less than .01) and total peripheral resistance (from 1596 +/- 90 to 1398 +/- 91 dyne.s.cm-5, P less than .05) whereas cardiac output remained unchanged and forearm blood flow increased. Metoprolol reduced cardiac output (from 6.5 +/- 3 to 5.7 +/- 3 L/min, P less than .05), through a reduction in heart rate, since stroke volume was unchanged. Both drugs did not significantly modify cardiac performance, as evaluated by left ventricle fractional shortening and ejection fraction. Thus, the two drugs seem to reduce blood pressure through different hemodynamic mechanisms.", 
    "40": "The effect of timolol on postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge, blood pressure, heart rate, and rhythm changes associated with acute coronary occlusion of the left anterior descending artery was examined and compared with the effects of the beta blockers practolol and metoprolol. Timolol (5 mg/kg, IV) was infused 15 minutes prior to coronary occlusion in cats anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. Control heart rate fell from 129 +/- 10 to 106 +/- 2 one minute prior to coronary occlusion and remained at 106 +/- 2 beats/minute in the minute prior to arrhythmia. Control blood pressure fell from 126 +/- 20 to 91 +/- 19 and stabilized at 99 +/- 19 mm Hg one minute prior to coronary occlusion. Mean time to arrhythmia and death was 4.7 +/- 2.3 and 68.0 +/- 51.0 minutes (P greater than .05 vs no drug), respectively. Three cats died and two were sacrificed six hours after coronary occlusion. Blood pressure fell to 86 +/- 20 mm Hg two minutes after coronary occlusion, rose to 95 +/- 23 mm Hg at ten minutes, and remained there for ten minutes. Timolol did not alter postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge prior to coronary occlusion. Two minutes after coronary occlusion, mean postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge was 128 +/- 27 and increased to 139 +/- 36 impulses/second (% control) 4 minutes after coronary occlusion. A similar trend was found for the data recorded in 15 nerves (eight cats) in which coronary occlusion was initiated without timolol. The data suggest that a difference exists among beta blockers because prior to coronary occlusion, the cardioselective drugs metoprolol (1, 5, and 10 mg/kg, IV) and practolol (8 mg/kg, IV) depressed postganglionic cardiac sympathetic neural discharge whereas noncardioselective timolol did not. Because all three beta blockers increased the times to arrhythmia and death (although the increase was significant only after metoprolol and practolol), the acute protective mechanism does not appear to be due primarily to a depression of spontaneous sympathetic neural discharge.", 
    "41": "The hemodynamic effects of esmolol were evaluated in 12 male patients at rest (mean age, 51 +/- 10 years) undergoing routine cardiac catheterization. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained during baseline (prior to esmolol), at steady state (during an intravenous infusion of esmolol 300 micrograms/kg/min), and at 30 minutes after stopping esmolol (postinfusion). Esmolol produced hemodynamic effects similar to the effects of other beta blockers. Significant reductions in rate-pressure product (mean decrease, 15%), cardiac index (mean decrease, 17%), stroke volume index (mean decrease, 13%), left ventricular stroke work index (mean decrease, 20%), and left ventricular ejection fraction (mean decrease, 18%) were observed. In contrast to other beta blockers, all hemodynamic effects of esmolol had returned to baseline values within 30 minutes after the infusion stopped. One patient exhibited hypotension during the esmolol infusion; this episode resolved without sequelae after discontinuation of esmolol. In summary, the effects of esmolol at rest on hemodynamic parameters and left ventricular function are similar to other beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Due to its ultrashort half-life, esmolol can be administered safely in critically ill patients whose disease status makes treatment with currently available beta blockers risky.", 
    "42": "An open-label baseline-controlled study was conducted in 11 healthy male subjects to study the possible interaction between the cardioselective, short-acting beta blocker esmolol and digoxin when administered concurrently under steady-state conditions. Steady-state concentration, elimination half-life, and the total body clearance of esmolol were not changed significantly (P greater than .05) by digoxin. Digoxin peak concentration and the time to reach the peak concentration were not affected by esmolol. However, the digoxin AUC during the six-hour esmolol infusion increased from 2.60 +/- 0.59 to 2.88 +/- 0.75 ng.hr/mL (P less than .05). There were no clinically significant changes in the heart rate and blood pressure during this drug interaction study. The PR intervals were similar between digoxin monotherapy and esmolol plus digoxin combined treatment. Although digoxin did not influence the kinetics of esmolol, the small increase seen in digoxin serum concentration during the combination therapy warrants that caution be exercised during concurrent administration of esmolol and digoxin to patients.", 
    "43": "The effect on plasma lipids of a new beta-blocker bucindolol, which possesses weak alpha-adrenergic blocking property and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, given orally over a 3-month period as a monotherapy or with a thiazide diuretic to 44 patients with essential hypertension was studied. The mean level of plasma HDL cholesterol concentration increased significantly during 3 months monotherapy with bucindolol or with bucindolol and diuretic. This increase was due to the increase of HDL3 subfraction. There were no significant changes in the concentrations of plasma triglycerides or total cholesterol during treatment. The ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol increased significantly. The concentration of apoprotein A-I decreased significantly in both treatment groups, but the level of apoprotein B remained constant among treatment groups. The results support the earlier observations that beta-adrenergic blocking agents with different pharmacologic properties differ as regard to their effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins.", 
    "44": "Values of plasma free cortisol (not bound to plasma proteins), total plasma cortisol, and percent free cortisol were determined in normal, ocular hypertensive, and open angle glaucomatous subjects. Median total plasma, plasma free, and percent free cortisol levels were higher in ocular hypertensive and glaucomatous individuals. The most significant differences occurred with percent free cortisol values between normal and glaucomatous subjects. There was a significant positive correlation between percent free cortisol and total cortisol levels in normal subjects only. For subjects with glaucoma and hypertension, the percent free cortisol values were independent of the total cortisol values. Multilinear regression analysis also indicated that besides diagnosis and level of total plasma cortisol, male sex, blood sampling late in the day, and increased diastolic blood pressure were the only variables significantly related to increased values of plasma free cortisol and percent free cortisol. Ocular medication for glaucoma and use of beta-blockers were not found to be significant independent variables in the regression models for either plasma free cortisol or percent free cortisol. These observations further suggest that a disorder of the pituitary adrenal axis and/or a binding of plasma cortisol is associated with ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma.", 
    "45": "Increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during exercise have been reported. To investigate the role of tachycardia as a stimulus for release of ANP during exercise the following study was undertaken. Graded exercise was performed in six healthy volunteers before and after beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade. Plasma levels of ANP were determined at different workloads in both cases. At rest and at all workloads during exercise plasma levels of ANP were higher after beta 1-adrenoceptor blockade than without. Therefore, it is unlikely that tachycardia is a major stimulus for secretion of ANP during exercise. It is suggested that increased right atrial pressure and/or pulmonary arterial blood pressure and increased plasma levels of catecholamines are important secretory stimuli for ANP during exercise.", 
    "46": "The pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol were investigated following oral administration of 10mg once daily for 7 days in 8 healthy subjects, in 14 patients with different degrees of renal impairment and in 18 patients with liver disease. In healthy subjects peak and trough steady-state concentrations of 52 micrograms/L and 11 micrograms/L, respectively, an elimination half-life of 10.0 hours and total body clearance of 14.2 L/h were observed. 5.21 mg/24 hours of unchanged bisoprolol were recovered following urinary excretion during the dosage interval. In 11 patients with renal impairment (mean CLCR = 28 +/- 5 ml/min/1.72m2) half-life was prolonged to 18.5 hours, and peak and trough concentrations were 74 and 32 micrograms/L, respectively. Correspondingly, urinary excretion decreased to 3.35 mg/24 hours and total body clearance to 7.8 L/h. In uraemic patients (CLCR less than 5 ml/min/1.73m2) the total clearance of bisoprolol was 5.0 L/h and the elimination half-life was 24.2 hours. In patients with liver cirrhosis half-life increased to 13.5 hours, steady-state peak and trough concentrations increased to 62 and 22 micrograms/L, respectively, and total body clearance decreased to 10.8 L/h. The present study indicates that in patients with impairment of kidney or liver function accumulation of bisoprolol above a factor of 2 did not occur. However, in the terminal stages of insufficiency of kidney or liver function bisoprolol dosage should not exceed 10mg.", 
    "47": "Four groups of eight normotensive male volunteers performed a 60 min bicycle exercise test before and after 2 weeks of either placebo, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 25 mg day-1), pindolol (PIND, 10 mg day-1) or both drugs in combination using a double-blind, randomized design. During exercise on placebo serum potassium increased by 0.8 mmol l-1. HCTZ significantly decreased potassium levels at rest and during exercise by 0.2 mmol l-1. PIND did not affect resting potassium levels but potentiated the increase by 0.4 mmol l-1 at the end of exercise, and delayed the return to normal of serum potassium after exercise. The addition of HCTZ to PIND offset the potentiating effect of PIND on exercise-induced hyperkalaemia (only after prolonged exercise) and accelerated the return to baseline after exercise. The results indicate that the hypokalaemic effect of HCTZ can oppose the hyperkalaemic effect of PIND during prolonged physical exercise and particularly during recovery.", 
    "48": "1 We have studied the effects of single oral doses of 80 mg propranolol and 100 mg atenolol on breathing during progressive exercise in nine healthy men in a double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment. As judged by their effects on exercise heart rate significant levels of beta-adrenoceptor blockade were achieved. 2 At the two lower levels of work rate (50 watts and 100 watts) minute ventilation on atenolol was lower than on placebo while at the highest level of work (200 watts) minute ventilation was higher on atenolol than on placebo. The regression of VE atenolol on VE placebo was 1.28 which is significantly different from unity (P less than 0.001). The results with propranolol were more scattered and failed to reach the 5% level of significance. 3 Effects on the pattern of breathing are small but when minute ventilation is matched with placebo, atenolol results in larger tidal volumes and prolonged inspiratory and expiratory time. 4 These observations are discussed in relation to other work in the literature.", 
    "49": "1 To compare the haemodynamic effects of secondary characteristics of beta-adrenoceptor blockers with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor forty patients with previously untreated mild to moderate hypertension were prescribed either atenolol 50-100 mg day-1, labetalol 200-800 mg day-1, pindolol 10-30 mg day-1 or captopril 25-100 mg day-1 and observed for 6 months. 2 Over this period: (a) All four drugs produced similar reductions in blood pressure at rest (P less than or equal to 0.01) and after exercise (P less than or equal to 0.01). (b) All four drugs significantly decreased resting forearm (P less than or equal to 0.01) and calf blood flow (P less than or equal to 0.01). They all also caused a significant reduction in the increased calf blood flow following exercise (P less than or equal to 0.01). (c) No drug produced a change in resting forearm vascular resistance, while resting calf vascular resistance was decreased by captopril and pindolol, unaltered by labetalol and increased by atenolol. Post-exercise calf vascular resistance was increased by atenolol, labetalol and pindolol but unaltered by captopril. (d) Although all four drugs produced a fall in resting heart rate this was significantly greater for atenolol and labetalol (P less than or equal to 0.01). All four treatments however significantly reduced the increase in heart rate following exercise (P less than or equal to 0.01). (e) No drug produced any significant change in resting and post-exercise stroke volume/ejection fraction. 3 It is concluded that despite differing modes of action all four drugs reduce limb blood flow. This primarily appears to be a consequence of reduced perfusion pressure associated with limited autoregulation of skeletal muscle circulation. The reduction in arterial vascular resistance produced by captopril and pindolol is inconsistent and does not appear of major benefit in preserving limb blood flow. The reduction in perfusion with the agents studied may in part be related to a fall in cardiac output associated with decreased heart rate. This suggests that captopril may exert antisympathetic activity when used as an antihypertensive agent.", 
    "50": "1 Eight men with primary hypertension were treated for 3 weeks with placebo, epanolol (200 mg or 400 mg), or atenolol 100 mg in a randomised cross-over study. Each active treatment period was preceded by a 3 week placebo treatment period and both investigators and subjects were blind to the active drug sequence. 2 At the end of each period, measurements were made of resting cardiovascular (heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow) and biochemical variables (plasma renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline, vasopressin, sodium and potassium concentrations and osmolality). Responses to exercise (including gas exchange, sweat rate, and ratings of perceived exertion) and the reflex cardiovascular adjustments to distal body subatmospheric pressure were also assessed. 3 The reduction of exercise-induced tachycardia by epanolol 400 mg was comparable to that of atenolol. There was very little difference in the effects of atenolol or epanolol 400 mg on resting blood pressure, but in both cases blood pressures were usually significantly lower than with epanolol 200 mg. 4 Although each active treatment influenced the renin-angiotensin system and circulating levels of catecholamines, the exercise-induced reduction in blood pressure was unaffected. Thus, the hypotensive effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions were additive.", 
    "51": "In vivo experiments were performed in autoperfused hindlimbs of rabbits to investigate the role of endothelium-mediated vasomotion in resistance-sized vessels. The flow responses to the vasodilators acetylcholine (ACh), ATP, and substance P (SP), all of which have been shown to act in an endothelium-dependent manner in large conduit arteries, were studied before and after exposure of the hindleg vasculature to gossypol (a potent inhibitor of endothelium-mediated vasodilation in vitro). The flow responses to adenosine (ADO), nitroglycerin (GTN), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which induce relaxation by a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle, were tested in the same manner. All vasodilators induced dose-dependent increases in femoral flow up to two- to threefold when administered intra-arterially. After gossypol, the flow responses to the endothelium-dependent compounds (ACh, ATP, and SP) were severely reduced (by 88 +/- 3%, P less than 0.01) or sometimes were converted to constrictions (ATP). The flow increases induced by ADO, PGE2, and GTN remained largely unaffected. Sham treatment (gossypol solute only), exposure to indomethacin (10 microM), and ganglionic blockade had no differential effect on the flow responses. The selective action of gossypol in suppressing the flow responses to the endothelium-dependent compounds ACh, ATP, and SP is consistent with a vasomotor role for endothelial cells in resistance-sized vessels in vivo.", 
    "52": "Depression is believed to be a common side effect in patients receiving beta-blocker therapy. However, diagnoses of depression defined by current diagnostic criteria may not be more common in patients receiving beta-blockers than in patients with the same medical disorder receiving other medications. Seventy-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac catheterization for evaluation of chest pain received a semi-structured diagnostic psychiatric interview. Twenty-one percent of the patients receiving beta-blockers and 33 percent of the patients receiving medications other than beta-blockers met the current American Psychiatric Association criteria for major depressive disorder (DSM-III) (p = NS). The mean heart rate and state anxiety scores for patients taking beta-blockers were significantly lower than those measured in patients taking medications other than beta-blockers. No other medical or demographic differences were observed between the two groups. Despite the methodologic limitations of the study, there does not appear to be a difference in the point prevalence of depression between patients receiving beta-blockers and those receiving other medications.", 
    "53": "To investigate the influence of selective beta 1-adrenergic blockade, in contrast to beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic blockade, systemic and coronary hemodynamics were studied. Measurements were made at rest and during exercise in 23 patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) before and after either metoprolol or propranolol, given in doses to provide comparable beta 1-receptor blockade. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at rest. Using a randomized, double-blind protocol, either beta 1 and beta 2 blockade was produced by propranolol (0.1 mg/kg intravenously), or selective beta 1 blockade was produced by metoprolol (0.15 mg/kg intravenously). As expected, at these doses both drugs produced a comparable decrease in heart rate at rest and during exercise, averaging 9% and 14% after propranolol and 10% and 16% after metoprolol. Exercise duration to ischemia was prolonged in most patients with severe CAD after either propranolol (5 of 7) or metoprolol (6 of 10) treatment. The effects of these 2 beta-blocking drugs on systemic hemodynamic values at rest and during exercise were similar. Additionally, coronary sinus flow was usually unchanged by both drugs at rest (-5% after propranolol and -4% after metoprolol, differences not significant) and decreased a similar amount during exercise (-15% after propranolol and -9% after metoprolol, both p less than 0.05). Coronary resistance did not change significantly with either drug (0% after propranolol and 3% after metoprolol), and during exercise (11% after propranolol and 3% after metoprolol), suggesting that decreases in flow were secondary to reduced demand. Furthermore, neither drug produced detectable changes in coronary artery size.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Low concentrations of ethanol (10-100 mM), added to assays in vitro, altered agonist (isoproterenol) binding to mouse cerebral cortical beta-adrenergic receptors in a reversible manner. Ethanol decreased the affinity of the high affinity form of the receptor for isoproterenol but had no effect on the affinity of the low affinity form of the receptor, the proportion of high and low affinity forms of the receptor, the total number of agonist-binding sites, or antagonist binding. The selective effect of ethanol on the properties of the high affinity agonist-binding site suggested that ethanol alters the characteristics of the complex of the receptor and Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein. In cerebral cortical membranes of mice that had ingested ethanol chronically, isoproterenol binding data were best fit by a one-site model, even in the absence of guanine nucleotides. This change, when considered together with previously reported changes in adenylate cyclase activity, is reminiscent of heterologous desensitization of the beta-adrenergic receptor. Thus, both acute and chronic ethanol administration may produce changes in adrenergic function in brain.", 
    "55": "The results of a number of studies have implicated beta adrenergic receptors in the brain in the actions of proven antidepressant drugs. This suspected involvement of central beta adrenergic receptors made it of interest to characterize the behavioral effects of centrally acting beta adrenergic agonists. Clenbuterol and prenalterol, unlike most beta adrenergic agonists, penetrate into the central nervous system after peripheral administration. In the present study, the effects of these agonists on behavior maintained under a multiple fixed-interval 5-min, fixed-ratio 30-response schedule were determined. Both compounds, in a dose-dependent manner, reduced response rate under both components of the multiple schedule. Under the fixed-interval component, clenbuterol and prenalterol altered the temporal pattern of responding. At no dose tested was there evidence for any stimulant action of either of the drugs. The effects of clenbuterol and prenalterol on behavior maintained under the multiple schedule appeared to be a result of an interaction of the agonists with beta adrenergic receptors. This was evidenced by the ability of the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol to block the effects of the agonists. The behavioral effects of clenbuterol and prenalterol appear, in general, to be similar to effects reported previously for tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibiting antidepressant drugs.", 
    "56": "To study the effects of beta-2 agonist on metabolic regulation in fetal lamb lung, ritodrine hydrochloride, a preferential beta-2 agonist, was infused i.v. at a rate of 1.3 +/- 0.4 micrograms/kg/min (mean +/- S.D.) for 24 hr into six twin chronically catheterized fetal lambs starting between 0.86 and 0.91 gestation. Lung glycogen was depleted 56% in the ritodrine-infused twins and glycogen phosphorylase a activity was increased 1.8-fold whereas glycogen synthase activity remained unchanged. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity increased 1.7-fold, calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (phosphorylase kinase) activity increased 1.4-fold and calcium-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) activity increased 1.6-fold. In addition, the maximal binding capacity of pulmonary beta receptors decreased 49% in the ritodrine-infused twins. However, lung cyclic AMP content was unchanged after 24 hr of ritodrine infusion. We conclude that beta-2 agonist activates protein kinases, depletes glycogen and reduces the binding capacity of beta receptors in the fetal lamb lung. We speculate that these adrenergic mechanisms are involved in regulating the effects of beta-2 agonist on fetal lung liquid and surfactant production.", 
    "57": "The insulin effect following hypoglycemia was studied with the euglycemic clamp technique in seven healthy subjects. Following an initial euglycemic clamp hypoglycemia was induced and after glucose recovery a second clamp was performed. Glucose production (Ra) and utilization (Rd) were studied with [3-3H]glucose. Each subject was studied four times; during infusion of placebo, propranolol, somatostatin, and a control study where hypoglycemia was prevented. Hypoglycemia induced an insulin resistance with a lower steady state glucose infusion rate following the hypoglycemia during placebo as compared to the control study (2.5 +/- 0.5 and 4.8 +/- 1.0 mg/kg min, respectively, P less than 0.05). The insulin resistance was due to an attenuated insulin effect on both inhibition of Ra (impaired by 37%) and stimulation of Rd (impaired by 61%). The insulin-antagonistic effect was completely prevented by propranolol but only partly by somatostatin. Thus, early posthypoglycemic insulin resistance (2.5-3.5 h after hypoglycemia) is a sustained effect mainly due to beta-adrenergic stimulation.", 
    "58": "Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are commonly used in combination with digitalis to control excessive heart rate during exercise in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. However, little is known about the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on exercise capacity in these patients. Accordingly, a randomized, double-blind, cross-over placebo-controlled study was performed to assess the efficacy of celiprolol, a new cardioselective beta-blocker with partial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, on exercise performance in nine men with chronic atrial fibrillation. All but one patient was receiving maintenance digitalis during the study. Heart rate, blood pressure and gas exchange variables were measured at rest and during treadmill exercise testing while the patients were receiving maintenance celiprolol or placebo. Significant reductions in heart rate and systolic blood pressure compared with control values were observed at submaximal exercise, at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold and at maximal exertion while the patients were taking celiprolol. However, oxygen uptake at the gas exchange anaerobic threshold during celiprolol therapy was 12.3 versus 14.0 ml oxygen/kg per min during placebo administration (a 12% difference, p less than 0.01). Similarly, oxygen uptake at maximal exertion during celiprolol therapy was 17.6 versus 21.0 ml/kg per min during placebo administration (a 16% difference, p less than 0.01). Treadmill time was also reduced during the celiprolol phase compared with placebo (11.3 versus 10.3 minutes; a 19% difference, p less than 0.01). These results indicate that in patients with atrial fibrillation the major beneficial effects of beta-adrenergic blockade--reduced submaximal and maximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure--must be weighed against the decrease in exercise capacity.", 
    "59": "The impairment of glucose-potentiated insulin secretion present in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) can be approximated in normal subjects by an epinephrine infusion. Therefore, we sought to determine the role of the endogenous sympathetic nervous system in glucose-potentiated insulin secretion in both NIDDM (n = 6) and normal (n = 6) subjects. Glucose-potentiated insulin secretion was calculated as the slope of the curve relating increasing ambient glucose levels to the acute insulin response to an intravenous pulse of 5 g of L-arginine. Glucose-potentiated insulin secretion was determined on separate days during alpha-, beta-, and combined alpha- plus beta-adrenergic blockade and compared with a saline control. In normal subjects, there was no effect of alpha-, beta-, or alpha- plus beta-blockade on the slope of glucose potentiation. In NIDDM, the initially decreased slope of glucose potentiation (0.25 +/- 0.06 microU X ml-1 X mg-1 X dl, mean +/- SE; P less than .01) was not affected by beta-blockade but increased during alpha-blockade (0.91 +/- 0.22 microU X ml-1 X mg-1 X dl; P less than .05). However, this improvement was abolished by combined alpha- plus beta-blockade (0.32 +/- 0.07 microU X ml-1 X mg-1 X dl). Plasma norepinephrine was increased above basal levels in both normal (+260 +/- 89 pg/ml) and NIDDM (+438 +/- 162 pg/ml) subjects during alpha-blockade (P less than .05 for both). This increase in plasma norepinephrine strongly suggests that there is an increase in synaptic cleft norepinephrine concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "The roles of the autonomic nervous system, renin-angiotensin system, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) during the onset of ACTH-induced hypertension were investigated in conscious sheep. Autonomic ganglion blockade or combined adrenergic and cholinergic receptor blockade demonstrated that an intact sympathetic nervous system was not essential for the development or maintenance of the hypertension. Autonomic blockade augmented the pressor response to ACTH, indicating that baroreceptor-mediated reflexes normally operate to suppress the degree of hypertension produced by ACTH. Evidence was obtained suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system and AVP may partially contribute to the maintenance of ACTH hypertension in the presence of autonomic blockade. However, the precise mechanism by which ACTH raises arterial pressure remains to be elucidated.", 
    "61": "To assess the involvement of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors in the regulation of venous return in humans, changes in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVED) dimension were determined during beta-receptor stimulation either by exogenous catecholamines or by increased endogenous sympathetic activity after hydralazine, after placebo and during nonselective versus beta 1-selective blockade. Taking changes in heart rate and LV emptying into account, the three beta-agonists (isoproterenol, terbutaline, and epinephrine) as well as hydralazine increased venous return as inferred from LVED dimension. After hydralazine, nonselective and beta 1-selective blockade were equally effective in blunting the increases in venous return, in heart rate, and in positive inotropic response. Beta 1-Selective blockade did not affect the increase in heart rate caused by epinephrine and partially inhibited the positive inotropic effect and the increase in venous return. Nonselective blockade not only blocked the increase in venous return owing to epinephrine but actually led to a decrease, as evidenced by a decrease in LVED dimension despite the marked bradycardia and high afterload with this combination. The present findings in healthy humans indicate that stimulation of both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors increases venous return, heart rate, and myocardial contractility. Beta 1-Receptors appear to predominate in the response to neuronal sympathetic activity.", 
    "62": "With the use of circulating norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) levels, the sympathoadrenal activity as well as its local modulation by adrenoceptors were studied in normotensive (NT) and DOCA-salt hypertensive (HT) rats. In anesthetized hypertensive rats, plasma NE levels were higher, whereas in conscious animals both NE and E levels were found to be increased, suggesting an increased basal sympathoadrenal tone in these animals. The finding of a close correlation between blood pressure levels and NE levels suggests that the elevation of blood pressure may be linked to sympathetic system activity in this experimental model of hypertension. The reactivity of the sympathoadrenal system was also found to be increased in DOCA HT rats. Following a bilateral carotid occlusion of 1 min, which specifically activates the adrenal medulla, the elevation of E levels was found to be potentiated in intact or vagotomized HT rats. Moreover, in response to prolonged or acute hypotension in anesthetized and conscious animals, the elevation in plasma NE and E levels was found to be markedly potentiated in DOCA HT rats. The local modulating adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms of the sympathoadrenal system appeared to be altered in this model of hypertension. Although it was possible to demonstrate that the E response to carotid occlusion can be greatly potentiated by administration of an alpha2-antagonist (yohimbine) and completely abolished by an alpha2-agonist (clonidine) in NT rats, the E response was found to be unaffected by the same treatments in HT rats, suggesting a reduced sensitivity in the alpha2-mediated inhibitory modulation of the adrenal medulla. Moreover, the acute treatment with a beta-blocker (sotalol) lowered circulating NE levels and blood pressure only in HT rats, suggesting the possibility of a more sensitive beta-receptor-mediated presynaptic facilitatory mechanism on sympathetic fibers of these animals. Finally, it was observed that the functional balance which exists between the activities of sympathetic fibers and the adrenal medulla in normotensive animals appears to be impaired in DOCA HT rats. In conclusion, the present studies suggest that the increased sympathoadrenal tone and reactivity may be due, in part, to a variety of dysfunctions in local adrenoceptor modulatory mechanisms of the sympathoadrenal system in DOCA hypertensive rats.", 
    "63": "We studied biochemical and morphological changes in central catecholamine (CA) terminals in the kitten visual cortex following direct infusion with 4 mM 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) for a week. Two zones may be distinguished within the cortical area affected by 6-OHDA (a radius of approximately 10 mm). In the primary lesion zone (a radius of approximately 5 mm) near the center of the 6-OHDA infusion, excluding an area of non-specific damage left by cannulation (a radius of less than 1.5 mm), we found: (1) absence of fluorescent CA terminals by histochemistry; (2) very low desipramine-sensitive uptake of tritiated norepinephrine (NE) by cortical slices (desipramine-resistant NE uptake stayed high); (3) a 50% increase in beta-adrenoreceptor binding sites by densitometry of light microscopic autoradiograms; and (4) low levels (less than 20% of control) of endogenous NE and low to moderate levels (10-70%) of endogenous dopamine (DA). In the surrounding zone (about 5-10 mm from the infusion center), however, none of the above changes were observed, except for a moderate to substantial reduction (50-80% of control) in endogenous NE and a small (10-20%) reduction in endogenous DA. Within two weeks after the end of the cortical 6-OHDA infusion, the dimensions of the cortical area devoid of CA terminals became substantially smaller than those found earlier. Fluorescent CA terminals were seen virtually everywhere in the cortex by 4 weeks, including the scar left by placement of the infusion cannula. In 24 weeks CA terminals in the occipital cortex appeared close to normal in density as well as in fluorescence intensity. Biochemical assays also revealed the recovery trend of CA contents. A steady increase in the NE content was obtained in the surrounding zone, with the stronger trend at its periphery, eventually attaining full recovery in 23 weeks. The recovery was slow in the primary lesion zone, especially near the infusion center, though there was a continual increase in endogenous DA toward control even at the infusion center.", 
    "64": "The aim of the present work was to demonstrate the presence of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in the rabbit isolated pulmonary artery by investigating the effect of isoprenaline on 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA) release evoked by electrical field stimulation. (-)-Isoprenaline (10(-7)-10(-6) mol/l) had no effect on the 3H-overflow evoked by stimulation (3 Hz) of the pulmonary artery preloaded with 3H-NA. At 10(-5) mol/l, (-)-isoprenaline reduced the 3H-overflow by maximally 39%. (-)-Isoprenaline (10(-5) mol/l) caused an inhibition that remained almost constant with time. The same results were obtained with (-)-isoprenaline (10(-7)-3 X 10(-5) mol/l) in the presence of cocaine (3 X 10(-5) mol/l), corticosterone (4 X 10(-5) mol/l), and the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor U-0521 (3',4'-dihydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone) (10(-4) mol/l). In the presence of cocaine plus corticosterone, (-)-isoprenaline (3 X 10(-10)-10(-7) mol/l) had no effect on the 3H-overflow evoked by stimulation at 1 Hz. At 10(-6) mol/l, (-)-isoprenaline slightly reduced the 3H-overflow. At 10 Hz, (-)-isoprenaline (10(-6)-3 X 10(-5) mol/l) decreased the 3H-overflow and had no effect at 10(-7) mol/l. In the presence of either rauwolscine (10(-6) mol/l), phentolamine (10(-6) mol/l) or the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ICI 63,197 (3 X 10(-5) mol/l), (-)-isoprenaline (10(-7)-10(-6) mol/l) did not enhance the stimulation-evoked 3H-overflow.

    "65": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of epinephrine on neurotransmission mediated by cholinergic neurons derived from the rat retina. We used a culture system in which striated muscle cells served as postsynaptic targets for cholinergic neurons of the embryonic retina. This culture system permitted the physiological monitoring of acetylcholine released by retinal neurons. Here, we report that epinephrine facilitates evoked transmission across retina-muscle synapses. This facilitation of cholinergic transmission by epinephrine is reversible, can be mimicked by isoproterenol (a beta adrenoceptor agonist) and blocked by propranolol (a beta adrenoceptor antagonist). Neither the alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocker, yohimbine, nor the dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, blocked this effect of epinephrine. Since epinephrine was found not to influence the membrane potential of muscle cells nor the responses of myotubes to acetylcholine, epinephrine appeared to have mediated its facilitatory effect on cholinergic transmission by affecting retinal cells. Because previous findings indicated that adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate may be involved in the modulation of transmission at retina-muscle synapses, the effect of epinephrine on adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels was investigated. Our biochemical studies demonstrated that epinephrine could increase adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels markedly in cultured retinal cells. The accumulation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate induced by epinephrine could be blocked by propranolol, but not by yohimbine nor haloperidol. Taken together, the results indicate that the facilitatory effect of epinephrine is mediated via a beta adrenoceptor and may involve an increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate levels. Our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that epinephrine may be a modulatory neurotransmitter in the rat retina.", 
    "66": "This study was designed to assess the efficacy of 100 mg atenolol daily, 20 mg enalapril daily and a low-dose combination of 50 mg atenolol and 10 mg enalapril, in reducing blood pressure at rest and during ergometry (50-100 W). Twenty-three men and three women (aged 25-56 years, mean 44.5 +/- 7.4 years) were admitted to this randomized, single (observer)-blind crossover study, which had a 2-week placebo period and 4-week treatment periods. Both atenolol and enalapril provided significant (P less than 0.001) and almost identical reductions in blood pressure at rest. However, during exercise, systolic blood pressure decreased with atenolol and with the combination of atenolol and enalapril by 15.8% and 18.4%, respectively, compared with 6.2% with enalapril monotherapy. The differential effect of atenolol and enalapril was also demonstrated for the rate-pressure product. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly lower (P less than 0.01) with atenolol (139.5/92.8 +/- 17/12 mmHg) than with enalapril (146.8/97.7 +/- 17/9 mmHg). It is concluded that atenolol is significantly more effective in reducing systolic blood pressure during exercise than enalapril, and that the addition of atenolol to enalapril therapy produces a significant supplementary antihypertensive effect.", 
    "67": "A fall in blood pressure occurs, in most patients, within a few hours of a single dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. While a serious fall in pressure is unusual in previously untreated essential hypertension, some patients are at risk of severe first-dose hypotension. These include those with treated heart failure, severe hypertension on polypharmacy, 'renin-dependent' renovascular hypertension and the occasional elderly patient. In such groups of patients the incidence of severe, symptomatic first-dose hypotension approaches 10%. This effect is not specific for ACE inhibitor therapy and may well occur as frequently with other drugs in such patients. First-dose hypotension may not be accompanied by tachycardia, possibly as a result of a parasympathomimetic action that may contribute to the first-dose effect. It is generally not possible to predict patients at risk, although plasma renin and angiotensin II concentrations show a modest positive correlation with the initial fall in blood pressure. The maximum initial hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitors is not clearly dose related but the duration of effect may be. Therefore such drugs should be started at minimum effective dosage. High-risk patients should be observed closely for at least 6 h. Symptomatic hypotension usually responds to supine rest although infusion of angiotensin II, atropine and occasionally saline may be required.", 
    "68": "Enalapril in single doses of 5 and 10 mg and atenolol in a single dose of 50 mg were given to 16 hypertensive patients on long-term treatment with bendrofluazide, 5 mg daily, in a double-blind randomized crossover placebo controlled study. Both doses of enalapril and atenolol produced similar effects on blood pressure. The mean maximal reduction in blood pressure from baseline with all three active treatments was approximately 32/18 mmHg both supine and standing and occurred on average at 6 h after tablet ingestion. Both supine and standing heart rate fell significantly after atenolol, but no significant change occurred after enalapril. This study establishes that 5 mg enalapril is the maximal starting dose that need be used in hypertensive patients already on diuretic treatment. Even this dose may be hazardous in some patients. The study also serves to emphasize that such combination-therapy studies should be carried out at an early stage in drug development, prior to widespread prescription to patients, in order to avoid unnecessary overdosage with new agents.", 
    "69": "Adrenergic receptors were identified in healthy human hepatic tissue from thirty-nine subjects undergoing elective abdominal surgery by using the specific alpha 1-antagonist [3H]-prazosin and the beta adrenergic antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA). [3H]-prazosin binding to plasma membranes was rapid, of high affinity, saturable and stereospecific with a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 74.1 +/- 5.5 fmol mg-1 of protein. The displacement curve for (-)-norepinephrine was better explained by a one-site binding and after addition of GTP 0.1 mM the curve was not right-shifted, suggesting the majority of alpha receptors in healthy human liver are of the alpha 1 subtype and not linked to a GTP-binding protein. [3H]-DHA binding to liver plasma membranes was also rapid, of high affinity, saturable and stereospecific with a Bmax 96.5 +/- 10.3 fmol mg-1 of protein of receptors. Computer aided analysis of the displacement curve of ICI 118,551, a subtype selective beta 2-antagonist (IC50 = 62 +/- 2 nM), indicated a one-site binding, thus, showing that beta adrenergic receptors are of the beta 2 subtype. The displacement curve of [3H]-DHA for (-)-isoproterenol was right shifted by GTP indicating that beta 2 adrenergic receptors are linked to a GTP-binding protein in human liver. These results indicate that alpha 1- and beta 2-receptors co-exist in human liver but only beta 2-receptors are linked to a GTP-binding protein.", 
    "70": "Repeated, daily administration of either an electroconvulsive shock (ECS; 110 V, 1 sec) or desipramine (DMI; 5 mg/kg X 2) to rats caused a progressive decrease in the function of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors, assessed by the hypoactivity (sedation) response to clonidine (0.2 mg/kg). This attenuation required approximately 7 days' administration of either treatment for maximum effect. A single injection of triiodothyronine (T3; 100 micrograms/kg) on day 1 of the treatment markedly accelerated the decreased responses to clonidine induced by DMI or electroconvulsive shock, but did not alter the maximum attenuation. By itself T3 did not affect the hypoactivity responses. alpha 2-Adrenoceptors, measured by the binding of [3H]idazoxan in the cortex, which are believed to be predominantly postsynaptic, were decreased by 14 days of DMI or electroconvulsive shock for 10 days, but not 2 days of either treatment. Triiodothyronine did not influence the decreased number of alpha 2-adrenoceptors induced by DMI or electroconvulsive shock but may have delayed the onset produced by DMI. Binding to beta-adrenoceptors in the cortex was measured using [3H]dihydroalprenolol. This was significantly decreased by 14 days administration of DMI, but not significantly by electroconvulsive shock for 10. Down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors, induced by DMI was rapid, being observed after 1 day of treatment. Injection of T3 did not influence the final decreases produced by DMI or electroconvulsive shocks but moderately delayed their onset. Triiodothyronine alone caused a 25% reduction in cortical beta-adrenoceptors 24 hr after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Selective beta 1-receptor blockade with atenolol (1 mg X kg-1, i.v.) was used to determine the effect of partial exercise training on diastolic coronary resistance (DCR) during sub-maximal exercise. Seven conscious dogs were studied in the untrained (UT) and partially trained (PT) conditions. The conditioning regime consisted of treadmill running 5 d X wk-1 for 4 to 5 wk. Left circumflex coronary flow, aortic pressure, and heart rate were measured, and DCR and myocardial oxygen consumption were calculated. During sub-maximal exercise, DCR in the UT dogs decreased from a resting value of 4.08 +/- 0.18 mm Hg X ml-1 X min-1 to 1.91 +/- 0.17 mm Hg X ml-1 X min-1 at a workload of 6.4 kph (speed)/16% (grade). During exercise, DCR was significantly greater in UT than in PT dogs. Atenolol significantly increased DCR at all levels of sub-maximal workload in both UT and PT dogs. However, the percent increase in DCR with atenolol was significantly greater in the PT dogs compared to UT dogs. These findings suggest that daily exercise for 4 to 5 wk may decrease beta 2-receptor activity of the coronary vasculature during sub-maximal exercise.", 
    "72": "We correlated the ontogeny of pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptors with the onset of surface active material (SAM) flux into tracheal fluid of male and female chronically catheterized fetal lambs. SAM flux began between 0.82 and 0.85 gestation in the females and between 0.85 and 0.89 gestation in the males and matured more rapidly thereafter in the females than in the males (P less than 0.01). beta-Adrenergic receptor binding, using [3H]dihydroalprenolol as the ligand, was saturable, linear, and stereospecific. The order of potency of competitive beta-agonists was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine. The maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of pulmonary beta-receptors approximately doubled between 0.84 and 0.89 gestation, coinciding with the onset of SAM flux. Bmax matured as a third degree polynomial function of gestational age in females (r = 0.9, P less than 0.001) but as a linear function in males (r = 0.8, P less than 0.005). Between 0.86 and 0.93 gestation, Bmax was 1.45-fold greater in females than males (P less than 0.001). The dissociation constant of beta-receptors was not influenced significantly by gender or gestation. We conclude that maturation of pulmonary beta-receptors coincides with the onset of SAM flux in fetal lambs and that both mature more rapidly in females. We speculate that pulmonary beta-receptor maturation and SAM flux are coregulated by hormonal factors. More rapid maturation of pulmonary beta-receptors and SAM flux in females may be a factor in the female advantage with regard to pulmonary surfactant maturation and the survival of premature neonates.", 
    "73": "1 BRL 34915 (0.04-1.3 microM) caused concentration-dependent inhibition of spontaneous phasic spasms of the isolated uterus of the term pregnant rat and this effect was not antagonized by propranolol. Spasms evoked by low concentrations of KCl (less than 20 mM) were inhibited by BRL 34915 but those evoked by higher concentrations (greater than 40 mM) were unaffected. 2 In experiments using extracellular electrical recording, BRL 34915 (10 microM) selectively inhibited oxytocin-induced phasic spasms and the associated spike activity but had little effect on the tonic component of the spasms. BRL 34915, as an inhibitor of phasic spasms to oxytocin (0.2 nM), was antagonized by procaine (0.3 and 1 mM). 3 BRL 34915 (10 microM) did not inhibit Ca2+-induced spasm of saponin-skinned thin myometrial strips. 4 Intracellular microelectrode recording from myometrial strips showed that BRL 34915 (10 microM) inhibited action potentials and phasic spasms in the presence of oxytocin (0.2 nM) and produced a hyperpolarization of 5 mV. 5 In single myometrial cells under current or voltage clamp, BRL 34915 (10 microM) had no effect on action potentials and inward current in Ca2+- or Ba2+-containing media in the presence of tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine and caesium chloride. In the absence of these K+-channel inhibitors, BRL 34915 had no effect on resting membrane potential, membrane resistance, action potential, inward current or outward current. 6 BRL 34915 (1 or 10 microM) had no effect on 86Rb efflux from myometrial strips. 86Rb efflux was increased by oxytocin (0.2 and 20 nM). 7 The relaxant profile of BRL 34915 in the rat uterus is similar to that described for other smooth muscles where an action to open membrane K+-channels has been proposed. BRL 34915 inhibited spike production but produced only a small hyperpolarization without a detectable increase in 86Rb efflux. Membrane resistance and transmembrane currents were unaffected. These results suggest that in the uterus the effects of BRL 34915 may be restricted to K+-channels involved in the production of pacemaker activity.", 
    "74": "The effects of butyrate and retinoic acid in combination with catecholamines or histamine on the HN-1 human head and neck squamous carcinoma cell line were investigated analysing cell proliferation, placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) activity, and relative cytokeratin content. Butyrate inhibited cell proliferation in agar, whereas retinoic acid induced a small inhibitory effect. Butyrate enhanced PLAP activity in a time related manner in contrast to retinoic acid, which had no significant effect. However, retinoic acid inhibited the efficacy of butyrate to induce PLAP activity. A synergistic enhancement of PLAP activity was demonstrated after treatment of butyrate pretreated cells with catecholamines or histamine. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol partly inhibited the aforementioned enhancement of PLAP activity, whereas the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine further enhanced PLAP activity. Indirect labeling of keratins with a polyclonal antibody showed that cytokeratin content was enhanced by butyrate but not by retinoic acid. Further analysis of cytokeratin content using four monoclonal antibodies showed that labeling of cytokeratins (5 + 8) was increased by butyrate. PLAP activity could be modulated by a concerted action of either butyrate plus retinoic acid or butyrate plus catecholamines or histamine, indicating a possible role for PLAP in tumour cell proliferation.", 
    "75": "The cardioselectivities of five beta-adrenoceptor antagonists were compared. Six normal subjects received, in a double-blind random order, 200 mg acebutolol, 50 mg atenolol, 10 mg betaxolol, 100 mg metoprolol, 80 mg propranolol, and placebo. All beta-adrenoceptor antagonists produced a similar reduction in exercise tachycardia. Isoprenaline infusions in incremental doses were given. Dose-response curves were constructed and the doses of isoprenaline required to increase heart rate by 25 beats/min (I25), forearm blood flow by 3 ml/100 ml/min (IF3), and finger tremor by 200% (IT200), and decrease diastolic blood pressure by 25 mm Hg (ID25), after each treatment were compared. After propranolol, I25, ID25, IF3, and IT200 were greater (p less than 0.02) than after atenolol, betaxolol, and metoprolol; I25, ID25, and IT200 were greater than after acebutolol. After acebutolol I25, ID25, and IF3 were greater than after atenolol and betaxolol; IT200 was greater than after betaxolol. Atenolol and betaxolol caused less reduction in the isoprenaline-induced changes in blood glucose, plasma potassium, lactate, renin activity, and serum insulin than propranolol. Acebutolol caused less attenuation of blood glucose and plasma lactate, and metoprolol less attenuation of plasma renin activity, than propranolol. It is concluded that acebutolol, atenolol, betaxolol, and metoprolol cause less blockade of beta 2-adrenoceptors than propranolol, and atenolol and betaxolol are more cardioselective than acebutolol.", 
    "76": "The role of beta 1- and beta 2-receptors as modulators of coronary artery vasodilation was studied in the anesthetized dog. The left circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused under constant pressure with blood drawn from the right femoral artery. Coronary blood flow myocardial contractile force were measured with a cannulating electromagnetic flow probe and Walton-Brodie strain gauges, respectively. The left stellate ganglion was isolated distally, and the postganglionic nerves were stimulated with a bipolar electrode. Coronary artery blood flow and regional myocardial contractile force increased in response to stellate nerve stimulation and to the intracoronary administration of norepinephrine (NE), isoproterenol (ISO), and zinterol (ZIN) before selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade with celiprolol (0.3 mg/kg intravenously, i.v.). The administration of celiprolol inhibited the positive inotropic response to both stellate stimulation and to the intracoronary administration of the selected beta-adrenergic receptor agonists. The increase in coronary artery blood flow observed in response to stellate stimulation or to the intracoronary administration of NE was converted to a decrease in flow in the presence of celiprolol. In contrast, however, the intracoronary administration of ISO or ZIN continued to cause coronary vasodilation despite the presence of beta 1-selective adrenergic receptor blockade with celiprolol. Addition of propranolol (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) in the presence of celiprolol completely inhibited the increase in coronary blood flow in response to ISO and ZIN.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "The relationships between plasma drug concentrations and cardiovascular effects during combined administration of nifedipine and propranolol were evaluated in dogs anesthetized with thiopental. Three received small intravenous (i.v.) doses of nifedipine followed by propranolol, and 6 were given higher doses of nifedipine followed by propranolol; in 5, the order of drug doses was reversed, with propranolol administration followed by nifedipine. When dosing regimens that produced stable plasma levels of both drugs were used, the observed effects were closely related to the plasma concentrations of the individual agents. When small doses of nifedipine were combined with propranolol, at plasma levels associated with a significant degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, moderate decreases in spontaneous heart rate and cardiac output as well as increases in atrioventricular conduction time were produced. With higher doses of nifedipine, combined infusion with propranolol resulted in more pronounced depression in cardiac function, characterized by decreases in cardiac output, heart rate, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure, as well as increases in atrioventricular conduction time. When propranolol administration was followed by nifedipine, similar dose-dependent cardiovascular effects resulted, with profound toxicity apparent when large doses of nifedipine were used. These studies in an acute anesthetized dog model suggest that the magnitude of cardiovascular depression resulting from nifedipine and propranolol in combination is dependent on the plasma concentrations of both agents. Furthermore, in the presence of beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the direct effects of nifedipine on myocardial conducting tissue, which are usually absent when this calcium antagonist is given alone, may become apparent and result in depression of atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodal functions.", 
    "78": "The effects of a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity (pindolol) were assessed in the open-chest anaesthetised dog during 12-minute periods of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion and reperfusion before and after sympathetic stimulation. Regional myocardial catecholamine efflux, blood flow, and epicardial activation abnormalities were assessed in three groups. In a control group (n = 8), two periods of ischaemia resulted in reproducible intraexperimental changes in catecholamine responses, blood flow, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias. Intravenous (i.v.) pindolol (0.45 mg/kg before the second occlusion) reduced nerve-stimulated norepinephrine (NE) overflow from nonischaemic (NI) myocardium but did not modify overflow from ischaemic (I) myocardium either during ischaemia or reperfusion. At constant heart rate (atrial pacing, n = 8), pindolol reduced absolute blood flow to I and NI but had no effect on the ratio of endocardial/epicardial blood flow, arrhythmias, or activation abnormalities during occlusion. Following a reduction in heart rate of 32 +/- 6 beats/min (no pacing, n = 8), pindolol resulted in similar reduction in blood flow to I and NI but also increased the ratio of endocardial/epicardial flow and reduced both spontaneous arrhythmias and activation delay during occlusion. The acute effects of pindolol on conduction abnormalities, arrhythmias, and blood flow distribution in I are thus dependent on reduction in heart rate.", 
    "79": "Two mammalian tachykinins, substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA), were measured by radioimmunoassay in canine cephalic blood vessels and tested for their vasoactivity in vitro. Levels of immunoreactive SP were approximately 2-3 times greater than those of immunoreactive NKA in common carotid, basilar, and middle cerebral arteries. Both endogenous tachykinins relaxed precontracted segments of common carotid and basilar arteries in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 8.9 X 10(-11) M and 7 X 10(-10) M, respectively, when added cumulatively. Relaxation was endothelial dependent for both substances and not blocked or enhanced by pretreatment with indomethacin, propranolol, lithium chloride, or atropine. Neither SP nor NKA released 3H-inositol phosphates from phospholipid membranes of canine carotid segments after preincubation with 3H-inositol. SP but not NKA or the C-terminal fragments SP(4-11) caused desensitization to subsequent additions of itself but not to the relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside, calcitonin gene-related peptide, or bradykinin. These studies demonstrate that at least 2 peptides derived from beta-preprotachykinin are contained within cephalic blood vessels and that these products share similar vasoactive properties but differ in their ability to desensitize vascular tachykinin receptors.", 
    "80": "Cholinergic agents decrease myocardial contractility in part by inhibiting adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity. We have found that after a prolonged preincubation period (greater than 6 h), washout of cholinergic agents from embryonic chick hearts or cultured heart cells results in a persistent increase in their basal and catecholamine-stimulated cAMP content. Membranes prepared from pretreated cells have elevated basal, forskolin-, and catecholamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activities. This myocardial adaptation to cholinergic agents is analogous to changes in nerve cells and other cell types after prolonged exposures to narcotics or other inhibitors of adenylate cyclase, respectively. A rapid (less than 5 min) adaptation response to cholinergic agents can also be demonstrated in heart cells by quickly blocking agonist action with atropine. Atropine alone has no effect, but after a brief preincubation period with agonists (methacholine or oxotremorine), the addition of atropine transiently enhances catecholamine-stimulated cAMP accumulation by 2.5-fold. These responses are absent in heart cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. The data indicate that the response is not mediated by the phosphoinositide pathway, which has been demonstrated to be insensitive to pertussis toxin in chick heart. Enhanced cAMP accumulation after termination of muscarinic agonist action may provide an explanation for the observation that acetylcholine sometimes produces biphasic contractile responses.", 
    "81": "Twenty-four hour ambulatory electrocardiography was performed on 3,290 survivors of acute myocardial infarction participating in the Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT). History of myocardial infarction before the qualifying event, congestive heart failure and age were independently associated with the frequency and complexity of ventricular premature beats. Of the 1,640 patients randomized to placebo therapy, 163 died (76 suffered sudden death) during a 25 month average follow-up period. Ventricular ectopic activity was an independent predictor of total mortality after taking into consideration 16 other prognostic factors describing past history, risk factors, physical examination and laboratory investigations. Seven categoric definitions of ventricular ectopic activity predicted mortality, with similar odds ratios ranging from 2.27 to 2.69. A reciprocal relation of the sensitivity and specificity of each definition in predicting mortality was observed. Three clinical criteria (ST depression, cardiomegaly and prior infarction) allowed stratification of patients into four subsets with respective mortality rates of 35.5% (three criteria present), 19.0% (two criteria), 11.5% (one criterion) and 4.7% (none). Presence of ventricular ectopic activity (greater than or equal to 10 ventricular premature beats/h or pairs, ventricular tachycardia or multiform complexes) was associated with higher mortality rates in all four risk strata. The relative risk was higher (3.86) in the lowest risk stratum (mortality 2.4% without and 9.1% with ventricular ectopic activity). Thus, in survivors of acute myocardial infarction, ventricular ectopic activity was more pronounced in patients with prior myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. It predicted mortality independently of other factors. Although mortality ratios were similar for all seven arrhythmia definitions, a reciprocal relation between sensitivity and specificity of the definitions in predicting mortality existed; ventricular ectopic activity was associated with increased mortality in all risk strata, but with a higher risk ratio in the numerically larger, low risk subset.", 
    "82": "Cardiac chronotropic response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) was assessed in chick embryonic ventricular cell aggregates. EGF at a concentration of 10 ug/mL but not at 5 ug/mL produced a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in cardiac beating rate. This was evident within 10 min, reached a peak at about 15 min and remained at that level for 1.5 hr or the rest of the observation period. The effect of EGF on cardiac automaticity was reduced but not abolished at a lower temperature (22oC) that is known to decrease the affinity of the EGF receptor and reduce the internalization of EGF. Hypothermia did not change the maximum increase in heart rate response from isoproterenol although it altered the pattern of the response. Beta adrenoreceptor blockade with metoprolol only slightly altered the response to EGF. These data indicate that EGF produces functional effects on the heart that may be mediated through EGF receptor linked mechanisms.", 
    "83": "We examined the effects of atrial natriuretic polypeptide (hANP) on exocrine function in the isolated and blood-perfused dog pancreas in situ. Intra-arterial injection of hANP (1-10 micrograms) resulted in the dose-dependent increases of the pancreatic juice secretion. The secretory activity of 3 micrograms of hANP was approximately equal to one third of the secretory activity of 0.1 units of secretin. The use of hANP increased the concentration of bicarbonate but not that of sodium and protein in the pancreatic juice as compared with the basal values. These secretory responses to hANP were not inhibited by treatment with haloperidol, sulpiride, phentolamine, propranolol, atropine, cimetidine or ethacrynic acid. These results suggest that hANP acts directly on the pancreatic exocrine gland to stimulate pancreatic secretion; without, however, increasing sodium excretion. The mechanism of this effect remains to be elucidated.", 
    "84": "The effect of barium and potassium on the secretion and biosynthesis of enkephalin in bovine chromaffin cells, and prolactin and beta-endorphin in rat anterior pituitary cells, was examined to determine whether calcium-dependent secretion and biosynthesis are mediated by the same or by different calcium targets within the neuroendocrine cell. In the presence of 1.8 mM calcium, barium and potassium stimulated the secretion of all three peptides over 30 min, and increased the levels of proenkephalin and prolactin mRNA in 24 hr. These effects were inhibited by the calcium channel blocker D600. When the extracellular calcium concentration was lowered to 0.1 mM or less, secretion elicited by potassium was blocked, whereas secretion elicited by barium was enhanced, indicating that barium wholly substitutes for extracellular calcium in mediating peptide secretion. On the other hand, stimulation of proenkephalin and prolactin mRNA by both potassium and barium was inhibited when the extracellular calcium concentration was reduced. We conclude that calcium acts at two different intracellular targets to activate secretion versus biosynthesis of both enkephalin and prolactin. This appears to be the first report in which two different calcium-dependent processes in the intact cell are distinguished by a calcium ion agonist. Calcium-dependent processes such as protein phosphorylation, protein translocation, and enzyme activation may thus be related to events in the intact cell such as peptide synthesis and secretion on the basis of selective stimulation by barium."
