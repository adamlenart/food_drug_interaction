    "0": "The influence of the debrisoquine/sparteine-type of oxidation polymorphism on plasma bufuralol concentration and the pattern of urine metabolites was studied in extensive and poor metabolizer subjects. (+)- and (-)-bufuralol, and (+)- and (-)-OH-bufuralol in plasma were determined by enantioselective HPLC, and urinary bufuralol and its metabolites were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Three hours after administration of racemic bufuralol the plasma (-)/(+) isomeric ratio for unchanged bufuralol was 1.84 in extensive metabolizers, indicating preferential clearance of the (+)-isomer through aliphatic 1'-hydroxylation and glucuroconjugation, while the (-)-isomer was mainly eliminated by aromatic 4-hydroxylation. Poor metabolizers were characterized by impaired 1'- and 4-hydroxylation, with almost total abolition of the stereoselectivity of these reactions. The data strongly suggest that both 1'- and 4-hydroxylation are catalyzed by the same enzyme. These in vivo observations are in agreement with recent in vitro data obtained in human liver microsomes from phenotyped patients and support the concept of deficiency of a highly stereoselective cytochrome P-450 isozyme as the cause of this polymorphism.", 
    "1": "In 6 healthy volunteers the pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol under steady-state conditions was investigated over three consecutive phases: over 7 days of 10 mg of bisoprolol once daily per os, 7 days of 10 mg of bisoprolol once daily plus 400 mg of cimetidine t.i.d. and 14 days of 10 mg of bisoprolol and 600 mg of rifampicin once daily with adequate intervals free of medication. After therapy with bisoprolol alone peak plasma levels (Cssmax) of the beta-blocker were 55.5 +/- 6.4 ng/ml (means +/- SEM), area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC tau) was 597 +/- 70 ng/ml.h, total body clearance (CL) 15.8 +/- 1.8 l/h and elimination half-lives (t1/2 beta) 10.1 +/- 1.2 h. Cimetidine did not cause any significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol. Co-administration of rifampicin resulted in a decrease in Cssmax (43.0 +/- 6.9 ng/ml), AUC tau (397 +/- 54 ng/ml X h) and t1/2 beta (6.2 +/- 0.4 h). Accordingly, total body clearance increased to 23.8 +/- 2.5 l/h (p less than 0.05). In conclusion bisoprolol showed a statistically significant but probably clinically not important interaction with the enzyme-inducing drug rifampicin, but not with the enzyme inhibitor cimetidine.", 
    "2": "Flusoxolol (Ro 31-1411) is the pharmacologically active optical isomer of Ro 31-1118, a potent cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. It was given to 6 healthy volunteers in a single dose, 40 mg, and then in multiple doses, 40 mg daily for 8 days. Plasma concentration data were best described by a linear two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first order absorption, and the results confirmed linear kinetics. Pharmacokinetic data for flusoxolol were comparable to those for the racemate Ro 31-1118.", 
    "3": "The acute effects of bisoprolol 10 mg i.v., a new beta1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist, on heart rate, mean blood pressure (mBP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), para-aminohippuric acid clearance (CPAH), sodium clearance, urine volume and plasma renin activity (PRA), were studied in 6 patients with essential hypertension. Heart rate decreased by 23%, mBP remained unchanged, and GFR decreased by 14% and CPAH by 23%. PRA was depressed on average by 25%. Urine volume and sodium clearance also declined by 9 and 13%, respectively, but the changes were not statistically significant. The fall in heart rate was significantly correlated with that in GFR and CPAH. Changes in GFR were correlated significantly with those in CPAH. The acute changes in renal function induced by bisoprolol are considered to be due to a reduction in cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance.", 
    "4": "The finger systolic pressure of 25 healthy subjects and 23 hypertensives was studied by plethysmography at 30 degrees, 15 degrees and 10 degrees centigrade. The hypertensive group was given equipotent doses of either Metoprolol or Propranolol in accordance with a double-blind cross-over protocol including a washout period. The fall in systolic pressure between the brachial artery in the upper arm and the digital artery was significantly increased in the hypertensive group as compared to healthy controls; the rise persisted under hot and hyperemic conditions and remained constant during both betablocker treatments. In the hypertensive group digital arterial tone increased under cold conditions before any treatment; this abnormality did not vary under Metoprolol but intensified significantly under Propranolol. Finger plethysmography made it possible to show and quantify the peripheral vascular repercussions of hypertension on the digital artery and evaluate the changes induced by treatments. It also helps to clarify the physiopathology of certain side effects caused by betablockers and might to some extent help in the choice and the survey of treatment and in the subsequent follow-up.", 
    "5": "The pharmacokinetics of bevantolol were examined following single and repeated oral doses to young and elderly volunteers. Following administration of a single 200-mg bevantolol tablet mean maximum plasma bevantolol concentrations in young and elderly subjects were 1690 ng/ml and 1810 ng/ml, respectively. Maximum bevantolol concentrations occurred approximately 1.1 h postdose in both young and elderly subjects. There were no significant differences in mean steady state bevantolol concentrations on Day 14 between young and elderly subjects. However, disproportionate increases in Cmax, and in AUC, but not in tmax values were observed between Days 1 and 14. On Days 1 and 14, most young and elderly subjects exhibited monoexponential decline in bevantolol plasma concentrations after absorption phase. In those subjects Day 14 elimination half-lives in young and elderly were 1.9 and 2.2 h, respectively. In subjects who exhibited biexponential decline in bevantolol, an age effect in elimination became apparent, on Day 14 elimination half-lives were 5.7 and 11.2 h in young and elderly subjects, respectively. Bevantolol Metabolite III concentrations were observed in plasma of some subjects during the first 6 h after dosing. At steady-state AUC (0-ldc) values for the metabolite were less than 2% those of bevantolol. Bevantolol plasma levels accumulate to a small extent with repeated 200 mg daily doses. This is probably due to the contribution of a late and more persistent terminal elimination phase that was discernable in only certain individuals.", 
    "6": "The acute and chronic effects of pinacidil on blood pressure (BP) and renal function were investigated in 10 patients with moderate arterial hypertension insufficiently controlled by chronic beta-blockade. Acute i.v. administration of pinacidil caused a significant fall in BP of 29.9/18.3 mm Hg and, despite beta-blockade, a concomitant rise in heart rate (HR) of 21%. Renal vascular resistance (RVR) showed a marked reduction as a consequence of the fall in BP, and a transient rise in renal plasma flow (RPF). Diuresis and renal clearance of sodium and uric acid showed a parallel fall. The excretion rates of albumin and beta 2-microglobulin were also significantly reduced. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that glomerular filtration was responsible for elimination of the parent drug, and that proximal tubular secretion was the pathway of excretion of the main metabolite, pinacidil pyridine-N-oxide. During therapy for 4 months there was no further significant reduction in BP, despite increases in the daily dose of pinacidil. The effects on HR were less conspicuous after 4 months; renal haemodynamic parameters and body weight were not significantly changed. The initial level of RVR and the initial acute reduction in this parameter appeared to be major determinants of the long-term BP response. The drug was well tolerated apart from one patient who developed slight fluid retention. However, concomitant administration of a diuretic will probably be necessary during routine use of this therapeutic combination.", 
    "7": "The authors investigated parameters of the sinus rhythm and of the structure of physiological sleep in 11 cats after ligation of the interventricular artery. ECG of the cerebral cortex, electromyogram, electrooculogram, ECG and respiration were registered, both in the acute period of infarction (4th-10th day of the experiment) and in the subacute and late period (3-12 months). In the acute and subacute period, an abrupt decrease was found in the sinus rhythm variability during the waking-sleep cycle. Propranolol administration (10 mg/kg) reduced in intact animals the heart rate, especially during wakefulness, and the rhythm variability during wakefulness and sleep. Suppression of sinus rhythm automatism due to propranolol in animals with experimental MI was most pronounced in the acute period during REM sleep, in the subacute period during wakefulness. In the acute period of MI, the sleep structure was disorganized, in the subacute period it got partly normalized. Protracted propranolol administration in the subacute period of MI led to disturbances in the sleep structure, with reduced REM sleep and prolongation of stage I-II (superficial sleep).", 
    "8": "A number of recent studies have failed to show the expected effect that aggressive antihypertensive therapy can contribute to the primary prevention of morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease. Although antihypertensive agents effectively lower blood pressure, their ability to increase other cardiovascular risk factors may modify or even outweigh the beneficial effect gained from blood pressure control alone. In view of the vast population of patients with mild to moderate hypertension that might be treated, it is important that treatment of hypertension have as little adverse effect as possible on other risk factors. Current investigations have revealed that thiazide diuretics raise total cholesterol levels, while beta-blockers raise triglyceride and lower high-density lipoprotein levels. Thus both drugs tend to worsen the patient's serum lipid profile. Diuretics also decrease renal perfusion and increase serum glucose and uric acid concentrations. Beta-blockers have been shown to decrease exercise capacity and left ventricular performance. It is apparent, therefore, that even with a beneficial reduction of blood pressure, these drugs may have undesirable effects as well, thus tainting the expected clinical benefit. For example, data from the Framingham study indicate that a persistent increase of 10 to 20 mg/dl in total serum cholesterol largely offsets the protection from coronary heart disease afforded by a 10- to 15-mmHg reduction in blood pressure. Alpha 1-blocking agents, in contrast, appear to have desirable effects on many of the risk factors. The use of antihypertensive agents that do not adversely affect coronary heart disease risk factors, coupled with nonpharmacological measures such as diet and exercise, appears to be the best approach to therapy in hypertensive patients.", 
    "9": "The influence of a once daily dose of 200 mg celiprolol alone and in combination with 12.5 mg chlorthalidone on uric acid and electrolyte metabolism was investigated in 22 hypertensive patients with gout in a randomized trial. All patients were treated with allopurinol and diet. A four weeks treatment with celiprolol (11 patients) showed no influence on uric acid metabolism, electrolytes, blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Under treatment with celiprolol plus chlorthalidone (11 patients) only a small rise in serum uric acid was observed after four weeks but at the same time uric acid clearance and excretion increased significantly. There was no obvious change in serum electrolytes but an increase in sodium, potassium and chloride urine excretion. Serum uric acid, uric acid clearance and excretion decreased during a 6 months treatment period. A small decrease in cholesterol and triglycerides was observed. Blood pressure decreased in both treatment groups but there was only a small change in heart rate.", 
    "10": "We studied biochemically the effects of pindolol, befunolol and melanin treated with beta-blockers on lysosomal enzymes in the ammonium sulfate fraction of the bovine ciliary body and iris in vitro. Acid phosphatase, beta-D-glucuronidase and alpha-D-mannosidase were not inhibited by the beta-blockers. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase and alpha-L-fucosidase activities were inhibited by pindolol and befunolol at high concentrations. After centrifugation of the enzyme fraction incubated with melanin, the enzyme activity in the supernatant decreased, possibly as a result of the affinity of lysosomal enzymes to melanin. When melanin was first treated with pindolol or befunolol, some lysosomal enzyme activities increased in the supernatant after removing the melanin, depending on the concentration of the beta-blocking agent. This increased activity may result from the loss of affinity of lysosomal enzymes to melanin caused by the beta-blocking agent.", 
    "11": "The study was a comparison of the effects on respiratory function produced by four antihypertensive agents with receptor-blocking properties (atenolol, oxprenolol, labetalol, metoprolol), when used in combination with a diuretic (chlorthalidone) in four homogeneous groups of hypertensive patients also suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease. All the agents with the exception of labetalol caused systematic and considerable worsening of functional parameters monitored in the trial. Treatment with labetalol, on the other hand, led to an improvement in respiratory function. Labetalol thus proved to be the most reliable and selective of the drugs tested for administration to patients with severe chronic airflow limitation.", 
    "12": "We report on 29 treatment courses in 25 children aged 1.5-18 years who received captopril because of severe renal hypertension. The mean initial dosage was 1.3 (0.5 to 3) mg/kg/day and the mean sustaining dose 2.2 mg/kg/day. The treatment was followed for 2-40 (mean 15) months. We observed a lowering of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) from 26% at the 2nd day to 65% at the 6th month. The isolated use of captopril was ineffective in 13% of cases, but blood pressure dropped in all of them after addition of beta blocking agents. No clear-cut relation was found between response of blood pressure and etiology, degree of HT or plasma renin activity (PRA). No side effects occurred during treatment except for one case of reversible acute renal failure in a transplanted patient with renal artery stenosis.", 
    "13": "New knowledge of the pathophysiology of coronary disease has helped determine the therapy for angina pectoris. Calcium antagonists have the advantage of being direct coronary vasodilators as well as decreasing overall demand by systemic vasodilatation. Verapamil has the same anti-anginal effect during exercise as beta-adrenoceptor blockers but has the advantage of increasing rather than decreasing the cardiac output and so fatigue both at rest and exercise commonly seen with beta-adrenoceptor blockers is not found with verapamil. The longterm incidence of side-effects with verapamil are few and it can be used as a single anti-anginal therapy in a three times daily dosage. Left ventricular function where normal and near-normal is not depressed. Tolerance to therapy has not been recorded. The anti-anginal effects have been shown to remain effective over at least a 5 year period. Verapamil should be considered as initial therapy for patients with stable angina pectoris.", 
    "14": "Verapamil and nifedipine enhance the hypotensive and anti-anginal effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The combination of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs with nifedipine may pose fewer safety problems than the combination with verapamil especially in ischaemic heart disease when left ventricular function is suspect. Verapamil as a single agent may be as effective as a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug in angina and provide a suitable alternative. Careful supervision is required when verapamil is combined with beta-adrenoceptor blockers for both angina and hypertension but reported clinical problems in hypertension are few.", 
    "15": "Myocardial contractility of the rabbit ventricle, expressed as contractility index KI = d log (p - p0)/dtmax, was altered by both aortic nerve reflex stimulation and by beta-receptor blockade with propranolol (Obsidan) and talinolol (Cordanum, (+)-Cordanum and (-)-Cordanum). In every case, beta-receptor blockade decreased negative reflex inotropy, whereas reflex hypotension was only reduced by Obsidan. The mean reflex inotropy was 11.8% after Obsidan application and 17.3% after Cordanum injection, the reflex hypotension 28.0% and 34.8%. From the results it is concluded that Cordanum acts in the rabbit ventricle cardioselectively. If neural and pharmacological effects are related to initial effects, we may conclude that the contractile state maintained by the resting sympathetic tone is diminished. The overall reduction of KI by Cordanum blockade and reflex inhibition amounts to 45.5%, that of blood pressure to 42%. Its optical isomers act also cardioselectively, the inotropic effects, however, are smaller than those of the racemate. Obviously, reflex stimulation and beta 1-blocking agents have a similar mode of inotropic action. From this we suggest that reflex inotropy is mediated by sympathetic nerve fibres and beta 1-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "16": "Calcium concentration was reduced by 51 per cent compared with unstimulated contralateral glands after 60-min of electrical stimulation to the sympathetic nerve. When the alpha-adrenergic antagonists, phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine, were given 20 min before stimulation, the decrease in glandular calcium concentration (45-47 per cent) was similar to that after nerve stimulation alone; with the selective beta 2-adrenergic antagonist added to the phentolamine, the percentage decrease was similar to that found after phentolamine and sympathetic nerve stimulation only. When atenolol, a beta 1-adrenergic antagonist, was given with phentolamine, there was no secretion after subsequent nerve stimulation, nor was calcium concentration different from that of unstimulated glands. When propranolol (3 mg/kg, body wt), or atenolol + butoxamine (3 mg/kg, body wt), was given prior to stimulation there was a decrease of 21-22 per cent in gland-calcium concentration. Calcium concentration of nerve-stimulated saliva was nearly 6 m-equiv./l, and twice as high with phentolamine prior to stimulation; for butoxamine together with phentolamine the change was similar to that with phentolamine alone. When beta-adrenergic antagonists were given prior to nerve stimulation, concentration of the saliva was either unchanged (propranolol) from that with nerve stimulation alone or somewhat decreased (atenolol + butoxamine). Thus sympathetic stimulation results in activation of alpha and beta 1-adrenoceptors; calcium secretion is principally regulated by the beta-adrenoceptors, and beta 1-receptors have the principal role.", 
    "17": "Imipramine (IMI) was administered s.c. at 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats on gestation days 8-20 to assess possible alterations in postnatal heart and brain development. Maternal weight gain was significantly reduced in a dose-response manner, but litter size and pup weight on postnatal day (PND) 1 were unaffected. On PND 1, litters were culled to 10 pups for analysis on PNDs 4/5, 7/8, 14/15, and 21/22. Pup body weight was not affected at any age measured, but heart weight was significantly reduced at 10 mg/kg IMI on PNDs 4/5 and 7/8. Brain weight was increased in a dose-related pattern on PNDs 4/5 and 7/8 and was significantly higher at 5 mg/kg IMI on PND 14/15. No significant effect was observed in heart or brain protein and DNA content or in cardiac beta-adrenergic receptor concentration. Prenatal IMI exposure had no effect on basal cardiac ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme associated with growth and development, but basal brain ODC was lower at 5 mg/kg IMI at all ages measured. Cardiac ODC stimulation by insulin was unaffected by prenatal exposure to IMI, but isoproterenol-stimulated ODC was increased on PND 21/22 at 5 mg/kg IMI. In conclusion, the IMI-related changes in several parameters suggest that when maternal IMI treatment is used, alterations in postnatal heart and brain development must be considered as possible outcomes.", 
    "18": "Catecholamines stimulate Na,K-ATPase activity in the microsomal membranes of the brain and brown adipose tissue. This stimulation is apparent in the absence of soluble, cytosolic inhibitors and exhibits the same characteristics in both tissues: it occurs at high concentrations (10(-6)-10(-4) M) only; there is no difference in potency between isoprenaline, norepinephrine and epinephrine (EC50 = 1-2 X 10(-5) M); the D-stereoisomer of isoprenaline is equally as effective as the L-form; stimulation of Na,K-ATPase may also be achieved by the metal chelators EDTA, EGTA and desferal; the hydrophobic beta-blockers, propranolol and alprenolol, inhibit both the norepinephrine-stimulated and basal levels of enzyme activity at concentrations of 10(-5)-10(-3) M; phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible alpha-adrenergic blocker, inhibits basal Na,K-ATPase as well as norepinephrine-stimulated enzyme activity (EC50 = 2.5 X 10(-5) M). Because none of these observations can be related to the properties of the stereospecific adrenergic receptor (alpha or beta), it may be concluded that the catecholamine-Na,K-ATPase interaction is not mediated by the receptor. More probably, catecholamines may antagonize the Na,K-ATPase inhibition caused by some tightly membrane-bound metals (but not vanadium) via the ortho-catechol moiety of the catecholamine molecule. The stimulation of brown fat Na,K-ATPase by catecholamines does not have much relevance to the norepinephrine-stimulated thermogenesis in this tissue.", 
    "19": "In the search for new effective positive inotropic agents for the treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF), interest has focused mainly on two groups of agents namely adrenoceptor agonists and drugs inhibiting phosphodiesterase. Common for drugs belonging to both groups is that their positive inotropic effects seem to involve an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP. Drugs acting by stimulation of beta 1- and/or beta 2-adrenoceptors (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine, prenalterol, pirbuterol, salbutamol, terbutaline, fenoterol) have initial beneficial effects, but seem to be ineffective for long-term treatment. This has been suggested to be due to desensitization of the beta-adrenoceptors, and means, if this effect can be definitely established, that beta-adrenoceptor stimulation should be restricted to the acute treatment of CHF. Among drugs inhibiting phosphodiesterase, sulmazole, amrinone, milrinone, and fenoximone all have been shown to improve cardiac performance in patients with CHF during short-term treatment. However, results of long-term treatment with most of these drugs seem less encouraging. It has been suggested that these drugs may not be an effective approach to treatment of patients with CHF, since even if it is possible to achieve short-term gains, the long-term effects on the myocardium may be detrimental. Their ultimate place in the treatment of CHF remains to be established.", 
    "20": "On the basis of clinical, electrophysiological, psychologic and vegetative parameters, the authors treated 66 patients with vegetovascular crises of neurotic nature using acupuncture, beta-adrenoblockers, psychotropic means and a combination of beta-adrenoblockers with psychotropic drugs. Acupuncture led to changes in all the aforegoing parameters. Psychotropic therapy reduced activating influences, predominantly in the \"ascending\" direction, anaprilin led to the maximum inhibition of the vegetative component of the crisis. With all methods of treatment emotional-personality alterations showed the greatest degree of normalization. This confirms the correctness of the term \"psycho-vegetative\" syndrome which emphasizes the leading role of mental disorders in the genesis of vegetovascular dystonia in neurotic patients.", 
    "21": "Maternal propranolol (PRO) treatment has previously been associated with adverse effects on the fetus and neonate. In the present study, pregnant rats were treated with PRO (25 or 50 mg/kg/day s.c.) on gestation days 8-20 to assess its possible effects on the developing heart. Maternal weight gain and pup weight on postnatal day (PND) 1 were reduced in a dose-dependent manner; litter size was unaffected. Pup body weight and heart weight both showed a dose-related decrease at all ages tested (PNDs 5/6, 8/9, 15/16, and 22/23). Since heart protein, but not DNA, was similarly reduced, the decrease seen in heart weight most likely reflects a decrease in cell size instead of cell number. Basal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme associated with growth and development, was unaffected by maternal PRO treatment. Insulin and isoproterenol stimulation of ODC, suggested markers for testing the function of the sympathetic pathway to the heart and of the heart's ODC response system, respectively, also showed no PRO-related response. In conclusion, prenatal PRO exposure resulted in reduced body weight, heart weight, and heart protein, but had little effect on heart DNA or ODC activity. Since PRO treatment also reduced maternal weight gain, the adverse effects seen in the pups may be due to generalized PRO toxicity. The results suggest that when high PRO doses were used clinically, the careful monitoring of maternal weight gain during pregnancy might be useful in predicting adverse fetal effects.", 
    "22": "A study was made of the results of surgery of 37 patients and conservative therapy of 90 patients (including 53 inoperable cases) with coronary heart disease with the involvement of the left main coronary artery. Lethality in a long-term period was 16.2% in the operated patients and 45.6% in the inoperable patients. A considerable improvement of the status with the lessening or disappearance of angina attacks was noted in 27 operated patients (87%), a stable improvement of ECG at rest and a considerable increase in exercise tolerance were noted in 11 patients. There was no considerable improvement of the status in the inoperable patients, a slight decrease in the number of attacks was noted in 22% of the patients only, impairment of ECG at rest was noted in 52%, exercise tolerance decreased in most of the patients. In the operated patients the 7-year survival rates according to actuarial curves were 81%, in the operable but receiving conservative therapy 47% and in the inoperable patients 34%.", 
    "23": "Raised function of platelets with an increase in their aggregation activity in vitro and an increase in spontaneous intravascular activation as well as imbalance of the prostacyclin-thromboxane system with a shift to the predominance of proaggregation agents were detected in CHD patients after myocardial infarction suffering from stable angina. An inhibiting effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and acetylsalicylic acid on the synthesis of thromboxane A2 was observed. No marked effect of dipyridamole on the prostacyclin-thromboxane system was noted.", 
    "24": "The beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist [3H]-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) has been used to label adrenoreceptors in membranes from human pregnant myometrium and placenta. Six tocolytic drugs were tested for their ability to bind to the beta-adrenergic receptor of placental and myometrial membranes. Tocolytic agents competed with [3H]-DHA binding in the following order of potency: clenbuterol greater than fenoterol greater than ritodrine greater than isoxsuprine greater than orciprenaline greater than terbutaline. All drugs competed for [3H]-DHA binding sites with HILL coefficients greater than unity indicating heterogeneity of binding. In general, binding of beta-adrenoreceptor agonists was weaker in myometrium than in placenta homogenates. According to our results it is very likely that the placenta may play an important role in the pharmacological mechanism of tocolytic agents in inhibitory of premature labor.", 
    "25": "The pharmacokinetics of the new beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug bevantolol and some aspects of its beta-blocking effect have been studied in healthy volunteers. Bevantolol had a short serum half-life (86 +/- 33 min) and high systemic availability after oral administration. The observed changes in heart rate, systolic blood pressure during exercise and plasma renin activity were all compatible with beta-adrenoceptor blockade. After 200 mg p.o. in the morning, the effects lasted for less than 24 h.", 
    "26": "This study examines and compares the hemodynamic and sympathoadrenal response to bicycle exercise in hypertensive subjects during two weeks' treatment with a cardio-selective (metoprolol) and nonselective (propranolol) beta-blocker. The increase in plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentration following exercise was augmented to a similar degree with each beta-blocker. Pre-exercise blood pressure and heart rate were similar for the two drugs. However immediately after exercise and particularly after resting for 20 min post exercise, diastolic blood pressure was lower during metoprolol treatment. Systolic blood pressure was also lower 20 min post exercise during metoprolol treatment. These observations indicate that cardio-selective beta-blockers offer advantages in blood pressure control during exercise through intact vascular beta 2-adrenoceptors opposing sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction.", 
    "27": "Chronotropic and dromotropic responses to treadmill exercise were compared in conscious dogs prior to and following excision of the sinoatrial node (SAN). The initial junctional rhythm accompanying removal of the SAN region was replaced within hours to days by subsidiary atrial pacemaker (SAP) foci located in the inferior right atrium along the sulcus terminalis. With SAN intact, cardiac acceleration was immediate at onset of exercise and the tachycardia was directly proportional to work intensity. Atrioventricular (AV) conduction concurrently accelerated during exercise as manifest by shortening in P-R and atrioventricular (A-V) intervals. Following SAN excision, subsidiary atrial pacemaker foci likewise demonstrated prompt tachycardias during exercise, although heart rate was significantly reduced at rest and during steady state exercise. In the SAP state, tachycardia during exercise was related to work intensity and was mediated by changes in cardiac autonomic nerve activity. Combined propranolol-atropine blockade increased heart rate at rest in the SAP state, and significantly attenuated the tachycardia accompanying treadmill exercise. Following SAN excision the P-R (A-V) interval was significantly reduced in the resting animal. In response to exercise, AV conduction time decreased in the SAP state, though the absolute levels during steady state exercise were not significantly different from prior control runs with SAN intact. Blood pressure response to exercise was similar during both SAN and SAP states. We conclude that following an initial unstable period, SAP foci maintain adequate heart rate increases in response to dynamic exercise, primarily mediated via autonomic nerve regulation.", 
    "28": "In the control of chronic disease no therapeutic regimen is successful unless it is complied with. A number of studies have indicated that compliance with tablet-taking may be as low as 40%. Patients with hypertension are frequently on a number of different anti-hypertensive agents, and if they have other chronic disorders they may take as many as 10 different drugs and up to 40 tablets per day. It is therefore not surprising that compliance is poor. To achieve compliance requires education of the patient, reduction in the number of drugs and simplification of the drug regimen. Methyldopa was used in a crossover study on a once- or twice-daily basis. Blood pressure was measured at the same time each day 2 hours after the morning dose. Compliance was assessed by tablet count and by blood pressure control, which was better on once-a-day therapy. Over a 6-week period 95% of medication was taken on the once-daily compared with 84% on the twice-daily regimen. In a subsequent study atenolol once per day replaced propranolol given 3 times per day. Blood pressure was lower on atenolol and tablet compliance was 94% compared with 74% on thrice-daily propranolol therapy. In addition, many patients admitted not taking the midday dose. The effect of dietary advice was then monitored by 24-hour urine electrolytes. When advice was given superficially by the doctor, urine sodium fell from 186 mmol/day to 165 mmol/day. When seen on one occasion by a dietitian and given diet sheets, it fell from 182 to 135 mmol/day. When seen at repeated visits by the dietitian and the advice modified according to sodium excretion, urine sodium excretion fell from 188 to 83 mmol/day. Supplemental oral potassium is often given as antihypertensive medication and up to 6 tablets per day may be administered. Compliance decreased as the number of tablets increased. Compliance was 92% on 1 tablet, 83% on 2 tablets, 68% on 3 tablets, 75% on 4 tablets (usually taken as 2 tablets twice a day) and 58% when on 6 tablets per day. The compliance with diuretic-taking was 96%. When given amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide the compliance was 93% and this elevated plasma potassium more than high dose supplemental potassium. In a recent study people on 3 or more drugs for blood pressure control were placed on a low salt diet and their drugs replaced with enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "29": "Endralazine and hydralazine were compared in a randomized double-blind, parallel group study lasting 1 year in 30 patients with essential hypertension inadequately controlled by a beta-blocker and a diuretic. Dosage ranged from 10 mg to 30 mg endralazine per day and from 75 mg to 200 mg hydralazine per day according to patient response. The results showed that endralazine was at least as effective as hydralazine in reducing blood pressure. Patients' tolerance, assessed by drop-out rate, was significantly better (p less than 0.05) in the endralazine group. No cases were found of drug-induced lupus-like syndrome on endralazine as opposed to 2 cases with hydralazine. The dose of endralazine required much less adjustment than that of hydralazine.", 
    "30": "The effect of selective alpha adrenergic agonists and antagonists on osmotic water permeability (Posm) across isolated skins of Bufo arenarum toads was investigated. Clonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, inhibited basal Posm and oxytocin, isoproterenol and theophylline stimulated Posm, but did not alter the hydrosmotic effect of exogenous cAMP. Blockade of the effect of clonidine on basal and stimulated Posm by the selective alpha-2 antagonist yohimbine supports the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect is mediated by the stimulation of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "31": "Two frequently used automated, blood pressure monitors, the Arteriosonde and the Dinamap, were compared with each other and with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer. Fifteen patients with elevated blood pressure were studied: 5 were untreated, 5 received a diuretic alone, and 5 received a beta blocker alone. One hundred and twenty blood pressure measurements were taken from each subject with two different instruments (one on each arm) in a 2 (supine or standing position) X 2 (left or right arm) X 3 (three different sets of pairwise instrument comparisons) X 5 (five one-minute interval measurements per phase) factorial design. A reasonable inter-instrument comparability for systolic blood pressure was found with mean deviations of +1.3 mmHg and -3.8 mmHg from the mercury sphygmomanometer for the Dinamap and Arteriosonde, respectively. Differences between instruments for diastolic pressure however, were significantly larger. The Arteriosonde systematically obtained higher diastolic pressure values (+7.4 mmHg) than the mercury sphygmomanometer or the Dinamap (10.7 mmHg). Diastolic pressure on the Dinamap was on average 5.2 mmHg lower than on the mercury sphygmomanometer. Left/right arm differences and differences for the treatment conditions were not observed. Findings clearly suggest that these two automated blood pressure monitors cannot be used interchangeably with each other or with the mercury sphygmomanometer in either a research or clinical setting. Overall the Dinamap approached mercury sphygmomanometer measures more closely than did the Arteriosonde.", 
    "32": "The present guidelines were endorsed by the participants at the Fourth Mild Hypertension Conference, held at K\u00f6nigstein, Federal Republic of Germany, on 4-7 December 1985. They include the definition of mild hypertension, and describe blood pressure measurement, factors influencing the decision to begin treatment, methods of treatment, and follow-up. These guidelines are a revision of those produced in 1982; they are based on the best available scientific evidence, and will be updated in the future to keep abreast of further developments in this field.", 
    "33": "We evaluated the ocular comfort of 0.5% levobunolol hydrochloride and 0.6% metipranolol hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions in a randomized, double-masked, paired-comparison clinical trial. The drugs were given twice daily for 7 days to 16 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Patients rated comfort in terms of the severity of burning and/or stinging. For both drugs, the severity rating of ocular discomfort was low, averaging between 1 and 2 on a scale of 0-10. At initial and follow-up visits, the mean severity rating of burning or stinging with metipranolol was 2, slightly greater than the mean score of 1 with levobunolol. At 55% (26 of 47) of the patient visits, the patients rated levobunolol as more comfortable than metipranolol. Metipranolol (Betamann; Mann) was rated as more comfortable than levobunolol at only 9% (4 of 47) of the patient visits. The duration of burning and stinging was also rated as longer lasting with metipranolol treatment than with levobunolol (Vistagan; Pharma-Allergan) treatment. Although little ocular discomfort was reported for either drug, the majority of the patients tested rated levobunolol the more comfortable of the two drugs.", 
    "34": "This study was designed to investigate beta-adrenergic-mediated extrarenal potassium disposal in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Plasma potassium was measured over a period of 3 months in 20 patients with ESRD who were receiving the nonselective beta-blocker propranolol (n = 10) or not (n = 10). Both groups were virtually anuric and had a comparable plasma BUN, plasma bicarbonate, and red cell Na-K-ATPase activity. Plasma potassium measured before dialysis was higher in propranolol users than in nonusers (5.6 +/- 0.2 and 4.6 +/- 0.1 mEq/l, p less than 0.005). To examine beta-adrenergic-mediated internal potassium disposal more directly, epinephrine and epinephrine plus propranolol were acutely administered to another group of patients with ESRD and to normal subjects. Epinephrine resulted in a similar fall in plasma potassium in both groups (0.69 +/- 0.20 and 0.63 +/- 0.07 mEq/l, respectively), thereby suggesting unimpaired beta-adrenergic-mediated extrarenal potassium handling in patients with ESRD. In patients, however, the response to epinephrine was heterogeneous. In 4 of the 10 patients studied, epinephrine infusion did not result in a decrement in plasma potassium suggesting impaired beta-adrenergic responsiveness and thus blunting of this mechanism of extrarenal potassium disposal. In the remaining 6 patients, epinephrine infusion resulted in a fall in plasma potassium which was greater than that observed in normal subjects (1.13 +/- 0.14 and 0.63 +/- 0.07 mEq/l, respectively, p less than 0.01). In the presence of propranolol, the infusion of epinephrine did not result in a decrement in plasma potassium in these 6 patients or in the 6 normal subjects (0.04 +/- 0.07 and -0.02 +/- 0.06 mEq/l, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The association between idiopathic mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and latent tetany (LT) is common, as shown in our previous studies on adults and children. On the basis of our experience with the effects of magnesium salts and/or beta-blockers on the symptoms of such patients, we tried to determine whether this therapy could also modify the left ventricular hyperkinesia (LVH) constantly associated with MVP. After showing the failure of short-term therapy (1-3 months), we found 12 cases treated for more than 1 year, having MVP, LVH and LT. The mean duration of this continuous therapy was 36.5 months (range 12-72 months). 5 men and 7 women (mean age 49; range 28-70) received magnesium salts (pyrrolidone carboxylate 4.5 g/day, lactate 3 g/day) either alone (2 cases) or associated with a beta-blocker (atenolol 100 mg/day, acebutolol 200-400 mg/day, propranolol, 40-160 mg/day; 10 cases). The erythrocyte magnesium was measured before, during and after therapy. All these 12 patients had repeat echocardiography at the end of the treatment. MVP was still present, as was LVH, in 50% of them. Mean erythrocyte magnesium was below the normal range before therapy (43 +/- 6.3 mg/l) and in the normal range after therapy (50.8 +/- 7 mg/l). But no relationship was found between the increase in erythrocyte magnesium and the disappearance or persistence of MVP and LVH. Therefore, the improvement of the patients' clinical status was not always followed by a significant change in erythrocyte magnesium values and in echocardiographic findings, even after long-term therapy.", 
    "36": "The high affinity beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)[125I]iodopindolol was used to characterize and quantitate beta-adrenergic binding in liver and other tissues of the rat. Saturable, stereospecific binding with typical characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors was demonstrated in all tissues examined (liver, lung, heart, kidney, fat and brain). Unlike the case with other radioactive ligands that have been used to measure beta-adrenergic receptors, assays were possible in crude homogenates as well as in purified membranes. Specific binding was defined as [125I]iodopindolol displaced by 0.1 mM isoproterenol. The percentage of [125I]iodopindolol specifically bound was greater than with other labelled antagonist ligands and it ranged from 95-60% of total binding over [125I]iodopindolol concentrations of 15-1000 pM. beta-Adrenergic binding could be quantitated in liver of animals of all ages whereas previously quantitation in liver was possible only using rats less than 2 months of age. Binding capacities ranged from a low of approximately 6 fmol/mg in liver particles precipitated at 4500 g to approximately 550 fmol/mg in 4500 g lung particles. The Kd of binding obtained by kinetic analysis was similar in all tissues. [125I]Iodopindolol is a nearly ideal ligand for the quantitation of beta-adrenergic receptors in various tissues of the rat. Because of its high affinity, stability and availability at high specific activity, this ligand should be especially useful in physiological studies requiring the accurate quantitation of receptor capacities.", 
    "37": "The Oslo Hypertension Study started in 1972 and lasted for 66 (range 60-78) months. A total of 785 healthy men, aged 40 to 49 years, with mild hypertension were randomised to a drug-treated group and to an untreated, control group. The drugs used for treatment were hydrochlorothiazide alone in 36%, hydrochlorothiazide and propranolol in 26%, hydrochlorothiazide and methyldopa in 20%, and other drugs in 18%. A total of 95% in the drug-treated group received hydrochlorothiazide. Pressure complications, such as stroke and aneurysms, only occurred in the control group. Coronary events were more numerous in the drug-treated group, so that the total incidence of cardiovascular complications did not significantly differ between the treated and untreated groups. After 5 and 10 years, total mortality was found to be the same in both groups. However, the 10-year coronary heart disease mortality was significantly higher in the drug-treated group than in the untreated controls (14 v 3, p less than 0.01). Possible reasons for the failing effect of drug treatment of hypertension on coronary heart disease is discussed, and attention is drawn to the adverse effect of diuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers, both on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. This is in contrast to the alpha-adrenergic blocker, prazosin, which has been shown to improve the blood lipid profile.", 
    "38": "Drug release from contact lenses was studied by a technological approach. Different parameters such as introduction of drug into the lenses, release, hydration level, molecular weight of drugs, kinetics of release, and clinical tests were reviewed. Therapeutical benefits of this kind of dispensation was taken up. The actual inadequacies from the techniques used must be palliated by publication of new performance technologies that are studied today.", 
    "39": "The Lipid Research Clinic trials established conclusively that lowering serum cholesterol reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease. Yet a number of clinical trials have demonstrated that many pharmacological agents commonly used to lower blood pressure also adversely affect serum lipid levels. Recent studies of prolonged use of beta-blockers and diuretics have failed to show that these agents have any clear primary preventive effect on coronary heart disease; in a few cases, these agents were believed to pose a greater risk of coronary heart disease than no antihypertensive treatment at all. These observations suggest that a reappraisal of current therapeutic schemes is in order. Because coronary heart disease is known to have many causes, primary preventive therapy must logically go beyond the relatively simple goal of lowering blood pressure. The metabolic effects of antihypertensive drugs, particularly on blood lipids, should also be taken into account. These effects could be of special clinical significance in relatively young patients, for whom the long-term risk of developing coronary heart disease is of major concern. This review discusses recent clinical trials examining the effects on lipids of diuretics, beta-blockers, and selective alpha-adrenoceptor blocking agents.", 
    "40": "The effects on corneal tissue of three marketed beta-blocker eye drops, carteolol 1% and 2%, befunolol 0.5% and 1%, and timolol 0.25% and 0.5%, were studied by instilling these drops into the eyes of rabbits twice daily for two consecutive months. The corneal sections were examined under a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope. Carteolol eye drops caused no pathological change in the corneal epithelium, whereas befunolol and timolol eye drops caused pronounced desquamation of the corneal epithelium and pronounced disappearance of microvilli. None of the three beta-blocker eye drops caused pathological changes in the parenchyma or endothelium of the cornea.", 
    "41": "Despite differences in vasodilatation, inotropy and chronotropy between verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem when tested in vitro, these drugs will produce similar central hemodynamic effects in healthy young or middle-aged individuals, provided they are given in equipotent doses. The individual profiles of hemodynamic action of these calcium channel blockers are briefly reviewed and discussed.", 
    "42": "Calcium antagonists are a chemically heterogenous group of agents with potent cardiovascular effects which are beneficial in the treatment of angina pectoris, arterial hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. The main side effects for the group are dose-dependent and the result of the main action or actions of the calcium antagonists, i.e. vasodilatation, negative inotropic effects and antiarrhythmic effects. Pronounced hypotension is reported for the main calcium antagonist drugs; verapamil, diltiazem and nifedipine. While conduction disturbances and bradycardia are seen more often after verapamil and diltiazem, tachycardia, headache and flush are more frequent after nifedipine. Constipation is relatively frequent after verapamil while nifedipine is reported to induce diarrhea in som patients. Idiosyncratic side effects are rare but have been reported from the skin, mouth, musculoskeletal system, the liver and the central nervous system. These side effects include urticarial rashes, gingival hyperplasia, arthralgia, hepathotoxicity and transistory mental confusion or akathisia. Verapamil, diltiazem and possibly also nifedipine have been reported to increase serum digoxin concentrations but the clinical relevance of these drug interactions are not clear. Furthermore, verapamil and diltiazem may potentiate the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs and verapamil may also potentiate the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs. It is concluded that side effects after calcium antagonist drugs are mostly trivial and transient although they may sometimes be relatively common. Clinically relevant drug interactions are few. Judged from the point of efficacy and safety, calcium antagonists will have a major place in the future pharmacotherapy of several cardiovascular disorders.",

    "45": "A total of 127 patients with arterial hypertension--64 with symptomatic and 63 with essential, were treated with chlophazolin \"Pharmachim\" at the Clinic of Therapy of Internal Diseases and Clinical Pharmacology for a period of one year. The drug was used alone in part of the patients and in the rest--in combination with other drugs. Satisfactory effect on the clinical symptoms and the level of blood pressure was attained in all patients treated and in only a small part of them diuretics and beta-blockers were necessary so as to attain better effect in coping with the arterial hypertension. In all patients the drug gave no toxic and allergic reactions, the most frequent adverse affects being the dryness of the mouth and sleepiness.", 
    "46": "The antihypertensive effect and tolerance of chlorpropanol was determined in 30 patients with hypertonic disease. The treatment was carried out only with tobanum as an open experiment with a dose from 10 to 30 mg. Before and towards the end of the treatment, the following indices were calculated from the simultaneous record of M-echocardiogram of left ventricle, ACG, PhCG and ECG: stroke volume (SV), minute volume (MV) cardiac index (CI), ejection fraction (EF), mean velocity of circumferential fibres shortening (Vcf), and peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Chlorpropanol normalized the pressure in 83.3% of the treated, reducing the systolic pressure with 14.9%, and the diastolic--with 15.1%. The reduction of the pressure in hyperkinetic type of circulation is associated with the reduction of CI (p less than 0.05) as result from the slowed down cardiac rate (p less than 0.001), in hypokinetic type--with the reduction of PVR (p less than 0.05), and in eukinetic--with the normalization of the ratio between those two parameters. EF was not changed during the treatment, Vcf was reduced (p less than 0.045), but remained within the physiological limits. Chlorpropanol is with pronounced negative chronotropic effect. It has a good tolerance.", 
    "47": "Although it is well established that autonomic control of ocular accommodation is predominantly parasympathetic, many investigators have, over the last 150 years, proposed that a supplementary sympathetic innervation should be considered. Particular attention is directed in this review to previous literature providing anatomical, physiological and pharmacological evidence for dual innervation of the ciliary muscle. Clinical and psychological evidence is shown to be equivocal. A review of recent laser optometry studies of tonic (\"dark-focus\") resting positions of accommodation indicates that the inhibitory nature of sympathetic innervation suggested by the majority of previous studies can be further defined with respect to specific adrenergic receptors. The implications of dual innervation relating to ocular accommodation during sustained near-vision tasks is discussed.", 
    "48": "Beta adrenergic control of extrarenal potassium disposal was evaluated by examining the effects of physiologic doses of beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists on potassium tolerance in acutely nephrectomized rats. Following an acute intravenous potassium load (0.17 mEq/100 g over 60 min), the plasma potassium concentration rose significantly less in animals concomitantly treated with epinephrine at a dose that raises plasma epinephrine concentration to levels found during surgical stress (maximum plasma K 2.2 vs. 2.9 mEq/1 in controls receiving KCl alone; p less than 0.005). Similar results were observed with the selective beta-2 agonists salbutamol and terbutaline. Conversely, the rise in plasma potassium concentration was significantly greater in rats treated with low-dose propranolol (beta-1 + beta-2 blockade) and with butoxamine (beta-2 blockade) compared to control animals. In contrast, the selective beta-1 blocking agent metoprolol had no effect on potassium tolerance. Alterations in potassium tolerance following the administration of various beta adrenergic agonists and antagonists could not be explained by changes in plasma insulin, renin, or glucose concentration or by differences in the acid-base or hemodynamic status of the animals. The data suggest that beta adrenergic control of extrarenal potassium disposal occurs with physiologic stimulation or blockade of the beta-2 receptor site.", 
    "49": "The effect of an i.v. administration of some beta-adrenergic blocking drugs on blood pressure has been investigated in rats after blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. Practolol and atenolol which do not penetrate the BBB, induced an immediate hypotensive effect after BBB breakdown by intracarotid (i.c.) injection of cetrimonium. In 39 week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats, practolol (15 mg/kg i.v.) and atenolol (3 mg/kg i.v.) induced a large drop in blood pressure while only a slight decrease was shown in normotensive ones. Likewise, acebutolol induced a significantly greater hypotension after BBB damage. On the other hand, the effects of dl-propranolol (5 mg/kg), quinidine (2.5 mg/kg) and isoproterenol (3 micrograms/kg) on blood pressure were not modified by pretreatment with cetrimonium i.c., while the hypotension induced by d-propranolol (5 mg/kg) was shortened. These results indicate that beta-adrenergic blocking agents with a low degree of lipophily can induce a hypotensive effect when their penetration into brain is largely enhanced after BBB opening either by prolonged hypertension or by cetrimonium. This effect is only dependent on their action on beta-adrenoreceptors; membrane stabilizing effect and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity do not seem to be involved.", 
    "50": "Propranolol, timolol and sotalol were compared with respect to their cardiotoxic properties in isolated, spontaneously beating rat hearts. Propranolol and timolol induced a dose-dependent decrease in myocardial contractility. A high dose of sotalol had only modest negative inotropic effects. Similar reductions in myocardial contractility were observed in isolated, ventricle-stimulated rat hearts. These observations were similar to those in a previous study in which spontaneously beating and ventricle-stimulated reserpinized rat hearts were investigated. Spontaneously beating rat hearts were perfused with a high-, a normal- and a low-Ca++ medium, each with and without propranolol, timolol and sotalol. Addition of each beta-blocker to a normal-Ca++ medium induced a decrease of myocardial contractility and of heart rate and an increase of AV-conduction time when compared with the drug-free medium. In a high-Ca++ medium containing the same concentration of each beta-blocker, a less pronounced decrease of myocardial contractility was observed. Heart rate decreased and AV-conduction time increased to the same extent as after perfusion with the drug containing normal-Ca++ medium. With respect to the corresponding drug-free medium perfusion with a low-Ca++ medium with each beta-blocker enhanced the decline in myocardial contractility, most pronounced in propranolol and timolol containing media. For propranolol and sotalol the decrease in heart rate and increase in AV-conduction time were similar to the results after administration of the same beta-blocker in a high- and a normal-Ca++ perfusion media. Timolol caused an electromechanical dissociation. It was concluded that in beta-blocker intoxication the negative-inotropic phenomena cannot be explained by an action of the drugs on the beta-receptor since the results in reserpinized and non-reserpinized rat hearts were similar. Other effects have to be responsible for the observed cardiotoxic phenomena. The present results indicate that these phenomena can be influenced by Ca++ and or can be attributed to differences in lipophilicity.", 
    "51": "Seven asthmatic patients were given a single placebo tablet in a first test session and then in two subsequent double blind sessions they randomly received 400 mg bevantolol or 100 mg atenolol, with at least 2 days between each of the sessions. Neither beta-blocker had any significant effect on FVC as compared to the placebo. FEV 1, however, was significantly lower 2 and 3 h after atenolol or bevantolol; there was no significant difference between the effects of the two drugs on FEV 1. Peak expiratory flow rate was reduced by bevantolol but not by atenolol, the difference reaching significance after 3 h. Fenoterol inhalation at the end of each test session always enhanced pulmonary performance, but to a lesser extent after bevantolol than after placebo or atenolol. A slower heart rate was recorded 2, 3, and 4 h after bevantolol and 3 and 4 h after atenolol; the mean 2-h value was significantly lower with atenolol than with bevantolol. No patient suffered any adverse effect. Bevantolol may be slightly less selective than atenolol.", 
    "52": "The beta-adrenergic selectivity of diacetolol, the major metabolite of acebutolol, has been compared with that of acebutolol, metoprolol and propranolol in 11 normal subjects. Bronchial and cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade were assessed on separate occasions after diacetolol 600 mg, acebutolol 400 mg, metoprolol 200 mg, propranolol 80 mg and placebo. Bronchial beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed as the displacement of the bronchodilator dose response curve to inhaled isoprenaline after each beta blocking drug compared to placebo and expressed as the dose ratio. Bronchodilatation was measured as change in specific airway conductance (sGaw) in the body plethysmograph. Cardiac beta-adrenoceptor blockade was assessed as the percentage reduction in exercise heart rate during the 5th minute of exercise at 70% of the subject's maximum work rate. There was a significant reduction in exercise heart rate with all 4 beta-blocking drugs when compared with placebo, 22% for diacetolol, 24% for acebutolol, 25% for propranolol and 28% for metoprolol. The reduction with metoprolol was significantly greater than the reduction with the other three beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Mean dose ratios for the airway isoprenaline dose response curves after each of the 4 beta-blocking drugs were 2.4 for diacetolol, 2.7 for metoprolol, 8 for acebutolol and 72 for propranolol. The difference between diacetolol and metoprolol was not significant. Thus diacetolol appears to be more cardioselective than acebutolol and both are more cardioselective than propranolol in man. Metoprolol is probably more cardioselective than diacetolol though interpretation of the differences in exercise heart rate is complicated by the fact that diacetolol has some intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "53": "Theoretically the increased sympathoadrenal activity following acute myocardial infarction might augment the haemodynamic impact of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. To evaluate this question 32 haemodynamic studies were performed to compare the effects of equivalent beta-blocking doses of propranolol (8 mg i.v.) and pindolol (0.8 mg i.v.) in patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction (A.M.I.) or stable coronary artery disease (and a presumptive low sympathetic state). In stable coronary artery disease there were clear differences between the haemodynamic impact of propranolol and pindolol. Propranolol decreased both heart rate (delta HR -7 beat/min) and cardiac index (delta CI -0.4 l/min/m2), with an increased pulmonary artery occluded pressure (delta PAOP +4 mmHg) and systemic vascular resistance index (delta SVRI +358 dyn X s X cm-5 m2). However an equivalent beta-blocking dose of pindolol increased PAOP (delta PAOP +3 mmHg) leaving other variables unchanged. These differential actions of propranolol and pindolol have previously been ascribed to the intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (I.S.A.) of pindolol maintaining cardiac pumping function in a low sympathetic state. In contrast following myocardial infarction, both drugs reduced cardiac index to a significantly greater extent compared with stable coronary artery disease (delta CI propranolol -0.81/min/m2; pindolol -0.4 l/min/m2; p less than 0.05); propranolol also reduced the systemic arterial blood pressure (delta systolic -10 mmHg; delta mean -5 mmHg; p less than 0.05). The haemodynamic relevance of the I.S.A. of pindolol appeared attenuated following A.M.I. These data are compatible with experimental evidence of sympathetic nervous activation following coronary occlusion; the resulting hyperadrenergic state appears to condition an augmented haemodynamic response to beta-blocking drugs irrespective of their ancillary pharmacological properties.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Propranolol and atropine inhibit cleavage divisions of X. laevis only after their intracellular administration. The level of the membrane potential (including a zero level) of the embryos studied is not essential for the cleavage divisions. Possible mechanisms of action of the \"prenervous\" neurotransmitters at the intracellular level and their coupling with second messengers are discussed.", 
    "55": "Intravenous amitraz caused significant hypotension and bradycardia in pentobarbitone anaesthetized guinea-pigs. Depression of blood pressure reached a plateau with a dose of 10 mg/kg but heart rate continued to fall in a dose-dependent manner, up to a fall of 90 beats per minute after a total of 160 mg/kg/min. Amitraz was then tested on spontaneously beating guinea-pig isolated atria. The maximum bath concentration approximated a blood concentration produced by 5 mg/kg amitraz in the guinea-pig (2.3 X 10(-4) M). Amitraz did not significantly shift the dose-response curve to isoprenaline or acetylcholine but antagonized histamine rate responses competitively in the presence of propranolol (2 X 10(-6) M). Propranolol unmasked a dose-dependent depressant effect of amitraz on atrial rate, an effect abolished with atropine (1 X 10(-5) M). Amitraz increased atrial force of contraction, an effect which was not seen when propranolol was present in the bath solution. Amitraz also depressed atrial rate directly, but this effect was minor in comparison to bradycardia seen in the guinea-pig. It is likely that the cardiovascular depression seen in the guinea-pig following amitraz i.v. is caused by an alteration in autonomic drive rather than a significant direct cardiac effect.", 
    "56": "A number of compounds showing general anesthetic action in the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus were investigated in the presence of acetylcholine. Non-ionizing anesthetics, including tricaine, showed no interaction with acetylcholine. However, highly ionized compounds like the local anesthetics procaine and lidocaine, the muscarinic blocker and local anesthetic atropine, and the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol showed a synergistic effect with acetylcholine. ACh increased the general anesthetic effect of these compounds in a statistically highly significant dose-dependent fashion. To account for the mechanism of this unusual and novel effect it is proposed that these compounds interact with the anesthetic binding site of the rotifer cholinoceptor ionophore in the open state. It is also proposed that non-ionizing compounds have a general membrane effect only. In addition to anesthesia, atropine and propranolol cause foot paralysis in B. calyciflorus. This other novel effect is also enhanced by acetylcholine as well as decamethonium, a neuromuscular blocker.", 
    "57": "Whether beta-2 adrenergic receptors are only for the circulating catecholamines in isolated ventricular muscles of carp heart was studied. Isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine had concentration dependent positive inotropic effects. The ED50 values for isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were 6.23 +/- 1.9, 87.3 +/- 27.3 and 4500 +/- 580 nM, respectively. Phentolamine did not alter the inotropic effects. Tyramine increases the force of contraction and this action was completely blocked by propranolol and reserpine, but not by atenolol. Norepinephrine levels, in comparison with those of epinephrine, were similar in plasma and higher in ventricular muscles. However, the norepinephrine levels in ventricular muscles of carp heart were markedly lower than those in ventricular muscles of rat heart. These results suggest that ventricular muscles of carp heart contain adrenergic neurons, and that a catecholamine released from the nerve terminals, presumably epinephrine, may stimulate beta-2 adrenergic receptors.", 
    "58": "The positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol was quantified in the presence of several beta-adrenergic blocking agents in ventricular strips of carp heart. Isoproterenol had a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect. The effect was markedly inhibited by propranolol and carteolol, but was extremely insensitive to atenolol. Practolol totally failed to alter the effect. These results indicated that the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol may be mediated by mostly beta-2 adrenergic receptors in ventricular strips of carp heart.", 
    "59": "In the last year, two large randomized controlled trials of metoprolol (MIAMI, almost 6,000 patients) and atenolol (ISIS 1, over 16,000 patients) given intravenously within 12 hours of the onset of acute myocardial infarction reduced mortality by about 15% in low-risk subjects. The reduction was significant for atenolol (2P = 0.04) but not for metoprolol, probably because of the smaller size of that trial. The reduction in mortality in both trials was nearly all in the first 36 hours, a finding that reduced the fears that the treatment might produce irreversible failure, shock, or heart block. Tolerance in these relatively low-risk subjects (control mortality about 5%) was good. Inotropes were used in 1-2% more subjects in the beta-blocked group but were effective in reversing the side effects without increasing mortality. No clear subgroups (age, sex, site, time from onset, initial blood pressure or heart rate) were found in which treatment was more beneficial. In the ISIS study, patients with higher heart rates were more likely to need inotropes after beta blockade and patients with long PR intervals at entry were more likely to develop block. Neither of these complications resulted in excess mortality in the blocked group, which suggests that these adverse effects were largely reversible.",

The mechanisms and biological importance of these disturbances are not clearly defined. Nonetheless, it is possible that autonomic disturbances play an important role in the pathophysiology and prognosis of heart failure, and therefore drugs that alter autonomic function may provide additional therapeutic options in the management of this syndrome.", 
    "61": "All patients in alcohol withdrawal should have a full assessment for detecting medical complications. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-A) scale permits a quantitative assessment for following the clinical course and therapeutic response in patients in withdrawal. Most patients with mild withdrawal symptoms do not require hospitalization and respond to non-pharmacologic supportive care. Early initiation of treatment with supportive nursing care and, if necessary, benzodiazepines usually will prevent progression to serious withdrawal reactions and provide the patient with sufficient symptomatic relief. Pharmacotherapy can be considerably simplified by using the loading dose technique, i.e., giving diazepam every 1-2 hr initially until the patient shows signs of clinical improvement and/or mild sedation. If long half-life drugs (e.g., diazepam) are used, further therapy is rarely needed and complications are prevented. Short-acting benzodiazepines can also be given in a similar fashion in the milder clinical syndrome. Phenytoin should only be given to patients with a preexisting seizure disorder. Phenothiazines, barbiturates, paraldehyde, and antihistamines have no role in the treatment of withdrawal because of their toxicity or lack of efficacy. Haloperidol is effective in the control of hallucinations in patients also treated with a benzodiazepine. The treatment of alcoholic intoxication and withdrawal is only the first step toward full rehabilitation.", 
    "62": "Rats that are placed in a novel environment containing a probe will explore the environment and the probe. Exploration of the probe is reduced when the probe is electrified. We here report that chlordiazepoxide blocks this inhibition, and have determined some of the pharmacological features of this new experimental procedure. The procedure appears to be sensitive to the effects of several benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and related compounds. Limited activity was observed with most 5-HT antagonists, ritanserin, an anticholinergic, a beta-adrenergic blocker and a neuroleptic. Of the antidepressants, only imipramine had some limited activity. Inactive compounds in this procedure include benzodiazepine antagonists, buspirone, convulsants, opiates, an opiate antagonist, stimulants, a putative DA agonist and antagonist, histamine antagonists, a cholinomimetic, anticholinergics, a NE antagonist, alpha 2 agonists, an alpha 2 antagonist, MAO inhibitors, 5-HTP and LSD.", 
    "63": "The comparison of different beta-blocking agents and their influences on the breakup time (BUT) reveals that levobunolol reduces the BUT in the same way as physiologic saline solutions, while other beta-blockers lead to an enormous reduction of BUT.", 
    "64": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are observed under 3 anatomic forms: septal, concentric, apical. Their pathogenesis is still unknown. Theorie involving catecholamine appears the most acceptable. Among the diagnostic signs, septum cellular disorganization is the precise anatomic criteria. Obstructive cardiomyopathy is no longer an isolated entity, but a form of transition between the three anatomic forms. Pronostic is dominated by sudden death; amiodarone is the best preventive treatment.", 
    "65": "Agonist treatment of C6-glioma cells induces two altered states in beta-adrenergic receptors, a low affinity for the hydrophilic antagonist CGP-12177 and a low affinity for agonists like isoproterenol. We present evidence that, in cells not treated to inhibit receptor internalization, the two properties occur with a different time course, the low affinity for isoproterenol preceding that for CGP-12177. In that the low affinity for CGP-12177 is due to the internalization of the receptor, the results indicate that uncoupling of the receptor, indicated by the low affinity for isoproterenol, occurs while the receptor is still located on the cell surface. Removal of the agonist leads to reappearance of the receptor to the plasma membrane followed by loss of the uncoupled state."
