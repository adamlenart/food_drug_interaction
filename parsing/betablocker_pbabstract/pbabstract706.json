    "0": "A double-blind study was made of men who had had a myocardial infarction at least one year previously, and who were being treated with propranolol, atenolol, or placebo. They were compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects. Under resting conditions, there were no differences between the systemic arterial blood pressures, forearm blood flows, or heart rates of the control subjects and the post-infarction patients treated with placebo. The patients, however, showed signs of reduced sympathetic effects on the cardiovascular system when their reflex responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre, lower body negative pressure, and performance of a mental task were assessed. Long-term treatment with propranolol or artenolol had little effect on resting systemic arterial blood pressure or forearm blood flow, but caused a significant reduction in resting heart rate. Differences in the reflex responses of these patients and those on placebo were attributable to the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on resting heart rate. These results indicate that post-infarction patients do not have signs of overactivity of autonomic nervous control of the cardiovascular system. Furthermore, long-term treatment of such patients with beta-adrenoceptor antagonists does not impair cardiovascular reflexes.", 
    "1": "The article discusses the data on the reactivity of the cardiovascular system of Okamoto--Aoki rats with spontaneous hypertension depending on the stage of the disease and of control animals of the same age but with normal arterial pressure to functional noradrenaline load prior to and in the presence of inderal block of beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "2": "The effect on performance of a standard dose of a beta-blocking drug was examined in a controlled test situation closely approximating actual flying training conditions and involving helicopter flying skills. Pindolol or a placebo was administered 90 min before a test flight and the flying and hovering performance of five students was assessed by qualified flying instructors. No significant difference was found between assigned performance ratings of test drug flights and placebo flights. It could not be concluded that a beta-blocking drug would improve the hovering performance of ab initio helicopter trainee pilots.", 
    "3": "The teaching that thyroid replacement therapy can aggravate angina or induce myocardial infarction in patients with hypothyroidism and coronary disease, and thus compel acceptance of incomplete control of either, was substantiated in 51 patients (18 with iatrogenic and 30 with idiopathic primary hypothyroidism, and three with secondary hypothyroidism as a component of panhypopituitarism). Based upon clinical and laboratory criteria, control of hypothyroidism was unsatisfactory in two fifths of the patients. Judged by frequency and ease of induction of angina and nitroglycerine requirement, control of angina was unsatisfactory in one-third. In many patients maximal tolerated dose of thyroid varied with time. The effect of combined propranolol and thyroid therapy in 13 patients was quite satisfactory in seven patients, fair in three and poor in three, but excellent in none. Transfusions were useful as a short- or long-term expedient in a few. Of 12 patients considered for coronary revascularization, three were rejected because of other medical problems and one showed prompt improvement after the dose of thyroid was decreased. Five of the remaining eight studied by coronary cineangiography were rejected as unsuitable for surgery. The remaining three were subjected to coronary revascularization. One did well for a time, apparently until a graft became occluded, the remaining two are still doing well. Coronary bypass graft surgery may deserve a larger role in the future management of these patients.", 
    "4": "The effect of the administration of a single oral dose of placebo, oxprenolol and metoprolol on insulin-induced hypoglycemia was investigated in seven insulin-dependent diabetics in a double-blind randomized study. Neither of the beta-blocking agents accelerated the plasma glucose lowering effect of insulin. Plasma glucose recovery from hypoglycemia was grossly impaired in diabetics whether blocked or not, and all investigations had to be terminated by i.v. glucose injection after 1 hr of sustained hypoglycemia. During the period of observation, no further delaying effect by either beta-blocker was observed. The lack of plasma glucose recovery seems to be at least in part related to a retarded and reduced glucagon response to hypoglycemia. Both drugs blocked the hypoglycemia-induced pulse rate increase, but neither caused bradycardia. A significant increase in diastolic pressure was recorded with oxprenolol, whereas a drop in systolic pressure was noted with metoprolol. Oxprenolol suppressed the NEFA rise after insulin-infusion termination to a greater extent than did metoprolol. Hypoglycemic symptoms were not affected by beta-blockade. The results suggest that neither drug further worsens the already grossly impaired plasma glucose recovery, but that oxprenolol and metoprolol may differ in their effects on hemodynamic response to hypoglycemia. This aspect of the problem requires further study under careful control in hypertensive diabetics.", 
    "5": "In a double-blind randomized study, the effect of the acute administration of a single oral dose of oxprenolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, and of metoprolol, a beta 1 selective blocker, on insulin-induced hypoglycemia was tested in seven normal subjects. Neither of the drugs potentiated the hypoglycemic effect of insulin. The recovery from hypoglycemia was delayed by both blocking agents only in the late phases of the experimental observation. This effect could not be accounted for by suppression of release of the counterregulatory hormones glucagon or cortisol, but may be mediated by the inhibition of NEFA and gluconeogenic-substrate release in response to hypoglycemia. Both drugs blocked the hypoglycemia-induced tachycardia. Only oxprenolol raised diastolic blood pressure during hypoglycemia. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were not masked by either blocking agent, and sweating was enhanced and prolonged by both drugs. Thus, no clear-cut differences in the glycemic response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were found between metoprolol and oxprenolol, but the drugs differed in their influence upon the blood pressure response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.", 
    "6": "Iodinated and radioiodinated analogs of propranolol and N,N-dimethylpropranolol were synthesized wherein an iodophenyl moiety replaced the naphthalene ring of the parent drug. These new compounds were evaluated not only for their beta-adrenergic blocking and antiarrhythmic activities but also for their ability to accumulate selectively in myocardial tissue. Like propranol, the iodinated analogs displayed comparable beta-blocking and antiarrhythmic activity, and the order of potency was ortho- > meta- > para-iodophenyl. Quaternization of propranolol and the iodinated analogs eliminated the beta-adrenergic blocking activity but retained the antiarrhythmic property of the secondary amine precursors. Among the quaternary salts, the antiarrhythmic potency was meta- > ortho- > para-iodophenyl. Tissue distribution of the radioiodinated derivatives revealed that only the quaternary derivatives were selectively accumulated in myocardial tissue. These results demonstrate that an iodophenyl ring can substitute for th naphthalene ring in propranolol and its quaternary salt without significant alteration of pharmacological properties. The radioiodinated quaternary derivatives may be useful pharmacological tools in experiments aimed at relating antiarrhythmic activity to myocardial uptake.", 
    "7": "The properties of adenylate cyclase from bovine and human corneal epithelium were investigated. Adrenergic drugs were the most effective stimulatory agents tested in bovine tissue, causing greater activation than did fluoride. Isoproterenol was the most potent agonist, followed by epinephrine and norepinephrine. Phenylephrine and dopamine also stimulated adenylate cyclase through beta-adrenergic receptors at relatively high concentrations. Enzyme stimulation by all the adrenergic drugs tested was completely inhibited by 1 microM propranolol or 0.1 microM timolol. The GTP analogue, GppNp, produced considerable activation and caused an augmented response when combined with isoproterenol, but not with fluoride. Prostaglandins E1, E2, or F2 alpha produced a small but significant stimulation over control which was not sensitive to propranolol inhibition. Adenylate cyclase from human corneal epithelium exhibited qualitatively similar characteristics to those of the bovine enzyme. Fluoride was the most effective stimulatory agent, followed by isoproterenol, phenylephrine, and dopamine. Prostaglandins failed to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in human corneal epithelial preparations.", 
    "8": "Adjustment of dosage of a renally excreted drug (or active metabolite) for patients with severe renal failure still causes some difficulties. It is therefore helpful to select, within a given therapeutic group of drugs, a compound that is particularly safe and easy to use and, if possible, does not require adjustment of dosage. This is 'the drug of choice for renal patients'. Such a drug would ideally meet the following pharmacokinetic criteria: normal urinary excretion less than 30% of the administered dose, predominant biliary and intestinal removal, disposition essentially unaffected by parameters likely to be modified in renal failure (e.g. changes in serum proteins or fluid compartments: receptor sensitivity, etc), and pharmacokinetics not complicated by the formation of active or toxic metabolites that depend on urinary elimination. Above all, the drug should have a wide therapeutic margin and must be free of nephrotoxicity. Examples of drugs of choice for patients with impaired renal function are given for some important therapeutic groups and special emphasis is placed on antibiotics and beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents.", 
    "9": "The cardiac beta-adrenergic response to noradrenaline (NA) was investigated in the rat neonatally s.c. treated with 6-hydroxydopa (6-OHDOPA, 75 mg/kg, 0, 2 and 4 days after birth). 6-OHDOPA treatment significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the NA content by 32% of the control in whole heart and markedly potentiated the isoproterenol (0.17 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced stimulation of ornithine decarboxylase activity which had been blocked by a preceding i.p. injection of propranol (10 mg/kg) at the adult stage. Scatchard analysis of the specific [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA0 binding indicated that 6-OHDOPA induced an increase in the maximum number of specific binding sites of [3H]DHA but did not alter the dissociation constant. In addition, 6-OHDOPA treatment resulted in a potentiation of the positive inotropic response to NA but not to isoproterenol in isolated atria. It is suggested that 6-OHDOPA treatment produces an increased density of beta-adrenergic receptor sites relevant to the hypersensitivity of beta-receptors to NA.", 
    "10": "The disposition and activity of some beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in the rats was determined using an ex vivo receptor binding assay. Rats were injected with different doses of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists and the extent of receptor occupation was assessed in various tissues under in vitro conditions. Rats treated with (-)-propranolol (0.1 mumol. kg-1) displayed peak plasma levels of biologically active drug assayed by radioreceptor assay 15 min after administration. On the other hand, the highest concentration of bioactive drug, assessed by ex vivo assays, was observed at 30 min in all tissues examined. Dose-response curves revealed that (-)-propranolol was about 100 fold more potent than (+)-propranolol in all tissues examined, and that there was a small (3 fold) degree of selectivity for both isomers towards lung and spleen over heart, cortex and cerebellum. The affinity of (-)-propranolol in heart and lung using the ex vivo binding assay was similar to the affinity of this agent to inhibit in vivo isoprenaline-stimulated cyclic AMP formation in these tissues. The beta 1-selective antagonist (+/-)-atenolol demonstrated selectivity towards those tissues that have been previously shown to possess a predominance of beta 1-adrenoceptors, though penetration to the central nervous system was substantially less than propranolol. The inherent advantages of this ex vivo assay are discussed.", 
    "11": "Thirty outpatients with arterial hypertension were treated for eight weeks with a daily dose of one tablet of Cardiotensin, taken after breakfast. The compound contains 100mg bupranolol, 10mg bemetizide and 20mg triamterene. Drug therapy was preceded by a one-week placebo washout period. Within two weeks of treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure had reverted to normal in 26 of the patients. At the end of the observation period, 4 patients still had diastolic pressure values of more than 100 mm Hg. Ergometer stress testing revealed clear-cut diminution of blood pressure and heart rate elevations following the medication. Serum potassium levels were not influenced by the drug. Under the mentioned dose regimen there were no changes in serum uric acid, creatinine, and glucose concentrations. Tolerability was generally good.", 
    "12": "Atropine sulfate 0.04 mg/Kg i.v. and propranolol 0.2 mg/Kg i.v. were administered to patients with SSS in an attempt to determine intrinsic heart rate (IHR). Sinus node recovery time (SNRT) was determined before and after autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade. This method could distinguish SSS patients in two groups: group I was composed of patients with extrinsic sinus node dysfunction, group II was composed of patients with intrinsic sinus node dysfunction. We conclude that this differentiation is of great importance for clinical-prognostic evaluation and therapeutic program in SSS.", 
    "13": "A study has been made of the effects of drugs known to elevate c-AMP level on radiation-induced damage in thymocytes. The test used was the ability of the cells to exclude dye, beta-receptor stimulation and phosphodiesterase inhibition were found to induce radioresistance. The possible importance of the plasma membrane in connection with cytoplasmic factors is briefly discussed.", 
    "14": "Neurotensin (NT), an endogenous tridecapeptide, produces significant hypothermia after intracisternal (i.c.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration in microgram quantities in a variety of laboratory animals. The present study sought to clarify the mechanism of the hypothermic action by utilizing pharmacological treatments which alter the function of brain neurotransmitter systems. Pretreatment of rats with anti-muscarinic (atropine), anti-noradrenergic (propranolol, a beta-blocker; phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-blocker) or anti-opiate (naloxone) agents did not significantly alter NT-induced hypothermia. Similarly depletion of brain serotonin (5-HT) with parachlorophenylalanine did not affect NT-induced hypothermia. However, depletion of brain catecholamine content with 6-hydroxydopamine resulted in a significant potentiation of NT-induced hypothermia as did pretreatment with haloperidol, a dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist. Furthermore, in rats with selective depletions of brain DA, but not norepinephrine (NE), NT-induced hypothermia was significantly augmented. Thus an interaction between brain DA systems and NT appears likely. These data indicate that NT-induced hypothermia is not dependent on intact functional activity of NE, 5-HT, muscarinic ACh or endogenous opiate systems but suggests interactions between brain DA circuits and NT. In other experiments, NT-induced hypothermia was found to be antagonized significantly by i.c. injection of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), but not by pretreatment with L-triiodothyronine. Another endogenous tripeptide (Pro--Leu--Gly--NH2, MIF-I) had no effect. Thyroidectomy (THX) significantly potentiated NT-induced hypothermia; NT administered i.c. significantly reduced the high serum TSH levels of THX rats. Thus, NT and TRH, two endogenous peptides, appear to be antagonists in certain systems.", 
    "15": "The unique properties of agonist binding to the frog erythrocyte beta-adrenergic receptor include the existence of two affinity forms of the receptor. The proportion and relative affinity of these two states of the receptor for ligands varies with the intrinsic activity of the agonist and the presence of guanine nucleotides. The simplest model for hormone-receptor interactions which can explain and reproduce the experimental data involves the interaction of the receptor R with an additional membrane component X, leading to the agonist-promoted formation of a high affinity ternary complex HRX. Computer modeling of agonist binding data with a ternary complex model indicates that the model can fit the data with high accuracy under conditions where the ligand used is either a full or a partial agonist and where the system is altered by the addition of guanine nucleotide or after treatment with group-specific reagents, e.g. p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The parameter estimates obtained indicate that the intrinsic activity of the agonist is correlated significantly with the affinity constant L of the component X for the binary complex HR. The major effect of adding guanine nucleotides is to destabilize the ternary complex HRX from which both the hormone H and the component X can dissociate. The modulatory role of nucleotides on the affinity of agonists for the receptor is consistent with the assumption that the component X is the guanine nucleotide binding site. The ternary complex model was also applied successfully to the turkey erythrocyte receptor system. The model provides a general scheme for the activation by agonists of adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor systems and also of other systems where the effector might be different.", 
    "16": "The effect of a single daily dose of timolol, hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride hydrochloride in fixed combination (Moducren; MDS) in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension was tested during 1978 in an open study covering 10 weeks per patient. This was subsequently extended to cover a total of 50 weeks per patient, and the results are compared. Of the patients studied during phase 1, 91,5% responded with a fall in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more. This figure decreased to 87,5% during phase 2, but none the less remained satisfactory. A single daily dose of one tablet or less of the trial preparation proved effective in the majority of patients (75%). Adverse effects were infrequent and usually of a minor nature.", 
    "17": "214 patients were studied in a randomised trial to determine whether administraiton of intravenous atenolol within 12 hours of chest pain reduced eventual infarct size, as estimated by cumulative enzyme release and by ECG changes. 135 patients already had ECG evidence of infarction at entry; 72 received atenolol which significantly decreased subsequent enzyme release (atenolol and control means = 121 IU, SE +/- 10 and 177 IU, SE +/- 17; 2p < 0.005) and enhanced R-wave preservation (atenolol and control means = 46% +/- 3 and 36% +/- 3; 2p < 0.02). 79 patients had no evidence of infarction at entry; 44 did not receive atenolol and 27 of these subsequently developed infarction, whereas only 11 of 35 treated patients infarcted during their hospital stay (2p < 0.01). In hospital, fewer atenolol patients died (4 vs 9), had non-fatal cardiac arrests (2 vs 6), or required therapy for heart-failure (36 vs 47). Unlike many previous trials which had negative results, in this trial we gave the drug intravenously and promptly (median of 4 hours from onset of pain to injecton), thereby achieving early beta-blockade.", 
    "18": "Fast, reliable, specific and sensitive methods are reported to accurately quantitate unchanged, propranolol in plasma, and its major metabolites in plasma and urine after enzymatic hydrolysis without the need for solvent extraction. These methods enable the analyst to process a large number of propranolol samples in one working day and should prove valuable to clinical laboratories demanding both speed and specificity in an assay.", 
    "19": "In the isolated rabbit papillary muscle, adenosine (1-300 microM) alone scarcely affected the basal tension developed. The positive inotropic action of isoprenaline, mediated via beta-adrenoceptors, was inhibited by adenosine in a concentration-dependent manner. Atropine (0.3 microM) abolish the inhibitory action of carbachol on the isoprenaline-induced positive inotropic action but not affect the inhibitory asction of adenosine. Adenosine failed to inhibit the positive inotropic action exerted by phenylephrine via stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the presence of pindolol (30 nM). The present results indicate that the positive inotropic action was mediated via alpha-adrenoceptors whose subecllular mechanism was not susceptible to the inhibitory action of adenosine as are beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "The injection of small doses of nylidrin into the vertebral artery lowered blood pressure in chloralose-anesthetized cats. Cerebroventricular perfusion of nylidrin also decreased blood pressure and inhibited or modified cardiovascular reflexes. There was inhibition of the reflex bradycardia evoked by i.v. noradrenaline or angiotensin. Likewise the pressure increase due to bilateral carotid occlusion was diminished. The blood pressure decrease elicited by stimulation of the central stump of a cut vagus nerve was inhibited or reversed. The pattern of central cardiovascular effects of nylidrin seemed not compatible with its well known beta-sympathomimetic properties. Indirect evidence points to an interasction with central alpha-receptors.", 
    "21": "Microsomal antibodies and antibodies directed toward the receptor for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) decreased in parallel while patients with Graves' disease were taking carbimazole, whereas no significant changes were observed during treatment with placebo or propranolol. The changes in autoantibody levels during carbimazole treatment were independent of changes in serum thyroxine and could have been due to a direct effect of the drug on autoantibody synthesis. Evidence for this suggestion was provided when low doses of methimazole (the active metabolite of carbimazole) were found to inhibit thyroid-autoantibody production in cultured lymphocytes. Since thyroid lymphocytes are probably a major site of thyroid-antibody synthesis in Graves' disease and methimazole is concentrated in the thyroid during treatment, a local action of the drug on antibody production seems likely. This possibility could be important in the use of carbimazole to control hyperthyroidism.", 
    "22": "A patient with propranolol-induced mental status changes was studied during and after the period of propranolol intoxication. While intoxicated he manifested the syndrome of \"non-aphasic misnaming,\" did poorly on the nonverbal portions of the WAIS, and exhibited perseveration and variability of performance. Our observations clarify the nature of the neurobehavioral disturbances in toxic-metabolic encephalopathies.", 
    "23": "The use of intravenous metoprolol in a dose of 0.06--0.17 mg/kg body weight proved effective in the treatment of sinus tachycardia in excess of 150 beats/min and/or ventricular dysrhythmias associated with light halothane anaesthesia for outpatient dental surgery. There were no side-effects related to this cardioselective beta-blocker in the dosage used. The prophylactic use of oral metoprolol should be considered for patients who find the prospect of dental treatment a fearsome experience.", 
    "24": "Full recovery occurred after 15 months of severe congestive heart failure in a patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy. Clinical improvement was noted when propranolol was added to conventional therapy.", 
    "25": "Isolated perfused rat mesentery has been used to define alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors. Norepinephrine was used as a reference substance to induce vasoconstrictor responses (increase in perfusion pressure). Log-dose response curves were obtained in the dose range between 0.3-10 mug. Labetalol, a known competitive inhibitor of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, when administered as a single bolus injection (3 mug) initially induced predominant alpha-blockade lasting upto 75 min followed by potentiation of the vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine used at multiple dose levels. This potentiation was maximum between 150-195 min after injection of labetalol. This potentiating effect of labetalol observed in the later phase of the experiment might be related to its inhibitory mechanism of neuronal uptake.", 
    "26": "The aim of the present investigation was to study the modifying effect of autonomic blockade with atropine plus propranolol and atropine alone on the electrophysiologic response to digitoxin during an observation period of 8 hours. Twenty-five pentobarbital-anaesthetised Labrador dogs were used. Pacing and programmed electrical stimulation were used to determine heart rate independent changes in repolarisation times and the effective (V-ERP) and the functional (V-FRP) refractory periods. The dogs were divided into three groups and all dogs got digitoxin (2.0 mg) intravenously during 5 min. Fourteen dogs were given digitoxin without blockade, while 5 dogs were pretreated with propranolol 0.5 mg/kg plus atropine 0.05 mg/kg every hour for 8 hours and 6 dogs with atropine in the same dose and with the same interval. Digitoxin alone increased 50 and 90% repolarisation times 2-4 hours after injection of the drug. During autonomic blockade digitoxin induced a shortening of action potential duration, and thus digitoxin interacts with autonomic transmitters resulting in prolongation of action potential duration. The \"direct\" effects of digitoxin, the action potential shortening effect, the decrease in membrane responsiveness (i.e. V-ERP/50% repolarisation time) reached a maximum 2-3 hours after injection of the drug.", 
    "27": "The influence of two beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, propranolol and pindolol, on the haemodynamic effects of papaverine, isoprenaline and noradrenaline was investigated in 9 male patients with first degree essential hypertension. Propranolol and pindolol were given according to a doubleblind, crossover scheme. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured before and after each treatment. Propranolol 670 microgram/kg i.v. reduced the supine and standing systolic blood pressures by 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Similarly, the intravenous administration of pindolol 35 microgram/kg reduced supine and standing systolic blood pressure by 5.5% and 8.3% respectively (clinically insignificant). Neither drug affected diastolic blood pressure. Following propranolol, there were moderate reduction in supine and standing heart rates, respectively by 24% and 20% (p < 0.001). Similarly, but to a lesser extent, pindolol reduced supine and standing heart rate by 12% and 17% (p < 0.001). The effects of papaverine, which, at 1.5 mg/kg i.v. reduced systolic blood pressure by 5-10% and increased heart rate by 8-15%, were not significantly influenced by the beta-blockers. The blood pressure and heart rate responses to isoprenaline, on the other hand, were attenuated or inhibited by both beta-blockers. While the beta-blockers inhibited the beta-adrenoceptor component of noradrenaline, the pressor component of noradrenaline, which is mediated through the alpha-adrenoceptors, was not influenced by propranolol, but was inhibited after pindolol. It is concluded that pindolol differs qualitatively from propranolol in that it inhibited both the alpha and beta-adrenoceptor effects of noradrenaline.", 
    "28": "The effect of exercise on renal haemodynamics was examined in young patients with mild essential hypertension. Four groups of subjects were studied: 13 normotensive, healthy control subjects, and 15 untreated, 11 propranolol-treated, and 6 labetalol-treated patients. Renal plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were measured during four consecutive periods, a pre-exercise control period, two exercise periods with loads of 450 kpm/min and 600 kpm/min, respectively, and a post-exercise control period. In the untreated patients RPF and GFR were lower during exercise than in the normotensive control subjects, whereas no significant differences were found at rest. In the propranolol-treated patients the reduction in RPF and GFR during exercise was more pronounced than in the untreated hypertensives. In the labetalol-treated patients however, RPF and GFR were reduced only to the same degree as in the untreated hypertensives. The reduced renal blood flow in propranolol-treated patients may be attributed to a compensatory increase in sympathetic activity caused by an impaired cardiac response to exercise. The lack of reduction in renal blood flow during labetalol therapy could partly be related to alpha-adrenergic blockade in the renal vascular bed induced by labetalol, and partly to the smaller reduction in cardiac output during labetalol than during propranolol therapy.", 
    "29": "Formation of encephalogenic shortened reflex in rabbits induced specific local changes of amplitudes of the 1-min waves. Etimizol rapidly stabilized the level of the 1-min waves and fixed the reflex, keeping the local character of the response. Propylnorantiphein enhanced corticofugal projections to the thalamus. The shifts in the brain energy exchange (the creatin--phosphate, glycogen contents) coincided in time with the amplitude shifts of the 1-min waves and occurred within 20--30 min after administration of neurotropic drugs lasting 2--3 hrs. The etimizol recruited both alpha-and beta-adrenoreceptors whereas the propylnorantiphein involved mainly the alpha-adrenoreceptors. Etimizol, being an unspecific connector, enhanced consolidation of the shortened reflex increasing the local response to electric stimulation, whereas propylnorantiphein aided to spreading of the responses over to the thalamic nuclei.", 
    "30": "The case of a 73-year-old woman with frequent disabling attacks of supraventricular tachycardia refractory to pharmacological therapy is presented. Successful management was achieved with a radio-frequency-activated pacemaker.", 
    "31": "Evidence suggests that the combined alpha and beta adrenergic agonist phenylephrine influences cardiac tissue through stimulation of both alpha and beta adrenoceptors. Phenylephrine effected a positive inotropic and chronotropic response in paced (1 Hz) left and spontaneously beating right atria, respectively. In the presence of the combined alpha and beta adrenoceptor antagonist labetalol (5 x 10(-6)M) the rate and force responses to phenylephrine were completely abolished. The data suggest that phenylephrine exerts its inotropic and chronotropic effects through both alpha and beta adrenoceptors in such a way that both adrenoceptors must be blocked in order to completely abolish the responses induced by the dual agonist.", 
    "32": "During a previous pregnancy supraventricular tachycardia complicated delivery in time in a woman with WPW-syndrome (Typ A) known since seven years. In the 34th week of the second pregnancy onset of preterm labor with a pelvic score of 7 and a tocolysis index of 5 was indication for tocolytic therapy. For protection against paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia tocolysis with the semiselective beta 2-stimulating compound Fenoterol was started in combination with the beta 1-selective blocking compound Metoprolol. Tocolysis lasted 6 days without cardiac complications. Also during labor no tachycardia set on. The duration of tocolysis with Fenoterol/Metoprolol in this case was comparable with the duration of tocolysis reported for monotherapy with Fenoterol in similar obstetric states. In patients with WPW-syndrome the combination of a semiselective beta 2-simulating compound with a beta 1-blocking agent seems to offer a new possibility for tocolytic therapy.", 
    "33": "Previous in situ studies have implicated differences in the pacemaker rates between the left and right ventricular conduction system. Our studies were conducted to characterize automaticity in peripheral right and left canine Purkinje fibers in vitro. Standard microelectrode techniques were utilized. In paired right (RPF) and left (LPF) canine Purkinje fibers, control intrinsic rate (IR) was found to be higher in LPF (24.8 +/- 1.7 beats/min) than in RPF (11.5 +/- 1.5 beats/min, P less than 0.01). Following overdrive stimulation at various cycle lengths, LPF consistently showed earlier escape beats. In low K0+ (1.35 mM), IR increased comparably in both RPF and LPF. However, high K0+ (5.4 mM) resulted in a greater reducton of the IR in RPF (-78%) than in LPF (-58%). After epinephrine (10(-6) M) the IR of LPF > RPF although the chronotropic response was more pronounced in RPF. Adrenergic stimulation preceded by beta-adrenergic blockade did not produce significant differences in the intrinsic rate between RPF and LPF. These findings indicate that automaticity in right and left Purkinje strands is functionally dissimilar.", 
    "34": "The beta-blocking potency of timolol was compared with that of propranolol under steady-state conditions in eight healthy subjects. The effects on systolic time intervals in healthy subjects and patients (n = 6) with coronary artery disease were evaluated in relation to varying timolol dose schedules and plasma concentrations. The beta-blocking potency was assessed by the inhibition of exercise-induced tachycardia. Timolol was eight times as potent as propranolol. There was wide between-patient variation (2.6 to 13.8) in timolol plasma concentration, and correlation between dose and peak (r = 0.61, p < 0.01) or nadir (r = 0.5 p < 0.01). There was a relatively weak correlation between timolol plasma concentration and degree of beta-blockade (r = 0.45, p < 0.05) and a linear correlation with dose (r = 0.98, p < 0.001). In healthy subjects timolol and propranolol had variable effects on systolic time intervals but in patients with coronary artery disease equipotent doses prolonged the preejection period, isovolumetric contraction time, and the ratio of the preejection period over the left ventricular ejection time. In patients as well as in normal subjects, the data indicated considerable beta-blocking effects for both drugs at the end of a 12-hourly dosing schedule, suggesting that twice-daily timolol and propranolol may be clinically practical.", 
    "35": "Ventricular tachycardia is unusual in infancy. Three infants are described in whom this arrhythmia was documented by electrophysiologic studies. The ability to start and terminate this rhythm by critically timed premature ventricular stimulation suggests a reentrant mechanism. All three patients have remained free of arrhythmias on oral propranolol therapy.", 
    "36": "Carotid baroreceptors of nine healthy young men and women were stretched or compressed with neck suction or pressure, before and after beta-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade, to evaluate several nonlinearities of sinus node baroreflex responses. Sinus node inhibition was related linearly to the intensity of brief baroreceptor stimuli over a range extending from carotid-distending pressures of about 101 +/- 5 (mean +/- SE) to 160 +/- 6 mm Hg (the subject's average systolic pressure was 108 +/- 2 mm Hg). Sinus node response to sustained (5 seconds) neck suction or pressure were strikingly asymmetrical. Responses were abolished by atropine, or by atropine and propranolol. Propranolol alone augmented sinus node responses to both neck suction and pressure. These results suggest that, in normal human subjects, sinus node responses to abrupt alterations of afferent baroreceptor traffic are nonlinear and are mediated by fluctuations of efferent cholinergic activity. Most of the observed nonlinear behavior of the integrated reflex can be explained on the basis of known properties of afferent and central portions of the baroreflex arc.", 
    "37": "The oral absorption and effectiveness of UM-272, (N,N-dimethylpropranolol), 40 or 60 mg/kg, were evaluated in dogs in which ventricular tachycardia was produced by the administration of ouabain. Although both dosages were effective in converting ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm, no relationship between plasma UM-272 concentrations and arrhythmia conversion or between UM-272 plasma concentrations and myocardial UM-272 concentrations was seen. The areas under the plasma concentration curve at conversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm were similar for both dosage groups with area under the plasma concentration curve proportional to myocardial UM-272 concentration. Myocardial UM-272 concentrations were significantly lower in those animals demonstrating a reappearance of ventricular tachycardia during insulin-induced hypokalemia. Peak plasma UM-272 concentrations were 6 times greater, total area under the plasma UM-272 concentration curve 3 times greater and myocardial UM-272 concentrations more than twice as great in the 60 mg/kg group. These results suggest that systemic availability of UM-272 after oral administration is limited by the presence of a saturable process and that tissue uptake of UM-272 is time-dependent as well as concentration-dependent with cardiac tissue concentrations rather than plasma concentrations determining antiarrhythmic activity.", 
    "38": "Electroencephalograms were recorded from scalp electrodes placed over the cerebral hemispheres of rats withdrawing from ethanol. The purpose was to investigate whether administration of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol changed the EEG during that condition. The animals were artificially ventilated with an air mixture of 70% N2O:30% O2 and PaO2 PaCO2 and mean arterial blood pressure were kept constant. There were no significant differences in EEG frequencies or amplitudes between abstinent animals and controls neither before nor 20 min. after intravenous administration of propranolol 2 mg/kg body weight. Similarly, there was no EEG changes during 3 min. of photic stimulation. It has been reported that electrophysiological abnormalities during physical ethanol dependence are generated in subcortical brain structures but the 4 day intoxication period used in the present study seems too short to involve the cerebral cortex.", 
    "39": "The effects of several local anesthetics and propranolol, a beta receptor antagonist with local anesthetic activity, on adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP) and arachidonic acid (AA)-induced aggregation were studied in rabbit platelets. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained from rabbits anesthetized with pentobarbital and changes in turbidity of PRP were measured with an aggregometer. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by the local anesthetics was expressed as the percent change in rate of aggregation from control value. Dibucaine was the most potent inhibitor of both AA- and ADP-induced aggregation. This inhibition was sensitive to external calcium concentration. In terms of potency dibucane > tetracine > lidocaine in inhibiting AA- and ADP-induced aggregation. Procaine was more effective against AA- than ADP-induced aggregation. Propanolol was comparable to the more potent local anesthetics. These data show that local anesthetics and propranolol inhibit both AA- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation and suggest that the mechanism of action is non-specific in nature.", 
    "40": "Fifty-eight patients with intraocular hypertension or primary open angle glaucoma participated in a double masked randomized study. Timolol in concentrations 0.25% and 0.5% was compared with 1, 2, or 4% pilocarpine Acetazolamide (250 mg x 3) was added if intraocular pressure (IOP) was uncontrolled with the highest concentrations tested. No statistical difference was found in hypotensive effect between pilocarpine and timolol neither on ocular hypertensions nor glaucomas. The additive hypotensive effect of acetazolamide was the same for both substances. Once a day by administration of timolol was sufficient in 17 of 20 cases controlled merely by topical administration.", 
    "41": "A single oral dose of 20 mg or 40 mg Penbutolol was given to two groups of ten untreated glaucoma patients. The drug significantly decreased intraocular pressure and was dose-related. The IOP response was paralleled with a decrease in pulse rate without significant effect on blood pressure. In another group 27 glaucoma patients, which were under sufficient IOP control following topical treatment with different antiglaucomatous agents, the daily peroral treatment with 40 mg Penbutolol did not result in a further decrease of IOP. However, a significant drop in pulse rate could be noted over the four weeks period of treatment in this series of patients. Blood pressure was, similar to the single does study, not significantly affected. Penbutolol treatment did not significantly change pupillary diameter, quantitative tear flow or corneal sensitivity. The potential usefulness of the drug in glaucomas with systemic hypertension or as additive treatment when topical treatment is insufficient is outlined.", 
    "42": "Metoprolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking drug, was given, with a placebo as an alternative, in a double-blind trial to 60 patients who were undergoing removal of third molar teeth under general anaesthesia. Dyshythmias occurred in significantly fewer patients in the metoprolol group than in the control group, and when ventricular dyshythmias occurred they were abolished in every case by the administration of metoprolol. It is concluded that metoprolol is effective in preventing cardiac dysrhythmias occurring during oral surgery carried out under general anaesthesia.", 
    "43": "Renal prostaglandins (PG) appear to mediate the release of renin due to activation of the intrarenal baroreceptor and stimulation of the renal sympathetic nerves. Since the vasodilator hydralazine is thought to stimulate renin release by both of these mechanisms, we examined the effect of indomethacin, a PG synthetase inhibitor, on hydralazine-induced renin release. Hydralazine increased the serum renin levels from 3.3 +/- 0.5 to 13.7 +/- 3.1 and 41.9 +/- 2.4 ng/ml/hr at the 1 and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Indomethacin inhibited this hydralazine-induced renin release by 100% at the 1 mg/kg dose and 36% at the 10 mg/kg dose even though the hypotensive effect of the drug was unaltered. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg) also suppressed urinary PGE2 excretion by 60% (p < 0.001). The beta-blocker, propranolol, was as effective as indomethacin in attenuating hydralazine-induced renin release. Additionally, propranolol blocked the tachycardia associated with hydralazine and slightly enhanced the hypotensive action of the drug. When indomethacin and propranolol were combined, no further inhibition of hydralazine-induced renin release was observed. Thus, renal PG's appear to be important as mediators of hydralazine-stimulated renin release but no hydralazine-induced vasodilatation."
