    "8": "Across a variety of adverse life circumstances, such as social isolation and low socioeconomic status, mammalian immune cells have been found to show a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) involving increased expression of proinflammatory genes. The present study examines whether such effects might stem in part from the selective up-regulation of a subpopulation of immature proinflammatory monocytes (Ly-6c(high) in mice, CD16(-) in humans) within the circulating leukocyte pool. Transcriptome representation analyses showed relative expansion of the immature proinflammatory monocyte transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from people subject to chronic social stress (low socioeconomic status) and mice subject to repeated social defeat. Cellular dissection of the mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptome confirmed these results, and promoter-based bioinformatic analyses indicated increased activity of transcription factors involved in early myeloid lineage differentiation and proinflammatory effector function (PU.1, NF-\u03baB, EGR1, MZF1, NRF2). Analysis of bone marrow hematopoiesis confirmed increased myelopoietic output of Ly-6c(high) monocytes and Ly-6c(intermediate) granulocytes in mice subject to repeated social defeat, and these effects were blocked by pharmacologic antagonists of \u03b2-adrenoreceptors and the myelopoietic growth factor GM-CSF.

    "17": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main liver-related cause of death in patients with compensated cirrhosis. The early phases are asymptomatic and the prognosis is poor, which makes prevention essential. We propose that non-selective beta-blockers decrease the incidence and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma via a reduction of the inflammatory load from the gut to the liver and inhibition of angiogenesis. Due to their effect on the portal pressure, non-selective beta-blockers are used for prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding. Recently, non-hemodynamic effects of beta-blockers have received increasing attention. Blockage of \u03b2-adrenoceptors in the intestinal mucosa and gut lymphatic tissue together with changes in type and virulence of the intestinal microbiota lead to reduced bacterial translocation and a subsequent decrease in the portal load of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This may reduce hepatic inflammation. Blockage of \u03b2-adrenoceptors also decrease angiogenesis by inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factors. Because gut-derived inflammation and neo-angiogenesis are important in hepatic carcinogenesis, non-selective beta-blockers can potentially reduce the development and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. Rodent and in vitro studies support the hypothesis, but clinical verification is needed. Different study designs may be considered. The feasibility of a randomized controlled trial is limited due to the necessary large number of patients and long follow-up. Observational studies carry a high risk of bias. The meta-analytic approach may be used if the incidence and mortality of hepatocellular carcinoma can be extracted from trials on variceal bleeding and if the combined sample size and follow up is sufficient.",

Furthermore, although increased VR heterogeneity (dispersion) may be important in the arrhythmogenicity in long QT syndrome, this hypothesis has not been evaluated in humans and cannot be tested by conventional electrocardiography. In contrast, vectorcardiography allows assessment of VR heterogeneity and is more sensitive to VR alterations than electrocardiography. Therefore, vectorcardiography was used to compare the electrophysiological phenotypes of two mutations in the LQT1 gene with different in vitro biophysical properties, and with LQT2 mutation carriers and healthy control subjects. We included 99 LQT1 gene mutation carriers (57 Y111C, 42 R518X) and 19 LQT2 gene mutation carriers. Potassium channel function is in vitro most severely impaired in Y111C. The control group consisted of 121 healthy subjects. QRS, QT, and T-peak to T-end (Tp-e) intervals, measures of the QRS vector and T vector and their relationship, and T-loop morphology parameters were compared at rest. Apart from a longer heart rate-corrected QT interval (QT heart rate corrected according to Bazett) in Y111C mutation carriers, there were no significant differences between the two LQT1 mutations. No signs of increased VR heterogeneity were observed among the LQT1 and LQT2 mutation carriers. QT heart rate corrected according to Bazett and Tp-e were longer, and the Tp-e-to-QT ratio greater in LQT2 than in LQT1 and the control group. In conclusion, there was a marked discrepancy between in vitro potassium channel function and in vivo electrophysiological properties in these two LQT1 mutations. Together with previous observations of the relatively low risk for clinical events in Y111C mutation carriers, our results indicate need for cautiousness in predicting in vivo electrophysiological properties and the propensity for clinical events based on in vitro assessment of ion channel function alone.",

Western blotting showed that the protein expression of MaxiK \u03b21- and \u03b1-subunit was significantly reduced with aging, and the suppression of \u03b21 subunits was larger than that of \u03b1 subunits. These data suggest that aging decreases capability of MaxiK channel in regulating vascular tone in the MA, which may be partially mediated by unparallel downregulation of \u03b1- and \u03b21-subunit expression.",

We hypothesized that PEs act directly at pituitary loci to attenuate basal FSH secretion and increase gonadotrope sensitivity to GnRH. To examine the effect of PEs on basal secretion and total production of FSH, ovine pituitary cells were incubated with PEs for 48\u200ah. Conditioned media and cell extract were collected and assayed for FSH. Estradiol (E\u2082) and some PEs significantly decreased basal secretion of FSH. The most potent PEs in this regard were coumestrol (CM), zearalenone (ZR), and genistein (GN). The specificity of PE-induced suppression of basal FSH was indicated by the absence of suppression in cells coincubated with PEs and an estrogen receptor (ER) blocker (ICI 182\u200a780; ICI). Secretion of LH during stimulation by a GnRH agonist (GnRH-A) was used as a measure of gonadotrope responsiveness. Incubation of cells for 12\u200ah with E\u2082, CM, ZR, GN, or daidzein (DZ) enhanced the magnitude and sensitivity of LH secretion during subsequent exposure to graded levels of a GnRH-A. The E\u2082- and PE-dependent augmentation of gonadotrope responsiveness was nearly fully blocked during coincubation with ICI. Collectively, these data demonstrate that selected PEs (CM, ZR, and GN), like E\u2082, decrease basal secretion of FSH, reduce total FSH production, and enhance GnRH-A-induced LH secretion in a manner that is dependent on the ER.",

Maps of cerebral blood flow (CBF), maximum oxygen extraction fraction (OEF(max)), and the resulting maximum cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2(max)) permitted by local hemodynamics, were calculated from raw CTP data.Sixty-five patients (median (interquartile range) age 70 (20)) were imaged at a median (interquartile range) time from onset to CTP of 9.8 (13.6)\u2009hours. Mean OEF(max) was elevated in the perihematoma region (0.44\u00b10.12) relative to contralateral tissue (0.36\u00b10.11; P<0.001). Perihematoma CMRO2(max) (3.40\u00b11.67\u2009mL/100\u2009g per minute) was slightly lower relative to contralateral tissue (3.63\u00b11.66\u2009mL/100\u2009g per minute; P=0.025).

We investigated the effects of menthol on gastric emptying and spontaneous- or evoked- mechanical activity of whole murine stomach. Gastric emptying was calculated after i.p. administration of menthol (50mg/Kg). Responses induced by menthol on gastric intraluminal pressure and evoked-cholinergic contractions were analyzed in vitro. Menthol decreased the gastric emptying rate. In vitro, menthol (0.3-30 mM) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of whole stomach, that was significantly reduced by tetrodotoxin or \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA. The gastric relaxant responses were not affected by N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of nitric oxide-synthase, apamin or [Lys1,Pro2,5,Arg3,4,Tyr6] vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)(7-28), a VIP receptor antagonist, but they were significantly antagonized by atropine or guanethidine, a blocker of adrenergic neurotransmission. The joint application of atropine and guanethidine did not produce any additive effects on menthol effects. Phentolamine, an \u03b1-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist, significantly reduced menthol responses and the contemporary administration of both adrenergic antagonists did not produce additive effects. Menthol (1-100 \u03bcM) produced a reduction of the electrically-evoked cholinergic contractions, which was prevented by guanethidine. Menthol did not affect the contractions induced by carbachol. In conclusion, menthol in mouse, is able to reduce the rate of gastric emptying and to relax the stomach in vitro. The latter effect appears due, almost in part, to neural mechanisms, with involvement of \u03b1-adrenoceptors leading to reduction of tonic ongoing release of acetylcholine.",

Coupling the flexible and wide working range of microfluidic chip-CE device to CCD for chiral separation of AN, AT, and ME in human urine, a total of 15 experiments is needed for the optimization procedure as compared to 75 experiments using the normal one variable at a time optimization. The optimum conditions obtained are found to be more robust as shown by the curvature effects of the interaction factors.

In this research project, we evaluated the cleaning efficiency of retention soil filters measuring the concentration ratio of standard wastewater parameters and bacteria according to factors limiting efficiency, such as long dry phases or phases of long-lasting retention. Furthermore, we conducted an initial investigation on how well retention soil filters reduce certain micropollutants on large-scale plants. There was little precipitation during the 1-year sampling phase, which led to fewer samples than expected. Nevertheless, we could verify how efficiently retention soil filters clean total suspended solids. Our results show that retention soil filters are not only able to eliminate bacteria, but also to retain some of the micropollutants investigated here. As the filters were able to reduce diclofenac, bisphenol A and metoprolol by a median rate of almost 75%, we think that further investigations should be made into the reduction processes in the filter. At this point, a higher accuracy in the results could be achieved by conducting bench-scale experiments.",

Because dermal blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerves, the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) and the co-transmitter adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) may regulate expression of EC inflammatory factors. We focused on IL-6 regulation because it has many inflammatory and immune functions, including participation in Th17 cell differentiation. Strikingly, NE and ATP synergistically induced release of IL-6 by a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). Adrenergic antagonist and agonist studies indicated that the effect of NE on induced IL-6 release is primarily mediated by \u03b22-adrenergic receptors (ARs). By real-time PCR IL-6 mRNA was also synergistically induced in HMEC-1 cells. This synergistic effect of NE and ATP was reproduced in primary human dermal endothelial cells (pHDMECs) and is also primarily mediated by \u03b22-ARs. Under conditions of stress, activation of the symphathetic nervous system may lead to release of ATP and NE by sympathetic nerves surrounding dermal blood vessels with induction of IL-6 production by ECs.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the residual variability of F of metoprolol in routinely treated Japanese patients and to investigate the intestinal absorption mechanism of the drug using human intestinal epithelial LS180 cells. We first re-analyzed the blood concentration data for metoprolol in 34 Japanese patients using a nonlinear mixed effects model. The oral clearance (CL/F) of metoprolol was positively correlated with the apparent volume of distribution (V/F), suggesting the residual variability of F. The uptake of metoprolol into LS180 cells was significantly decreased by the acidification of extracellular medium pH, and was dependent on temperature and intracellular pH. Furthermore, the cellular uptake of metoprolol was saturable, and was significantly decreased in the presence of hydrophobic cationic drugs such as diphenhydramine, procainamide, bisoprolol, and quinidine. These findings indicate that residual variability of F is one of the causes of the interindividual pharmacokinetic variability of metoprolol, and that the interindividual variability of not only presystemic first-pass metabolism, but also intestinal absorption, may be responsible for the variable F of the drug.",

During a median 2.5 years of follow-up, incident digoxin use was associated with higher rates of death (14.2 versus 11.3 per 100 person-years) and HF hospitalization (28.2 versus 24.4 per 100 person-years). In multivariable analysis, incident digoxin use was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-2.36) but no significant difference in the risk of HF hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-1.34).

We retrospectively reviewed the clinical charts, serial photographs, and radiologic images of children with rebound IH occurring after the age of 15 months after a successful course of oral propranolol averaging 2.6 mg/kg/day (range 2-3 mg/kg/day). Thirteen (10 female, 3 male) of 212 patients (6%) treated with oral propranolol since 2008 were evaluated. The mean age at the start of treatment was 5.3 months (range 1.8-13 months), and an average of 10.3 months (range 4.5-16 months) of treatment was given. It took an average of 5.3 months (range 1-13.8 months) for a significant rebound to appear. Late rebound after successful propranolol indicates a prolonged proliferation phase of IH even after 15 months of age. This is compared with previous reports of rebound, which occurred primarily in infants younger than 1 year old. Late proliferation can occur in localized, small, mixed, and deep IH, even after several months of a positive response to propranolol. A second course of propranolol readily controlled the recurrence.",

Most of the commonly used cell-based assays, however, lack the ability to measure in real-time or under dynamic conditions (e.g. constant flow). In this study a multi-parameter surface plasmon resonance approach in combination with living cell sensing has been utilized for monitoring drug-cell interactions in real-time, under constant flow and without labels. The multi-parameter surface plasmon resonance approach, i.e. surface plasmon resonance angle versus intensity plots, provided fully specific signal patterns for various cell behaviors when stimulating cells with drugs that use para- and transcellular absorption routes. Simulated full surface plasmon resonance angular spectra of cell monolayers were compared with actual surface plasmon resonance measurements performed with MDCKII cell monolayers in order to better understand the origin of the surface plasmon resonance signal responses during drug stimulation of cells. The comparison of the simulated and measured surface plasmon resonance responses allowed to better understand and provide plausible explanations for the type of cellular changes, e.g. morphological or mass redistribution in cells, that were induced in the MDCKII cell monolayers during drug stimulation, and consequently to differentiate between the type and modes of drug actions. The multi-parameter surface plasmon resonance approach presented in this study lays the foundation for developing new types of cell-based tools for life science research, which should contribute to an improved mechanistic understanding of the type and contribution of different drug transport routes on drug absorption.",

Protective strategies have been reported, but their impact on the antitumor activity of cisplatin has not been clarified. We have previously reported the protective potential of carvedilol against cisplatin nephrotoxicity in tumor-free rats. Therefore, in the present study we used a tumor-bearing model to investigate the impact of carvedilol on the antitumor activity of cisplatin. The renal damage induced by cisplatin and the protective effect of carvedilol were demonstrated by the levels of blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine as well as by renal histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The mechanism of protection was associated with significantly decreased (i) oxidative stress markers, (ii) Bax expression, (iii) caspase-3 activity and (iv) TUNEL labeling for apoptosis. More importantly, evaluation of tumor mass, tumor remission rate and the survival curve showed that carvedilol did not impair the antitumor action of cisplatin. These findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying the nephrotoxic and the antitumor activity of cisplatin might be different. This is the first study to report such findings. Compared to other reported potential cytoprotectors against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, carvedilol stands out due to the fact that it is already clinically-employed and well tolerated by the patients. Based on these features and on the present findings, carvedilol is a very promising candidate for future clinical trials as nephroprotector in patients treated with cisplatin.",

Atenolol, a hydrophilic selective beta-1 blocker, could be an alternative and associated with fewer side effects. Thirty consecutive patients with IH were treated with atenolol between June 2010 and May 2011. The therapeutic effect was judged by clinical assessment and quantified by using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Haemangioma Activity Score (HAS). Side effects were also evaluated. The atenolol cohort was compared with a previously described cohort of 28 patients treated with propranolol between July 2008 and December 2009. Clinical involution was present in 90% (27/30) of the IH patients treated with atenolol. Mild side effects occurred in 40% (12/30) of these patients and severe side effects occurred in 3% (1/30). Compared with the previously described cohort treated with propranolol, mild side effects occurred in 50% (14/28) and severe side effects in 25% (7/28) of the patients (p=0.04). Quantitative improvement of the IH in the atenolol group (n=27) showed no significant difference in either the VAS score or the HAS compared to the propranolol group (n=24). This study indicates that atenolol is effective in the treatment of IH. Compared with a historical control group treated with propranolol, the effects of atenolol seem to be similar and less frequently associated with severe side effects.

To determine the expression of ADBRs in vascular tumors, immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy were employed to determine the in situ cellular distribution of ADBRs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of IH-P, IH-NP, and NICH. In situ cellular proliferation, indexed by Ki-67 expression, distinguished IH-P (n = 3) from both IH-NP (n = 3) and NICH (n = 2). In IH-P, IH-NP, and NICH tumor sections, both ADBR1 and ADBR2 were co-localized in both endothelial cells (ECs; GLUT1(+) in IH; CD31+ in NICH) and pericytes (smooth muscle actin). We tentatively conclude that either EC and/or pericytes in IH-P could be target(s) of propranolol.

Renal denervation (DNx) in CHF patients has resulted in symptomatic improvement, but the protective mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized in CHF, unilateral renal DNx would improve cardiac autonomic balance. The present study used conscious, chronically instrumented New Zealand White rabbits undergoing renal DNx prior to pacing-induced CHF. Four treatment groups were used: nonpace, non-DNx [Sham-Innervated (Sham-INV)], nonpace DNx (sham-DNx), pace non-DNx (CHF-INV) or pace DNx (CHF-DNx). We examined several markers indicative of autonomic balance. Baroreflex sensitivity and time domain heart rate variability (HRV) were both decreased in the CHF-INV group compared with sham-INV and were restored to sham levels by renal DNx. Power spectral analysis indicated an increase in low-frequency/high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio in the CHF-INV compared with the sham-INV, which was normalized to sham levels by DNx. To assess whether this was due to a withdrawal of sympathetic tone or an increase in parasympathetic tone, the heart rate response was measured after an intravenous bolus of metoprolol or atropine. Bradycardia induced by intravenous metoprolol (indicative of cardiac sympathetic tone) was exacerbated in CHF-INV rabbits compared with sham-INV but was normalized in CHF-DNx. Conversely, the tachycardia in response to intravenous atropine (indicative of cardiac vagal tone) was not improved in CHF-DNx vs. CHF-INV animals. Renal DNx also prevented the increase in circulating plasma NE seen in CHF-INV rabbits. These results suggest renal DNx improves cardiac autonomic balance in CHF by a reduction of sympathetic tone.",

The objectives are to compare the effectiveness of common antihypertensive therapeutic classes initiated as monotherapy and of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs), free-equivalent combinations (FECs), and monotherapy on hypertension control.", 
    "224": "This article reports observational comparative effectiveness analyses of data electronically extracted from electronic health records. The study population consisted of 8,676 patients with an incident prescription for an antihypertensive agent of a total of 79,176 patients receiving antihypertensive therapy in 33 geographically diverse primary care clinics. The main measures were reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and rates of attaining goals per the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7).", 
    "225": "There were small, clinically insignificant differences in blood pressure reductions between the monotherapy classes. Higher rates of blood pressure control were obtained when patients were initiated on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor than a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (47.8% vs 39.9%) or a \u03b2-blocker versus a thiazide (45.9% vs 39.9%). Patients initiated on FDCs had significantly larger reductions in blood pressure than patients initiated on FECs (-17.3 vs -12.0 mm Hg SBP; -10.1 vs -6.0 mm Hg DBP) or monotherapy (-17.3 vs -13.6 mm Hg SBP; -10.1 vs -7.9 mm Hg DBP). Rates of attaining JNC7 goals also were better for FDCs than FECs (57.2% vs 42.5%) and for FDCs versus monotherapy (57.2% vs 44.9%).", 
    "226": "Patients initiated on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers had slightly higher rates of blood pressure control. The use of FDCs as initial therapy is more effective in the control of hypertension than monotherapy or FECs.", 
    "227": "Gingival enlargement is a fibrotic condition that can arise from systemic administration of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Periostin, a transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2)-inducible matricellular protein, has been associated with fibrosis in numerous tissues, but its expression has never been examined in nifedipine-influenced gingival enlargement (NIGE). The objective of this study was to assess if periostin up-regulation is associated with NIGE and whether nifedipine induces periostin expression in gingival fibroblasts. In NIGE tissue (n = 6), periostin is overexpressed in the gingival connective tissue compared with healthy control tissue (n = 6). The transcription factor p-SMAD2/3, which is associated with canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling, localizes to the nuclei in both HGFs and oral epithelial cells in NIGE tissues, but not in control healthy tissue. In vitro culture of HGFs with 30 and 100 ng/mL of nifedipine significantly increased periostin mRNA and protein levels, which correlated with increased levels of active TGF-\u03b2 and increased phosphorylation and nuclear localization of SMAD3. Blocking of canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling through inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 receptor I with SB431542 significantly reduced nifedipine-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation and periostin expression. Our results demonstrate that nifedipine up-regulates periostin in HGFs in a TGF-\u03b2-dependent manner."
