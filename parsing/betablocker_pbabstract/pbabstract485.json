    "0": "We assessed the effects of long-term antihypertensive treatment with 5 mg tertatolol, a noncardioselective beta-blocker, on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and diastolic function. Fifteen hypertensive patients were selected as good responders to previous treatment with tertatolol (supine blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg). They were divided into 2 groups: group 1 with LVH (n = 6) and group 2 without LVH (n = 9). After a one month wash-out period, all patients received 5 mg tertatolol once daily. In case of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), the dose was doubled after 2 weeks in 10 patients. BP control was obtained in all patients. M-mode echocardiography and Doppler-echocardiography were performed under controlled conditions after BP normalization and after 6 months of treatment. Long-term BP normalization significantly reduced left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in group 1 (from 137 +/- 3 to 121 +/- 3 g/m2, P less than .01), but not in group 2 (from 120 +/- 3 to 114 +/- 4 g/m2, P = NS). After 2 weeks of effective therapy, the ratio between early and late diastolic peak flow velocity across the mitral valve (E/A ratio), significantly increased in both groups (from 0.72 +/- 0.04 to 0.87 +/- 0.06 in group 1, P less than .05; and from 1.13 +/- 0.06 to 1.26 +/- 0.07 in group 2, P less than .05). After 6 months, together with the reduction of LVMI, a further increase of E/A ratio was only observed in group 1 (to 1.30 +/- 0.12, P less than .05).", 
    "1": "(1) LVH contributes to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in hypertensive patients since its reversal is able to improve diastolic filling, and (2) effective antihypertensive treatment with tertatolol improves diastolic function independently from its effect on LV mass.", 
    "2": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke and coronary heart disease and this increases with increasing age. It is a chronic disease which affects a quarter of the adult population. On its own or in conjunction with other risk factors, especially cigarette smoking, hypertension is associated with serious morbidity and high mortality. A large number of clinical trials have been undertaken to assess the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in controlling high blood pressure and in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. These trials have studied more than 40,000 subjects worldwide as a result of which the benefits of treatment even in milder forms of hypertension are well established today. However, antihypertensive therapy has been disappointingly unsuccessful in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease despite the undoubted protection against malignant phase hypertension, heart failure, stroke and renal failure as demonstrated in the early Veterans Administration trial and subsequent studies. The success of post-infarction beta-blockade suggested that the wider use of beta-blockers prophylactically might limit hypertension-related coronary disease. Taking into account the adverse and metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers together with calcium channel blockers must remain the drugs of choice as step one therapy in most patients with hypertension.", 
    "3": "Pharmacokinetics of tertatolol were investigated in 22 hypertensive patients (12 men and 10 women; mean age +/- SD: 52.6 +/- 12.3 years) with chronic renal failure defined by a mean creatinine clearance (Clcr) of 24.6 +/- 15.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range: 6.2 to 68.7). A daily single dose of 5 mg tertatolol was administered orally for 4 weeks, except in the 72 h following the first administration. Plasma samples and urine collections were carried out over 72 h after the first (D0) and the last dose (D27). After the first administration, tertatolol was rapidly absorbed (time to peak concentration: 1.2 +/- 0.7 h) and peak concentration was 160 +/- 80 ng/mL. Plasma concentrations decreased following a biphasic curve, with two half-lives of 2.5 +/- 1.1 and 17.0 +/- 8.5 h, respectively. These parameters were not modified by repeated administration of tertatolol and did not significantly correlate with Clcr either at D0 or at D27. Plasma levels were stable along the study with similar areas under plasma curves following the first and the last dose (P = NS). In addition, plasma levels extrapolated from first dose data did not significantly differ from those observed during repeated dosage. Plasma levels of the 4-OH metabolite which possesses a beta-blocking activity were low, inconstantly detectable, not related to the degree of renal impairment, and no accumulation occurred after chronic dosage. Renal excretion of tertatolol and 4-OH tertatolol was significantly increased by repeated administration (P less than .01) and correlated well with Clcr either at D0 or at D27. Four week treatment was well tolerated and significantly improved Clcr (+6.5%, P less than .02). In conclusion, tertatolol was well tolerated and did not accumulate in patients with renal failure of various degrees. The usual daily single dose of 5 mg may be kept unchanged whatever the degree of renal impairment.", 
    "4": "Tertatolol is a potent beta-blocker with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or beta 1/beta 2 receptor subtype selectivity. We provide evidence that tertatolol competitively inhibits beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-AR) and induces a marked and persistent reduction of their number. This has been consistently found in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro study showed that the receptor reduction by tertatolol was rapid (about 1 h at 37 degrees C), slowly reversible and independent of ISA. This effect was also observed in vivo. In healthy volunteers, seven days tertatolol treatment lowered the number of beta-AR by 26%. This number gradually rose back to the pretreatment levels, and a significant effect was still present on day 3 after drug withdrawal. The reduction of heart rate by tertatolol was also persistent and was still significant on day 3 to 5 after drug withdrawal. We conclude that the reduction of the receptor numbers may be important in producing a lack of a rebound effect after discontinuation of chronic tertatolol treatment.", 
    "5": "With a few notable exceptions, beta-receptor ligands (agonists and antagonists) belong to the aryl- or heteroaryl-ethanolamine series and to the aryl- or heteroaryl-oxypropanolamine series. Structure-activity relationships for beta-adrenergic agonists show that a secondary amine in the phenylethanolamine side chain ending is essential for receptor stimulation. The 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl groups may be replaced by \"phenol equivalents\" (-CH2OH, -NHCONH2, -CHOH, -NHSO2CH3). In contrast, substitution at carbon alpha of the phenyl-ethanolamine side chain decreases or suppresses beta-adrenergic activity. The general requirements for beta-adrenergic blocking activity in the aryl- or heteroaryl-oxypropanolamine are as follows: (1) the potency of beta-blockade is conferred by a branched alkyl group (isopropyl or tert-butyl) grafted on the terminal amino N, and by the nature and position of a substituent on the aromatic ring: ortho-substituted compounds (especially when they have an hetero-atom in alpha) are the most potent ones. (2) The cardioselectivity is improved by the attachment of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethyl,4-amide-substituted phenoxyethyl or acylamino-alkyl moieties to the terminal amino N of the side chain. Para substitution on the aromatic ring (particularly 4-acylamido substitution) has also yielded cardioselective drugs. Finally, the beta 1-selectivity is strongly and negatively correlated with lipophilicity. (3) Intrinsic sympathomimetic activity can be modulated by aromatic nucleus variations, particularly by hydroxyl-equivalents (electron withdrawing groups) on meta- and para-positions (3,4-substitutions).", 
    "6": "Renal perfusion has been shown to be preserved or improved during treatment by tertatolol in patients with arterial hypertension. The aims of the present study were (1) to document the central and renal hemodynamic effects of tertatolol in normal subjects and (2) to look for a possible interaction between tertatolol and products of the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Five mg of tertatolol, 1 g aspirin, 5 mg tertatolol together with 1 g aspirin, and placebo were administered to 8 healthy volunteers at 1 week intervals in a random order and in a double-blind fashion. Cardiac output was measured by cardiac Doppler echography and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate by constant infusion techniques using I123-iodohippurate and Cr51-EDTA respectively. Measurements were performed before and then successively 2 and 4 h after oral intake of drugs or placebo. Tertatolol alone or with aspirin significantly decreased heart rate and cardiac output (P less than .05) without change in blood pressure, renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate. The renal fraction of cardiac output was increased by tertatolol alone or with aspirin (P less than .05). Either placebo or aspirin alone had no effect. Thus tertatolol redistributes cardiac output to the kidneys in normal subjects as previously reported in hypertensive patients. This favorable effect on renal hemodynamics appers unlikely to be mediated by a local release of vasodilating prostaglandins.", 
    "7": "The different modes of antihypertensive action of beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs are reviewed with a special emphasis on renal mechanisms of action. Beta-adrenoceptors occur in the kidney at the level of the juxtaglomerular and tubular cells. Direct intrarenal effects of beta-blockers include the decrease in renin release and the enhanced tubular excretion of fluid and electrolytes. Beta-blockers also influence renal function in a more indirect way by altering the activity of different extrarenally formed hormones with an effect on fluid and electrolyte excretion, such as angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic factors and prostaglandins. Several beta-blockers have an additional effect on the renal vasculature. One of these, tertatolol, is a renal vasodilator beta-blocker in different species. The possible mechanisms of renal vasodilatation of tertatolol are reviewed. It is concluded that the shift of the renal pressure-diuresis curve is an essential feature in the mode of long-term antihypertensive action of beta-blockers.", 
    "8": "Renal hemodynamics of hypertensive patients are characterized by an increased renal vascular resistance (RVR), resulting in low renal plasma flow (RPF). Normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is maintained through an increased filtration fraction (FF). This pattern may have long term harmful consequences for the kidneys. Propranolol, given in the short- or long-term, lowers both RPF and GFR. Pindolol, as well as so called cardioselective beta-blockers and labetalol, alter renal hemodynamics only slightly, if not at all. In some studies, nadolol has been shown to increase RPF, leaving GFR unchanged. A new beta-blocker, tertatolol, seems to consistently increase RPF and GFR. These different renal actions of various beta-blockers are poorly explained. They may be, however, of clinical significance, in the short term for patients with already impaired renal function, and possibly over the long term for other hypertensive patients.", 
    "9": "Tertatolol, a new beta-adrenergic blocker, increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF), and enhances diuresis and natriuresis in experimental animals and humans. The mechanism underlying the renal effects of tertatolol has not been established. In the present study we addressed the possibility that tertatolol influences renal function by a direct intrarenal mechanism. For this purpose we used a preparation of isolated rat kidney perfused with an artificial cell-free medium. Tertatolol when given as a bolus injection into the renal artery at the dose of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg, but not of 12.5 micrograms/kg, significantly enhanced the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and perfusate flow rate (PFR). In contrast, the intrarenal bolus injection of different doses of propranolol (100, 250, or 500 micrograms/kg) was unable to change GFR and PFR to a significant extent. While no change in urine flow rate was found when the lowest dose of tertatolol was used, the compound at the dose of 25 and 50 micrograms/kg progressively increased urine flow during the time of perfusion. A similar effect of tertatolol was observed for urinary sodium and potassium excretion. In contrast, different doses of propranolol did not significantly change the urine flow rate or sodium and potassium excretion rates. We conclude that tertatolol, but not propranolol, increases GFR and PFR, and enhances urine output and sodium excretion in the isolated perfused rat kidney. These findings indicate that tertatolol preserves renal function by a mechanism independent of systemic changes.", 
    "10": "The aim of the studies summarized in the present review was to obtain a pharmacological characterization of the in vitro renal vasodilator action of tertatolol. In isolated Tyrode-perfused rat kidneys, previously constricted with norepinephrine, serotonin or BaCl2, tertatolol evokes vasodilatation. These dilator responses cannot be explained by an interaction of tertatolol with alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic or nicotinic receptors, opioid receptors, dopamine receptors or histamine receptors, and they occur independently of the release of prostaglandins. Since methylene blue, an inhibitor of the soluble form of guanylate cyclase, reduces the renal dilator effect of tertatolol, this action could ultimately depend, at least in part, on the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate; in this respect, the renal effects of tertatolol and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) are different. From experiments performed with canine renal arteries and with the perfused rat mesentery, it can be concluded that the effect of tertatolol is more pronounced at the level of the resistance vessels. The in vitro renal dilator response observed with tertatolol may help to explain the beneficial effect on the renal circulation observed in both humans and experimental animals treated with the compound.", 
    "11": "Administration of beta-blockers is frequently associated with decreases in both renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Tertatolol, a new non-selective beta-blocker, has demonstrated similar systemic effects to other conventional beta-blockers, but tertatolol produces increases in both renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. To evaluate the renal hemodynamic mechanism responsible for the increase in GFR, micropuncture experiments were performed in normal Munich-Wistar rats. Intravenous injection of tertatolol produced a significant increase in GFR and urinary sodium excretion in spite of a decrease in systemic blood pressure. Single nephron glomerular filtration rate was significantly increased due to an increase in single nephron plasma flow related to parallel afferent and efferent arteriolar dilatation. No significant changes in glomerular hydrostatic pressure, transcapillary hydrostatic pressure gradient or the ultrafiltration coefficient were demonstrated with tertatolol. The capacity of tertatolol to increase glomerular filtration rate and to promote sodium excretion without modifying critical glomerular pressures makes this agent a highly attractive antihypertensive drug.", 
    "12": "The decrease in left ventricular (LV) stroke volume during positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been attributed to reduced LV filling and a decreased contractile state. To assess the relative importance of each mechanism, we examined the effects of zero, 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O PEEP on LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV), and on LV contractile performance using instantaneous pressure-volume loops recorded with micromanometer-tipped and volume conductance catheters in the LV. The LV contractile state was determined using the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relations, the LV dP/dtmax-EDV relation, and the LV stroke work-EDV relation. The importance of autonomic reflexes was assessed by repeating the sequence of PEEP after beta-adrenergic blockade using metoprolol, 10 mg administered intravenously. LV EDV decreased from a baseline of 37.8 +/- 3.7 ml (+/- SEM) to 35.0 +/- 3.8, 28.7 +/- 2.9, and 25.9 +/- 2.6 ml with 5, 10, and 15 cm H2O PEEP, respectively (p less than 0.05 for each comparison), which paralleled the decline in stroke volume. In contrast, LV ESV did not change significantly with PEEP. The slope and position of the LV end-systolic pressure-volume relation and the slopes of the LV dP/dtmax-EDV relation and the LV stroke work-EDV relation (p = NS) were not altered during PEEP before or after beta-adrenergic blockade, indicating no depression of systolic contractile function. We conclude that the decreased LV stroke volume that occurs with PEEP is due to impaired LV filling (i.e., reduced LV EDV) without a concomitant depression of myocardial contractility.", 
    "13": "The apparently divergent changes in serum magnesium (S-Mg) and serum free fatty acids (S-FFA) in stress situations associated with elevated levels of circulating adrenaline were studied experimentally in 12 healthy volunteers, who were each given three adrenaline infusions (0.05 micrograms/kg bw/min over one hundred twenty minutes). Before the adrenaline infusions the volunteers were treated for three days with either a non-selective beta-blocking agent (propranolol) or a beta-1-selective agent (atenolol) or with placebo. Six of the volunteers underwent a fourth adrenaline infusion after pretreatment with a beta-2-selective beta-blocking agent (ICI 118551). S-Mg and S-FFA were determined every fifteen minutes. After pretreatment with placebo, adrenaline infusion caused an increase in S-FFA from 0.22 +/- 0.20 mmol/L (mean +/- SD) to max 0.59 +/- 0.39 mmol/L after thirty minutes of adrenaline infusion (p less than 0.001). At one hundred twenty minutes S-FFA had decreased to 0.35 +/- 0.26 mmol/L. Thirty minutes after cessation of the adrenaline infusion, S-FFA had returned to the same level as before the infusion. S-Mg before the adrenaline infusion was 0.83 +/- 0.05 mmol/L, rose to 0.85 +/- 0.05 at fifteen minutes, and then decreased to 0.78 +/- 0.05 at one hundred thirty-five minutes (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with atenolol did not change this pattern, although the changes in S-FFA and S-Mg were of a smaller magnitude but still statistically significant.", 
    "14": "Although esmolol may be a useful therapeutic agent in obstetrics and obstetric anesthesia, concerns about fetal safety have limited its use. To assess acute fetal hemodynamic effects of maternally administered esmolol, saline or esmolol (4-200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 in a stepped manner) was infused into maternal venous catheters in nine chronically prepared pregnant ewes, and the degree of beta-adrenergic blockade was assessed by isoproterenol challenge. In control experiments saline infusion and repeated isoproterenol challenges did not alter measured parameters, although maternally administered isoproterenol (0.1 micrograms) transiently decreased uterine blood flow by 20 +/- 5% (mean +/- SEM; P less than 0.05). Esmolol produced a dose-dependent decrease in maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate (maternal blood pressure decreased by 22 +/- 8% and fetal heart rate decreased by 27 +/- 7% following esmolol, 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1; P less than 0.05). Fetal arterial PO2 decreased from 18.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg before to 14.1 +/- 1.5 mmHg following esmolol, 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05). Maternally administered esmolol produced similar dose-dependent beta-adrenergic blockade in both ewe and fetus, with complete blockade following the 80 and 200 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 doses. Thirty minutes following cessation of esmolol infusion, fetal resting heart rate and maternal and fetal isoproterenol-stimulated heart rate remained below control values. These results suggest that maternally administered esmolol may produce adverse fetal effects, limiting its usefulness in the obstetric setting.", 
    "15": "Calcium antagonists are among the most potent and efficacious drugs used in the treatment of angina pectoris. Amlodipine, a new member of this family of dihydropyridines, has a unique pharmacokinetic profile with high bioavailability and an extended period of pharmacodynamic activity. In formal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with exercise tests carried out 24 hours after administration, amlodipine was significantly more effective than the placebo and comparable in efficacy with the calcium antagonist diltiazem and the beta-blocking drug nadolol. In addition to extending exercise capacity in patients with angina pectoris, amlodipine significantly reduces ECG evidence of myocardial ischemia. Amlodipine has also been found to be effective in reducing the anginal attack rate in patients with vasospastic angina. From the evidence available, it is concluded that once-daily treatment with amlodipine in the dose range of 5 to 10 mg is effective in improving exercise capacity and reducing anginal attack rate in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris and also those with vasospastic angina.", 
    "16": "The safety profile of amlodipine was assessed from the pooled data base of clinical research studies. This data base included 4227 subjects, 2495 of whom received amlodipine (including 2189 who received multiple-dose amlodipine); the remainder received comparative agents (placebo 1213; active comparatives 519). Amlodipine treatment was associated with a slightly higher incidence of side effects compared with placebo, but most of this difference was the result of edema, which was usually well tolerated. When compared with the beta-blockers atenolol and nadolol, amlodipine had a favorable safety profile. In particular, the incidence of severe side effects in patients receiving amlodipine was approximately half that reported for patients receiving beta-blockers. The data base comparing different calcium antagonists was small; in a study versus verapamil, edema was more common in patients receiving amlodipine, but constipation was more common in patients receiving verapamil. In a study versus diltiazem, both amlodipine and diltiazem were similarly well tolerated. Amlodipine was not associated with the deleterious effects of serum creatinine, urate, and fasting glucose, which was caused by hydrochlorothiazide, and in contrast to hydrochlorothiazide and nadolol, amlodipine was not associated with unfavorable changes in serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels. Amlodipine was well tolerated by elderly patients and is not contraindicated in patients with conduction abnormalities. Dosage modifications are unnecessary in renal impairment, but the dosage regimen for patients with hepatic impairment is not yet established. Amlodipine is an antihypertensive and antiischemic agent that has the combined advantages of a good safety profile with once-daily dosage and a smooth onset and long duration of action.", 
    "17": "To determine whether or not a training effect can be achieved with beta-adrenergic blockade and whether there is a difference between selective and nonselective therapy, we recruited 40 healthy subjects (16 women, 24 men) to participate in a 9-week exercise training program. After a baseline exercise treadmill test, subjects were randomized to oral therapy groups of atenolol, 50 mg daily (AT 50), atenolol, 100 mg daily (AT 100), propranolol, 80 mg twice a day (Prop), or placebo. Repeat exercise tests were performed at week 1, week 8, and at week 9, with week 8 to 9 being a 1-week drug-free washout period. At week 8, maximal oxygen consumption (Max VO2), when compared with baseline levels, was increased slightly in AT 50 (4.2%) and Prop (2.4%), decreased in AT 100 (5.3%), and increased significantly in the placebo group (12.7%). After washout, Max VO2 increased significantly compared with baseline in AT 50, AT 100, and Prop (9.8%, 10.8%, and 9.8%, respectively). We conclude that there is no significant difference between selective and nonselective beta-blockade therapy in the development of a training effect. This effect, however, may not become apparent until the drug is withdrawn.", 
    "18": "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are cardiovascular risk factors that commonly coexist. Studies have indicated that it is important to control both risk factors to achieve significant reductions in morbidity and mortality. Recent debate has focused upon whether traditional step I antihypertensive agents can substantially lower these risks because of their effects on plasma lipids. This debate continues to be unresolved. However, for the patient with elevated lipid levels, diuretics and beta-blockers may make the management of the lipid disorder more difficult. Therefore it may be desirable to select alternative step I antihypertensive agents that will not interfere with the therapy for hyperlipidemia. Alternative step I agents include alpha 1-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers. These agents either have no effect on plasma lipids or they improve the lipid profile. Generally, these drugs are well tolerated and provide good alternatives for patients with hyperlipidemias. The initial drug of choice can be chosen depending upon other patient variables such as age, race, or concomitant diseases.",

    "20": "Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs were administered either dl-propranolol, atenolol or dl-nebivolol at cumulative doses of 0 (vehicle), 0.0025, 0.01, 0.04, 0.16 and 0.64 mg/kg i.v. After each dose, heart rate and diastolic blood pressure responses to isoproterenol (0.125 micrograms/kg/min i.v. for 5 min), as well as plasma glucose, insulin, lactate and free fatty acid responses, were measured. Heart rate and free fatty acid changes were taken as beta-1 adrenergic indices, with the other parameters taken as beta-2 adrenergic indices. The antagonist dose estimated to cause 50% inhibition of each isoproterenol response (ID50) was calculated. Nebivolol and atenolol had nearly identical cardiovascular profiles, which were much more beta-1 selective than that of propranolol [heart rate and blood pressure ID50 values, mg/kg: 0.034, 0.036 (propranolol); 0.058, 0.713 (nebivolol); 0.047, 0.506 (atenolol)]. Propranolol also potently inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated glucose, insulin and lactate increases (ID50S: 0.020, 0.078 and 0.007 mg/kg, respectively). Nebivolol and atenolol were much weaker inhibitors of these metabolic responses than propranolol (5-fold-35-fold and 8-fold-greater than 90-fold, respectively). Insulin responses were equivalently inhibited by both nebivolol and atenolol (ID50S greater than 0.4 mg/kg), whereas glucose and lactate ID50S for nebivolol were 0.183 and 0.243 mg/kg, respectively, with atenolol ID50S greater than 0.64 mg/kg. Free fatty acid responses were attenuated by all three antagonists with ID50 values of 0.103, 0.100 and 0.028 mg/kg for propranolol, nebivolol and atenolol, respectively. These in vivo studies demonstrate that dl-nebivolol significantly inhibited the beta-1 cardiac response at doses which did not produce either beta-2 cardiovascular or metabolic effects.", 
    "21": "The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory effects of the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist celiprolol were evaluated in a chronic canine model of myocardial infarction and sudden death. Programmed electrical stimulation (PES) was performed in conscious animals 3 to 5 days after a 2-hr occlusion/reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Dogs in which PES resulted in a reproducible nonsustaining or sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were randomized to receive i.v. celiprolol (3 mg/kg, n = 10) or vehicle (n = 10). PES and measurement of electrophysiologic (parameters were repeated after 30 min and the animals were entered into the sudden death protocol by introducing a 150-microA anodal current to the lumen of the left circumflex coronary artery via a surgically implanted silver wire electrode. Celiprolol failed to prevent the induction of VT, and the outcome of the sudden death protocol did not differ from vehicle with respect to either sudden (within 1 hr of ischemia) or delayed (greater than 1 hr) mortality. VT cycle length and ventricular refractoriness were prolonged (P less than .05) by celiprolol, but other electrophysiologic parameters were unaffected. Heart rate was not altered after drug, but celiprolol antagonized the ischemia-induced increase in rate seen in the vehicle group. Similar electrophysiologic results and mortality data were apparent in a third group of dogs which received pindolol (0.09 mg/kg, n = 8). The failure of both drugs to protect against ischemic ventricular fibrillation in a model in which beta adrenoceptor antagonism has previously proved beneficial may be due in part to related cardiostimulant properties shared by celiprolol and pindolol.", 
    "22": "In a placebo controlled double-blind cross-over study following a dose titration phase, we compared the efficacy of benantolol, a new beta 1 adrenoceptor antagonist with alpha-adrenoceptor partial antagonist activity at 12 and 24 hours after dosing in patients with angina of effort. Twenty patients aged 43-65 years were studied. Each study phase lasted four weeks. Efficacy was determined by treadmill exercise testing using the standard Bruce protocol at the end of each phase. Fifteen patients satisfactorily completed the study. Data from five protocol violators were not analysed. In the four patients who received bevantolol 200 mg daily, exercise time increased from 395 +/- 192 (mean +/- 1 SD) sec on placebo to 468 +/- 171 sec at 10-12 hours and to 442 +/- 230 sec at 22-24 hours after dosing with bevantolol. In the eleven patients who received bevantolol 400 mg daily, exercise tolerance of 290 +/- 103 sec on placebo increased to 408 +/- 112 sec at 10-12 hours (P = 0.001) and to 400 +/- 98 sec at 22-24 hours (P = 0.001) after dosing with bevantolol. Maximum exercise capacity at 10-12 and 22-24 hours after dosing with bevantolol were comparable. Maximum exercise heart rate and systolic blood pressure on placebo and on bevantolol at 10-12 and at 22-24 hours after dosing were comparable. Thus, bevantolol has salutary effects on exertional angina up to 24 hours after dosing.", 
    "23": "The role of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the development of catecholamine-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo was investigated. Rats received a constant intravenous infusion of norepinephrine or sodium chloride (control) for 3 days. The norepinephrine infusion was combined with the alpha-blocker prazosin, the beta-blocker metoprolol, or both blockers. For modulation of the work load of the heart, the calcium channel blocker verapamil was added to the norepinephrine infusion. A further group of animals was treated with the alpha-adrenergic stimulator norfenephrine, which also was combined with prazosin or verapamil. Norepinephrine induced significant increases in mean aortic pressure, left ventricular dP/dtmax, heart rate, and total peripheral resistance. The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio was significantly elevated and was accompanied by an increase in the RNA concentration and the RNA/DNA ratio. Prazosin as well as metoprolol partially antagonized the increase in left ventricular weight and RNA concentration, whereas simultaneous prazosin and metoprolol treatment prevented the norepinephrine-induced alterations. Although combination of norepinephrine with verapamil resulted in considerable reduction of all functional parameters, the development of cardiac hypertrophy and the elevated RNA/DNA ratio were not significantly influenced. Stimulation of alpha-receptors with norfenephrine elicited an increase in total peripheral resistance and in left ventricular weight, which was abolished by prazosin. Verapamil did not affect the norfenephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy, although it normalized essentially all functional parameters. Thus, the rapid development of cardiac hypertrophy in the norepinephrine model seems to be directly mediated by stimulation of myocardial alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors rather than by hemodynamic changes.", 
    "24": "Previous studies have shown that norepinephrine causes a marked increase in the iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase activity in dispersed brown adipocytes. This stimulation required mRNA and protein synthesis and was 3- to 4-fold greater in cells from hypothyroid than in those from euthyroid rats. To investigate the cause of this differential response, we incubated dispersed brown adipocytes with catecholamines, a specific alpha 1-agonist, forskolin, and (Bu)2cAMP alone and in combination. Our results show a synergistic effect of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic catecholamines to increase the deiodinase, which leads to 2-fold (euthyroid) to 4-fold (hypothyroid) higher enzyme activities in the presence of both agonists than can be accounted for by additive effects of the two agents. Since alpha 1-agonists cause minimal stimulation alone, this response is due to an enhancement of the cAMP effect. The alpha 1 effect is mimicked by the calcium ionophore A23187, but not by phorbol ester alone. After 2-h exposure to beta-adrenergic agents or forskolin, hypothyroid cells had a reduced cAMP response, but alpha 1-agonists did not reverse this. These results demonstrate a complex interrelationship between alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic agonists and thyroid status in the regulation of deiodinase in the brown adipocyte. The increase in intracellular calcium due to an alpha 1-agonist markedly enhances the effects of cAMP on deiodinase activation, permitting a beta-adrenergic effect despite the impaired cAMP generation characteristic of hypothyroid adipocytes. This unexpected enhancement of the beta-adrenergic pathway in the hypothyroid state may be especially relevant for maintaining maximum T3 production, which is required for the normal thermogenic function of this tissue.", 
    "25": "The beta-adrenoceptors in the muscular tissue of Anodonta cygnea have been studied for the first time with the use of antagonist [125I] iodocyanopindolol. The tissue membrane had only one class of binding sites with Kd 2.9 +/- 0.02 pM and the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) 110 +/- 2.4 fmoles/mg of protein. The potency of beta-agonists and antagonists for displacing [125I] iodocyanopindolol for its beta-AR complexes was the following: isoproterenol greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline-propranolol greater than serotonin much greater than dopamine greater than phentolamine. The GTP negative regulation of beta-AR affinity has been found. The data obtained show that the beta-AR are functionally coupled with GTP-binding protein which were similar to GTP-proteins of vertebrates.", 
    "26": "The effects of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline, on Ca2+ mobilization and inositol phosphate formation in parotid acinar cells were examined. Isoprenaline (2 microM) failed to increase cytosolic [Ca2+] in acinar cells, as measured by Fura-2 fluorescence, even in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Likewise, neither the 8-bromo nor the dibutyryl derivatives of cAMP (both at 2 mM concentration) increased [Ca2+]i. However, in confirmation of results previously published, a higher concentration of isoprenaline (200 microM) increased cytosolic [Ca2+]i of rat parotid acinar cells, from 104 +/- 4 nM to 151 +/- 18 nM. The increase in [Ca2+]i in response to isoprenaline, while transient in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, was sustained in Ca2(+)-containing medium. This isoprenaline-stimulated Ca2+ signal was more potently antagonized by phentolamine than by propranolol, suggesting that the higher concentration of isoprenaline activated alpha-adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the Ca2+ signal generated in response to the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, also was blocked by the same concentrations of propranolol necessary to block the effects of isoprenaline, suggesting that propranolol may block alpha-adrenoceptors under certain experimental conditions. The high concentration of (-)isoprenaline (200 microM) also increased inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate and inositol (1,3,4) trisphosphate formation 45% within 30 s. Analogous to the increase in intracellular Ca2+, the formation of inositol phosphates stimulated by isoprenaline was more potently antagonized by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, than by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, again suggesting that isoprenaline interacts with alpha-adrenoceptors on parotid cells. Thus, the effects of isoprenaline on [Ca2+]i do not appear to be mediated by cAMP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The effects of the three inhalation anaesthetics enflurane, isoflurane and halothane were tested in vitro on accommodation of rat CA1 neurones. At near clinical concentrations (approximately 2.5%) the anaesthetics slightly depressed antidromic field potential responses. At the same concentrations the anaesthetics also blocked accommodation reversibly and reduced the after hyperpolarization of CA1 neurones. No significant changes in the threshold potential were observed, although the resting membrane potential was often increased in the presence of the anaesthetics. The action of enflurane was not blocked by propranolol 20 mumol litre-1 and enflurane had no obvious effect on the duration of Ca2+ spikes of CA1 neurones. It is concluded that the anaesthetics may have a direct effect on membrane K+ channels such as the Ca2+-activated K+ conductance and that the block of accommodation is unlikely to account for the proconvulsant action of enflurane.", 
    "28": "We have investigated the effect of mineralocorticoids on beta-adrenergic receptors in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells. Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) treatment resulted in a significant increase in beta-adrenergic receptors measured by [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding. This effect required at least 20 hours of incubation with aldosterone and was completely blocked by cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml), indicating protein synthesis was required for this response. Aldosterone at the concentration range of 10(-8)-10(-6) M increased [3H]DHA binding, but was ineffective at 10(-9) M. Scatchard analysis of [3H]DHA binding revealed that the observed significant increase in binding was due to an increased number of binding sites (P less than 0.05), and that the affinity was unchanged. The aldosterone (1 x 10(-8) M) effect was completely blocked by the combination of RU 38486 (10(-6) M) and spironolactone (10(-7) M), but not by the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 38486 alone. While basal c-AMP levels were not changed by aldosterone (10(-6) M) treatment, the isoproterenol (10(-6) M) stimulated level of c-AMP was significantly higher in cells treated with aldosterone (P less than 0.05). We conclude that aldosterone, acting through the mineralocorticoid receptor, has a direct effect on arterial smooth muscle cells mediated through modulation of beta-adrenergic receptors of these cells.", 
    "29": "A series of three experiments were performed on healthy adult volunteers to investigate the possible role played by beta-adrenoreceptor mediated pathways in the disturbance of human upper intestinal motor function by hand immersion in cold water. In the first experiment, (an extended pilot study on one individual), orocaecal transit of a standard meal was measured on 36 occasions with and without cold water stimulation and with and without a series of alpha and beta blocking drugs. Cold water stimulation consistently delayed transit in this individual, an effect which was attenuated by prior beta-blockade. In a double blind trial of the effect of beta-blocker atenolol v placebo on transit in nine individuals, a consistent reduction in the cold water induced transit delay was observed (p less than 0.01) independent of any direct effect of beta-blockade. In the third experiment seven individuals underwent repeated studies of antroduodenal pressure activity comparing the effects of cold and warm water stimulation with and without beta blockade to determine whether the observed transit effect could be related to an action on gastrointestinal motility. Cold water stimulation reduced antroduodenal motility, but no consistent effects of previous beta blockade were noted. These studies indicate the presence of a beta-adrenoreceptor mediated pathway in the cold water induced delay of orocaecal transit but not in the inhibition of gastroduodenal motility. Further studies are indicated to determine the site and mode of action of this transit effect more precisely.", 
    "30": "Parotid glands were stimulated to growth by repeated injection of the beta-agonist isoprenaline into rats. Incubation of intact parotid-gland lobules with [32P]Pi and subsequent analysis of nuclear proteins revealed in the stimulated glands an increased 32P incorporation into two acid-soluble non-histone proteins with apparent Mr values of 110,000 and 130,000 (p110 and p130). After a single injection of isoprenaline, leading to a biphasic increase in DNA synthesis (maximum at 24 h), the same two proteins showed a transiently increased 32P incorporation at 17 h after injection. At this time point at the onset of DNA synthesis the total activity of soluble cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase decreased. No change in p110/p130 phosphorylation was observed at 0.3 h after stimulation, a time of maximal stimulation of secretion. Administration of the beta-antagonist propranolol 8 h after the injection of isoprenaline suppressed the increase in DNA synthesis, the preceding changes in the concentration of cyclic AMP and in the activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, as well as the increased phosphorylation of p110 and p130. Cross-reactivity of p110 and p130 with specific antisera against two nucleolar phosphoproteins of similar molecular mass (nucleolin and pp135), as well as their localization in a nucleolar cell fraction, indicated a possible identity of p110 and p130 with these two proteins. Our results suggest that nucleolin and pp135 are nuclear target proteins of cyclic AMP in the cyclic AMP-influenced regulation of the transition of cells from the G1 to the S phase.", 
    "31": "Systemic administration of isoprenaline to rats produced a dose-dependent increase in water drinking which was effectively blocked by propranolol. This dipsogenic effect was significantly inhibited by the subacute (4 days) administration of imipramine (18.1 mg/kg/day) together with either the H1-histamine receptor antagonist, chlorpheniramine (0.1 or 1.32 mg/kg/day), or the H2-histamine antagonist, cimetidine (1.91 mg/kg/day) or ranitidine (0.60 or 1.51 mg/kg/day). The oral subacute administration of imipramine alone had no significant effect on this behavior. However, chronic ingestion of imipramine alone (21 days) caused a significant reduction in the isoprenaline-induced behavior. It is concluded that the desensitization of central beta-adrenoceptors, as evidenced by inhibition of isoprenaline-induced drinking, can be accelerated following the oral subacute co-administration of imipramine with either H1- or H2-histamine receptor antagonists. It is also seems the central histamine receptors may partially contribute towards the mechanism of antidepressant effect of imipramine.", 
    "32": "The ability of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, to attenuate the thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability was examined by measuring 125I-labeled albumin clearance across endothelial cell monolayers. Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (CCL-209) were grown to confluence on gelatinized, polycarbonate micropore filters and mounted on modified Boyden chambers with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. alpha-Thrombin at 0.2 nM to 2 microM produced a dose-related increase (P less than 0.01) in 125I-labeled albumin clearance from the DMEM control value. Light and electron microscopy revealed that the thrombin-induced increase in permeability correlated with changes in cell shape and rearrangement of filamentous actin. Coincubation of 2 microM isoproterenol with 2 microM alpha-thrombin reduced (P less than 0.01) the thrombin-induced increase in albumin clearance and the observed morphological changes. This attenuation was not caused by inhibition of thrombin's enzymatically active site, since isoproterenol did not impair thrombin's fibrinogen clotting activity nor its amidolytic cleavage of an artificial substrate (Spectrozyme-TH). Coincubation of 20 microM propranolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, with 2 microM isoproterenol and thrombin blocked the permeability-decreasing effect of isoproterenol. Both 2 microM isoproterenol and 2 pM alpha-thrombin alone decreased (P less than 0.01) albumin clearance below the DMEM control value. These results suggest that isoproterenol can reduce the thrombin-induced increase in endothelial permeability in vitro by directly maintaining actin filaments and the shape of endothelial cells.", 
    "33": "Adipocytes from streptozotocin-diabetic rats showed a markedly reduced lipolytic response to glucagon concomitant with a 90% or greater decrease in the number of glucagon receptors per cell. In contrast, beta-adrenergic receptors assessed by [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding and lipolysis stimulated by isoproterenol, dibutyryl 3'5'-cyclic AMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were reduced by only 10-25% in diabetic rats compared with controls. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the relationship between the amount of cell-bound glucagon and the hormone-stimulated lipolysis revealed that the function of the remaining 10% of glucagon receptors remained intact in cells from diabetic animals. These findings suggest that the lipolytic cascades, including beta-adrenergic receptors, in adipocytes are not greatly impaired by diabetes, and therefore, the unresponsiveness of these cells to glucagon is mostly due to a marked reduction in the number of glucagon receptors, probably as a result of a down-regulation by postprandial hyperglucagonemia.", 
    "34": "The autoradiographic distribution and density of beta-adrenoceptors in human non-diseased and asthmatic bronchi were investigated using [125I]iodocyanopindolol (I-CYP). Analysis of the effects of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists on I-CYP binding demonstrated that betaxolol (20 nM, beta 1-selective) had no significant effect on specific grain density in either nonasthmatic or asthmatic human bronchus, whereas ICI-118551 (20 nM, beta 2-selective) inhibited I-CYP binding by 85 +/- 9% and 89 +/- 3%, respectively. Thus, homogeneous populations of beta 2-adrenoceptors existed in bronchi from both sources. Large populations of beta-adrenoceptors were localized to the bronchial epithelium, submucosal glands, and airway smooth muscle. Asthmatic bronchial tissue featured epithelial damage with exfoliated cells associated with luminal mucus plugs. A thickened basement membrane and airway smooth muscle hyperplasia were also evident. High levels of specific I-CYP binding were also detected over asthmatic bronchial smooth muscle, as assessed by autoradiography and quantitation of specific grain densities. Isoproterenol and fenoterol were 10- and 13-fold less potent, respectively, in bronchi from asthmatic lung than in those from nonasthmatic lung. However, this attenuated responsiveness to beta-adrenoceptor agonists was not caused by reduced beta-adrenoceptor density in asthmatic airways. A defect may exist in the coupling between beta-adrenoceptors and postreceptor mechanisms in severely asthmatic lung.", 
    "35": "A randomized, parallel, controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of isradipine, 2.5 to 10 mg orally twice a day, compared with propranolol hydrochloride, 60 to 240 mg orally twice a day, in 78 hypertensives whose supine diastolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mm Hg while receiving 50 mg/d or more of hydrochlorothiazide. Isradipine or propranolol was titrated during a 10-week double-blind phase to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg while a fixed dose of hydrochlorothiazide was maintained. Supine diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 10 mm Hg in 88% of the isradipine/hydrochlorothiazide-treated and 83% of the propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide-treated groups and to less than 90 mm Hg in 55% of the isradipine/hydrochlorothiazide-treated and 69% of the propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide-treated patients. There was no significant difference in supine blood pressure reduction between either group, but there was a 3-to 4-beats per minute increase in supine heart rate in isradipine-treated patients and an expected 15- to 20-beats per minute decrease in heart rate in propranolol-treated patients. Five of 7 patients in the isradipine-treated group and 8 of 9 patients in the propranolol-treated group discontinued the therapy because of adverse reactions or treatment failure. Using Fisher's Exact Test, we found no significant difference in the relative frequency of individual adverse reactions between groups, although the absolute adverse reaction frequency was significantly higher with isradipine. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of supplemental isradipine in the treatment of hypertension not controlled by hydrochlorothiazide alone.", 
    "36": "A middle-aged woman with long-term uncontrolled arterial hypertension developed a clinical picture of impending myocardial infarction. A normal coronary arteriogram was obtained. However, left heart catheterization showed a marked increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, while left angiocardiography revealed marked left ventricular hypertrophy. She was successfully treated with a beta-blocking and calcium-antagonist agent. The present case shows that an impending myocardial infarction may occur in patients having normal coronary arteriogram but with left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to arterial hypertension.", 
    "37": "The effects of dietary salt on circulating levels of 1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16 PAF) in patients with essential hypertension were studied by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with negative ion chemical ionization. Circulating levels of C16 PAF in patients with essential hypertension (18.1 +/- 5.3 pg/ml, n = 16) were not changed compared with those in normotensive subjects (17.2 +/- 7.2 pg/ml, n = 14). Although changes in circulating levels of C16 PAF were small with changes in dietary salt, net changes in circulating C16 PAF levels significantly and positively correlated with net changes in mean arterial blood pressure (r = 0.47, P less than 0.05). Changes in C16 PAF levels also correlated with changes in creatinine clearance (r = 0.55, P less than 0.05). However, changes in C16 PAF levels did not correlate with changes in plasma sodium concentration, plasma chloride concentration and plasma volume. These results indicate that C16 PAF plays an antihypertensive role and this may be reflected as small changes in circulating levels of C16 PAF.", 
    "38": "Since most of the toxicity associated with class 1B antiarrhythmic drugs is dose-related, this review examines adverse effects seen in both therapeutic practice and accidental or premeditated overdose. Toxicity is very common with these agents and can be life-threatening. A high percentage of patients must discontinue therapy because of adverse effects. Mexiletine and tocainide are structural analogues of lignocaine (lidocaine) and toxicity is similar with all 3 drugs. With gradual intoxication (the most common form) central nervous system effects such as lightheadedness, dizziness, drowsiness and confusion are seen first. Seizures and respiratory arrest can occur. Cardiovascular toxicity is manifested by progressive heart block, reduced cardiac contraction, hypotension and asystole. Both mexiletine and tocainide may have proarrhythmic effects. Gastrointestinal toxicity is also common. Shock, hypotension, cardiac failure and beta-blocker therapy reduce lignocaine clearance and enhance the risk of intoxication during routine therapy. Both lignocaine and mexiletine elimination is impaired in severe liver disease while tocainide clearance is reduced in renal failure. Management of toxicity is largely supportive and symptomatic. Lignocaine infusion must be discontinued and decontamination of the gut in the case of oral preparations is recommended. Serious intoxication requires intensive care unit admission. Haemodialysis or haemoperfusion may be helpful in serious lignocaine and tocainide poisoning. In institutions where extracorporeal circulatory assistance is available, massive lignocaine poisoning has been successfully treated with this intervention. In the therapeutic setting serious toxicity can be prevented by close clinical surveillance and appropriate dose reduction in patients with reduced drug clearance. Because of the large interindividual variation in lignocaine pharmacokinetic parameters, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended if results can be reported quickly. Mexiletine and tocainide have stereoselective metabolism and assays do not distinguish the more active isomers. Therapeutic drug monitoring is less useful in this situation.", 
    "39": "1. The effects of adding slow release nifedipine in doses of 20 mg and 40 mg twice daily to atenolol therapy (50 mg twice daily) were assessed in 18 patients with chronic stable angina. 2. The addition of the lower dose of nifedipine to atenolol did not significantly alter the weekly consumption of glyceryl trinitrate or the mean number of anginal attacks as assessed by diary cards. However, 2 h after dosing there was a significant prolongation during stress testing in the time to onset of both 1 mm ST depression on the ECG (by 28%) and to angina (by 37%) compared with atenolol alone, but no benefit was apparent by 12 h after dosing. 3. At a dose of 40 mg twice daily, nifedipine significantly reduced glyceryl trinitrate consumption by 25% and the number of anginal attacks by 36%. The times to onset of ST depression and angina were increased by 37% and 55% respectively at 2 h and by 24% and 26% respectively 12 h after dosing. 4. Analysis of the frequency distribution of anginal attacks showed decreasing efficacy with time after administration of nifedipine. The overall results also suggest a relationship between efficacy and the plasma nifedipine concentration, with a mean 20% improvement in time to development of angina occurring at a nifedipine plasma concentration of approximately 30-40 ng ml-1. 5. In conclusion, the reduction of effort-related angina by nifedipine is related to its plasma concentration and the effective duration of action of the 20 mg slow release formulation is less than 12 h.", 
    "40": "The modulation of the effects of sotalol (30 microM) by two sodium channel blockers, tetrodotoxin (0.07 microM) and lidocaine (50 microM), and by a potassium channel activator, nicorandil (30 microM), were examined. Sotalol alone greatly increased Purkinje fiber transmembrane action potential duration and, in some preparations, induced early after depolarizations. Concurrent with the changes in action potential duration, sotalol also increased isolated Purkinje strand developed force paced at slow rates (0.33 Hz). These sotalol-induced alterations of Purkinje strand electromechanical characteristics were similar to those produced by either veratrine (0.6 or 1.0 micrograms/mL) or by tetraethylammonium (10 mM). The effects of sotalol on action potential duration and force development were reversed by exposure to either tetrodotoxin or nicorandil. Lidocaine also reversed the effects of sotalol on action potential duration and developed force. The sotalol-induced increase in action potential duration and development of early after depolarizations may, therefore, be abated by combination with drugs that either block cardiac sodium channels or that increase membrane potassium conductance. Combination with such drugs may help prevent the adverse arrhythmogenic effects of sotalol.", 
    "41": "The direct and reflex-mediated components of the cardiovascular response to administration of neuro-peptide Y (NPY) in intact conscious rabbits were determined by studies with cardiac beta adrenoceptor and vagal blockade, and during total autonomic blockade. Cardiac pacing was used to prevent bradycardia, and sinoaortic denervation (SAD) was used to remove afferent baroreflex input. In control animals, NPY (10 micrograms/kg bolus i.v.) caused arterial pressure to increase from 77.4 +/- 1.5 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to a maximum of 91.4 +/- 1.6 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). This pressor response was independent of autonomic effectors but was buffered by arterial baroreflexes. The fall in heart rate (HR) from 281 +/- 14 to 252 +/- 18 beats/min (p less than 0.05) was mediated in part through baroreceptor-dependent changes in cardiac autonomic efferent activity, but was in part independent of autonomic neural mechanisms. Peak left ventricular (LV)dP/dt fell from 5,551 +/- 342 to 4,182 +/- 394 mm Hg/s (p less than 0.05) following NPY in control rabbits. This reduction was maintained during pacing and following SAD, and was caused partly by a withdrawal of cardiac beta-adrenergic tone and partly through a non-beta-mediated myocardial depression. Small changes in cardiac output (CO) and in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) after NPY were secondary to bradycardia. Total autonomic blockade did not impair the NPY-induced rise in total peripheral resistance (TPR), suggesting a direct vasoconstrictor action that was independent of neural mechanisms.", 
    "42": "The effects of the dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonist, nicardipine, on central cardiovascular regulation were investigated by injecting it into the cisterna magna or directly into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), in anesthetized normotensive or spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Intracisternal injections of nicardipine (1-10 micrograms/kg) dose-dependently decreased blood pressure in SHR; there was no significant change in cardiovascular parameters in normotensive rats. In SHR, nicardipine (100 ng) microinjected bilaterally into the NTS produced hypotension and bradycardia. The same doses of nicardipine intravenously injected did not change either parameter. Previous administration of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, tertatolol (50 micrograms/kg i.v.), prevented the nicardipine-induced bradycardia and hypotension after injection into the NTS. These data suggest that part of the central cardiovascular effects of nicardipine result from an interaction with DHP sites within the NTS leading to a withdrawal of the sympathetic tone.", 
    "43": "Hypokalaemia (HK) is a risk factor for development of clinical arrhythmias, and epinephrine (Epi), released after myocardial infarction, may itself induce HK. The effects of selective beta 1- and beta 2-blockade with metoprolol (M) and ICI 118551 (I), respectively, and non-selective blockade with propranolol (P) against early ischaemia-induced arrhythmias were therefore compared in normokalaemic (NK) and dietary-induced HK rats. Plasma Epi, norepinephrine (NE), and K+ levels were also measured. All three blockers [5-10 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.)] were antifibrillatory in NK rats, whereas I and P (2-10 mg/kg) additionally reduced the number of ventricular premature beats. Coronary artery ligation increased plasma Epi levels in both NK an HK rats, but plasma NE increased further in HK rats. HK was also associated with an increased arrhythmia severity and negation of the antifibrillatory action of M. In contrast, I and P retained antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory effects in HK animals and increased survival. Both I and P increased plasma K+ levels in both NK and HK animals whereas M did not. We concluded that beta 2-receptor-mediated HK after coronary occlusion may play a substantial role in arrhythmogenesis. Protection afforded by beta 2-blocking agents may be due to alleviation of HK in HK rats or to induction of hyperkalaemia in NK rats.", 
    "44": "This report describes a new in vitro method for measuring the diffusional permeability of an endothelial monolayer and its use in investigating the modulation of permeability by various agents, e.g., isoproterenol, propranolol, dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), and cytochalasin D. To determine permeability, tracers of different molecular weights were applied simultaneously on a chromatography column containing confluent endothelial cells cultured on porous microcarrier beads. The Sangren-Sheppard model was used to determine the permeability of the endothelial monolayer from the tracer elution profiles. For six radiolabeled tracers the mean (+/- SD) permeabilities (cm/s x 10(-5)) in order of increasing tracer molecular weight were [3H]water, 82.0 +/- 28.8; [14C]urea, 49.5 +/- 9.5; [14C]mannitol, 13.3 +/- 4.7; [14C]-sucrose, 14.1 +/- 2.5; [3H]polyethylene glycol (900 mol wt), 4.80 +/- 1.61; and [3H]polyethylene glycol (4,000 mol wt), 1.97 +/- 1.01. These permeabilities deviate less from in vivo values than those obtained in other in vitro systems and are 10 times higher than in vivo estimates. The values were reproducible for up to the 4 h tested. Modulation of endothelial monolayer permeability was studied in a separate series of experiments. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10(-6) M) decreased the permeability to mannitol by 36% and to polyethylene glycol (900 mol wt) by 49%; in both instances the decrease in permeability was reversed by propranolol. Propranolol alone had no effect. Dibutyryl cAMP (10(-3) M) decreased the permeability to mannitol by 40% and to polyethylene glycol by 47%; permeability returned to base line when dibutyryl cAMP was removed. Cytochalasin D (1 microgram/ml) increased permeability by 350% for mannitol and 380% for polyethylene glycol; the permeability change was reversed after removal of cytochalasin D. The results indicate that cell-column chromatography is a powerful method that can be used to characterize the permeability of endothelial monolayers and to investigate permeability changes produced by various agents.", 
    "45": "We examined the clinical efficacy and safety of intravenous nadolol acutely, as well as chronic nadolol alone or combined with a type IA antiarrhythmic drug in 19 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and heart disease, mean age 62 +/- 15 years, and mean left ventricular ejection fraction 39 +/- 8%. Patients underwent electrophysiological studies in the drug-free state (control), after intravenous nadolol (dose = 0.05 mg/kg), and oral nadolol (dose = 80 mg/day) for 5 days alone or in combination with a type IA antiarrhythmic drug. Electrocardiographic and electrophysiological effects as well as ventricular tachycardia induction at electrophysiological study were analyzed. Long-term therapy with oral nadolol alone or in combination with a type IA antiarrhythmic drug was evaluated in responders. Intravenous nadolol prolonged RR and QRS intervals but had no effect on PR and QTc intervals. Oral nadolol alone tended to prolong RR intervals (P = 0.08). Oral nadolol with type IA antiarrhythmic drug prolonged RR and QTc intervals (P less than 0.001). The mean right ventricular effective refractory period tended to prolong after intravenous nadolol alone (from 251 +/- 29 to 263 +/- 25 msec, P = 0.08). Oral nadolol and type IA antiarrhythmic drugs did not prolong right ventricular effective refractory period (P = 0.3). Eighteen patients had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia at control electrophysiological study. After intravenous nadolol, ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible in seven patients. Ventricular tachycardia did not recur and remained noninducible in two of six patients who tolerated oral nadolol alone. Mean right ventricular effective refractory period prolonged from baseline values (from 249 +/- 30 to 271 +/- 30 msec, P less than 0.02) in patients who became noninducible on intravenous nadolol. In patients who remained inducible, mean right ventricular effective refractory period remained unchanged (from 253 +/- 29 to 258 +/- 22 msec, P greater than 0.2). In nonresponders to intravenous or oral nadolol, oral nadolol, and type IA antiarrhythmic drug suppressed ventricular tachycardia induction in two of ten patients. During follow-up, three patients continued on oral nadolol alone (one patient) or oral nadolol and type IA antiarrhythmic drug (two patients). Adverse effects resulting in nadolol discontinuation occurred in five patients. Therefore, we concluded that intravenous nadolol is effective in acute suppression of inducible ventricular tachycardia in selected patients. Oral nadolol alone or in combination with type IA antiarrhythmic drug is infrequently effective and poorly tolerated by this patient population. In addition, electrophysiological studies on intravenous nadolol do not predict the outcome of oral nadolol therapy.", 
    "46": "To test whether summation and inhibition of excitation by ultrarapid train pulses were modified by frequency and duration of trains, using lidocaine and beta blockade, the strength-interval relationship was determined with a single extrastimulus and train pulses (100 and 200 Hz) in 28 anesthetized, open-chest dogs. The effective refractory period (ERP) determined at greater than or equal to 5 mA was shorter for trains than for single stimulus (summation). Summation determined at 15 mA increased progressively as the duration of trains was increased to 50 msec after which it reached a plateau. ERP determined at less than or equal to 2 mA was longer with train pulses than with single stimulus (inhibition). Inhibition for 200 Hz trains increased linearly with train duration up to 200 msec, while for 100 Hz trains it became constant when the duration was greater than or equal to 80 msec. Lidocaine (plasma concentration: 2.6 +/- 1.0 micrograms/mL) did not affect inhibition and summation in 11 dogs. Propranolol (1 mg/kg, iv) increased summation at 15 mA (n = 7, 30 +/- 10 vs 46 +/- 11 msec with 100 Hz trains, P less than 0.01), but did not affect inhibition (37 +/- 26 vs 29 +/- 17 msec, NS). In conclusion, (1) effect of frequency of train pulses was more on inhibition than on summation; (2) lidocaine did not affect inhibition and summation; and (3) propranolol increased summation but not inhibition.", 
    "47": "The authors analyse data of 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in whom the bronchial obstruction made such a severe progress during beta-blocker therapy necessary to admit them to the hospital. Most of them were middle-aged patients with chronic bronchitis, only 8 suffered from bronchial asthma. Because of cardial disorders, usually beta-blockers were given for several days (1/3-rd of the patients received Betaloc, a cardioselective drug), besides 2/3-rd of them received bronchodilator therapy, too. In spite of this, all patients needed hospitalize because of dyspnoea, obstruction, and hypoxaemia in 1/3-rd. Although deterioration of their condition has resulted, beta-blocker wasn't discontinued by the medical attendant, notwithstanding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was known previously in 33 patients.", 
    "48": "139 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been followed up for 1-28 years (mean 8.9 years). Group 1 consisted of 60 patients (mean age 38 years) without indication for septal myectomy (SM) (no pressure gradient at rest in 8, pressure gradient less than 50 mm Hg in 52 cases); group 2 consisted of 79 patients (mean age 36 years) who had SM (pressure gradient at rest 70 mm Hg). Management in group 1 was the following: (1a) propranolol (n = 20) (160 mg/d), (1b) verapamil (n = 18) (360 mg/d) and (1c) no therapy (n = 22). 19 patients died in group 1 (mortality 3.6% year); 17 died in group 2 (mortality 2.4%/year). 10 year survival in group 1b was 80% and in groups 1a und 1c 67% and 65% respectively. Patients of group 1b had a higher survival rate (p less than 0.05) than the other subgroups. Surgery patients treated with verapamil (120-360 mg/d) (n = 17) had a 10-year survival rate of 100% compared to 78% for surgery patients (n = 34) without such treatment (p less than 0.05). In summary, it can be said that the overall survival rate after SM is better than that with medical treatment. Under verapamil, however, survival is not different from that after surgery. The most favorable outcome was observed in surgery patients under long-term therapy with verapamil, probably due to the reduction of systolic pressure overload (SM) and improvement in diastolic function (verapamil).", 
    "49": "Among the various treatments of ruptured oesophageal varices two seem to be effective: oral propranolol therapy and ligation of the oesophagus on clip. In this controlled study these two methods were compared in a series of 55 patients hospitalized for ruptured oesophageal varices. After haemodynamic stability was obtained, the patients were allocated at random to either propranolol therapy (n = 28) or surgery (n = 27). Twenty-one per cent of these patients belonged to group C of Child's classification and 54 per cent to group A. The parameters studied were similar in both groups. Five patients were excluded from the study: 2 in the medical group when it appeared that propranolol was contra-indicated and 3 in the surgical group who died before the operation; however, these 5 patients were taken into account in a second statistical evaluation. Nineteen out the 26 patients under propranolol (73 per cent) had rebleeding (within the first 10 days in 3 cases). In the surgical group recurrent bleeding was observed in 4 out of the 24 patients (17 per cent), and 4 other patients died post-operatively. The difference in favour of the surgical group was highly significant (P less than 0.001), and it remained significant (P less than 0.05) when the 5 patients who could not be treated were included into the calculations. Cox's multivariate analysis showed that patients in Child's C group had a poorer prognosis.", 
    "50": "In order to test the physiological significance of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in pharmacomechanical coupling, we have utilized two near-physiological systems, in which relatively high molecular weight solutes can be applied intracellularly and receptor coupling is retained: beta-escin permeabilization and reversible permeabilization. We showed that in smooth muscle permeabilized with beta-escin, one of the saponin esters, alpha 1-adrenergic (phenylephrine) and muscarinic (carbachol) agonists, as well as caffeine and InsP3, cause contractions mediated by Ca2+ release. These contractions were calmodulin-dependent and blocked by depletion of Ca2+ stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Intracellular heparin (Mr = about 5000), a blocker of InsP3 binding to its receptor and a specific inhibitor of InsP3-induced Ca2+ release in smooth muscles, inhibited the responses to the agonists and to InsP3, but not those to caffeine, nor did it block the enhanced contractile response to cytoplasmic Ca2+ induced by agonists and by GTP gamma S. Neomycin blocked Ca2+ release induced by carbachol, but not by caffeine. In reversibly permeabilized ileum smooth muscle cells, loaded with Fura-2 acid and heparin, the intracellular heparin inhibited Ca2+ release and contractions induced by carbachol in Ca2+-free, high K+ solution. Heparin did not inhibit the high K+ contractions (with 1.2 mM Ca2+) and had no significant inhibitory effects on carbachol-induced responses in the presence of extracellular Ca2+. These results, obtained under near-physiological conditions, support the conclusion that InsP3 is the major physiological messenger of the Ca2+ release component of pharmacomechanical coupling, but not of the components mediated by Ca2+ influx or by potentiation of the contractile response to Ca2+.", 
    "51": "Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (1-3000 micrograms/kg) produced dose-dependent pupil dilatation in conscious C57/Bl/6 mice with an ED50 of 54 micrograms/kg (95% confidence limits 40-74 micrograms/kg). This response was rapid in onset and of approximately 30 min duration. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists idazoxan (1 or 3 mg/kg i.p.) and yohimbine (1 or 3 mg/kg i.p.) both produced dose-related miosis, but the alpha 1- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists prazosin (1 or 3 mg/kg i.p.) and pindolol (1 or 3 mg/kg i.p.) were without effect. These doses of idazoxan and yohimbine potently reversed the mydriasis induced by clonidine (100 micrograms/kg i.p.), while prazosin and pindolol were again ineffective. Clonidine-induced mydriasis was also unaltered by the 5-HT antagonists, methysergide (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) and ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) or 0.1 mg/kg i.p. of the dopamine antagonists, haloperidol, SCH 23390 and BRL 34778. A dose of 0.25 microgram clonidine, which was ineffective when administered i.p., produced marked mydriasis after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection. In addition, the mydriasis produced by i.p. injection of clonidine (100 micrograms/kg) was abolished by i.c.v. dosing of 2.5 micrograms idazoxan or yohimbine, but again not by prazosin or pindolol. Together, these data provide strong evidence to indicate that clonidine-induced mydriasis is exclusively mediated via central alpha 2-adrenoceptors and that this response provides a useful model for studying the function of these receptors.", 
    "52": "The distribution of the specific binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in sucrose gradients containing homogenates of rat cerebral cortex centrifuged to equilibrium was examined after acute treatment with phenelzine (50 mg/kg i.p.). There was a time-dependent decrease in the number of beta-adrenoceptors in the plasma membrane fractions (0.8-1.0 M sucrose), without any significant alteration in the light density fractions (0.4-0.5 M sucrose). These results suggest that agonist-induced beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation is promoted by a process other than receptor internalization.", 
    "53": "The effects of the serotonin agonist MK-212, on rat plasma ACTH were examined. MK-212 significantly increased plasma ACTH levels, and this effect was blocked by the 5-HT1C antagonists mesulergine and metergoline but not by spiperone, ketanserin, or (-)-pindolol. The results suggest that MK-212 activates the 5-HT1C receptor subtype to increase ACTH.", 
    "54": "We have used a modified noninvasive echo-Doppler cardiac output device, based on the principle of attenuated compensation volume flow, to assess the cardiovascular effects of the slow-calcium antagonist nicardipine in coronary disease. The dose-response effects of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg intravenous nicardipine were determined in 8 patients with angina. Dose-related decreases were seen in systemic mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.01) after administration of nicardipine. Cardiac pumping indexes were improved, as evident from linear increases in cardiac stroke volume (p less than 0.001), stroke length (p less than 0.01) and time-averaged mean velocity (p less than 0.01). The echo-Doppler device was also used to assess beta-blocking/nicardipine combination therapy in patients with angina. When nicardipine was given after the cardioselective beta blocker atenolol the reduction in heart rate and cardiac output after atenolol was reversed compared with a group that received atenolol followed by placebo. Cardiac performance improved and the 35% reduction in systemic vascular resistance was associated with markedly increased cardiac index (p less than 0.01), augmentation of time-averaged mean velocity (p less than 0.01) and cardiac stroke length (p less than 0.05). These data are consistent with previous invasive studies of nicardipine, either alone or when combined with beta blockade in coronary disease. The data also suggest that nicardipine/beta-blocking combination is safe in patients with coronary heart disease and that the echo-Doppler method of cardiovascular monitoring will prove useful in human pharmacodynamic studies.", 
    "55": "Nicardipine was administered orally for up to 1 year to 250 patients with essential hypertension. Phase I, a 2- to 4-week placebo washout to establish baseline supine diastolic blood pressure (BP), was followed by 4 weeks of open-label nicardipine dose titration (phase II) to establish optimal dosage on a 3-times-daily regimen for each patient. After nicardipine administration, approximately 79% of the patients had supine diastolic BP less than 90 mm Hg or greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg below baseline. The reduction in systolic and diastolic BPs was somewhat greater in patients older than 60 years. After phase III--an 8-week double-blind comparison of dosage regimens of 2- and 3-times-daily--all patients returned to a 3-times-daily regimen at their optimal daily dosage for 40 weeks of open treatment (phase IV). Supplemental treatment with a diuretic or a beta blocker was required by 67 patients. By the end of phase IV, more than 100 patients had completed 1 year of nicardipine monotherapy (mean supine diastolic BP = 85 mm Hg, approximately 14 mm Hg below baseline). Finally, patients were randomly assigned to continue nicardipine on a double-blind basis or take a matching placebo for 6 weeks (phase V, n = 101). The nicardipine group had only a slight change in supine diastolic BP, whereas those receiving placebo had statistically significant increases in supine diastolic BP toward baseline values. Adverse experiences, attributed to the vasodilatory effects of nicardipine, tended to occur in the first few months of the study and resulted in early withdrawal of 30 patients. Overall, these results show that nicardipine is a well-tolerated antihypertensive agent with efficacy sustained during 1 year of treatment.", 
    "56": "beta-Adrenoceptor density and ligand affinity, basal adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP synthesis upon stimulation with forskolin, fluoride, guanine nucleotides (GTP or guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GppNHp) or isoproterenol in the presence of the nucleotides were studied in membranes prepared from lungs of young (aged 2-3 months) and of old (aged 24-25 months) male Wistar rats. There was a significant (P less than 0.05, 21%) increase in beta-receptor density and a significant (P less than 0.05, 38%) decrease in the percentage of high-affinity binding sites for isoproterenol. Both basal adenylate cyclase activity and that after stimulation with guanine nucleotides or isoproterenol in the presence of nucleotides were unaltered with age. Forskolin stimulation of cAMP synthesis was significantly reduced (by 24%, P less than 0.05) in tissues from older animals. It is suggested that the age-dependent changes in properties of beta-receptors in rat lungs are compensatory, in order to ensure equal cAMP production for equal agonist stimulation.", 
    "57": "Extended (72-hour) ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was used to enable time series analysis of heart rate and asymptomatic ST-segment depression in 9 patients with severe coronary artery disease. The effects of beta 1-adrenergic blockade with optimal dose metoprolol were then assessed. Data were analyzed using Fourier transformation, autocorrelation and cross-correlation to examine possible coupling between heart rate and ischemic electrocardiographic changes. A marked circadian pattern was observed for both heart rate and ambulatory myocardial ischemia, with a period of approximately 24 hours by both Fourier and autocorrelation methods. Cross-correlation revealed heart rate and ischemia to be tightly coupled with a lag of 0 hours during placebo. During beta 1 adrenergic blockade the marked circadian variation in heart rate was diminished, although some periodicity in the 24-hour region remained. Ambulatory ischemia was also markedly diminished during beta 1-adrenergic blockade; however, some residual ischemia remained that was characterized by a peak spectral activity shifted to a period of 5 to 7 hours. Heart rate and ischemia were not coupled during beta 1-adrenergic blockade, as evidenced by lack of significant cross-correlation. Thus, time series analysis suggests close coupling between the variation in heart rate and ambulatory ischemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease. Beta 1-adrenergic blockade can markedly alter the periodic characteristics of and coupling between heart rate and ischemia. Ischemia remaining during beta 1-adrenergic blockade may have different spectral characteristics than that predominating during placebo administration. These differences may be manifestations of the heterogenous pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for ambulatory ischemia and may have therapeutic implications.", 
    "58": "The status of beta-adrenergic receptors was investigated in A431 cells exposed to chronic stimulation by the beta-adrenergic agonist, (-)-isoproterenol. Specific binding of beta-adrenergic antagonist (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol declined to 60-80% below control values within 12 h of agonist treatment. This decline in ligand binding was also observed in high-speed membrane fractions prepared from agonist-treated cells. Immunoblots probed with anti-receptor antibodies revealed both that beta-adrenergic receptors from untreated and treated cells migrated as 65,000-Mr peptides and that the cellular complement of receptor was unchanged. Indirect immunofluorescence localization of beta-adrenergic receptors was comparable in control (untreated) cells and cells challenged with (-)-isoproterenol for 1, 12, or 24 h. Thus receptor complement, migration on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and localization in situ are largely unaffected by agonist stimulation. Receptor binding of antagonist radioligands, in contrast, is markedly down-regulated in cells stimulated chronically with beta-adrenergic agonists. These data argue in favour of agonist-induced alteration(s) in the conformation of the receptor that preclude radioligand binding rather than agonist-induced receptor sequestration and/or degradation.", 
    "59": "Polyclonal antibodies directed against (i) rodent lung beta 2-adrenergic receptor, (ii) a synthetic fragment of an extracellular domain of the receptor, and (iii) human placenta G-protein beta-subunits, were used to localize these antigens in situ in intact and permeabilized human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Antibodies directed against beta 2-adrenergic receptors showed a punctate immunofluorescence staining throughout the cell surface of fixed intact cells. Punctate staining was also observed in clones of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with an expression vector harbouring the gene for the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor. The immunofluorescence observed with anti-receptor antibodies paralleled the level of receptor expression. In contrast, the beta-subunits common to G-proteins were not stained in fixed intact cells, presumably reflecting their intracellular localization. In detergent-permeabilized fixed cells, strong punctate staining of G beta-subunits was observed throughout the cytoplasm. This is the first indirect immunofluorescence localization of beta-adrenergic receptors and G-proteins. Punctate immunofluorescence staining suggests that both antigens are distributed in clusters.", 
    "60": "Slices of rat kidney cortex were incubated in [3H]noradrenaline, then placed in a flow cell and subjected to electrical field stimulation. At a stimulation frequency of 5 Hz, both the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (0.1 microM) and the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.1 microM) significantly enhanced the stimulation-induced (S-I) outflow of radioactivity from the slice. However, neither clonidine (0.1 microM) nor methoxamine (10 microM), alpha 2- and alpha 1-agonists respectively, affected the S-I outflow of radioactivity at this stimulation frequency. At a lower stimulation frequency (1 Hz), the S-I outflow of radioactivity was not affected by idazoxan or prazosin, but was inhibited by both clonidine and methoxamine. The effect of clonidine was prevented by idazoxan (0.1 microM), but not by prazosin (0.1 microM). The effect of methoxamine was abolished by prazosin (0.1 microM), but not by idazoxan (0.1 microM). The inhibitory effect of methoxamine was not prevented by the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM) or the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline (1 microM) and thus was not mediated by either prostaglandins or adenosine. The results suggest that both prejunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors are directly involved in modulation of noradrenaline release from the renal sympathetic nerves of the rat.", 
    "61": "We investigated interactions between noradrenaline and thyroid hormone status in the regulation of (Na+,K+)-ATPase in vivo. Treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine did not prevent the increases in heart (Na+,K+)-ATPase associated with triiodothyronine treatment. Administration of methimazole did not prevent the increase in (Na+,K+)-ATPase indices in cerebral cortex and heart associated with subacute noradrenergic stimulation by yohimbine. There was no evidence for synergistic effects between thyroid hormone administration and noradrenergic stimulation by yohimbine. Thyroid hormone, unlike noradrenaline, mainly increased (Na+,K+)-ATPase activity with low affinity for ouabain. These results show that noradrenaline and thyroid hormone regulate (Na+,K+)-ATPase by largely independent mechanisms, and may regulate different populations of enzyme molecules.", 
    "62": "The family of G-protein-linked receptors includes many important pharmacological targets, of which the beta-adrenergic receptor is one of the best characterized. A better understanding of those factors that determine whether a ligand functions as an antagonist or as an agonist would facilitate the development of pharmaceutical agents that act at these receptors. Site-directed mutagenesis of the hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor has implicated the conserved Asp113 residue in the third hydrophobic domain of the receptor in the interaction with cationic amine agonists and antagonists (Strader, C. D., Sigal, I. S., Candelore, M. R., Rands, E., Hill, W. S., and Dixon, R. A. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem, 263, 10267-10271). We now report that substitution of Asp113 with a glutamic acid residue results in a mutant beta-adrenergic receptor which recognizes several known beta-adrenergic antagonists as partial agonists. This partial agonist activity requires the presence of a carboxylate side chain on the amino acid residue at position 113 and is not observed when an asparagine residue is substituted at this position. These observations support the existence of overlapping binding sites for agonists and antagonists on the beta-adrenergic receptor and demonstrate that genetic engineering of receptors can complement structure-activity studies of ligands in defining the molecular interactions involved in receptor activation.", 
    "63": "Murrayaquinone-A, a carbazole alkaloid, was found to produce a triphasic inotropic response (first positive, second negative and third positive phases) of guinea-pig papillary muscle that normally paced at a slow rate of 0.2 Hz in Krebs-Henseleit solution at 30 degrees C. Murrayaquinone-A produced a concentration-dependent (10(-6) M-10(-4) M) positive inotropic effect (pD2 value 5.27 evaluated at the first phase). The triphasic pattern of inotropism of murrayaquinone-A was unaffected by reserpine, metoprolol or cimetidine treatment. Murrayaquinone-A increased the initial upstroke and the duration of the slow action potential in partially depolarized muscle (external K+ = 30 mEq). Murrayaquinone-A did not cause any positive inotropy under anoxic conditions and in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol and dicumarol. These results indicated that the triphasic inotropic effect of murrayaquinone-A is not mediated through a receptor mechanism but through a novel mechanism involving mitochondrial ATP production, thereby increasing the slow inward calcium current across the cardiac cell membrane via cyclic AMP converted from mitochondrial ATP.", 
    "64": "Electrophysiological findings support the existence of voltage-dependent, sodium channel-associated receptors for class I antiarrhythmics. We have tried to identify such receptors with tritiated lidocaine. High-affinity binding sites were discovered in heart and brain membranes, but liver and kidney particulate fractions had the highest density of sites. The dissociation constants were 75 nM in bovine heart and 29 nM in guinea-pig liver membranes. Binding was reversible (t 1/2: 102 s at 2 degrees C), optimal at pH 9-10 and was only partly destroyed by heat treatment. Subcellular fractionation experiments excluded a plasmalemmal association of the lidocaine site in heart. The competition profile of 16 antiarrhythmics indicated chemical comparability of the sites in heart and liver. These data greatly challenge the applicability of labeled lidocaine as sodium channel probe. The pharmacological significance of the site described here remains to be clarified.", 
    "65": "We investigated the effects of beta-agonist and antagonist (isoproterenol, propranolol) on the pulmonary circulation and on the pulmonary pressor response to 5-HT in an isolated canine lung lobe. The pulmonary vessels were dilated by isoproterenol at doses up to 200 micrograms, but were constricted by alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation at relatively high doses. The mechanism by which isoproterenol inhibited the 5-HT response is probably related to the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors at the lower doses and to the stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors at the higher doses. Propranolol alone had no effect on pulmonary vascular tone, but inhibited the 5-HT response markedly at doses high, possibly by directly blocking the 5-HT receptors.", 
    "66": "A potential physiological role for cardiac histamine and its interaction with norepinephrine were investigated in isolated left ventricles from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Prior to drug administration, left ventricle-to-body weight ratios and spontaneous firing rates (beats per min) were significantly increased in SHR ventricles vs. age- and sex-matched controls (WKY). Also, action potential duration was significantly prolonged in SHR at all levels of repolarization. In all hearts, norepinephrine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) increased spontaneous rate and the percent incidence of arrhythmias. The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine (10(-5) M) potentiated the rate and arrhythmogenic effects of norepinephrine in SHR and, to a lesser extent, in WKY preparations; propranolol (10(-6) M) reduced them. Histamine (10(-7) M) also inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in arrhythmias in SHR, but not in WKY. The attenuation of adrenergically induced rhythm disturbances by histamine and their potentiation by cimetidine in hypertensive hearts support the hypothesis that histamine plays a role as a postjunctional modulator of adrenoceptor function in a setting of hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy.", 
    "67": "We studied [3H]serotonin [( 3H]5-HT) binding on cultured arterial smooth muscle cells from rat aorta. We found a high and low affinity binding site. Binding to the higher affinity site could be displaced by drugs in an order corresponding most closely with the 5-HT1B subtype, and high affinity [125I]iodo-cyanopindolol binding was also found. We found evidence for a 5-HT2 subtype using [3H]ketanserin binding, with similar results whether specific binding was determined using unlabelled ketanserin, methysergide or mianserin.", 
    "68": "Both Shy-Drager syndrome and pheochromocytoma are characterized by an abnormal catecholamine secretion, e.g. a reduced secretion in Shy-Drager syndrome, and an excessive stimulation in pheochromocytoma resulting in adrenergic dysfunction and in adrenergic hyperactivity, respectively. The relationship between extreme variations in circulating catecholamines and beta-adrenergic receptor activity was studied in two patients with severe orthostatic hypotension (Shy-Drager syndrome) and in a patient with pheochromocytoma with excessive spontaneous catecholamine increases using the lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor assay. In both patients with Shy-Drager syndrome, basal plasma concentrations of epinephrine and dopamine were low under resting conditions and could not be stimulated in the upright position. Norepinephrine was low in the first patient, and could not be stimulated; whereas the second patient had a normal basal concentration of norepinephrine, which could be moderately stimulated. There was no beta-adrenoceptor abnormality in the first patient: however, in the second patient, there were no measurable beta-adrenoceptors on membrane fractions, whereas a population of receptors only in the low affinity state could be identified on intact cells. Alpha-adrenoceptor density on thrombocyte membranes was slightly increased in both patients with Shy-Drager syndrome and showed no substantial change during upright posture. Catecholamine increases in the pheochromocytoma patient were accompanied by a rise in blood pressure, bradycardia, and an acute up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Plasma concentrations of cAMP paralleled the increase in receptor density and blood pressure. The findings in pheochromocytoma add support to the theory that an acute catecholamine stimulation gives rise to an acute beta-adrenergic sensitization leading to blood pressure elevation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Eight patients with chronic open-angle glaucoma who had an intraocular pressure greater than 24 mm Hg at some time during the day while taking timolol 0.5% twice daily were given the fixed ratio combination of timolol 0.5% with pilocarpine 2% (TP2) twice daily. By comparing full 24-hour diurnal curves on timolol with those on TP2 it was possible to show that all patients except one (at a single timepoint) had an IOP less than 22 mm Hg when changed to TP2. The mean IOPs, the area under the diurnal pressure curve, and the diurnal variation were all significantly lower on TP2 twice daily than on timolol 0.5% twice daily.", 
    "70": "The pressor and catecholamine responses to laryngoscopy and intubation were studied in nine patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and in eight normotensive controls. Five of the PIH patients had received oral labetalol as antihypertensive therapy. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased significantly from the pre-induction value in all groups 1 min after intubation, and also at 3 min in those with PIH who had not received labetalol. Arterial pressure was significantly greater in both PIH groups than in the control group at all times. However, the percentage increase in MAP on intubation was significantly less in the labetalol treated group than in either the untreated or the control groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in plasma concentrations of either noradrenaline or adrenaline; noradrenaline concentration increased significantly after intubation only in the control group. Labetalol appears to confer some protection against the pressor response to intubation in parturients with PIH.", 
    "71": "Norepinephrine stimulates the growth in size of non-dividing, neonatal cardiac muscle cells, and it can stimulate the growth in numbers of dividing hepatocytes and endothelial cells in culture. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that in dividing fetal cardiocytes, norepinephrine would stimulate growth in cell number rather than in cell size. Fourteen-day fetal heart cells were placed in serum-free or serum-supplemented cultures in the presence or absence of norepinephrine (NE), NE plus propranolol, or isoproterenol for 4 days. Almost 90% of the cardiocytes in serum-supplemented medium were in the cell cycle as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody staining during this period. In addition, between days 2 and 4 of culture, 35% and 40% of these cardiocytes were labeled with 3H-thymidine. After 4 days the cardiocytes increased in cell number in the serum-supplemented NE cultures as compared to serum-free cultures. In contrast, there was no significant change in cardiocyte volume between any of the groups examined. It was concluded that in dividing muscle cell populations the effect of norepinephrine was to enhance cell proliferation rather than to stimulate cell growth in size.", 
    "72": "The effects of intravenous administration of adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists on relative cerebral blood flow, cerebral perfusion pressure, intracranial pressure, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were assessed in rats under urethane anesthesia. Administration of phenylephrine (a preferential alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist), adrenaline (a mixed alpha/beta-adrenoceptor agonist), noradrenaline (a mixed alpha/beta-adrenoceptor agonist) raised mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure, but lowered heart rate. On the other hand, administration of isoproterenol (a beta-adrenoceptor agonist), phentolamine (an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist) or propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist) lowered mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure or cerebral blood flow. In addition, phentolamine raised both intracranial pressure and heart rate, whereas propranolol lowered both intracranial pressure and heart rate. However, isoproterenol produced a decrease in heart rate, without affecting intracranial pressure. There was no significant difference between the groups of animals for PCO2, PO2 or pH throughout the studies. The results suggest that adrenoceptor agonists or antagonists act through breakthrough of autoregulation, with acute hypertension or hypotension, to enhance or to reduce cerebral blood flow in rats.", 
    "73": "Headaches, vomiting, and altered sensorium can be seen in patients with shunt malfunction as well as in those with migraines. We report five cases in which children with hydrocephalus and CSF shunts presented with a variety of recurring symptoms, including headache, vomiting, impairment of consciousness to the point of coma, and, in one patient, decerebrate posturing. Various diagnoses were entertained: shunt malfunction, slit ventricle syndrome, and low pressure (overshunting). Repeated procedures were carried out in all patients, including shunt taps, multiple shunt revisions, and a subtemporal decompression. When the diagnosis of migraine was considered, four patients improved on propranolol therapy; one failed this therapy but responded to verapamil. We conclude that in patients with hydrocephalus and repeated bouts of symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, and impairment of consciousness and in the case of documented, adequate shunt function, the diagnosis of migraine be entertained before further operative intervention is undertaken.", 
    "74": "Despite the numerous reports documenting the safety and efficacy of the use of propranolol, a selective beta-adrenergic blocker, as the sole agent for preoperative preparation of a hyperthyroid patient, many surgeons continue to add a solution containing iodine to the treatment regimen. The rationale for the concomitant use of iodine solution and propranolol is that the iodine solution reduces the amount of propranolol required to make the patient symptomatically euthyroid and that iodine administration reduces the vascularity of the gland, thereby minimizing intraoperative blood loss. To ascertain the validity of these beliefs, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 42 consecutive hyperthyroid patients who underwent subtotal thyroidectomy. These patients either received propranolol alone (20 patients) or propranolol with iodine solution (22 patients) for preoperative preparation. Comparison of the medication doses, estimated blood loss, and postoperative changes in hemoglobin and hemocrit using the Student's t-test, failed to demonstrate any significant difference between the two treatment protocols (P greater than 0.1). We conclude that the addition of iodine to propranolol for preoperative preparation of hyperthyroid patients does not result in any significant advantage over the use of propranolol alone.", 
    "75": "Propranolol, like many drugs, is used clinically as a racemic mixture. The major pharmacodynamic effects of propranolol, however, are mediated by the (-)-isomer, which is 100 times as potent as the (+)-isomer. The two isomers also differ in their pharmacokinetic characteristics. To determine whether halothane anesthesia stereo-selectively inhibits the metabolism of racemic propranolol, eight male mongrel dogs were studied. On the first day of the study, 40 mg racemic propranolol was infused into the portal vein and arterial blood samples were obtained over the following 4 h for the measurements of (+)- and (-)-propranolol concentrations by HPLC. The study was repeated 24 h later during 2 MAC halothane anesthesia, when the intrinsic clearance of total propranolol was decreased by 67.5 +/- 5%, from 6.14 +/- 1.1 1/min to 1.84 +/- 0.4 1/min (P less than 0.05). The decrease in intrinsic clearance was stereoselective, (-)-propranolol being affected to a greater extent than (+)-propranolol; thus, the decrease in the clearance of (-)-propranolol, from 10.96 +/- 2.71/min to 2.6 +/- 0.71/min (73 +/- 5%) was significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than the decrease in the clearance of (+)-propranolol, (62 +/- 3%) from 4.3 +/- 0.8 1/min to 1.5 +/- 0.3 1/min. Furthermore, the ratio of the intrinsic clearance of (-)-propranolol to the intrinsic clearance of (+)-propranolol was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced by halothane anesthesia, from 2.42 +/- 0.29 to 1.69 +/- 0.11. Stereoselective inhibition of propranolol metabolism results in proportionally higher concentrations of (-)-propranolol during halothane anesthesia than are present in awake dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "Previous studies determined that direct activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with phorbol esters increases the number of angiotensin II (ANG II)-specific binding sites in neuronal cultures prepared from the hypothalamus and brain stem of 1-day-old rats. In the physiological situation, PKC is activated by diacylglycerol, which can be produced by multiple pathways, such as stimulation of inositol phospholipid (IP) hydrolysis, phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, or by de novo synthesis. In the present study we have examined whether stimulation of IP hydrolysis, and presumably activation of PKC, can mimic the actions of phorbol esters on ANG II-specific binding. We have incubated neuronal cultures with agents that increase IP hydrolysis and have determined the effects on ANG II-specific binding. Incubation of neuronal cultures with norepinephrine (NE) at concentrations (greater than 5 microM) and for times (15-60 min) that cause large increases in IP hydrolysis caused increases in the number of ANG II-specific binding sites, mimicking the actions of phorbol esters. The return of IP hydrolysis to control values was associated with a return of ANG II-specific binding to control levels. The upregulatory action of NE was abolished by prazosin, demonstrating the involvement of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. In addition, this effect was blunted by the PKC antagonist H 7, suggesting PKC involvement in the response. Thus we have determined a potential physiological mechanism by which stimulation of IP hydrolysis by NE, and possible subsequent activation of PKC, leads to upregulation of ANG II-specific binding sites in neuronal cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "To establish the contribution of combination therapy in stable angina, the short- and long-term effects of diltiazem (120 mg and 360 mg/day, respectively), and the additive effects of sublingual isosorbide dinitrate, 10 mg, and atenolol, 100 mg, were studied in 11 patients with chronic stable angina using an open-label sequential design. All patients underwent exercise testing without therapy, and with each drug and their combinations. Exercise time and heart rate-blood pressure product were measured at 1-mm ST-segment depression, or at peak exercise if the test result was negative. Exercise time increased from a control value of 8.0 +/- 2.3 minutes (mean +/- standard deviation) to 11.4 +/- 2.4 minutes (p less than 0.0001) after the administration of isosorbide dinitrate, to 11.3 +/- 1.8 minutes (p less than 0.001) after short-term diltiazem and to 12.4 +/- 1.5 minutes (p less than 0.001) after long-term diltiazem. The rate-pressure product increased from a control value of 19,070 +/- 3,564 to 24,431 +/- 4,795 beats/min X mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) after isosorbide dinitrate, to 22,287 +/- 4,753 beats/min X mm Hg (p less than 0.01) after short-term diltiazem and to 21,812 +/- 3,976 beats/min X mm Hg (p less than 0.007) after long-term diltiazem. The addition of atenolol to long-term diltiazem significantly reduced the rate-pressure product compared with long-term diltiazem alone (21,812 +/- 3,976 vs 13,926 +/- 2,880 beats/min X mm Hg, (p less than 0.002), although there was no further significant increase in exercise time (12.4 +/- 1.5 vs 13.3 +/- 1.6 minutes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Following transrectal administration, 123I iodoamphetamine (IMP) has been shown in both animal and patient studies to be capable of detecting the presence of portasystemic shunting (PSS). However, the ability of this method to actually quantitate PSS in the presence of cirrhosis and propranolol has not been demonstrated. We studied nine dogs with hitologically proven cirrhosis induced by chronic bile duct ligation. After intravenous injection of propranolol, PSS were measured with both the IMP method and the standard of portal vein infusion of 99mTc macroaggregated albumin (MAA) given through a mesenteric vein catheter. Based on linear regression, a close relationship was seen, given by the equation: MAA = IMP 0.9 + 0.035, with correlation coefficient of 0.99. Thus, in dogs with cirrhosis secondary to chronic bile duct ligation and after propranolol administration, PSS can be quantitated with the transrectal IMP method.", 
    "79": "Sodium nitroprusside is commonly used for the induction of hypotension during neurosurgical procedures. Its toxicity stems from hemodynamic compromise as well as from its metabolites, especially the formation of cyanide. A patient is described who underwent craniotomy for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. He gradually recovered following the operation, but needed continued administration of sodium nitroprusside for control of hypertension. On the 7th postoperative day, he deteriorated into coma with evidence of severe edema and herniation on the computerized tomography scan. Cessation of sodium nitroprusside and treatment for cyanide poisoning resulted in resolution of his symptoms within hours. The potential toxicity of sodium nitroprusside, measures to prevent toxicity, and therapeutic steps are discussed.", 
    "80": "The effects of combined alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blockade and of beta-receptor/slow channel calcium blockade on systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and on adrenergic activity were compared in 2 matched groups of men suffering from ischemic heart disease. They were studied at rest supine and during ischemia-inducing exercise in the seated posture using invasive percutaneous techniques. Fourteen patients received 200 mg labetalol as a single oral dosis, 15 metoprolol (100 mg) plus nifedipine (10 mg). Both regimens reduced pressures in the systemic and pulmonary circulation under all conditions. At rest, stroke volume and cardiac output slightly decreased after labetalol and increased after metoprolol/nifedipine. During exercise the changes induced by the two regimens were virtually identical: heart rates and vascular resistances were reduced, stroke volume increased, cardiac output was not significantly changed. Plasma renin activity was lowered by labetalol, unchanged by metoprolol/nifedipine. Plasma adrenaline increased after metoprolol/nifedipine only, noradrenaline with both regimens. Both combinations significantly lowered stroke work and the rate pressure product and had similar beneficial effects on the onset and the duration of angina. It is concluded that both combinations attenuate or offset the potential adverse hemodynamic effects of beta-receptor blockade alone without loss but rather enhancement of symptomatic efficacy.", 
    "81": "The interaction between oral verapamil and propranolol may involve negative chronotropic, inotropic or dromotropic effects. The immediate effects of orally administered verapamil (120 mg) and propranolol (80 mg), alone and combined, on submaximal exercise hemodynamics and on pharmacokinetics were studied in eight healthy male volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, crossover manner. Maximum effects on heart rate, systolic blood pressure, PR interval and rate-adjusted PR prolongation were greatest with the combined administration of verapamil and propranolol. The combination caused a high frequency of adverse drug events, predominantly exercise fatigue. Verapamil increased the AUC and Cmax and shortened the tmax of propranolol. Propranolol decreased the AUC and Cmax of verapamil. The greater reduction of heart rate with the combination of verapamil and propranolol was only partially explained by higher plasma concentrations of propranolol. The combination of propranolol and verapamil produced clinically important synergistic adverse effects during exercise. Negative dromotropic effects occurred primarily by direct AV node inhibition and were more important than previously recognized.", 
    "82": "We studied the characteristics of binding of cardiac glycosides to particulate membrane fractions from human placenta, to demonstrate that placental tissue is a suitable source of receptors for digitalis drugs. Moreover, we performed preliminary experiments with 125I-labeled digoxin and placental particulates to develop a radioreceptor assay for measurement of endogenous substances with activity similar to cardiac glycoside drugs (EDLS). Placental membrane fractions were incubated with [3H]ouabain (10 nmol/L) or 125I-labeled digoxin (50 pmol/L). With both ligands, binding followed a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics and was saturable. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of sites [for ouabain, KD = 20.2 +/- 5.8 nmol/L (mean +/- SEM), Bmax = 3.1 +/- 0.9 nmol per gram of protein; for digoxin, KD = 29.7 +/- 1.9 nmol/L, Bmax = 24.3 +/- 1.1 nmol per gram of protein]. As expected, digoxin was less potent than ouabain in displacing both tracers from digitalis drugs receptors; progesterone, cortisone, digitoxose, furosemide, bumetanide, and propranolol had no or little effect. Specific 125I-labeled digoxin binding was competitively inhibited by plasma and (or) urine extracts from newborns, adults, pregnant women, and patients with renal insufficiency. Inhibition of binding and volume of plasma and urine assayed were linearly related. These findings support the hypothesis that cardiac glycosides and EDLS can interact with the human placenta and suggest placental tissue to be a suitable source of receptors for cardiac glycosides.", 
    "83": "Atenolol is a newer betablocker, widely used as an antihypertensive drug. It cause a large and rapid fall in IOP when used orally and topically. A total of 33 patients both having normal and raised IOP were included in the study. The drug was given in a dose of 50 mg. tab. orally once a day for 7 days at 8 A.M. and IOP recorded after 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7th day. It produces significant and sustained fall in IOP in both normal and raised IOP patients besides lowering of systematic B.P. and pulse rate. The IOP on patients with systemic hypertension with Atenolol will be reduced and stoppage of therapy may cause glaucoma damage.", 
    "84": "Wide variations in the response to intraocular (IOP)-lowering medications may be due to the normal response of the subjects or to variables unrelated to the effect of medication, eg, noncompliance or recording errors. We used data from a previous study of medications designed to lower IOP to investigate the influence of readings showing an unusually large increase in IOP from baseline on the statistical analysis and conclusions. These readings, which could have been due to variables unrelated to the effect of medication, were defined as \"outliers\" by a statistical method. A statistically insignificant difference between two IOP-lowering medications became significant on excluding two subjects with outlier IOP readings. We explain how reporting results obtained with and without including outliers in the analysis may provide clinicians with more complete information.", 
    "85": "Maintenance effect of the topical beta-blocker timolol on intraocular pressure (IOP) was investigated for a mean follow-up of 31.6 months in a group of 155 patients (275 eyes) with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The mean IOP-value was calculated from 3 readings of the daytime IOP curve, and the mean eye pressure of the right and left eye in the respective individual was used. The medical therapy was carried out with our ranking order of drugs of choice: timolol, timolol combined with adjunctive drug therapy, laser trabeculoplasty and/or filtering surgery. Intraocular pressure was controlled with timolol alone in 98 of 155 patients (63.2%, Group 1). In 36 patients, timolol plus adjunctive medication was required to control IOP (23.2%, Group 2). Twenty-one (13.6%, Group 3) required either laser trabeculoplasty or filtering surgery in addition to timolol. Sufficient IOP-lowering effect was more frequently maintained in patients with ocular hypertension than those with glaucoma simplex or capsular glaucoma. Failures in timolol treatment occurred mostly within 6 months from the start of the therapy and correlated well with higher initial IOP. Transient adverse effects were observed in 11.2% of cases. In three cases (1.9%) local and systemic side effects were serious enough to require discontinuation of the drug therapy. One patient (0.7%) was a non-responder and was withdrawn from the study for that reason. Sixteen patients (10.3%) were lost to follow-up during the 4 year study."
