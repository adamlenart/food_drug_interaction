In this so far largest study we investigated the association between \u03b2-blocker use and lung cancer survival. Therefore, patients with a lung cancer diagnosis between April 1998 and December 2011 were selected from a database linkage of the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the PHARMO Database Network. After matching eligible patients on the propensity score, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression to investigate the association between pre-diagnostic and time-dependent \u03b2-blocker use and overall survival. Duration and dose-response analyses and stratified analyses by \u03b2-blocker type, histological subgroups and stage were conducted. Of 3,340 eligible lung cancer patients, 1437 (43%) took \u03b2-blockers four months prior to diagnosis. Pre-diagnostic \u03b2-blocker use was not associated with overall survival (HR 1.00 (0.92-1.08)) in the adjusted model. Time-dependent post-diagnostic analysis showed similar results with a HR of 1.03 (0.94-1.11). Trend analyses showed no association for cumulative dose (HR 0.99 (0.97-1.02)) and cumulative duration (HR 1.00 (0.96-1.05)). In conclusion, \u03b2-blocker use is not associated with reduced mortality among lung cancer patients.",

Both male and female patients of age between 30 and 80 years with systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 130 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) above 80 mmHg were enrolled in the study. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blocker (\u03b2B), calcium-channel blocker (CCB), diuretics (D), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) as well as \u03b1-blocker classes of antihypertensive drugs were used. These drugs were used as monotherapy as well as combination therapy. The study was conducted for 4 months (July-October). After 4 months, patients were assessed for efficacy by monitoring blood pressure (BP) and tolerability by assessing safety profile on renal function, liver function as well as lipid profile.",

The experimental sorption data determined were fitted to various models, namely, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller; Guggenheim-Anderson-De Boer (GAB); Peleg; and modified GAB. Isosteric heats of sorption were evaluated through the direct use of sorption isotherms by means of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation.",

Based on the statistical data analysis, modified GAB model was found to be more adequate to explain sorption characteristics of CDP. It is noted that the rate of adsorption and desorption is specific to the temperature at which it was being studied. It is observed that isosteric heat of sorption decreased with increasing equilibrium moisture content.",

    "10": "The adipose-derived hormone leptin plays an important role in regulating body weight and glucose homeostasis. Leptin receptors are expressed in the central nervous system as well as peripheral tissues involved in regulating glucose homeostasis, including insulin-producing \u03b2 cells of the pancreas. Previous studies assessing the role of leptin receptors in \u03b2 cells used Cre-loxP to disrupt the leptin receptor gene (Lepr) in \u03b2 cells, but variable results were obtained. Furthermore, recombination of Lepr was observed in the hypothalamus or exocrine pancreas, in addition to the \u03b2 cells, and Lepr in non-\u03b2 cells may have compensated for the loss of Lepr in \u03b2 cells, thus making it difficult to assess the direct effects of Lepr in \u03b2 cells. To determine the significance of Lepr exclusively in \u03b2 cells, we chose to selectively restore Lepr in \u03b2 cells of Lepr null mice (Lepr(loxTB/loxTB)).", 
    "11": "We used a mouse model in which endogenous expression of Lepr was disrupted by a loxP-flanked transcription blocker (Lepr(loxTB/loxTB)), but was restored by Cre recombinase knocked into the Ins1 gene, which is specifically expressed in \u03b2 cells (Ins1Cre). We bred Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) and Ins1Cre mice to generate Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) and Lepr(loxTB/loxTB)Ins1Cre mice, as well as Lepr(wt/wt) and Lepr(wt/wt)Ins1Cre littermate mice. Male and female mice were weighed weekly between 6 and 11 weeks of age and fasting blood glucose was measured during this time. Oral glucose was administered to mice aged 7-12 weeks to assess glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. Relative \u03b2 and \u03b1 cell area and islet size were also assessed by immunostaining and analysis of pancreas sections of 12-14 week old mice.", 
    "12": "Male and female Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) mice, lacking whole-body expression of Lepr, had a phenotype similar to db/db mice characterized by obesity, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, and impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Despite restoring Lepr in \u03b2 cells of Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) mice, fasting insulin levels, blood glucose levels and body weight were comparable between Lepr(loxTB/loxTB)Ins1Cre mice and Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) littermates. Furthermore, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion in male and female Lepr(loxTB/loxTB)Ins1Cre mice were similar to that observed in Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) mice. Analysis of pancreatic insulin positive area revealed that restoration of Lepr in \u03b2 cells of Lepr(loxTB/loxTB) mice did not prevent hyperplasia of insulin positive cells nor did it rescue Glut-2 expression.", 
    "13": "Collectively, these data suggest that direct action of leptin on \u03b2 cells is insufficient to restore normal insulin secretion and glucose tolerance in mice without leptin receptor signaling elsewhere.", 
    "14": "We have revealed that even in humans, activated intrarenal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) enhances tubular sodium reabsorption to facilitate salt sensitivity and nondipper rhythm of blood pressure (BP), and that angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) could increase daytime urinary sodium excretion rate (UNaV) to produce lower sodium balance and restore nondipper rhythm. However, the sympathetic nervous system and intrarenal dopaminergic system can also contribute to renal sodium handling. A total of 20 patients with chronic kidney disease (61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0years) underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring before and during two-day treatment with ARB, azilsartan. Urinary angiotensinogen excretion rate (UAGTV, \u03bcg/gCre) was measured as intrarenal RAAS; urinary dopamine excretion rate (UDAV, pg/gCre) as intrarenal dopaminergic system; heart rate variabilities (HRV, calculated from 24-h Holter-ECG) of non-Gaussianity index \u03bb25s as sympathetic nerve activity; and power of high-frequency (HF) component or deceleration capacity (DC) as parasympathetic nerve activity. At baseline, glomerular filtration rate correlated inversely with UAGTV (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.47, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and positively with UDAV (r\u00a0=\u00a00.58, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). HF was a determinant of night/day BP ratio (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.50, F\u00a0=\u00a05.8), rather than DC or \u03bb25s During the acute phase of ARB treatment, a lower steady sodium balance was not achieved. Increase in daytime UNaV preceded restoration of BP rhythm, accompanied by decreased UAGTV (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.88, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and increased UDAV (r\u00a0=\u00a00.87, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05), but with no changes in HRVs. Diminished sodium excretion can cause nondipper BP rhythm. This was attributable to intrarenal RAAS and dopaminergic system and impaired parasympathetic nerve activity. During the acute phase of ARB treatment, cooperative effects of ARB and intrarenal dopaminergic system exert natriuresis to restore circadian BP rhythm.",

We have recently found that administering a nonselective beta 1,2-adrenergic blocker propranolol (PR) was effective in reversing myelo-erythroid commitment through MafB regulation and increase megakaryocyte erythrocyte progenitors in burn patients' PBMC-derived ex vivo culture system. Having known that Epo-dependent proliferation of early erythroblasts is intact after burn injury, here we inquired whether or not Epo-independent maturation stage of erythropoiesis is affected by burn injury and the relative role of PR on late-stage erythropoiesis. While majority of erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow, maturation into reticulocytes is crucial for their release into sinusoids to occupy the peripheral circulation for which enucleation is vital. PBMCs from burn patients were extended beyond commitment and proliferation stages to late maturation stage in ex vivo culture to understand the role of PR in burn patients. Burn impedes late maturation of orthochromatic erythroblasts into reticulocytes by restricting the enucleation step. Late-stage erythropoiesis is impaired in burn patients irrespective of PR treatment. Further, substituting the microenvironment with control plasma (homologous) in place of autologous plasma rescues the conversion of orthochromatic erythroblasts to reticulocytes. Results show promise in formulating interventions to regulate late-stage erythropoiesis, which can be used in combination with PR to reduce the number of transfusions.",

The physical characteristics of the prepared tablets were evaluated. Characterization of the optimized formulation was performed using Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, the in vitro release profiles of AT formulations were investigated in different pH dissolution media. Drug release kinetics and mechanisms were also determined. The results revealed that there was no potential incompatibility of the drug with the polymer. The release profiles of AT were affected by the concentration of KSR, fillers used, and pH of the dissolution media. The drug release kinetic from most of the formulations obeyed Higuchi diffusion model. The selected formulae were investigated for their stability by storage at 30 and 40\u00b0C with atmospheric humidity and 75% relative humidity (RH), respectively. The results demonstrated that no change in the physicochemical properties of the tablets stored at 30\u00b0C/atmospheric RH in comparison with some changes at 40\u00b0C/75% RH. Finally, the in vivo study provided an evidence that the optimized AT tablet containing 40% KSR and SP.D.L exhibited prominent higher oral bioavailability and more efficient sustained-release effect than the drug alone or the commercial tablet product. It is noteworthy that KSR could be considered as a promising useful release retardant for the production of AT sustained release matrix tablets.",

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone antagonists (angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists) are potential therapies for portal hypertension. Several studies have compared the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker combination therapy vs. \u03b2-blocker monotherapy, with inconsistent results. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of the RAAS inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker combination therapy vs. \u03b2-blocker monotherapy for hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG) reduction in cirrhosis. Studies were obtained using PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane library databases up to July 2015, and the weighted mean difference (WMD) in HVPG reduction was used as a measure of treatment efficacy. In total, three studies (91 patients) were included. When compared to the \u03b2-blocker monotherapy, the RAAS inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker combination therapy resulted in a significant HVPG reduction [WMD 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52-2.88]. However, there was no significant difference in the heart rate reduction between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups (WMD -0.11; 95% CI: -3.51-3.29). In addition, no significant difference in the hemodynamic response was observed between the two groups (WMD 1.46; 95% CI: 0.93-2.30). In conclusion, the RAAS inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker combination therapy reduces portal hypertension significantly and to a greater extent than \u03b2-blocker monotherapy. Both therapies reduced the heart rate to similar levels; however, the RAAS inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker combination therapy reduced the mean arterial pressure to a greater extent. Due to the limited number of studies included, the data available do not allow a satisfactory comparison of adverse events. Moreover, further larger-scale trials are required in order to strengthen the results of the present study.", 
    "42": "We examined whether beta blocker administration in the emergency department (ED) during evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 1-month later. Participants (N = 350) were enrolled in the Reactions to Acute Care and Hospitalization (REACH) study, an ongoing observational cohort study of ED predictors of medical and psychological outcomes after evaluation for suspected ACS. Beta blockade during evaluation in the ED was extracted from medical records, and PTSD symptoms in response to the experience of suspected ACS were assessed 1-month later via telephone. Beta blockade in the ED was associated with lower PTSD symptoms 1-month later, b = -2.80, \u03b2 = -.09, p = .045, after adjustment for demographics, preexisting psychological and medical covariates, and participants' distress during ED evaluation. Despite small effects, findings suggest that beta blockade during ED evaluation for suspected ACS-a time period relevant to fear consolidation of the memory of this potentially life-threatening event-may have protective effects for later psychological health.", 
    "43": "Niflumic acid (NFA) is a member of the fenamate class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This compound and its derivatives are used worldwide clinically for the relief of chronic and acute pain. NFA is also a commonly used blocker of voltage-gated chloride channels. Here we present evidence that NFA is an efficient blocker of chloride-permeable glycine receptors (GlyRs) with subunit heterogeneity of action. Using the whole-cell configuration of patch-clamp recordings and molecular modeling, we analyzed the action of NFA on homomeric \u03b11\u0394Ins, \u03b12B, \u03b13L, and heteromeric \u03b11\u03b2 and \u03b12\u03b2 GlyRs expressed in CHO cells. NFA inhibited glycine-induced currents in a voltage-dependent manner and its blocking potency in \u03b12 and \u03b13 GlyRs was higher than that in \u03b11 GlyR. The Woodhull analysis suggests that NFA blocks \u03b11 and \u03b12 GlyRs at the fractional electrical distances of 0.16 and 0.65 from the external membrane surface, respectively. Thus, NFA binding site in \u03b11 GlyR is closer to the external part of the membrane, while in \u03b12 GlyR it is significantly deeper in the pore. Mutation G254A at the cytoplasmic part of the \u03b11 GlyR pore-lining TM2 helix (level 2') increased the NFA blocking potency, while incorporation of the \u03b2 subunit did not have a significant effect. The Hill plot analysis suggests that \u03b11 and \u03b12 GlyRs are preferably blocked by two and one NFA molecules, respectively. Molecular modeling using Monte Carlo energy minimizations provides the structural rationale for the experimental data and proposes more than one interaction site along the pore where NFA can suppress the ion permeation.",

Using the ACCORD trial (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) data, we performed Cox proportional hazards analyses with a propensity score adjustment. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of a cardiovascular event during the study period, which included nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death.

The \u03b22-adrenergic GPCR can activate Gs-linked cyclic AMP (Gs-cAMP) signaling from endosomes. We show here that the homologous human \u03b21-adrenergic receptor initiates an internal Gs-cAMP signal from the Golgi apparatus. By developing a chemical method to acutely squelch G-protein coupling at defined membrane locations, we demonstrate that Golgi activation contributes significantly to the overall cellular cAMP response. Golgi signaling utilizes a preexisting receptor pool rather than receptors delivered from the cell surface, requiring separate access of extracellular ligands. Epinephrine, a hydrophilic endogenous ligand, accesses the Golgi-localized receptor pool by facilitated transport requiring the organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), whereas drugs can access the Golgi pool by passive diffusion according to hydrophobicity. We demonstrate marked differences, among both agonist and antagonist drugs, in Golgi-localized receptor access and show that \u03b2-blocker drugs currently used in the clinic differ markedly in ability to antagonize the Golgi signal. We propose 'location bias' as a new principle for achieving functional selectivity of GPCR-directed drug action.",

The IOP was measured in 74 eyes in 74 POAG patients (seated) on triple therapy (PG analogue, \u03b2-blocker, carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) at about every 3 hours. Results. The peak IOP was 13.5\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 at 1:00, and the trough IOP was at 12.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4\u2009mmHg at 7:00. The IOP at 7:00 was significantly lower than that at 10:00, 1:00, and 3:00 (p < 0.05).

A literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors.

Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial in 15 clinical sites. Patients with stable angina, taking low-dose \u03b2-blockers (equivalent to metoprolol succinate 23.75-47.5 mg/day), and having a resting HR of \u2265 65 bpm were enrolled and randomized to either the metoprolol 95-mg group or the 190-mg group. The change in 24-h average HR from baseline recorded by Holter monitoring and the percentages of patients with resting HR controlled to \u2264 60 bpm were compared between the two groups. Results: Two hundred thirty-one patients entered the intent-to-treat population for the main analysis. The change in 24-h average HR from baseline was -0.62 \u00b1 0.66 bpm in the 95 mg group and -2.99 \u00b1 0.62 bpm in the 190 mg group (p = 0.0077) after 8 weeks of treatment.

    "71": "Glucokinase-mediated glucose signaling induces insulin secretion, proliferation, and apoptosis in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are not clearly understood. Here, we demonstrated that glucokinase activation using a glucokinase activator (GKA) significantly upregulated the expression of Fibulin-5 (Fbln5), a matricellular protein involved in matrix-cell signaling, in isolated mouse islets. The islet Fbln5 expression was induced by ambient glucose in a time- and dose-dependent manner and further enhanced by high-fat diet or the deletion of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), whereas the GKA-induced increase in Fbln5 expression was diminished in Irs-2-deficient islets. GKA-induced Fbln5 upregulation in the islets was blunted by a glucokinase inhibitor, KATP channel opener, Ca(2+) channel blocker and calcineurin inhibitor, while it was augmented by harmine, a dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) 1\u2009A inhibitor. Although deletion of Fbln5 in mice had no significant effects on the glucose tolerance or \u03b2-cell functions, adenovirus-mediated Fbln5 overexpression increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 rat insulinoma cells. Since the islet Fbln5 expression is regulated through a glucokinase/KATP channel/calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway crucial for the maintenance of \u03b2-cell functions, further investigation of Fbln5 functions in the islets is warranted.", 
    "72": "Obesity-associated hypertension is accompanied by a number of cardiovascular risk factors including vascular insulin resistance (IR) and higher sympathetic nervous activity. Therefore, autonomic blockade was demonstrated to reverse hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and IR in obese individuals. We hypothesized that \u03b2-AR blockade with propranolol would restore endothelial function and vascular insulin signaling in obesity, associated with an anti-inflammatory effect. Body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma biochemical parameters and aortic endothelial function were analyzed in mice fed standard diet (control group) or a high fat diet (HFD) that were treated with vehicle (water) or propranolol (10mg/kg/day) for 8weeks. Propranolol treatment did not modify obesogenic effect of HFD feeding. However, propranolol was effective in preventing the rise in SBP, the hyperinsulinemia and the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and to insulin in obese mice. Protective effect of propranolol administration in endothelial function was associated with increased nitric oxide (NO) production and phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and eNOS (Ser1177), but with reduced phospho-IRS-1(Ser307) and phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204). In addition, \u03b2-blocker propranolol prevented the NF-kB nuclear translocation and the increase in phospho-I\u03baB-\u03b1 (Ser32) and in interleukin(IL)-6 expression in aorta of obese mice, without significant changes in either aortic reactive oxygen species production or in circulating IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels. In \u03b22-AR knockout mice, despite increasing body weight and visceral fat, HFD did not increase SBP and showed a partial improvement of endothelial function, revealing a role of \u03b22-AR in cardiovascular effects of obesity. In conclusion, our results suggest that \u03b2-AR blockade with propranolol is effective to prevent the endothelial dysfunction, vascular IR and pro-inflammatory state displayed in HFD-induced obesity, independent of changes in body weight.",

The contractility was assessed further following the administration of increasing concentrations of the agonists (10-9-10-4 M), both with and without \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (butaxamine - a selective \u03b22- adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol- a non-selective \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist and bupranolol - a non-selective \u03b21-, \u03b22- and \u03b23-adrenoceptor antagonist) at a concentration of 10-4 M. Although neither salbutamol nor BRL 37344 caused changes in the tension, at the highest concentrations they decreased the frequency and amplitude of contractions. These changes were more evident after salbutamol treatment and in the early pregnant group. Antagonists given alone did not cause changes in the parameters examined but changed some activity of the agonists. Butoxamine reduced the decrease in frequency and amplitude induced by salbutamol and produced a decrease in the tension after BRL 37344 treatment in the early pregnant group. Propranolol reduced the decrease in frequency and amplitude induced by salbutamol in both examined groups and did not cause significant changes in BRL 37344 activity. The administration of bupranolol before salbutamol treatment caused an increase in the tension and reduced the decrease in the frequency in the cyclic group. Moreover, bupranolol eliminated a decrease in frequency and induced an increase in amplitude caused by BRL 37344 in both groups and these changes were more evident in the early pregnant group. The data indicates that both \u03b22- and \u03b23-adenoreceptors are involved in the regulation of the contractility in both groups, but the changes after agonists and antagonists treatment are more evident in the early pregnant myometrium.", 
    "89": "In this work, a highly sensitive, citrate anion-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-based assay for the determination of propranolol in real samples with resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) and colorimetry was developed. When AuNPs were prepared by the sodium citrate reduction method, citrate anions self-assembled on the surface of AuNPs to form supramolecular complex anions. In BR 4.6 buffer solution, propranolol was positively charged and could bind with AuNPs to form larger aggregates through electrostatic force and hydrophobic effects. This results in remarkable enhancement of the RRS intensity and a color change in the AuNPs solution from red to blue via purple. Thus, a highly sensitive RRS and colorimetric assay the for detection of propranolol was developed with a linear range of 0.2-5.2 and 8-112\u00a0ng/ml, respectively. In addition, no difference was seen when comparing R-propranolol with S-propranolol, therefore, this method could not be used in the recognition of chiral propranolol. However, upon addition of other \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, no phenomenon like that seen with propranolol was observed, meaning that this method can be used for determining the presence of propranolol in a mixture \u03b2-adrenergic blockers. Finally, the optimum conditions, factors influencing the reaction, its mechanism and the reasons for enhancement of the RRS were discussed.",

    "94": "Regular exercise training is known to affect the action potential duration (APD) and improve heart function, but involvement of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) subtypes and/or the ATP-sensitive K(+) (KATP) channel is unknown. To address this, female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to voluntary wheel-running or control groups; they were anesthetized after 6-8 wk of training, and myocytes were isolated. Exercise training significantly increased APD of apex and base myocytes at 1 Hz and decreased APD at 10 Hz. Ca(2+) transient durations reflected the changes in APD, while Ca(2+) transient amplitudes were unaffected by wheel running. The nonselective \u03b2-AR agonist isoproterenol shortened the myocyte APD, an effect reduced by wheel running. The isoproterenol-induced shortening of APD was largely reversed by the selective \u03b21-AR blocker atenolol, but not the \u03b22-AR blocker ICI 118,551, providing evidence that wheel running reduced the sensitivity of the \u03b21-AR. At 10 Hz, the KATP channel inhibitor glibenclamide prolonged the myocyte APD more in exercise-trained than control rats, implicating a role for this channel in the exercise-induced APD shortening at 10 Hz. A novel finding of this work was the dual importance of altered \u03b21-AR responsiveness and KATP channel function in the training-induced regulation of APD. Of physiological importance to the beating heart, the reduced response to adrenergic agonists would enhance cardiac contractility at resting rates, where sympathetic drive is low, by prolonging APD and Ca(2+) influx; during exercise, an increase in KATP channel activity would shorten APD and, thus, protect the heart against Ca(2+) overload or inadequate filling.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our data demonstrated that regular exercise prolonged the action potential and Ca(2+) transient durations in myocytes isolated from apex and base regions at 1-Hz and shortened both at 10-Hz stimulation. Novel findings were that wheel running shifted the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor agonist dose-response curve rightward compared with controls by reducing \u03b21-adrenergic receptor responsiveness and that, at the high activation rate, myocytes from trained animals showed higher KATP channel function.",

Although initially thought to be harmful in HF, beta-adrenergic blockers (\u03b2-blockers) have consistently been shown to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization in chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction.

    "96": "Metoprolol is a beta blocker used in the treatment of hypertension, angina, and heart failure. Metoprolol selectively blocks beta1 adrenoreceptors mainly expressed in cardiac tissue. Blockade of these receptors reduces the heart rate and decreases the force of heart contractions. Metoprolol is primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Approximately 8% of Caucasians and 2% of most other populations have absent CYP2D6 activity and are known as \u201cCYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\u201d In addition, a number of drugs inhibit CYP2D6 activity, such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone. The FDA-approved drug label for metoprolol states that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, and normal metabolizers who concomitantly take drugs that inhibit CYP2D6, will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol\u2019s cardioselectivity (1). The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group (DPWG) of the Royal\u00a0Dutch\u00a0Association for the Advancement of Pharmacy (KNMP) has published metoprolol dosing recommendations based on CYP2D6 genotype. For individuals who have a CYP2D6 gene variation that reduces the conversion of metoprolol to inactive metabolites, DPWG states that the clinical consequences are limited mainly to the occurrence of asymptomatic bradycardia. For CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, if a gradual reduction in heart rate is desired, or in the event of symptomatic bradycardia, DPWG recommends increasing the dose of metoprolol in smaller steps and/or prescribing no more than 25% of the standard dose. For other cases, no action is required (2). Please note: Beta blockers such as metoprolol have been demonstrated in several large trials to be safe and effective for treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. As a mainstay of therapy associated with improvements in quality of life, hospitalization rates, and survival (3, 4), clinical care pathways that might lead to underutilization of beta blockers require scrutiny. FDA points out that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers will have decreased cardioselectivity for metoprolol due to increased metoprolol blood levels. Yet, it is common clinical practice to adjust the dose of metoprolol according to the patient\u2019s heart rate. FDA does not specifically comment on the role of genetic testing for initiating therapy.",

    "134": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a local growth factor that stimulates cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation by binding to its receptor EGFR. EGF and EGFR are involved in many aspects of the development of carcinomas. Because EGFR has been found to be over-expressed in many tumors of epithelial origin, it is a potential target for antitumor therapy. In this study we designed a mutated form of hEGF (mEGF) with a deletion of four amino acids residues (Gln(43), Tyr(44), Arg(45) and Asp(46)) in order to show importance of Leu spatial location for EGFR binding/activation. Expression vector pET32a(+) and E. Coli, strain Rosetta-gami B (DE3) were used to enhance solubility of the recombinant protein with yielding approximately 10mg/l of cell culture. The purified cleaved hEGF as well as non-cleaved fusion protein were biologically active, which was confirmed by their equal ability to stimulate proliferation of MCF7 cells. The mEGF showed specificity and high affinity for EGFR binding, however binding affinity of mEGF for EGFR was reduced about 11.5 fold compared with that of hEGF. The mEGF effect on the MCF7 cell proliferation had a relatively different outcome; mEGF simulated differential cell growth in a dose dependent manner. On the other hand, in MDA-MB468 cells, hEGF and mEGF induced growth inhibition, which was much more severe for hEGF than that of mEGF. Also, hEGF strongly induced the phosphorylation of EGF receptor in MDA-MB468 cells while mEGF induced poor EGFR phosphorylation. The same observations were also made for migration of cancer cells, especially induction of MDA-MB468 migration by mEGF was significantly lower than that of hEGF, suggesting a connection between tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR and cell migration. Docking analysis revealed that the binding affinity and the buried surface area of mEGF to EGFR complex are lower than those of hEGF/EGFR. Although theoretical studies confirmed reduction in mEGF-EGFR binding affinity, the data of the present study indicate that mEGF is a potential EGFR blocker but may highlight it as excellent delivery agent of protein/non-protein toxins as well as for \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-emitting radio-immunotherapy.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms were not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that catecholamines upregulated the expression of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1) through activating \u03b22-AR-mediated signaling pathway, since selective \u03b22-AR antagonist ICI 118, 551 and non-selective \u03b2-blocker proprenolol effectively repressed isoproterenol (ISO)-induced Sirt1 expression. Catecholamines inhibited doxorubicin (DOX)-induced p53 acetylation and transcription-activation activities by inducing the expression of Sirt1. Knockdown of the Sirt1 expression by the specific siRNA remarkably blocked the inhibitory effects of ISO on DOX-induced p53 acetylation. In addition, we demonstrated that catecholamines induced resistance of cervical cancer cells to chemotherapeutics both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and that \u03b22-AR was overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues.

Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) are a potential primate model for preclinical research, but the detailed roles of marmoset P450 enzymes in metoprolol oxidation remain unknown. In this study, regio- and stereo-selectivity of metoprolol oxidations by a variety of P450 enzymes in marmoset and human livers were investigated in vitro. Although liver microsomes from cynomolgus monkeys and rats preferentially mediated S-metoprolol O-demethylation and R-metoprolol \u03b1-hydroxylation, respectively, those from humans, marmosets, minipigs, and dogs preferentially mediated R-metoprolol O-demethylation, in contrast to the slow rates of R- and S-metoprolol oxidation in mouse liver microsomes. R- and S-metoprolol O-demethylation activities in marmoset livers were strongly inhibited by quinidine and ketoconazole, and were significantly correlated with bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activities and also with P450 2D and 3A4 contents, which is different from the case in human livers that did not have any correlations with P450 3A-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation. Recombinant human P450 2D6 enzyme and marmoset P450 2D6/3A4 enzymes effectively catalyzed R-metoprolol O-demethylation, comparable to the activities of human and marmoset liver microsomes, respectively. These results indicated that the major roles of P450 2D enzymes for the regio- and stereo-selectivity of metoprolol oxidation were similar between human and marmoset livers, but the minor roles of P450 3A enzymes were unique to marmosets.",

Sacubitril/valsartan represents a first-in-class drug acting through inhibition of angiotensin receptor and neprilysin, thus modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and vasoactive substances such as natriuretic peptides. This approach can be considered a \"paradigm shift\" from neurohumoral inhibition to neurohumoral modulation. Based on the PARADIGM-HF results, the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines proposed a substitution of ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy rather than an \"add-on\" strategy in HFrEF.

However, the risk of long-term side effects of the ARNI such as cognitive dysfunction or Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. In fact, neprilysin (NEP), encoded by NEP or MME gene, is a principal peptidase involved in the degradation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) protein. Several studies have demonstrated that polymorphisms of the NEP gene may be associated with AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Pharmacogenomics, the study of variability in drug response due to genetic polymorphisms, can potentially explain the variability in the effect of the ARNI and their side effects. Therefore, we have attempted to highlight pharmacogenomic factors and potential long-term side effects of the ARNI.

RyR2 macromolecular complex remodeling, characterized by depletion of the regulatory protein calstabin2, resulted in increased cytosolic Ca(2+) levels and mitochondrial oxidative stress. We also report a functional interplay between amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2), \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, and altered Ca(2+) signaling via leaky RyR2 channels. Thus, post-translational modifications of RyR occur downstream of A\u03b2 through a \u03b22-adrenergic signaling cascade that activates PKA. RyR2 remodeling in turn enhances \u03b2APP processing. Importantly, pharmacological stabilization of the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 channels, which prevents Ca(2+) leakage, or blocking the \u03b22-adrenergic signaling cascade reduced \u03b2APP processing and the production of A\u03b2 in APPswe-expressing SH-SY5Y cells. We conclude that targeting RyR-mediated Ca(2+) leakage may be a therapeutic approach to treat AD.",

Prompted by such studies, we investigated an association between beta-blocker drug use with improved cancer-specific survival in a large, general population-based cohort of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). All patients diagnosed with a first primary PDAC in Sweden between 2006 and 2009 were identified through the Swedish Cancer Register (n = 2,394). We obtained information about use of beta-blockers and other medications through linkage with the national Prescribed Drug Register. Cancer-specific mortality was assessed using the Swedish Cause of Death Register. We used multivariable Cox regression adjusted for sociodemographic factors, tumor characteristics, comorbidity score, and other medications to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer-specific mortality associated with beta-blocker use during the 90-day period before cancer diagnosis. A total of 2,054 (86%) died, with pancreatic cancer recorded as the underlying cause of death during a maximum of 5-year follow-up (median 5 months). Patients who used beta-blockers (n = 522) had a lower cancer-specific mortality rate than nonusers (adjusted HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90; P < 0.001). This observed rate reduction was more pronounced among patients with localized disease at diagnosis (n = 517; adjusted HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43-0.83; P = 0.002), especially for users with higher daily doses (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.83; P = 0.005).

IPAVA have been routinely observed in healthy humans with exercise, hypoxia, and catecholamine infusion, but the mechanism by which they are recruited is not well-defined. We hypothesized that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation recruits IPAVA and that receptor blockade would limit hypoxia-induced IPAVA recruitment. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the transpulmonary passage of microspheres in intact rats and isolated rats lung infused with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. We also evaluated IPAVA recruitment in intact rats with hypoxia and the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol. We found that IPAVA are recruited in the intact rat by isoproterenol and their recruitment by hypoxia can be minimized by propranolol, suggesting a role for the adrenergic system in the recruitment of IPAVA by hypoxia. IPAVA recruitment is completely abolished by ventilation with 100% oxygen. Isoproterenol also recruits IPAVA in isolated rat lungs. The fact that isoproterenol can recruit IPAVA in isolated lungs, without increased pulmonary flow, suggests that elevated cardiac output is not required for IPAVA recruitment.",

Propranolol is a nonselective beta-blocker that crosses the blood-brain barrier because of its high lipophilicity, which increases the likelihood of central nervous system effects. In this case, a preterm infant developed infantile hemangiomas on the left forearm, left trunk, left buttock, and nasal tip. The patient was treated with propranolol and concurrently required placement into a heated incubator and was subsequently unable to wean from the incubator.

Combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have been associated with improvements in hospital admissions and mortality from heart failure compared with enalapril, and guidelines now recommend substitution of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNIs in appropriate patients. Improved safety of left ventricular assist devices means that these are becoming more commonly used in patients with severe symptoms. Antidiabetic therapies might further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as cardiac myosin activators, are under investigation for patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous disorder that remains incompletely understood and will continue to increase in prevalence with the ageing population. Although some data suggest that spironolactone might improve outcomes in these patients, no therapy has conclusively shown a significant effect.

However, the relationship between KCa3.1 expression and oxidative stress, the important factor of promoting fibrosis, has not been clearly established. This study was designed to investigate whether the role of oxidative stress in promoting myocardial fibrosis is related to KCa3.1 channel by using biochemical approaches. It was found that mean blood pressure, plasma Ang II level, and myocardium malondialdehyde (MDA) content of angiotensinogen-renin (AGT-REN) double transgenic hypertension (dTH) mice were higher than those in wild-type (WT) mice of the same age (4, 8 and 12\u00a0months) and were significantly increased with age. However, plasma Ang (1-7) level and myocardium superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity showed a downward trend and were lower than those of the same-aged WT mice (4, 8 and 12\u00a0months). In addition, protein expression of myocardium KCa3.1 channel in 4-, 8-, and 12-month-old dTH mice were significantly higher than that of the same-aged WT mice and gradually increased with age. TRAM-34, a blocker of KCa3.1 channel, and losartan mitigated the myocardial structural and functional damage by inhibiting collagen deposition and decreasing the expression of \u03b2-MHC. After intervention of ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and NADPH inhibitor apocynin (Apo) in 6-month-old dTH mice for 4\u00a0weeks, myocardial oxidative stress level was reduced and KCa3.1 channel protein expression was decreased. Meanwhile, Apo inhibited the myocardium p-ERK1/2/T-ERK protein expression in dTH mice, and after blockage of ERK1/2 pathway with PD98059, the KCa3.1 protein expression was reduced. These results demonstrate for the first time that KCa3.1 channel is likely to be a critical target on the oxidative stress for its promoting role in myocardial fibrosis, and the ERK1/2 pathway may be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress to KCa3.1.",

First, guidelines and risk assessment tools were searched for patient characteristics indicating a high risk of drug-related problems. Second, a systematic PubMed search was conducted to identify risk factors significantly associated with adverse health outcomes after discharge that are potentially modifiable by a clinical pharmacist intervention. After the PubMed search, 37 studies were included, reporting 16 risk factors. Only seven of 34 patient characteristics mentioned in pertinent guidelines corresponded to one of these risk factors. Diabetes mellitus (n = 11), chronic obstructive lung disease (n = 9), obesity (n = 7), smoking (n = 5) and polypharmacy (n = 5) were the risk factors reported most frequently in the studies. Additionally, single studies also found associations of adverse health outcomes with different drug classes {e.g. warfarin [hazard ratio 1.50; odds ratio (OR) 3.52], furosemide [OR 2.25] or high beta-blocker starting doses [OR 3.10]}. Although several modifiable risk factors were found, many patient characteristics supposedly indicating a high risk of drug-related problems were not part of the assessed risk factors in the context of an increased risk of adverse health outcomes after discharge. Therefore, an obligatory set of modifiable patient characteristics should be created and implemented in future studies investigating the risk for adverse health outcomes after discharge.",

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the toxic response of the crustacean Daphnia magna exposed to individual and combined pharmaceuticals. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor widely prescribed as antidepressant, and propranolol, a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent used to treat hypertension, were tested. Several experimental trials of an acute immobilization test and a chronic reproduction test were performed. Single chemicals were first tested separately. Toxicity of binary mixtures was then assessed using a fixed ratio experimental design. Five concentrations and 5 percentages of each substance in the mixture (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%) were tested. The MIXTOX model was applied to analyze the experimental results. This tool is a stepwise statistical procedure that evaluates if and how observed data deviate from a reference model, either concentration addition (CA) or independent action (IA), and provides significance testing for synergism, antagonism, or more complex interactions. Acute EC50 values ranged from 6.4 to 7.8\u2009mg/L for propranolol and from 6.4 to 9.1\u2009mg/L for fluoxetine. Chronic EC50 values ranged from 0.59 to 1.00\u2009mg/L for propranolol and from 0.23 to 0.24\u2009mg/L for fluoxetine. Results showed a significant antagonism between chemicals in both the acute and the chronic mixture tests when CA was adopted as the reference model, while absence of interactive effects when IA was used.", 
    "231": "The main terminology used to describe heart failure (HF) is based on measurement of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). LVEF in the range of 40-49% was recently defined as HF with mid-range EF (HFmrEF) by the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The purpose of our study was to assess the clinical profile and prognosis of patients with HF according to this new classification.", 
    "232": "A total of 482 patients referred for HF were retrospectively included over a period of 1\u00a0year. There were 258 (53%), 115 (24%), and 109 (23%) patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), HFmrEF, and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF), respectively. Patient age increased, whereas left block bundle branch, brain natriuretic peptide level, and the use of beta-blocker and furosemide decreased from HFrEF to HFpEF. After adjustment for the age, patients with HFpEF and HFmrEF were more likely to have NYHA stage 2 dyspnea, had a higher systolic blood pressure, were less likely to have spironolactone, had lower furosemide dose, and had lower haemoglobin than those with HFrEF. Cardiovascular risk factors and medical history were similar in the three groups of patients. There was a 33% death rate after a mean follow-up of 32.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3\u00a0months. The survival was the same among patients whatever the group of HF (P = 0.884).",

Patients with HFmrEF have a different clinical profile, which is nearly the same as patients with HFpEF, except for sex. These results question the relevance of this new classification of HF to stimulate research into this new group of patients.",

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that determined the effect of add-on spironolactone on blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension compared with a control group. A total of five RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Spironolactone reduced office systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 15.73 mmHg (95% CI -20.45 to -11.0; P < 0.00001) and office diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 6.21 mmHg (95% CI -8.33 to -4.1, P < 0.00001) as compared to placebo group. The pooled changes of 24 h ambulatory or home SBP and DBP were -8.7 mmHg (95% CI -8.79 to -8.62, P < 0.00001) and -4.12 mmHg (95% CI -4.48 to -3.75, P < 0.00001), in favor of the spironolactone group. In comparison with alternative drugs including beta-blocker, candesartan, or alpha methyldopa, spironolactone reduced home SBP by 4.5 mmHg (95% CI -4.63 to -4.37, P < 0.00001). Addition of spironolactone provides benefit effect on blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.",

They were randomly assigned into either Group 1 who received Timolol 0.5% eye drops for 3 months or Group 2 who received artificial tears as control (during treatment). Patients were followed an additional 2 months after cessation of eye drops treatment (posttreatment).", 
    "237": "During treatment in Group 1, as the mean true intraocular pressure (IOPT) lowered significantly, regression stopped. As the mean IOPT increased significantly posttreatment and returned to its pretreatment level, regression recurred. The effective rate of Timolol therapy dropped from 62.5% during treatment to 40.6% posttreatment. On the contrary in Group 2, although the mean IOPT did not change significantly, regression continually happened as time passed. During treatment, the mean IOPT, uncorrected visual acuity, spherical equivalent (SE), and corneal refractive power showed significant difference between the 2 groups. In Group 1, the differences of effective rate of Timolol therapy between each of the 2 subgroups of age, gender, preoperative SE (PSE), or pretreatment time (how long we start treatment with Timolol post-LASIK) were not statistically significant.",

Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 15 patients (30 per cent) receiving placebo versus five (10 per cent) receiving landiolol (P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7012). The overall incidence of postoperative complications was significantly lower in the landiolol group (P\u2009=\u20090\u00b7046). In the landiolol group, postoperative heart rate was suppressed effectively, but the decrease in BP was not harmful.

Blood concentrations of landiolol and its metabolites, heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram parameters were studied in 12 healthy volunteers receiving continuous infusions of a new 12-mg/mL formulation of landiolol using a dose-escalation regimen (10 \u03bcg/kg BW/min for 2 hours, 20 \u03bcg/kg BW/min for 2 hours, 40 \u03bcg/kg BW/min for 20 hours, 6 hours follow-up). Landiolol blood concentrations were dose proportional. Time until steady state decreased with increasing doses. Pharmacokinetic parameters were t1/2 = 4.5 minutes, VD = 366 mL/kg, and total body clearance = 53 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min. Maximal blood concentrations of the inactive main metabolite M1 were 10-fold higher than those of landiolol, with t1/2 = 126 minutes, VD = 811 mL/kg, and total body clearance = 4.5 mL\u00b7kg\u00b7min. HR reduction from baseline was fast (significant after 16 minutes) and sustained throughout the administration period. Systolic and diastolic BP reductions and electrocardiogram parameter changes were less pronounced and became significant only occasionally. Recovery after discontinuation of infusion was fast with little (HR) or no (BP) rebound. The new formulation showed excellent local and general tolerability.",

Patients taking beta-blockers exhibited a significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1, and %FVC, and a more advanced GOLD stage. The mean duration of beta-blocker administration was 2.8\u00b11.7 years.

Kneading method was used to prepare CAR-HP\u03b2CD inclusion complex (KD). The action of different carriers separately and in combination on Carvedilol solubility was investigated in three series. CAR-carrier and KD-carrier solid dispersions were prepared by solvent evaporation method. In vitro dissolution test was conducted in three different media: double-distilled water (DDW), simulative gastric fluid (SGF), and PBS pH\u00a06.8 (PBS). The interactions between CAR, HP\u03b2CD, and different carriers were explored by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and differential scanning colorimetry (DSC). The results showed higher solubility of CAR in KD-PVP solid dispersions up to 70, 25, and 22\u00a0fold compared to pure CAR in DDW, SGF, and PBS, respectively. DSC and XRD analyses indicated an improved degree of transformation of CAR in KD-PVP solid dispersion from crystalline to amorphous state. This study provides a new successful combination of two polymers with the dual action of HP\u03b2CD and PLX/PVP on water solubility and bioavailability of CAR."
