The study group consisted of 100 consecutive patients undergoing exercise TI-201 testing and coronary angiography who were found to have maximal coronary artery diameter narrowing of less than 50%. Maximal coronary stenosis ranged from 0 to 40%. The independent and relative influences of patient clinical, exercise and angiographic data were assessed by logistic regression analysis. Significant predictors of a positive stress TI-201 test result were: (1) percent maximal coronary stenosis (p less than 0.0005), (2) propranolol use (p less than 0.01), (3) interaction of propranolol use and percent maximal stenosis (p less than 0.005), and (4) stress-induced chest pain (p = 0.05). No other patient variable had a significant influence. Positive TI-201 test results were more common in patients with 21 to 40% maximal stenosis (59%) than in patients with 0 to 20% maximal stenosis (27%) (p less than 0.01). Among patients with 21 to 40% stenosis, a positive test response was more common when 85% of maximal predicted heart rate was achieved (75%) than when it was not (40%) (p less than 0.05). Of 16 nonapical perfusion defects seen in patients with 21 to 40% maximal stenosis, 14 were in the territory that corresponded with such a coronary stenosis. Patients taking propranolol were more likely to have a positive TI-201 test result (45%) than patients not taking propranolol (22%) (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "In humans, reflex sympathetic nerve activation modulates the direct cardiac action of nifedipine after systemic administration and results in a positive chronotropic and inotropic response. The coronary hemodynamic and metabolic effects of nifedipine were evaluated after propranolol-induced acute beta-receptor blockade in 12 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease. The intravenous injection of propranolol led to a decrease in heart rate, coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen consumption and an increase in coronary vascular resistance and the coronary arteriovenous oxygen difference. Mean aortic pressure did not change. The subsequent intravenous administration of nifedipine resulted in a transient increase in coronary blood flow and a reduction in coronary vascular resistance and the coronary arteriovenous oxygen difference and a sustained decrease in mean aortic pressure and myocardial oxygen consumption without significant changes in heart rate. Thus, in the presence of beta-receptor blockade, the positive chronotropic response to nifedipine is attenuated and nifedipine reduces myocardial oxygen consumption significantly. The vasodilatory effect of nifedipine is maintained and a potential propranolol-related inappropriate vasoconstriction may be reversed. The combination of nifedipine and beta-receptor blocking agents may be useful in the treatment of patients with both effort-induced angina and angina related to changes in coronary vasomotor tone.", 
    "2": "As part of the Veterans Administration cooperative studies on antihypertensive agents, systolic time intervals (STIs) were recorded before and after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) alone in 320 asymptomatic patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After treatment with HCTZ, left ventricular ejection time corrected for heart rate (delta LVET) was significantly reduced. This decrease is consistent with other hemodynamic observations indicating a reduced preload and stroke volume after administration of thiazides. Electromechanical systole corrected for heart rate (delta QS2) decreased, while the ratio of preejection period to LVET (PEP/LVET) increased, reflecting reduced left ventricular function. PEP did not change. Four step 2 drugs--hydralazine, prazosin, oxprenolol and propranolol--were then added randomly to HCTZ and further recordings of STIs were taken at 1 and 6 months after administration of these drugs. The delta LVET and delta QS2 increased and PEP/LVET decreased, suggesting improved left ventricular function after administration of all 4 agents. These changes may have been due to the added agents or to the recovery of cardiac output that occurs independently during long-term treatment with thiazide diuretic drugs alone. PEP decreased slightly after hydralazine and prazosin and increased slightly after treatment with the beta-blocking drugs, although none of these changes were significant except those during hydralazine treatment. Processing of the STIs was greatly facilitated by the automated system for recording and analyzing the measurements.", 
    "3": "Systolic time intervals (STI) were correlated with radionuclide angiography studies (RAS) in 57 patients at rest, during maximal semisitting bicycle exercise, and at 4 minutes following the cessation of exercise. Eleven were judged as being free of coronary artery disease (group 1), while 14 had coronary artery disease without (group 2A), and 27 (group 2B) with a previous transmural myocardial infarction. For RAS, resting radionuclide ejection fraction (REF), the changes in REF and end-systolic volume, and the development of a wall motion abnormality at peak exercise were each highly correlated with the presence of coronary disease (p less than 0.001). The accuracy of STI parameters in predicting the presence of coronary disease was poor (less than 60%). Changes in end-diastolic volume (EDV) correlated significantly with PEP/LVET and LVET1 changes following exercise. Moreover, patients with an abnormal (greater than 25%) increase in EDV at peak exercise had a greater increase in LVET1 in the postexercise period (p less than 0.01). We conclude that STI is not accurate enough a predictor of coronary disease or left ventricular function to serve as a useful screening test. Changes in STI parameters appear to be more related to changes in ventricular volume than to ventricular function.", 
    "4": "Long-acting propranolol (propranolol-LA) was compared with propranolol in divided doses in 18 patients with essential tremor. Three patients were unresponsive to both preparations. Propranolol-LA was preferred by 87% of patients for ease of administration and by 67% for tremor control. Propranolol-LA provided similar (53%), and in some patients greater (47%), reduction of tremor amplitude than divided dosing. Propranolol-LA should be a useful drug in essential tremor.", 
    "5": "Ten patients with cirrhosis and protal hypertension received an initial 20 mg oral test dose of propranolol and subsequently 160 mg of a slow release preparation, orally, each day for seven days. Protein binding, serial plasma propranolol concentrations and effects on heart rate were studied. Protein binding was slightly reduced (mean 85%, range 78.9-88.1%) compared with four normals (mean 87.9%). In patients with severe liver disease (serum albumin less than 30 g/l) propranolol remained detectable in plasma 24 hours after the single 20 mg dose and high steady state concentrations (mean 266.5 ng/ml, range 84-406) were observed during regular dosing. At steady state there was a significant correlation between log total plasma propranolol concentrations and the percentage fall in heart rate (r = 0.659, p less than 0.05). We suggest that in patients with severe liver chronic disease (serum albumin less than 30 g/l), propranolol therapy should be initiated in hospital. The starting dose should be low (20 mg of the conventional formulation tds or 80 mg of the slow release preparation daily) and that regular monitoring of the heart rate should be carried out.", 
    "6": "Sotalol, a noncardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent without partial agonist activity, has class-3 antiarrhythmic effects. Twenty-nine patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias were treated on 31 occasions to determine the effective therapeutic dosage and optimal method of administration. Fifty percent of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, 33 percent of those with atrial flutter, and 20 percent with atrial fibrillation were restored to sinus rhythm by bolus administration; and when sotalol was given by continuous infusion, sinus rhythm was obtained in 100 percent, 86 percent, and 33 percent, respectively. Comparable dosages were given to both responders and nonresponders in the bolus-treated group and higher dosages to nonresponders than to responders in those treated by infusion. Furthermore, plasma levels in nonresponders tended to be higher than in responders. When responders alone were considered, the average dose required was 0.630 +/- 0.090 mg/kg of body weight (+/- SE), and the plasma level obtained was 0.526 +/- 0.088 microgram/ml. No relationship between plasma levels and therapeutic effectiveness was shown. No serious side effects were observed at the dosages used. These data suggest that while no concordance with plasma levels was observed, sotalol given by infusion is an effective therapy for atrial flutter and supra-ventricular tachycardia. It is less effective in atrial fibrillation, where less than half were responders, but a satisfactory reduction in ventricular rate response was obtained. A controlled trial to further substantiate these findings is indicated.", 
    "7": "We report a liquid-chromatographic method for assay of total and free propranolol and its metabolite, propranolol glycol, in plasma. An ultrafiltration device is used to separate the free drugs from the protein-bound drugs. The total and free drugs are isolated from plasma or ultrafiltrate by liquid-solid extraction on a Waters C18 SEP-PAK and the drugs are quantified on a C18 mu-Bondpak radial-compression column. The mobile phase consists of equal parts of methanol and a solution of potassium 50 mmol/L phosphate and 2.5 mmol/L 1-pentane-sulfonic acid, pH 5.0. Detection was by fluorescence, with excitation at 296 nm and emission at 338 nm. Time required for sample preparation for total-propranolol assay is 40 min per eight samples. Sample preparation for free-propranolol assay requires an additional 1 h per eight samples. Chromatography requires 15 min per sample. The extraction recovery is approximately 75% and the assay curve is linear from 5 to 400 micrograms/L. The run-to-run CV is 4% for total propranolol, 15% for free propranolol.", 
    "8": "The clinical, electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic determinants and effects of antiarrhythmic agents on sustained sinus node reentrant tachycardia remain poorly defined. Of 65 consecutive men undergoing electrophysiologic studies for symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia over a 4 year period, 11 (16.9%), who ranged in age from 39 to 76 years, demonstrated sustained sinus node reentrant tachycardia. On the surface electrocardiogram, before electrophysiologic studies, the following diagnoses were considered in the 11 patients: sinus node reentrant tachycardia on the basis of an RP'/P'R ratio of greater than 1 and P wave configuration similar to that of sinus P waves (7 patients); atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia on the basis of an RP'/P'R ratio of less than 1 (3 patients); and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block (1 patient). All 11 patients had a history of recurrent palpitation, 4 had syncope, 2 had dizzy spells and 9 had organic heart disease. Sustained sinus node reentrant tachycardia could be reproducibly induced in all 11 patients during atrial pacing or premature atrial stimulation, or both, over a wide echo zone. The tachycardia could be terminated by carotid sinus massage, atrial pacing and premature atrial stimulation. Characteristics of tachycardia included: high-low activation sequence; cycle lengths of 250 to 590 ms with wide fluctuations of 20 to 180 ms in individual patients; RP'/P'R ratio of greater than 1 in 8 (73%) of the 11 patients and a ratio of less than 1 in 3 (27%). Induction of sustained sinus node reentrant tachycardia was prevented by intravenous ouabain (0.01 mg/kg body weight) in two of two patients, by intravenous verapamil (10 mg) in two of two patients and by intravenous amiodarone (5 mg/kg body weight) in four of four patients. In contrast, intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg body weight) did not affect induction of sustained sinus node reentrant tachycardia in two of two patients. It is concluded that sustained sinus node reentrant tachycardia, seen in 16.9% of the study patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, is not as benign as previously believed; it is frequently associated with organic heart disease; it demonstrates wide variations in cycle length, unlike other forms of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia; it can masquerade as AV nodal reentrant tachycardia and paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block on the surface electrocardiogram in 36% of patients; and it is responsive to intravenous administration of ouabain, verapamil or amiodarone.", 
    "9": "Using sonar microcrystals implanted in conscious dogs, we have characterized left ventricular segmental relaxation (LVSR) by measuring the mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning (RHEDT) and the late diastolic thinning fraction (TF). In protocol 1 (five nonischemic dogs), RHEDT correlated with changes in left ventricular dP/dt (r = .87) and systemic arterial pressure (r = -.80) but not with alterations in heart rate. Only systemic arterial pressure importantly influenced TF (r = -.65). In protocol 2 (21 dogs), LVSR paralleled net systolic segmental wall thickness (NET) during both 2 and 4 hr of coronary occlusion followed by 1 month reperfusion. Both LVSR and NET remained depressed during 2 and 4 hr of coronary occlusion and through 24 hr of reperfusion, but both also gradually improved afterwards. In protocol 3, 31 dogs underwent 4 hr of coronary occlusion with 1 month of reperfusion. Among these animals, 11 dogs (group S4) received saline after 1 hr of occlusion, nine dogs (group P4) received propranolol, and 11 dogs (group D4) received diltiazem. Drug therapy was stopped at 2 hr of reperfusion. In segments with mildly and moderately depressed NET, LVSR was significantly increased in group D4 vs group S4 animals during the diltiazem infusion. Expressed as mean percentage of control value +/- SEM, RHEDT of moderately dysfunctional segments in group D4 compared with group S4 measured 53 +/- 10% vs 25 +/- 5%, respectively, at 2 hr of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (p = .03), 76 +/- 17% vs 28 +/- 8%, respectively, at 4 hr of occlusion (p = .01), and 74 +/- 11% vs 33 +/- 10%, respectively, at 1 hr of reperfusion (p less than .05). The differences in TF at these same time points were 106 +/- 10% vs 70 +/- 9% (p less than .03), 105 +/- 7% vs 65 +/- 16% (p less than .02), and 106 +/- 11% vs 74 +/- 13% (p less than .05), respectively. The improvement in LVSR occurred independently of changes in NET. The values of LVSR in the diltiazem-treated dogs fell to the levels of groups S4 and P4 within 24 hr of stopping the intervention. Propranolol did not significantly alter LVSR over the short or long term. The increase in LVSR during administration of diltiazem did not appear to be mediated by changes in contractility or regional myocardial blood flow, but were probably mediated in part by afterload reduction and possibly by a reduction in calcium entry into ischemic myocardium.", 
    "10": "The efficacy of a single oral dose combination of 120 mg diltiazem and 160 mg propranolol in terminating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) was evaluated in 15 patients. All 15 patients underwent electrical induction of PSVT that lasted longer than 15 min, and all underwent randomized crossover placebo and diltiazem and propranolol studies on 2 consecutive days. On each day PSVT was induced and placebo or diltiazem and propranolol was administered 15 min later. Electrical conversion of PSVT was performed when severe symptoms occurred or at the end of 240 min. With placebo PSVT lasted 164 +/- 89 (mean +/- SD) min; four patients had spontaneous conversion. With diltiazem and propranolol PSVT lasted 39 +/- 49 min (p less than .001); 14 patients had spontaneous conversion in an average of 27 +/- 15 min. None of the 14 patients had electrical reinduction of sustained PSVT after conversion. The sinus nodal recovery time during spontaneous or electrical conversion of PSVT was 911 +/- 459 msec with placebo and 1076 +/- 270 msec with diltiazem and propranolol (NS). Two patients developed transient second-degree atrioventricular block and junctional rhythm while on diltiazem and propranolol. Serum diltiazem and propranolol levels (ng/ml) after diltiazem and propranolol in five patients were, respectively, 49 +/- 26 and 108 +/- 101 at 15 min, 232 +/- 147 and 228 +/- 148 at 30 min, 254 +/- 169 and 370 +/- 393 at 45 min, 280 +/- 115 and 209 +/- 189 at 60 min, 188 +/- 72 and 268 +/- 264 at 120 min, and 118 +/- 57 and 265 +/- 148 at 240 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The metabolism and disposition of a new antihypertensive and antianginal agent, 3,4-dihydro-8-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino)propoxy- 3-nitroxy-2H-1-benzopyran (nipradilol, K-351) were studied using its [14C]-labelled compound in rats. The plasma level of radioactivity reached the maximum 1 h after oral administration, and the majority of radioactivities administered were recovered in urine and via the bile in feces within 48 h. From the foregoing it is obvious that the drug was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract rapidly and well, and was eliminated from the body completely. The unchanged drug detected in the plasma and urine after oral administration of 30 mg/kg was more than 10 times as much as that after 3 mg/kg. This fact indicates that the first-pass metabolism of the drug has been saturated. Denitronipradilol, 4- and 5-hydroxynipradilol, and 4- and 5-hydroxydenitronipradilol were identified as major metabolites in the plasma and excreta, and the degradation compounds of the aminohydroxypropoxy side chain were also found as minor metabolites. Among these metabolites, 4-hydroxy metabolites were found mainly as unconjugates and 5-hydroxy metabolites as glucuronides, respectively. These findings suggest that the possible metabolic pathways of nipradilol in rats involve reductive denitration of the nitroxy group, hydroxylation at the benzopyran skeleton, oxidative degradation of the beta-blocking side chain and their glucuronidation.", 
    "12": "The possibility that the catecholaminergic (CA) system might be involved in calcitonin (CT)-induced analgesia was examined. The administration of the neurotoxin for CA neurons, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) significantly reduced salmon CT (sCT) analgesia as measured in rats by the hot-plate test. Pretreatment with an alpha- and beta-blocker (phentolamine and propranolol) was also effective in lowering significantly the activity of sCT. When the two drugs were administered alone, propranolol, but not phentolamine, reduced the analgesic effect of sCT. A more pronounced and long-lasting inhibitory effect on sCT-analgesia was obtained using atenolol (selective beta 1-receptor blocker). The present data support the role of the CA system in sCT-induced analgesic activity.", 
    "13": "A patient with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy (AILD) is presented. Manifestations of the disease appeared after short-term treatment with oxprenolol hydrochloride. Following treatment with prednisone, the patient remained in remission for 25 months. The disease relapsed following reuse of oxprenolol hydrochloride. Severe pancytopenia due to bone marrow involvement by AILD and myelofibrosis led to a fatal outcome. The association of AILD and myelofibrosis has been rarely encountered and is hereby discussed. In addition, the possible relationship between AILD and oxprenolol hydrochloride is considered.", 
    "14": "Healthy males (23-29 years) volunteered as subjects. We studied the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide and to isometric exercise (50% of maximum voluntary contraction) after administration of propranolol (20 mg), mepindolol (5 mg), salbutamol (20 mg) and placebo (single dose orally). The increase of pulmonary ventilation (VE) activated by central (CO2) and reflex stimulus (hand-grip) did not differ statistically between the four drugs. Analysis of VE in terms of inspiratory drive (Vt/Ti) and timing ratio (Ti/Ttot) showed that during CO2 stimulation mepindolol and salbutamol increased VE predominantly by the increase of Vt/Ti, presumably through the direct stimulation on the respiratory center. During rebreathing, Ti/Ttot increased significantly after administration of placebo and propranolol, so VE increased by a rise of Vt/Ti and by an increase of an effective 'timing component' (Ti/Ttot). Propranolol does not modify the ventilatory response to CO2 and hand-grip when VE is analyzed in terms of Vt/Ti and Ti/Ttot.", 
    "15": "First, it was confirmed that systemic injection of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine HBr (30 mg/kg IP) depleted noradrenaline levels in rat heart, but not centrally. Losses averaged 90% of control 1 day after injection, and 50% at 42 days. The same drug and dose was then administered to 50% of a group of rats which had been trained to lever-press for food reward on continuous reinforcement (CRF). After further CRF sessions, the rats were changed to a schedule of Differential Reinforcement of Low Rates of Response with a 20-s criterion (DRL 20). The drugged rats earned fewer reinforcements during DRL than did controls, and made fewer responses. Temporal discrimination (shown by the IRT/Opp distribution) was disrupted. It is concluded that peripheral noradrenergic systems may be involved in the control over responding by temporal cues associated with reward and non-reward.", 
    "16": "Ten rats were trained to lever press for food reward on a schedule of differential reinforcement of low rates of response with a 20-s criterion (DRL 20). Ten more were trained on a new schedule of punishment, designed to be comparable to DRL 20 - differential punishment of high rates of response (DPH 20). Under this schedule, responses with a latency of 20 s or more earned food rewards, while those of less than 20 s were followed by food reward and brief electric footshock. After 42 sessions, rats on each schedule showed temporal discrimination in the distribution of inter-response times. The effects on these baselines of the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 1 mg/kg IP) and the beta-blocker propranolol (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg IP) were investigated. Both drugs reduced numbers of responses reaching criterion (criterion responses) in DPH, CDP increasing total responses. CDP acted similarly under DRL, but propranolol only affected performance at the highest dose, which reduced criterion responses, probably because of changes in total responding. Each drug increased response bursts. It is concluded that propranolol can exert a disinhibitory action in these schedules, although with some differences from that of the benzodiazepine CDP.", 
    "17": "Rats were administered with different doses of d,l-propranolol or d,l-propranolol plus amphetamine before open-field observations. Results show that d,l-propranolol decreased locomotion and rearing frequencies and increased immobility duration in rats. An antagonism between the effects of amphetamine and d,l-propranolol on general activity of rats was also observed. Results are discussed in the light of a possible interference of the drugs with the activity of either noradrenergic neurons or mid-brain reticular formation.", 
    "18": "Forty-eight sequential narcoleptic patients were treated with propranolol (80-240 mg/day) for an average period of 18.4 months. Initially all patients received single drug therapy; after 10 days or longer, however, 50% of patients also received tricyclics or stimulants because propranolol alone did not sufficiently suppress the narcoleptic symptoms. Fifty percent of patients judged the initial effectiveness of propranolol on daytime sleepiness to be good to very good; in these patients the effects seemed comparable to that of pemoline. Within 6 months, however, the effectiveness started to decrease, and after 26 months only 8% (2 out of 24) of those patients taking the single drug were satisfied with propranolol therapy alone. Side effects included disturbed night sleep, decreased blood pressure, increased lethargy, allergic skin rash, and asthma; 58% of the patients dropped out of the study after 26 months. Vigilance tests during the first 4 months (16 patients) showed significant improvements in all test criteria, including a shorter reaction time. All-night polygraphic electroencephalogram recordings of 14 patients on the eighth and ninth day of medication showed that average total sleep time decreased by 5.7%, but other sleep characteristics did not change significantly.", 
    "19": "An analysis has been made of the structure of a group of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) subjected to prophylactic control in a city polyclinic and the antianginal treatment performed has been assessed. Clinical examination of 85 patients with diagnosed CHD and angina pectoris (AP) and 111 patients with diagnosed CHD only, demonstrated AP in 46.7 and 35.8% of cases, respectively. 50.4% of the patients had contraindications for bicycle ergometry. An adequate treatment with propranolol, sustak (64 mg) and nitrosorbide was effected in less than 2 and 3, and in 6% of patients, respectively. Calcium antagonists in adequate doses were not used.", 
    "20": "The effect of repeated administration of desipramine (DMI) on the acquisition, performance, and extinction of a lever press response for food reward was studied. Chronic administration of DMI caused a reduction in pressing under a CRF schedule both in naive and well-trained rats. Responding during extinction sessions did not differ between saline-treated rats and rats given DMI chronically. In addition, chronic administration of DMI reduced the body weight and food intake of rats on either a free-feeding or a restricted-feeding schedule. Consequently, lever pressing was also studied in a group of rats whose body weight was regulated to match the body weight of rats were administered DMI chronically. In comparison to this control group, rats administered DMI chronically responded significantly less during both reinforcement and extinction sessions. These results fail to replicate earlier reports that chronic DMI administration produces increased resistance to extinction. The results also show that assessment of food-motivated performance in rats treated chronically with DMI is difficult because of long-term changes in body weight and food intake.", 
    "21": "The acute cardiovascular effects of oral felodipine (0.05 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg) were studied using radionuclide methods in 14 hypertensive patients. Eight were previously untreated and 6 had been treated with atenolol 100mg daily for a least 1 month. The maximal effects were observed 60 minutes after the first oral dose and no greater effect was observed with the higher dose. Felodipine caused a reduction in systemic vascular resistance, with a fall in blood pressure and an increase in cardiac output and left ventricular ejection fraction. Those responses were presumably mediated by the reduction in afterload, as they were not modified by pretreatment with atenolol. There were no changes in venous capacitance and the overall pattern of response was similar to that noted with hydralazine. Thus, in hypertensive subjects felodipine acts as a potent arteriolar vasodilator. The results suggest the drug may be an effective means of controlling hypertension, particularly when given in combination with other antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "22": "The object of the present study was to employ specific pharmacological agents and the chemical sympatholytic drug 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to characterize the neural and adrenergic control of vascular smooth muscle tone in arterioles of the hamster cheek pouch. Arteriolar diameters were measured in the superfused cheek pouch of anesthetized male golden hamsters. All orders of arterioles constricted in response to norepinephrine (10(-7) g/ml) and increased superfusion solution PO2, and dilated in response to isoproterenol (10(-7) g/ml) and adenosine (10(-4) M). Tetrodotoxin (10(-6) g/ml), phentolamine (10(-6) g/ml), and propranolol (10(-6) g/ml) had no effect upon arteriolar diameters under resting conditions. However, phentolamine and propranolol completely blocked vessel responses to norepinephrine and isoproterenol, respectively. Arterioles dilated during superfusion with either 6-OHDA (300 micrograms/ml) or its acidic vehicle. However, vessel diameters returned toward control values during the subsequent 2-hr washout period and exhibited no net dilation following recovery from 6-OHDA or its vehicle. This study suggests that neural and adrenergic mechanisms are not the primary determinants of arteriolar tone in the hamster cheek pouch.", 
    "23": "The participation of central noradrenergic neurons in the pressor responses to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of prostaglandin (PG) E2 was studied in anaesthetized rabbits. The hypertensive effect induced by i.c.v. injection of PGE2 was inhibited by i.c.v. pretreatment with 6-hydroxydopamine and phentolamine, but not propranolol. These findings suggest that the cerebral noradrenergic neurons may be involved in the development of hypertensive effect of PGE2 through the adrenergic alpha-receptors.", 
    "24": "The efficacy of labetalol, an alpha and beta receptor antagonist, was evaluated in 12 normotensive patients with stable angina pectoris in a single blind dose ranging study. After a two week period of placebo treatment, labetalol was given in doses of 100, 150, 200, and 300 mg twice daily, each for two weeks. Frequency of angina attacks decreased from 9.4 (SEM 2.3)/week in the control period to 7.3 (2.8), 5.2 (2.6), 3.8 (1.8), and 3.3 (1.9)/week in the four successive treatment periods. In the same periods the number of glyceryl trinitrate tablets consumed decreased from 7.0 (2.6)/week to 5.8 (3.3), 3.9 (2.9), 2.7 (1.8), and 2.6 (2.1)/week. Maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise tests were performed three and 12 hours after dosage at each dose. Exercise tolerance (expressed as seconds of the Bruce protocol) increased from 266 (44) with placebo to 306 (44), 369 (50), 396 (48), and 413 (51) in the four treatment periods. This improvement was accompanied by a significant blunting of the heart rate and blood pressure responses to exercise. Trough point exercise tolerance did not differ significantly from that at three hours after dosage. Thus labetalol is effective as an antianginal agent at doses of 150-300 mg twice daily and is well tolerated by the normotensive patient with angina.", 
    "25": "Phosphatidylcholine of rat brain microsomes was labeled in vivo by intracerebral injection of either [3H]oleic acid or [methyl-3H]choline chloride. These labeled microsomes served both as the enzyme source as well as a source of endogenously labeled substrate. Phospholipase D (PLD) activity was detected with these particles only in the presence of exogenous oleate, its activator. Ca2+ and the ionophore A 23187 inhibit PLD activity of oleate-labeled microsomes. In oleate-labeled particles, besides phosphatidic acid the product of PLD action radioactivity was also detected in diglyceride as a result of resident phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, which hydrolyzed the phosphatidic acid. The phosphatidate phosphohydrolase could not be completely inhibited by KF and propranolol. The release of endogenous fatty acids from labeled phospholipid by a mellitin-stimulated phospholipase A2 also present in these particulates produced minimal stimulation of endogenous PLD. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are hydrolyzed by 50% in the presence of mellitin and 90% of the radioactivity was found in the lyso-compounds. Mellitin and oleate together reduced the radioactivity found in lyso-PC and increased that in lyso-PE.", 
    "26": "The clinical interaction of 0.5% timolol maleate and 400 mg of oral caffeine on the intraocular pressure of 20 normotensive volunteers was studied. Caffeine administration did not significantly alter the reduction in intraocular pressure in timolol treated eyes. An antagonism, however, was observed in the fellow timolol untreated eyes with caffeine. The crossover reduction in intraocular pressure noted in the control group was significantly depressed in the caffeine group. A proposed mechanism for these observations is discussed.", 
    "27": "Attempt to retard growth of the eye in 4 young rabbits by means of prolonged ocular hypotony maintained by timolol-maleate were not successful. The eyes treated with 0.5 timolol twice a day showed a sustained hypotensive response of 4-5 mm Hg which lasted for the 4 months experimental period. No significant differences in size and on rate of growth in the treated and the untreated eyes were noted. In fact, over the 4 months postnatal period, both groups of eyes increased 0.5 mm per week in axial length. Our experiment suggests that in developing rabbit eyes, at least reduction of IOP is not a factor in effecting a smaller globe.", 
    "28": "The efficacy and tolerability of penbutolol alone and in combination with piretanide at two dose levels were investigated in a double-blind parallel group study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. All three treatments were given as a single daily dose. One hundred and eight patients entered the study; 82 completed a 7-day placebo run-in period followed by 3 weeks of active therapy. Penbutolol 20 mg plus piretanide 3 mg and penbutolol 40 mg plus piretanide 6 mg both produced a significantly greater reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure (16% and 19% respectively) than penbutolol 20 mg (9%). The reduction in supine diastolic blood pressure was significant for all three treatments with respects to the baseline reading. Side-effects were generally mild and transient and were similar in type and incidence in the three groups. Six patients did not complete the trial period because of an excessive response to the hypotensive medication: five in the high dose combination group, and one in the low dose combination group. Low doses of penbutolol (20 mg) and piretanide (3 mg) used in combination and in a once-daily administration provide a simple, effective and well tolerated regimen for patients with mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "29": "Adrenergic-inhibiting antihypertensive drugs, most notably the beta-blockers and alpha-agonists, have been shown to influence a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. In some instances the use of these drugs has also been reported to lead to serious psychiatric complications. Despite the clinical significance of these effects and the potential threat to treatment adherence the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This article critically evaluates the existing research in six major areas: (a) depression, (b) lethargy/fatigue, (c) cognitive and perceptual-motor performance, (d) quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) changes, (e) sleep, and (f) sexual function. In general, the evidence suggests that a pseudo-depressive state may be a relatively common side effect of treatment, and that associated changes in cognitive, affective, sleep, and sexual function may be frequently encountered.", 
    "30": "Haemodynamic effects of atenolol 50 mg, clonidine 0.15 mg, and prazosin 5 mg, given twice daily, and of the combinations atenolol + prazosin and clonidine + prazosin were studied in 8 hypertensive outpatients. Measurements were made at rest, during isometric sustained handgrip and submaximal ergometer work in mostly double-blind and cross-over fashion. Given individually atenolol and prazosin lowered resting supine blood pressure. The addition of prazosin increased the antihypertensive effects of atenolol but not of clonidine. At the end of the isometric exercise atenolol and prazosin given alone both lowered diastolic blood pressure as compared to respective pretreatment values. During handgrip prazosin contributed a little, but not much, to the antihypertensive effects of atenolol and clonidine. During dynamic exercise atenolol, clonidine, and prazosin given alone each lowered blood pressure, prazosin decreasing diastolic blood pressure in particular. Prazosin added to the antihypertensive effect of atenolol more than that of clonidine. Echocardiographic measurements revealed no significant differences between treatments at rest. During handgrip the mean velocity of left ventricular circumferential muscle fibre shortening was reduced by atenolol as compared to pretreatment values. We conclude that atenolol + prazosin may help the patients to maintain adequate haemodynamics during daily physical stresses whilst the combination prazosin + clonidine may not offer any particular advantages.", 
    "31": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effects and pharmacokinetics of bornaprolol (FM 24), a new beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, have been compared with those of propranolol and a placebo in a double-blind trial in 6 healthy volunteers. Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and peak expiratory flow rate were measured at rest and at the end of 3 min vigorous exercise on a bicycle ergometer, before and 2,24 and 48 h after single oral doses of bornaprolol (120, 240 and 480 mg) and propranolol (40, 80 and 160 mg). Plasma renin activity at rest and the plasma concentrations of the two drugs were determined. Bornaprolol significantly reduced resting heart rate, dose-dependently lowered exercise-induced tachycardia and decreased peak expiratory flow rate and plasma renin activity. In addition, exercise-induced tachycardia was significantly reduced by bornaprolol up to 48 hours after drug intake (pharmacodynamic half-life approximately 63-86 h) and there was a correlation between this reduction and the log plasma bornaprolol concentration over the 48-h period. Thus, bornaprolol behaved in man as a non-cardioselective and long-lasting beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug, probably devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.", 
    "32": "114 patients from four clinics participated in a double blind study designed to assess the efficacy of a nifedipine-acebutolol fixed combination -10 mg + 100 mg - as compared with acebutolol -200 mg- in essential hypertension. During the ten week study the mean blood pressure readings (s.d.) 1-3 h after treatment decreased from 179.2/104.8 (10.2/6.2) to 150.3/87.7 (9.8/7.7) in the combination group and from 181.7/106.5 (14.4/7.0) to 150.4/89.0 (15.0/10.4) in the acebutolol group. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also decreased after exertion (load) and 24 hours after treatment at the end of the 6th week of the study. A doubling of the dose from week 7 to 10 did not change these figures. These results reveal the possibility of treating essential hypertension with a low dose of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in combination with 10 mg nifedipine. Both drugs were well tolerated. 3 patients (5%) in the combination group and 3 patients in the acebutolol group were withdrawn from the study because of headache and dizziness.", 
    "33": "The long-term effect of timolol treatment (20 mg daily) on mortality and reinfarction was evaluated in 99 diabetic patients (placebo 46, timolol 53) surviving acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period of mean 17 months (12-33 months) there were 13 cardiac deaths in the placebo group and 5 in the timolol group, a reduction of 66.6% (p less than 0.05). The number of non-fatal reinfarctions was 10 in the placebo group and 2 in the timolol group, a reduction of 82.7% (p less than 0.05). The timolol treatment was well tolerated. However, in patients not suffering from diabetes mellitus, long-term timolol treatment was related to a slight increase in new onset diabetes mellitus and in fasting blood sugar levels.", 
    "34": "To evaluate the efficacy of acebutolol, 400-600 mg/day in elderly hypertensive patients, and to compare it with hydrochlorothiazide 25-50 mg/day, 45 patients with mild-moderate uncomplicated hypertension were treated for 6 weeks in a multicentre, single-blind, randomized, crossover trial. Acebutolol decreased supine systolic blood pressure from 186.5 to 162.7 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure from 107.4 to 92.4 mmHg. Hydrochlorothiazide decreased systolic blood pressure from 185.0 to 166.4 and diastolic blood pressure from 107.2 to 96.4. There was no difference between the effects of acebutolol and hydrochlorothiazide on blood pressure during the trial. Both drugs proved to be safe and effective antihypertensive agents, provided the major contraindications for their use were taken into account. Beta-blockade by acebutolol was highly effective in treating mild-moderate arterial hypertension in the elderly.", 
    "35": "In a randomised, double-blind, cross over trial, 25 patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were given nifedipine 20-40 mg twice daily and labetalol 200-400 mg twice daily after a 4 week period on placebo, followed by the two drugs in combination. The BP during placebo therapy was 164/108 mmHg supine and 159/110 mmHg standing. After monotherapy with nifedipine for 6 weeks the supine BP was reduced by 18/13 mmHg and the standing BP by 20/12 mmHg; with labetalol the corresponding figures were 26/15 mmHg and 28/21 mmHg, respectively. The combined therapy induced a larger fall in BP, by 36/22 mmHg supine and by 39/24 mmHg standing; in 21 of 23 patients the BP became normal. The heart rate (HR) decreased during labetalol treatment alone and on the combined therapy. With nifedipine alone, the HR was unchanged in the supine position and increased on standing. Nifedipine increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and urinary aldosterone excretion (uA), whereas labetalol reduced both. During combination therapy, PRA and uA remained unchanged. There was a slight fall in HDL-cholesterol during treatment with labetalol alone and in combination with nifedipine. The fasting blood glucose increased slightly during treatment with each of the drugs, but neither caused a change in the concentrations of glycosylated haemoglobin A1, serum insulin, C-peptide, or plasma glucagon. Adverse effects as a rule were well tolerated and were related to the pharmacological effects of the drugs. Only 2 patients left the trial, both during labetalol treatment.", 
    "36": "Ten patients who failed to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure level with dual therapy of a diuretic and a beta-blocker were allocated to captopril, nifedipine and methyldopa in random order as third-line therapy. Four patients failed to respond to any third-line agent; one patient responded to all three agents, two to nifedipine and captopril and one only to captopril. Third-line therapy is frequently ineffective and several agents may have to be tried to achieve an adequate response.", 
    "37": "In order to help define the sequential neural, humoral and metabolic responses to feeding, an experimental model involving refeeding 3-day fasted rats a single meal has been developed. The post-prandial rise in resting oxygen consumption is taken as the metabolic end-point, but unlike the response in animals fed normally, shows a marked (24 h) delay. Using a variety of pharmacological and endocrinological techniques it has been possible to show that the delay results from a complex sequence of events involving changes in blood glucose, insulin, thyroid hormones, sympathetic activity and brown fat. The possible role of the ventomedial hypothalamus in mediating some of these events is discussed and the failure of genetically obese rats to exhibit a postprandial rise in oxygen consumption is ascribed to insulin-insensitivity.", 
    "38": "Aspirin, sulfinpyrazone and the combination of aspirin/dipyridamole, which inhibit some aspects of platelet function, have been evaluated in large-scale clinical trials in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. The Persantine-Aspirin Reinfarction Study using dipyridamole, and Anturane Reinfarction Trial and Anturan Reinfarction Italian Study with sulphinpyrazone did not yield conclusive results. There have been five trials in which aspirin has been compared with a placebo. When the results were pooled, the outcome was consistent with a reduction during aspirin treatment of 5-10% in mortality and 20% in coronary event-rate. Whether this small benefit to an individual patient is worthwhile, and whether the effect of aspirin is influenced by coexistent beta-blocker treatment, is not clear.", 
    "39": "The effects on plasma lipids, blood glucose and serum insulin levels of oral administration of trimazosin and pindolol over a 6-month period were studied in 11 patients with essential hypertension. Total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations were higher (p less than 0.05) after one month's treatment with trimazosin than basal values, but the significance of changes disappeared with continuation of treatment. The concentrations of plasma triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and free fatty acids and the HDL cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio remained about constant during treatment with trimazosin. During pindolol treatment the plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were slightly but not significantly lowered at 3 and 6 months. The levels of plasma triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol remained about constant and the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol had increased slightly (p less than 0.05) at 3 months. Serum free fatty acid concentration decreased significantly. There were no significant differences between plasma lipid levels during either trimazosin or pindolol treatment. Blood glucose concentrations showed a slight tendency to increase during the treatment periods, but no impairment in insulin release was found.", 
    "40": "The antihypertensive effect and patient tolerability during 12 weeks' treatment with atenolol and bendroflumethiazide were evaluated in an open, randomized, between-patient trial. Out of a total of 162 patients, aged 50-75 years, with previously untreated hypertension, 151 completed the trial. They were randomly allocated to two groups. Forty-nine patients, aged 50-64 years (middle-aged), and 23, aged 65-75 years (elderly), were treated with atenolol. Forty middle-aged and 39 elderly were treated with bendroflumethiazide. Significant reductions in blood pressure (BP) were observed during treatment with each drug (p less than 0.001). The change in diastolic BP in middle-aged patients was significant in favour of atenolol (p less than 0.01), but otherwise no difference was found between the two drugs. Uric acid increased during treatment with both drugs (p less than 0.001). Serum potassium decreased during bendroflumethiazide treatment (p less than 0.001). Subjective side-effects of both drugs were few and expected. The results of this study indicate that atenolol and bendroflumethiazide are equally effective in reducing BP in patients aged 50-75 years.", 
    "41": "In an open, controlled trial, treatment with a combination of metoprolol and hydralazine was compared with non-pharmacological management of mild and moderate hypertension in pregnancy. One hundred and sixty-one women participated in the study. The drug-treated group showed significantly better blood pressure control than the group not given antihypertensives. Induction of labor before term, because of maternal or fetal complications, was somewhat more frequent in the control group. Nine women in the treatment group and 5 in the control group developed albuminuria. Three infants in the drug-treated group died perinatally, and one in the control group. The outcome for the newborns was similar in both groups concerning birth weight, head circumference and Apgar score and in the frequencies of respiratory distress, bradycardia and hypoglycemia. The better blood pressure control achieved with these drugs makes it possible to treat the patient at home and reduce the risk of emergency delivery, but treatment does not seem to be mandatory for a good outcome of the pregnancy in cases of mild and moderate hypertension during pregnancy.", 
    "42": "A double-blind study was carried out in two parallel groups of patients with mild to moderate hypertension to assess the efficacy and tolerance of the combination 20 mg penbutolol plus 3 mg piretanide in comparison to 40 mg penbutolol alone over a period of 6 weeks. Active drug treatment in the 51 patients studied was preceded by a 2-week period of placebo. The results showed that in both groups there was an effective reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared with initial levels. Although there was no significant difference between the groups, the normalization of diastolic blood pressure (less than 95 mmHg) was achieved in 70% of the patients receiving the combination and in 59% of the patients treated with penbutolol alone. Pulse rate decreased in both groups, body weight only in the combination group. The biochemical and haematological parameters showed no clinically relevant changes during treatment with either drug regimens. Minor side-effects definitely or probably associated with the treatment were observed in both groups but were generally mild and did not interfere with treatment. No patient withdrew prematurely from the trial.", 
    "43": "The effect of atenolol on visual reaction time was tested in 30 healthy subjects in a between-subject double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Visual reaction time was defined as the time between the display of a light signal and its extinction by the subject. Acute or chronic administration of atenolol had no effect on visual reaction time when compared with placebo.", 
    "44": "Several studies indicate that brain noradrenaline (NA) depletion facilitates the occurrence of epileptogenic syndromes in various animal models. In cobalt-induced epilepsy in the rat activity is associated with a cortical NA denervation. In order to search for cortical adrenoceptor modifications, inonophoretic studies and adrenoceptor binding assays were performed. At the period of maximal seizure activity, there was a significant supersensitivity of cortical neurons to the ionophoretic application of NA. An increase in the density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites was observed. No modification in alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor binding sites was found. This suggests that in cobalt-induced epilepsy there is a denervation supersensitivity which rests on a selective involvement of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "45": "This study was performed to re-evaluate the clinical position of prenylamine in the management of angina pectoris. After 1 week withdrawal of all anti-anginal agents, followed by another week of placebo administration, seventeen patients were allocated at random to 6 weeks treatment with either penbutolol 40 mg once a day or prenylamine 60 mg t.i.d. Clinical examination, exercise test and anginal attack rate were recorded every 2 weeks. Both drugs reduced the anginal attack rate. None of the drugs caused a significant increase in maximal workload or a significant change in ST-segment depression. Beside a substantially lower rate-pressure product at maximal comparable workload in the penbutolol group (p less than 0.001), no significant differences were observed between the two drugs. No adverse reactions were reported. From these results one can conclude that prenylamine and penbutolol do not differ in their anti-anginal effect. Therefore we are of the opinion that prenylamine has a place in the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of angina pectoris, particularly in patients where beta-blocking agents are contraindicated or in patients who have experienced side-effects of beta-blocking or calcium-entry blocking agents.", 
    "46": "After screening two local populations in the northern part of The Netherlands for hypertension, patients with a diastolic pressure (DP) between 95 and 120 mmHg were treated daily either with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 100 mg atenolol. Nonresponders were given the combination and if necessary the dose of atenolol was increased to 200 mg. Non-responders to the latter combination were randomized and treated either with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and labetalol or with 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, 200 mg atenolol and prazosin. If after 1 month a DP less than or equal to 90 mmHg had been reached the patient was reassessed after a further 3 months. If a DP greater than 90 mmHg was found the dose of labetalol or prazosin was increased and the patient was re-examined after 1 month. This protocol was followed until the maximum dose was reached or adverse reactions prevented a further increase in dosage. During 6 months of treatment there was a further drop in systolic and diastolic blood pressures under both regimens of, respectively, 8.6 and 2.4 mmHg for labetalol, and 7.7 and 5.0 mmHg for the prazosin group. At the end of the period the average daily doses of labetalol and prazosin were 1256 mg and 4.3 mg, respectively. There was no significant difference in the average number of complaints between the labetalol and the prazosin group.", 
    "47": "The effect of indenolol on heart rate and blood pressure at rest and after submaximal workload has been studied in 19 patients with established essential hypertension. A stepwise increase from moderate to submaximal exercise was chosen to mimic challenges normally occurring in daily life. After 4 weeks of once a day indenolol therapy a significant, gradual reduction in the following cardiovascular parameters was observed: heart rate at rest fell by 20%, 30% after exercise and 31% after recovery; systolic blood pressure showed a fall of 15% at rest, 19% after workload and 14% after recovery; the reduction in diastolic blood pressure was 15% at rest, 11% after exercise and 12% after recovery. The rate-pressure product was decreased by 32% at rest, 43% after exercise and 42% after recovery. It is concluded that the most important pharmacological effect of indenolol is the significant decrease in myocardial oxygen demand. In patients with essential hypertension indenolol not only produces a definite antihypertensive effect, but it also increases workload tolerance and decreases subjective symptoms during physical activity. Compliance was good and no severe side effects were observed.", 
    "48": "The treatments of mild hypertension with atenolol and prazosin in occupationally active men and women were compared in a double blind cross-over with placebo. The hypotensive effect of the beta-adreno-receptor blocking drug, atenolol, were striking and in accordance with current knowledge, using one daily dose of 100 mg. In contrast, the hypotensive effect of taking 2 mg prazosin twice a day was modest, averaging about 3% when compared with placebo, somewhat less but still detectable during the performance of muscular exercises. Atenolol medication significantly reduced heart rate and blood pressure responses to muscular exercises, covering a range of work loads experienced during ordinary working days. No increased feeling of muscular fatigue or other discomfort during muscular work compared to that on prazosin and placebo medication could be detected. It was therefore concluded that atenolol medication was a useful treatment of mild hypertension and did not reduce the normal working ability and exercise tolerance. Prazosin medication did not significantly change working ability and exercise tolerance.", 
    "49": "The response of plasma renin activity (PRA) to stepwise reductions in renal arterial pressure (RAP) induced by suprarenal aortic constriction (SAC) or hydralazine (0.1-30 mg/kg i.v.), and the effect of indomethacin (5 mg/kg i.v.) or propranolol (1.5 mg/kg) s.c.) on the PRA response were examined in anesthetized rats whose right kidneys had been removed 6-7 days earlier. The stepwise reduction of RAP by SAC or hydralazine produced a steep increase in PRA when RAP was below approximately 100 mm Hg. Above this level, PRA was unaffected by changes in RAP. The SAC-induced increase in PRA was nearly abolished by indomethacin. On the other hand, propranolol failed to affect the SAC-induced increase in PRA. The hydralazine-induced renin release was remarkably suppressed by either indomethacin Or propranolol. These results suggest that SAC-induced renin release is mainly dependent on the prostaglandin system, whereas hydralazine-induced renin release is dependent on the prostaglandin and the adrenergic nervous system. We estimated the threshold pressure for increasing renin release is approximately 100 mm Hg.", 
    "50": "The authors review the available literature on the use of propranolol in the treatment of anxiety disorders. First studied in 1966, propranolol has been shown to be most effective in the control of certain somatic symptoms associated with anxiety. Despite these studies, however, it is still not certain where this beta-adrenergic blocker fits into the overall treatment of anxiety disorders. Reasons for this uncertainty and other related problems are discussed.", 
    "51": "The various mechanisms which have been advanced to explain drug absorption are critically reviewed and the limitations of current theories are discussed. Various techniques for investigating drug absorption and transit through the gut are presented, and the results obtained with metoprolol are briefly considered to illustrate the potential of some of these methods.", 
    "52": "In a controlled double-blind study the effect of muzolimine (20 mg o.d.) and acebutolol (400 mg o.d.) were investigated in outpatients suffering from moderate essential hypertension. After a three week placebo run-in period, 49 patients were recruited and followed by a cooperative group of general practitioners over a period of 3 months. Blood pressure decreased to the same extent in both groups. With regard to clinical and biological tolerance, no differences appeared between the two drugs.", 
    "53": "In order to investigate comparatively the effects of prazosin and atenolol on plasma lipid concentrations, 60 patients from two centres, presenting with arterial hypertension (diastolic 90-120 mmHg, systolic 160-200 mmHg), were allocated at random to one or the other of these drugs. The lipid profile, stable during the period of observation, included total cholesterol and triglycerides, study by ultracentrifugation, and assays of apoproteins A1 and B by laser immunonephelometry. Determinations were performed 30 days before, and on the 1st, 90 th and 180 th days of treatment. Both drugs had similar lowering effects on blood pressure. A significant decrease in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B and an increase in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 were observed in patients under prazosin, whereas patients under atenolol exhibited opposite variations in plasma lipids. Although the clinical significance of these findings is uncertain, such metabolic effects should be taken into account when evaluating the risk/benefit ratio of antihypertensive treatments.", 
    "54": "A double-blind trial with the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol in suspected acute myocardial infarction and during 3 months' follow-up included 1395 patients, aged 40-74 years, 698 on metoprolol and 697 on placebo. In order to further evaluate the tolerability to beta-blockade in the elderly, the total series was divided into 2 groups according to median age (61 years) and into quartiles, the lowest quartile (40-57 years) being compared with the highest (67-74 years). The decrease in heart rate and systolic blood pressure after intravenous metoprolol in the acute phase was similar in the elderly and the younger patients. Hypotension was observed more often in the metoprolol-treated than in the placebo-treated younger patients, while no difference was observed in the elderly. Bradycardia was observed more often in the metoprolol group in both age groups, while there was no difference regarding the incidence of congestive heart failure in either the younger or in the elderly patients. The effect on mortality, serious ventricular arrhythmias and chest pain seemed to be similar in different age groups. From the present series we conclude that hemodynamic reactions and tolerability to beta-blockade can be expected to be similar in elderly and younger patients.", 
    "55": "Fifty patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension were randomized (double-blindly) to treatment with either captopril (n = 26) or atenolol (n = 24). Their mean supine diastolic blood pressure after placebo was 100-125 mmHg. The study included an initial dose finding phase (12 weeks) during which the dosages of captopril and atenolol were increased stepwise every second week in order to obtain normotension (supine diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mmHg). Hydrochlorothiazide was added when necessary. During the second phase of the study the patients were followed on active treatment for 2 years. After the initial 12 weeks of active treatment, recumbent and standing blood pressures had fallen significantly both in the captopril group (by 31/20 and 33/19 mmHg, p less than 0.001) and in the atenolol group (by 24/18 and 30/20 mmHg, p less than 0.01 (systolic), p less than 0.001 (diastolic)). The antihypertensive effect was maintained in both groups during long-term treatment. The antihypertensive effect of both agents was potentiated to the same extent by addition of hydrochlorothiazide. Side-effects were few and mild. It can be concluded that both captopril and atenolol are safe and effective antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "56": "The effect of the combined therapy of d-propranolol and captopril was evaluated in post-ischaemic acute renal failure in rats. The glomerular filtration rate measured 24 hours after ischaemic insult in the animals receiving no drugs was 54 +/- 11 microliter/min/100g body weight while in animals treated with the combination of d-propranolol and captopril it was 305 +/- 35 microliter/min/100g body weight (p less than 0.05). The precise mechanism of protection afforded by the combination therapy is not clear, but this approach could be useful in protecting the kidney from ischaemic damage.", 
    "57": "The antihypertensive efficacy of a new long-lasting vasodilator, cadralazine, and the diuretic chlorthalidone have been compared in hypertensive patients receiving concurrent treatment with atenolol. After a 4-week run-in period with atenolol alone 100 mg/day, two groups of 10 patients whose diastolic blood pressure exceeded 100 mm Hg were given for a period of 65 days either cadralazine 15 mg/day or chlorthalidone 25 mg/day, according to a randomized, double-blind, between-patients design. Compared to atenolol alone, both cadralazine and chlorthalidone induced a statistically and clinically significant decrease in blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect did not differ significantly between groups. Good compensation of the atenolol-induced decrease in heart rate was obtained with cadralazine, whereas during atenolol + chlorthalidone treatment at times the standing heart rate was significantly lower than during treatment with atenolol + cadralazine. Side-effects, many of which were already present during atenolol treatment, occurred with a similar frequency in both groups. It is concluded that atenolol + cadralazine and atenolol + chlorthalidone are equally well tolerated, acceptable and effective in the treatment of hypertension, but that further studies are warranted to explore the potential haemodynamic advantages of the cadralazine + atenolol combination.", 
    "58": "116 patients from 4 clinics participated in a double blind study to assess the efficacy of (BAY l 5240), a nifedipine-acebutolol fixed combination (10 mg + 100 mg), as compared to nifedipine 20 mg in essential hypertension. During the 10 week study, the mean recumbent blood pressure decreased 1 to 3 h after treatment from 175.5/105.2 to 148.3/88.0 mmHg in the BAY l 5240 group and from 174.3/102.9 to 150.3/86.5 mmHg in the nifedipine group. The results also showed a comparable decrease in the mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures before treatment (24 h after last tablet) and after physical exertion before and after either drug given for 4 weeks. Doubling of the dose for 4 additional weeks produced a moderate and similar additional decrease in blood pressure. The results show the possibility of treating essential hypertension with a low dose of a beta-adrenergic blocking agent in combination with 10 mg nifedipine. Both regimens were well tolerated. One patient in the BAY l 5240 group and 2 in the nifedipine group, all treated by the same investigator, were withdrawn from the study because of headache during the nifedipine pre-period.", 
    "59": "An open, co-operative study was carried out in 227 patients with mild to severe essential hypertension to assess the efficacy and tolerance of penbutolol, given as monotherapy, in controlling blood pressure. Patients received a single daily dose (40 mg in the majority) for 8 weeks and were assessed every 2 weeks. The results showed that there was a significant reduction (p less than 0.01) in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure and in pulse rate after 2 weeks compared with pre-treatment values, and there was a further significant reduction (p less than 0.01) comparing 8-week values with those measured after 2 weeks. Response to treatment did not differ significantly between those patients who were newly diagnosed and those who had received previous antihypertensive medication. The largest percentage reduction in blood pressure from initial values was recorded in those patients with the more severe hypertension (diastolic 116 to 130 mmHg) and a considerable number of all the patients became normotensive during the trial period. Records of side-effects indicated a global incidence of 17.6%, the most frequently reported being dizziness and mild gastro-intestinal disorders; only 1 patient complained of bradycardia and another of cold extremities. Eighteen (7.9%) patients dropped out of the study due to side-effects.", 
    "60": "In a double-blind, crossover study in 100 elderly hypertensive patients, the hypotensive effect of a fixed combination of atenolol (50 mg) with chlorthalidone (12.5 mg) was compared with that of each of its component drugs given alone. Patients were allocated at random into two groups: one group received treatment for 4 weeks with either the combination or atenolol alone before being crossed over to the alternative medication for a further 4 weeks; the other group received either the combination or chlorthalidone alone and followed the same treatment pattern. Dosage was a single tablet per day given in the morning. Blood pressure and pulse rate were measured approximately 24 hours after dosing at the end of each treatment period. The results showed that significantly lower blood pressures were achieved, both in the standing and lying positions, with the combination than with either atenolol or chlorthalidone used alone. Combination treatment was well tolerated, few side-effects being reported and there was no significant disturbance of plasma electrolytes.", 
    "61": "Patients with cirrhosis, who have survived an episode of variceal bleeding, often have far-advanced liver disease and therefore, on average, a severely restricted life expectancy. Still, the prognosis for the individual patient varies greatly depending on the presence or absence of large varices and the Child classification. Centres evaluating treatment of variceal bleeding often attract different patient populations. Comparison of the outcome of the complete series of patients is usually meaningless since results reflect the composition of the patient population rather than the applied therapy. The natural history of patients with variceal bleeding should be defined by Child category, allowing more precise definition of the therapeutic aims and subsequently assessment of the results. Persistent lowering of the portal pressure by pharmacological modulation of the portal haemodynamic system is now feasible due to the availability of long-acting oral medication. Propranolol is still the leading drug and, in one centre, its use in predominantly Child A patients was associated with a marked reduction in recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequently mortality rate. These results could not be reproduced in another centre. Both the restricted indication as well as the uncertain efficacy limit the current use of propranolol, but further pharmacological developments are bound to appear. Endoscopic sclerotherapy has become the treatment of choice in the prevention of recurrent variceal haemorrhage. The proponents of paravasal injection report excellent efficacy in combination with a low incidence of side-effects, whereas mainly theoretical reasons are advanced by users of intravariceal injections. Still, variceal haemorrhage remains an important clinical problem in the period between the start of sclerotherapy and the eradication of varices. Combination of sclerotherapy with portal antihypertensive medication might become the treatment of choice until eradication of varices has been achieved; thereafter either continued medication or repeated endoscopy will maintain an avariceal state and effective prevention of recurrent variceal bleeding.", 
    "62": "Vasodilators were characterized on the basis of their first-dose effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, on the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure and on plasma renin activity (PRA) in conscious normotensive dogs. The compounds were given orally to the animals and the effects were studied over a period of 4 h. The arterial vasodilators (propyldazine, dihydralazine and labetalol) caused a marked reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with excessive stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to an increase in myocardial oxygen demand. The blood pressure effect of urapidil and prazosin resembled more the pattern seen with typical venous dilators (molsidomine and nitrates) and was not accompanied by significant increases in heart rate and in PRA. Hence, the magnitude of diastolic blood pressure reduction seems to be an essential determinant of reflex counterregulation. The results prove that some few parameters can give information about the overall pattern of hemodynamic effects of vasodilators.", 
    "63": "The effect of metoprolol on platelet aggregation was investigated in a group of postmyocardial infarction (MI) patients. The study was double-blind and included 63 subjects; 30 patients were maintained on metoprolol and 33 received placebo treatment. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation was carried out in each subject close to 4 weeks after the acute MI. It was demonstrated that metoprolol as compared to placebo did not influence ADP-induced platelet aggregation in the present clinical setting.", 
    "64": "During treatment with amiodarone, digoxin and nadolol, asystole occurred repeatedly in a patient with chronic persistent automatic atrial tachycardia. Asystole did not occur after discontinuation of drug therapy, and rechallenge with amiodarone alone produced marked overdrive suppression of all pacemakers resulting in asystole. Amiodarone serum level was within therapeutic range. The possible electrophysiologic mechanisms by which amiodarone might suppress both normal and abnormal pacemakers are discussed. The occurrence of asystole at therapeutic serum concentration of amiodarone suggests that this drug should be used with caution.", 
    "65": "Theoretical models of oxygen transport in the myocardium have failed to account for low average tissue pO2 relative to to coronary sinus pO2, measured with pO2 electrodes and myoglobin saturation, and for hypoxic contractile failure at relatively high coronary sinus pO2 levels. These findings could be explained by either arteriovenous diffusional shunting or a limiting rate of transfer of oxygen from blood to tissue, or both. To gain new insights, we performed multiple indicator dilution tracer experiments across the coronary circulation in the dog, with 18O2 as the oxygen tracer and 51Cr-labeled red cells as the reference tracer for oxygen. 125I-Albumin and 22Na+ were included to provide the relative plasma flow rate. The tracer oxygen outflow curve consisted of a large early peak related to its reference red cell curve. No tracer emerged before the labeled red cells. The downslope, which contains the returning component of the tracer curve, decreased less steeply when oxygen consumption was reduced by propranolol. Fitting the tracer oxygen outflow curve with a distributed model including irreversible sequestration behind a resistance gave a transfer rate constant which was relatively small, and a relatively large rate constant for sequestration. Relative oxygen consumption (estimated from the arteriovenous difference) correlated closely with the rate constant for sequestration. Estimated average tissue oxygen concentrations were of the order of one-third blood concentration. Dimensional analysis indicates that the low transfer rate constant derives from hemoglobin-oxygen binding; this decreases fractional tracer oxygen transfer in proportion to the ratio of plasma:red cell oxygen pools.", 
    "66": "The effects of a combined alpha and beta receptor antagonist, labetalol, were investigated in 10 patients with chronic stable angina pectoris. The optimal dose was determined during an initial dose titration study when the patients were treated with 200 mg, 400 mg, and 600 mg (six patients) of labetalol a day. The effective dose was then compared with placebo in a double blind randomised study. The effects of the drug were monitored with angina diaries, treadmill exercise testing, and 48 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic ST segment monitoring. Plasma labetalol concentrations were measured during each treatment period. The mean effective antianginal dose of labetalol was 480 (SD 140) mg/day given by mouth twice a day. There was a dose related reduction in daytime and nocturnal heart rate, the frequency of pain was significantly reduced by 41%, and exercise duration was significantly increased by 44% with labetalol when compared with placebo. The frequency and duration of the episodes of ST segment depression were significantly reduced by 56% and 73% respectively with labetalol. Adverse effects resulted in a reduction of the dose of labetalol in two patients. Thus labetalol is an effective agent in the treatment of angina pectoris.", 
    "67": "The antianginal effects of diltiazem 180 mg/day and propranolol 240 mg/day, alone and in combination, were investigated in 15 patients with effort related angina in a double blind placebo controlled crossover trial, with each period of treatment lasting four weeks. Patients performed a symptom limited treadmill exercise test at the end of each period of treatment. Mean (SEM) time to onset of angina was increased from 293(32) s when receiving placebo to 347(38) s when receiving diltiazem alone, to 350(30) s when receiving propranolol alone, and further to 421(34) s when receiving diltiazem and propranolol combined. Similar changes occurred in the duration of exercise testing and time to 1 mm ST segment depression. The sum of ST segment depression at peak exercise was reduced by both diltiazem and propranolol alone compared with placebo, and combination treatment produced a further significant improvement. Rate pressure product was significantly reduced at rest and at peak exercise after propranolol alone and combination treatment. The study clearly showed the superior value of diltiazem and propranolol combined in effort related angina when compared with either drug used alone.", 
    "68": "We studied chronic oral propranolol therapy and placebo in seven patients with essential voice tremor. Mean scores for voice tremor and voice quality did not differ for placebo or propranolol. Hand tremor amplitude decreased significantly with propranolol. Voice tremor seems to be more resistant to propranolol therapy than hand tremor.", 
    "69": "Rat pancreatic islets methylate phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids to form phosphatidylcholine (PC) with S-adenosyl-L-[methy-3H]methionine as the methyl donor. Islet PE-N-methyltransferase had activity optima at pH 6-7 and 8-9. S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine, sodium deoxycholate, and Triton X-100 inhibited methylation in islet homogenates. Addition of phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine and phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine (PDME) enhanced [3H]methyl incorporation into PDME and PC, respectively. Isoproterenol, but not glucose, stimulated phospholipid methylation in islet homogenates. Propranolol inhibited the isoproterenol effect. In intact islets, glucose or isoproterenol stimulated insulin release and incorporation of [3H]methyl groups from [methyl-3H]methionine into phospholipids. Isoproterenol enhanced to a similar extent glucose-stimulated methylation and hormone release. Neither 2-deoxyglucose, tolbutamide, nor 8-bromo-cyclic AMP stimulated islet phospholipid methylation. The methyl-transferase inhibitor 3-deazaadenosine inhibited both glucose and isoproterenol-stimulated methyltransferase activity and insulin release. Propranolol inhibited the beta-adrenergic potentiation of glucose-induced phospholipid methylation and insulin release. These data suggest that PE-N-methyltransferase plays a role in amplification of the islet cell stimulus-secretion coupling response to certain secretagogues.", 
    "70": "Gastric intubation with 40 kJ of a carbohydrate slurry (4 mL) produced increases in resting oxygen consumption (VO2) of 15% to 22% in control, cold-adapted, and hyperthyroid rats, but the absolute rise in metabolic rate after food was greater in the latter group. Tube-feeding methyl cellulose (4 mL, 7% wt/vol) evoked similar increases in VO2 to carbohydrate (15% to 23%), but all of these responses were inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol. In cold-adapted animals, fat (40 kJ, 1.2 mL) produced a greater thermic effect than carbohydrate or methyl cellulose, and water (4 mL) also induced a small (8%), significant increase in VO2. Treatment with diazoxide shortly before the meal, to inhibit insulin release, almost completely inhibited the thermic responses to carbohydrate and methyl cellulose in all groups, but did not alter the effects of fat or water. Ingestion of a nonmetabolizable substance (methyl cellulose), would appear to stimulate metabolic rate to a similar extent to carbohydrate, possibly by causing gastric distention. Thermic effects of both these substances appear to involve insulin release and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The thermic response to fat can also be inhibited by beta-adrenergic blockade, but apparently does not involve insulin release.", 
    "71": "Since their introduction in the United States about 4 years ago, the calcium antagonists have achieved an important place in the medical therapy of several cardiovascular disease entities. These pharmacologic agents differ markedly in their clinical utility. Verapamil is extremely effective in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and the various anginal syndromes, but it appears to be ineffective or possibly even deleterious in those with pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure of any cause, and Raynaud's phenomenon or disease. Nifedipine exerts a powerful vasodilatory effect and, as a result, is efficacious in individuals with systemic or pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and Raynaud's phenomenon or disease. It is also beneficial in patients with various kinds of angina, especially when it is administered concomitantly with a beta-adrenergic blocker. It is totally ineffective as an antiarrhythmic agent. Diltiazem is an effective antianginal agent and may be beneficial as an antiarrhythmic agent, but it is largely untested in patients with systemic or pulmonary hypertension, Raynaud's disease, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A thorough understanding of each drug's hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects allows the practicing physician to prescribe them skillfully and safely.", 
    "72": "To evaluate the role of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on lower limb circulation in patients with peripheral arterial disease, heart rate, blood pressure, calf blood flow and vascular resistance were measured at rest and during reactive hyperemia in seven patients with hypertension and intermittent claudication. The study was performed as a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of 10 days with doses of propranolol, 80 mg twice a day, pindolol, 5 mg twice a day, labetalol, 200 mg twice a day, and labetalol, 400 mg twice a day as active drug. Heart rate was lowest during propranolol dosing and blood pressure was lowest during labetalol dosing irrespective of the labetalol dose used. The degree of peripheral arterial disease modulated the effect of beta-blockade on limb circulation. In the less symptomatic limbs, reactive hyperemic flow was greater after pindolol than after the other drugs and did not differ from the level recorded after placebo. These differences were inconsistent and small in the more symptomatic limbs. Thus as the peripheral arterial disease became more severe and extensive, beta-blockade, irrespective of its type, lost its hemodynamic effect on lower limb circulation.", 
    "73": "The ocular metabolism of timolol has been studied in the iris/ciliary body, vitreous humor, neuro-retina and cornea from an albino rabbit, pigmented rabbit and cynomolgus monkey by incubating tissues isolated from these animals with radiolabeled drug for 20 hours at 37 degrees C in Hanks' balanced salts solution. After removal of the tissues by centrifugation and subsequent deproteinization, supernatants were mixed with unlabeled timolol and analyzed by isocratic reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with liquid scintillation counting and ultraviolet detection. Although this analytical system readily demonstrated the production of timolol metabolites by rat liver, the production of timolol metabolites by ocular tissues could not be demonstrated. With most samples high recoveries of unmetabolized timolol were obtained. The lowest level of recovery of unmetabolized drug as compared to a control (drug added after the tissue had been incubated) was obtained for the iris/ciliary body from the pigmented rabbit suggesting that pigment had bound the drug. Our results suggest that deleterious side effects sometimes seen with the drug or its lack of efficacy with rabbits is not due to ocular metabolism by these tissues.", 
    "74": "The effects of antiglaucoma drugs on [32P]-orthophosphate incorporation into phospholipids of iris and ciliary process were investigated. Both iris and ciliary process rapidly incorporated 32Pi into the major phospholipids, with the acidic phosphoinositides demonstrating a greater labelling than phosphatidylcholine, indicating a greater turnover. The muscarinic agonists, carbachol and pilocarpine, stimulated 32Pi-labelling of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidic acid (PA) in both iris and ciliary process. These effects were blocked by atropine, suggesting that the response was mediated through muscarinic receptors. The beta blocking ocular hypotensive drugs, propranolol, timolol and atenolol, produced varying effects on 32P incorporation into phospholipids of iris and ciliary process. Propranolol stimulated 32Pi-labelling into phosphatidylinositol 4', 5' bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 4' phosphate (PIP), PI and PA. Timolol decreased 32Pi-incorporation into PIP2 and PI, whereas atenolol, a selective beta 1 antagonist, had no significant effect on 32Pi-labelling of phospholipids. The above findings on propranolol agree with previous observations which demonstrated that propranolol redirects glycerolipid metabolism through multiple effects on the enzymes in phospholipid biosynthesis, particularly in stimulating phosphatidylinositol kinases. The results with timolol suggest that this drug may decrease phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The effects of these ocular hypotensive, non-selective beta blocking drugs on phospholipid turnover may ultimately limit the accumulation of breakdown products which could serve as cellular messengers.", 
    "75": "Symptoms and findings arising from the systemic beta blockade caused by topical ocularly applied timolol appear shortly after drug application. We studied the systemic absorption of 20 microliters of 0.5% timolol instilled unilaterally in the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac in 6 volunteers. At 3 min one subject, at 5 min three and at 8 min all but one showed measurable (greater than or equal to 215 pg/ml) timolol concentrations in the plasma. The rapid systemic absorption of topically applied ocular timolol observed in our study is consistent with the rapid appearance of the cardiovascular and pulmonary side effects reported in connection with timolol eye drop therapy.", 
    "76": "Twenty patients with essential hypertension were given 400 mg acebutolol once daily for 24 weeks. In order to study if side effects resembling the \"Practolol syndrome\" developed, ocular effects were sought and antinuclear antibody (ANA) in blood was assessed before and after treatment. ANA was negative both before and after the study in 17 patients; in one patient ANA was positive, but the titre (1:10) was low and did not change during the study. Acebutolol produced no undesirable effects on cornea, conjunctiva or lens. During acebutolol treatment, tear secretion was reduced but tear lysozyme concentration was not significantly altered. Overall, acebutolol had no undesirable action similar to the practolol-induced syndrome, nor did it cause such common clinical ocular symptoms such as dry or gritty eyes.", 
    "77": "In patients with cirrhosis, superior portosystemic collateral circulation was evaluated by the continuous thermodilution method in the azygos vein. Azygos blood flow was 5 times higher in a group of patients with cirrhosis (alcoholic in 27, cryptogenic in 8, post-hepatitic in 2 and primary biliary cirrhosis in 1), than in a group of patients without portal hypertension (steatosis in 2, granulomatous hepatitis in 2, persistent chronic hepatitis in 2 and Hodgkin's disease in 1). Azygos blood flow was not different in cirrhotic patients with no visible, in those with small-sized, and in those with large sized oesophageal varices. Azygos blood flow was not different in cirrhotic patients with and without a previous episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. Fifteen min after intravenous administration of 15 mg of propranolol, azygos blood flow significantly decreased whereas azygos blood flow did not change after placebo. The decrease in azygos blood flow was significantly more marked than the reduction in cardiac output. It is concluded that superior portosystemic collateral blood flow is elevated in patients with cirrhosis and that the reduction in this collateral circulation might explain the efficiency of propranolol in the prevention of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.", 
    "78": "SK&F 38393A (DAA) dose-dependently decreased the contractility of isolated frog hearts with an ED50 of 6.60 +/- 0.28 X 10(-5) M, while, dopamine (DA) elicited a dose-dependent increase in the contractility of the preparation with an ED50 of 5.13 +/- 0.36 X 10(-5) M. The results of in situ investigation, using cardiac output as the index of cardiac contractility, were in agreement with the in vitro results. Haloperidol (10(-6) M), a dopaminergic receptor blocker, did not block the cardiovascular effects of DAA and DA. However, propranolol (10(-8) M), a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, prevented the positive inotropic effects of DA but had no effects on the negative inotropic effects of DAA. The results suggest that DAA might be acting on this preparation through a mechanism which is probably not associated with beta-adrenergic and/or dopaminergic receptors."
