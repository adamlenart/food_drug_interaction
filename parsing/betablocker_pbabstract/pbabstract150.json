Simvastatin belongs to the statin family used to lower blood cholesterol. Drug interaction between erlotinib and statin has not been reported before. Both drugs are major substrates of the CYP3A4 enzyme in the liver. Thus, co-administration of these drugs can increase their serum levels, potentially leading to adverse effects. We report the interaction between erlotinib and simvastatin leading to rhabdomyolysis. Thus, caution is required with increasing usage of both of these drugs.", 
    "1": "The objective was to investigate the feasibility of using a miniaturized disk intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) apparatus to determine the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) solubility class, and to develop an approach where IDR measurements performed in media of different buffer capacity could be compared.", 
    "2": "The disk IDR values of 14 model drugs were determined at 37 degrees C in US Pharmacopeia buffers at pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8. As little as 5 mg of drug were compressed in a die, with surface area of 0.071 cm(2), with the die assembly rotated at 100 rpm in 10 mL media. Drug concentration was measured by an in situ fiber optic ultraviolet method. The solubilities and pK(a)s were determined, and used to simulate dissolution profiles with a convective-diffusion-with-chemical-reaction model.", 
    "3": "The disk IDR values spanned six orders of magnitude (0.00014 to 114 mg min(-1) cm(-2)). The comparison of the miniaturized disk IDR values to published results using traditional dissolution bath apparatus indicated r (2) = 0.99.", 
    "4": "The results demonstrate that using 100-fold less drug does not sacrifice the quality of the measurement, and lends support to an earlier study Yu et al. (Int. J.

    "6": "We recruited 187 AMI patients receiving metoprolol on clinical grounds and genotyped them for CYP2D6 *3, *4, *10, and gene duplication. Heart rates (HR) at admission and discharge were registered. Clinical details were derived from the case histories. Metoprolol and alpha-hydroxy-metoprolol were analyzed by HPLC in plasma before and after 2, 6 and 12 h post dose in the first 115 patients. HR at rest was registered after each sampling. Ventricular rhythm disturbance (VRD) association with CYP2D6 activity, found accidentally, was studied in a newly formed subgroup (n = 23).", 
    "7": "Metoprolol represented 85% of all beta-blocker prescriptions. CYP2D6 genotype distribution was comparable with other Caucasian populations. Genotypically poor metabolizers (PM, n = 2) exhibited the most pronounced bradycardia at discharge, while in the ultrarapid metabolizers (UM, n = 7) therapeutic effect was not achieved. Metoprolol and alpha-hydroxy-metoprolol plasma concentration AUCs differed significantly between the genotypes corresponding to predicted metabolic activity (P < 0.005). Correspondingly, the mean HRs were lower in PMs and increased with increasing number of active CYP2D6 genes (P < 0.05). Trough metoprolol concentrations were only quantifiable in patients with at least one mutated allele. Neither decreased cardiac ejection fraction nor age and gender influenced metoprolol disposition. Higher mean number of active CYP2D6 genes was found in patients with VRDs (2.2 vs. 1.7), which could not be clearly explained by metoprolol concentrations. CYP2D6 gene duplication was overrepresented in this group (22 vs. 2%, P = 0.0002).", 
    "8": "Metoprolol disposition and effects are mainly controlled by CYP2D6 genotype. Patients with gene duplication are at high risk of not benefiting from treatment due to lower metoprolol concentrations. Higher CYP2D6 activity seems to be associated with VRDs complicating AMI, being a negative prognostic factor for patients' survival.", 
    "9": "It is suggested here that liquisolid technique has the potential to be optimized for the reduction of drug dissolution rate and thereby production of sustained release systems. In the present study, propranolol hydrochloride was dispersed in polysorbate 80 as the liquid vehicle. Then a binary mixture of carrier-coating materials (Eudragit RL or RS as the carrier and silica as the coating material) was added to the liquid medication under continuous mixing in a mortar. The final mixture was compressed using the manual tableting machine. The effect of drug concentration, loading factor, thermal treating and aging on release profile of propranolol hydrochloride from liquisolid compacts were investigated at two pH values (1.2 and 6.8). The release rate of propranolol HCl from liquisolid compacts was compared to the release of propranolol HCl from conventional tablets. X-ray crystallography and DSC were used to investigate the formation of any complex between drug and excipients or any crystallinity changes during the manufacturing process. Propranolol HCl tablets prepared by liquisolid technique showed greater retardation properties in comparison with conventional matrix tablets. This investigation provided evidence that polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) has important role in sustaining the release of drug from liquisolid matrices, and a reduction of T(g) of the polymer can be the reason for the release prolongation of liquisolid tablets. The results also showed that wet granulation had remarkable impact on release rate of propranolol HCl from liquisolid compacts, reducing the release rate of drug from liquisolid compacts. The results showed that aging (liquisolid tablets were kept at 25 degrees C/75% relative humidity for 6 months) had no effect on hardness and dissolution profile of drug. The kinetics studies revealed that most of the liquisolid formulations followed the zero-order release pattern. X-ray crystallography and DSC ruled out any changes in crystallinity or complex formation during the manufacturing process of liquisolid formulations.",

    "12": "Between 1994 and 2007, 181 consecutive patients (age, 42+/-15 years) with clinically suspected viral myocarditis were enrolled and followed up for a mean of 59+/-42 months. Endomyocardial biopsies were studied for inflammation with histological (Dallas) and immunohistological criteria. Virus genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction. The primary end point was time to cardiac death or heart transplantation. In 38% of the patients (n=69), the Dallas criteria were positive. Immunohistological signs of inflammation were shown in 50% (n=91). Genomes of cardiotropic virus species were detected in 79 patients (44%). During follow-up, 22% of the patients (n=40) reached the primary end point. Three independent predictors were identified for the primary end point, namely New York Heart Association class III or IV at entry (hazard ratio, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.36 to 7.57; P=0.008), immunohistological evidence of inflammatory infiltrates in the myocardium (hazard ratio, 3.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.39 to 8.62; P=0.008), and beta-blocker therapy (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.21 to 0.91; P=0.027). Ejection fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension index were predictive only in univariate, not in multivariate, analysis. Neither the Dallas criteria nor the detection of viral genome was a predictor of outcome.",

    "14": "The aim of this study was to verify whether exaggerated arrhythmogenesis is attributed to inflammatory factors actively involving an excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and endothelin (ET). We hypothesized that CPU86017, derived from berberine, which possesses multi-channel blocking activity, could suppress inflammatory factors, resulting in inhibition of over-expression of ether-a-go-go (ERG) and an augmented incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R). Rats with cardiomyopathy (CMP) induced by thyroxine (0.2 mg(-1)kg(-1) s.c. daily for 10 days) were treated with propranolol (10 mgkg(-1) p.o.) or CPU86017 (80 mgkg(-1) p.o.) on days 6-10. On the 11th day, arrhythmogenesis of the CMP was evaluated by I/R. In the CMP control group, an increase in VF incidence was found with the I/R episode, accompanied by increased ROS, which manifested as an increased level of malondialdehyde and decreased activities of SOD, glutathione peroxidase and catalase in the myocardium. Levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and TGF-beta mRNA were increased in association with upregulation of preproET-1 and ET-converting enzyme. We found increased levels of ERG, which correlated well with arrhythmogenesis. Treatment with CPU86017 or propranolol reversed these changes. These experiments verified our hypothesis that the inflammatory factors ROS, iNOS, TGF-beta and ET-1 are actively involved in upregulation of ERG and arrhythmogenesis. CPU86017 and propranolol reduced VF by suppressing these inflammatory factors in the myocardium.",

In immobilized awake rats, the temporal and geometrical parameters varied similarly, while spectral analysis indicated possible activation of other neurohumoral mechanisms against the background of beta-blocker treatment.", 
    "16": "A fatal case of intentional poisoning with two antiarrhythmic agents, pilsicainide, a pure sodium channel blocker, and atenolol, a selective beta1 blocker, is presented. A woman in her twenties was found dead at home and empty pill packages of pilsicainide, atenolol, and aspirin were found near by. Hesitation marks were found on the wrist, and strong fibrous degeneration was observed in the cardiomyocytes of the sinoatrial node. The blood concentrations of pilsicainide and atenolol were 7.83 and 4.94 microg/ml, respectively, both far above the reported therapeutic levels. According to these results, we concluded that death was due to cardiac arrhythmia caused by poisoning with pilsicainide and atenolol. This is the first report of fatal poisoning attributable to an overdose of the combination of these two antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "17": "The effect of reactive oxygen species on contractions in beta-escin permeabilized rat detrusor was investigated. Cumulative calcium contractions were inhibited by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and hydroxyl (*OH) but not by superoxide (O(2) *). The sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and the mitochondrial blocker carbonyl cyanide p-trifluromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) decreased the calcium contractions, however in their presence, H(2)O(2) and *OH did not have further effect. Carbachol contractions were inhibited by either H(2)O(2)/*OH/O(2) * or CPA/FCCP. In the presence of CPA, carbachol contractions were not affected by H(2)O(2) and *OH but further decreased by O(2) *. On the other hand, only H(2)O(2) and *OH elicited additional inhibition in carbachol responses in the presence of FCCP. Inositol triphosphate contraction was inhibited by *OH whereas none of the radicals affect carbachol induced calcium sensitization. These results show that H(2)O(2) and *OH affects sarcoplasmic reticulum where O(2) * acts on mitochondria to change contractions in rat detrusor smooth muscle.", 
    "18": "Beta-Adrenoceptors are one of the most widely studied groups of G-protein-coupled receptors but continue to provide surprises and insights that have general relevance to pharmacology. Atypical pharmacologies have been described for ligands formerly (and still) described as antagonists acting at beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors that involve ligand-directed signalling and possibly allosteric interactions at the receptors. In the article by Ngala et al., in this issue of the Br J Pharmacol, another example of atypical interactions with beta-adrenoceptors is described, this time for agonists. Some of the responses to BRL37344 and clenbuterol can be explained in terms of actions at beta(2)-adrenoceptors, whereas others such as the increased glucose uptake and palmitate oxidation observed with pM concentrations of BRL37344 may involve interactions with other (possibly allosteric) sites. Atypical pharmacologies of ligands acting at beta-adrenoceptors have already indicated new ways in which ligands can interact with G-protein-coupled receptors and these mechanisms are likely to have important consequences for future drug development.",

All consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma in both eyes (mean defect greater than -6 dB) who presented for a regular check-up between January and July 2001 at the Instituto Galego de Oftalmolox\u00eda were screened for study eligibility. All participants had been treated with timolol 0.5% BID in both eyes for at least 6 months before the screening visit. Dorzolamide 2% BID was added to timolol 0.5% BID in the eye with the larger visual field defect (study eye), whereas timolol 0.5% BID was continued in the eye with the smaller visual field defect (control eye). Variables evaluated at baseline and every 6 months for 48 months included retrobulbar hemodynamic parameters (using color Doppler imaging), progression of visual field damage, and IOP. Progression of visual field damage was defined according to modified Anderson criteria. Visual field progression-free survival rates for the study and control eyes were plotted using Kaplan-Meier analysis and were compared using a log-rank test.",

Patients' mean (SD) age was 68.0 (7.1) years; all patients were white and 21 (52.5%) were male. Mean baseline IOP was 19.18 (1.34) and 18.23 (1.64) mm Hg in the study and control eyes, respectively (P=0.006). The combination of dorzolamide and timolol was associated with significant increases from baseline in enddiastolic velocity in the ophthalmic and short posterior ciliary arteries (P<0.001) and significant decreases in the resistivity index in both arteries (P<0.001). Twenty-three of the 80 eyes (28.8%) had progression of visual field damage (7 study eyes and 16 control eyes). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the risk of progression was significantly lower in the eye treated with dorzolamide and timolol compared with the eye treated with timolol alone (hazard ratio=0.41; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.94; P=0.035). Mean changes in IOP from baseline to month 48 were -1.10 mm Hg in the dorzolamide and timolol group (95% CI, -1.73 to -0.51; P<0.001) and 1.27 mm Hg in the control group (95% CI, -2.74 to 1.72; P=NS).",

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a very common disease, which is classified as the fourth cause of the chronic morbidity and mortality in the USA. Frequent occurrence, as well as the fact that some risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, are common for both COPD and cardiovascular diseases cause that the number of patients suffering from their coexistence is increasing. Because first beta-blockers had a strong bronchoconstrictory effect, their use is contraindicated in conditions associated with airway obstruction. This review was aimed to investigate the safety of using of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. We try to answer whether selective beta-blockers and so-called hybrid beta-blockers are safe for patients suffering from this disorder. We also try to elaborate some therapeutic recommendations.", 
    "38": "1. Respiratory related arterial pressure variability may reflect body fluid status and/or cardiac sympathetic function. The underlying mechanism is not clear. 2. In the present study, we used an electromagnetic blood flow meter to measure ascending aortic blood flow, from which stroke volume was integrated, to study respiration-stroke volume coupling and its underlying neural regulation. Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats that were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, paralysed with pancuronium and under mechanical ventilation. 3. Programmed irregular ventilation evoked significant variability in arterial pressure, aortic flow and stroke volume signals. Good coupling was noted between lung volume and aortic flow, as well as between lung volume and stroke volume; this coupling persisted under all experimental conditions. The aortic flow power and stroke volume variability and the transfer magnitude of the lung volume-aortic flow and lung volume-stroke volume couplings were suppressed by 1 mg/kg propranolol, but not by 0.3 mg/kg atropine or a combination of 0.3 mg/kg atropine and 2.5 mg/kg phentolamine. 4. These results suggest that respiratory related variability in aortic flow and stroke volume, which ultimately contributes to arterial pressure variability, is primarily under cardiac sympathetic control via beta-adrenoceptors in anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated rats.",

TBARS scores in EPCs from SHRs were significantly higher than those from WKY rats. Celiprolol increased the number of circulating EPCs and stimulated EPC colony formation and migration, while decreasing EPC senescence. Celiprolol inhibited oxidation in EPCs from SHRs, and decreased the expression of NAD(P)H oxidase component mRNAs in the renal cortex, aorta, and heart.",

Using a rat model of regional myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, we investigated the effects of an H2S donor (sodium hydrogen sulfide [NaHS]) on the infarct size and apoptosis caused by ischemia (25 min) and reperfusion (2 h). Furthermore, we investigated the potential mechanism(s) of the cardioprotective effect(s) afforded by NaHS. Specifically, we demonstrate that NaHS (1) attenuates the increase in caspase 9 activity observed in cardiac myocytes isolated from the area at risk (AAR) of hearts subjected in vivo to regional myocardial I/R and (2) ameliorates the decrease in expression of Bcl-2 within the AAR obtained from rat hearts subjected to regional myocardial I/R. The cardioprotective effects of NaHS were abolished by 5-hydroxydeconoate, a putative mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel blocker. Furthermore, NaHS attenuated the increase in the I/R-induced (1) phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase, (2) translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB, (3) intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression, (4) polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation, (5) myeloperoxidase activity, (6) malondialdehyde levels, and (7) nitrotyrosine staining determined in the AAR obtained from rat hearts subjected to regional myocardial I/R. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the cardioprotective effect of NaHS is secondary to a combination of antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects. The antiapoptotic effect of NaHS may be in part due to the opening of the putative mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels.", 
    "44": "Sepsis remains the leading cause for noncardiac intensive care unit deaths in the United States. Despite recent advances in the treatment of this devastating condition, mortality and morbidity remain unacceptably high. Sepsis is characterized by a multitude of pathophysiological changes that include inflammation, metabolic derangements, hemodynamic alterations, and multiorgan dysfunction. Unfortunately, several studies of treatment modalities aimed at correcting one or more of the underlying derangements have led to disappointing results. New treatment modalities are needed. beta-Receptor blockers have long been used for a variety of conditions such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and arterial hypertension. Recent data suggest that beta-blocker effects on metabolism, glucose homeostasis, cytokine expression, and myocardial function may be beneficial in the setting of sepsis. Although treating a potentially hypotensive condition with a drug with antihypertensive properties may initially seem counterintuitive, the metabolic and immunomodulatory properties of beta-blockers may be of benefit. It is the purpose of this review to discuss the effects of beta-blockers on the following: (1) metabolism, (2) glucose regulation, (3) the inflammatory response, (4) cardiac function, and (5) mortality in sepsis.", 
    "45": "The hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rat model elicits cardiovascular deconditioning and simulates the physiological adaptations to microgravity or prolonged bed rest in humans. Although psychological deficits have been documented following bed rest and spaceflight in humans, few studies have explored the psychological effects of cardiovascular deconditioning in animal models. Given the bidirectional link established between cardiac autonomic imbalance and psychological depression in both humans and in animal models, we hypothesized that hindlimb unloading would elicit an alteration in sympathovagal tone and behavioral indexes of psychological depression. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats confined to 14 days of HU displayed anhedonia (a core feature of human depression) compared with casted control (CC) animals evidenced by reduced sucrose preference (CC: 81 +/- 2.9% baseline vs. HU: 58 +/- 4.5% baseline) and reduced (rightward shift) operant responding for rewarding electrical brain stimulation (CC: 4.4 +/- 0.3 muA vs. 7.3 +/- 1.0 muA). Cardiac autonomic blockade revealed elevated sympathetic [CC: -54 +/- 14.1 change in (Delta) beats/min vs. HU: -118 +/- 7.6 Delta beats/min] and reduced parasympathetic (CC: 45 +/- 11.8 Delta beats/min vs. HU: 8 +/- 7.3 Delta beats/min) cardiac tone in HU rats. Heart rate variability was reduced (CC: 10 +/- 1.4 ms vs. HU: 7 +/- 0.7 ms), and spectral analysis of blood pressure indicated loss of total, low-, and high-frequency power, consistent with attenuated baroreflex function. These data indicate that cardiovascular deconditioning results in sympathovagal imbalance and behavioral signs consistent with psychological depression. These findings further elucidate the pathophysiological link between cardiovascular diseases and affective disorders.", 
    "46": "Serotonin (5-HT) release is the primary pharmacological mechanism of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') action in the primate brain. Dopamine release and direct stimulation of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors also contributes to the overall action of MDMA. The role of 5-HT1A receptors in the human psychopharmacology of MDMA, however, has not yet been elucidated. In order to reveal the consequences of manipulation at the 5-HT1A receptor system on cognitive and subjective effects of MDMA, a receptor blocking study using the mixed beta-adrenoreceptor blocker/5-HT1A antagonist pindolol was performed. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject design, 15 healthy male subjects were examined under placebo (PL), 20 mg pindolol (PIN), MDMA (1.6 mg/kg b.wt.), MDMA following pre-treatment with pindolol (PIN-MDMA). Tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery were used for the assessment of cognitive performance. Psychometric questionnaires were applied to measure effects of treatment on core dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness, mood and state anxiety. Compared with PL, MDMA significantly impaired sustained attention and visual-spatial memory, but did not affect executive functions. Pre-treatment with PIN did not significantly alter MDMA-induced impairment of cognitive performance and only exerted a minor modulating effect on two psychometric scales affected by MDMA treatment ('positive derealization' and 'dreaminess'). Our findings suggest that MDMA differentially affects higher cognitive functions, but does not support the hypothesis from animal studies, that some of the MDMA effects are causally mediated through action at the 5-HT1A receptor system.",

Reviewing preoperative data could provide insight into the outpatient treatment of patients presenting for surgical procedures. As gender-based disparities have been demonstrated in the treatment of patients with cardiac disease, we hypothesized that there would be gender disparities in the outpatient pharmacologic management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery.",

    "49": "Of 21,039 ambulatory patients seen in the preanesthesia clinic, 6.4% (1346) had CAD. Patients with CAD: Men were more likely to be taking beta-blockers (P < 0.002), statins (P < 0.0001), aspirin (P < 0.0001), and antiplatelet medications (P < 0.04), although there was a trend of increased use of aspirin (P < 0.01) by women over the course of the study. Patients with history of prior MI: Men with a prior MI were more likely to be taking beta-blockers (P < 0.0001) and statins (P < 0.02), although there was a trend of increased use of beta-blockers (P < 0.0005) and aspirin (P < 0.03) by women over the course of the study. Quarterly prevalence rates for outpatient medication use were greatest for beta-blockers and least for aspirin. Patients were more likely to be taking a statin, aspirin, or oral antiplatelet medication if they were receiving chronic beta-blocker therapy (P < 0.0001 for each medication).", 
    "50": "Aggregating anesthesia management information systems data provides an epidemiological perspective of community care of patients presenting for surgery. We found that gender disparities in outpatient medical treatment of patients with CAD, which previously favored men, have diminished primarily as a result of increased use of these medications in women. Nonetheless, despite evidence supporting the use of risk-reduction strategies, our patients are undertreated with standard medical therapies.", 
    "51": "A polypill for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is under development. It is proposed to contain a combination of antithrombotic agent (aspirin), low-dose blood pressure lowering agents, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), one among a beta-blocker (atenolol) or diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), and a statin (simvastatin/atorvastatin/pravatsatin, etc.). Due to the presence of multiple drugs in the same formulation, there is a strong likelihood of interaction among the drugs and/or their products. In a previous study, we observed formation of a number of interaction/degradation products from atenolol and lisinopril in the presence of aspirin. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to characterize the resolved products using high resolution mass spectrometric and fragmentation analyses using a LC-MS/TOF system. Initially, studies were carried out on the drugs (atenolol, lisinopril and aspirin) to establish their complete fragmentation pattern. These studies were then extended to degraded samples to postulate the structures of interaction/degradation products. The characterized structures were justified through mechanistic explanations.", 
    "52": "Increased arterial stiffness and intima media thickness (IMT) in the common carotid artery (CCA) are related to cardiovascular risk in essential hypertension. Angiotensin II plays an important role in structural and functional changes in the vasculature. In this study, we evaluated the long-term effect of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan, on IMT, arterial stiffness, and hemodynamics in the CCA in patients with essential hypertension. A prospective 24 month study of treatment with valsartan (80-160 mg/day) was performed in 24 hypertensive patients. An ultrasound of the CCA was carried out to determine IMT, the cross-sectional distensibility coefficient (CSDC), the carotid arterial stiffness index beta, and diastolic flow velocity to systolic flow velocity ratio (Vd/Vs). Treatment with valsartan for 24 months reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly. Compared to baseline, the decrease in pulse pressure was greater after 24 months treatment than after 12 months treatment. Valsartan did not influence IMT; however, after 24 months, it caused a significant increase in CSDC and a decrease in stiffness index beta compared to baseline. These changes were not observed after 12 months of treatment. In addition, Vd/Vs, a sensitive marker of relative diastolic blood flow, increased after 24 months' treatment with valsartan. These results suggest that long-term treatment with valsartan improves vascular wall function and hemodynamics in patients with essential hypertension.",

Multivariate predictors of NT-proBNP level were GFR, beta-blocker usage, LV mass index, and hemoglobin level. Plasma BNP was independently predicted by LV mass index and beta-blocker usage but not GFR. In the 74 patients without diastolic dysfunction, there was a significant rise in NT-proBNP but not BNP as GFR declined.",

All six patients survived and recovered well eventually. LMWH and beta-adrenergic blocker were effective to deal with atrial fibrillation. Digitalis and dobutamine were beneficial to prevent heart failure resulted from degenerated porcine valve and dilated cardiomyopathy. In a patient with mechanical mitral valve, low-dose warfarin did not cause fetal malformation, and was effective to prevent thrombus formation. Protamine sulfate was safely administered to neutralize intravenous heparin effect before vaginal delivery. Life-threatening postpartum pulmonary hemorrhage occurred as a result of pulmonary hypertension with an aberrant right pulmonary artery, absolutely necessitating a long-term cardiopulmonary bypass resuscitation. Patient with primary pulmonary hypertension gave birth safely with forceps assistance under epidural anesthesia. From literatures reviewed and successful experiences presented here, prenatal correction of the underlying cardiac malformation, precise switch of anticoagulant administration, optimizing cardiac function, early delivery prior to heart failure, postpartum fluid restriction, minimized peripartum blood loss, and meticulously intensive cares are essential to achieve satisfactory outcomes.", 
    "58": "beta-blockers, as class, improve cardiac function and survival in heart failure (HF). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain elusive. In the present study, metoprolol and carvedilol were used in doses that display comparable heart rate reduction to assess their beneficial effects in a genetic model of sympathetic hyperactivity-induced HF (alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)-ARKO mice). Five month-old HF mice were randomly assigned to receive either saline, metoprolol or carvedilol for 8 weeks and age-matched wild-type mice (WT) were used as controls. HF mice displayed baseline tachycardia, systolic dysfunction evaluated by echocardiography, 50% mortality rate, increased cardiac myocyte width (50%) and ventricular fibrosis (3-fold) compared with WT. All these responses were significantly improved by both treatments. Cardiomyocytes from HF mice showed reduced peak [Ca(2+)](i) transient (13%) using confocal microscopy imaging. Interestingly, while metoprolol improved [Ca(2+)](i) transient, carvedilol had no effect on peak [Ca(2+)](i) transient but also increased [Ca(2+)] transient decay dynamics. We then examined the influence of carvedilol in cardiac oxidative stress as an alternative target to explain its beneficial effects. Indeed, HF mice showed 10-fold decrease in cardiac reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio compared with WT, which was significantly improved only by carvedilol treatment. Taken together, we provide direct evidence that the beneficial effects of metoprolol were mainly associated with improved cardiac Ca(2+) transients and the net balance of cardiac Ca(2+) handling proteins while carvedilol preferentially improved cardiac redox state.",

This study attempts to make this type of comparison in a large CHF population and seeks to identify predictors of death in patients with different comorbidities.", 
    "60": "Study population consisted of 542 consecutive patients who were implanted with either CRT-P (N = 147) or CRT-D (N = 395) between 1999 and 2005. Patients' clinical and follow-up data were entered in a prospective registry and retrieved for analysis. The primary endpoint of this study was all-cause mortality during follow-up. Total all-cause mortality was significantly lower among patients with CRT-D (18.5% vs. 38.8% of CRT-P, chi(2)= 25.11, P < 0.001). Patients with one of three comorbidities--chronic renal failure (OR = 4.885, P = 0.005), diabetes mellitus (OR = 4.130, P = 0.003), and history of atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.473, P = 0.036)--appeared to have higher risk of death, while treatment with beta-blocker (OR = 0.330, P = 0.002) or CRT-D device (OR = 0.334, P = 0.003) seemed to be associated with lower mortality.",

(2) When patients fail to reach blood pressure targets with well-conducted treatment with thiazide diuretics, or this treatment is poorly tolerated, what are the best second-line options? To answer this question, we reviewed the available evidence, based on our standard in-house methodology. (3) We found no published trials specifically designed to evaluate second-line antihypertensive treatments in cardiovascular prevention. There were no available trials of dual- versus single-agent therapy after failure of a thiazide diuretic. (4) When the blood pressure target is not reached, inadequate drug efficacy is only one of several possible causes. Various other factors affecting blood pressure should also be investigated. (5) Dual-agent therapy carries an increased risk of adverse effects and drug interactions compared to monotherapy. (6) There is no consensus among clinical practice guidelines on second-line antihypertensive therapy. However, to minimise the risk of adverse effects, it is clearly better to select single-agent therapy with a drug that has been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in first-line treatment of otherwise healthy hypertensive patients. Possible options include: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers or betablockers. In patients over the age of 60, betablockers seem less effective that the other drugs in preventing strokes. (7) There is too little evidence to choose a specific third-line combination rather than another. However, any adverse effects that the patient experienced during prior treatments should be taken into account.", 
    "64": "Although beta-blockers have been previously shown to effectively reduce blood pressure (BP) and have been used for hypertension treatment for over 40 years, their effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients remains controversial and its use in uncomplicated hypertension is currently under debate. However, data on the above field derive mainly from studies which were conducted with older agents, such as atenolol and metoprolol, while considerable pharamacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity is present within the class of beta-blockers. Carvedilol, a vasodilating non-cardioselective beta-blocker, is a compound that seems to give the opportunity to the clinician to use a cardioprotective agent without the concerning hemodynamic and metabolic actions of traditional beta-blocker therapy. In contrast with conventional beta-blockers, carvedilol maintains cardiac output, has a less extended effect on heart rate and reduces BP by decreasing vascular resistance. Further, several studies has shown that carvedilol has a beneficial or at least neutral effect on metabolic parameters, such as glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and lipid metabolism, suggesting that they could be used in subjects with the metabolic syndrome or diabetes without negative consequences. This article summarizes the distinct pharmacologic, hemodynamic, and metabolic properties of carvedilol in relation to conventional beta-blockers, attempting to examine the potential use of this agent for hypertension treatment.", 
    "65": "The prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) still remains poor, despite the recent advances in medical and surgical treatment. Furthermore, CHF is a major public health problem in most industrialized countries where the elderly population is rapidly increasing. Although the prevalence and mortality of CHF used to be relatively low in Japan, the disorder has been markedly increasing due to the rapid aging of the society and the Westernization of lifestyle that facilitates the development of coronary artery disease. The Chronic Heart Failure Analysis and Registry in the Tohoku District (CHART)-1 study was one of the largest cohorts in Japan. The study has clarified the characteristics and prognosis of Japanese patients with CHF, demonstrating that their prognosis was similarly poor compared with those in Western countries. However, we still need evidence for the prevention and treatment of CHF based on the large cohort studies or randomized treatment trials in the Japanese population. Since the strategy for CHF management is now changing from treatment to prevention, a larger-size prospective cohort, called the CHART-2 study, has been initiated to evaluate the risk factors of CHF in Japan. This review summarizes the current status of CHF studies in Japan and discusses their future perspectives.",

The aim was to lower blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg within a 9-month period. The treatment could be adjusted after 3 and 6 months. Only patients in whom the study protocol was strictly applied were included in this analysis. At completion of the trial the total score averaged 13.1 +/- 70.5 (mean +/- SD) using the fixed-dose combination strategy, compared with -7.2 +/- 81.0 using the sequential monotherapy approach and -17.5 +/- 76.4 using the stepped-care strategy. In conclusion, the use of a score system allows the comparison of antihypertensive therapeutic strategies, taking into account at the same time efficacy and tolerability. In the STRATHE trial the best results were observed with the fixed-dose combination containing low doses of an angiotensin enzyme converting inhibitor (perindopril) and a diuretic (indapamide).",

We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected data of 141 patients with a history of AF (mean duration of AF 35+/-39 months; intermittent AF: n=72; 51%; permanent AF: 69 (49%)) who underwent a left-sided Cryomaze procedure in conjunction with mitral valve (MV) surgery between January 2003 and September 2006. Freedom from AF was 77% at discharge and 87% at a mean follow-up of 305+/-195 days with a decreasing rate of AF during the first 3-9 months from 13% to 9% and an increase beyond the first year (29% at 2 years). Predictors of failed Cryomaze in multivariate analysis were left atrial size >50 mm (OR=5.7), AF at surgery (OR=5.0) and cardiac reoperation (OR=3.4), whereas preoperative beta-blocker treatment was a predictor of success (OR=0.2). Our data suggest that a left-sided Cryomaze procedure effectively restores sinus rhythm in patients with AF undergoing MV surgery. The success rate should not be evaluated immediately postoperatively because there is a steady increase in the rate of patients with freedom from AF in the first year. It appears, however, that there is a higher rate of recurrence during later follow-up.", 
    "68": "Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is very effective in the treatment of resistant schizophrenia. However, cardiotoxicity of clozapine, particularly in young patients, has raised concerns about its safety. Increased catecholamines have been postulated to trigger an inflammatory response resulting in myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and death, although this has not yet been thoroughly studied. Here, we used the mouse to study whether clozapine administration could cause adverse myocarditis associated with an increase in catecholamines. Male Balb/C mice, age ~6 weeks, were administered 5, 10 or 25 mg/kg clozapine daily for 7 and 14 days; one group was administered 25 mg/kg clozapine plus 2 mg/kg propranolol for 14 days. Saline-treated mice served as controls. Heart sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological examination. Plasma catecholamines were measured with HPLC. Myocardial TNF-alpha concentrations were determined by ELISA. Histopathology of clozapine-treated mice showed a significant dose-related increase in myocardial inflammation that correlated with plasma catecholamine levels and release of TNF-alpha. Propranolol significantly attenuated these effects. A hypercatecholaminergic state induced by clozapine could explain the occurrence of myocarditis in some patients. Our data suggest that a beta-adrenergic blocking agent may be effective in reducing the incidence and severity of clozapine-induced myocarditis.",

Despite clear signals that certain risk factors and diseases vary as a function of race, translating those differences into race-based therapeutics has been awkward and has done little to change the natural history of cardiovascular disease as it affects special populations. Among the varied special populations, the African American population appears to have the most significant and adverse variances for cardiovascular disease as well as worrisome signals that drug responsiveness varies. Recent guideline statements have now acknowledged certain treatment options that are most appropriate for African Americans with cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension and heart failure. As more physiologic markers of disease and drug responsiveness become available, the need for racial designations in medicine may lessen, and therapies can be optimized for all patients without regard to race or ethnicity.", 
    "97": "The effects of alcohol on the CE enantioseparation of selected basic drugs with gamma-CD as the chiral selector was investigated. The enantioseparation behavior of the analytes with gamma-CD in the absence and presence of different alcohols specifically methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol (IPA), and 2-methyl-2-propanol (TBA), the relationship of enantiomeric resolution (R(s)) values with either hydrophobicity or bulkiness of the alcohols, as well as the effect of these alcohols on interaction of the analytes with gamma-CD were studied. Results showed that hydrophobicity and/or bulkiness of alcohols have an influence on the enantioresolution of most of the analytes based on the relatively high correlation coefficients (R) obtained between R(s) versus log P and between R(s) versus ovality (i.e., parameter to indicate bulkiness of a molecule). Comparison of the values of the average binding constants obtained for each enantiomeric pair in the presence and absence of 5% IPA showed that alcohols can increase, decrease, or give a minimal effect on the analyte-gamma-CD interaction depending on the analyte. Furthermore, the significant enhancement in the enantioresolution of both propranolol and pindolol in the presence of either IPA or TBA led to the baseline enantioresolution of both drugs using 35 mM gamma-CD.", 
    "98": "The present study shows a new nano-liquid chromatographic method for beta-blocker enantiomers' separation. This method consists of using a capillary column packed with silica particles which were chemically modified with vancomycin. On-column focusing allowed to inject relatively high sample volumes (1500 nL) increasing method sensitivity. The studied racemic compounds, namely atenolol, propranolol, oxprenolol, and metoprolol were dissolved in methanol and injected for chromatographic separation. The effect of injected sample volume was studied in the range of 50-2100 nL. Peak height of the two alprenolol enantiomers increased linearly up to 1500 nL. This volume was injected for validation and sample analysis. Under optimal experimental conditions, LODs and LOQs (LOD and LOQ for each alprenolol enantiomers) were 9.0 and 15.6 ng/mL, respectively. Calibration curves were linear in the studied range (9-250 ng/mL). The optimized method was applied to the analysis of a human plasma sample spiked with racemic alprenolol.", 
    "99": "The objective of this study was to prepare and evaluate a novel spray-dried tableting excipient using a mixture of chitosan and lactose. Three different grades of chitosan (low-, medium-, and high-molecular-weight) were used for this study. Propranolol hydrochloride was used as a model drug. A specific amount of chitosan (1, 1.9, and 2.5 g, respectively) was dissolved in 50 mL of an aqueous solution of citric acid (1%) and later mixed with 50 mL of an aqueous solution containing lactose (20, 19.1, and 18.5 g, respectively) and propanolol (2.2 g). The resultant solution was sprayed through a laboratory spray drier at 1.4 mL/min. The granules were evaluated for bulk density, tap density, Carr index, particle size distribution, surface morphology, thermal properties, and tableting properties. Bulk density of the granules decreased from 0.16 to 0.13 g/mL when the granules were prepared using medium- or high-molecular-weight chitosan compared with the low-molecular-weight chitosan. The relative proportion of chitosan also showed a significant effect on the bulk density. The granules prepared with 1 g of low-molecular-weight chitosan showed the minimum Carr index (11.1%) indicating the best flow properties among all five formulations. All three granules prepared with 1 g chitosan, irrespective of their molecular weight, showed excellent flow properties. Floating tablets prepared by direct compression of these granules with sodium bicarbonate showed 50% drug release between 30 and 35 min. In conclusion, the spray-dried granules prepared with chitosan and lactose showed excellent flow properties and were suitable for tableting.", 
    "100": "Laboratory studies make clear that the sympathetic nervous system does impact on bone cell and tissue function. However, these effects are inconsistent between models, possibly reflecting sympathetic effects at different levels, from the central nervous system through to the bone cells. Observational studies of the use of beta-blockers are confounded by the indications for which these drugs are prescribed, and by other medications that are commonly co-prescribed with them. These data are inconsistent, although a recent meta-analysis did conclude that beta-blocker use was associated with a significant decrease in fracture risk. However, the more recent studies cast doubt on this finding, and the limited data regarding fractures in randomized controlled trials certainly do not support this conclusion. Therefore, there is not an adequate evidence base to support using beta-blockers as a treatment for osteoporosis, nor can they be regarded as a discriminating risk factor for fracture assessment. Until there are definitive randomized, controlled trials of beta-blockers, which include fracture as an endpoint, it is unlikely that the current confusing situation will be resolved.", 
    "101": "The authors investigated the antinociceptive activity of sildenafil and adrenergic agents co-administered in the writhing test in mice. The intensity of nociception was quantified by the number of writhes occurring between 0 and 30 min after stimulus injection. Nontreated groups (NT) received acid intraperitoneally (ip) followed by sterile saline (ip). Animals received (ip) sildenafil (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), propranolol (0.5 or 2 mg/kg), atenolol (0.05 or 2 mg/kg), prazosin (0.05 or 0.25 mg/kg) or clonidine (0.01 or 0.1 mg/kg) 30 min before acid injection. It was observed that only the largest doses of every drug inhibited the number of writhes in mice. In another series of experiments, animals were pretreated with the lower ineffective doses of propranolol, atenolol, prazosin or clonidine. After 30 min, mice also received the lower ineffective dose of sildenafil followed by acid injection. The combination of ineffective doses of propranolol, atenolol, prazosin or clonidine with sildenafil significantly inhibited the nociceptive response induced by acetic acid injection. Data obtained from these experiments showed that ineffective doses of sildenafil associated with ineffective doses of adrenergic agents provided analgesic effects in the writhing test.", 
    "102": "In this report we investigated the effect of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), a specific neuronal inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and L-NAME, a nonselective NOS inhibitor upon the adrenergic- and CRH-induced stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in nonanesthetized rats. 7-NI given i.p. and L-NAME administered i.c.v. considerably reduced ACTH and corticosterone secretion induced by phenylephrine (30 microg i.c.v.), an alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor agonist. These inhibitors also diminished the HPA response to isoprenaline (20 microg i.c.v.), a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, and i.c.v. L-NAME significantly lowered the ACTH and corticosterone response to clenbuterol (10 microg i.c.v.), a selective beta(2)-adrenergic agonist. L-NAME abolished the noradrenaline (NA), an alpha- and beta-receptor agonist-evoked ACTH and corticosterone response, which was reversed by pretreatment with i.p. L-arginine, an endogenous NO substrate. 7-NI abolished the stimulatory action of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH 1 microg/kg i.p.) on ACTH but not corticosterone secretion. L-NAME only moderately diminished the CRH-induced ACTH secretion, suggesting that a major part of the CRH-induced HPA axis activation is of neuronal origin. Dihydropyridine, nifedipine, a specific L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, inhibited significantly the CRH-induced ACTH and corticosterone response in rats exposed to 3 days crowding stress but not in rats under basal conditions. This finding indicates the strategic importance of Ca(2+) influx into the pituitary corticotrops to meet increased secretory requirement under stressful conditions. Collectively, our results point to complex functional relationship between NO, adrenergic agents CRH and Ca(2+) in the regulation of HPA axis activity.",

After controlled chemical ulcer induction, probes were implanted in the ulcerated and healthy stomach submucosa, stomach lumen and in the blood. To assess the significance of this multiple probe approach, drug concentrations in each probe location were monitored after selected compounds were dosed to the ligated stomach by oral gavage.

Next, to achieve global optimum a multivariate D-optimal design was used. Although multivariate approach did not improve enantioresolution any further, analysis time was significantly reduced. Under optimum CEC-MS conditions, all stereoisomers were resolved with resolution in the range 1.0-3.1 in less than 60 min with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) greater than 1000.

    "122": "In the present study, the interaction between morphine and the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (PROP), in memory consolidation was investigated in a two-trial recognition Y-maze task. Four sets of Y-maze experiments were carried out in mice, with 2 and 4 h inter-trial intervals (ITI) and all drugs administered immediately after the training trials. In the first and second sets of experiments, post-training administration of morphine (0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) or PROP (2, 10 and 20 mg/kg) alone did not impair memory consolidation after a 2 h ITI. However, in the third and fourth sets of experiments, co-administration of these ineffective doses of morphine (0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) and PROP (2, 10 and 20 mg/kg) disrupted memory consolidation after a 2 h ITI. Moreover, the relatively higher dose of morphine (2.5 mg/kg) plus the relatively higher doses of PROP (10 and 20 mg/kg) disrupted memory consolidation to a greater extent after a 2 h ITI. Locomotor activity was not affected by any of the drug treatments. Our data shows that morphine and PROP co-administration disrupts the consolidation of spatial recognition memory, suggesting that inactivation of the beta-adrenergic system may contribute to morphine-induced impairment of memory.",

Aldosterone is known to enhance both renal and colonic K(+) secretion. In mouse distal colon K(+) secretion occurs exclusively via luminal K(Ca)1.1 (BK) channels. Here we investigate if aldosterone stimulates colonic K(+) secretion via BK channels. Luminal Ba(2+) and iberiotoxin (IBTX)-sensitive electrogenic K(+) secretion was measured in Ussing chambers. In vivo aldosterone was augmented via a high K(+) diet. High K(+) diet led to a 2-fold increase of luminal Ba(2+) and IBTX-sensitive short-circuit current in distal mouse colonic mucosa. This effect was absent in BK alpha-subunit-deficient (BK(-/-)) mice. The resting and diet-induced K(+) secretion was stimulated by luminal ionomycin. In BK(-/-) mice luminal ionomycin did not stimulate K(+) secretion. In vitro addition of aldosterone likewise triggered a 2-fold increase in K(+) secretion, which was inhibited by the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone and the BK channel blocker IBTX. Semi-quantification of mRNA from colonic crypts showed up-regulation of BK alpha- and beta(2)-subunits in high K(+) diet mice. The BK channel could be detected luminally in colonic crypt cells by immunohistochemistry. The expression level of the channel in the luminal membrane was strongly up-regulated in K(+)-loaded animals. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that aldosterone-induced K(+) secretion occurs via increased expression of luminal BK channels.",

    "152": "Twenty nine children affected by QT long syndrome were admitted to the Division of Pediatric Cardiology of the Casa del Sole Hospital of Palermo (Italy). Their diagnosis was made by electrocardiogram (ECG). The average age of the patients was 7.6 years. The average follow-up was 4 years and three months. A therapy with beta-blocker was administered to all the children. During the follow-up of 4 year and three months, patients were genotyped. Twenty-three out of 29 children had at least one relative affected by the syndrome. Three of them had a familiar dead because of this syndrome and everyone had a duration of maximum QTc higher than the cut off (P=0.0002). All the people who died had not followed the therapy with beta-blocker. Patients with a maximum QTc recorded <500 had not familiar death by this syndrome.", 
    "153": "Holter and echocardiogram recorded periodically during the observation did not show dangerous arrhythmic events. All children maintained a good health during the follow-up.", 
    "154": "Although conducted on a small study population, the data analysis recorded during this study suggests that in patients affected by QT long syndrome younger than 16 years old undergoing a beta-blocker therapy the prognosis is excellent. The duration of QTc interval appears as a negative prognostic factor, although the beta-blocker therapy has been reduced considerably the incidence of sudden death.",

    "156": "This was a retrospective cohort study of older patients who were discharged after MI in two Eastern states between 1995 and 2004. Patients were categorized as having ESRD, having chronic kidney disease (CKD), and being free from diagnosed CKD. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), beta blockers (BB), and statins was assessed within 30 d after discharge. Good adherence was defined as proportion of days covered >80% during the first year after discharge.", 
    "157": "Compared with patients with no CKD, patients with CKD had 22% lower adjusted use of ACEI/ARB but similar rates of BB and statin use. Patients with ESRD experienced 43% lower ACEI/ARB and 17% lower statin use. Only 64% (BB), 57% (statins), and 54% (ACEI/ARB) of patients had good 1-yr adherence. Adherence was similar between patients with CKD and with no CKD for all study drugs. Fewer patients with ESRD had good adherence to BB.", 
    "158": "With the exception of lower ACEI/ARB use in patients with CKD, we found no differences between patients with CKD and with no CKD in their use of and adherence to these cardiovascular medications after MI. Patients with ESRD experienced lower use of ACEI/ARB and statins and lower adherence to BB regimens. Postulated differences in medication use after MI across levels of kidney function are unlikely to explain the observed differences in long-term outcomes.", 
    "159": "Extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and pleurectomy are the surgical procedures for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma. However, EPP increases the risk for postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). We conducted a retrospective chart review of 130 patients who underwent EPP or pleurectomy. Seventy patients (excluding three patients with a prior history of AF) underwent EPP and 57 patients underwent pleurectomy. The mean ages were 60+/-11 and 63+/-13 years, and the male to female ratios were 50/20 and 44/13, respectively. Postoperative AF was observed in 45 patients with 36 (51%) of these cases occurring after EPP and 9 (17%) after pleurectomy (P<0.0001). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for gender, age, side of affected lung, preoperative heart rate, history of beta-blocker use, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Through logistic regression, EPP (OR=7.1, 95% CI: 2.9, 17.8) and age over 65 years (OR=2.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 6.8) were found to be risk factors for AF. We conclude that EPP vs. pleurectomy and age over 65 years are risk factors for postoperative AF. The increased odds of having AF after EPP could be due to right heart stress caused by pneumonectomy.", 
    "160": "The buccal region offers an attractive route of administration for systemic drug delivery. Carvedilol (dose, 3.125-25 mg) is beta-adrenergic antagonist. Its oral bioavailability is 25-35% because of first pass metabolism. Buccal absorption studies of a carvedilol solution in human volunteers showed 32.86% drug absorption. FTIR and UV spectroscopic methods revealed that there was no interaction between carvedilol and polymers. Carvedilol patches were prepared using HPMC, carbopol 934, eudragit RS 100, and ethylcellulose. The patches were evaluated for their thickness uniformity, folding endurance, weight uniformity, content uniformity, swelling behaviour, tensile strength, and surface pH. In vitro release studies were conducted for carvedilol-loaded patches in phosphate buffer (pH, 6.6) solution. Patches exhibited drug release in the range of 86.26 to 98.32% in 90 min. Data of in vitro release from patches were fit to different equations and kinetic models to explain release profiles. Kinetic models used were zero and first-order equations, Hixon-Crowell, Higuchi, and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. In vivo drug release studies in rabbits showed 90.85% of drug release from HPMC-carbopol patch while it was 74.63 to 88.02% within 90 min in human volunteers. Good correlation among in vitro release and in vivo release of carvedilol was observed.",

All patients were on a beta-blocker and an ACE-inhibitor (or angiotensin-II receptor-blocker) and 151 were taking an aldosterone antagonist.", 
    "163": "At baseline, subjects treated with aldosterone antagonists had a higher NYHA class, a larger left-ventricular end-diastolic volume, a worse ejection fraction and a higher systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP). During follow-up, a greater reduction in sPAP and a tendency towards improved systolic and diastolic function were observed in subjects treated with aldosterone antagonists. Moreover, clinical and laboratory parameters did not deteriorate in patients taking aldosterone antagonists. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups (8.6% vs. 8.8%, P = NS).",

Thalidomide therapy for MM was added to longstanding atenolol therapy one month prior to presentation. His heart rate (HR) was around 70 beats per minute (bpm) before addition of Thalidomide. His HR on presentation was less than 30 bpm. He was treated with intravenous atropine followed by temporary pacemaker and taken off atenolol. His HR returned to around 70 bpm few days after discontinuation of atenolol, even though he was still taking thalidomide, permitting outpatient management without a pacemaker. Both thalidomide and atenolol have been reported to cause bradycardia. Neither agent caused bradycardia when used alone in this patient, but simultaneous use caused symptomatic bradycardia. As thalidomide is prescribed more frequently, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of drug-induced sinus bradycardia due to the interaction of thalidomide and beta-blockers.",

A total of 32,259 MI patients were included in the study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the risks of death and recurrent MI related to treatment with different beta-blockers.", 
    "168": "The risks for death and recurrent MI were similar in patients using different beta-blockers, except that mortality from all causes among patients with a prescription for sotalol was higher. Subgroup analyses of high-risk patients with diabetes or congestive heart failure and of patients using comparable dosages of beta-blockers did not show effects on the risk of death or recurrent MI.",

    "170": "In the treatment of arrhythmia, beta-blockers are mainly used to regulate the heart rate. However, beta-blockers are also known as drugs with an antiarrhythmic effect due to the suppression of sympathetic activity. We evaluated the antiarrhythmic effects of a highly selective beta(1)-blocker, bisoprolol, in patients with diurnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P-AF). A total of 136 patients with symptomatic diurnal P-AF were enrolled. Patients were divided into a diurnal-specific P-AF group and a diurnal & nocturnal P-AF group, as well as into a bisoprolol single use group and a combined use group with an antiarrhythmic drug. The effects of bisoprolol were evaluated in 3 categories: subjective symptom improvement, quality of life (QOL) improvement, and elimination of P-AF episode in Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs). For patients with effective treatment, a long-term effect up to 24 months was evaluated. Five patients (3.7%) discontinued bisoprolol due to side effects. Following administration of bisoprolol, 109 patients (80%) experienced subjective symptom improvement, 103 patients (76%) experienced QOL improvement, and elimination of P-AF episodes in ECGs was observed in 84 patients (62%). The elimination rate of P-AF episodes in ECGs was higher in the diurnal P-AF group than in the diurnal & nocturnal P-AF group (P=0.042). There was no significant difference between the bisoprolol single use group and the combined use group. A long-term suppressive effect by bisoprolol was observed in 70 of 83 patients (84%). The results demonstrate that bisoprolol has an antiarrhythmic effect against sympathetic diurnal P-AF, improving subjective symptoms and QOL and eliminating P-AF episodes in ECGs.", 
    "171": "The quantification of mixtures of (R)- and (S)-propranolol (PRO) in the pure form and in the pharmaceutical preparations is described. The methodology is based on chiral recognition of propranolol by formation of an inclusion complex with beta-cyclodextrin (CD), a chiral auxiliary, in the presence of 1-butanol. The excitation-emission fluorescence surface and second-order multivariate calibration such as bilinear least squares (BLLS) and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were used in the model development. BLLS performed better than PARAFAC, presenting relative mean error in the order of 3.5%, analytical sensitivity of 0.07% and 0.08%, detection limit of 0.23% and 0.28% and quantification limit of 0.71% and 0.84% for the pure form and pharmaceutical preparations, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed methodology can be an alternative for the determination of propranolol enantiomeric composition.",

At the end of the run-in, and the end of each treatment period, the intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured every 2 hours between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM.", 
    "174": "Thirty-one patients completed at least one time point in both treatment periods. Both treatments reduced the IOP for the diurnal curve, and at each time point, from the timolol run-in baseline (p<0.0001). The 12-hour IOP on timolol was 22.1+/-2.8 mmHg, whereas on DTFC it was 18.1+/-2.8 and latanoprost 18.3+/-3.1 mmHg (p=0.4). Further, there was no statistical difference in IOP between treatments at any time point (p< or =0.1). There was no statistical difference for any individual adverse event between treatments (p>0.05).",

    "176": "The aim of this study was to prepare poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) microparticles of Levobunolol HC1 (L-HC1) for use as an anti-glaucomatous drug to the eye. The double emulsion (W/O/W) solvent evaporation technique was used for encapsulating L-HC1 as a hydrophilic drug. The study examined the impact of different factors including the pH and volume of the external aqueous phase, the concentration of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and Pluronic F68 (PF68) used as stabilizers and drug/polymer ratios on the characteristics of the microparticles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to identify the physical state of the drug and polymer. The zeta potential of the particles was also identified. Entrapment efficiency was found to be highest with a 0.5% PVA concentration and 100 mL volume of external aqueous phase at pH 12. The high efficiency was due to a reduction in the degree of drug ionization. The microparticles were spherical and appropriately sized for ophthalmic application. Drug release from the microparticles appears to consist of two components, with an initial rapid release followed by a slower stage. Drug release was slower when the microparticle was incorporated into the thermally reversible gel (Pluronic F127) in comparison to drug release from the free drug incorporated into the gel and drug release from the free microparticle.",

Electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded at the end of placebo and drug periods. Measurements of repolarization duration (QT intervals), repolarization heterogeneity (T-wave peak to T-wave end (TPE) intervals), and T-wave morphology (T-wave principal component analysis (PCA) ratio, T-wave morphology dispersion (TMD), and total cosine R-to-T (TCRT)) during each drug were compared to placebo measurements.",

Losartan also shortened precordial maximum TPE interval and decreased PCA ratio. Amlodipine had no repolarization effects, whereas HCTZ prolonged precordial maximum TPE interval and mean TPE interval.", 
    "180": "Losartan and bisoprolol have beneficial short-term ECG repolarization effects. Amlodipine seems to have no repolarization effects. HCTZ seems to prolong the ECG TPE interval, potentially reflecting increased repolarization heterogeneity. These findings show that antihypertensive drugs may relatively rapidly and treatment-specifically modulate ECG markers of ventricular repolarization.", 
    "181": "The utility of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists post myocardial infarction was established in the pre-thrombolytic era. Evidence for improvement in long-term prognosis with metoprolol, timolol and propranolol in particular derives from reduction in event rates in patients who have had substantial left ventricular damage at the time of infarction and probably correlates largely with the more recently demonstrated salutary effects of this group of drugs in patients with chronic heart failure. In all other respects, evidence for beneficial effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in peri-infarct and post-infarct therapeutics is equivocal. They appear to exert no major influence on outcomes in patients with unstable angina, nor do they markedly alter early clinical course in uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction, irrespective of other interventions. Furthermore, the limited available analyses suggest no discernible beneficial effect on long-term outcomes post-uncomplicated infarction. It is possible that in such patients, current recommendations for 'routine' long-term beta-adrenoceptor blockade can no longer be justified.", 
    "182": "Diuretics have been the cornerstone of acute heart failure (AHF) therapy for >200 years, although the treatment of chronic heart failure has changed dramatically over the past decades with the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, and aldosterone inhibitors. These treatment modalities were never tested prospectively in the acute setting. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of prospective data on the use of diuretics in both chronic (CHF) and AHF. Hence, despite lack of knowledge on their efficacy and safety, diuretics remain an essential component of the current management of AHF and CHF. In the present manuscript we will address the practical concerns regarding diuretic selection, dosage, combination regimens, and the importance of achieving clinical improvement with minimal changes to kidney function in patients with AHF.

    "183": "In patients with malignant hypertension, immediate blood pressure reduction is indicated to prevent further organ damage. Because cerebral autoregulatory capacity is impaired in these patients, a pharmacologically induced decline of blood pressure reduces cerebral blood flow with the danger of cerebral hypoperfusion. We compared the reduction in transcranial Doppler-determined middle cerebral artery blood velocity during blood pressure lowering with sodium nitroprusside with that of labetalol. Therefore, in 15 patients, fulfilling World Health Organization criteria for malignant hypertension, beat-to-beat mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance (Modelflow), mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity, and cerebrovascular resistance index (mean blood pressure:mean middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity ratio), were monitored during treatment with sodium nitroprusside (n=8) or labetalol (n=7). The reduction in mean arterial blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside (-28+/-3%; mean+/-SEM) and labetalol (-28+/-4%) was comparable. With labetalol, both systemic and cerebral vascular resistance decreased proportionally (-13+/-10% and -17+/-5%), whereas with sodium nitroprusside, the decline in systemic vascular resistance was larger than that in cerebral vascular resistance (-53+/-4% and -7+/-4%). The rate of reduction in middle cerebral artery blood velocity was smaller with labetalol than with sodium nitroprusside (0.45+/-0.05% versus 0.78+/-0.04% cm.s(-1).%mm Hg(-1); P<0.05). In conclusion, sodium nitroprusside reduced systemic vascular resistance rather than cerebral vascular resistance with a larger rate of reduction in middle cerebral artery blood velocity, suggesting a preferential blood flow to the low resistance systemic vascular bed rather than the cerebral vascular bed.", 
    "184": "Aspirin and clopidogrel are used therapeutically for their anti-platelet effects. We examined the effects of aspirin and clopidogrel on basal and beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR)-mediated platelet nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in healthy subjects and patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Healthy subjects (n=19) were randomized in a double-blind cross-over manner to receive aspirin or clopidogrel, each at 75 mg daily, for 14 days. Patients (n=17) of similar age with CHD, taking aspirin, were randomized double-blind to either continue on aspirin 75 mg daily or to receive clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 14 days. NO synthase (NOS) activity was measured from l-[(3)H]arginine to l-[(3)H]citrulline conversion, and cGMP was determined by radioimmunoassay, in platelets basally and following incubation with isoproterenol or albuterol (each at 10(-5) mol/L). In healthy subjects, aspirin did not affect basal NOS activity or cGMP in platelets, but suppressed the normal increase in both by isoproterenol and albuterol. Clopidogrel suppressed platelet NOS activity and cGMP both basally and in response to beta-AR agonists. In platelets from CHD patients, clopidogrel suppressed basal and beta-AR-stimulated NOS activity and cGMP as compared with aspirin. Platelet NOS activity and cGMP were lower in CHD subjects pre-randomization compared with healthy subjects both pre-randomization and post-aspirin. We conclude that chronic aspirin treatment suppresses beta-AR-stimulated but not basal platelet NO synthesis, as previously described, whereas chronic clopidogrel treatment suppresses both, with resultant functional consequences. Moreover, CHD may itself be associated with decreased platelet NO biosynthesis.",

    "186": "The rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have decreased significantly for men over the past few decades, but similar reductions have not occurred in women. Consequently, CVD remains the leading killer of women in the United States. Men usually develop heart disease earlier than women, but women develop heart disease more rapidly once menopause has occurred. A review of risk factors that are common between men and women demonstrates some notable sex-dependent differences. Many of these changes appear related to the hormonal changes that occur in menopause, such as the development of hypertension, changes in lipid concentrations, and central adiposity. In addition, diabetes is a more significant risk factor for CVD in women than men. Sociologic and physiologic factors need to be considered in treatment of risk factors, such as smoking, lack of exercise, obesity, and depression. Prevention is known to significantly reduce CVD risk, but new goals are being established for women as the sex-dependent differences have become apparent.", 
    "187": "Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary cardiac disease characterized by a prolongation of the QT interval at basal ECG and by a high risk of life-threatening arrhythmias. Disease prevalence is estimated at close to 1 in 2,500 live births. The two cardinal manifestations of LQTS are syncopal episodes, that may lead to cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death, and electrocardiographic abnormalities, including prolongation of the QT interval and T wave abnormalities. The genetic basis of the disease was identified in the mid-nineties and all the LQTS genes identified so far encode cardiac ion channel subunits or proteins involved in modulating ionic currents. Mutations in these genes (KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, KCNE2, CACNA1c, CAV3, SCN5A, SCN4B) cause the disease by prolonging the duration of the action potential. The most prevalent LQTS variant (LQT1) is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene, with approximately half of the genotyped patients carrying KCNQ1 mutations. Given the characteristic features of LQTS, the typical cases present no diagnostic difficulties for physicians aware of the disease. However, borderline cases are more complex and require the evaluation of various electrocardiographic, clinical, and familial findings, as proposed in specific diagnostic criteria. Additionally, molecular screening is now part of the diagnostic process. Treatment should always begin with beta-blockers, unless there are valid contraindications. If the patient has one more syncope despite a full dose beta-blockade, left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) should be performed without hesitation and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy should be considered with the final decision being based on the individual patient characteristics (age, sex, clinical history, genetic subgroup including mutation-specific features in some cases, presence of ECG signs - including 24-hour Holter recordings - indicating high electrical instability). The prognosis of the disease is usually good in patients that are correctly diagnosed and treated. However, there are a few exceptions: patients with Timothy syndrome, patients with Jervell Lange-Nielsen syndrome carrying KCNQ1 mutations and LQT3 patients with 2:1 atrio-ventricular block and very early occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias.", 
    "188": "Circadian variation of onset of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been noted in many studies, but there are no data about subgroups of patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Because of abnormalities in the circadian rhythm of autonomic tone after surgery, it was very interesting to analyze the circadian patterns in the onset of symptoms of AMI in various subgroups of 1784 patients with previous CABG. As in the other studies, a peak occurred in the morning hours with 26.3% of the patients, but there was a second nearly equal, but higher, peak (26.4%) in the evening hours. The subgroups with specific clinical characteristics exhibited different patterns that determined these peaks in all populations. In patients older than 70 years of age, in both sexes, in smokers, diabetics, in patients with hypertension, in those undergoing beta-blocker therapy, and in patients without previous angina, two nearly equal peaks were observed, with higher evening peaks, except in those patients with hypertension and without angina. Only one peak in the evening hours was observed in a subgroup of patients with previous congestive heart failure (CHF) and non-STEMI. The subgroup of patients with previous angina and previous AMI exhibited no discernible peaks. The distribution of time of onset within the four intervals was not uniform, and the difference was statistically significant only for patients undergoing beta-blocker therapy at time of onset (p = 0.0013), nonsmokers (p = 0.0283), and patients with non-STEMI (p = 0.0412). It is well known that patients with AMI have a dominant morning peak of circadian variation of onset. However, analyzing a different subgroup of patients with AMI after previous CABG, it was found that some subgroups had two peaks of onset, but a higher evening peak (patients older than 70 years of age, smokers, diabetics, and a group of patients who were taking beta-blocker therapy). This subgroup of patients, together with the subgroups of patients with a dominant evening peak (patients with CHF and those with non-STEMI) and with patients with no peak (patients with previous angina and previous AMI), probably appear to modify characteristic circadian variation of infarction onset, expressing a higher evening peak, respectively to the previous CABG, with adverse consequences for central nervous system functioning.",

Female Wistar rats (n=70) were divided into five groups: Sedentary Sham (SS); Trained Sham (TS); Trained Hypertensive Sham treated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (THS); Trained Ovariectomized (TO); and Trained Hypertensive Ovariectomized treated with L-NAME (THO). Trained groups were submitted to a physical training during 10 weeks. The cardiovascular autonomic control was investigated in all groups using different approaches: 1) pharmacological evaluation of autonomic tonus with methylatropine and propranolol; 2) analysis of heart rate (HR) and systolic arterial pressure (AP) variability; 3) spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) evaluation. Hypertension was observed in THS and THO groups. Pharmacological analysis showed that TS group had increased predominance of autonomic vagal tonus compared to SS group. HR and intrinsic HR were found to be reduced in all trained animals. TS group, compared to other groups, showed a reduction in LF oscillations (LF=0.2-0.75 Hz) of pulse interval in both absolute and normalized units as well as an increase in HF oscillations (HF=0.75-2.50 Hz) in normalized unit. BRS analysis showed that alpha-index was different between all groups. TS group presented the greatest value, followed by the TO, SS, THO and THS groups. Ovariectomy has negative effects on cardiac autonomic modulation in trained rats, which is characterized by an increase in the sympathetic autonomic modulation. These negative effects suggest NO deficiency. In contrast, the ovariectomy seems to have no effect on AP variability.", 
    "206": "A 9-year-old male neutered Devon Rex cat was presented for continued investigations following a 7-year history of recurrent syncope. Previous diagnostic tests, including 24h (Holter) electrocardiographic monitoring, had failed to identify the aetiology of such episodes, and former empirical treatment with atenolol had not provided satisfactory control of the clinical signs. A conclusive diagnosis was eventually achieved using an implantable loop recorder (Reveal), which identified paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) associated with a syncopal episode. Treatment with oral sotalol was instituted and, 18 months after initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy, no further syncopal episodes have been observed by the cat's owners."
