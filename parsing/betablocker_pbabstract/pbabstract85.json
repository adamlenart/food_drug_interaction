The clinical significance of variants modulating toxicity (e.g. SLCO1B1 with simvastatin) has also been confirmed. The genetic contribution to variable efficacy and toxicity of other important classes of cardiovascular drugs, such as beta-blockers, is becoming increasingly recognized. Prospective trials testing whether the use of genomic information improves clinical care are underway. Guidance based on the most well-established pharmacogenomic findings has appeared in prescribing labeling and is in the early stages of being implemented into routine clinical care.",

The first phase was carried out from the beginning of February to the end of May 2007, and the second phase was from the beginning of March to the end of June 2008. Patients with CKD who had an estimated creatinine clearance \u2264 50 mL/min and were older than 18 years were included. A data collection form was used to collect data from the patients' medical records and chart review. All systemic medications prescribed during hospitalization were included. The patients were prescribed 5795 medications. During the first phase, the patients were prescribed 2814 medication orders of 176 different medications. The prescriptions were 2981 of 158 medications during the second phase. The mean number of medications in the first and second phases was 9.38 \u00b1 3.63 and 9.94 \u00b1 3.78 respectively (P-value = 0.066). The top five used medications were calcium carbonate, folic acid/vitamin B complex, metoprolol, lovastatin, and ferrous sulfate. The most commonly used medication classes were mineral supplements, vitamins, antianemic preparations, antibacterials, and beta-blocking agents. This study provides an overview of prescription practice in a cohort of hospitalized CKD patients and indicates possible areas of improvement in prescription practice.",

Clinical signs can be delayed by many hours after exposure in some cases, with hypotension and cardiac rhythm changes (bradycardia, atrioventricular block, or tachycardia) as the predominant signs. Prompt decontamination and aggressive treatment using a variety of modalities may be necessary to treat patients exposed to calcium channel blockers. The prognosis of an exposed patient depends on the severity of signs and response to treatment.",

While the motivations for personalized and predictive medicine are promising for patient care and support a model of health system efficiency, the implementation of pharmacogenomics for cardiovascular therapeutics on a population scale faces substantial challenges. The greatest obstacle to clinical implementation of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics may be the lack of both reproducibility and agreement about the validity and utility of the findings. In this review, we present the scientific evidence in the literature for diagnostic variants for the US FDA-labeled cardiovascular therapies, namely CYP2C19 and clopidogrel, CYP2C9/VKORC1 and warfarin, and CYP2D6/ADRB1 and \u03b2-blockers.

We aimed to assess the maintenance of hemodynamic response and its impact on outcomes in a large cohort of hemodynamic responders during a long follow-up. One hundred three patients with cirrhosis admitted with acute variceal bleeding between 2001 and 2010 were prospectively evaluated. The hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) was determined 5 days after the bleeding and repeated 5-7 days after maximal tolerated doses of nadolol and nitrates. Hemodynamic responders (HVPG \u2264 12 mm Hg or \u2265 20% decrease from baseline) were maintained on drugs and followed up with annual HVPG measurements. Forty-eight patients (47%) were hemodynamic responders. The median follow-up was 48 months (range, 2-108 months). Long-term HVPG evaluations could not be performed in eight patients (four deaths, two rebleedings, two follow-ups <1 year). Among the remaining 40 patients, hemodynamic response was maintained in 26 (65%) and lost in 14 (35%). There were no baseline differences between the two subgroups. However, 100% of alcoholic patients who remained abstinent maintained long-term response, compared with 36% of nonabstinent alcoholics and 50% of patients with viral cirrhosis. Patients with loss of hemodynamic response rebled more during follow-up and showed a higher incidence of death or liver transplantation.",

First, we developed a method to deliver the radiotracer safely into the stomach using soft gelatin capsules to avoid any significant exposure to the pharyngoesophageal region. Second, we performed pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses on time-radioactivity profiles in GI tissues and blood to calculate the gastric emptying and intestinal elimination rate constants and to estimate the fluid volume in the lumen of the small intestine from PET image analysis. This is the first study involving oral administration of a PET probe in humans, and the results demonstrate the high potential of PET technology to investigate the GI absorption and PK profiles of drugs in humans.",

    "26": "\u03b2-Adrenergic receptor (AR) blockers provide substantial clinical benefits, including improving overall survival and left ventricular (LV) function following myocardial infarction (MI), though the mechanisms remain incompletely defined. The transverse-tubule (T-tubule) system of ventricular myocytes is an important determinant of cardiac excitation-contraction function. T-tubule remodeling occurs early during LV failure. We hypothesized that \u03b2-AR blockers prevent T-tubule remodeling and thereby provide therapeutic benefits. A murine model of MI was utilized to examine the effect of \u03b2-AR blockers on T-tubule remodeling following LV MI. We applied the in situ imaging of T-tubule structure from Langendorff-perfused intact hearts with laser scanning confocal microscopy. We found that MI caused remarkable T-tubule remodeling near the infarction border zone and moderate LV remodeling remote from the MI. Metoprolol and carvedilol administered 6 d after MI for 4 wk each increased the T-tubule integrity at the remote and border zones. At the molecular level, both \u03b2-AR blockers restored border and remote zone expression of junctophilin-2 (JP-2), which is involved in T-tubule organization and formation of the T-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions. In contrast, \u03b2-AR blockers had no significant effects on caveolin-3 expression. In summary, our data show that \u03b2-AR antagonists can protect against T-tubule remodeling after MI, suggesting a novel therapeutic mechanism of action for this drug class. Preservation of JP-2 expression may contribute to the beneficial effects of metoprolol and carvedilol on T-tubule remodeling.", 
    "27": "Cocaine is used worldwide and considered a public health problem. Relapse from addiction is one of the difficulties faced by cocaine users, and in most cases according to the period of abstinence, users may present symptoms such as anxiety or depression. To evaluate the anxiety-like behavior induced by different periods, rats were treated for 7 days with cocaine 20 mg/kg, i.p., and 24 h, 7 and 21 days after drug withdrawal were submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the open field (OF) tests. In different protocol, propranolol (10 mg/kg, i.p.), ondansetron (4 mg/kg, i.p.) and buspirone (5 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered once after 24 h and 7 days of abstinence from cocaine to evaluate possible reversal or attenuation of the symptoms caused by cocaine withdrawal. EPM results showed a reduction in all parameters after 24 h and 7 days of the last exposure to cocaine, indicating anxiety-like behavior. In the OF test, 24 h and 7 days of abstinence showed increased locomotor activity, while in the withdrawal 21 days the animals not alter the locomotor activity. The administration of propranolol, ondansetron or buspirone after a 24 h abstinence period reduced the animals\u0301 anxiety in the EPM, and in the OF all drugs were able to reduce locomotor activity. After abstinence 7 d, the drugs reduced locomotor activity in the OF, in the EMP propranolol and ondansetron reversed the anxiogenic effect induced by cocaine. These results suggest that the treatment of anxyogenic effects of abstinence from cocaine is dependent on the period of the withdrawal.",

By utilizing the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heteromer identification technology on the live cell-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay platform, our studies in human embryonic kidney 293 cells have identified norepinephrine-dependent \u03b2-arrestin recruitment that was in turn dependent upon co-expression of \u03b1(1A)AR with CXCR2. These findings have been supported by co-localization observed using confocal microscopy. This norepinephrine-dependent \u03b2-arrestin recruitment was inhibited not only by the \u03b1(1)AR antagonist Terazosin but also by the CXCR2-specific allosteric inverse agonist SB265610. Furthermore, Labetalol, which is marketed for hypertension as a nonselective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist with \u03b1(1)AR antagonist properties, was identified as a heteromer-specific-biased agonist exhibiting partial agonism for inositol phosphate production but essentially full agonism for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment at the \u03b1(1A)AR-CXCR2 heteromer. Finally, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies with both receptors tagged suggest that \u03b1(1A)AR-CXCR2 heteromerization occurs constitutively and is not modulated by ligand. These findings support the concept of GPCR heteromer complexes exhibiting distinct pharmacology, thereby providing additional mechanisms through which GPCRs can potentially achieve their diverse biological functions. This has important implications for the use and future development of pharmaceuticals targeting these receptors.",

Although the ability of the metabolically activated form of NNK to generate DNA adducts is well established, little is known about the cellular pathways perturbed by NNK in its native state. In this study, we utilized stable isotope labeling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC), together with mass spectrometry, to assess the perturbation of protein expression in GM00637 human skin fibroblast cells upon NNK exposure. With this approach, we were able to quantify 1412 proteins and 137 of them were with significantly altered expression following NNK exposure, including the up-regulation of all subunits of the 20S proteasome core complex. The up-regulation of the 20S core complex was also reflected by a significant increase in 20S proteasome activities in GM00637, IMR90, and MCF-7 cells upon NNK treatment. Furthermore, the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) antagonist propranolol could attenuate significantly the NNK-induced increase in proteasome activity in all the three cell lines, suggesting that up-regulation of the 20S proteasome may be mediated through the \u03b2-AR. Additionally, we found that NNK treatment altered the expression levels of other important proteins including mitochondrial proteins, cytoskeleton-associated proteins, and proteins involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Further the effect of combination of both the drugs on spatial working memory and locomotor activity on rotarod was also evaluated. The biochemical estimation was done by measuring the lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione in brain tissue. The results indicate that carvedilol significantly potentiates the anticonvulsive activity of gabapentin in both the models of epilepsy. The combination of both the drugs has no effect on spatial working memory and locomotor activity. In addition carvedilol in combination with gabapentin significantly decreased the level of the lipid peroxidation and increased the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) in brain. So, the present study showed that carvedilol potentiates the anticonvulsive activity of gabapentin, which can be useful for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with hypertension.", 
    "54": "The use of fluorescent proteins, particularly when genetically fused to proteins of biological interest, have greatly advanced many flow cytometry research applications. However, there remains a major limitation to this methodology in that only total cellular fluorescence is measured. Commonly used fluorescent proteins (e.g., EGFP and its variants) are fluorescent whether the fusion protein exists on the surface or in sub-cellular compartments. A flow cytometer cannot distinguish between these separate sources of fluorescence. This can be of great concern when using flow cytometry, plate readers or microscopy to quantify cell surface receptors or other surface proteins genetically fused to fluorescent proteins. Recently developed fluorogen activating proteins (FAPs) solve many of these issues by allowing the selective visualization of only those cell surface proteins that are exposed to the extracellular milieu. FAPs are GFP-sized single chain antibodies that specifically bind to and generate fluorescence from otherwise non-fluorescent dyes ('activate the fluorogen'). Like the fluorescent proteins, FAPs can be genetically fused to proteins of interest. When exogenously added fluorogens bind FAPs, fluorescence immediately increases by as much as 20,000-fold, rendering the FAP fusion proteins highly fluorescent. Moreover, since fluorogens can be made membrane impermeant, fluorescence can be limited to only those receptors expressed on the cell surface. Using cells expressing beta-2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) fused at its N-terminus to a FAP, flow cytometry based receptor internalization assays have been developed and characterized. The fluorogen/FAP system is ideally suited to the study of cell surface proteins by fluorescence and avoids drawbacks of using receptor/fluorescent protein fusions, such as internal accumulation. We also briefly comment on extending FAP-based technologies to the study of events occurring inside of the cell as well.",

A genetic analysis of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in mice linked the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor to mechanical sensitization after opioid exposure. In humans, expansion of the area of mechanical hyperalgesia surrounding an experimentally induced lesion after the cessation of remifentanil infusion is a commonly used model of opioid hyperalgesia (remifentanil-induced postinfusion hyperalgesia, RPH). The purpose of our translational study was to test the hypothesis that the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol modulates the expression of RPH in humans. This double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was performed in 10 healthy human volunteers. During test sessions, intracutaneous electrical stimulation was used to generate areas of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia. The area of this sensitization was measured before, during, and after remifentanil infusion. Heat pain sensitivity was also followed. During one test session, subjects received propranolol infusion. We observed an average increase in the areas of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia to 141% of the baseline in subjects infused with remifentanil and placebo (P=0.00040). However, when remifentanil infusion was combined with propranolol, the area of secondary hyperalgesia after terminating remifentanil was not significantly different than the area before beginning the opioid infusion (P=0.13). Thermal hyperalgesia was not observed after remifentanil infusion. Propranolol infusion at the selected dose had minor hemodynamic effects. Concomitant infusion of propranolol with remifentanil prevented the expression of RPH. \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockade may be a useful pharmacological strategy for preventing hyperalgesia in patients exposed to opioids.",

Stressed and dysfunctional mitochondria exhibit an increase in large conductance mitochondrial membrane currents and a decrease in bioenergetic efficiency.

Here we show that the candidate ALS drug dexpramipexole (DEX; KNS-760704; ((6R)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-N6-propyl-2,6-benzothiazole-diamine) and cyclosporine A (CSA) inhibited increases in ion conductance in whole rat brain-derived mitochondria induced by calcium or treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, although only CSA inhibited calcium-induced permeability transition in liver-derived mitochondria. In several cell lines, including cortical neurons in culture, DEX significantly decreased oxygen consumption while maintaining or increasing production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). DEX also normalized the metabolic profile of injured cells and was protective against the cytotoxic effects of proteasome inhibition.

Yet, no previous studies have been conducted to compare the effectiveness of the two drugs. AIM. To compare the effectiveness parameters in independent groups of patients treated preventively with one of the pharmaceuticals from the study, the same protocol being applied in both cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The subjects selected for the study were patients with episodic migraine (according to 2004 International Headache Society criteria) who had undergone preventive treatment for the first time, with flunarizine (5 mg/day) or nadolol (20-40 mg/day). The main effectiveness variables (reduction in the number of seizures at four months of treatment and responder rates) were analysed. RESULTS. The study included 227 patients who intended to receive treatment: 155 with flunarizine (80.5% females; mean age: 38.3 \u00b1 12.1 years) and 72 with nadolol (63.8% females; mean age: 37.1 \u00b1 12.0 years). The mean number of seizures prior to treatment was 6.09 \u00b1 2.6 in the flunarizine group and 5.1 \u00b1 1.7 in the nadolol group (p = 0.0079); at four months of treatment it was 2.61 \u00b1 2.4 in the flunarizine group and 2.77 \u00b1 2.4 in the nadolol group (p = NS). Percentage of reduction of migraines: 55.2% with flunarizine and 50.4% with nadolol (p = NS). The responder rate was 69% with flunarizine and 67% with nadolol (p = NS). The excellent response rate (reduction in the number of seizures by 75% or more) was 52.2% with flunarizine and 36.1% with nadolol (p = 0.0077). Percentage of adverse side effects: 48.3% with flunarizine and 25% with nadolol (p = 0.0009). The satisfaction rate was similar in both groups, 68%. CONCLUSIONS. Both flunarizine and nadolol proved to be effective in the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. Flunarizine is used more often in our milieu and was less well tolerated.",

An international multicenter review of 43 children with cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) mutations and clinical manifestations of LQT syndrome without overlap of other SCN5A syndromes was undertaken to describe the clinical characteristics of LQT3 in children. Patients were aged 7.6 \u00b1 5.9 years at presentation and were followed for 4.7 \u00b1 3.9 years. There was significant intrasubject corrected QT interval (QTc) variability on serial electrocardiography. Forty-two percent presented with severe symptoms or arrhythmia and exhibited longer QTc intervals compared to asymptomatic patients. None of the 14 patients who underwent primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation received appropriate shocks in 41 patient-years of follow-up, while 2 of 6 patients who underwent secondary prevention ICD implantation received appropriate shocks in 30 patient-years of follow-up. Half of patients who underwent ICD implantation experienced inappropriate shocks or ICD-related complications. Mexiletine significantly shortened the QTc interval, and QTc shortening was greater in patients with longer pretreated QTc intervals. Two ICD patients with frequent appropriate ICD shocks showed immediate clinical improvement, with elimination of appropriate ICD shocks after mexiletine loading. In conclusion, severe symptoms are common in children with LQT3 and are associated with longer QTc intervals. ICD implantation is associated with significant morbidity. Mexiletine shortens the QTc interval, and it may be beneficial.",

Two years later, L.R. had disease relapse in the mediastinum and received two cycles of ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin) followed by etoposide and ifosfamide. She then received BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan) as a conditioning regimen and underwent autologous bone marrow transplant. Her post-transplant course was complicated by cytomegalovirus antigenemia, aspergillus pneumonia, and congestive heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%-25%. She was treated with an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and a beta-blocker (carvedilol) with improvement of her LVEF to 30%-35%. A follow-up chest x-ray showed an increase in the size of the anterior mediastinal adenopathy suspicious for relapse of lymphoma, and at the same time she was also found to be 5 weeks pregnant. Given her cardiomyopathy, significant obesity, poorly controlled diabetes, and cancer recurrence, L.R. was advised by her gynecologist that the pregnancy was very high risk and might not be viable. The oncologists advised her to terminate the pregnancy within the first trimester, as she needed salvage radiotherapy treatment to the mediastinum and chemotherapy treatments that might endanger the fetus. However, the patient decided to continue with the pregnancy. A multidisciplinary team-which included a cardiologist, oncologist, high-risk obstetrician, pharmacist, and nurse practitioner-was then involved to provide care during the pregnancy. A social worker was also solicited to help with home and financial issues because L.R. was a single mother with a 2-year-old son.

    "91": "Pannexin1 (Panx1), a protein related to the gap junction proteins of invertebrates, forms nonjunctional channels that open upon depolarization and in response to mechanical stretch and purinergic receptor stimulation. Importantly, ATP can be released through Panx1 channels, providing a possible role for these channels in non-vesicular signal transmission. In this study we expressed exogenous human and mouse Panx1 in the gap junction deficient Neuro2A neuroblastoma cell line and explored the contribution of Panx1 channels to cell-cell communication as sites of ATP release. Electrophysiological (patch clamp) recordings from Panx1 transfected Neuro2A cells revealed membrane conductance that increased beyond 0 mV when applying voltage ramps from -60 to +100 mV; threshold was correlated with extracellular K+, so that at 10 mM K+, channels began to open at -30 mV. Evaluation of cell-cell communication using dual whole cell recordings from cell pairs revealed that activation of Panx1 current in one cell of the pair induced an inward current in the second cell after a latency of 10-20 s. This paracrine response was amplified by an ATPase inhibitor (ARL67156, 100 \u03bcM) and was blocked by the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase (6.7 U/ml), by the P2 receptor antagonist suramin (50 \u03bcM) and by the Panx1 channel blocker carbenoxolone. These results provide additional evidence that ATP release through Panx1 channels can mediate nonsynaptic bidirectional intercellular communication. Furthermore, current potentiation by elevated K+ provides a mechanism for enhancement of ATP release under pathological conditions.",

Results show that SKF10047 inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by the K\u207a channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and the \u03c3-1 receptor antagonist N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-N-methyl-2-(dimethylamino)ethylamine (BD1047) blocked this phenomenon. The effects of SKF10047 on the evoked glutamate release were prevented by the chelating extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207aions and the vesicular transporter inhibitor bafilomycin A1. However, the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyl-oxyaspartate did not have any effect on the action of SKF10047. SKF10047 decreased the depolarization-induced increase in the cytosolic free Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration ([Ca\u00b2\u207a](C)), but did not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. Furthermore, the effects of SKF10047 on evoked glutamate release were prevented by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking the ryanodine receptors or the mitochondrial Na\u207a/Ca\u00b2\u207a exchange. In addition, conventional protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors abolished the SKF10047 effect on 4-AP-evoked glutamate release. Western blot analyses showed that SKF10047 decreased the 4-AP-induced phosphorylation of PKC and PKC\u03b1. These results show that \u03c3-1 receptor activation inhibits glutamate release from rat cortical nerve terminals. This effect is linked to a decrease in [Ca\u00b2\u207a](C) caused by Ca\u00b2\u207a entry through presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca\u00b2\u207a channels and the suppression of the PKC signaling cascade.",

Experiments conducted with this type of column through frontal analysis indicated that two types of interactions were occurring between R-propranolol and LDL, while only a single type of interaction was observed between S-propranolol and LDL. The first type of interaction, which was seen for both enantiomers, involved non-saturable binding; this interaction had an overall affinity (nK(a)) of 1.9 (\u00b10.1) \u00d7 10(5) M(-1) for R-propranolol and 2.7 (\u00b10.2) \u00d7 10(5) M(-1) for S-propranolol at 37 \u00b0C.

    "114": "Antihypertensive drugs reduce headache but it is unclear whether there are differences between drug classes. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) decrease variability in systolic blood pressure (SBPV) and stroke risk more than other classes, possibly due to decreased vascular tone. If so, there might be a correlation between drug-class effects on variability in SBP and on headache. We determined antihypertensive class effects on SBPV and headache during follow-up in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials. We determined pooled estimates of treatment effect on group variability in BP (variance ratio, VR) and on the odds ratio for headache (OR) by random-effects meta-analysis. Antihypertensive drugs reduced the incidence of headache compared to placebo (OR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.82, p < 0.0001, 198 comparisons, 43,672 patients), but there was significant heterogeneity between drug classes (p = 0.0007) with a greater effect of beta-blockers compared to placebo (VR = 0.49, 0.33-0.68, p < 0.0001, 16 trials) or all other drug classes (OR = 0.73, 0.62-0.85, p = 0.0002, 49 trials) and a lack of effectiveness of CCBs (vs. placebo-OR = 0.95, 0.79-1.15, 65 trials; vs. other drugs-OR = 1.19, 1.05-1.35, p = 0.009, 101 trials). Drug-class effects on headache were opposite to effects on variability in SBP (vs. other drugs: CCB-VR = 0.81, 0.71-0.85, p < 0.0001; beta-blocker VR = 1.17, 1.07-1.28, p < 0.0001), but were unrelated to differences in mean SBP. Antihypertensive drugs reduce headache but the effect differs between classes, corresponding to their effects on SBPV and the risk of stroke. This may partly be explained by consistent antihypertensive class effects on vascular tone in the peripheral (variability) and cerebrovascular circulations (headache).",

We compared the effect of nebivolol (5 mg/d) and the \u03b2(1)-selective antagonist metoprolol (100 mg/d) on glucose homeostasis and markers of fibrinolysis in 46 subjects with metabolic syndrome. Subjects underwent a frequently sampled IV glucose tolerance test after 3-week washout and placebo treatment and after randomized treatment with study drug. After 12-week treatment, nebivolol and metoprolol equivalently decreased systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate. Neither drug affected \u03b2-cell function, disposition index, or acute insulin response to glucose. Metoprolol significantly decreased the insulin sensitivity index. In contrast, nebivolol did not affect insulin sensitivity, and the decrease in sensitivity was significantly greater after metoprolol than after nebivolol (-1.5\u00b12.5\u00d710(-4)\u00d7min(-1) per milliunit per liter versus 0.04\u00b12.19\u00d710(-4)\u00d7min(-1) per milliunit per liter after nebivolol; P=0.03).

Metoprolol, but not nebivolol, increased F(2)-isoprostane concentrations. In summary, treatment with metoprolol decreased insulin sensitivity and increased oxidative stress and the antifibrinolytic plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in patients with metabolic syndrome, whereas nebivolol lacked detrimental metabolic effects. Large clinical trials are needed to compare effects of nebivolol and the \u03b2(1) receptor antagonist metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with hypertension and the metabolic syndrome.",

However, there is no information as to the role of these channels in responses to endogenous vasodilators. We used a molecular knockdown strategy, as well as pharmacological tools, to examine the hypothesis that Kv7.4 channels contribute to \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in the renal vasculature and underlie the vascular deficit in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed gene and protein expression of KCNQ1, KCNQ3, KCNQ4, KCNQ5, and Kv7.1, Kv7.4, and Kv7.5 in rat renal artery. Isoproterenol produced concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted renal arteries and increased Kv7 channel currents in isolated smooth muscle cells. Application of the Kv7 blocker linopirdine attenuated isoproterenol-induced relaxation and current. Isoproterenol-induced relaxations were also reduced in arteries incubated with small interference RNAs targeted to KCNQ4 that produced a \u224860% decrease in Kv7.4 protein level. Relaxation to isoproterenol and the Kv7 activator S-1 were abolished in arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats, which was associated with \u224860% decrease in Kv7.4 abundance. This study provides the first evidence that Kv7 channels contribute to \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in the renal vasculature and that abrogation of Kv7.4 channels is strongly implicated in the impaired \u03b2-adrenoceptor pathway in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

Medication data were captured through 1 year. The large majority of patients in the APTOR registry received statins at hospital discharge (89%) and remained on statins at 1 year (87%), a finding that was consistent across countries. Likewise, beta-blocker use was similar at discharge and 1 year (83 and 81%, respectively). There was large disparity in aspirin loading dose between countries, but the discharge maintenance dose was more consistent, with most receiving \u2264 100 mg (87%).

Even with European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, variations in practice patterns exist among ACS patients treated with PCI between the 14 European countries studied, including the use of proven therapies, as well as appropriate duration and dosing of antiplatelet regimens. Efforts are needed to further explain why such variation exists and to continue to improve adherence to ESC guidelines to improve patient care.", 
    "154": "Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is common, but neglected. We evaluated the prognostic implications of TR in a cohort of 756 patients with severe aortic regurgitation (AR). A cohort of 756 patients with AR was identified from our echocardiographic database. Chart reviews were performed. Survival as a function of TR severity was analysed. Of the 756 patients with severe AR, 264 (35%) had \u2265 2+ TR. Univariate correlates of TR were older age (P < 0.0001), female gender (P < 0.0001), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.0001), atrial fibrillation (P < 0.0001), presence of a pacemaker (P < 0.0001), higher PASP (P < 0.0001), presence of 3 or 4+ mitral regurgitation (P < 0.0001) and not being on a beta-blocker (P < 0.0001) or statins (P = 0.007). After adjusting for group differences, \u2265 2+ TR was an independent predictor of higher mortality (RR 1.47, P = 0.005). Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was independently associated with improved survival in patients with \u2265 2+ TR. (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.60, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, in severe AR patients, \u2265 2+ TR is independently associated with a higher mortality. The performance of AVR in these patients with \u2265 2+ TR is associated with a survival benefit. Development of \u2265 2+ TR in these patients is a marker of decompensation and should serve as an indication for AVR.",

In vivo glucose utilization was measured by applying the euglycemic clamp technique and the expression levels of insulin-signaling molecules in skeletal muscles were examined by western blotting. A bolus injection of CV-11974 improved the glucose infusion rate (GIR) of HFD-fed rats to the level of the control rats. Furthermore, restoration of impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) \u03b2, Akt phosphorylation at Ser\u2074\u2077\u00b3 and Thr\u00b3\u2070\u2078, and phosphorylation of the 160-kDa Akt substrate (AS160) in the skeletal muscles of HFD-fed rats were achieved by this treatment.

Patients with in-treatment SBP 130 mmHg or less (lowest quintile at last measurement) and SBP between 131 and 141 mmHg were compared with patients with in-treatment SBP at least 142 mmHg (median SBP at last measurement). In univariate analyses, compared with in-treatment SBP at least 142 mmHg, in-treatment SBP between 131 and 141 mmHg entered as a time-varying covariate identified patients with significantly lower risk of all events. In contrast, patients with SBP 130 mmHg or less had less reduction in MI, stroke and composite endpoint and no significant decrease in cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. In multivariate Cox analyses adjusting for baseline risk factors and randomized treatment as standard covariates and in-treatment diastolic BP, heart rate and Cornell product LVH as time-varying covariates, an in-treatment achieved SBP of 131 to 141 mmHg remained associated with a significantly decreased risk of MI, stroke and the LIFE composite endpoint. In contrast, patients who achieved a SBP 130 mmHg or less had no significant reduction in risk of MI, stroke or composite endpoint, had a trend to increased cardiovascular mortality [hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-1.81, P\u200a=\u200a0.078] and a statistically significant 37% increased risk of death from any cause (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.10-1.71, P\u200a=\u200a0.005).",

Tropical tick infestation limits the introduction of high-yield bovine varieties because they do not have immunity to the diseases transmitted by these ectoparasites. This tick is usually controlled with chemical acaricides but their indiscriminate use has created resistant populations. The discovery of new molecules that can be used for tick control is urgent. Based on the knowledge that octopamine, a biogenic amine analog to epinephrine, is central to the regulation of oviposition in several studied arthropods and that an imbalance in octopamine release causes sterility in a Drosophila model. Tyramine, octopamine and epinastine and 83 adrenergic compounds classified by their effect in the vertebrate systems were screened for their ability to block oviposition in Rhipicephalus microplus. Of these molecules, we found that 10 alpha-agonists, 3 alpha-antagonists, 5 beta-adrenergic agonists, 7 beta-antagonists and Norepinephrine were able to inhibit oviposition in this tick at pharmacological concentrations. Surprisingly, tyramine appears to be more potent than octopamine. The probable physiological causes of this inhibition are discussed. Our results suggest that although there are alpha adrenergic-like receptors in the tick, they do not behave in a manner completely analogous to their vertebrate counterparts.",

Electrocardiograms were read by 2 cardiologists at an independent core laboratory using the 2 Sokolow-Lyon criteria and the Cornell criteria. Left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography was defined as left ventricular mass index greater than 49.2 and greater than 46.7 g/m(2.7) in men and women, respectively. Sixty-nine percent of the population had left ventricular hypertrophy on echo, whereas 34% had left ventricular hypertrophy by any of the electrocardiographic criteria. Sensitivity by individual electrocardiographic criteria was 16.5% by Sokolow-Lyon-1, 19.3% by Sokolow-Lyon-2, and 24.7% by Cornell criteria, with specificity ranging from 89% to 92%. When using any of the 3 criteria, sensitivity increased to 40.4% with a decrease in specificity to 78.0%.

A heperin-filled catheter was inserted into the right femoral artery or into the left ventricle, and changes of blood pressure or cardiac function recorded by a Powerlab/4S instrument. Phentolamine or metoprolol were pre-injected to observe the possible role in autonomic nerve activity. After rats were sacrificed, plasma was collected and endogenous digitalis-like factors were measured with a commercial radioimmunoassay kit. The aortic, cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles were isolated and the activity of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase was measured as ouabain-sensitive ATP hydrolysis under maximal velocity conditions by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP. Unpaired Student's t test for two groups or analysis of variances (ANOVA) for multiple groups were used to compare the differences of the changes.",

Bolus injection of L-cysteine or beta- mercaptopyruvate also increased mean arterial pressure (P < 0.01), whereas hydroxylamine-a cystathionine beta synthase inhibitor decreased the arterial pressure (P < 0.01). Hydrogen sulfide and L-cysteine increased mean arterial pressure, left ventricular develop pressure and left-ventricle maximal rate of systolic and diastolic pressure; these functions were decreased by hydroxylamine (P < 0.01). Glibenclamide (a K(ATP) channel blocker) blocked the transient hypotensive effect, phentolamine (an alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker) blocked the hypertensive effect, and metoprolol (a selective beta 1 receptor blocker) blocked the positive inoptropic effect of central nervous system hydrogen sulfide. The endogenous digitalis-like factors in plasma were elevated (P < 0.01) after treatment with L-cysteine, association with decreasing Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in cardiac or aortic sarcolemmal vesicles (P < 0.01).

Gold nanoparticles was found to catalyze the CL reaction of luminol with N-bromosuccinimide in an alkaline condition. The CL signal was furtherly enhanced significantly when timolol maleate was presented in the reaction system. But timolol maleate alone inhibited the CL signal from luminol-N-bromosuccinimide reaction slightly. Under the selected conditions, the enhanced CL intensity was linearly related to timolol maleate concentration in the range of 0.01-5.0mg/L with a detection limit of 7.6 \u03bcg/L. The relative standard deviation was 2.7% for 11 repeated measurements of 0.1mg/L timolol maleate solution. The proposed method was applied to the determination of timolol maleate in eye drops and in spiked human urine. A discussion on the possible CL reaction mechanism was also presented.", 
    "187": "It is well accepted that ABCB1 plays a critical role in absorption, distribution and elimination of many xenobiotics and drugs. Only little is known about the regulation and function of ABCB1 during pregnancy. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate maternal, placental and foetal Abcb1 expression and function in pregnant rats after induction with rifampicin, dexamethasone, St. John's wort (SJW) or thyroxine. Wistar rats were orally treated with rifampicin (250 mg/kg), SJW (1.0 g/kg), thyroxine (9 \u03bcg/kg), dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) or 0.5% methylcellulose suspension (control) for 9 days during late pregnancy (each N = 5). Afterwards, organ mRNA expression and protein content of Abcb1a were determined. Tissue concentrations of the ABCB1 probe drug talinolol were measured after repeated administration of the drug (100 mg/kg, 9 days) and after induction with oral rifampicin (250 mg/kg, 9 days, N = 5). Abcb1 expression was substantially lower in foetal than in maternal organs. Abcb1 was significantly induced by SJW in the maternal jejunum and placenta, by dexamethasone in foetal brain and liver and by thyroxine in the placenta and maternal and foetal brain. Rifampicin induced Abcb1 in all maternal and foetal organs. However, organ distribution of talinolol was not influenced by comedication of rifampicin. In conclusion, maternal and foetal Abcb1 organ expression in pregnant rats is inducible by nuclear receptor agonists. Although rifampicin regulates maternal and foetal Abcb1 expression, organ distribution of talinolol remains unchanged most likely caused by the known inhibitory effect of rifampicin on Abcb1 function.",

    "189": "Extracellular accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that extracellular perfusion of A\u03b2 inhibits long-term potentiation (LTP), which is strongly related to memory in animal models. However, it has recently been proposed that intracellular A\u03b2 may be the first pathological change to occur in AD. Here, we have investigated the effect on LTP of intracellular injection of A\u03b2 (A\u03b2(1-40), A\u03b2(1-42)) into hippocampal pyramidal cells using patch-clamp technique. We found that injection of 1 nM A\u03b2(1-42) completely blocked LTP, and extracellular perfusion of a p38 MAPK inhibitor or a metabotropic glutamate receptor blocker reversed these blocking effects on LTP. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of different concentrations of A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) on LTP and showed that A\u03b2(1-40) required a 1,000-fold higher concentration to attenuate LTP than 1 nM A\u03b2(1-42). These results indicate that LTP is impaired by A\u03b2 injected into genetically wild-type neurons in the sliced hippocampus, suggesting an acute action of intracellular A\u03b2 on the intracellular LTP-inducing machinery.", 
    "190": "The widespread noradrenergic innervation in the brain promotes arousal and learning by molecular mechanisms that remain largely undefined. Recent work shows that the \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2(2)AR) is linked to the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA1 via stargazin and PSD-95 (Joiner ML, Lise MF, Yuen EY, Kam AY, Zhang M, Hall DD, Malik ZA, Qian H, Chen Y, Ulrich JD, Burette AC, Weinberg RJ, Law PY, El-Husseini A, Yan Z, Hell JW. EMBO J 29: 482-495, 2010). We now demonstrate that the \u03b2(2)AR plays a prominent role in long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a train of 900 stimuli at 5 Hz (prolonged theta-tetanus-LTP, or PTT-LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region in mice, which requires simultaneous \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation. Although PTT-LTP was impaired in hippocampal slices from \u03b2(1)AR and \u03b2(2)AR knockout (KO) mice, only \u03b2(2)AR-selective stimulation with salbutamol supported this PTT-LTP in wild-type (WT) slices, whereas \u03b2(1)AR-selective stimulation with dobutamine (+ prazosin) did not. Furthermore, only the \u03b2(2)AR-selective antagonist ICI-118551 and not the \u03b2(1)AR-selective antagonist CGP-20712 inhibited PTT-LTP and phosphorylation of GluA1 on its PKA site S845 in WT slices. Our analysis of S845A knockin (KI) mice indicates that this phosphorylation is relevant for PTT-LTP. These results identify the \u03b2(2)AR-S845 signaling pathway as a prominent regulator of synaptic plasticity.", 
    "191": "Heart failure (HF) is a common pathological end point for several cardiac diseases. Despite reasonable achievements in pharmacological, electrophysiological and surgical treatments, prognosis for chronic HF remains poor. Modern therapies are generally symptom oriented and do not currently address specific intracellular molecular signaling abnormalities. Therefore, new and innovative therapeutic approaches are warranted and, ideally, these could at least complement established therapeutic options if not replace them. Gene therapy has potential to serve in this regard in HF as vectors can be directed toward diseased myocytes and directly target intracellular signaling abnormalities. Within this review, we will dissect the adrenergic system contributing to HF development and progression with special emphasis on G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). The levels and activity of GRK2 are increased in HF and we and others have demonstrated that this kinase is a major molecular culprit in HF. We will cover the evidence supporting gene therapy directed against myocardial as well as adrenal GRK2 to improve the function and structure of the failing heart and how these strategies may offer complementary and synergistic effects with the existing HF mainstay therapy of \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonism.",

The hallucinations resolved only after discontinuation of this medication.Case 2 was a 62-year-old Caucasian man with an inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by cardiac arrest, who was successfully resuscitated and discharged from the hospital on metoprolol. About 18 months after discharge, he related to his physician that he had been seeing dead people at night. He related his belief that since he 'had died and was brought back to life', he was now seeing people from the after-life. Upon discontinuation of the metoprolol the visual disturbances resolved within several days.Case 3 was a 68 year-old Caucasian woman with a history of severe hypertension and depression, who reported visual hallucinations at night for years while taking metoprolol.

Timolol was loaded into contact lenses by soaking in drug/phosphate buffered saline solution, and the drug-loaded lenses were subsequently inserted in one of the eyes, with the other eye serving as control.

In addition, lenses with one-third of the drug loading as eye drops resulted in the similar IOP reduction, suggesting higher bioavailability for contact lenses compared to eye drops. Inclusion of vitamin E into the lenses did not improve the IOP reduction. The IOP in the untreated eye also decreased from baseline for eye drops (3.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.42 mmHg) but it remained relatively unchanged with treatments based on lenses, suggesting reduction in systemic absorption for delivery of drugs by contact lenses.",

    "201": "All patients had complete follow-up visits. A significant increase in mean IOP was found following drug discontinuation in the 2 groups. Mean change in IOP 8 weeks after discontinuation of the drug was +1.6\u00b11.2\u2009mmHg (10.3%\u00b18.0%) in the timolol XE group and +4.3\u00b11.6\u2009mmHg (+27.2%\u00b111.8%) in the latanoprost group. The change in the latanoprost group was significantly greater compared with that in the timolol XE group (P<0.0001). There was no significant difference in mean IOP between before drug discontinuation and at 8 weeks after drug resumption in any group.", 
    "202": "There was a significant increase in IOP from discontinuation of timolol XE and latanoprost. The hypotensive effect of latanoprost in the combined drug therapy is significantly greater compared with timolol XE.", 
    "203": "Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality. Noninvasive stress testing is rarely helpful in assessing risk, and for most patients there is no evidence that coronary revascularization provides more protection against perioperative cardiovascular events than optimal medical management. Patients likely to benefit from perioperative beta blockade include those with stable coronary artery disease and multiple cardiac risk factors. Perioperative beta blockers should be initiated weeks before surgery and titrated to heart rate and blood pressure targets. The balance of benefits and harms of perioperative beta-blocker therapy is much less favorable in patients with limited cardiac risk factors and when initiated in the acute preoperative period. Perioperative statin therapy is recommended for all patients undergoing vascular surgery. When prescribed for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, aspirin should be continued in the perioperative period.", 
    "204": "Despite the use of angiotensin blockers, chronic kidney diseases still progress. New therapeutic approaches aim to strengthen and to complete angiotensin blocker effects. Endothelin receptor antagonists, in addition to angiotensin blockers reduce blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in diabetic nephropathies but can induce fluid overload. A second therapeutic approach consists in preventing the development of interstitial renal fibrosis which is a prognostic factor of CKD. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) plays a major role in this process. Several molecules such as pirfenidone, microARN are in development to block TGF-beta or its downstream signaling pathways. Another approach aims to promote resolution of inflammation and renal repair Interesting experimental results were obtained with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and with methyl of bardoxolone in humans.", 
    "205": "In compensated cirrhosis, a threshold value of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \u226510\u2009mm\u2009Hg is required for the development of decompensation. However, whether the treatment of portal hypertension (PHT) can prevent the transition into development of ascites once this level has been reached is unclear. Our aim was to assess the relationship between changes in HVPG induced by \u03b2-blockers and development of ascites in compensated cirrhosis with severe PHT.", 
    "206": "Eighty-three patients without any previous decompensation of cirrhosis, with large esophageal varices and HVPG \u226512\u2009mm\u2009Hg were included. After baseline hemodynamic measurements nadolol was administered and a second hemodynamic study was repeated 1-3 months later.", 
    "207": "During 53\u00b130 months of follow-up, decompensation occurred in 52 patients (62%) and in 81% of them ascites was the first manifestation. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis a decrease in HVPG \u226510% was the best cutoff to predict ascites. As compared with nonresponders, patients with an HVPG decrease \u226510% had a lower probability of developing ascites (19% vs. 57% at 3 years, P<0.001), refractory ascites (P=0.007), and hepatorenal syndrome (P=0.027). By Cox regression analysis hemodynamic nonresponse was the best predictor of ascites. By stepwise logistic regression, development of ascites was independently associated with nonresponse, whereas refractory ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were not.", 
    "208": "In patients with compensated cirrhosis and large varices treated with \u03b2-blockers, an HVPG decrease \u226510% significantly reduces the risk of developing ascitic decompensation and other related complications such as refractory ascites or hepatorenal syndrome.",

    "210": "Experimental study.", 
    "211": "We studied 5 bottles each of 11 kinds of glaucoma drops.", 
    "212": "Density-based calculations of drop volume were assessed using 0.1 mg analytic balance. Viscosity was measured using rotational rheometery. Bottle tip diameter was measured using 0.05 mm Vernier calipers. Surface tension was measured using a Fisher Scientific (Ottawa, ON) tensiometer.", 
    "213": "For the American brand-name Timoptic XE, the average drop volume was 38 \u00b1 3.1 \u03bcL versus 24 \u00b1 1.5 \u03bcL of Timolol GFS (p < 0.0001). For the Canadian brand-name Timoptic XE, the average drop volume was 42 \u00b1 4.0 \u03bcL versus 25 \u00b1 2 \u03bcL of timolol maleate EX (p < 0.0001). The Canadian brand-name Timoptic drop volume was 28 \u00b1 1.4 \u03bcL versus 35 \u00b1 1.9 \u03bcL Apo-Timop (p < 0.01). At a 0.1 per second shear rate, the viscosity of Canadian Timoptic XE was 20 times higher than that of its generic equivalent, whereas the viscosity of American Timoptic XE differed from the generic by a factor of 100. The surface tension of Canadian Timoptic XE was 31% higher than that of the generic (p < 0.001), whereas the surface tension of American Timoptic XE was 21% higher than that of the generic (p < 0.001). The bottle tips of the Canadian and American Timoptic XE measured about 3.5 times larger than those of their generics.", 
    "214": "American and Canadian Timoptic XE eye drops vary significantly from the generics in drop volume, viscosity, surface tension, and bottle tip. Canadian brand-name Timoptic delivered significantly smaller drop volumes than generic Apo-Timop. Careful consideration should be given to drop viscosity and bottle design when generic ophthalmic products are evaluated for interchangeability and market entry.", 
    "215": "The present study evaluated the clinical benefits of a new therapeutic method of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) using an EnSite system for inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST).", 
    "216": "Six patients with debilitating IST underwent RFCA using EnSite. Using the beta-adrenergic blocker and agonist, the heart rate was controlled between 70 to 150 bpm before and after the RFCA. The areas of the breakout sites (BOSs) were clearly distinguished between those from the normal P-wave zones during rates of less than 100 bpm and those from more upper rate sites during rates of more than 100 bpm using the EnSite system, in accordance with the appearance of tall P-waves (tall P-wave zone) in the IST patients. This was selected as the target for ablation.", 
    "217": "After the RFCA, the BOSs observed during heart rates of more than 100 bpm moved completely from the tall P-wave zone to the normal P-wave zone in the IST patients. The total number of heart beats and average heart beat on the 24-h Holter monitoring decreased statistically from that before the RFCA to that after, and no adverse heart rate responses was observed after the RFCA. Before the RFCA, the brain natriuretic peptide was elevated, New York Heart Association functional class was worse, and there was an impaired exercise tolerance observed with exercise electrocardiogram testing. The RFCA for the IST significantly improved those parameters.", 
    "218": "This new therapeutic method for IST using EnSite is effective and produces clinical benefits.", 
    "219": "\u03b1-KTx toxin Tc32, from the Amazonian scorpion Tityus cambridgei, lacks the dyad motif, including Lys27, characteristic of the family and generally associated with channel blockage. The toxin has been cloned and expressed for the first time. Electrophysiological experiments, by showing that the recombinant form blocks Kv1.3 channels of olfactory bulb periglomerular cells like the natural Tc32 toxin, when tested on the Kv1.3 channel of human T lymphocytes, confirmed it is in an active fold. The nuclear magnetic resonance-derived structure revealed it exhibits an \u03b1/\u03b2 scaffold typical of the members of the \u03b1-KTx family. TdK2 and TdK3, all belonging to the same \u03b1-KTx 18 subfamily, share significant sequence identity with Tc32 but diverse selectivity and affinity for Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 channels. To gain insight into the structural features that may justify those differences, we used the recombinant Tc32 nuclear magnetic resonance-derived structure to model the other two toxins, for which no experimental structure is available. Their interaction with Kv1.3 and Kv1.1 has been investigated by means of docking simulations. The results suggest that differences in the electrostatic features of the toxins and channels, in their contact surfaces, and in their total dipole moment orientations govern the affinity and selectivity of toxins. In addition, we found that, regardless of whether the dyad motif is present, it is always a Lys side chain that physically blocks the channels, irrespective of its position in the toxin sequence.", 
    "220": "To evaluate the interaction of intraocular pressure(IOP)\u2013lowering medications with physiologic day and night changes in aqueous humor dynamics in participants with ocular hypertension.", 
    "221": "Thirty participants were enrolled in thisdouble-masked, randomized, crossover study. Each participant underwent aqueous humor dynamics measurements at baseline and at 2 weeks of dosing in random order with latanoprost in the evening and placebo in the morning, timolol maleate twice daily, and dorzolamide hydrochloride twice daily. Measurements included central corneal thickness by ultrasound pachymetry, anterior chamber depth by A-scan, seated and habitual IOP by pneumatonometry, blood pressure by sphygmomanometry,episcleral venous pressure by venomanometry,and aqueous flow by fluorophotometry. Outflow facility was assessed by fluorophotometry and by tonography. Uveoscleral outflow was mathematically calculated using the Goldmann equation.", 
    "222": "Latanoprost use significantly decreased IOP during the day and night. It increased daytime uveoscleral outflow by a mean (SD) of 0.90 (1.46) \u03bcL/min (P=.048), but a nighttime increase of 0.26 (1.10) \u03bcL/min (P=.47)did not reach statistical significance. Timolol use decreased IOP during the day by reducing aqueous flow by 25%. Dorzolamide use lowered IOP only at the noon measurement and reduced daytime aqueous flow by 16%. Neither dorzolamide nor timolol use added to the physiologic 47% reduction in nighttime aqueous flow.", 
    "223": "The daytime IOP-lowering effects of latanoprost are mediated by an increase in uveoscleral outflow,and those of timolol and dorzolamide are mediated by aqueous flow suppression. Nighttime physiologic changes in uveoscleral outflow limit the nighttime pharmacodynamic efficacy of latanoprost. Aqueous flow suppression with timolol and dorzolamide was ineffective in obtaining IOP lowering at night.", 
    "224": "There is extensive evidence that glucocorticoid hormones impair the retrieval of memory of emotionally arousing experiences. Although it is known that glucocorticoid effects on memory retrieval impairment depend on rapid interactions with arousal-induced noradrenergic activity, the exact mechanism underlying this presumably nongenomically mediated glucocorticoid action remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that the hippocampal endocannabinoid system, a rapidly activated retrograde messenger system, is involved in mediating glucocorticoid effects on retrieval of contextual fear memory. Systemic administration of corticosterone (0.3-3 mg/kg) to male Sprague-Dawley rats 1 h before retention testing impaired the retrieval of contextual fear memory without impairing the retrieval of auditory fear memory or directly affecting the expression of freezing behavior. Importantly, a blockade of hippocampal CB1 receptors with AM251 prevented the impairing effect of corticosterone on retrieval of contextual fear memory, whereas the same impairing dose of corticosterone increased hippocampal levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol. We also found that antagonism of hippocampal \u03b2-adrenoceptor activity with local infusions of propranolol blocked the memory retrieval impairment induced by the CB receptor agonist WIN55,212-2. Thus, these findings strongly suggest that the endocannabinoid system plays an intermediary role in regulating rapid glucocorticoid effects on noradrenergic activity in impairing memory retrieval of emotionally arousing experiences.", 
    "225": "(13) C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) spectroscopy was applied to the identification and characterization of carvedilol (1-(9H-carbazol-4-yloxy)-3-[2-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-ethylamino]-propan-2-ol) in pharmaceutical preparations. Solid-state spectra (standard linewidth and lack of signal multiplicity) of carvedilol indicate that its physical form is the same (freebase form II); no other polymorphic forms were detected. The spectra of excipients, recorded under the same conditions, were helpful in their identification. The differences in chemical shifts for tablets I-VI are insignificant and suggest that there are no strong intermolecular drug-excipient interactions. The drugs from six manufacturers contained the same amount (25\u2009mg) of the active substance per tablet; however, tablets differ in size and thus in the concentration of carvedilol. An attempt at quantitation of carvedilol in the dosage forms was made. The cross-polarization kinetics and other measurement parameters affecting the intensity and reproducibility of the spectra were determined. The results revealed a satisfying relationship between the composition of the tablets and the intensity of selected NMR signals. The (13) C CPMAS NMR technique was found to provide accurate quantification of drugs without any chemical preparation, as shown by the particular case of carvedilol's solid formulations.", 
    "226": "Virtually nothing is known about the effects on fetal physiology of xanthine oxidase inhibition. This is despite maternal treatment with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol being considered in human complicated pregnancy to protect the infant\u2019s brain from excessive generation of ROS.We investigated the in vivo effects of maternal treatment with allopurinol on fetal cardiovascular function in ovine pregnancy in late gestation. Under anaesthesia, pregnant ewes and their singleton fetus were instrumented with vascular catheters and flow probes around an umbilical and a fetal femoral artery at 118\u00b11 dGA (days of gestational age; termca. 145 days). Five days later, mothers were infused I.V. with either vehicle (n =11) or allopurinol (n =10). Fetal cardiovascular function was stimulated with increasing bolus doses of phenylephrine (PE) following maternal vehicle or allopurinol. The effects of maternal allopurinol on maternal and fetal cardiovascular function were also investigated following fetal NO blockade (n =6) or fetal \u03b21-adrenergic antagonism (n =7). Maternal allopurinol led to significant increases in fetal heart rate, umbilical blood flow and umbilical vascular conductance, effects abolished by fetal \u03b21-adrenergic antagonism but not by fetal NO blockade. Maternal allopurinol impaired fetal \u03b11-adrenergic pressor and femoral vasopressor responses and enhanced the gain of the fetal cardiac baroreflex. These effects of maternal allopurinol were restored to control levels during fetal NO blockade. Maternal treatment with allopurinol induced maternal hypotension, tachycardia and acid\u2013base disturbance. We conclude that maternal treatment with allopurinol alters in vivo maternal, umbilical and fetal vascular function via mechanisms involving NO and \u03b21-adrenergic stimulation. The evidence suggests that the use of allopurinol in clinical practice should be approached with caution."
