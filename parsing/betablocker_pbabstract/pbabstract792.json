    "0": "Several procedures have been reported for the assay of corticotrophine-releasing factor (CRF), each having its advantages and disadvantages. This report deals with an in vitro assay of ACTH releasing activity utilizing pituitary incubation combined with ACTH radioimmunoassay. Rat half pituitary was preincubated in 2 ml Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 0.2% glucose and 0.25 % BSA (KRBG-BSA) for 1.5 hr (45 min X 2). The medium was replaced by 1 ml KRBG-BSA and incubated for 30 min. Then the medium was again replaced by 1 ml KRBG-BSA or KRBG-BSA containing test materials and incubated for another 30 min. The amount of ACTH assayed by radioimmunoassay in the 2nd 30 min incubation was compared with in the 1st 30 min incubation and expressed as percentage. In ACTH radioimmunoassay, anti-ACTH serum was diluted to 1 : 1,500-3,000. The 125I-alpha 1-24ACTH-antibody system was not affected by lysine-vasopressin (LVP), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), rat's pituitary LH, GH and prolactin. Human 1-39ACTH was used as ACTH standard, and the dilution curve of incubation medium was paralleled with the standard curve. Repeatability of immunoassayable ACTH within-assay was 174 +/- 5.0 pg/tube (CV = 2.9%). A log dose-relationship was observed between the amounts of stalk median eminence extracts (SME ; NIAMDD) added to the incubation medium and its ACTH releasing activities. The sensitivity of this assay method was at least 0.1 SME or 10 mU of LVP and AVP. Using this method, it found that LVP, AVP, norepinephrine (100 ng/ml200 ng/ml) and 5-hydroxytryptophane (1 mug/ml) had ACTH releasing activities but LH-RH, TRH, glucagon, dopamine, phentolamine, propranolol, haloperidol, prostaglandin E1 and indomethacin did not affect the release of ACTH.", 
    "1": "1. Isolated brown fat cells from hamster respond to added catecholamines with a temporary increase in respiratory rate and an extended lipolysis. 2. From experiments with catecholamines and alpha and beta-blockers, the receptors of these cells are classified as beta according to classical definition. 3. Norepinephrine induces a rapid increase in adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels which parallels in time the stimulated respiration. Maximal adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels are reached within 1-3 min and are followed by a continuous decline. 4. Parallel to the catecholamine-induced respiration and lipolysis there is a pronounced drop in ATP levels. This energy depletion could be reversed by addition within 5 min after norepinephrine of the beta-blocker propranolol. 5. The nucleotide pattern in isolated hamster brown fat cells after norepinephrine addition was mimicked in experiments with isolated hamster brown fat mitochondria. From these experiments it is concluded that a high ratio of AMP and ADP over ATP decreases the respiratory rate when endogenous free fatty acids are oxidized.", 
    "2": "In slowly secreting submandibular glands of dogs, a sympathetic effect on myoepithelial cells was demonstrated as an acceleration of the flow, followed by retardation, on short-lasting sympathetic stimulation, particularly after beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drugs.", 
    "3": "Isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were highly potent in decreasing the triglyceride levels of the splenic lymphoid cells from guinea-pigs in vitro, while they were quite inert upon the inguinal lymph node cells.", 
    "4": "It is proposed that the development of ventricular fibrillation in the context of ischaemic heart-disease and myocardial infarction can be related to accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3',5' monophosphate (A.M.P.) in the ischaemic zone. The known electrophysiological and metabolic actions of cyclic A.M.P. are consonant with the hypothesis, which also provides a framework for the better understanding of the action of antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "5": "Insulin secretory responses were measured in air-breathing puppies given epinephrine, and compared with insulin responses during acute hypoxia. In puppies with oxygen deficiency, insulin levels declined, whereas during epinephrine infusion, they remained stable or increased slightly. When glucose was given during phentolamine administration, insulin levels rose more in the epinephrine-treated animals than in the hypoxic animals, despite similar blood glucose levels. Theophylline-induced insulin release was increased by epinephrine, but inhibited by hypoxia. When the beta adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol, was given with the epinephrine, the insulin response to theophylline was markedly reduced and similar to that observed during hypoxia. Control studies with propranolol showed no effect of this agent on glucose-induced insulin release. Isoproterenol infusion caused elevated insulin levels during air ventilation but this response was suppressed by hypoxia. From these data, we have concluded that the difference between hypoxia and epinephrine can be explained by a reduced ability of catecholamines to stimulate the beta adrenergic receptor during hypoxia. We hypothesize that this effect leads to an unmodulated alpha adrenergic inhibition of insulin release.", 
    "6": "Alanine and glutamine formation and release were studied using the intact epitrochlaris preparation of rat skeletal muscle. Epinephrine reduced the release of alanine and glutamine in a concentration-dependent manner. Measurable inhibition was observed at 10(-9) M epinephrine, and maximal inhibition was obtained at 10(-5) M. Norepinephrine also reduced alanine and glutamine formation and release but the concentration required for maximal inhibition was approximately 100-fold greater than for epinephrine. Isoproterenol (beta agonist), but not phenylephrine (alpha agonist), reproduced the effects of epinephrine, and propranolol (beta antagonist), but not phentolamine (alpha antagonist), blocked the effect of the catecholamine. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate reproduced the effects of epinephrine and theophylline potentiated the effect of submaximal concentrations of the hormone. Glucagon and prostaglandin E2 had no observable effect on amino acid release. Insulin did not modify the inhibition of alanine and glutamine release produced by epinephrine. Alanine and glutamine formation from added precursor amino acids was unaffected by epinephrine or cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate. Epinephrine reduced alanine formation in muscles obtained from diabetic rats or animals treated with thyroxine or cortisone. These findings indicate that physiological levels of catecholamines reduce alanine and glutamine formation and release from skeletal muscle. This effect is mediated by a beta-adrenergic receptor and the adenylate cyclase system and can be accounted for by an inhibition of muscle protein degradation.", 
    "7": "In a double blind trial in 11 control subjects and 12 bronchitic patients against an inert control oxprenolol produced significant worsening in airways obstruction in 6 control and in 7 patients. There was marked individual variation in response and no way was found to predict the susceptible subjects. Objective measurement of indices of airways obstruction and the effects of oxprenolol on them is essential where there is significant respiratory impairment. Great care must continue to be exercised since a significant proportion of bronchitic patients will be adversely affected by this drug.", 
    "8": "The effect of insulin-induced hypoglycemia on the blood levels of catecholamines and renin activity has been studied in five patients with moderate hypertension before and after treatment for 3 - 8 months with penbutolol (PEN) 20 - 30 mg twice daily. Penbutolol caused no change in fasting blood glucose level. Insulin o.1 IU per kg body weight i.v. reduced blood glucose concentration by approximately 50 per cent after 30 - 45 min, both before and during treatment with penbutolol. Hypoglycemia prior to medication was accompanied by a marked increase in the production of adrenaline and a minor increase of noradrenaline in all five patients. During treatment the response of adrenaline to hypoglycemia was reduced in four patients and the data was inconclusive in one. Basal renin activity was rather low in three patients, within the normal range in one and relatively high in one. Before penbutolol the hypoglycemia-induced increase in catecholamine production caused no change in plasma renin activity in the three patients with low basal levels, whereas a marked increase was observed in the other two. During medication plasma renin activity remained unchanged on induction of hypoglycemia regardless of the catecholamine response. Despite the marked increase in plasma adrenaline following insulin-induced hypoglycemia, no statistically significant increase in pulse rate was recorded.", 
    "9": "The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine and morphine on the stomach motility were determined in in situ experiments. 5-Hydroxytryptamine and morphine inhibited stomach motility of unanaesthetized cats but did produce a slight contraction of the stomach of anaesthetized cats. In unanaesthetized rabbits, 5-hydroxytryptamine caused a contraction, followed by an inhibition of motility, and morphine depressed motility. The 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contraction is a direct action on smooth muscle and the inhibition of spontaneous movement due to 5-hydroxytryptamine may be, in part, mediated through catecholamine-release and in part, result from paralysis of the receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine in the cholinergic nerves in the stomach. In anaesthetized rabbits, 5-hydroxytryptamine produced contraction and morphine had no effect. In unanaesthetized guinea pigs, 5-hydroxytryptamine caused a contraction and morphine abolished spontaneous movement of the stomach. In anaestetized guinea-pigs, 5-hydroxytryptamine caused contraction and morphine produced no effect. The 5-hydroxytryptamine-induced contraction of the guinea pig stomach is indirect. From these results it is concluded that the differences in the modes of actions of 5-hydroxytryptamine and morphine on gastric motility are related to differences in species and experimental conditions such as anaesthesia.", 
    "10": "In helically-cut strips of canine cerebral arteries, the dose-response curve of serotonin was not influenced by 10(-7) M phentolamine but was slightly moved to the right and downward at 10(-6) M. The contractile response to serotonin was unaffected by cocaine (3 X 10(-6)M), atropine (10(-6) M) and propranolol (10(-6) M). The addition of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ergotamine and methysergide caused a dose-dependent contraction. Treatment with LSD (10(-9) and 10(-8) M), ergotamine (10(-10) to 10(-8) M) and methysergide (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) shifted the dose-response curve of serotonin to the right and downward in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of methysergide was reversed by washing, while that of ergotamine was not reversed. Apparent pA2 values of LSD, ergotamine and methysergide were 9.17, 9.63 and 7.92, respectively. Contractile responses to 20 mM K+ were not significantly influenced by these blocking agents even in the highest concentrations used. It may be concluded that an alpha-adrenergic mechanism is not involved in the genesis of serotonin-induced contractions and that serotonin acts directly on serotonergic receptors in canine cerebral arteries.", 
    "11": "Plasma concentrations of propranolol and practolol were measured in patients with coeliac disease and normal subjects. The mean plasma propranolol concentration in the coeliac patients was higher throughout the period of study, the differences being significant at one, six, and eight hours. The plasma concentration profile of practolol in the coeliacs followed a similar pattern but lagged behind that of the normal subjects. A possible reason for these differences is an alteration in the rate of drug diffusion across the atrophic mucosa of the upper jejunum in coeliac disease. Analysis of the results of the propranolol study suggests that an increase in the rate of absorption combined with saturation of first pass extraction may account for the increased plasma concentrations of unchanged propranolol found in coeliac disease. These abnormalities of drug absorption do not appear to be related to the duration of treatment with a gluten free diet.", 
    "12": "Furosemide, administered intravenously (50 mg/kg) to guinea pigs, caused an increase in the sodium concentration and a decrease in the potassium concentration of endolymph, and a fall in the endolymphatic potential. The furosemide-induced electrolyte changes were prevented by pretreatment of five guinea pigs with propranolol given intravenously (2 mg/kg). The fall in the endolymphatic potential was not prevented by propranolol. Local administration of furosemide to the perilymphatic or endolymphatic space caused a fall in the endolymphatic potential, but had no effect upon the concentrations os sodium and potassium of endolymph. These studies provide additional information suggesting the mutual independence of the endolymphatic potential and sodium and potassium concentration gradients.", 
    "13": "This study evaluates the effect of propranolol on the echocardiogram of 8 patients with late systolic mitral value prolapse. Echocardiograms were performed with the patients on no medication and again while on oral propranolol therapy. Propranolol caused a statistically significant increase in left ventricular volume; however, neither the echocardiographic pattern nor the timing of mitral valve prolapse was altered by propranolol. These findings suggest that factors in addition to left ventricular volume play a role in regulating valvular dysfunction in this condition.", 
    "14": "Ganglion cells exist in muscle arterioles. To determine the role of these intrinsic neurons in postcontraction vasodilation, isolated dog gracilis muscles were studied. A single twitch elicited vasodilation, but no vasodilator metabolites appeared in the venous effluent. Contraction at 2/s lowered resistance within 1 s whereas dilator metabolites were not demonstrable in the effluent until 15-20 s. During contraction the magnitude and time course of vasodilation were the same during constant and variable flow, and at various values of PaO2 and PVO2. In contrast, resistance was strongly correlated with flow and PO2 during recovery. Some resting muscles were perfused with venous blood from contracting donors. The rate of metabolic vasodilation in recipient muscles was about 10 times less than the rate of vasodilation in the donors. Lidocaine and procaine blocked postcontraction vasodilation but did not influence postocclusion vasodilation, metabolic vasodialtion, or autoregulation. The degree of block was the same in acutely and chronically denervated muscles. The effect of local anesthetics could not be accounted for by properties of skeletal or vascular smooth muscles.", 
    "15": "1) intrinsic neurons initiate postcontraction vasodilation; 2) metabolites account for sustained vasodilation during recovery.", 
    "16": "To assess in the intact ventricle the steady-state influence of several mechanical variables on the extent of left ventricular midwall circumferential shortening, a pressure servo system was utilized in isolated canine hearts. The system permits continuous monitoring of ventricular volume and control of diastolic and systolic pressures. After determination of the diastolic volume at zero filling pressure (V0), a series of variably preloaded or afterloaded contractions were generated including the isovolumic state. Contractile state was manipulated in a positive (calcium, 12-18 mg/100 ml; norepinephrine, 0.4-1.4 mug/min) or negative (propranolol, 0.12-0.50 mg/min) direction. Force and length terms derived for a thick-walled sphere were expressed per cross-sectional area of muscle and length, respectively, calculated at V0. For any preload, an inverse linear (r greater than 0.96) force-shortening relation was obtained, and each line was identified by its slope and isovolumic load (sigma0). Both slope and sigma0 increased with positive inotropic agents (vis-a-vis propranolol) or increments in preload. Thus, in the intact ventricle an inverse linear relation characterizes the force-shortening relation with the amount of shortening determined by initial fiber length, afterload, and the contractile state of the myocardium.", 
    "17": "Infusion of isoproterenol intravenously in normal dogs at rates of 0.10 or 0.018 mug/min per kg body wt increased renin secretion; at the lower infusion rate arterial pressure (AP) and renal blood flow (RBF) were unchanged. Isoproterenol was also infused into the renal artery in normal dogs at 0.10 mug/min per kg; renin secretion increased in association with an increase in RBF but AP was unchanged. Plasma K concentration was consistently decreased in all three of the above experiments and because hypokalemia is known to increase renin release isoproterenol was not infused intrarenally at the lower rate; the decrease in plasma K level precluded relating the entire response in renin release to isoproterenol. Intrarenal infusion of propranolol at 0.05 mg/kg per h in Na-depleted dogs decreased renin secretion whereas intravenous infusion at the same dose failed to alter renin release. Intrarenal infusion of propranolol at this rate in Na-depleted dogs with a denervated, nonfiltering kidney also decreased renin release. In contrast, intrarenal infusion of phentolamine or phenoxybenzamine in normal dogs failed to alter renin secretion in doses that blocked alpha-adrenergic receptors. These experiments provide strong evidence for an intrarenal beta-adrenergic receptor that mediates renin release, and it seems likely from the experiment in the denervated, nonfiltering kidney that the receptor is located in the juxtaglomerular cells.", 
    "18": "The effect of stimulating the sympathetic innervation to rat submaxillary gland on ductal transport of Na, K, and water and on transepithelial PD was tested in the main excretory duct during perfusion through its lumen. Stimulation of the sympathetic nerve, supramaximally, caused a decrease of 30-40% in net flux of Na from, and of K to, the lumen in ducts perfused with medium containing Na and K in isotonic concentrations. Net flux of water was unaffected. Transductal PD decreased by about 30% during supramaximal stimulation. Changes in PD and net cation fluxes were reversible. These effects of supramaximal stimulation of the sympathetics on ductal transport resemble those reported to occur after large doses of isoproterenol and suggest an adrenergic secretomotor innervation to the ducts. However, changes in PD evoked by supramaximal stimulation of the sympathetic nerve could not be suppressed with propranolol, but were with phenoxybenzamine, indicating that alpha-adrenergic receptors are primarily involved in mediating at least the electrical responses of duct cells to sympathetic nerve stimulation.", 
    "19": "To delineate the mechanism through which vasoactive compounds alter intestinal oxygen consumption and to determine the pharmacological nature of the receptors involved, we quantitated the effects of vasoconstrictors on arteriovenous oxygen difference and on vascular resistance in isolated constant-flow perfused canine small bowel. Norepinephrine (NE) and sympathetic stimulation (SS) increased vascular resistance and depressed O2 extraction. These effects were not altered by beta-blockade, but were abolished by alpha-blockade. Since capillary filtration coefficients at constant-pressure perfusion and 86Rb extraction at constant flow are reported to diminish during NE and SS, it follows that these agents reduce O2 extraction by an alpha-adrenergic closure of precapillary sphincters. Vasopressin had similar effects which were not affected by adrenergic blocking agents. Epinephrine (Epi) in high doses or after propranolol produced the same effects as NE and SS. By contrast, Epi in low doses increased O2 and 86Rb extraction. This response to low doses of Epi was not affected by phentolamine, but was reversed by propranolol. We conclude that Epi in high doses or after propranolol depresses intestinal O2 extraction by the same mechanism as NE and SS, but the mechanism through which Epi increases intestinal O2 extraction is unclear.", 
    "20": "Antisera against propranolol were produced in rabbits immunized with propranolol conjugated to bovine serum albumin. The antiserum against dl-propranolol recognized both d- and l-propranolol to the same degree. However, antiserum against l-propranolol was able to discriminate the l-propranolol selectively. The antisera were used to develop radioimmunoassays for dl-propranolol and l-propranolol. The assay can detect as little as 10 pg of propranolol. Metabolites of propranolol do not interfere with the assay unless concentrations are very high. Serum and heart levels of l-propranolol and the d-isomer were determined in the rat after i.v. injection (1 mg/kg) of dl-propranolol. l-Propranolol declines rapidly in the blood after the injection. Concomitantly, there is a rapid accumulation of l-propranolol by the heart. The d-form of propranolol remains in the blood and is metabolized rapidly as reflected by a shorter half-life (23.8 minutes) than the one found for l-propranolol (5.20 minutes).", 
    "21": "In monoamine oxidase-inhibited dogs whose peripheral dopa decarboxylase was inhibited with MK-486, L-dopa (K mg/kg i.v.) caused significant hypotension and bradycardia. In addition, reflex bradycardia but not pressor responses to norepinephrine were markedly enhanced by the drug. Similar results were obtained after intracerebroventricular administration of L-dopa (0.5 mg/kg) in monoamine oxidase-inhibited dogs not receiving MK-486. Proparnolol prevented the bradycardia caused by L-dopa but was without effect on the reflex facilitation. Both atropine and phentolamine had no effect on L-dopa bradycardia but prevented the facilitatory effect on reflexes. Inhibition of both peripheral and central dopa decarboxylase with Ro 4-4602 prevented all the effects of L-dopa. Infusions of dopamine which had obvious cardiovascular effects had no effect on reflex responses to norepinephrine. It is concluded that L-dopa, after decarboxylation, causes a centrally mediated enhancement of reflex vagal bradycardia. Pharmacological analysis of this enhancement suggests that this effect appears to be a result of central alpha receptor stimulation.", 
    "22": "Propranolol enhanced the anaphylaxis reaction more than the reaction to histamine and mecholyl in inbred strain guinea pigs. These results suggest the presence of beta receptors on mast cells and that there are genetic differences in the reaction to mediators and antigens among these strains of guinea pigs.", 
    "23": "The present results indicate that in 3-4-weeks-old puppies propranolol induces a significant depression of cardiovascular function expressed by a decrease in heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output, and an increase in systemic vascular resistance, in doses beyond beta-blocking levels. In contrast, practolol, in the same dose range, did not induce further cardio-circulatory depression, as shown by levels of heart rate, myocardial contractility, and cardiac output similar to the values obtained with beta-blocking doses of this agent. The cardio-depressant activity observed in puppies with doses of propranolol beyond blocking levels is thought to be due to direct negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of this agent, not related to influences on beta receptor sites. Such effect not observed with practolol at doses well beyond beta-blocking levels suggests that this drug exerts a more selective influence on cardiac sympathetic beta receptors.", 
    "24": "The effect of PGE1and PGA1 intravenous infusion (2/mug/min) on plasma glucose and glucagon levels was investigated in normal, sympathectomized and propranolol-treated rats. PGE1 infusion significantly increased glucose and glucagon levels, while PGA1 had no effect. Since the dose of PGE1 used in this study was able to reduce the arterial blood pressure by about 20%, the possibility that PGE1 acted indirectly through a reflex sympathetic overactivity was tested. The increases in plasma glucagon induced by PGE1 occurred also in sympathectomized or in beta-blocked animals. Thus, it was possible to exclude a sympathetic mediation or a direct stimulation of pancreatic beta-receptors as a likely mechanism of PGE1 action.", 
    "25": "An expression representative of the rate of change of ventricular power during ejection was derived. The primary advantages of the expression are its theoretical value and its ability to characterize ventricular performance. The rate of change of ventricular power, measured during ejection, is virtually free of assumptions. It has a fluid dynamic as well as a physiological meaning. It serves in an integrative fashion by combining terms previously shown to be of functional significance. Studies in dogs show that it reflects alterations of the inotropic state yet is relatively independent of alterations of preload or afterload. In nine dogs isoproterenol caused the peak rate of change of power to increase from (10 +/- 2) X 10(8) to (15 +/- 3) X 10(8) dynes-cm. sec.-2 (mean +/- S.E.) (P less than 0.01). Propranolol produced a reduction from (10 +/- 2) X 108 to (6 +/- 1) X 10(8) dynes-cm. sec.-2 (P less than 0.001). An increased afterload induced by angiotensin caused no change of the peak rate of change of power. Augmentation of the preload with dextran, which caused a 40 per cent increase of the end-diastolic volume, produced a statistically insignificant increase of the peak rate of change of power from (12 +/- 3) X 10(8) TO (16 +/- 4) X 10(8) dynes-cm. sec.-2 The rate of change of ventricular power, measured during ejection, therefore appears to be a useful and meaningful indicator of ventricular performance that has many desirable characteristics.", 
    "26": "A study has been made of the pupillary and intraocular pressure responses of conscious rabbits to daily topical applications of submaximal doses of epinephrine. On the first day, epinephrine caused rapid pupil dilation which preceded a prolonged -ecrease of intraocular pressure. On the second and subsequent days, the application of the same dose of epinephrine increased the duration of the pupillary response and caused a biphasic pressure response in all treated eyes; an initial increase of intraocular pressure lasting two to four hours followed by decrease of intraocular pressure below the initial value which lasted for more than twenty-four hours. The beta-receptor antagonist, propranolol, and the alpha-receptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, caused small and large reductions, respectively, in the hypertensive response to epinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine, but not propranolol, also inhibited the pupil dilation and the hypotensive response to epinephrine. Topical administration of phenoxybenzamine strongly inhibited the hypertensive response to epinephrine but left unaffected the pupillary response.", 
    "27": "Three families with the prolongation Q-T interval are described. Two demonstrated the nonsex-linked dominant mode of inheritance of the condition without neural deafness (the Romano-Ward syndrome). Family A had four affected members in three generations. Family B had three affected members in two generations, but the parents of the affected children were distant relatives. Family C had five affected members in three generations. Of the nine living affected members, seven were asymptomatic and never experienced syncope. The remaining two, aged 7 and 9 years, respectively, had multiple syncopal attacks. Of three affected members who died, two had electrocardiograms before death. The thirds, an apparently healthy boy of 14 years, had a single syncopal attack 13 months before he died in his sleep. The nature of the dysrhythmia causing syncope was documented in two cases. One of the affected children was treated successfully with a permanent demand pacemaker and propranolol, the other with propranolol alone. The electrophysiologic findings and the management of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are discussed.", 
    "28": "1 The effects of beta-adrenoceptor blockade on the metabolic responses to isoprenaline have been studied in an in vitro system of isolated fat cells and in six normal subjects. 2 The inhibitory effects of varying concentrations of acebutolol, practolol and propranolol on free fatty acid (FFA) release produced by isoprenaline (10(-7) M) were compared in isolated fat cells prepared from rat epididymal adipose tissue. Acebutolol and practolol, at equimolar concentrations, showed a similar inhibitory effect whilst propranolol was approximately 100 times more potent then either drug. At 10(-5)M concentration of propranolol, lipolysis was virtually abolished whilst at the same molar concentration, acebutolol and practolol halved the response. 3 Six healthy volunteers received three successive 15 min intravenous isoprenaline challenges (0.03 mug kg-1 min-1) per individual experiment. The first acted as a control whilst the following two were given either after single oral doses of placebo, acebutolol or practolol. The mean (+/- s.e. mean) basal FFA level was 0.77 +/- 0.06 mE1/1 and subsequent resting values after the administration of placebo or beta-adrenoceptor blocker were not significantly different. 4 Acebutolol inhibited the respective mean rises in FFA, produced by both post-control isoprenaline challenges, by (mean +/- s.e. mean) 70 +/- 4% and 84% +/- 5%. The comparable figures for practolol were 33 +/- 15% and 24 +/- 20%. The higher serum concentration of acebutolol produced greater inhibition but correlation of log serum concentration of the drug with percentage inhibition of FFA rise did not achieve significance. 5 Administration of isoprenaline, acebutolol or practolol did not significantly alter serum glucose, triglyceride or cholesterol levels. 6 Acebutolol and practolol effectively blocked the isoprenaline-induced tachycardia. The degree of blockade produced by practolol was greater than its inhibitory effect on FFA release. The diatolic fall in blood pressure in response to isoprenaline was abolished by acebutolol suggesting that its beta-adrenoceptor blocking action encompasses peripheral vascular sites. The comparable effect with practolol was a partial inhibition of the diastolic fall.", 
    "29": "In 95 feline experiments it was established that coronary artery occlusion does not affect the Strophantin lethal dose, but it increases the sensitivity to the arrhythmogenic effect of the cardiac glycoside after 24-48 hours. Premedication of intact animals with such a beta-adrenergic blocking agent as Anapriline (Inderal) significantly increases the toolerance of Strophantin while the stimulation of the beta-adrenergic structures with Isadrine, on the contrary, decreases the arrhythmogenic and lethal dose of Strophantin. In coronary circulation disorders the pharmacological block of the adrenergic heart innervation did not produce any significant reduction of the sensitivity to the cardiac glycoside.", 
    "30": "50 patients with stenocardias in persisting arterial hypertension, of them 33 manifest coronary diseases, were orally treated with doses of propranolol up to 400 mg/die during a longer period. In the majority of the cases a good to very good therapeutic effectivity was to be proved in hypertension as well as in chronic ischaemic heart disease. The own favourable results of the treatment justify the estimation that proporanolol may be regarded as therapeutic remedy of choice in patients with simultaneous hypertension and chronic ischaemic heart disease. Moreover, a collective of 45 patients with different cardiovascular diagnoses under the new selective beta-receptor blocker Bonnecor (practolol) was observed. It is reported on first experiences in the sense of an intermediate information.", 
    "31": "The effects of bunaftine (Meregon), quinidine, ajmaline, procainamide, xylocaine and propranolol have been investigated on glycolysis and oxygen consumption of rabbit heart and on the metabolic rate of trained rats. Quinidine, bunaftine and ajmaline stimulated glycolysis, procainamide was inactive while xylocaine and propranolol inhibited it. Myocardial oxygen consumption was reduced by quinidine and bunaftine only at high concentrations. However quinidine at 1-10(5) g/ml showed stimulating effect. Ajmaline and procainamide were inactive; xylocaine had a weak stimulating effect at 1-10(-6), propranolol had a stimulating effect at 3-10(-5) and 1-10(6) while it had an inhibiting effect at 1-10(-4) and 5-10(-3). With the exception of xylocaine and propranolol, which inhibited metabolic rate of trained animals, all the other drugs were inactive. In view of these findings, the mechanism of action of anti-arrhythmic drugs is discussed and it is suggested that the metabolic changes they induce are to be considered as secondary or toxic effects, the main site of action being the myocardial cell membrane.", 
    "32": "The influence of propranolol (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) and of D,L-4-(2-hydroxy-3-isopropylamino-propoxy)-indol-hydrochloride (pindolol, LB 46) (0.10, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg) on the responses of plasma potassium levels of anaesthetized dogs to slow i.v. infusions of adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline (5 mug/kg-min-1) was studied. Adrenaline and noradrenaline infusions regularly evoked a dual response (hyperkaliemia followed by hypokaliemia), whereas isoprenaline caused either similar effects or only a decrease of plasma potassium. Propranolol abolished the hypokaliemic phase of the responses to adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline; the lower dose used had no effect on the primary increase in plasma potassium, but the dose of 1.0 mg/kg modified this part of the response, which was reduced and became less steep. Pindolol antagonized in a dose dependent way the hypokaliemic phase of the responses to adrenaline, noradrenaline and isoprenaline, but did not interfere with the early rise in plasma potassium, thus being more specific than propranolol. It is concluded that the secondary decrease in plasma potassium is due to an activation of beta-receptors, whereas the initial increase is caused by alpha-receptor stimulation. Propranolol shows, in the 1.0 mg/kg dose, some alpha-blocking activity, thus contrasting with pindolol, which is devoid of this effect and therefore appears to be especially suitable for tentative characterization of adrenergic receptors.", 
    "33": "3-(2-Diethylaminoethyl)-4-methyl-7-(carbethoxy-methoxy)-2-oxo-1,2-chromene-hydrochloride (carbocromen, Intensa\u00efn) was studied on a model of a brief intermittent myocardial ischemia in dogs. At doses which did not affect blood pressure and heart rate, carbocromen markedly improved the ischemic reaction as measured by the ST segment of the epicardial ECG. Higher doses--increasing heart rate--did not, however, aggravate ischemic reaction, although as a rule increasing heart rate enhances ischemic reaction. When keeping the heart rate constant by means of a pace maker, carbocromen even at higher dosage caused a clear-cut improvement. In order to exclude any influence of the experimental and time conditions of the model on the results, identical tests were performed with a placebo. The results proved the carbocromen effects to be independent of the model chosen and its duration. The effects of propranolol, nitroglycerin and isoproterenol observed in our experiments are in agreement with the results frequently described in literature. Considering the changes in ST segment of the epicardial ECG a criterion of myocardial injury, our findings permit the statement that carbocromen clearly reduces the negative sequelae of brief intermittent disturbance of coronary blood flow.", 
    "34": "In the rat, EDTA and isoproterenol stimulated PTH secretion, whereas high calcium and propranolol inhibited it. The stimulatory effects of EDTA and isoproterenol were still evident and unaltered in the presence of blocks induced by propranolol and high calcium, respectively. The findings suggest that: (i) both calcium and beta-adrenergic stimuli affect PTH secretion; and (ii) the two influences affect the PTH secretion by separate initial pathways.", 
    "35": "In four patients with Prinzmetal's variant form of angina, the attack was induced by the combined administration of epinephrine (0.4 to 0.5 mg, given subcutaneously at 7:30 to 8:00 A.M.) and propranolol (40 mg. given orally at 5:00 A.M.). Selective coronary cinearteriography was done before, during, and after the attack with constant monitoring of the ECG and blood pressure. Severe spasm of the right coronary artery occurred at the proximal portion in association with ST-segment elevation in Lead III during the attack and disappeared with the subsidence of the attack in all of them. These results strongly suggest that severe spasm of a large coronary artery mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors is responsible for the attack of Prinzmetal's variant form of angina.", 
    "36": "Regional myocardial function following occlusions of the circumflex coronary artery was studied in unanesthetized dogs using minature ultrasonic crystal pairs implanted subendocardially within the left ventricle for measurement of control, marginal, and ischemic lengths. As early as five beats after coronary occlusion, reduced function was apparent in ischemic zones, and an increase in heart rate occurred (78 to 115 beats/min) at an average of 25 sec. In the control zones, shortening initially increased from a constant end-diastolic length, but later end-diastolic length also increased by 7.5%. Shortening in the marginal zones was reduced by 50% at 90 sec as holosystolic expansion developed in the ischemic zones. On reperfusion, systolic function returned to normal within a few minutes while protodiastolic abnormalities persisted for up to 45 min. With coronary occlusions longer than two minutes most dogs exhibited arousal and further tachycardia; this reaction was prevented by morphine. During two minute occlusions morphine also decreased the heart rate increase by 37%, and marginal segment shortening was improved by 40%. Prior administration of propranolol also decreased heart rate during coronary occlusion and produced similar improvement in marginal segment function; however, in contrast to morphine, there was depression of contraction in the control segments. Nitroglycerin given during coronary occlusion caused decreases in end-diastolic length of all segments and increased shortening in the marginal segment by 28%. Lidocaine administered during coronary occlusion produced a mild depression of myocardial function in all regions of the heart.", 
    "37": "The antihypertensive effects of clonidine hydrochloride and practolol were compared in 42 men, aged 45 years, who had not received any antihypertensive therapy before, except one patient. The diastolic blood pressures were at least 110 mmHg on two successive visits to the health centre before their selection to the trial. One half of them were classified into the WHO group 1 and the other half into group 2. There was no statistical difference in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures between clonidine and practolol group at the end of placebo period. The study started with a three-week placebo period. Thereafter, 20 patients were given clonidine 0.225 mg and twenty-two practolol 200 mg daily. The next control was carried out after three weeks. The dosage was kept unchanged or increased according to the antihypertensive response. After three weeks, clonidine and practolol dosages were checked again, and 25 mg of chlorothiazide were added to the treatment in 15 clonidine cases and in 18 practolol cases. After the next three-week period, the same regimen was continued on most patients for 6-9 weeks. The daily dosage of clonidine varied from 0.225 to 0.900 (mean 0.394) mg and that of practolol from 200 to 600 (mean 382) mg. Both regimens resulted, when individually adjusted, in a mean systolic blood pressure level of less than 150 mmHg and diastolic pressures less than or equal to 100 mmHg. Hydrochlorothiazide potentiated the blood pressure effect almost equally in both regimens. The blood pressure reduction was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) both in the clonidine and practolol group. There was no significant difference of the mean blood pressures after the active drug therapy between these two groups. A moderate reduction of pulse rate was observed in both main groups, but it was not related to the antihypertensive efficacy. Side-effects were mild. Dryness of the mouth and sedation were more common in patients receiving clonidine. No oculocutaneous or other \"immunological\" manifestation were seen during the 15-18 weeks' practolol therapy.", 
    "38": "It was concluded that acebutolol alone, in the doses given over the periods for which it was used, produced a modest hypotensive effect, which was not quite so great as that produced by bendrofluazide alone, although the differences are not statistically significant. On the other hand, the combination of the two drugs produced both a more rapid and more effective hypotensive action, which was more than might be expected by simple summation of the effects of the two drugs together. It would be seen that, in view of the virtual absence of side-effects, the combination of acebutolol with bendrofluazide may be particularly effective in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "39": "Imidazole (0.73-15.9mM) was found to increase both tension developed Td and the maximum rats of rise of tension, dT/dtmax, in the isolated hemidiaphragm of the rat during indirect stimulation. Similar effects were obtained during direct stimulation and in the presence of d-tubocurarine. Imidazole (0.73-22 mM) antagonized the action of d-tubocurarine. This effect was particularly pronounced in preparations pretreated with imidazole. Propranolol did not significantly change the action of imidazole on Td and dT/dtmax during direct stimulation. Similarly, propranolol did not affect the action of low concentrations of imidazole during indirect stimulation. When present in the bath for periods of time longer than 15 min, propranolol significantly depressed the effect of even high concentrations of imidazole on Td and dT/dtmax during indirect stimulation. Histamine (0.18-0.91 mM) did not affect either Td or dT/dtmax. In the experiments in vivo, imidazole (12.5-100 mg/kg) produced a small increase both in Td and dT/dtmax of the gastrocnemius muscle during sciatic nerve stimulation. The available evidence indicates that the action of imidazole on Td and dT/dtmax is not connected with its action on phosphodiesterase, but it is most probably due to a direct action on the muscle.", 
    "40": "(1) Using isolated, blood-perfused atrium preparation of dogs, the effect of ischemia on sinus rate was studied in ten preparations. Cessation of atrial perfusion usually induced gradual deceleration of the sinus rate which was not blocked by atropine. Occasionally, brief and slight sinus acceleration was initially observed in three of ten atrium preparations. This positive chronotropic effect was not blocked by a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, propranolol. (2) In every preparation, just after release of occlusion, there was an initial profound sinus deceleration, occasionally followed by oscillatory changes in sinus rate. (3) The chronotropic response pattern induced by temporary occlusion and release of the sinus node artery was not influenced by propranolol, phenoxybenzamine or atropine treatment. (4) These results suggest that ischemia exerts its principal effect directly on the sino auricular node pacemaker cells, rather than on neighboring nerve endings.", 
    "41": "A case study in which propranolol hydrochloride was used as adjunct therapy in the treatment of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, thyrotoxicosis and high output heart failure is presented to illustrate the pharmacokinetics of this drug. The relationship of propranolol dosage to blood levels, the effect of blood levels on pharmacological response, the metabolism and elimination of propranolol, and determination of rational dosage of the drug, are discussed.", 
    "42": "The beta-adrenergic blocking agent, timolol, administered to resting rabbits as an i.v. bolus (0.125 mg/kg) sustained by a 2-hr infusion at 0.0625 mg/kg/hr, caused significant depression of plasma renin activity (PRA) to 49% of the control level. Significant correlations emerged between the fall in mean blood pressure and changes in both heart rate and PRA. Timolol also antagonized isoprenaline-induced renin release. In anaesthetized normal rats, timolol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed mean plasma renin concentration (PRC) to 16% of the pre-treatment value. Furthermore, the mean PRC of normal rats, bled immediately after decapitation, to avoid stimulating renin secretion, was reduced by 55% one hr after i.p. injection of timolol. The potency of timolol in this respect was 8 times that of dl-propranolol. Thus, in rabbits and rats, timolol effectively depresses both basal and stimulated plasma renin levels.", 
    "43": "Curves of experimentally plotted log (dose ratio-1) vs.-log [B] for the antagonism between adrenergic beta-mimetics, isoproterenol (ISO) and trimetoquinol (TMQ), and various beta-antagonists in relaxation of guinea-pig trachea could not be reasonably fitted to Schild's equation which has been commonly used in the analysis of drug-antagonism. Taking into consideration the saturable uptake process of the drug used herein, the equation presented in this paper fitted fairly well to the experimental curves and explains the following results: 1, TMQ was more strongly antagonized than ISO by all the blocking agents tested, that is, the apparent modes of antagonism were different between ISO and TMQ although they are considered to interact with the same receptor site. 2, The slope of the curve for a given antagonist markedly differed between ISO and TMQ. It is hypothesized that ISO is more easily taken up than TMQ. This was experimentally confirmed: i.e., ISO was potentiated about 8 fold by inhibiting the uptake process with dibenamine while TMQ was not. By pretreatment with dibenamine, the log (dose ratio-1) vs.-log [B] curve for the ISO-propranolol antagonism was shifted upward and superimposed with the theoretical curve of antagonism in which uptake of the agonist was neglected.", 
    "44": "In cell-free preparations (washed 600 x g pellets) of human renal medulla, glucagon produced a dose-dependent stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The stimulation of renal medullary adenylate cyclase by saturating concentrations of glucagon was additive to the saturating doses of vasopressin. Furthermore, L-isoproterenol stimulated renal medullary adenylate cyclase in a dose-dependent manner, and this stimulation was blocked by DL-propranolol. Stimulation of the renal medullary adenylate cyclase by maximal doses of glucagon and L-isoproterenol was additive. DL-Propranolol did not inhibit stimulation of glucagon. Thus, the results indicate the existence of a specific adenylate cyclase that is responsive to glucagon--distinct from the isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase and the previously described vasopressin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in human renal medulla. We suggest that the renal tubular effect of glucagon may be mediated by glucagon-dependent cyclic-AMP production in renal tissue.", 
    "45": "The duration of the cardiac effects of single intravenous doses of the beta-antagonists, timolol and propranolol, was compared in 6 healthy male subjects. Timolol and propranolol were given in doses of 1 mg and 10 mg, respectively, and at specified times after their administration, beta-blockade was assessed by the reduction of maximal exercise-induced tachycardia and by the inhibition of the chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol. Inotropic effects were measured by changes in the pre-ejection period of left ventricular systole obtained from systolic time intervals. There was no statistically significant difference in the timolol and propranolol time-courses of beta-blockade. The change in exercise-tachycardia was maximal 5 min after beta-antagonist infusion but dissipated rapidly so that no statistically significant change was observed 9 hr later. The chronotropic and inotropic effects of isoproterenol were almost completely antagonized for 11/2 hr after beta-antagonist infusion, and significant beta-blockade could be demonstrated 9 hr later. There was no difference in the time-course of the negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of either beta-antagonist.", 
    "46": "The effect of a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, metoprolol, on symptoms and exercise tolerance was studied in 16 patients with angina pectoris. Metroprolol was compared with placebo at two dose levels (20 mg t.d.s. and 50 mg t.d.s.) in a double-blind trial in 14 patients. Compared with placebo, metroprolol caused a significant reduction of heart rate and systolic blood pressure during exercise, and consequently a reduction of the rate-pressure product. The reduction was greater with 50 mg t.d.s. than with 20 mg t.d.s. The exercise tolerance measured as total work increased significantly by 21 per cent during treatment with metroprolol 20 mg t.d.s., and by 17 per cent during treatment with 50 mg t.d.s. There was a reduction in the number of anginal attacks and in nitroglycerin consumption, and subjective improvement of angina pectoris at both dose levels of metroprolol. No signs of cardiac failure appeared during any of the four treatment periods. Heart volume showed no significant change. Unwanted effects were of the same frequency and severity during treatment with metroprolol at both dose levels as with placebo.", 
    "47": "The ability of either beta-adrenergic blockade or bilateral renal denervation to alter erythropoietin (ESF) production in rabbits exposed to hypobaric hypoxia was studied. ESF elaboration during 5 h of exposure to hypoxia was not affected by beta-blockade, but was markedly reduced by prior surgical denervation of both kidneys. After 18 h of hypoxia plasma ESF levels in renal denervated rabbits did not differ significantly from those of sham-operated controls. Previous studies have shown that ESF production during this more prolonged exposure to hypoxia was significantly inhibited by some beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Combined renal denervation and beta-blockade were more effective than renal denervation alone in attenuating ESF production during 5 h of exposure to hypoxia. However, ESF elaboration during 18 h of hypoxia was significantly greater in animals with combined denervation and beta-blockade than in control rabbits. These results suggest the existence of two distinct mechanisms for ESF production in rabbits exposed to hypobaric hypoxia.", 
    "48": "A neurogenic beta-adrenergic vasodilatation in skeletal muscle has been indicated by some recent investigations. The present study describes the extent to which this neurogenic beta-dilator mechanism contributes to the integrated vascular response in consecutive sections of the muscle vascular bed during sympathetic nerve activation. This was done by studying the vascular reactions to graded sympathetic stimulation (1-16 Hz) before and after beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Beta-blockade did not influence significantly the sympathetically induced changes of total muscle vascular resistance or capacitance. Vascular tone in the \"micro-vessels\" during stimulation was, however, clearly more pronounced in the beta-blocked than in the non-blocked region, as revealed by segmental resistance analysis and by determination of precapillary sphincter tone (CFC). In addition, beta-blockade markedly reduced the net transcapillary absorption of extravascular fluid evoked by nerve activation. This effect could be ascribed to the mentioned influence on the precapillary sphincters, leading to a decrease of the number of capillaries available for transcapillary exchange, and to a limitation of the nerve induced fall of capillary hydrostatic pressure. The described effects of alpha-blockade were observed at all rates of sympathetic stimulation.--The conclusion was reached that the beta-adrenergic dilator component of the sympathetic vascular response in skeletal muscle significantly modifies the alpha-adrenergic constriction in the micro-vessels. It is suggested that, in the intact organism, this neurogenic beta-dilator mechanism is primarily aimed at improving the transcapillary exchange.", 
    "49": "Prior studies indicated that chronic ethanol feeding induced noradrenergic subsensitivity of the cerebral cortex. Sensitivity was measured using the cAMP response of brain slices to norepinephrine (NE). In the present report we investigated the possibility that noradrenergic receptors in a visceral organ might be similarly affected by ethanol feeding. The cAMP response of liver homogenates to NE was measured. Chronic ethanol ingestion induced subsensitivity of the liver to NE similar to that observed in the brain. The ED50 was shifted to the right from 2.1 X 10(-5) M to 1.3 X 10(-4) M NE. By 3 days of ethanol withdrawal the cAMP response returned to control levels.", 
    "50": "The quarternary ammonium compound, UM-424 [1-dimethyl isopropylamino-3-(2-phenylphenoxy)-propan-2-ol chloride], was evaluated for its antiarrhythmic and hemodynamic effects. UM-424 converted ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in the anesthetized dog when administered in an average dose of 4.6 mg/kg i.v. Pretreatment of anesthetized dogs with UM-424, 10 mg/kg, provided complete protection against the development of premature beats and ventricular fibrillation when the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 20 minutes and then released. UM-424 was effective in reversing ventricular arrhythmias in conscious animals which had been subjected to a two-stage ligation of the anterior descending coronary artery. The mean ectopic rate in a group of five dogs was 143 +/- 4.0 (S.E.M.) beats/min 24 hours after coronary ligation. Normal sinus rhythm was restored with a mean dose of 9.5 mg/kg of UM-424 and was maintained for a period in excess of 60 minutes. The ventricular fibrillation threshold was increased from a control value of 4.0 +/- 0.4 to 26.2 +/- 8.6 mA (P less than .05) 30 minutes after pretreatment with UM-424, 10 mg/kg. Inotropic and chronotropic dose-response studies to isoproterenol in the anesthetized dog demonstrated that the quarternary compound lacked beta adrenergic receptor blocking properties. UM-424, 10 mg/kg, did not produce any persistent changes in spontaneous heart rate, cardiac contractile force, left ventricular dP/ct, mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.", 
    "51": "The ability of d,l-propranolol to block renin secretion in response to various extrarenal stimuli, such as hemorrhage and hypoglycemia, has been interpreted to indicate the presence of an intrarenal beta receptor regulating renin release. However, two problems complicate this interpretation: (a) the stimuli have effects outside the kidney, and (b) d,l-propranolol has a local anesthetic, as well as a beta adrenergic blocking, action. In the present study, the effects of a purely intrarenal stimulus, in the form of renal nerve stimulation (RNS), on renin secretion was examined. The effects of d,l-propranolol (anesthetic and beta-blocking activity), l-propranolol (beta-blocking activity only), and d-propranolol (local anesthetic activity only) on the renin response to RNS were examined. In a control group of animals, two sequential RNS increased mean renin secretion from 401 to 1,255 U/min (P less than 0.25) and from 220 to 2,179 U/min (P less than 0.01). In a second group the first RNS increased renin secretion from 201 to 1,181 U/min (P less than 0.01), but after d,l-propranolol was given RNS did not significantly alter renin secretion (33 to 55 U/min). In a third group the initial RNS increased renin secretion from 378 to 1,802 U/min (P less than 0.025), but after l-propranolol was given RNS had no significant effect on renin secretion (84 to 51 U/min). A fourth group of dogs showed a rise in renin secretion from 205 to 880 U/min (P less than 0.001) in response to the first RNS, while the second RNS, given after an infusion of d-propranolol, caused a rise in renin secretion from 80 to 482 (P less than 0.005). The nature of the electrical stimulus was consistent in all groups and caused no detectable changes in renal or systemic hemodynamics or in urinary electrolyte excretion. The results, therefore, indicate that renin secretion can be stimulated through intrarenal beta receptors independent of changes in systemic or renal hemodynamics or in tubular sodium reabsorption. Hence the effect of beta stimulation on renin secretion would appear to result from a direct action on the renin-secreting cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus.", 
    "52": "We examined the possibility that dopamine may play a role in nerve-mediated \"off\" responses of esophageal body (EB) and relaxations of lower esophageal spincter (LES) smooth muscle. The effects of dopamine, epinine, and dopamine antagonists on EB and LES smooth muscle were studied on these responses. Dopamine and epinine caused a dose-related fall in basal LES muscle tension and in amplitude of EB muscle \"off\" responses. Threshold dose for both was about 10(-7) M, and maximal dose was about 10(-4) M. At high concentrations, they also caused repetitive transient contractions of both LES and EB muscle after the period of inhibition. These effects were antagonized by haloperidol, 10(-5) M, and bulbocapnine, 10(-5) M, but were not influenced by propranolol, 10(-5) M, nor by phenoxybenzamine, 10(-5) M. Neither haloperidol nor bulbocapnine influenced responses to electrical field stimulation. Tetrodotoxin 10(-7) M abolished the responses to electrical field stimulation but did not antagonize the effects of dopamine and epinine. EB and LES smooth muscle contain a dopamine receptor. It is unlikely that dopamine is involved in responses to electrical field stimulation.", 
    "53": "In conscious trained dogs, administration of bromazepam (0.3 mg/kg p.o.) or diazepam (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg p.o.) had no influence on heart rate. A higher dose (10 mg/kg p.o.) of two benzodiazepines elicited a positive chronotropic effect which was rapid in onset and of long duration. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent practolol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) did not revert heart rate after the benzodiazepines to the same level as in controls, indicating that the tachycardia was not produced by an increase in sympathetic outflow to the heart. For diazepam, a sympathetic--parasympathetic interaction cannot be excluded. However, diazepam and bromazepam significantly reduced the tachycardia which is normally observed after administration of methylatropine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) alone or in combination with practolol. In anaesthetized dogs, bromazepam failed to modify the heart rate responses to electrical stimulation of cardiac vagal or sympathetic nerves, excluding an action on this compound on ganglionic transmission and cardiac cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors. It is concluded that high doses of diazepam and bromazepam influence the heart rate of conscious dogs in a biphasic way. Firstly, they cause a central reduction of vagal tone to the heart resulting in tachycardia. Secondly, the two drugs decrease the cardiac pacemaker rate directly. Since the overall effect is tachycardia, the central action is more pronounced.", 
    "54": "The rectal temperature of male rats was measured in a thermoneutral environment (25 degrees C) and at ambient temperatures of 15 and 35 degrees C. Unless otherwise specified all drugs were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) and all results are reported for the thermoneutral environment. Exposure to 15 degrees C did not affect the rectal temperature but exposure to 35 degrees C produced hyperthermia. At 15 and 25 degrees C, 20 mug GABA produced hyperthermia which was longer lasting at the former ambient temperature. GABA (20 mug) prevented the hyperthermic effect of exposure to 35 degrees C and produced hypothermia in animals maintained at this temperature for 1 hr. A low dose (1 mug) of NA produced hyperthermia and a higher dose (mug) hypothermia. In rats pretreated with sodium salicylate (i.p.), 20 mug GABA and 1 mug NA produced hypothermia instead of hyperthermia, suggesting the release of PGE in mediating hyperthermia. The hypothermic effect of 10 mug NA and of GABA observed at 35 degrees C was blocked by phentolamine, an indication of the possibility of alpha-adrenoceptor mediation.", 
    "55": "The haemodynamic effects of timolol and its inhibiting action on the cardiovascular and bronchial effects of isoproterenol have been studied. Splanchnic nerve activity was recorded. The antiarrhythmic action of timolol was studied on guinea pig isolated atria, using arrhythmias induced by epinephrine, ouabain or coronary ligation in the dog. Timolol is a very potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, without specificity on beta1- or beta2-receptors. No intrinsic beta-stimulating or depressant effects were found. Timolol reduced splanchnic discharges. The antiarrhythmic effect of timolol was limited to epinephrine-induced arrhythmias.", 
    "56": "Receptor blocking drugs were used to determine whether adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic synapses are involved in mediating the LH release induced by intraventricularly injected PGE2. Prostaglandin E2 (5mug) was injected into the 3rd ventricle (3rd V) of ovariectomized rats, and plasma LH concentrations before and after treatment were determined by radioimmunoassay. Phentolamine, 20 or 30 mug, or pronethalol, 20 mug (alpha and beta adrenergic receptor blockers, respectively) injected into the 3rd V failed to alter the elevation of plasma LH evoked by PGE2 injected into the ventricle 10 min later. Likewise, LH release following PGE2 was not changed when a dopaminergic blocker, pimozide (0.63 mg/kg, SC), was injected 2 h prior to PGE2. Two antagonists of serotonin, methysergide maleate (3 mg/kg ip) or cinanserin HC1 (1 mg/kg iv) given 2 h or 45 min before PGE2, respectively, failed to alter the action of PGE2. Atropine (100 or 250 mug) injected into the 3rd V 10 min prior to PGE2 was also ineffective in blocking the increase in plasma LH following PGE2. The results of this study indicate that the effect of PGE2 on LH release is not mediated by adrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic, or cholinergic receptors. They also suggest that PGE2 is not acting trans-synaptically but probably directly on the LHRH neuron to induce the discharge of LHRH into the hypophysial portal vessels which then evokes release of LH from the adenohypophysis.", 
    "57": "Experiments were conducted in anesthetized dogs comparing the effects of PGA1, PGE2, and diazoxide on myocardial contractile force (MC). The three agents were given in successive bolus injections intravenously in equidepressor doses and myocardial contractile force was measured by means of a strain-gauge arch sutured onto the right ventricle. The drugs were administered before and during ganglionic (hexamethonium) and beta-blockade (practolol). Both PGA1, and PGE2 caused a marked rise in MC, 24 and 20 per cent, respectively, before blockade and 10 and 11 per cent during blockade. Diazoxide caused only a minimal rise, 0.9 per cent, before blockade and a marked fall, 27 per cent, during blockade. Diazoxide administration during left ventricular bypass indicates that the decrease in MC is not a direct result of alterations in preload or after load. It is suggested that hypertensive patients treated with autonomic blocking agents may be more susceptible to heart failure in response to diazoxide therapy.", 
    "58": "Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists have been utilized in an atempt to discern the site of action of prostaglandin (PG) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the eye. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists (alpha-antagonists, phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine; beta-antagonists, propranolol and sotalol) cuased a dose-dependent reduction in intraocular pressure and blood pressure and increased total outflow facility. The results are consistent with the concept that both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors are present in the anterior uvea and that vasomotor tone is essential to the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure. No antagonist reduced the PG-induced elevation of intraocular pressure unless the blood pressure was severely lowered. All antagonists inhibit the normal PG-induced increase in total outflow facility, indicating that these agents protect the blood-aqueous barrier from breakdown without altering the vasodilatory response to PG. All antagonists reduced the fall in intraocular pressure produced by THC by approximately 50 per cent, except for sotalol which completely abolished the intraocular pressure fall. Only the alpha-adrenergic antagonists prevented the THC-induced increase in total outflow facility. The results indicate that true outflow facility may well be regulated exclusively by alpha-receptors. The data are consistent with the effect of THC being primarily a vasodilation of the efferent blood vessels of the anterior uvea. The partial inhibition by alpha-adrenergic antagonists may also suggest a lesser role of THC on the afferent vessels.", 
    "59": "Previous studies on renin release by an in vitro system of rat kidney slices, which is devoid of hemodynamic influences, have provided evidence that renin release is stimulated by a beta-adrenergic mechanism. We used this system to study effects of tyramine (an indirectly acting amine capable of displacing endogenous catecholmines from sympathetic nerve endings) on renin release. Tyramine (10(-3)M) in the presence of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (pheniprazine, 10(-5)M) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (theophylline, 10(-3)M) significantly (P less than 0.01) stimulated renin release when values were compared to control observations for media containing only the inhibitors. Tyramine-induced stimulation of renin release was blocked by the beta-blocking agent, propranolol (2 X 10(-4) M), and the neural uptake blocking agent, cocaine (10(-5) M), but not by the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine (9 X 10(-4) M). These observations demonstrate a potential role for the sympathetic innervation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus on renin release.", 
    "60": "In a crossover study 32 patients with hypertension were randomly allocated to treatment with spironolactone 200 mg/day for two months, propranolol 320 mg/day for two months, and a combination of both drugs at half the dose. Between the treatments placebo was given for two months. Both spironolactone and propranolol lowered the blood pressure significantly in both positions. The initial plasma renin activity (PRA) levels ranged from 0-4 to 5-0 mug angiotensin I l-1 h-1, and there was a close correlation between these levels and the effects of the drugs: with increasing PRA the response to propranolol was better while the opposite was true for spironolactone. Spironolactone reduced the blood pressure more at eight than at four weeks, while no such difference could be shown for propranolol. Spironolactone and propranolol together decreased the blood pressure still further irrespective of the initial PRA. All patients achieved a normal supine blood pressure.", 
    "61": "The clinical course and coronary arteriographic findings in 5 patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina pectoris are reviewed. In 4 patients who had ST-elevations inferiorly, 1 had minimal, 1 only slight, and 1 medium coronary artery disease; 1 had coronary spasm. 1 patient with ST-elevation anteriorly had severe stenosis of the anterior descending coronary artery. All 5 patients had normal left ventriculograms, 3 also had normal left enddiastolic pressure, and 2 slight elevation. Medical treatment was carried out in 2 patients and surgical revascularization in 2. Both treatments were accompanied by marked symptomatic improvement. Spontaneous loss of angina occurred in 1 patient. Prinzmetal's variant angina pectoris may be accompanied by a variety of coronary arteriographic findings and the prognosis appears to be more favorable than previously reported.", 
    "62": "In the present investigation experiments were carried out to determine whether the functionally obscure synaptic rebbons of mammalian pinealocytes can be affected by acute changes in environmental lighting and which chemical processes may be involved in their regulation. Experiments carried out in male guinea-pigs have shown that the amounts of synaptic ribbons are immediately affected by changes in the lighting pattern. Extension of the light period reduced the normally occurring increase, whereas extension of the dark period inhibited the normally occurring decrease in the amount of synaptic ribbons. Results following injections of a number of drugs known to influence pineal function (noradrenaline, L-DOPA, propranolol, reserpine and p-chlorophenylalanine, respectively) suggest that synaptic ribbons may be directly or indirectly regulated by beta-adrenergic mechanisms."
