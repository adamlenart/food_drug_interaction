    "0": "1. Pilocarpine and other cholinomimetic drugs convert isoprenaline to a vasoconstrictor and pressor agent.2. This effect of pilocarpine was abolished by atropine; it is thus an acetylcholine-like response. It was not dependent on the integrity of the central nervous system or the adrenal glands and was not abolished by ganglionic blockade.3. The constrictor action of isoprenaline after pilocarpine was abolished by propranolol; this action of isoprenaline is thus on the beta-adrenoceptor. Another beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agent, salbutamol, resembled isoprenaline in this situation, though papaverine and acetylcholine did not.4. The constrictor action of isoprenaline after pilocarpine was abolished by phenoxybenzamine, guanethidine and cocaine; the effect did not appear after reserpine pretreatment.5. These results suggest an action of cholinomimetic drugs at adrenergic nerve endings which permits the uptake of beta-adrenoceptor stimulating agents resulting in the release of neuronal transmitter.", 
    "1": "Freshly prepared duck erythrocytes, incubated either in plasma or an isotonic synthetic medium containing norepinephrine ([K] of both media approximately 2.5 mM), maintain water and electrolyte composition in the steady state (upper steady state) for at least 90 min. If incubated in the synthetic medium without norepinephrine or in plasma to which a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (propranolol) is added, the cells lose both water and electrolyte (predominantly KCl) until a new steady state is reached (lower steady state). Reaccumulation of water and electrolyte from isotonic solutions toward the upper steady-state levels requires the addition of norepinephrine and KCl. Reaccumulation is maximal when the concentration of K and norepinephrine in the medium is 15 mM and 10(-7)M, respectively. Dibutyryl cyclic-AMP (10(-2)M) mimics norepinephrine in lower steady-state cells. Although an analogous effect in upper steady-state cells was not established with certainty, it is proposed that the catecholamine-induced net changes in water and electrolyte movement in duck erythrocytes are a consequence of stimulation of the activity of a membrane-bound adenyl cyclase system.", 
    "2": "Dogs were given infusions of norepinephrine and subsequent additional infusions of propranolol and nicotinic acid over a 4-hr period. Under different physiological conditions, alpha-lipoproteins of three different electrophoretic mobilities were identified by means of paper electrophoresis; they were designated alpha-lipoproteins X, Y, and Z. During norepinephrine infusion, alpha-lipoprotein Y fell from 45% (of all lipoproteins) to 14%. There was a reciprocal rise in alpha-lipoprotein Z. On the other hand, alpha-lipoprotein X was not significantly changed. There was evidence that alpha-lipoprotein Y was progressively transformed into alpha-lipoprotein Z by increasing plasma FFA concentrations. The percentages of both alpha-lipoproteins Y and Z returned to original values after the dogs were given either nicotinic acid or propranolol. The alterations in the alpha-lipoprotein peaks Y and Z were rapid, being noted within 5 min of change in plasma FFA concentration. However, there appeared to be a threshold of plasma FFA concentration of 1200 micro Eq/liter, below which no changes in alpha-lipoproteins were noted. It was concluded that alpha-lipoprotein Y is rapidly, progressively, but reversibly transformed into alpha-lipoprotein Z by binding to plasma FFA above a threshold level of 1200 micro Eq/liter. However, alpha-lipoprotein X does not appear to be involved in the binding of plasma FFA.", 
    "3": "In order to determine whether an adrenergic mechanism is involved in the secretion of growth hormone and insulin, the effect of adrenergic-blocking or -stimulating agents on plasma human growth hormone (HGH), immunoreactive insulin, blood free fatty acids (FFA), and glucose levels was studied in normal human subjects. The intravenous infusion of propranolol, a beta adrenergic-blocking agent, caused a rise in plasma HGH, a transient decrease in blood FFA, and no significant change in plasma insulin. This increase in plasma HGH was inhibited either by the combined administration of isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic-stimulating agent, along with propranolol or by oral glucose loading immediately before the start of propranolol infusion. The concomitant administration of epinephrine and propranolol brought about a rise in plasma HGH comparable with that produced by propranolol alone, without any significant change in blood FFA. Alpha adrenergic blockade by the intravenous infusion of phenotolamine significantly suppressed plasma HGH responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and to arginine infusion, and enhanced plasma insulin response to arginine infusion. It also stimulated lipid mobilization significantly. The intravenous infusion of alpha adrenergic-stimulating agents, phenylephrine and methoxamine, caused an increase in plasma HGH, a slight decrease in blood FFA, and no significant change in plasma insulin. This increase in plasma HGH was significantly inhibited by the simultaneous administration of phentolamine along with methoxamine. On the contrary, a beta adrenergic stimulant, isoproterenol, raised plasma insulin and blood FFA, and abolished the plasma HGH response to propranolol. Another beta stimulator, isoxsuprine, raised blood FFA but not plasma insulin. It is concluded that either beta adrenergic blockade or alpha stimulation enhances HGH secretion and inhibits insulin secretion and fat mobilization, whereas either alpha blockade or beta stimulation stimulates insulin secretion and fat mobilization and inhibits HGH secretion.", 
    "4": "Histamine has positive inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart which are not abolished by beta adrenergic-blocking agents. Since the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of other hormones on the heart are thought to be mediated by cyclic 3',5'-AMP, we examined the effect of histamine on adenyl cyclase in particulate preparations of guinea pig, cat, and human myocardium. Histamine at the peak of its dose-response curve, 3 x 10(-4)moles/liter, produced approximately a 300% increase in cyclic 3',5'-AMP accumulation in the guinea pig, 60% in the cat, and 90% in the human heart particles. Half-maximal activity for the histamine mediated activation of adenyl cyclase in the guinea pig was 9 x 10(-6)moles/liter, almost identical with that observed for norepinephrine in the same preparation. DL-Propranolol, 1 x 10(-5)moles/liter, did not abolish the activation of adenyl cyclase produced by histamine but did abolish the activation produced by norepinephrine. In contrast, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, Benadryl, 8 x 10(-5)moles/liter, abolished the activation of adenyl cyclase by histamine but not that produced by norepinephrine. These data suggest that there are at least two receptor sites in guinea pig heart mediating the activation of adenyl cyclase, one responsive to histamine, the other to norepinephrine. In addition, combined maximal doses of histamine and norepinephrine produced completely additive effects on the activation of adenyl cyclase, which suggests that at least two separate adenyl cyclase systems are present in the heart, each responsive to one of these hormones. However, definitive proof would require physical separation of the two enzymes.", 
    "5": "1. The effects of intravenous injection of lignocaine and propranolol were studied in dogs.2. Ventricular ectopic beats produced by intravenous injection of adrenaline in anaesthetized dogs respired with halothane were abolished in four out of six dogs by lignocaine. Propranolol was effective in all three dogs tested.3. Intravenous infusion of lignocaine at (0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg)/min to total doses of 3.0 +/- 1.0 and 2.2 +/- 0.5 mg/kg, respectively, abolished the ventricular tachycardia produced in anaesthetized dogs by ouabain. A similar effect was produced by infusion of propranolol at (0.2 mg/kg)/min to a total dose of 1.9 +/- 0.4 mg/kg. Intravenous injection of single doses of lignocaine (4.0-8.0 mg/kg) also abolished the arrhythmia.4. The frequency of the ventricular ectopic beats occurring in conscious dogs 20-44 h after ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery was reduced, with an increase in the number of sinus beats, after intravenous injection of lignocaine (8.0 mg/kg). Larger doses produced excitement. Propranolol (4.0 mg/kg) had a greater effect than the same dose of lignocaine but after 8.0 mg/kg, three of the four dogs died.5. Propranolol was more effective than lignocaine in abolishing the three different types of arrhythmia.6. Dose-response curves showed that lignocaine was more active in abolishing the ouabain induced arrhythmia than the halothane-adrenaline arrhythmia and was least active on the arrhythmia caused by ligation of the coronary artery.", 
    "6": "Injection of norepinephrine in the lateral ventricles of rats recovering from lateral hypothalamic anorexia caused immediate feeding and, frequently, overeating. Intraventricular administration of the alpha-noradrenergic blocker, phentolamine, suppressed feeding in both normal rats and rats that had recovered from lateral hypothalamic lesions. Feeding is reinforced by ascending medial forebrain bundle fibers that form alpha-noradrenergic synapses in the hypothalamus and forebrain. Damage to these fibers suppresses feeding by reducing noradrenergic transmission and, hence, the rewarding value of food. Recovery of feeding after hypothalamic lesions coincides with the recovery of noradrenergic reward function."
