    "0": "The effect of exercise on plasma atenolol was evaluated using a two-phase complete crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. In one phase, the volunteers were subjected to physical exertion on a treadmill; in the other phase, they remained in a sitting or standing position. Following a single 100-mg atenolol dose, frequent blood samples and a complete urine collection were obtained over 24 hr. Plasma and urine atenolol levels were assayed by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Plasma atenolol was significantly (p less than 0.05) higher during the exercise phase of the study, and this result was associated with approximately an 8% decrease in the renal clearance of the drug, probably due to decreased renal blood flow during exercise.", 
    "1": "1. The acute effects of hydrochlorothiazide, amiloride, timolol and their combinations on diuresis and arterial pressure were studied in rats. 2. Timolol did not modify the diuretic and saluretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide and/or amiloride and had no diuretic or antidiuretic effects alone. 3. At a single dose of 1.25 mg/kg, p.o., timolol alone had no antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 4. The antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride + timolol was significantly greater than with any of the drugs alone.", 
    "2": "1. The sensitivity of human metacarpal veins and digital arteries obtained post-mortem to noradrenaline and phenylephrine has been tested. 2. pED50 values for noradrenaline were significantly higher in the veins (6.99, s.e.m. = 0.08) than in the arteries (6.56, s.e.m. = 0.09), whereas pED50 values for phenylephrine in the two tissues were not significantly different (arteries: 6.24, s.e.m. = 0.09; veins: 6.26, s.e.m. = 0.05). 3. The addition of propranolol (4 x 10(-6) mol/l) alone, or in combination with hydrocortisone (4 x 10(-5) mol/l), did not affect the responses to either noradrenaline or phenylephrine. The further addition of cocaine (3 x 10(-5) mol/l) slightly shifted the noradrenaline and phenylephrine concentration-effect curves to the left in both arteries and veins, but veins were still found to be more sensitive than arteries to noradrenaline whilst there was still no difference in the sensitivity of veins and arteries to phenylephrine. 4. Cocaine also slightly potentiated responses to barium chloride, potassium chloride and serotonin. 5. It is concluded that the difference in sensitivity to noradrenaline between arteries and veins cannot be explained by differences in neuronal uptake and it is possible that there may be differences in the properties of the postsynaptic alpha-adrenoreceptors of the two tissues. It is also concluded that the potentiation of the contractile effect of noradrenaline produced by cocaine is not solely due to inhibition of neuronal uptake of amines.", 
    "3": "Diclofurine is a new ketone-oxime derivative with potent peripheral vasodilating properties. Its hypotensive effects were studied in 24 patients suffering from severe hypertension resistant to combinations of most hypotensive drugs. In 22 patients who received diclofurime alone the blood pressure decreased from mean values of 194 +/- 1/118 +/- 3 to 166 +/- 4/97 +/- 3 mmHg after the weeks of treatment and remined at simular levels on further examinations. Most remarkably, the fall in BP was accompanied by a decrease of 15 beats/minute in supine heart rate. The mean daily dosage of diclofurime was 518 mg, the drug being taken in three divided doses. In 7 cases where diclofurime was combined with acebutolol either from the start or (in 5 cases) after an initial period of monotherapy, the efficacy of the treatment was enhanced by the beta-blocking agent. Out of 24 patients studied only one failed to respond. The new drug was generally well tolerated. Diclofurime appears to be one of the most active and best tolerated drugs for long-term oral treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "4": "Rat submandibular gland was dissociated by enzymatic digestion with collagenase and hyaluronidase, followed by mild mechanical shearing and filtration through a nylon mesh. The dissociated cell populations contained predominantly groups of acinar cells which maintained their acinar arrangement. The morphological and functional viability of the cells was confirmed by electron microscopic examination and a normal secretory response to beta-adrenergic or cholinergic stimulation was observed. Both isoproterenol (IPR) and carbachol caused the fusion of secretory granules into large vacuoles which were also continuous with the lumen, and into which the secretory product was released. Secretion was assessed quantitatively from the incorporation of 14C-glucosamine into the acinar cells and its subsequent release into the culture medium as labelled glycoprotein. IPR stimulated secretion to 125% of untreated controls in the concentration range t x 10(-5) to 5x 10(-7) M and to 110% of controls at 5 x 10(-8) M, after 40 min incubation. Carbachol stimulated secretion to 131% of controls at 5 x 10(-5) M and to 115% at 5 x 10(-6) M but had no effect at 5 x 10(-7) or 5 x 10(-8) M. The secretory response was blocked by the respective beta-adrenergic and cholinergic antagonists, propranolol and atropine. These findings show that dissociated rat submandibular acinar cells provide a useful in vitro model for the study of mucus synthesis and secretion.", 
    "5": "The haemodynamic responses to isovolumic anaemia (dextran-for-blood exchange) were studied in seven dogs pretreated with propranolol 20 mg/kg body weight for 3 weeks. Adrenergic beta-receptor blockade did not prevent significant increases in heart rate (up to 19%). Cardiac output increased by about 20% while systemic vascular resistance decreased by the same proportion. Oxygen extraction increased from 24% to 35% and this was reflected by a decrease in mixed venous PO2 by 1.2 kPa. The modest hyperdynamic response of the circulation to haemodilution in the presence of high-grade adrenergic beta-receptor blockade is in sharp contrast with the large hyperdynamic response that has been reported in its absence and indicates that normal compensatory mechanisms are considerably impaired.", 
    "6": "In adult dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, ventricular fibrillation thresholds determined by scanning the vulnerable period with a train of 14 pulses (4 ms, 100 Hz) were significantly less (P less than 0.01) than fibrillation thresholds determined by scanning the vulnerable period with a single 10-ms stimulus. Following beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol, the relative increase in the fibrillation thresholds measured with trains was about seven times greater than the relative increase in the single-stimulus threshold (P less than 0.01). In a group of animals subjected to chronic cardiac denervation, fibrillation thresholds measured with trains were about three times greater than in a group of shamthoracotomized animals (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, the train fibrillation thresholds of the catecholamine-depleted hearts were not significantly different from the train thresholds of beta-blocked innervated hearts. These data, coupled with the finding that trains of stimuli produced a marked augmentation in local myocardial contractile force, suggest that locally released norepinephrine during a fibrillation-threshold determination may exert a profound influence on the level of current necessary to evoke fibrillation.", 
    "7": "After destruction, by pithing, of the central nervous system, the blood pressure (BP) of the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rat falls, but remains higher than in the pithed normotensive (WKY) rat. At all ages examined, stimulation of the sympathetic outflow evoked greater increases in BP of pithed SHR rats, but the increases in plasma catecholamines were similar in the two strains. The BP increase evoked by administered norepinephrine was greater in old SHR than in old WKY rats, but this increased response was not found in young animals. Both young and old SHR rats, however, were more sensitive than WKY rats to the pressor effects of epinephrine. Results of selective pharmacologic blockade of cardiac or vascular beta-adrenoceptors suggest that a smaller vasodilator response in young SHR rats to the beta-adrenergic effects of epinephrine is responsible for the greater pressor response than in WKY rats. This factor diminishes in older SHR rats in which, as suggested by Folkow, structural changes in the resistance blood vessel diameter may account for the enhanced pressor responsivity of SHR rats.", 
    "8": "Oxygen consumption (VO2) in an isolated, autoperfused, statically exercising canine gracilis muscle (2.5% P0) was studied in low blood flow (Q) states induced by constant norepinephrine (NE) infusion and by mechanical occlusion (MO). Q and VO2 were evaluated at rest (Qc and VO2c), after 5 min of exercise (Qe and VO2e) and after 5 more min of exercise with either NE or MO (Qt and VO2t). Data were normalized and plotted as the VO2e-VO2t)/(VO2c-VO2e) vs. (Qe-Qt)/(Qc-Qe) and equations of the lines for NE (y = 0.090x + 0.048) and for MO (y = 0.488x + 0.070) were determined. The slopes of the lines, tested by analysis of covariance, were significantly different (P less than 0.005). These data indicate that when NE reduced Q during exercise, the exercise induced in VO2 was protected to a greater degree than when MO reduced Q under similar conditions. To determine if the effect of NE on VO2 was secondary to a beta-adrenergic-receptor-mediated of skeletal muscle metabolic processes, the experiments were repeated in the presence of beta-blockade with propranolol. In the presence of beta-blockade, the effects of NE on skeletal muscle VO2 were unchanged. It is therefore hypothesized that the mechanism of this effect of NE may be an increase in the efficiency of oxygen extraction resulting from a redistribution of blood flow to more active muscle fiber regions.", 
    "9": "The kinetics of tritiated metoprolol and its metabolites have been determined after intravenous and oral administration in dialysis patients. The kinetic behaviour of metoprolol in these patients does not differ from that in healthy volunteers, since its elimination depends on hepatic metabolism. The pharmacologically less active metabolite alpha-hydroxymetoprolol is formed to an individually varying degree and its half-life is prolonged. The concentration of the total radioactivity, which represents the sum of all metabolites, does not decline in the dialysis interval. During haemodialysis, however, its concentration decreases with a half-life of 5h. It might be assumed, that dialysis of these polar compounds is rather nonspecific and that it depends essentially on the dialysis technique.", 
    "10": "Plasma concentration and urinary excretion of total and 2 active metabolites of metoprolol have been studied in patients with varying degrees of renal impairment and in healthy subjects after intravenous and oral administration of 20 and 50 mg of 3H-metoprolol tartrate respectively. Renal clearance of total metabolites correlated directly with 51Cr-EDTA clearance (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). A reduction of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 70 to 80% increased the elimination half-life of total metabolites and of the active metabolite alpha-hydroxymetoprolol about 3-fold. Significant accumulation was, however, only observed in the patients with a GFR of about 5 ml/min. Even in these patients, the contribution of alpha-hydroxymetoprolol to the beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of metoprolol will be negligible. The second active metabolite studied is eliminated via biotransformation, and the urinary excretion as well as the plasma concentration of this metabolite were extremely low in comparison with those of the parent drug.", 
    "11": "A new myocardial support system has been developed and a study of this system is reported. Cardioplegia was induced by continuous infusion of potent \"cardioplegic\" agents (potassium chloride and potassium chloride with propranolol) at the aortic root in 12 dogs subjected to cardiopulmonary bypass with total body hypothermia (20 degrees C). A low-flow normal-pressure perfusion was maintained with the aid of a norepinephrine drip. During the period of hypothermia the blood pH was maintained at 7.6 and serum magnesium concentration was increased to an average of 2.1 mmol/l by parenteral infusion of magnesium sulfate. At no time was ischemia induced and the aorta was not cross-clamped. The functional recovery to normal and preservation of the ultrastructure of the subendocardium after 4 hours of perfusion in cardioplegia were remarkable. The control hearts from hypothermic dogs that were allowed to fibrillate spontaneously showed severe damage.", 
    "12": "The distribution of radioactivity in 15 ocular and extraocular tissues or fluids of the rabbit after ocular instillation and intravenous injection of 100 microL of 14C-labeled timolol solution (1.5%) was studied by liquid scintillation counting (LSC). The drug was distributed rapidly among the tissues examined after both routes of administration. Levels of radioactivity were considerably greater in ocular tissues after instillation as compared with intravenous injection, whereas in extraocular tissues the levels were similar after both routes of administration. Using the same experimental protocol, aqueous humor and serum levels of unchanged timolol were measured by gas liquid chromatography. Comparisons with LSC studies indicated that, following ocular instillation, only unchanged timolol was present in aqueous humor, whereas both timolol and metabolites were present in serum. After intravenous administration, timolol was rapidly metabolized and metabolites appeared in the serum and aqueous humor.", 
    "13": "In a crossover design study, we assessed effects on intraocular pressure, pupillary diamter, pulse rate, and blood pressure over six hours of one drop of 0.5% timolol maleate and 2% epinephrine hydrochloride in one eye. Both eyes of each patient had been pretreated for one week with twice-daily applications pf epinephrine or timolol, respectively. In random sequence, 20 patients (40 eyes) participated in both phases of the study. Pretreatment with timolol significantly reduced the ocular hypotensive effect of epinephrine (from 15.3% to 4.6%); epinephrine pretreatment did not affect the pressure reduction of timolol. Pretreatment with timolol enhanced the mydriatic effect of epinephrine (from 35.8% to 71.9% pupillary dilation); pretreatment with epinephrine resulted in an apparent mydriatic effect for timolol.", 
    "14": "This study was designed to determine the effects of dimethyl-propranolol (UM-272) on myocardial injury after global ischemia of isolated feline hearts. Untreated ischemic hearts developed contracture, resulting in a leftward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Active pressure development in perfused ischemic hearts was significantly depressed compared to preischemic values. Untreated ischemic hearts exhibited increased water, sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca++) contents and depletion of potassium (K+). The Ca++ accumulating ability of cardiac microsomal fractions isolated from untreated ischemic hearts was severely depressed. In hearts treated with UM-272, active ventricular pressure development after ischemia declined to the same extent as in untreated hearts, but ischemic contracture in treated hearts was delayed and completely reversed by reperfusion. Treated hearts were not depleted of K+ and changes in Na+ and Ca++ were significantly less than in untreated hearts. Microsomal Ca++ accumulation in the treated group was well preserved compared to that in untreated hearts. Experiments in which hearts were paced during UM-272 administration suggest that decreased myocardial oxygen consumption contributes substantially to the protective effects of UM-272. In addition, UM-272 may protect the ischemic heart through direct effects on myocardial Ca++ regulating mechanisms.", 
    "15": "The protein binding of phenytoin, propranolol, salicylic acid, warfarin, and bilirubin was determined in heparinized plasma and serum obtained from the same healthy adult subjects. There were no significant differences in the free fraction values of these compounds in plasma and serum. Addition of heparin to serum had no significant effect on protein binding. Contact with Vacutainer stoppers increased the free fraction of the weak base propranolol in serum and plasma but no significant effect on the protein binding of the other, weakly acidic compounds tested. The lack of differences in the protein binding of phenytoin, salicylic acid, warfarin, and bilirubin in human plasma and serum is in contrast with the pronounced differences observed previously in rat serum and plasma.", 
    "16": "The usefulness of an abnormal blood pressure response and a marked ischemic ST-segment depression during exercise testing as predictors of severe coronary artery disease was assessed in 378 consecutive patients who had a maximal symptom-limited exercise test before coronary arteriography. An abnormal blood pressure response occurred in 90 patients. The sensitivity of this response for three-vessel or left main disease was 38.6%, the specificity 87.4% and the predictive value 70%. A marked ischemic ST-segment abnormality (MIST) appeared in 85 patients. The sensitivity of MIST for three-vessel or left main disease was 38.6%, the specificity 89.8% and the predictive value 74.1%. One hundred thirty-eight patients had either an abnormal blood pressure response or a marked ST-segment change. The sensitivity of either response for three-vessel or left main disease was 56.4%, the specificity 78.6%, and the predictive value 66.7%. Exercise duration and ejection fraction were not significantly different in patients with normal or abnormal blood pressure. We conclude that abnormal blood pressure and marked ischemic ST-segment depression during exercise testing are helpful in identifying a subset of patients with advanced coronary artery disease. The physiologic mechanism for these responses is probably exercise-induced ischemia.", 
    "17": "Oral propranolol (160 mg/day) was administered to 19 normal subjects for 2 weeks. Echocardiograms were performed at rest, during graded supine bicycle exercise in 10 subjects and during acute pressure loading with intravenous phenylephrine in the remaining nine subjects. Resting heart rate on propranolol decreased compared with control (52 +/- 8 vs 63 +/- 10 beats/min; p less than 0.001), as did systolic blood pressure (99 +/- 9 vs 107 +/- 9 mm Hg; p less than 0.01). Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was slightly enlarged (48.3 +/- 4.2 vs 47.1 +/- 3.6 mm, p = 0.05), but percent dimensional shortening was unchanged (37 +/- 4 vs 38 +/- 5%). At each stage during supine bicycle exercise, heart rate was slower, blood pressure lower, left ventricular dimensions were larger and percent dimensional shortening was reduced on propranolol by an analysis of variance. In contrast, during acute pressure loading, while the heart rate response to increased blood pressure was blocked by atropine, there was no significant difference in left ventricle size and performance compared with control. We conclude that prolonged oral propranolol therapy has little, if any, intrinsic effect on myocardial performance in normal subjects. Its major action on the heart is competitive inhibition of beta-adrenergic tone, which is most manifest during conditions associated with increased sympathetic tone, such as exercise.", 
    "18": "Effects of pharmacological denervation with propranolol (0.2 mg.kg-1) and/or atropine (0.04 mg.kg-1) on the control system of heart rate during exercise were studied using a frequency domain analysis, to evaluate the cardiac control function of autonomic nervous systems in man. Propranolol decreased the gain of the system in low frequency range and increased the gain slightly in middle and high frequency ranges. The phase angle of the system was advanced over the whole frequency range observed. Atropine decreased and delayed the gain and phase angle, respectively, especially in high frequency range. The combined administration of blockades significantly decreased the gain and delayed the phase angle in the whole and high frequency ranges, respectively. These findings suggest that sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems act nearly independently in controlling heart rate during exercise; that they act in different manners; and that the characteristics of the systems can feasibly be used to estimate clinically the cardiac control function of autonomic nerves in man.", 
    "19": "When D,L-propranolol, 100 mg/kg/day, was added to the drinking water of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), systolic pressures measured with the tail-cuff method fell significantly within 1 month and were almost the same as those in normotensive controls (KNR) by the end of 3 months. This antihypertensive effect was later confirmed by direct recording of phasic aortic pressures from indwelling catheters. Blood pressure was lowered selectively only in SHR and not in KNR; by contrast, body weight, fluid intake, and heart rate always decreased whether the rats were hypertensive or not. Because pressor responses to hypothalamic stimulation in SHR treated with propranolol were reduced while those to injected norepinephrine were unaltered, a peripheral inhibition of cardiovascular reactivity was considered unlikely. Supporting the interpretation that diminished pressor responsiveness was caused by concurrent reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity, frequency of spike potentials recorded from abdominal sympathetic nerves was appreciably lessened in propranolol-treated SHR, as was the vasodepression resulting when autonomic ganglia were pharmacologically blocked with pentolinium. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that prolonged oral administration of propranolol prevents development of spontaneous hypertension in rats by reducing sympathetic vasomotor tons.", 
    "20": "In 14 eyes with open-angle glaucoma, 2% pilocarpine hydrochloride given four times a day was compared with timolol given twice daily in its effect on intraocular pressure around the clock. The findings suggest that the timolol produced a greater reduction in pressure than pilocarpine and that, in 50% of the diurnal curves, the timolol curve showed smaller swings in IOP.", 
    "21": "1 The effects of adrenoceptor blocking drugs on the metabolic responses to adrenaline infusion (1 microgram kg-1 min-1) have been studied in the anaesthetized, fasted cat. 2 Propranolol, in doses (0.25 or 1 mg/kg) which prevented completely adrenaline-induced tachycardia, reduced but did not abolish adrenaline-induced hyperglycaemia. 3 Phentolamine infusion, at a rate (15 micrograms kg-1 min-1 after a priming dose of 2.5 mg/kg) which reversed the pressor effect of adrenaline, reduced but did not abolish adrenaline-induced hyperglycaemia. 4 The continuous infusion of a combination of phentolamine (15 micrograms kg-1 min-1 after a priming dose of 2.5 mg/kg) and propranolol (5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 after a priming dose of 0.25 mg/kg) prevented completely the hyperglycaemia response to adrenaline infusion over a 6 h period. 5 The increase in blood lactate concentration produced by adrenaline was prevented completely by the combined infusion of propranolol and phentolamine but was not modified by phentolamine alone.", 
    "22": "1 The cardiovascular effects of the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, propranolol and acebutolol, on regional coronary blood flow and left ventricular function have been investigated in the conscious dog with developing myocardial infarction. 2 Propranolol (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) or acebutolol (4 to 5 mg/kg) were administered intravenously 2 to 3 h after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. 3 Propranolol or acebutolol administration resulted in a relative increase in flow to the ischaemic area of the myocardium, particularly to the subendocardium. 4 Propranolol produced a greater reduction in heart rate and myocardial contractility than acebutolol. 5 These results demonstrate that beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and increase coronary flow to the ischaemic area of the myocardium after coronary artery occlusion in the conscious dog.", 
    "23": "To assess the functional maturity of adrenergic modulation of plasma concentration of glucose, as well as immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI) secretion in utero, adrenergic agonists with or without beta (propranolol) or alpha (phentolamine) antagonists were infused to the chronically catheterized sheep fetus (n = 35) late in the third trimester. Mean +/- S.E. days at study was 129.5 +/- 1.5; term is 150 days. In 9 separate studies at gestational age 129 +/- 1 days, the infusion of saline for 3 hr was not associated with significant changes in the basal levels of glucose, IRG, or IRI. With epinephrine, 6 microgram/min (n = 6) glucose rose from 16.7 +/- 3.6 to 41.9 +/- 9.7 mg/dl, IRG rose from 75 +/- 8 to 219 +/- 45 pg/ml, and IRI fell from 22.6 +/- 1.7 to 12.7 +/- 3.5 microunits/ml (P less than 0.05 for each). Propranolol alone (n = 4) did not alter basal glucose or IRG but significantly suppressed IRI. Propranolol did, however, markedly attentuate the rise in glucose and IRG while exaggerating the fall in IRI during epinephrine infusion. Qualitatively similar but smaller responses were obtained with epinephrine, 0.4 microgram/min (n = 10). Similarly, elevation of glucose and suppression of IRI was obtained with norepinephrine, 2 microgram/min (n = 5), but IRG levels did not rise significantly. Alpha-Adrenergic blockade alone augmented IRI from 18 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 5 microunits/ml without affecting glucose or IRG concentrations; during alpha blockade, norepinephrine infusion failed to induce the rise in glucose, IRG remained unchanged, and IRI remained elevated (n = 5). 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, 200 mg IV over 30 min, did not affect glucose, IRG, or IRI (n = 5). Thus, appropriate adrenergic modulation of plasma concentrations of glucose, and of IRG and IRI secretion is established in the third trimester.", 
    "24": "Pleural effusions develop following changes in capillary permeability, capillary hydrostatic pressure, plasma colloid osmotic pressure, or lymphatic drainage. Generalized fluid retention or a transudate suggests a systemic cause while an exudate suggests a local cause. The diagnosis can usually be established by clinical assessment, chest radiography, analysis of pleural fluid, pleural biopsy, and appropriate special investigations. When no cause can be found, particular care should be taken to exclude secondary carcinoma, tuberculosis, pulmonary infarction, and mesothelioma; the patient should be followed-up. Symptomatic malignant effusions may be managed initially by basal intercostal tube drainage alone. For recurrences, local instillation first of tetracycline and then of mustine may be tried. Pleurectomy should be considered if the prognosis is otherwise good.", 
    "25": "The effect of alpha-adrenergic stimulation by IV adrenaline and propranolol infusion upon basal insulin and growth hormone secretion was studied in six chronic alcoholics during alcohol withdrawal, two alcoholics recently admitted to hospital with alcohol-induced hypoglycaemia and twelve healthy subjects. In all healthy subjects a decline in basal insulin (mean +/- SEM decremental area 166 +/- 19) and an increase in growth hormone (mean +/- SEM incremental area 527 +/- 164) was found. In the two alcoholics admitted to hospital with alcohol hypoglycaemia, no consistent change occurred in basal insulin and basal growth hormone concentrations during alpha-adrenergic stimulation. In the other alcoholics a decrease in basal insulin (mean +/- SEM decremental area 91 +/- 13.5) was found, but this decrease was significantly less (p less than 0.05) than in healthy subjects. Growth hormone did not change significantly in these alcoholics. It is concluded that disturbances in the alpha-adrenergic modulation of basal insulin and growth hormone secretions are common in alcoholics in a withdrawal state. The implication of this finding for the occurrence of alcohol-induced hypoglycaemic coma is discussed.", 
    "26": "There are very few areas of clinical pharmacology being pursued as vigorously as hypertension. Numerous new drugs are being discovered and tested both in United States and overseas. The most promising new antihypertensive drugs seem to fall into the angiotensin-renin blocker group and those affecting the sodium-volume axis in hypertensive patients. We can look forward to newer agents that are efficacious as monotherapy and on a daily or twice daily dosage regimen for the treatment of the vast majority of hypertensive patients. There is further hope that preoperative evaluation with angiotensin blockers in patients with renovascular hypertension may improve the predictability of successful renal bypass surgery.", 
    "27": "1 Labetalol has been compared with propranolol in a double-blind, double-dummy study of 24 patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension. 2 Two patients were unable to tolerate propranolol and five labetalol, because of symptom side effects; this difference was not significant (P greater than 0.1). 3 On a self-administered questionnaire, labetalol was associated with a greater number of side effects per patient than propranolol, but no individual side effect was significantly more common with either drug. 4 There was no difference in the number of spontaneously reported side effects between the two drugs. 5 Both drugs impaired pulmonary function, but propranolol caused a greater reduction than labetalol after 8 weeks of treatment. 6 We conclude that labetalol and propranolol are similarly effective and acceptable to the patient.", 
    "28": "Chronic beta-receptor blockade has been reported to inhibit right ventricular hypertrophy in rats at high altitude. If so, we wanted to determine whether beta-receptor blockade or some other drug action were involved and whether the heart, the lung vessels, or blood alterations were affected. In rats, chronic treatment with DL-propranolol (2 mg/kg ip once daily) reduced right ventricular hypertrophy and polycythemia of chronic high altitude. D-Propranolol and metoprolol did not reduce hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy or polycythemia. In isolated lungs from low-altitude rats treated chronically with DL-propranolol or with D-propranolol the pressor response to acute hypoxia was blunted. Chronic DL-propranolol blunted the acute hypoxic pressor response and angiotensin II induced vasoconstriction in lungs from high-altitude rats. Two effects of DL-propranolol treatment were seen: 1) blockade of beta 2-adrenergic receptors, which reduced the right ventricular hypertrophy of high altitude through reduction of hematocrit; and 2) a non-beta-effect, which reduced vascular responsiveness to acute hypoxia in the isolated lung preparation.", 
    "29": "To seek possible mechanisms for the relative bradycardia induced by physical conditioning we studied the effects of an eight-week swimming programme upon cardiac beta-adrenergic and muscarinic-cholinergic receptors in rats. A training effect was documented by an increase in the ratio of heart wet weight to body weight in the conditioned animals compared with sedentary controls. Cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors as assessed in crude membrane fractions by the binding of (-) (3H) dihydroalprenolol did not differ significantly in either number or affinity in conditioned hearts (30 +/- 2 fmol.mg-1 protein; KD = 1.4 +/- 0.1 nmol.litre-1) compared with sedentary hearts (33 +/- 2 fmol.mg-1; KD = 1.5 +/- 2 nmol.litre-1). Likewise cardiac muscarinic-cholinergic receptors as assessed by the binding of (3H) quinuclidinyl benzilate to crude cardiac membranes did not differ significantly in either number or affinity in conditioned hearts (116 +/- 6 fmol.mg-1 protein; KD = 0.17 +/- 0.03 nmol.litre-1) compared with sedentary hearts (125 +/- 11 fmol.mg-1; KD = 0.19 +/- 0.03 nmol.litre-1). We conclude that the bradycardia of physical training is probably mediated by mechanisms other than alterations in cardiac beta-adrenergic or muscarinic-cholinergic receptors.", 
    "30": "The present study was conducted to assess the effects of beta-adrenergic manipulation within the central nucleus of the amygdala on Pavlovian heart rate conditioning in the rabbit. Administration of the beta-adrenergic antagonist dl-propranolol into the central nucleus impaired the acquisition of conditioned heart rate responding compared to a vehicle injected control group. No significant effects of dl-propranolol on either baseline heart rate or on the heart rate orienting response were observed. The effect of dl-propranolol on conditioning exhibited stereospecificity, and animals receiving combined intracerebral injections of dl-propranolol and the beta-adrenergic agonist 1-isoproterenol did not exhibit comparable conditioning impairments. In addition, dl-propranolol administration dorsal to the central nucleus or into amygdala sites anterior or posterior to the central nucleus was less effective. These results support the interpretation that beta-adrenergic activity within the central nucleus region of the amygdala complex contributes to the acquisition of classically conditioned heart rate responding.", 
    "31": "The different muscle layers at the human uterotubal junction (UTJ) were mechanically separated, and 1-mm wide muscle strips were isolated and mounted in organ chambers for isometric recording of contractile activity. It was found that the adrenergic neurotransmitter noradrenalin elicited an inhibition of the spontaneous phasic activity in the inner longitudinal and the intermediate circular layers but caused a clear-cut excitatory response in the outer, spiral-shaped (uterine) layer. The excitatory response was totally blocked by treatment with phenoxybenzamine, an alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, whereas the inhibitory effects were abolished after pretreatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. The data demonstrate a differentiated distribution of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in the smooth musculature at the proximal end of the tubal isthmus. It is suggested that this arrangement might serve an important purpose in the physiologic control of ovum transport in women.", 
    "32": "The concentrations of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors were determined in membranes prepared from the left ventricles and right atria of cat and guinea-pig hearts. The relative densities of the two receptor subtypes were determined by analyzing the kinetics of inhibition of specific [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol binding by drugs previously found to show in vitro selectivity for beta-1 or beta-2 receptors. The right atria (including the sinoatrial node) from hearts of both species contained both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Although beta-1 receptors predominated, approximately one-quarter of the beta adrenergic receptors in the atria were of the beta-2 subtype. The ventricles contained essentially only beta-1 adrenergic receptors. The densities of beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors were similar in the atria from both species. The cat left ventricle, however, contained twice as many receptors of the beta-1 type than did the ventricle of the guinea-pig heart. These results may explain previous findings that beta-2 selective drugs have more of an effect on chronotropy than on inotropy.", 
    "33": "Endogenous release of epinephrine after stress as well as exogenous epinephrine infusion are known to result in impaired glucose tolerance. Previous studies of man and animals have demonstrated that this effect of epinephrine results from inhibition of insulin secretion and augmentation of hepatic glucose production. However, the effect of epinephrine on tissue sensitivity to insulin, and the relative contributions of peripheral vs. hepatic resistance to impaired insulin action, have not been defined. Nine young normal-weight subjects were studied with the insulin clamp technique. Plasma insulin was raised by approximately 100 muU/ml while plasma glucose concentration was maintained at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion. Under these conditions of euglycemia, the amount of glucose metabolized equals the glucose infusion rate and is a measure of tissue sensitivity to insulin. Subjects received four studies: (a) insulin (42.6 mU/m(2).min), (b) insulin plus epinephrine (0.05 mug/kg.min), (c) insulin plus epinephrine plus propranolol (1.43 mug/kg.min), and (d) insulin plus propranolol. During insulin administration alone, glucose metabolism averaged 5.49+/-0.58 mg/kg.min. When epinephrine was infused with insulin, glucose metabolism fell by 41% to 3.26 mg/kg.min (P < 0.001). After insulin alone, hepatic glucose production declined by 92% to 0.16+/-0.08 mg/kg.min. Addition of epinephrine was associated with a delayed and incomplete suppression of glucose production (P < 0.01) despite plasma insulin levels >100 muU/ml. When propranolol was administered with epinephrine, total glucose metabolism was restored to control values and hepatic glucose production suppressed normally. Propranolol alone had no effect on insulin-mediated glucose metabolism. These results indicate that epinephrine, acting primarily through a beta-adrenergic receptor, markedly impairs tissue sensitivity to an increase in plasma insulin levels, and that this effect results from both peripheral and hepatic resistance to the action of insulin.", 
    "34": "THE PRESENT STUDIES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ASSESS THE ADRENERGIC MECHANISMS BY WHICH EPINEPHRINE STIMULATES GLUCOSE PRODUCTION AND SUPPRESSES GLUCOSE CLEARANCE IN MAN: epinephrine (50 ng/kg per min) was infused for 180 min alone and during either alpha (phentolamine) or beta (propranolol)-adrenergic blockade in normal subjects under conditions in which plasma insulin, glucagon, and glucose were maintained at comparable levels by infusion of somatostatin (100 mug/h), insulin (0.2 mU/kg per min), and variable amounts of glucose. In additional experiments, to control for the effects of the hyperglycemia caused by epinephrine, variable amounts of glucose without epinephrine were infused along with somatostatin and insulin to produce hyperglycemia comparable with that observed during infusion of epinephrine. This glucose infusion suppressed glucose production from basal rates of 1.8+/-0.1 to 0.0+/-0.1 mg/kg per min (P < 0.01), but did not alter glucose clearance. During infusion of epinephrine, glucose production increased transiently from a basal rate of 1.8+/-0.1 to a maximum of 3.0+/-0.2 mg/kg per min (P < 0.01) at min 30, and returned to near basal rates at min 180 (1.9+/-0.1 mg/kg per min). Glucose clearance decreased from a basal rate of 2.0+/-0.1 to 1.5+/-0.2 ml/kg per min at the end of the epinephrine infusion (P < 0.01). Infusion of phentolamine did not alter these effects of epinephrine on glucose production and clearance. In contrast, infusion of propranolol completely prevented the suppression of glucose clearance by epinephrine, and inhibited the stimulation of glucose production by epinephrine by 80+/-6% (P < 0.001). These results indicate that, under conditions in which plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon are maintained constant, epinephrine stimulates glucose production and inhibits glucose clearance in man predominantly by beta adrenergic mechanisms.", 
    "35": "The physiology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of atenolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent, were evaluated in 10 patients with stable angina pectoris in a single-blind, dose-ranging study. After a 1-month control placebo period, atenolol was administered once daily at dosages of 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg for 2-week periods. All patients had fewer anginal attacks and consumed fewer nitroglycerin tablets than mg for 2-week periods. All patients had fewer anginal attacks and consumed fewer nitroglycerin tablets than during the placebo period. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG recordings showed a decrease in mean hourly heart rate throughout the dosing period, with preservation of diurnal variation. Maximal, symptom-limited, treadmill exercise tests performed 3 hours after drug ingestion showed significantly increased exercise time and decreased double products for all doses, but especially with 100-mg and 200-mg doses. Exercise time 24 hours after drug ingestion continued to show a decrease in maximum heart rate and double product, with 100-mg and 200-mg doses again being most effective. Atenolol serum levels correlated with percent reduction in exercise heart rate and increased exercise time. Serum levels rose linearly, with an average elimination half-life of about 10 hours after chronic oral dosing. Thus, atenolol was an effective antianginal agent and suppressed resting and exercise-stressed heart rate for 24 hours after ingestion when given in a 100-mg or 200-mg dose once daily.", 
    "36": "1 The inhibition constants evaluated by binding assays for ten beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents and two beta-adrenoceptor agonists, were compared with the pA2 and pD2 values determined in vitro and in vivo. 2 There was only a limited correlation between beta 1 or beta 2 selectivities observed with the different methods. 3 Selectivity is generally less pronounced in binding assays than for in vivo and in vitro experiments.", 
    "37": "1 Young rabbits were treated for 30 days or 6 weeks with propranolol or oxprenolol to provide dose-levels similar to those used clinically. 2 Relative to litter matched controls the treated rabbits exhibited a reduced rate of growth. 3 Morphometric studies showed that prolonged beta-adrenoceptor blockade had no effect on the myofibrillar volume as a proportion of cell volume. 4 Prolonged beta-blockade increased the proportion of the extracellular space occupied by vascular tissue.", 
    "38": "The severity of the functional obstruction of the outflow tract of an idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis is essentially determined by the contractility of the myocardium, the left-ventricular volume and the peripheral vascular resistance. Though in the acute experiment a clear reduction of the degree of stenosis by beta-receptor-blockers may be proved the long-term results of such a therapy are unsatisfactory, particularly in patients with obstruction in rest. The use of calcium antagonists seems to promise more favourable results. The progression of the disease is, however, scarcely influencible by pharmacological measures alone. Nitrobodies are not suitable for treatment and glycosides should be used only within a manifest insufficiency of the left heart. An effective reduction or removal of the ventriculo-ventricular pressure gradient as well as a decrease of the left-ventricular telediastolic pressure may be achieved on operative way. There is an indication to this, when the complaints increase despite medicamentous therapy. At present the transaortic myotomy under use of the heart-lung-machine is regarded as most favourable method. A simultaneous or only substitute of the mitral valve should be restricted only to those cases which, apart from the functional, still show an organically conditioned insufficiency of the mitral valve. The early and late results of the palliative surgical interventions are very favourable in experienced centres. However, secure long-term prognoses may not yet be derived from this.", 
    "39": "Both systemic and central administration of theophylline and caffeine produced a dose-dependent rise in rectal temperature at ambient temperatures of 8, 22 and 30 degrees C. The hyperthermia in response to either xanthine was brought about by an increase in metabolic heat production. In addition, their administration produced behavioral excitation, cutaneous vasodilation (as estimated by an increase in the foot and tail skin temperatures) and diuresis. There was no change in respiratory evaporative heat loss. Probably, the hyperthermia induced by the two drugs was due to behavioral excitation leading to an increased metabolism at the ambient temperatures studied. Furthermore, either destruction of central catecholaminergic nerve fibres (with 6-hydroxydopamine) or blockade of alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic (with phentolamine and haloperidol) receptors antagonized the xanthine-induced hyperthermia. The data suggest that these xanthines elicit a central activation of both adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors via release of endogenous catecholamines that leads to behavioral excitation and hyperthermia in rats.", 
    "40": "1. The alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine, was administered intravenously, to conscious or anaesthetized rats, before or after the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propanolol. 2. The bradycardia which followed the combined administration of propranolol and phentolamine exceeded that induced by propranolol alone, yet the hypotensive effect of phentolamine was attenuated by propranolol. 3. The results are compatible with the concept that a significant part of the hypotensive effect of phentolamine is mediated by stimulation of vascular beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "41": "A series of 25 aryloxypropanolamines containing the 3-indolyl-tert-butyl [i.e., 1,1-dimethyl-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl] or substituted 3-indolyl-tert-butyl moiety as the N substituent is reported. These compounds have been tested for antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist action in conscious normotensive rats, vasodilating activity in ganglion-blocked rats with blood pressure maintained by angiotensin II infusion, and for intrinsic sympathomimetic action (ISA) in reserpinized rats. Some of the compounds exhibit antihypertensive activity in combination with beta adrenergic receptor antagonist and vasodilating action. The structure--activity relationships in these tests are discussed.", 
    "42": "Hypertension in the elderly may be of the classical or isolated systolic type. The former is amenable to therapy, and reduction in blood pressure clearly decreases morbidity and mortality. Isolated systolic hypertension is an undesirable risk factor, but the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy for the problem is as yet unknown. Although various physiologic parameters change with age, diuretics, methyldopa, and beta-adrenergic blockers are generally safe in the elderly and are recommended.", 
    "43": "The pharmacokinetics of metoprolol have been studied in a group of patients with varying degrees of renal impairment and in healthy subjects after administration of 20 mg of metoprolol tartrate intravenously and 50 mg orally in a single dose and during steady-state conditions. There were no significant differences in the extent of bioavailability or rate of elimination of the drug between the 2 groups. The fraction of the oral dose systemically available during steady-state was 59 +/- 9% in the renal patients and 55 +/- 7% in the control group. Total body clearance in the patients with renal failure was 1.0 +/- 0.1 L/min and in the healthy subjects it was 0.8 +/- 0.1 L/min. The corresponding values for the elimination half-life were 4.6 +/- 1.2h and 4.1 +/- 1.0h, respectively. The beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect of metoprolol (determined as percent reduction of exercise heart rate) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups during steady-state conditions. The effect on exercise heart rate was linearly related to the log of the plasma concentration of metoprolol. The relationship was identical for the single dose and during steady-state conditions, indicating that accumulation of metabolites in patients with renal failure does not influence the beta-blocking properties of metoprolol.", 
    "44": "The effect of intermittent high altitude (IHA) hypoxia on the myocardium and lesser circulation was investigated in adult male Wistar rats. IHA can induce intermittent pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy in a relatively short time. Even marked pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular changes can be normalized when rats are removed from the hypoxic atmosphere. At the beginning of the exposure to IHA acute myocardial necrotic changes were found; prolongation of IHA did not lead to further acute lesions. Experimentally induced CO polycythemia leads to mild pulmonary hypertension; IHA-induced pulmonary hypertension may, thus, be partly due to polycythemia. Beta blocking agents are able to decrease chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, hypertensive changes in the pulmonary circulation, the degree of right ventricular hypertrophy, and necrotic myocardial changes.", 
    "45": "We have tested the beta adrenergic receptor theory of bronchial asthma by determining the number and affinity of binding sites of the beta adrenergic radioligand [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and the activity of adenylate cyclase in broken cell preparations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). We studied 31 control subjects (group 1), 30 asthmatics receiving no systemic adrenergic medication (group 2), and 17 asthmatics receiving adrenergic agonists systemically (group 3). Control subjects and asthmatics taking no adrenergic drugs bound similar amounts of DHA at 0.5 nM and 30 nM DHA and had about 900 binding sites per PMN. In contrast, asthmatics receiving adrenergic agonists had a >70% decrease in their number of DHA binding sites per PMN (254+/-57). In a subset of our three groups of subjects (eight from group 1, six from group 2, and five from group 3) we measured DHA binding at several DHA concentrations and found similar values (0.4-0.7 nM) for the dissociation constant of DHA among these subjects. In further studies we examined the interaction of the agonist (-)-isoproterenol with beta adrenergic receptors in 8 normal subjects and 10 asthmatics not receiving adrenergic medication. We tested the ability of isoproterenol to compete for DHA binding sites and to stimulate adenylate cyclase in sonicates prepared from PMN and examined under identical conditions. The dissociation constants for the competition of isoproterenol for DHA binding sites in normal and asthmatic subjects were virtually identical ( approximately 1.0 muM). In addition, the (activation constant) values for stimulation of adenylate cyclase were similar (0.16-0.19 muM) in the two groups of subjects.Thus, these data suggest that asthma per se is not associated with alteration in either the number or affinity of beta adrenergic receptors in PMN. Our findings indicate that previous reports of abnormal beta adrenergic receptor function in asthmatic patients may in part be explained by prior treatment of such patients with adrenergic agonists. Because the asthmatics who received adrenergic agonists in our study tended to be more ill and to receive additional medication compared to subjects in group 2, we cannot rule out unequivocally that severe asthma may be associated with decreased binding to beta adrenergic receptors. Nevertheless, we conclude that beta adrenergic receptors on PMN from asthmatics are relatively normal unless such patients are treated with adrenergic agonists.", 
    "46": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a primary disease of the myocardium. It usually involves hypertrophy of the septum and the outflow tract of the left ventricle, but it may also occur in all other areas of the ventricles. In a first step, the diastolic performance of the heart falls due to the impaired elasticity of the myocardium, later the contractile function in systole is also affected because of the slow filling of the ventricle. Tachycardial dysrhythmias and left-sided failure are frequent causes of death. Besides drug-therapy with beta-receptor blockers and calcium antagonists, surgical treatment is gaining increasingly in importance since observations of the clinical results are encouraging. With the M-mode echography an diagnostic method is available which is highly efficient.", 
    "47": "We studied the role of catecholamines in the regulation of potassium homeostasis in nine healthy subjects given intravenous potassium chloride (0.5 meq per kilogram of body weight) in the presence and absence of propranolol. Potassium infusion elevated serum potassium 0.6 +/- 0.09 meq per liter (mean +/-S.E.M.). Addition of propranolol augmented the rise (0.9 +/- 0.05 meq per liter) and prolonged the elevation in serum potassium without decreasing urinary potassium excretion. In a separate study, the same potassium load was administered with a concomitant infusion of epinephrine in five subjects. Epinephrine markedly blunted the increment in serum potassium (0.1 +/- 0.06 meq per liter) while reducing renal potassium excretion. Plasma aldosterone was not altered by the experimental procedures. Serum insulin fell minimally in the presence of propranolol but was unaffected by epinephrine. beta-Adrenergic blockade impairs and epinephrine enhances extrarenal disposal of an acute potassium load. These findings suggest that in patients with impaired potassium disposal, the risk of hyperkalemia may be increased when sympathetic blockade is induced."
