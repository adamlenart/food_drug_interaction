    "0": "The experiments reported here were performed to characterize the effects of acetaldehyde on membrane potentials (MP) of sinus node subsidiary pacemaker fibers in the absence and presence of adrenergic and cholinergic blockade. Guinea pig sinoatrial preparations were superfused with Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C while electrically stimulated at 5 Hz. Intracellular microelectrodes were used to record the MP of sinus node subsidiary pacemaker fibers. Acetaldehyde 3 x 10(-6) M and 3 x 10(-3) M had no effect on maximum diastolic potential (MDP), while 3 x 10(-5) M and 3 x 10(-2) M exerted a depolarizing effect on the MDP, without affecting the overshoot (OS). The fall in MDP was associated with a reduction in the amplitude of the action potential (AAP) and the maximum velocity of phase 0 (Vmax 0). The depressant effect of acetaldehyde on MDP was not abolished by adrenergic blockers or atropine. Concentrations of acetaldehyde between 3 x 10(-5) and 3 x 10(-2) M prolonged the action potential duration (APD). Acetaldehyde 3 x 10(-3) M did not affect MDP even in the presence of atropine or propranolol. The APD-prolonging effect of acetaldehyde was not abolished by adrenergic blockers. In summary, the actions of acetaldehyde on MDP and APD were independent of adrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "1": "The study aimed to compare the effects of thoracic epidural anaesthesia (TEA) with those of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, metoprolol, on central haemodynamics in conscious rats with acute myocardial infarction. During methohexital anaesthesia, appropriate vascular catheters were inserted, a thoracic epidural catheter was implanted and the left coronary artery was ligated. A recovery period of 1-2 h elapsed after termination of surgery and anaesthesia. Experiments were performed on four separate groups of animals (A-D). In Group A (n = 10) mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (CO) were measured, and stroke volume (SV) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) were calculated before and 10-15 min after the induction of TEA (bupivacaine 5 mg.ml-1). In Group B (n = 6) left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and maximal dP/dt were recorded as in Group A. In Group C (n = 10) central haemodynamics were measured 10 min after i.v. metoprolol (0.5 mg.kg-1) and again 10-15 min after the addition of TEA. In Group D (n = 6) LVEDP and max dP/dt were measured as in Group C. The reduction in CO, SV, HR and max dP/dt was of the same magnitude with TEA and metoprolol. TEA lowered MAP by 17%, while metoprolol did not change MAP. Metoprolol caused an increase in LVEDP from 20.8 +/- 1.8 to 27.5 +/- 2.7 mmHg (2.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 kPa) (P less than 0.01), while TEA induced a decrease in LVEDP from 24.2 +/- 1.4 to 17.8 +/- 1.6 mmHg (3.2 +/- 0.2 to 2.4 +/- 0.2 kPa) (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The results with the K+ channel blocking compounds are encouraging because they show a slight structural change in a parent blocking compound can dramatically alter the type of K+ channel blocked by a drug. Our work continues in an effort to determine a more detailed relationship between structural features of a blocker and the type of K+ channel effected. We hope to be able to reveal the requirements for potent and specific blockers of each of these channel types. Selective blockade of these, and other, K+ channels in heart and smooth muscle cells, a goal suggested by the preliminary results presented here, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies of K+ channels. Our experiments also show that temperature can be used to separate the beta-adrenergic regulation of ICa and IDR suggesting different modulatory mechanisms. The results with forskolin show this separation exists at the level of elevated cAMP. This suggests that the K+ and Ca++ channel proteins may be phosphorylated by the same cAMP-dependent protein kinase but with different temperature-sensitive kinetics. It will be interesting to see if this temperature-sensitivity extends to phosphorylation of the channel during intracellular application of cAMP-dependent protein kinase.", 
    "3": "Five pregnant Rhesus monkeys were catheterized in the hepatic and femoral veins. They were simultaneously given 168 or 176 micrograms of 3H-metoprolol intravenously, and 9 mg of metoprolol per kg body weight orally. The same procedure was repeated a few months after delivery. Analyses of the unlabelled drug in blood were made by gas-chromatography and of the 3H-labelled metoprolol, by liquid scintillation. The apparent volume of distribution as well as the terminal half-lives of metoprolol were in the same range during pregnancy and in non-pregnancy. The oral bioavailability of metoprolol was lower (6-22%) during pregnancy than in non-pregnancy (9-49%). The apparent oral clearance and the intrinsic hepatic clearance were in a similar range although there was a greater variation in the intrinsic clearance values. The former clearance estimate was lower in the non-pregnant state only for three of the five animals. The systemic clearance varied very little and was in the same range during pregnancy and in non-pregnancy. The changes in apparent oral clearance and in oral bioavailability of metoprolol between the pregnant and non-pregnant Rhesus monkey are similar to the changes observed in pregnant women, although the absolute values are different.", 
    "4": "In rat hypothalamic slices, antagonism by L-DOPA methyl ester and (-)-propranolol against L-DOPA-induced facilitation of endogenous noradrenaline (NA) release was characterized under the inhibition of dopadecarboxylase. L-DOPA at 10 nM to 1 microM facilitated the evoked NA release in a concentration-dependent manner. L-DOPA methyl ester (3, 10 and 30 nM) progressively shifted the concentration-release curve for L-DOPA to the right: Schild plots gave a straight line with a slope of 1.00 and pA2 was 8.9. This antagonistic action was not mimicked by L-phenylalanine, a substrate for L-DOPA transport system. In contrast, 10 and 100 nM propranolol concentration-dependently reduced the maximal effect of L-DOPA without rightward shift of the concentration-release curve. L-DOPA methyl ester is a potent competitive antagonist for the action of L-DOPA, and the recognition site of L-DOPA differs from presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "5": "The influence of drugs improving sympathoadrenal system status on natural killer (NK) functional activity was studied in lung cancer patients. The activity of adenosine-metabolizing enzymes (adenosine deaminase and 5'-nucleotidase) in NK cells was found significantly altered, suggesting the involvement of this phenomenon in decreasing NK activity under tumor growth. Pharmacological correction of sympathoadrenal system status was followed by an increase in NK functional activity in lung cancer patients.", 
    "6": "The authors write in favour of giving a personal touch to the antihypertensive treatment according to the clinical, biological and hemodynamic state of each hypertensive patient. They present a course of medicinal and non medicinal measures adapted to eleven kinds of hypertensive patients. Doing this, they bring out the privileged directions of a diuretic, a beta-blocker, an alpha-blocker, a central acting sympatholytic agent, a calcium channel blocker and a angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "7": "Male mice consumed liquid alcohol diets containing 25%, 10% or 0% ethanol-derived calories (EDC). Animals receiving the 10 and 0% EDC diets were pair fed to those consuming the 25% EDC diet. After 7 or 14 weeks of consumption, males were bred to non-treated females. Offspring were tested for swimming behavior at 75 days of age. Offspring sired by alcohol-consuming males were more immobile regardless of duration of paternal alcohol consumption or housing conditions (group or isolated). Imipramine (5, 15 mg/kg) reversed this effect such that after drug treatment, alcohol-sired offspring were less immobile than controls. Propranolol (1, 3 mg/kg) eliminated the group differences. Yohimbine (1, 10 mg/kg) significantly increased immobility in all groups but did not reverse the effects of paternal alcohol consumption. Metergoline (1 mg/kg) increased immobility in all groups but did not reverse the effects of paternal alcohol exposure. When rat offspring of alcohol-consuming fathers were tested, their swimming behavior was opposite to that of mice (i.e., rats were less immobile). However, as observed in mice, the effect was reversed by imipramine. These results extend the evidence for paternally mediated behavioral mutagenesis. They also indicate that the direction of induced changes are species dependent and that some of these effects, regardless of direction of change, are mediated by neurochemical changes sensitive to imipramine.", 
    "8": "Nicardipine is an investigational dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker. In the present study, 21 patients with severe hypertension were treated with oral nicardipine, alone or in combination with beta-blockers and diuretics for 4-5 weeks, following initial control of their blood pressure with intravenous nicardipine. Each of the 21 patients had a satisfactory response to intravenous nicardipine which was administered as an infusion following initial blood pressure lowering. At 1 h prior to discontinuation of the intravenous treatment, oral nicardipine therapy was begun as a 40 mg dose. Oral nicardipine, 40 mg t.i.d., was continued for the remainder of hospitalization and for a 4-5-week outpatient follow-up period. The dose of oral nicardipine was downtitrated and additional antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blocking agents and/or diuretics, were added to maintain blood pressure in an acceptable range. Compared to baseline, mean supine systolic blood pressure was lowered significantly (p less than 0.001) by 57 mmHg at the end of intravenous maintenance and by 50 mmHg at the end of oral treatment. Likewise, significant (p less than 0.001) decreases in diastolic blood pressure of 43 and 32 mmHg, respectively, were observed for the same time periods. At the end of oral treatment, 6 patients remained on nicardipine monotherapy, 8 patients were on two-drug therapy and 7 patients required three-drug therapy. Side-effects were mild except for a moderate headache reported in one patient during intravenous treatment. From these observations we conclude that oral nicardipine is a useful new agent for initial, single treatment of chronic severe hypertension, although a significant number of patients eventually need additional antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "9": "Phosphate deprivation causes a resistance to the phosphaturic effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The present study evaluated the role of the beta-adrenergic system in this resistance phenomenon. In clearance experiments performed on acutely thyroparathyroidectomized male Sprague-Dawley rats, the phosphaturic response to PTH was determined in the presence and absence of propranolol in rats fed a low-phosphate diet (LPD) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 days. Fractional excretion of phosphate (FEPi) in control rats fed a normal-phosphate diet (NPD) increased from 4.37 +/- 1.6 to 38.5 +/- 3.4% in response to PTH infusion. Propranolol did not change FEPi in NPD animals in the absence or in the presence of PTH (2.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 36.7 +/- 1.6%). LPD resulted in a gradual decrease in the phosphaturic response to PTH infusion as compared with NPD animals. PTH increased FEPi to 24.2 +/- 6.0% after one-half day of LPD, but when the infusion was supplemented with propranolol, PTH increased FEPi to 38.0 +/- 4.7%, similar to that in NPD animals. In the group fed LPD for one day, PTH increased FEPi to 16.9 +/- 4.3%, whereas in the presence of propranolol FEPi was restored to a similar level as in the NPD group (36.0 +/- 5.9%). Two days of LPD markedly decreased FEPi in response to PTH to 7.9 +/- 3.8% as compared with NPD rats, and propranolol infusion did not change this value significantly. Three and 4 days of LPD induced complete resistance to the phosphaturic effect of PTH in the presence as well as in the absence of propranolol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "1. Mice were isolated for 7-9 days. An isolated mouse and a mouse reared in group showed a difference in their behaviour when observed together under an inverted beaker. The isolated mouse makes one half escape attempts in regard to the grouped mouse. This is considered as a social behavioural deficit. 2. 1- 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl piperazine (TFMPP), 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP) and 5-methoxy-3 (1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl) 1-H indole (RU-24969) activating preferentially the 5-HT1B receptors increased the number of escape attempts of the isolated mice up to the level of grouped mice. 3. Penbutolol, a beta-blocking drug acting also at 5-HT1 receptors, devoid of effect when given alone, antagonized significantly and dose-dependently the effects of TFMPP, m-CPP and RU-24969. 4. The interaction between TFMPP and five various serotonin antagonists was examined. Neither the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserine, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930, the 5-HT1C receptor antagonists mianserin and cyproheptadine antagonized the effect of TFMPP. The neuroleptic spiperone decreased by itself the number of escape attempts and opposed the TFMPP effect. 5. Taken together, these results suggest that the isolation-induced social behavioural deficit may be considered as a behavioural model responsive to 5-HT1B agonists.", 
    "11": "We examined whether the distribution of propranolol (PL) exhibits stereoselectivity. (+)-, (-)- or (+/-)-PL was administered by i.v. bolus injection (5 or 10 mg/kg) to rats. The concentrations of PL enantiomers in plasma (Cp) and tissues (e.g., lung, heart, brain, kidney, muscle and gastrointestinal tract) were determined at 5, 10, 30, 60 and 120 min after administration by chiral stationary-phase liquid chromatography. Plasma protein binding of PL enantiomers was evaluated by ultrafiltration. Values of tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient and tissue-to-plasma-free fraction were obtained. Cp for (+)-PL was consistently higher than that of (-)-PL in plasma. In contrast, (-)-PL showed a significantly higher distribution than (+)-PL in all tissues observed (P less than .05) at 60 min after administration of the racemate. As a result, the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient-Cp curve was markedly different for the two enantiomers. However, because the plasma-free fraction of (+)-PL was less than that of (-)-PL, no remarkable difference was found between the concentration-dependent tissue-to-plasma-free concentration curves for the two enantiomers. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the uptake or binding of PL enantiomers to tissues is saturable and not stereoselective. Therefore, the apparent stereoselective tissue distribution of PL seems to be caused mainly by the difference in plasma protein binding of its enantiomers.", 
    "12": "By uni- and multivariate analysis, predictors of surgical mortality and postoperative angina were identified retrospectively in 189 patients having had coronary arterial bypass surgery over the period 1978-1984. After modification of these risk factors, surgical outcome was followed up in another 178 patients undergoing operation from 1985 to 1987. The surgical mortality of 7% in the first series was closely associated with postoperative signs of acute myocardial injury. All deaths occurred in patients having at least 3 out of 5 pre- and peroperative risk factors: triple vessel/left main coronary arterial disease, incomplete revascularization, no propranolol treatment, Bretschneider cardioplegia other than \"HTP\"-solution with blood preperfusion and perioperative vasopressor support. The procedures of cardiac protection were modified. St Thomas multidose potassium cardioplegia and general hypothermia were introduced, perioperative propranolol treatment increased and bypass time decreased. Improved cardiac protection with this regime was seen in the patients operated in 1985-1987 when compared with the first series with regard to perioperative vasopressor support (8 vs 33%, P less than 0.001), spontaneous operative defibrillation (72 vs 52%, P less than 0.001), postoperative arrhythmias (20 vs 43%, P less than 0.001), peak levels of serum enzymes (P less than 0.001), myocardial infarction (7 vs 19%, P less than 0.001) and hospital mortality (2 vs 7%, P less than 0.05). The incidence of freedom from symptoms at 3 months was also increased in the patients undergoing operation from 1985 to 1987 (72 vs 61%, P less than 0.05). Even small centers can improve their surgical outcome by carefully analysing their own results and modifying the identified risk factors.", 
    "13": "The catecholamine (CA) response to light before and after propranolol therapy was studied in 25 migrainous subjects. Before therapy an abnormal CA response to light consisting of a rise in epinephrine excretion and a depression in norepinephrine (NE) excretion was noticed in migrainous patients. After propranolol administration (60 mg daily for 10 days) the post-photic augmentation in epinephrine excretion and the post-photic depression in NE excretion no longer occurred. As epinephrine discharge may be pathogenetic for migraine attack, the favorable effect of propranolol in migraine therapy could be due to its ability to prevent the epinephrine release induced by light or other stimuli.", 
    "14": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of resting vagal tone on accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections. Atropine (0.04 mg/kg) was administered to 13 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and was found to have the following effects on the accessory AV connection: the anterograde block cycle length shortened from 305 +/- 51 to 279 +/- 54 msec (mean +/- SD; p less than 0.001); the retrograde block cycle length shortened from 288 +/- 57 to 251 +/- 50 msec (p less than 0.001); and the effective refractory period measured at a basic drive cycle length of 400 msec shortened from 295 +/- 45 to 265 +/- 47 msec in the anterograde direction (p less than 0.001) and from 283 +/- 18 to 261 +/- 12 msec in the retrograde direction (p less than 0.01). During atrial fibrillation, the mean ventricular cycle length decreased from 434 +/- 88 to 352 +/- 56 msec (p less than 0.001), and the shortest preexcited RR interval decreased from 302 +/- 56 to 256 +/- 43 msec (p less than 0.01). In another seven patients, propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) was administered before atropine, and atropine lengthened the anterograde block cycle length and the effective refractory period of the accessory AV connection; the magnitude of these effects was similar to that in the patients who did not receive propranolol. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that resting vagal tone exerts a direct depressant effect on accessory AV connections that does not require background sympathetic activity to be manifest.", 
    "15": "1. The effects of single oral doses of propranolol (80 mg), or atenolol (100 mg) on resting heart rate, blood pressure, forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance and on responses to central hypovolaemia, were compared with those of placebo in nine healthy European and nine healthy Bengalee volunteers, in a double-blind, three-period, cross-over study. 2. Atenolol induced a significant reduction in resting systolic blood pressure (SBP) in Europeans but not in Bengalees, although the bradycardic effects of atenolol were similar in both groups. Atenolol did not have any significant effect on forearm blood flow (FBF) or forearm vascular resistance (FVR) in either group. In the presence of propranolol (80 mg) there were no statistically significant falls in BP but there were significant bradycardias, falls in FBF and rises in FVR that were similar in Europeans and Bengalees. 3. In the presence of placebo Europeans exhibited significant falls in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during lower body negative pressure (LBNP) of 20 and 30 mm Hg. Bengalees did not show falls in DBP during LBNP. However, there were no significant differences between DBP responses in Europeans and Bengalee subjects. Both Bengalees and European subjects showed similar reductions in FBF and FVR during LBNP of 30 mm Hg. 4. In the presence of propranolol, significant changes in forearm blood flow and forearm vascular resistance were evident in Bengalee subjects during LBNP of 20 mm Hg and 30 mm Hg, whereas in the Europeans significant changes in those variables did not occur at any level. The changes in FBF and FVR during LBNP of 20 and 30 mm Hg in Bengalee and European subjects were significantly different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "1. The oral kinetics of oxazepam after a single 15 mg oral dose was investigated in six healthy volunteers before and during concomitant administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (80 mg) and labetalol (200 mg) (racemates). 2. A possible pharmacodynamic interaction between oxazepam and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was examined using a simple reaction time test (SRT) and by measurement of postural sway. 3. The kinetics of oxazepam were not affected significantly by propranolol or labetalol, although oxazepam and labetalol share the glucuronidation pathway. 4. The SRT was increased by combination of both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with oxazepam, with the greatest increase after the coadministration of oxazepam with propranolol. Administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists alone had no significant effect. 5. Postural sway was affected significantly only by the combination of oxazepam and propranolol.", 
    "17": "The study was aimed at defining the relationships among the oxidative capacities for three prototype drugs, metoprolol, debrisoquine and sparteine, used for assessing genetically determined polymorphism of drug oxidation in a Japanese population. Among 292 unrelated healthy Japanese subjects who had been defined as extensive (EMs, n = 291) or poor (PM, n = 1) metabolisers of metoprolol oxidation, 55 subjects (EMs = 54 and PM = 1) were selected. One PM of metoprolol oxidation was also identified as a PM not only of debrisoquine but also of sparteine, and no misclassification by the three phenotypic methods was observed. All three correlations among the metabolic ratios of the three test probes assessed by Spearman's rank test were highly significant (P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that in Japanese subjects the oxidation capacities of metoprolol, debrisoquine, and sparteine are closely related. It appears that in Japanese the polymorphic oxidation of the three drugs is co-regulated, either by the same enzyme or gene-controlling system.", 
    "18": "Blood pressure and serum lipoprotein concentrations were assessed in 40 men with essential hypertension at the end of a long-term, controlled intervention study (HAPPHY) after 5.2 +/- 1.4 years of treatment with hydrochlorothiazide (n = 23) or atenolol (n = 17) and after a wash-out period. After withdrawal from antihypertensive medication, the blood pressures of patients treated with diuretics or beta blockers rose from 142/93 and 145/91 to 159/106 and 165/104 mm Hg, respectively. At the same time, low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 17 and 12 mg/dl, respectively, in the diuretic and beta blocker groups (p less than 0.05). In addition, total cholesterol decreased by 16 mg/dl (p less than 0.05) in the diuretic group, whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8 mg/dl (p less than 0.01) and triglycerides decreased by 27 mg/dl (p less than 0.05) in the beta blocker group at the end of the wash-out period as compared to the final phase of the HAPPHY study. The data indicate the persistence of lipid changes during long-term treatment with hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol. For the first time, it was clearly demonstrated that the well-known unfavorable effects of diuretics and beta blockers on lipid metabolism are reversible after cessation of long-term therapy of several years' duration.", 
    "19": "To examine the effect of nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerve stimulation on the antigen inhalation with allergic animals, changes in pulmonary resistance (RL) and arterial plasma histamine concentration ([H]) caused by inhalation of Ascaris suum antigen were studied in five control (Group A) and five nerve-stimulated (Group B) cats, which were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated. All animals were actively sensitized with Ascaris antigen before the experiment. After cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade with intravenously administered atropine (3 mg/kg) and propranolol (2 mg/kg), inhalation of the antigen (1:100 dilution) was performed for 3 min. For Group B, bilateral cervical vagi were stimulated electrically for 1 min before the antigen inhalation and successively every 30 s until 5 min had passed from the onset of inhalation. RL and [H] were determined before, during, and after antigen inhalation in both groups. Baseline RL and [H] did not differ significantly between groups (16.3 +/- 2.2 (mean +/- SE) cm H2O/L/s and 14.0 +/- 0.7 ng/ml, respectively, for Group A; 14.4 +/- 1.3 and 15.6 +/- 2.7, respectively, for Group B). Increases in RL and [H] of Group B after the antigen inhalation were significantly depressed, compared with Group A (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively, two-way ANOVA). The increase in RL 5 min after antigen inhalation was 113 +/- 19% for Group A and 28 +/- 8% for Group B, and the increase in [H] at the same point was 36.3 +/- 9.1 ng/ml for Group A and 4.4 +/- 1.4 ng/ml for Group B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Resting measurements of left ventricular systolic function do not reliably predict exercise capacity in patients with cardiac disease. Therefore left ventricular filling shortly after a myocardial infarction was prospectively studied to determine whether it could predict subsequent exercise time. Consecutive patients with an acute infarction underwent Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography within 36 hours of infarction. The study group was composed of the 26 men who did not have reperfusion, who had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, and who had undergone symptom-limited stress testing during recovery (modified Bruce protocol, 44 +/- 23 days after myocardial infarction). Systolic function was measured by ejection fraction and a wall motion score. Ventricular filling was assessed by the peak transmitral Doppler velocity in early diastole (E), with atrial systole (A), their ratio (A/E), and the percentage of filling from atrial systole. The only parameter of systolic or diastolic function that correlated with exercise time was E (r = 0.65, p less than 0.001). This relationship was particularly strong for the 16 subjects taking beta blockers at the time of stress testing (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001). Stepwise multivariate regression analysis showed that only E and beta blocker therapy at the time of stress testing contributed to the model predicting recovery exercise time (R2 = 0.55). In summary, E, measured soon after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction, is one factor that predicts exercise capacity during recovery.", 
    "21": "We used spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) to study the effects of the calcium channel blockers diltiazem and nifedipine and the beta-blocker metoprolol on the sympathetic nervous system in patients following myocardial infarction. Energy in the low-frequency range (0.04 to 0.12 Hz) in the standing (tilt) position was used as a quantitative index of sympathetic activity. Twenty-seven male patients, mean age 62 +/- 13 years, were studied 2 to 6 weeks after myocardial infarction. Eight patients received metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily; nine patients received diltiazem, 60 mg three times daily; and 10 patients received nifedipine, 10 mg three times daily. HRV and arterial blood pressure were recorded before and 5 to 7 days after initiation of therapy. None of the drugs had significant effects on the systolic blood pressure, and only nifedipine significantly reduced the diastolic blood pressure. Metoprolol and diltiazem reduced the low-frequency HRV in all patients studied, but nifedipine had no consistent effects. Our results suggest that diltiazem had a depressant effect on sympathetic activity similar to beta-adrenergic blockers. This effect was not observed with nifedipine. The reduction in sympathetic activity by diltiazem may contribute to its therapeutic effects in the post-infarction period.", 
    "22": "Doses of d-amphetamine (3.2 mg/kg), fenfluramine (10 mg/kg) and quipazine (8 mg/kg) cause a significant reduction in food intake during a 30-min daily feeding session in food-deprived rats. Pirenperone and ritanserin, 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, significantly blocked the anorectic effect of quipazine, while d-amphetamine and fenfluramine effects were not modified. Metergoline, a non-specific blocker of 5-HT receptors, significantly blocked the anorectic effects of fenfluramine and quipazine, but not the d-amphetamine effect. Pretreatment with alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (prazosin, propranolol and pindolol), dopamine receptor antagonists (haloperidol and pimozide), the catecholamine synthesis inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine, and the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone failed to modify the anorectic effects of all three agents, with the exception that quipazine-induced anorexia was significantly reduced by pimozide. These results suggest that the quipazine anorexia is largely mediating through 5-HT2 receptors, although the effect of pimozide remains to be explained. Consistent with previous studies, the fenfluramine effect appears to be mediated through 5-HT1B receptors. Receptors involved in the anorectic effect of higher doses of d-amphetamine are still unidentified by this analysis. Further investigation is required to define the mechanisms by which quipazine and larger doses of d-amphetamine bring about a reduced appetite for food.", 
    "23": "About 20 cases of beta blocker-associated pneumonitis have been published in the mid-70s, and a case of interstitial pneumonitis has been attributed to propranolol. The pathogenesis of these cases of pneumonitis with or without pleural effusion is not clear. A 59-year-old man developed pneumonitis which showed all the characteristics of a drug-associated pneumonitis due to propranolol: BAL demonstrated a lymphocytosis, the variations of which closely correlated with a provocation test. The LIF appeared to be released by the patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes when cultured with optimal doses of propranolol. Production of LIF by the patients' lymphocytes suggests the existence of a drug-specific cellular immune response in propranolol-associated pneumonitis.", 
    "24": "Silent ischemia is a common finding in coronary artery disease and occurs more frequently than painful episodes in the total ischemic burden. Since painless ischemia places limits on the history, it can encourage physicians to spend more time studying and treating the electrocardiogram and less time with patients, potentially leading to a deterioration in doctor-patient relationship and care. Silent ischemia should be considered only in patients 35 years of age or older who: (a) have a strong family history of early coronary artery disease, or (b) have two major coronary risk factors. Verification is made by performing an electrocardiographic exercise stress test and followed by a thallium-201 electrocardiographic stress test when the electrocardiograms are equivocal. In females it is best to proceed directly to a thallium-201 electrocardiographic stress test because of the frequency of false positives on the exercise electrocardiograms. The results will help determine the indications for further studies and subsequently the need for drug or interventional management. Frequently a history in which symptoms of lower esophageal disorders, hiatal hernia, gastric disease and arthritic pains mimic angina or in fact coexist with ischemic heart disease makes the clinical diagnosis of angina more elusive and difficult. However, a careful unhurried history and an exercise stress test can often differentiate the etiology of the chest pains. A 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording aids in measuring the total ischemic burden. When the diagnosis and severity of the ischemic syndrome is established, a course of medical therapy tailored to the symptoms and with defined end points is initiated. Since silent ischemia and angina frequently coexist, suppression of the frequency and severity of the anginal episodes will also reduce the episodes of silent ischemia. Symptomatic improvement is thus a guide in the treatment of the total ischemic syndrome. Drug management will usually consist of two or more of the following drugs: a nitrate, beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, and aspirin. A 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recording is helpful in assessing the efficacy of medical management of silent ischemia. Failures in drug management should proceed with coronary angiography, and when indicated, followed by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.", 
    "25": "Phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) N-methyltransferase activities were studied in rat heart sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticular fractions after a single intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol (0.5-5.0 mg/kg). Three active sites (I, II, and III) for PtdEtn N-methylation were assayed by measurement of [3H]methyl group incorporation from 0.055, 10, and 150 microM S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine into membrane PtdEtn molecules. Total methylation activity for catalytic site I of both sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum was stimulated within 2 minutes by isoproterenol in a dose-dependent manner. Although the increased methyltransferase activity in sarcoplasmic reticulum was normalized at 10 minutes, the enzyme activity in sarcolemma was normalized at 5 minutes but was again increased at 10-30 minutes after isoproterenol injection. No changes in response to isoproterenol were seen for site II and III N-methylation activities in either membrane. Individual N-methylated phospholipids (phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine, phosphatidyl-N,N-dimethylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine), which specifically formed at each site, showed similar behavior. Pretreatment of the animals with a beta-blocking drug, atenolol, for 2 days prevented the isoproterenol-induced changes in hemodynamic parameters and sarcolemmal methylation without affecting the enhanced methylation activities in sarcoplasmic reticulum. In vitro addition of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (catalytic subunit) plus Mg-ATP enhanced methyltransferase activities in sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum from control hearts by 2.7- and 2.3-fold, respectively; however, under the same in vitro conditions, only about 20% activation was seen in both subcellular membranes isolated from the heart of isoproterenol-injected animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been performed clinically to provide a substitute for myocardium, to assist dyskinetic ventricles, and to benefit patients with Chagas disease or dilated cardiomyopathy. Encouraging results have been observed for the patients; however, a conclusive experimental study is not available. How to use conditioned skeletal muscle for maximal augmentation of cardiac function in an appropriate animal model is the goal of this study. Dogs were used for heart failure induction, for single versus burst muscle stimulation, and for cardiac function augmentation. Muscle transformation was documented by histochemical evaluations. Propranolol infusion (3 mg/kg) induced temporary heart failure for 4 to 6 hours with significantly decreased cardiac output and blood pressure. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty significantly improved hemodynamic function during induced heart failure with better improvement by multiple (burst) stimulation as compared with single stimulation. Skeletal muscle fiber orientation is a critical factor for the success of this procedure. Our results indicated that skeletal muscle fiber oriented circumferential to the heart and perpendicular to the ventricular septum is the preferred procedure for dynamic cardiomyoplasty.", 
    "27": "The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of catecholamines on skin necrosis independent of their vasoactive effects. Rat abdominal or human breast skin was excised, pinned flat, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 6 hours in a buffered salt solution containing catecholamine. At 0.1 and 6 hours the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from the skin and appearing in the buffer was determined spectrophotometrically. All groups showed similar LDH levels at 0.1 hour. Rat skin treated with greater than or equal to 10(-7) M epinephrine (33 times less than the 1:200,000 used clinically) or greater than or equal to 10(-5) M norepinephrine showed a significant increase in the LDH released at 6 hours versus controls (18.75 +/- 1.25 versus 13.75 +/- 1.25 and 29.25 +/- 2.96 versus 22.00 +/- 1.96 IV, respectively). Total tissue LDH levels were not significantly different at 0.1 or 6 hours. The toxic effect of epinephrine was eliminated by the addition of propranolol or selective beta 2 blockade, but not by alpha or beta 1 blockade. Therefore, this effect appears to be mediated largely by beta 2 receptors. Similar toxic effects were seen in human breast skin treated with 1:200,000 epinephrine and were blocked with propranolol. Phenylephrine at 1:20,000 demonstrated toxicity, but angiotensin II and vasopressin did not. These studies indicate that addition of catecholamine to ischemic rat or human skin accelerates skin death within 6 hours, but that the toxicity can be reversed with beta blockade.", 
    "28": "We studied whether an optimal Emax (contractility index) to minimize myocardial O2 consumption (MVo2) for a constant external work (EW) and, hence, maximize mechanical work efficiency exists as a nadir of MVo2 within the physiological range of Emax. MVo2 and Emax were measured in the left ventricles (LV) of 10 dogs. In each experiment, heart rate, cardiac output, and mean aortic pressure were kept constant by pacing, bypassing the right heart, and adjusting the inflation of an intra-aortic balloon, respectively, to maintain a constant EW. MVo2 was determined as the product of coronary arteriovenous O2 difference, and coronary blood flow drained from the right heart. Emax was obtained by an abrupt aortic occlusion method. We changed Emax over 1.4-16.1 mmHg.ml-1.100 g) by dobutamine, propranolol, and sodium pentobarbital. The obtained MVo2-Emax relationship showed that MVo2 correlated positively with Emax in 9 of the 10 dogs (correlation coefficients = 0.68-0.96). In one of the 9 dogs and the remaining dog, MVo2 slightly increased with decreases in Emax below 7-8 mmHg.ml-1.100 g. We conclude that the optimal Emax to minimize MVo2 for a constant EW does not generally exist as a nadir of MVo2 in the physiological range of Emax in dog hearts.", 
    "29": "Chronopharmacological investigations were performed in 54 guinea pigs and 126 white mice to explore their tolerance to arrhythmogenic and lethal doses of strophanthin, and changes in sensitivity to threshold antiarrhythmic dose of inderal during 24 hours. The investigations were carried out at a 4-hour interval, i.e., six times in 24 hours. The data obtained were processed using the approximation method to determine sinusoid fluctuations with an initially given period (cosinor analysis) and with an unknown period (non-linear least-square method in combination with the method of gradual approximation) on an EC 1045 computer and a DZ 28 microcomputer. It was found that strophanthin toxicity in guinea pigs and white mice reaches a maximum in the late evening, night and early morning hours. The acrophases of circadian rhythms of chronotolerance to the threshold arrhythmogenic dose of strophanthin, and those of chronosensibility to inderal are virtually identical.", 
    "30": "A method is described to determine metoprolol in plasma by GC-ECD. Metoprolol and alprenolol (internal standard) reacted rapidly with heptafluorobutyric anhydride under the catalysis of tetrahydrofuran (THF) after being extracted from plasma with cyclohexane. The derivatives produced quantitatively were identified by GC-MSD to be diheptafluorobutyl metoprolol and dihepatafluorobutyl alpredolol which were then separated and detected by 3% SE-30 packed glass column (2m x 3 mm) equipped with ECD. The detection limit was 1 ng/ml and the linear range was 10-1500 ng/ml (r = 0.9993). Average recovery from spiked plasma was 97.30%. The coefficient of variation of day-to-day and within-day were less than 8% and 7%, respectively. The method has been applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of metoprolol and also applied to clinical monitoring of metoprolol levels in patients.", 
    "31": "The effect of gastric distension on plasma cholecystokinin (CCK), pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and gastrin concentrations was investigated in healthy volunteers. Fundic and antral distension was achieved by balloons attached to a gastric tube and inflated with 300 and 600 ml and 100 and 200 ml of air for fundic and antral distension, respectively. Gastric juice was continuously aspirated. Fundic distension was additionally studied during a concomitant intravenous infusion of atropine (5 micrograms/kg/h) or a bolus injection of propranolol (2 mg). Fundic distension with 300 ml caused a significant increase in PP release (+17% above basal). Distension with 600 ml significantly stimulated CCK (+81%), gastrin (+31%) and PP output (+74%) over 30 min. Atropine completely blocked PP release and almost abolished CCK release, whereas gastrin output was enhanced. Propranolol did not prevent CCK release induced by fundic distension, whereas gastrin and PP responses were diminished. Antral distension did not cause any significant changes in hormone response. In conclusion, we demonstrated a gastric phase of CCK release which is atropine sensitive, but not influenced by propranolol.", 
    "32": "Three treatment regimens were tried in 145 portal hypertensives with bleeding oesophageal varices to test the efficacy of each regimen in the prevention of rebleeding. Forty-seven cases received oral propranolol, 57 sclerotherapy, while 41 who did not receive any treatment except conservative management served as controls. Patients were followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 and 2 years to see the frequency of bleeding with each regimen. No significant difference was seen at 6 weeks with either of the three regimens but at 6 months and 1 year the frequency of bleeding was significantly less (p less than 0.05) in the propranolol group than in the other two groups while at 2 years results were significantly better with both propranolol (p less than 0.05) and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.001) than in controls. Efficacy of propranolol when compared with sclerotherapy showed similar results. The results of the present study are different from most of the western reports where sclerotherapy was found to be superior to propranolol. Variations in the results are likely to be due to differences in the etiology of portal hypertension in different countries.", 
    "33": "A convenient and rapid procedure for enantiomeric resolution of beta-amino alcohol drugs, such as oxprenolol, propafenone, timolol and phenylephrine, is described. The method is based on derivatization with the chiral reagent 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC), and resolution of the resulting diastereomeric thioureas by reversed-phase HPLC using methanol-aqueous monobasic ammonium phosphate mixture as the mobile phase. The salt forms of these drugs can be directly derivatized with GITC reagent instead of being converted into their free bases and without protection of the phenolic hydroxyl group of phenylephrine.", 
    "34": "1. Doxorubicin dose-dependently increased the cardiac contractility of isolated frog heart within the dose-range of 1.0 to 10.0 x 10(-7) M and dose-dependently increased the cardiac output of frog heart in situ with a dose-range between 10(-7) and 10(-5) M. 2. The results of the in situ investigation, using cardiac output as the index of cardiac contractility, were in agreement with the in vitro results. The positive inotropic effects of doxorubicin climaxed around 10(-5) M beyond which there was a dose-dependent decreased in contractility. 3. Haloperidol (10(-6) M), a dopaminergic receptor blocker, and propranolol (10(-8) M), a beta-adrenergic blocker, did not block the positive inotropic effects of doxorubicin. 4. These results provide sufficient basis to suggest that doxorubicin is acting on the isolated amphibian heart through a mechanism which is not associated with beta-adrenergic and/or dopaminergic receptors.", 
    "35": "The effect of alpha and beta-adrenergic stimulators and blockers on the electroretinogram and visually evoked potentials of the rabbit was studied. It has been observed that subcutaneous administration of noradrenaline, dihydroergotoxine, isoprenaline, propranolol and adrenaline influence the amplitudes of ERG and VEP waves. On the basis of the established results, the role of the adrenergic system in forming the bioelectric response of the retina and visual cortex is discussed.", 
    "36": "The prolactin (PRL) response to challenge with buspirone hydrochloride, a serotonin1a (5-HT1a) receptor agonist, was examined in 5 healthy male volunteers and in 10 healthy male and female patients with primary DSM-III personality disorder. In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with the nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist, metergoline (4 mg p.o.) completely suppressed the maximal PRL response to buspirone challenge. Pretreatment with the nonselective beta-adrenergic/5-HT1-like antagonist, pindolol suppressed the maximal PRL response to buspirone challenge depending upon dose (i.e., between 49 to 90% suppression at best dose). In personality disorder patients, PRL responses to buspirone challenge correlated inversely with self-assessed \"irritability\" (r = -.76, n = 10, p less than .01). These data suggest that the PRL response to buspirone challenge reflects the responsivity of 5-HT1a receptors in the limbic-hypothalamus in humans and that reduced sensitivity of these receptors is associated with an important component of impulsive aggressive behaviors in personality disorder patients.", 
    "37": "We report a controlled 3-week study (n = 30) of adjunctive use of nadolol, 80 to 120 mg per day, vs. placebo for the management of violent psychiatric patients. There were no remarkable adverse cardiac effects at this dose. The active treatment group showed lower total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores after the first week of treatment (analysis of covariance [ANCOVA], p less than .08) and similar trends for the activation factor and the hostility scale. There were parallel findings for measures of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) (Simpson-Angus Neurological Rating Scale), which were reliable after the second week (ANCOVA, p less than .02). A significant association between changes in EPS and BPRS scores was found by regression analysis, after the effects of baseline measures were removed. Given that nadolol does not penetrate the central nervous system well, the antiaggressive effects may be associated with sympathetic nervous system feedback mechanisms.", 
    "38": "A prospective, placebo-controlled, comparative evaluation was conducted on two widely prescribed, sympatholytic antihypertensive agents with known CNS effects. In order to separately assess these effects in younger and older male hypertensives, patients were assigned to either of two treatment studies based on age. For study I, 24 males aged 31-59 (mean = 49.8; SD = 7.4) with mild hypertension (mean DBP = 100.2 mm Hg; SD = 8.0) received 3 months of treatment with propranolol (20-80 mg bid), clonidine (0.1-0.3 mg bid), or double-blind placebo in a counterbalanced, crossover design. For study II, 23 elderly hypertensive males (mean DBP = 102.6 mm Hg; SD = 8.2) aged 60-78 years (mean = 65.1; SD = 4.6) were randomized to propranolol (20-40 mg bid) or double-blind placebo therapy. Patients received cognitive testing, mood assessments, and all-night polysomnographic evaluations before and after each treatment period. Multivariate analysis of EEG sleep data was statistically significant for study I, with significant univariate effects on four of the six primary sleep variables: total sleep time was reduced, sleep maintenance decreased, REM latency increased, and percent total REM time was reduced. A similar MANOVA analysis for the effects of treatment on the sleep of older patients (study II) was not significant. However, propranolol administration was found to be associated with a significant decline in cognitive performance in these patients. Significant mood effects were observed with each of the study drugs, and nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) was significantly decreased in both younger and older patients. Overall, this research suggests that distinct patterns of CNS effects are associated with each of the antihypertensive agents studied.", 
    "39": "We report the case of myasthenia gravis in a 74-year-old woman, 2 weeks after acebutolol had been introduced as the sole treatment for systemic hypertension. The disease developed at a fulminant and fatal course despite drug withdrawal. The possibilities of coincidental association between the two events, triggering of a preexisting latent myasthenia gravis or full induction of the disease by acebutolol, are discussed.", 
    "40": "This paper describes an in vitro method of studying the esophago-irritant potential of oral formulations of drugs. Porcine esophagus was used. The method offers the possibility of studying muscle activity and enzyme leakage (e.g. LDH) and of performing histomorphology of the exposed preparations. Examples of drugs which were tested are alprenolol (Aptin), propranolol (Inderal), doxycycline (Idocyklin) and (Vibramycin) and emepronium bromide (Cetiprin). Concerning effects on muscle activity, Aptic caused a marginal contraction while Cetiprin caused a relaxation of the esophagus preparation. Increased LDH-leakage was noted during exposure with the above mentioned pills in comparison with concurrent control preparations. Histopathological examination disclosed morphological changes such as softening and necrosis of the squamous epithelium of the esophageal mucosa after exposure to drugs like Idocyklin and Aptin.", 
    "41": "In chronic experiments on cats the influence of iontophoretic application of adrenomimetic ephedrin and beta-adrenoblocker obsidan (propranolol) on motor cortex neuron reactions following conditional stimuli was investigated under instrumental placing reaction. It was shown for a majority of neurons that the background impulse activity and reactions following conditional stimulation were suppressed by the influence of ephedrin and on the contrary were increased by obsidan application. It is concluded that there exists a consistent tonic suppressing influence of the noradrenergic system on background and evoked cortical neurons impulse activity in the natural state. It is supposed that noradrenergic influence temporal increase may serve as an important link in mechanisms of external inhibition during stress situations, aversive effects, and distractive external excitations.", 
    "42": "The influence of food intake on the bioavailability of metoprolol from an OROS system has been investigated. No significant difference was found between OROS administration to fasting subjects or after breakfast in any of the kinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, tmax, C24 and lag time). Therefore, metoprolol OROS can be administered with breakfast.", 
    "43": "The effect of acute and long-term treatment with propranolol on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) has been studied in 8 young healthy volunteers. CBF was measured by 133Xe-inhalation and single photon emission computer tomography, and CMRO2 was calculated from the arterio-venous oxygen difference and CBF. Studies were done before and 1 h after i.v. injection of 5 mg propranolol and after three weeks on oral propranolol 80 mg/d for 1 week and 160 mg/d for 2 weeks. Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity in terms of the A-V oxygen difference was tested on all three occasions during hypercapnia and hyperventilation. CBF, CMRO2 and cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity remained stable both after acute and after 3 weeks of treatment with propranolol.", 
    "44": "The effects of varying this frequency were studied in the absence and presence of the specific adrenergic antagonists. There were no appreciable differences in fluid and calcium secretion at different frequencies of stimulation when the nerve was stimulated alone or in the presence of the selective antagonists. Thus, it is difficult to differentiate between the effects of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation by varying the frequency of nerve stimulation. The findings also confirmed that both types of receptors are activated together when the sympathetic nerve is stimulated. beta-Adrenergic receptors play a major role in secretion of both fluid and Ca; alpha-adrenergic receptors seem to have a minor role in their regulation.", 
    "45": "The acute effects on monophasic action potentials (MAP), QT interval, and right ventricle effective refractory period (V-ERP) of propranolol 0.2 mg.kg-1 body weight have been studied in 10 patients with coronary artery disease. The median duration of MAP at 90% repolarization (MAP90) was shortened from 238 to 228 ms at a constant paced heart rate of 100 beats.min-1, while V-ERP remained unchanged. The median ratio V-ERP/MAP90 increased from 1.00 to 1.03. The electrical restitution curves of the duration of premature action potentials, normalized to those paced at constant heart rate, were more horizontal after propranolol. Isometric handgrip shortened MAP90 from 217 to 211 ms and after propranolol similar shortening was found (215 to 209 ms), although both values were slightly lower than before beta-blockade.", 
    "46": "Bopindolol, a new non-selective betablocker, and atenolol, a conventional betablocker, were studied in parallel groups of eight normotensive patients with NYHA II-III angina pectoris. Non-invasive haemodynamic measurements were made using echocardiography and systolic time intervals. Drug doses were 1 mg bopindolol and 100 mg atenolol once daily; measurements were made immediately and at one and six weeks intervals. Both drugs reduced heart rate, atenolol from 62 to 47 beats/minute (24%, P less than 0.01) and bopindolol from 64 to 56 beats/minute (13%, P less than 0.05) at 24 hours. Only atenolol reduced mean blood pressure. Rate pressure product was persistently reduced by atenolol (30% at 24 hours), while with bopindolol this effect lessened with time. Opposite trends in left ventricular enddiastolic and endsystolic diameters were observed; with atenolol tending to increase and bopindolol to lower them. Atenolol had no influence on cardiac contractility, while bopindolol increased it, which was shown by enhancements in the fractional shortening, ejection fraction and maximum velocity of fibre shortening. Neither drug changed peripheral vascular resistance or systolic time intervals. Two patients on bopindolol left the study because of worsening symptoms of coronary artery disease, and two on atenolol owing to side effects, bradycardia and syncope in one and diarrhea in the other. In conclusion, bopindolol showed less beta-blocking effect than atenolol and it had a positive inotropic effect. Its benefit in treating coronary artery disease remains to be proved.", 
    "47": "Male Syrian hamsters were exposed to short photoperiods (10L:14D) for ten weeks and received daily ethanolic saline (1:10), propranolol (125 micrograms, sc) or melatonin (25 micrograms, sc) injections at 16:45. Some hamsters also received melatonin implants (1 mg in 24 mg beeswax, sc) every two weeks in addition to the above treatments. Testicular weights were determined at the beginning, every three weeks, and at the end of the experiment. Serum hormone levels, hypothalamic amine levels and cortical amine levels were also determined at the conclusion of the experiment. Propranolol prevented the decline in testes weight produced by short photoperiod (P less than 0.001 versus control). Propranolol was not able to prevent daily injections of melatonin from producing gonadal regression. Melatonin implants blocked testicular regression produced by both short photoperiod and melatonin injections. No differences in hypothalamic or cortical amine levels were observed between the treatment groups. These results add further support to the suggestion that propranolol is acting at the pineal gland preventing melatonin synthesis and not at a post-pineal central site which would affect melatonin binding and action.", 
    "48": "The immune effects of acebutolol, a beta-blocker, are investigated in various strains of mice. In 6-12 weeks old C57Bl/6 female mice, an increase in the number of immunoglobulin secreting cells is observed only at the age of 9 weeks. At that age, such an effect is seen neither in C57Bl/6 male mice nor in female mice from 6 other strains including OF1 outbred mice. An increase in anti-trinitrophenol plaque forming cells is found in 9 week old C57Bl/6, Balb/c and CBA female mice.", 
    "49": "It is theoretically possible that the vascular effects of topical sympathetic beta-blocking therapy in chronic simple glaucoma (CSG) might tend to neutralise the beneficial effect of a reduced intraocular pressure on the preservation of the visual field. We therefore followed the progress of 422 right eyes and 420 left eyes of 483 patients with CSG and 119 right eyes and 132 left eyes of 151 patients with an original diagnosis of ocular hypertension (OH). These patients were observed for a minimum of one year and up to 13 years, being followed for an average of 5.1 years in the case of CSG and of 4.5 years in OH. The majority of eyes with CSG were treated topically with a miotic and 38% of these received beta blocking therapy in the form of topical timolol. It was concluded that despite suggestions that beta blockers might reduce vascular perfusion of the optic nerve head, which might in turn cause an adverse effect on the visual field progress, the results of this analysis showed that there was less mean deterioration of visual field in eyes treated with beta blocker plus miotic treatment compared with those on miotic therapy alone.", 
    "50": "To characterize the effect of ethanol on the hypothalamic beta-endorphin-containing neurons, rat fetal hypothalamic neurons were maintained in primary culture, and the secretion of beta-endorphin (beta-EP) was determined after ethanol challenges. Constant exposure to ethanol at doses of 6-50 mM produced a dose-dependent increase in basal secretion of beta-EP from these cultured cells. These doses of ethanol did not produce any significant effect on cell viability, DNA or protein content. The stimulated secretion of beta-EP following constant ethanol exposure is short-lasting. However, intermittent ethanol exposures maintained the ethanol stimulatory action on beta-EP secretion for a longer time. The magnitude of the beta-EP response to 50 mM ethanol is similar to that of the beta-EP response to 56 mM of potassium. Ethanol-stimulated beta-EP secretion required extracellular calcium and was blocked by a calcium channel blocker; a sodium channel blocker did not affect ethanol-stimulated secretion. These results suggest that the neuron culture system is a useful model for studying the cellular mechanisms involved in the ethanol-regulated hypothalamic opioid secretion.", 
    "51": "It is well known that the immune function can be compromised by stress. To investigate immune function in mice stressed by experimental restraint or unavoidable and opioid dependent stress, we evaluated the changes in total body weight and in organ weights (liver, spleen and thymus) of these animals, as well as the phagocytic activity of macrophages, the cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibitory effects on tumor growth and changes in T cell subset populations. At the same time we evaluated the effects of Neurotropin (NSP), a substance extracted from the inflamed skin of rabbits inoculated with the vaccinia virus and which appears to possess neuroimmunomodulating activity. The experimentally stressed group exhibited a reduction of phagocytic activity of macrophages, cytotoxicity of T cells and inhibitory effects on tumor growth. In addition there were changes in the population of T cell subsets. In those animals pretreated with NSP, the immunosuppression induced by stress was ameliorated. As compared with several agents which influence phagocytosis, neurotropin exhibited effects similar to that of agents that blocked the adrenaline receptor and an opioid antagonist rather than tranquilizer (diazepam) and a cholinergic receptor blocker. The pharmacologic effects of neurotropin support a relationship between the actions of the central nervous system and the immune system.", 
    "52": "In a limited group of open angle glaucoma patients treated twice daily with timoptol 0.5% and having by this treatment a mean intra-ocular pressure of 21-22 mmHg, the association of timoptol 0.5% with pilocarpine 2% respectively, lowered the intra-ocular pressure to an average of 17.8 mmHg and 16.6 mmHg after one and three weeks of continuous treatment. For this study, the patients have been divided into 3 groups: A group treated with timoptol 0.5% alone throughout the 49 days of the study. A group treated with timoptol 0.5%-pilocarpine 2% (timpilo 2) from day 21 to day 49. A final group treated with timoptol 0.5% until day 21 and then with timoptol 0.5%-pilocarpine 4% (timpilo 4) through out day 49. These patients stopped the treatment before the end of the study. Intra-ocular pressures were measured on days 0, 21 and 49. We found a higher drop of pressure (-4.8 mmHg) in the timpilo 2 group than in the timoptol 0.5% group (-1 mmHg) before instillation as well as 2 hours afterwards (-5.25 mmHg and -2 mmHg respectively). The secondary local effects were due to miotics agents. The secondary systemic effects were those inherent to beta-blockers. These results are comparable with a multicentric study of 220 patients, therefore statistically significant.", 
    "53": "A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was carried out to compare the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of two doses of a fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine slow release (1 capsule or 2 capsules once daily) in 16 hypertensive patients, treated for 4 weeks with each dose. The results suggest that the combination exerted a greater antihypertensive effect at 3 hours compared with 24 to 28-hours post-dose. Demonstrable differences in resting blood pressure between the low and high dose of the combination occurred at the 3-hour but not at the 24 to 28-hour post-dose time point. This apparent difference was also evident under exercise conditions, although no significance between dose differences were demonstrable at either time point. Thus, it appears that any additional benefit in efficacy obtained with the higher dose is not sustained over a 24-hours period. Side-effects were relatively uncommon with the combination, occurring least commonly with the lower dose.", 
    "54": "The observations of a 16-week Tensiomin therapy of 10 hypertensive patients treated with hemodialysis have been discussed. The patients have been treated for about 5 years with hemodialysis, suffered from anuria and required besides systhematical ultrafiltration a combination antihypertensive therapy. Tensiomin was combined with Minipress, Trasicor, Depressan, Estulic and Corinfar by using three- or four-drug combinations. In the course of the administration of Tensiomin the doses of the other antihypertensive drugs could be decreased by 50% on average, while the blood pressure of the patients was normalized. By controlling the patients on weeks 1, 4, 12 and 16 of therapy toxic side-effects or notable pathological changes of the examined laboratory parameters (WBC, serum total protein, Na, K, Ca, P, bilirubin, blood sugar and SGOT values) were not seen. It has been concluded that Tensiomin is an effective drug in combination therapy applied for normalizing the hypertension of dialysed patients.", 
    "55": "The effects of single oral doses of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril (CI-906) 40 mg and the cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker atenolol 100 mg on sympathetic and parasympathetic function and on exercise capacity have been studied in 8 healthy young men. The trial followed a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized cross-over design, with at least one week between treatments. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) at rest were slightly reduced by atenolol but were not affected by quinapril. Atenolol impaired the sympathetically mediated increases in HR and BP caused by standing, immersion of the hand into melting ice, the Valsalva manoeuvre and isometric forearm exercise. Quinapril did not influence those responses nor the vagally mediated bradycardia of the diving reflex. Atenolol, however, augmented the vagal bradycardia, presumably by sympathetic inhibition. In a dynamic bicycle ergometer test with a stepwise increasing work load, exercise performance was decreased by atenolol but not by quinapril. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by quinapril was shown by a marked decrease in serum ACE activity and a several-fold increase in plasma renin activity (PRA). Atenolol produced a moderate reduction in PRA. Before or during exercise, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline were not influenced by either drug. The results indicate that, unlike the atenolol-induced beta-adrenoceptor blockade, ACE inhibition by a single dose of quinapril had no clear effect on autonomic nervous function or exercise capacity.", 
    "56": "Seventy-four patients meeting DSM-III criteria for social phobia completed 4 or more weeks of double-blind, randomized treatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine, the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker atenolol, or placebo. Sixty-four percent of the patients on phenelzine demonstrated moderate or marked improvement, compared to 30 percent on atenolol and 23 percent on placebo. Phenelzine was significantly more effective than atenolol or placebo, whereas the efficacy of atenolol and placebo did not differ significantly. Patients were also prospectively divided into generalized and discrete subtypes of social phobia. Phenelzine appeared to be a particularly effective treatment for the generalized form of social phobia. Atenolol may be useful for discrete forms of social phobia such as performance anxiety.", 
    "57": "It has been found that D-timolol is equipotent or slightly less potent than L-timolol to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) in normotensive rabbits, water loaded ocular hypertensive rabbits, alpha-chymotrypsin induced glaucoma rabbits, hypertonic saline infused IOP recovery model of rabbits, normotensive human volunteers, glaucoma patients and ocular hypertensive human individuals. Although L-timolol has been used widely for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, it produces numerous side effects including cardiovascular disturbances, asthmatic attack, psychological depression, etc. Since D-timolol has much weaker affinity toward beta-adrenergic receptors, it was found to have 1/80-1/300 the beta-adrenergic blocking potency of L-timolol to block beta-adrenergic receptors in guinea pig tracheal preparations and 1/90 of L-timolol to block beta-adrenergic receptors in guinea pig atrial preparations. As a result, D-timolol showed no subjective nor objective side effects on pupil size, conjunctiva, cornea, blood pressure and pulse rate. Further, D-timolol was reported to increase retinal and choroid blood flow in rabbits without affecting overall ocular blood flow. On the contrary, L-timolol was found to significantly reduce the overall ocular blood flow and retinal and choroid blood flows in rabbits, although it might slightly increase the retinal blood flow in normotensive individuals. D-Timolol was well absorbed across the cornea as L-timolol and produced the duration of action as long as L-timolol. These results indicate that D-timolol could be a better agent than L-timolol for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.", 
    "58": "Acute hyperinsulinaemia in the absence of changes in blood glucose increases heart rate in man. Animal studies have suggested that beta-adrenergic blockade does not prevent the insulin-induced increase in heart rate. The aim of the present study was to investigate the acute effect of insulin on heart rate and blood pressure in non diabetic subjects and, in particular, to determine whether beta-adrenergic receptor blockade would significantly influence the effect. On separate days 9 healthy young volunteers were pretreated with either 80 mg propranolol or placebo p.o. After a 60-90 min period of heart rate and blood pressure stabilization, a placebo injection was given intravenously and heart rate and blood pressure were then monitored every 5 min. After 30 min insulin Actrapid MC 0.2 IU/kg body weight was given i.v. A 20% glucose infusion was given to maintain blood glucose at its fasting level. After insulin administration, a rapid and statistically significant increase in heart rate was observed when the patients were pretreated with placebo; pretreatment with propranolol completely prevented this effect. Serum insulin levels were significantly higher than baseline at all times and there was no significant change in blood glucose. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the insulin-induced increase in heart rate in man may result from stimulation of cardiac sympathetic activity.", 
    "59": "The efficacy and tolerability of a once-daily, fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 20 mg nifedipine slow release were evaluated in a 12-month open study of 27 elderly hypertensives who were either newly presenting patients or were those who were inadequately controlled on previous monotherapy or had unacceptable side-effects with their current therapy. After 1-month's therapy with the combination, the mean sitting blood pressure 1 to 4 hours post-dose decreased from 176/103 mmHg to 146/83 mmHg and was maintained at this level for the remainder of the study. Eight patients complained of side-effects on study entry. Sixteen had complaints at some time during the 12 months of fixed combination treatment and 4 were withdrawn because of side-effects. Dizziness occurred in 6 patients on the combination but, as with side-effects overall, tended to resolve with time; its occurrence did not appear to correlate with the on-treatment blood pressure. In this group of elderly hypertension patients, therefore, the combination therapy with atenolol plus nifedipine slow release appeared to exert a greater antihypertensive effect compared with previous therapy, which included atenolol alone, with no evidence of tachyphylaxis and was reasonably well-tolerated over a 12-month period.", 
    "60": "The effects of 6 weeks of treatment with dilevalol 100 mg once daily, or carteolol 10 mg once daily, on renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and total renal vascular resistance (TRR) were studied in 10 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in a randomised cross-over experiment. Both drugs lowered the systolic and diastolic blood pressures to a similar extent without altering the heart rate. Carteolol non-significantly decreased RBF by 9.2% and GFR by 12.3% without altering. TRR, whereas dilevalol produced a significant reduction in TRR by 13.2% (p less than 0.05), a non-significant decrease in RBF by 4.6% and no change in GFR. Neither drug changed plasma osmotic pressure, serum total protein concentration, electrolytes or plasma aldosterone concentration. Plasma renin activity tended to be lower in the dilevalol phase as compared to the carteolol phase. The results suggest that dilevalol may cause a greater decrease in TRR and less reduction in GFR when compared to carteolol in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The difference in the renal effects might be due to the difference in the potency of vasodilatory properties of both drugs at the doses applied.", 
    "61": "0.5% timolol without preservative reduces corneal sensitivity for a shorter period of time than timolol with preservative. The subjective tolerance of unpreserved timolol is much better than that of preserved timolol. The latter and 0.5% levobunolol are significantly more poorly tolerated than buffer solution. The smaller the anesthetic side effects, the better the subjective tolerance of the beta-blockers.", 
    "62": "The kinetic mechanism for the reduction of befunolol catalyzed by befunolol reductase from rabbit liver was investigated. From the initial velocity analysis, product inhibition and coenzyme binding studies, the reduction of befunolol was found to proceed through an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH) binds to the enzyme firstly and NADP+ leaves lastly. NADPH bound to the free enzyme at a molar ratio of 1:1. Furthermore, the result of dead-end inhibition by Cibacron blue F3GA, a nucleotide analogue which binds to many enzymes, was consistent with the ordered Bi Bi mechanism for the enzyme.", 
    "63": "The use of metoprolol combined with nifedipine and diltiazem was studied and compared in 32 patients suffering from coronary disease associated with angina pectoris of effort. The drug combinations indicated appeared equally effective in patients with angina pectoris, functional class III. In patients with angina pectoris of effort, functional classes III-IV, the combined use of metoprolol and diltiazem turned out superior as compared with nifedipine which is related to different hemodynamic effects of the drugs.", 
    "64": "STUDY OBJECTIVE - Catecholamine concentrations are raised during endotoxin shock and may be responsible for myocardial insulin resistance in such a condition. The purpose of the investigation was to examine the effect of insulin on myocardial contractility and glucose uptake in the presence of beta adrenergic blockade during endotoxin shock. DESIGN - Endotoxin shock was obtained in dogs by giving S Typhimurium endotoxin intravenously (1 mg.kg-1) and the cardiac responses to insulin were determined under hyperinsulinaemic (4 U.min-1) euglycaemic clamp conditions during continuous beta adrenergic blockade (propranolol 150 micrograms.kg-1 + 5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). SUBJECTS - 19 mongrel dogs of either sex, weight 20-25 kg, were studied under pentobarbitone anaesthesia. Seven dogs received endotoxin plus propranolol, and seven others received propranolol alone (control group). Five dogs received endotoxin but no propranolol or insulin. All other procedures were the same in each group. MEASUREMENTS and RESULTS - The exposed heart was prepared for coronary sinus blood sampling and measurements of circumflex artery blood flow (Q), instantaneous left ventricular pressure, and left ventricular wall thickness. Glucose uptake was calculated from product of Q and aortic-coronary sinus concentration difference. End systolic pressure-dimension relationship was used to assess contractility. Myocardial performance was assessed from left ventricular dP/dtmax. Basal shock measurements were made 60 min post endotoxin. beta Adrenergic blockade did not interfere with insulin stimulated glucose uptake in controls, but was unable to restore the uptake response during endotoxin shock. Contractility was increased during endotoxin shock and this effect was abolished by beta adrenergic blockade. In controls the only variable affected by beta adrenergic blockade was left ventricular dP/dtmax (decreased). Insulin increased contractility during beta adrenergic blockade in controls but not in shock. Myocardial performance was depressed during shock. In controls, insulin increased myocardial performance; in shock this response was attenuated. CONCLUSIONS - The findings confirm that the myocardium becomes less responsive to the glucose uptake stimulating and positive inotropic effects of insulin during endotoxin shock. The data show that beta adrenergic activity is responsible for the increased contractile state of the heart during acute endotoxin shock, but is not the cause of the observed insulin resistant state.", 
    "65": "Hypertension and serum cholesterol levels are strongly interrelated as cardiovascular risk factors. The Framingham study showed that the risk of both ischaemic heart disease and brain infarction doubles in presence of mild hypertensive status and triplicates in presence of a definitive hypertension. The systolic pressure showed to be the best predictor of both ischaemic heart disease and cerebral infarction particularly in persons aged more than 65 years. In terms of physiopathology we point out several mechanisms by which hypertension could interact with hypercholesterolemia on the arterial wall causing endothelial lesion, enhancing the penetration of arterial wall by lipoproteins, calcium accumulation on smooth subendothelial muscle and suppression of the relaxation factor produced by endothelial cells. In relation to the dietetic treatment, we must restrict more rigorously the ingestion of salt, saturated fatty acids, and total calories. In terms of anti-hypertensive drugs, we should: Avoid thiazide diuretics in case of cholesterol levels of moderate to high risk. Avoid beta blockers in patients with high levels of triglycerides, low HDL and low ratio total cholesterol/HDL. Consider to choose a calcium antagonist, a converting enzyme or an alpha blocker.", 
    "66": "The awareness of the digoxin-quinidine interaction in the mid-70s led to increased interest in drug interactions. Much has been published on the subject in the form of interaction reports, handbooks, lists, cards, discs etc. However, only a few interactions in the literature have clinical significance and can be remembered by thinking in terms of groups, pharmacokinetics and probabilities. It is important to realise that drugs in a given class will have similar properties. Thus, phenylbutazone, like any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is likely to potentiate the effects of warfarin. A knowledge of drug pharmacokinetics is also essential; a highly protein-bound drug may displace another when they are administered together. Remembering those drugs which induce liver enzyme formation will prevent their co-administration with drugs which have a critical dose-range. If a general practitioner can remember the few drugs in clinical practice with a narrow therapeutic index, he can consult a handbook before anything else is prescribed. Some interactions will rarely be encountered in daily general practice, i.e. those associated with tuberculosis treatment or anesthetic agents. Other interactions, e.g. the interaction between antihypertensive treatment and over-the-counter medication containing phenylpropanolamine, are more common. While most drug interactions can be avoided by thinking in terms of groups, pharmacokinetics and probabilities, some learning by rote is required, e.g. the potential for heart failure with concomitant beta-blocker and nifedipine therapy. In general, a schematic approach using thinking in terms of groups, pharmacokinetics and probabilities will prevent most clinically significant drug interactions; the rest can be avoided by consulting appropriate handbooks and specialists.", 
    "67": "Pharmacotherapy is often the single most important medical intervention in the care of the elderly. However, there are obvious concerns about the vulnerability of this group to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). A rapidly accumulating literature regarding changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with advancing age suggests a strong pharmacologic basis for such concerns. Yet, the results of epidemiologic studies exploring the relationship between age and ADRs are ambiguous. Interpretation of the results of these studies is limited by inconsistent definitions of outcomes of interest and failure to control for important age-related covariates including the clinical status of the patient and the number of medications that a patient is receiving. Some recent studies have investigated age-related aspects of specific adverse consequences of drug therapy. For example, age, in and of itself, does not appear to be a risk factor for bleeding complications of warfarin therapy. Older patients may actually be at less risk than younger patients to experience depression associated with beta-blocker therapy. Although examination of data from premarketing studies might be considered a promising strategy to explore the relationship between age and ADR risk, the small number of truly elderly subjects included in these studies greatly limits their usefulness. Postmarketing studies utilizing databases containing clinical data for large numbers of older patients may provide the optimal approach for investigating whether old age is an independent risk factor for ADRs.", 
    "68": "Dilevalol is a novel antihypertensive drug that combines nonselective beta blockade with selective beta 2-receptor agonist activity. Its antihypertensive effect is mediated through arterial vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. At rest, dilevalol has little effect on heart rate or cardiac output. The drug is rapidly and completely absorbed but undergoes significant first-pass hepatic extraction. Its elimination half-life of approximately 12 hours allows for once-daily administration. In controlled clinical trials, dilevalol was at least as effective as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and comparable to beta blockers in antihypertensive efficacy. Preliminary data indicate that dilevalol reverses left ventricular hypertrophy in some patients. It does not adversely affect renal function and may have a favorable effect on plasma lipids, especially high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The agent is usually well tolerated and may prove to be a useful addition to our antihypertensive drugs.", 
    "69": "Portal hypertension may be caused by portal venous outflow obstruction, an increased portal venous inflow due to a hyperdynamic circulation or both. Portal venous collaterals usually develop above a threshold portal venous pressure of 10 to 12 mm Hg. Only about one third of patients with esophageal varices eventually bleed. However, the mortality in patients who do bleed is high (around 50%) mostly because patients frequently die prior to hospital admission. Immediate endoscopy for precise location of site of bleeding is essential. Bleeding then may be controlled by drugs which lower portal pressure, balloon-tube tamponade or emergency injection sclerotherapy. Of these therapeutic options sclerotherapy probably has the highest success rate for the acute control of variceal bleeding. It can in addition be combined with the initial endoscopic diagnostic procedure, and repeated injection sclerotherapy can reduce the incidence of recurrent variceal bleeding. Portasystemic shunts, transection and devascularisation operations are nowadays only used in patients in whom repeated sclerotherapy had failed. Beta-blocking agents may be an alternative for long-term management after variceal bleeding, although the results are controversial. The data regarding prophylaxis of first variceal hemorrhage are conflicting. Prophylactic regimens should only be carried out in the form of controlled trials.", 
    "70": "Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) denotes the increase in energy expenditure that occurs in response to food ingestion. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible influence of age, training state and sympatho-adrenal activity on the early phase of DIT in healthy individuals and further to study whether the magnitude of DIT is reduced in human obesity and, if so, to what extent DIT is influenced by weight reduction induced by surgical treatment, i.e. gastric banding or vertical banded gastroplasty. In addition, the effect of an artificial abdominal insulation on the DIT reaction was examined in healthy subjects in order to find out if the spontaneously enhanced thermal insulation of the body in obese individuals may be accompanied by a reduced DIT. The subjects were studied in the basal state and during 2-3 hours after a mixed meal. The energy expenditure was determined by indirect calorimetry. Blood temperature and blood flow in the hepatic vein were measured and splanchnic oxygen uptake and blood-drained heat from the splanchnic region were calculated. The meal was in liquid form, consisting of 17% kJ protein, 28% kJ lipids and 55% kJ carbohydrates, corresponding to either 60% of the individually measured 24-h resting energy expenditure or to 40% of the individually predicted basal metabolic rate. DIT was expressed as the average increase in energy expenditure above the basal level (means +/- SEM). After a 60% meal it was less (21 +/- 3%, P less than 0.01) in 8 elderly (70 +/- 1 years) and 7 middle-aged (51 +/- 3 yrs) individuals (24 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05) than in 10 young (27 +/- 1 yrs) men (29 +/- 2%). Its magnitude was similar (n.s.) in 7 well-trained men with a higher (58 +/- 2 ml/min/kg BW) maximal oxygen uptake (25 +/- 2%) and 7 sedentary individuals with a lower (39 +/- 2 ml/min/kg BW) aerobic capacity (29 +/- 2%). An intravenous pharmacological inhibition of the beta-adrenergic receptor function failed to influence the DIT in 10 men, irrespective of whether the beta-blockade was instituted by a selective-beta-1 antagonist (atenolol) or a non-selective blocker (propranolol). The DIT was 29 +/- 1% with and 29 +/- 2% (n.s.) without a beta-blockade and it was 29% in 2 subjects after 1 week of oral propranolol medication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade on exercise-induced lipid peroxidation in man has been examined by measuring the production of pentane in expired air. For this purpose, five healthy male subjects were subjected to dynamic exercise of graded intensity on a cycle ergometer (10 min at 45%, 5 min at 60% and 75% maximal oxygen uptake 1 h after ingestion of either a placebo or 40-mg propranolol. At rest, mean pentane concentration [( pent]) with placebo was 4.13 pmol.l-1, SD 2.14. After exercise, this value significantly increased by 310% (17.1 pmol.l-1, SD 7.73, P less than 0.01). Oral administration of 40-mg propranolol significantly lowered the mean resting [pent] to 1.75 pmol.l-1, SD 0.77, P less than 0.05. After exercise, the increase of [pent] was much smaller (240%) and was less significant (P less than 0.2) than with the placebo. The mechanism of this inhibitory effect of propranolol remains to be elucidated. However, as indicated by the measurement of plasma myeloperoxidase concentration, it can be concluded that the antioxidant property of propranolol cannot be attributed to the inhibition of neutrophil activation, a possible source of free radicals during exercise.", 
    "72": "Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to study beta-adrenergic and benzodiazepine receptor density in discrete regions from sagittal brain sections of 20 week old hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (WKY) rats. The density of beta-adrenoceptors was increased by 68% in the granule cell layer of the cerebellum of the SHR without a change in receptor affinity; this increase was specific for receptors of the beta 2-subtype. On the other hand, benzodiazepine receptor density was unchanged in the cerebella of SHR. These results indicate that brain beta-adrenoceptors are differentially modulated by the hypertensive state which may be either a cause or a consequence of alterations in adrenergic nervous system activity found in the SHR.", 
    "73": "To study the relation between plasma adrenaline (AD) and noradrenaline (NA) and the beta 2-adrenoceptor number (Bmax) on lymphocytes these variables were measured in the following three groups: a) In 67 normotensive volunteers after a rest period of at least 15 min. b) In 10 essential hypertensive (HT) and 10 age and sex matched normotensive (NT) subjects before and after a standardized bicycle exercise test (BE). c) In 10 bilaterally adrenalectomized females (AF) and 10 healthy age matched females (NF) before and after a mental arithmetic test (MA). Significant correlations were found between AD and Bmax in NT (r = 0.30, P = 0.015) and between the proportional increase in AD and the proportional increase in Bmax after BE (r = 0.60, P less than 0.005). The MA induced elevation of Bmax was blunted after adrenalectomy. All these findings point to a relation between AD and beta 2-adrenoceptor regulation.", 
    "74": "The effect of isotonic bicycle exercise on beta 2-adrenoceptors and cAMP production in lymphocytes was studied. The origin of the newly exposed receptors was studied by measuring radioligand binding in the presence of hydrophylic or lipophylic 'cold' ligands. During exercise beta 2-adrenoceptor density increased from 1207 +/- 144 to 1776 +/- 152 sites/cell (56 +/- 14%). Isoprenaline induced an increase in cAMP synthesis, which was 68 +/- 15% higher than those values measured before the test. Forskolin did not induce a higher increase in cAMP production after exercise. The increase in receptor density seems not to be due to a transfer of internalized receptors to the membrane surface. We conclude that physical exercise induces an up-regulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes and that these adrenoceptors are functional.", 
    "75": "We have tested the effects of carteolol and 8-hydroxycarteolol on cAMP generation in S49 lymphoma and BC3H1 smooth muscle-like cells. Carteolol was a high affinity beta-adrenoceptor antagonist in both systems but did not stimulate cAMP accumulation. The metabolite 8-hydroxycarteolol also was a high affinity antagonist. In contrast to its parent compound, however, it possessed an agonistic component which was considerably stronger than that of other beta-adrenoceptor blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, e.g. dichloroisoprenaline, pindolol, or celiprolol. These results suggest that metabolites can possess different pharmacodynamic properties in terms of beta-adrenoceptor interaction relative to parent compounds.", 
    "76": "To determine the degree to which increased sympathetic activity contributes to the increase in renin secretion produced by a low sodium diet, the beta-adrenergic blocking drug propranolol or saline vehicle was injected through indwelling jugular cannulas in rats fed a normal diet and rats fed a low sodium diet for 9 days. Plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma renin concentration (PRC) were elevated by the low sodium diet, and these values were reduced 42-45% by propranolol, although they were still higher than in the normal diet controls. Plasma corticosterone was moderately elevated in cannulated rats on regular diet, compared to decapitated controls, but corticosterone did not differ between cannulated and decapitated rats on low salt diet; propranolol reduced plasma corticosterone. However, PRA and PRC were comparable in cannulated rats and decapitated controls on both the normal and the low sodium diets, and propranolol did not produce a significant reduction in PRA and PRC in rats fed the normal diet. This indicates that the effects of propranolol on PRA and PRC in the low sodium rats were not simply due to reduction of a stress-induced increase in renin secretion. The results indicate that increased sympathetic activity makes a substantial contribution to the increase in renin secretion produced by 9 days of dietary sodium restriction.", 
    "77": "Gestational exposure to nicotine has been shown to affect development of noradrenergic activity in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the current study, pregnant rats received nicotine infusions of 6 mg/kg/day throughout gestation, administered by osmotic minipump implants. After birth, offspring of the nicotine-infused dams exhibited marked increases in basal adenylate cyclase activity in membranes prepared from kidney and heart, as well as supersensitivity to stimulation by either a beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, or by forskolin. The altered responses were not accompanied by up-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors: in fact, [125I]pindolol binding was significantly decreased in the nicotine group. These results indicate that fetal nicotine exposure affects enzymes involved in membrane receptor signal transduction, leading to altered responsiveness independently of changes at the receptor level.", 
    "78": "The effects of a single administration (48 hours) and of chronic (14 days) treatment with tricyclic (desipramine, nortryptiline) and nontricyclic (mianserin, nomifensine) antidepressant drugs on responses of the isolated anococcygeus muscle to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist xylazine (inhibition of contraction to field stimulation at 1 Hz) and to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (contraction of the muscle) have been studied. Of the drugs used only desipramine and nortryptiline administered chronically reduced the responsiveness of the anococcygeus muscle to phenylephrine suggesting a desensitization of postsynaptic alpha 1-adrenoceptors. Long-term but not acute administration of antidepressants resulted in significant decrease in sensitivity of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors to xylazine. These results show that the adaptative changes of alpha-adrenoceptors in the rat anococcygeus muscle following long-term administration may depend on the efficiency to inhibit the neuronal uptake and the ability to antagonize alpha 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "79": "The adrenergic receptor binding capacities in human fetal and adult livers were measured to investigate the mechanism of the reduced alpha-1 adrenoreceptor response of the liver associated with a reciprocal increase in beta-adrenoreceptor activity in a number of conditions. Alpha-1 and beta-adrenoreceptor density were determined using 3H-prazosin and 3H-dihydroalprenolol, respectively, as radioligand. Heterogenous populations of beta-adrenoreceptors were found in fetal liver contrast to adult. Decreased alpha-1 and increased beta-receptor density were found which may relate to a decreased level in cellular differentiation. These findings may be important for the investigation of perinatal hypoglycaemia of newborns after treatment of premature labour with beta-mimetics. This is the first demonstration of differences in the ratio of alpha-1 and beta-adrenoceptors in human fetal liver.", 
    "80": "Clonidine, noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of propranolol), but not phenylephrine and methoxamine, stimulated an increase in the oxygen consumption of these slices that was blocked by yohimbine but not by prazosin. The stimulation was inhibited by ouabain and required the presence of Ca2+ in the incubation medium. The calcium ionophore A 23187 stimulated oxygen consumption in the tissue slices and enhanced the respiratory effect of clonidine. Atropine and (D-Pro2, D-Trp7.9)-substance P failed to block the respiratory response to clonidine in concentrations that inhibited the respiratory effects of carbachol and substance P, respectively. Release of acetylcholine from the unstimulated gland slices was reduced by clonidine or Ca2+ omission. Yohimbine prevented the clonidine effect and stimulated acetylcholine resting release. Nifedipine did not affect either the release of acetylcholine or the clonidine-induced reduction of acetylcholine release but blocked the oxygen uptake due to clonidine or to release acetylcholine.", 
    "81": "The authors studied the effect of administration of thyroid hormones on the beta-adrenergic receptors of rat adenohypophyseal cells. The administration of triiodothyronine and thyroxine was followed by an increase in specific binding for 3H-dihydroalprenolol. No significant differences were found in cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels before and after isoprenaline stimulation. The significance of changes in these receptors for the hyperplastic reaction after oestrogens is discussed with reference to the inhibitory effect of the thyroid hormones on hyperplasia of the adenohypophyseal cells after the administration of oestradiol.", 
    "82": "Using a sensitive potentiometric method the effect of isoproterenol upon the activity of Na, K-ATPase in cardiomyocytes has been studied. The activity of the enzyme in rat sarcolemma at isoproterenol-induced myocarditis decreases by 42%. A direct action of isoproterenol on the Na, K-ATPase activity in sarcolemma in vitro has been investigated. In the concentration range 10(-9)-10(-3) M (from receptor-binding up to cardiotoxic) a gradual decrease of the activity reaching the complete inhibition at 10(-3) M is revealed. Antagonist of beta-adrenoreceptors propranolol in concentrations required for displacing the agonist (10(-9) M) provides for the recovery of the Na, K-ATPase activity up to 76% of its normal activity. This action transforms into nonspecific inhibition at rising concentration of the antagonist. Possible mechanisms of the beta-adrenergic regulation effect in cardiomyocytes on Na, K-ATPase of the sarcolemma are discussed.", 
    "83": "Peculiarities of spike responses of the sensorimotor cortex neurons and conditional activity induced by blockade of noradrenergic and serotoninergic inputs of the PF complex (CM-PF) have been studied in chronic experiments on cats with a preliminarily conditioned placing reaction to an auditory stimulus--a click. It is shown that an increase in the background activity of neurons of the sensorimotor cortex was caused by microinjections of obsidan, an adrenergic blocker, while depression--by microinjections of lysergoamid, a serotonin blocker. The effect of both blockers on the neuronal reactions evoked by conditional auditory stimulus was the same (depression). Both conditional placing and unconditional one were removed by partial blockade of monoaminergic inputs for 30-60 min. A conclusion is made that the character of the influence of the monoaminergic system on the sensorimotor cortex is determined not only by direct, but also by indirect influences due to neurons of the CM-PF complex of thalamic nuclei.", 
    "84": "Beta adrenergic binding sites were localized and characterized in the human eye by means of \"in vitro\" autoradiography, using [125I] (-) iodocyanopindolol (125ICYP) as radioligand. Binding sites were visualized by apposition of isotope sensitive film to slide mounted eye sections. Receptor sites were present in the extraocular muscles, in the conjunctiva, in the epithelium and endothelium of the cornea, in the trabeculum and in the ciliary muscle. They were also present in the lens epithelium and in the retina. The pigmented ocular structures were heavily labelled but the binding was nonspecific. Characterization of these binding sites was achieved by testing the ability of selective adrenergic compounds to displace 125ICYP binding. These studies suggested that the majority of adrenergic binding sites in nonpigmented structures of human eye were of a beta2 type.", 
    "85": "The short-term effects of the intraperitoneal administration of dl-propranolol on the wake-sleep cycle of the rat were studied in relation to the cyclic AMP concentration in the preoptic region and cerebral cortex. The results show that propranolol, but not saline, affected all stages of the wake-sleep cycle, increasing wakefulness, decreasing synchronized sleep and abolishing desynchronized sleep. These effects were associated with a decrement in cyclic AMP concentration both in wakefulness and synchronized sleep. However, this decrement was relatively larger in the preoptic region than in the cerebral cortex. The effects of the drug on cyclic AMP accumulation were also studied in hypoxia, a condition of unspecific brain stimulation. In this condition, the cyclic AMP concentration in both brain regions was found to be higher than that observed during either wakefulness or synchronized sleep. In the hypoxic condition propranolol was found to decrease the nucleotide concentration to the same levels observed in wakefulness and synchronized sleep following its administration. However, no difference in the relative magnitude of the decrement was found between the preoptic region and the cerebral cortex. These findings suggest that in both brain regions the drug acts on a cyclic AMP accumulating system, which may be defined as propranolol-sensitive. The activity of the propranolol-sensitive system in the preoptic region would appear to be related to wake-sleep processes.", 
    "86": "Labetalol is a relatively new and unique hypotensive agent that has both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blocking properties. 12 patients in fit physical condition who underwent elective oral surgery were subject to hypotensive anesthesia with labetalol to assess the hemodynamic aspects and clinical effects of the drug. All of them had their anesthesia maintained with halothane and N2O in 50% O2 supplemented by fentanyl and vecuronium. Initiation of deliberate hypotension was made with intravenous bolus of labetalol at 0.5 mg/kg and the ideal level of mean arterial pressure at 55 +/- 5 mm Hg was maintained with adjustment of the concentration of halothane. At the termination of deliberate hypotension, the blood pressure was recuperated to the baseline level by lowering the concentration of halothane and administration of 0.5-0.6 mg intravenous atropine. Our results showed that the total dose of labetalol used was 44 +/- 13 mg and blood loss amounted to 354 +/- 136 ml. Important changes of hemodynamic parameters before and after labetalol included the fall of mean BP, HR, mean PAP, CI, LVSWI, SVRI, PVRI and O2 delivery and the increasing of O2 extraction. As to CVP, PCWP, SVI, O2 consumption and shunting the alterations were minimal. Blood gas analysis showed that, save a slight fall of pH indicating mild metabolic acidosis, the PaO2 and PaCO2 remained unchanged following the use of labetalol. Labetalol-induced hypotension could be effectively reversed by using of atropine as shown in our study and all the patients recovered uneventfully from hypotensive anesthesia. They were entirely free from any complication or sequela relevant to the deliberate hypotension after one year's follow-up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the roles of protein kinase A and/or C in agonist-induced beta adrenoceptor activation in intact human lymphocytes. LYmphocytes from healthy subjects were incubated with isoproterenol and phosphodiesterase inhibitor (IBMX, 1.0 mM) after 20 minutes of preincubation with (or without) various compounds possessing protein kinase A and/or C inhibitory activities. These compounds included the relatively selective protein kinase C (PK-C) inhibitors (W-7, calmidazolium, polymyxin B, neomycin, tamoxifen and clomiphene), purified protein inhibitors of protein kinase A (PK-A) (obtained synthetically, or purified from bovine hearts and porcine hearts) and the two compounds (H-7, H-9), which have been found to inhibit both PK-A and PK-C. The results showed that all PK-C inhibitors alone decreased cellular basal cAMP levels while inhibitors of PK-A as well as both H-7 and H-9 increased basal cAMP levels in a dose dependent manner at certain concentrations. All inhibitors studied potentiated isoproterenol-induced cAMP accumulation. The protein kinase A and C inhibitor, H-7, also potentiated PGE1 (but not forskolin)-induced cAMP accumulation. In contrast, the protein kinase C activator, PMA, inhibited isoproterenol- and PGE1- (but not forskolin) induced cAMP accumulation. These data suggest that the potentiating effects of PK-A and/or C inhibitors may be related to the inhibition of PK-A and/or PK-C, both of which have been shown to be involved in beta 2 adrenoceptor desensitization and phosphorylation.", 
    "88": "Using L-[3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA), a potent beta-adrenergic antagonist, we demonstrated in breast cancer cells the presence of beta-adrenergic receptors with high affinity (Kd 1-9 nM) as shown by Scatchard analyses. Natural and synthetic agonists inhibited the [3H]DHA binding in the following order of potency: L-isoproterenol = L epinephrine much much greater L-norepinephrine, identical to the well-established order of potency for these compounds in producing beta-adrenergic responses. We verified that these compounds actually stimulated cAMP production in breast cancer cells. At the present time, the pathophysiological significance of beta-adrenergic receptors remains unclear. In view of the importance of cAMP in lactose production and in tumor growth mechanisms, it seems to be important to characterize the beta-adrenergic receptors in breast cancer cells in more detail and study their possible involvement in breast tumor growth.", 
    "89": "1. There are few studies which both describe the in vitro regulation of glycogen metabolism in nonmammalian animals and list methods to optimize assay conditions for these studies. 2. A mechanical tissue chopper was used to obtain 25-65 mg liver explants from 14- to 28-day old domestic turkeys to determine assay conditions (substrates, buffers, time), regulators (metals, salts and hormones) and points of endogenous regulation of glycogenolysis (protein phosphorylation and enzyme activity). 3. High- and low-bicarbonate-based buffers (Earle's balanced salts, EBSS and Hanks' balanced salts, HBSS, respectively) were used to determine buffer effects. 4. Glucose release into the incubation environment was greater in HBSS than EBSS. Adding HEPES to further buffer conditions did not change release rates. Adding bicarbonate to HBSS resulted in release rates similar to EBSS. 5. Calcium increased glycogenolysis in the presence of absence of equimolar concentrations of EGTA; potassium had no effect. 6. Porcine insulin (100 ng/ml) did not inhibit glycogenolysis; however, glucose release was increased by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. A noted catecholamine-induced increase in in vitro glycogenolysis and phosphorylase activity indicates that points of regulation are under phosphorylation-dephosphorylation regulation.", 
    "90": "Phenylephrine produced concentration-related positive inotropic responses in isolated left atria and papillary muscles of guinea-pigs and rats. In rat tissues, these responses were unaffected by propranolol but antagonized by prazosin and therefore mediated via alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine also exerted positive inotropic effects in these rat tissues. The maximum alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated effect of methoxamine (relative to the isoprenaline maximum) was greater than that of phenylephrine in left atria (in the presence of propranolol), whereas in papillary muscles phenylephrine exerted the greater maximum. In guinea-pig papillary muscles, the response to phenylephrine was unaffected by prazosin but was antagonized by propranolol and therefore caused by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Methoxamine had no effect in guinea-pig papillary muscles. Guinea-pig left atria produced biphasic concentration-response curves for phenylephrine, the lower portion being antagonized by phentolamine and was therefore alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated, while the upper portion was antagonized by propranolol and therefore beta-adrenoceptor-mediated. Methoxamine exerted a small inotropic response, the maximum of which was similar to that of the first component of the phenylephrine response. Phenylephrine was a partial agonist for the cardiac beta-adrenoceptor. The density of rat ventricular alpha-adrenoceptors was 4 times greater than beta-adrenoceptor density, as measured by [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-dihydroalprenolol binding. This explains why the responses of rat papillary muscles were alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated. In contrast, the density of beta-adrenoceptor binding sites in guinea-pig ventricles was 6 times greater than the alpha-adrenoceptor density. This explains why the phenylephrine responses were beta-adrenoceptor-mediated in guinea-pig papillary muscles. In the left atria of guinea-pigs, which displayed both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses, the densities of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites were similar. Thus, phenylephrine exerts positive inotropic effects through alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors depending upon their relative densities."
