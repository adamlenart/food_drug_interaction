    "0": "In several studies hypertension has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). This may be due to hypertension itself or to the deleterious effects of some antihypertensive agents on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.", 
    "1": "We examined the 3.5-year incidence of diabetes mellitus in relation to hypertension and antihypertensive medication in a population-based study of elderly subjects (n = 805) aged 65-74 years in Kuopio, Finland.", 
    "2": "Of the subjects studied, 60% had hypertension at baseline and 50% of the hypertensive subjects were on drug therapy at baseline. Hypertensive subjects had a significantly higher incidence of NIDDM than non-hypertensive subjects. However, after adjustment for age, body mass index, waist: hip ratio, sex, and fasting glucose and insulin levels, the increased risk of NIDDM in hypertensive subjects was no longer statistically significant. Subjects with high blood pressure (> or = 160/95 mmHg) at the baseline examination who were not taking beta-blockers or diuretic medication had a 1.56-fold increased risk of developing NIDDM, whereas subjects with hypertension who were taking those agents had a 1.88-fold risk of developing NIDDM compared with subjects with normal blood pressure. The risk of developing NIDDM was accompanied by elevated fasting insulin levels. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, waist:hip ratio, and fasting glucose and insulin levels, hypertensive subjects taking diuretics or beta-blockers, or both, still had a 1.56-fold increased risk of developing NIDDM relative to normotensive subjects. Hypertensive subjects taking diuretics or beta-blockers, or both, had a significantly higher incidence of NIDDM than hypertensive subjects not on pharmacological therapy. However, after adjustment for 2-h glucose and insulin concentrations, the incidence of NIDDM did not differ between the hypertensive subjects.", 
    "3": "The data presented suggest that the increased risk of NIDDM in hypertensive subjects taking beta-blockers or diuretics, or both, is explained at least partly by metabolic disturbances related to drug therapy.", 
    "4": "To determine whether alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptors are altered during regression of cardiac hypertrophy produced by antihypertensive agents.", 
    "5": "Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in rats by aortic banding. After 6 weeks banding the rats were treated with an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (enalapril), an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist (bunazosin) or a beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol) for 6 weeks to induce regression. The numbers of alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors, haemodynamics, tissue noradrenaline content and tissue ACE activity were measured.", 
    "6": "Regression of cardiac hypertrophy occurred after treatment of aortic banded rats with a high dose of enalapril, bunazosin or propranolol, and was accompanied by a reduction in systolic blood pressure. The number of alpha 1- or beta-adrenergic receptors was unchanged by propranolol treatment, but the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors was increased in the hearts of rats treated with bunazosin. A low dose of enalapril (3 mg/kg body weight) caused regression of hypertrophy without a concomitant reduction in blood pressure, and decreased the number of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The dissociation constants for alpha 1- and beta-adrenergic receptors were not different among the experimental groups, and the positive derivatives of left ventricular pressure was unaltered in rats treated with a low dose of enalapril but was reduced by the other drugs.", 
    "7": "Of the three drugs tested, only the low dose of enalapril affected adrenergic receptors during regression of cardiac hypertrophy, causing a decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor number without a reduction in blood pressure. This effect may be explained by non-haemodynamic actions of the ACE inhibitor enalapril, probably by modulation of peripheral sympathetic activity.", 
    "8": "Long-term culture of S49 wild-type cells in medium containing a high concentration of fetal calf serum leads to a modified (S49m) cell line with a reduced number of beta-adrenergic receptors (R). These S49m cells with a higher rate of proliferation were unable to respond to the beta-adrenergic agonists isoproterenol (ISO) and epinephrine as analysed by measuring adenylate cyclase (ac) activity on purified membranes of these cells. Additionally, no accumulation of cyclic AMP was obtained on S49m intact cells upon stimulation with beta-agonists. Nevertheless, S49m cells were able to respond significantly to the direct activation of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding (Gs) protein by aluminium tetrafluoride and sodium fluoride, and to the stimulation of another receptor coupled to the ac system through a Gs protein, by prostaglandin E1 (PGE1). When cloning S49m cells, similar results were obtained upon stimulation with ISO and PGE1 and the cloned cells express the same thy 1.2 and class Id molecules as do S49 cells. The study of S49m cells indicates that they are a beta-adrenergic R-deficient variant distinct from the other variants described for S49 cells.", 
    "9": "We evaluated the effect of the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent nadolol on serum levels of free thyroid hormones in 20 untreated patients with Graves' disease, aged between 17 and 57 years (mean +/- SD, 32.9 +/- 10.5). All the patients were treated with 30 mg of nadolol alone once-daily for 2 weeks, and clinical and laboratory parameters before and after the treatment were compared. Systolic blood pressure was depressed significantly (P < 0.001) from 132.7 +/- 11.1 mmHg to 122.8 +/- 10.9 mmHg. The resting pulse rate was also reduced significantly (from 110.3 +/- 9.2/min to 86.0 +/- 13.2/min, P < 0.001). Serum free thyroxine levels were reduced significantly from 7.1 +/- 3.1 ng/dl to 5.7 +/- 3.6 ng/dl (P < 0.05) and serum free triiodothyronine levels were reduced from 21.9 +/- 5.6 pg/ml to 17.2 +/- 6.9 pg/ml (P < 0.01). In the present study, the beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent nadolol was newly found to have a reducing effect on serum free thyroxine, as well as free triiodothyronine concentrations.", 
    "10": "In order to clarify the insulin-release mechanism of beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist, we examined the effect of CL 316,243, a highly specific beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist having a relative potency of beta 1:beta 2:beta 3 = 0:1:100,000, on insulin secretion in perfused mouse pancreas. The application of 0.2 mM and 0.5 mM CL 316,243 produced significant insulin secretion from within 1 min, which lasted until 2 min after its withdrawal. DL-propranolol and ICI 118551 at 0.2 mM partially inhibited the insulin secretion induced by the 0.2 mM CL 316,243, but 0.2 mM metoprolol had no effect on the insulin release produced by 0.2 mM CL 316,243. We conclude that beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulates insulin secretion via beta 3-action in the perfused mouse pancreas.", 
    "11": "Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was undertaken in 25 hypertensives on beta-blocker monotherapy who completed a double-blind crossover trial to compare the effects of fish oil and corn oil supplements on BP. Clinic BP was measured with a Dinamap monitor on two consecutive days at the end of each treatment phase. ABP was recorded during the intervening 24-h period with a Spacelabs 90207 monitor. Averages of 24-h, daytime, and nighttime ABP readings correlated closely with Dinamap readings. Within-subject BP differences between fish oil and corn oil treatment were similar for Dinamap (3.2 +/- 1.8/2.5 +/- 1.0 mm Hg) and for 24-h ABP (2.5 +/- 1.0/2.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg), but were more significant with the latter. Thus detection of the antihypertensive effects of dietary intervention can be improved by the use of ABP.", 
    "12": "These studies were undertaken to determine the role of epinephrine in the anterior choroidal circulation and to define the relative contribution of adrenoceptor subtypes in this response. Intra-arterial administration of l-epinephrine (0.03-1 microgram) produced vasoconstrictor responses in the anterior choroid of anesthetized cats as measured using laser-Doppler flowmetry. Ipsilateral nictitating membrane contractions were simultaneously recorded. Responses of both organs were blocked by intravenous treatment with the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine; however, only nictitating membrane contractions were significantly antagonized with the selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. In contrast, alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade with rauwolscine had no depressant effect on the nictitating membrane but was a potent antagonist for epinephrine-induced ocular vasoconstriction. This differential ocular receptor type activation was confirmed with the use of more selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists. Both the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, methoxamine, and the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulant, B-HT 933, produced choroidal vasoconstriction when given intra-arterially. B-HT 933 was as potent as methoxamine in producing choroidal vasoconstriction which suggests a high ratio of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in this vascular bed. B-HT 933 was much less potent than methoxamine in producing contraction of the nictitating membrane. These results demonstrate the usefulness of laser-Doppler flowmetry in studies of the choroidal circulation and suggest that, unlike the nictitating membrane, epinephrine-induced anterior segment vasoconstriction is mediated by both postjunctional alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptors with alpha 2-adrenoceptors being predominant.", 
    "13": "Diastolic heart disease is common and appears to be the primary abnormality in a substantial proportion of all patients with CHF. The epidemiology and natural history of the condition appears different to that of systolic heart failure, resulting in significant morbidity although contributing little to overall mortality. Clinical assessment alone is inadequate to distinguish systolic from diastolic failure, and echocardiography is an essential investigation in the management of these patients. From a therapeutic standpoint an alternative approach to treatment is likely to be indicated, and the results of recent major trials in systolic heart failure cannot necessarily be extrapolated to this group of patients.", 
    "14": "Previous experimental investigations have shown that several neuronal systems modulate the spontaneous and paroxysmal electric activity of the hippocampus. The locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system exerts an inhibitory influence on several brain areas including the ipsilateral hippocampus. Selective destruction of the LC increases the susceptibility to epileptiform phenomena in different models of experimental epilepsy. Our experiments were conducted on 34 rats in which a steady epileptiform interictal activity of the hippocampus was obtained by means of intrahippocampal administration of penicillin. Electrical stimulation of LC caused a significant decrease of penicillin spiking of hippocampus. Stimulation sessions given 10-15 min after i.p. propranolol administration (2 mg/kg) failed to induce any significant modification in the hippocampal spiking frequency. Intrahippocampal injection of L-noradrenaline mimicked the inhibitory effect of LC electrical stimulation on hippocampus. Finally, intrahippocampal administration of isoproterenol HCl, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, caused a significant decrease of hippocampal penicillin spiking; this effect was antagonised by i.p. propranolol administration. The experimental data show a modulating influence of the LC-NA system on penicillin focal hippocampal epilepsy that probably involves beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "15": "In order to examine possible drug interactions of (R)- and (S)-propranolol a randomized, double blind, crossover study has been performed, administering orally single doses of 40 mg (R,S)- and of 20 mg (S)-propranolol. HCl three times daily over a week to reach steady state conditions. After the first single dose of 40 mg (R,S)-propranolol. HCl, the AUC0-infinity and Cmax values of the (S)-isomer were greater than those of the (R)-isomer: the ratio of AUC(S) over AUC(R) was 1.77 (P < 0.05) and that of Cmax 1.57 (P < 0.01). When (S)-propranolol.HCl was given as a single 20 mg dose, the AUC(S) value was a factor of 0.55 lower than that administration of 40 mg (R,S)-propranolol.HCl. At steady state, the AUC of (S)-propranolol was 1.52 times higher (P < 0.01) than that of the (R)-isomer after administration of 40 mg racemate, and comparing the (S)-isomer, the ratio was 1.21. Following administration of the first single dose of 40 mg of the racemate, the mean (SD) clearance of the (R)- and (S)-isomers was 110 (84) and 61 (37) ml min-1 kg-1, respectively; at steady state these values were 89 (55) and 57 (37) ml min-1 kg-1, respectively. Respective values for (S)-propranolol after single isomer administration (20 mg) were 86 (36) and 57 (25) ml min-1 kg-1 in single dose and steady state situations. The data are based on the quantitative analysis of (R)- and (S)-propranolol in plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "16": "An episode of hypoxia following the use of propranolol and sodium nitroprusside to induce hypotension in a 50-year-old male patient undergoing craniotomy for frontal meningioma is described. The importance of proper preoperative screening of lung function and intraoperative monitoring of blood gases is highlighted.", 
    "17": "The prevalence of hypertension in children, although lower than in adults, is still significant. An underlying cause is often identified in the younger patient, with essential hypertension accounting for the majority of cases in adolescents. The natural history of hypertension in childhood is still not well delineated. Previous Task Force recommendations are addressed to reflect current experience with the newer classes of agents, namely the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and the calcium channel blockers (CCBs) where either limited or no experience was previously available. In addition, the current treatment recommendations of Joint National Committee V (JNCV) are reflected in our discussion. The current drug classes are reviewed with respect to dosage guidelines, adverse effects and potential drug-drug interactions. The advantages and disadvantages of a tailored or individualised therapeutic approach as opposed to rigid stepped care therapy will be presented. Clearly, more long term data need to be obtained with respect to the safety and efficacy of the newer classes of drugs.", 
    "18": "Experience with oral sotalol, a beta-blocker with class III-antiarrhythmic properties, is limited in the pediatric population. Sotalol was administered to 32 patients with a mean age of 8.7 years (range 1 day-19.9 years). Mean dosage was 4.6 (1.5-9.4) mg/kg or 122.1 (52-306) mg/m2, respectively. In 27/32 patients, at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent had failed to control the dysrhythmia before sotalol was started. Cardiac diagnoses included normal heart (n = 16), status after correction of congenital heart disease (n = 13), and cardiomyopathy (n = 3). Success (based on symptoms and 24-h electrocardiogram) was achieved in 16/18 patients with reentry supraventricular tachycardia, in 7/8 patients with atrial flutter, and in 4/6 patients with ventricular tachycardia. During a mean follow-up of 15.6 (2-78) months, proarrhythmia occurred in five (16%) patients (symptomatic bradycardia n = 2, QT-prolongation and ventricular extrasystoles n = 1, ventricular extrasystoles n = 1, 2 degrees av-block n = 1), requiring dosage reduction (n = 3), cessation of treatment (n = 1) and pacemaker implantation in one patient, respectively. Symptomatic hypotension was noted in two patients, in whom therapy had to be stopped. Sotalol was a very effective agent for the treatment of various pediatric cardiac dysrhythmias. However, incidence of proarrhythmic effects warrants close electrocardiographic monitoring.", 
    "19": "Sustained exposure of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid, NG108-15, cells transfected to express the human beta 2-adrenoceptor (clone beta N22) to isoprenaline or iloprost (an agonist at the endogenously expressed IP prostanoid receptor) resulted in a substantial and selective down-regulation of the alpha subunit of the G-protein Gs. Treatment of these cells with the irreversible beta-adrenoceptor antagonist bromoacetyl alprenolol menthane diminished both the potency and the maximal ability of isoprenaline but not of iloprost to cause Gs alpha down-regulation. These results demonstrate that the extent of agonist-mediated Gs alpha down-regulation is dependent upon the availability of receptor to agonist.", 
    "20": "In order to explain the attenuated sympathetic support during the development of heart failure, the status of beta-adrenergic mechanisms in the failing myocardium was assessed by employing cardiomyopathic hamsters (155-170 days old) at moderate degree of congestive heart failure. The norepinephrine turnover rate was increased but the norepinephrine content was decreased in cardiomyopathic hearts. The number and the affinity of beta receptors in the sarcolemmal preparations were not changed in these hearts at moderate stage of congestive heart failure. While the basal adenylyl cyclase activity was not altered in sarcolemma, the stimulation of enzyme activity by NaF, forskolin, Gpp(NH)p or epinephrine was depressed in hearts from these cardiomyopathic hamsters. Since G-proteins are involved in modifying the adenylyl cyclase activity, the functional and bioactivities as well as contents of both Gs and Gi proteins were determined in the cardiomyopathic heart sarcolemma. The functional stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by cholera toxin, which activates Gs proteins, was markedly depressed whereas that by Pertussis toxin, which inhibits Gi proteins, was markedly augmented in cardiomyopathic hearts. The cholera toxin and pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was increased by 37 and 126%, respectively; this indicated increased bioactivities of both Gs and Gi proteins in experimental preparations. The immunoblot analysis suggested 74 and 124% increase in Gs and Gi contents in failing hearts, respectively. These results suggest that depressed adenylyl cyclase activation in cardiomyopathic hamsters may not only be due to increased content and bioactivity of Gi proteins but the functional uncoupling of Gs proteins from the adenylyl cyclase enzyme may also be involved at this stage of heart failure.", 
    "21": "A simple and sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic assay was developed for determination of timolol in human plasma following administration of two drops of a 5% timolol ophthalmic solution. A 4% butyl alcohol-hexane extract of an alkalized sample of plasma was chromatographed on a reversed-phase column and the components in the column effluent were monitored by coulometric detection. The extraction efficiency of timolol was 69.02 +/- 4.16% (mean +/- S.D.) and its detection limit was 107.2 pg/ml. The effect of mobile phase pH, buffer concentration and the working potential of the detector on column performance and the electrochemical response are described.", 
    "22": "A stereospecific high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of four diastereomers of nadolol in plasma. After the nadolol diastereomers were extracted from plasma using an Extrelut-1 solid-phase extraction cartridge, they were derivatized with (R)-(-)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylisocyanate to form urea derivatives. These derivatives were then separated on a YMC-AM-303 ODS column using water-acetonitrile (60:40, v/v). The calibration curves of (SR)-, (RS)-, (SS)-, and (RR)-nadolol were linear over the range 2.5-200 ng/ml, and the correlation coefficient (r) of the curves were higher than 0.9991 for each diastereomer. The limit of quantification was 2.5 ng/ml for each diastereomer in plasma. This method was used for a pharmacokinetic study in four dogs after oral administration of nadolol (1 mg/kg). The plasma concentrations of nadolol diastereomers showed no significant differences in Cmax, Tmax or AUC values. The assay appears to be readily applicable to the study of diastereoselective nadolol pharmacokinetics in animals and humans.", 
    "23": "The antioxidant activities of carvedilol have been demonstrated in a wide variety of test systems, including (i) physicochemical (EPR studies), (ii) biochemical (measurement of lipid peroxidation and endogenous antioxidant depletion), (iii) cellular, and (iv) in vivo. The antioxidant activity of carvedilol clearly emanates from the carbazole moiety which is unique to carvedilol. The antioxidant activity resides equally in both of the enantiomers of carvedilol, as well as in some of its metabolites which are devoid of either the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking activity or beta-adrenoceptor blocking activity. This novel antioxidant property of carvedilol may account, at least in part, for its cerebroprotection. The data discussed in this article suggest that carvedilol may not only provide effective and safe antihypertensive therapy and therefore reduce a major risk factor for stroke, but will also be better able to provide additional benefits to patients by protecting against oxygen free radicals generated during cerebral ischemia and stroke.", 
    "24": "In vitro covalent binding of a chemically reactive metabolite of propranolol to microsomal macromolecules, which is presumed to cause inhibition of its own metabolism in rats, was diminished in liver microsomes from rats pretreated with propranolol. Covalent binding was suppressed by the addition of an antibody against P450BTL, which is a cytochrome P450 (P450) isozyme belonging to the CYP2D subfamily. SDS-PAGE of microsomal proteins after incubation with [3H]propranolol and NADPH indicated that the binding was non-selective but prominent at the molecular mass of approx. 50 kDa, corresponding to those of the P450 protein. The radioactivity peak was markedly but not completely diminished by the addition of reduced glutathione. In a reconstituted system containing P450BTL, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (fp2) and dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, propranolol 4-, 5- and 7-hydroxylase activities decreased time dependently following preincubation with propranolol in the presence of NADPH, indicating time-dependent inactivation of P450BTL. The covalent binding of a reactive metabolite of [3H]propranolol to the proteins was also observed in this system. SDS-PAGE showed that among the three proteins in the reconstituted system, fp2 and P450BTL consisting of two polypeptides with molecular masses of 49 and 32 kDa, the binding was specific for a polypeptide corresponding to the P450 isozyme with a molecular mass of 49 kDa. In addition, the ratio of the amount of covalently bound radiolabelled materials to that of P450BTL which was estimated from each impaired propranolol hydroxylase activity under the same reconstitutional conditions was calculated to be approx. 1.0. These findings indicate that propranolol is a mechanism-based inactivator of a cytochrome P450 isozyme(s) belonging to the CYP2D subfamily.", 
    "25": "Eight currently underused therapeutic regimens are reviewed on the basis of their potential to have a major impact on morbidity and mortality in adults. The criteria for the selection of these regimens included their safety, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, the availability of substantial data to support their efficacy, and the existence of evidence that the regimens are underused in clinical practice. The eight regimens that meet these criteria are prophylactic aspirin therapy, estrogen replacement therapy, nicotine substitutes as adjunctive therapy in smoking cessation, beta-blocker therapy following myocardial infarction, anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of asthma, antidepressant drugs as therapy for mild depression, increased fiber intake and regular exercise.", 
    "26": "Several options are available for therapy and prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage: endoscopic sclerotherapy or endoscopic ligation, shunt surgery, intrahepatic stents (TIPS), transsection or drugs. For acute hemostasis, endoscopic procedures are still the method of choice. Application of vasopressin or somatostatin adjuvant or prior to endoscopy may be considered. Prophylaxis of first bleeding or of rebleeding should be tailored individually.", 
    "27": "Endothelial cells (EC) produce prostacyclin (PGI2) in high quantities which at the luminal surface decreases platelet aggregation and adhesion and basal to the cell relaxes smooth muscle cells (SMC). Connections have been reported between prostacyclin production, hypertension and the degree of adrenergic activation. The present study tested the hypothesis that prostacyclin production by EC could be regulated by adrenergic mechanisms. EC were isolated from human umbilical cord veins. Washed cells were seeded and grown to confluency on tissue culture dishes. The test drugs were simultaneously added to parallel dishes. Samples were collected from the conditioned medium and analyzed for 6-keto-PGF1a with RIA technique. Endothelial cells pretreated with the betaadrenoceptor blocking drugs metoprolol or propranolol synergistically increased basal prostacyclin production when exposed to betaadrenergic stimulation. However, using isomers with high or low betaadrenoblocking effect, this synergism was demonstrated not to be associated to the betaadrenoceptor blocking effect of the drugs per se. These findings may have implications on the arterial hypertensive state characterized by high sympathetic tonus and low PGI2 production. The data may offer an explanation why hypertensive individuals react with increased PGI2 production, upon betaadrenoceptor blocking therapy.", 
    "28": "We investigated the effects of subtype-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists upon aerosol antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized guinea pigs. Neither pirenzepine (muscarinic M1 receptor-selective), 4-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP, muscarinic M3 receptor-selective), [N-iminomethyl-N'-[(2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-2-cyclohexyl)-ethyl] piperazine HCl (DAC-5945, muscarinic M3 receptor-selective), ipratropium or atropine inhibited bronchoconstriction, but methoctramine (muscarinic M2 receptor-selective) produced a dose-dependent increase in bronchoconstriction (up to 46%). Methoctramine also produced increases in bronchoconstriction induced by aerosols of histamine (up to 45%) and platelet activating factor (up to 118%), demonstrating nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness. This effect of methoctramine was not inhibited by atropine, DAC-5945 or vagotomy and could not be attributed to altered arachidonic acid metabolism or beta-adrenergic antagonism. However, propranolol prevented methoctramine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, suggesting that this effect resulted from the reported ganglionic blocking activity of methoctramine. In conclusion, muscarinic receptors do not appear to play an important role in antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in anesthetized guinea pigs. Furthermore, caution should be exercised in using methoctramine to characterize the roles of muscarinic receptors in airway inflammatory responses in vivo.", 
    "29": "When acetylcholinesterase was inhibited by neostigmine, SK&F 96365 (1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride) at 10 microM caused no effect on the amplitude of single endplate potentials (e.p.p.s) but shortened the decay time in mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. However, SK&F 96365 inhibited high-frequency stimulation-evoked long-lasting depolarization of the endplate region and accelerated the run-down of trains of e.p.p.s which were eliminated within 1 s. After a train of stimulation, SK&F 96365 produced a post-tetanic depression of single e.p.p.s. The post-tetanic effect gradually dissipated with full restoration in 10-15 s. During a train of stimulation, SK&F 96365 also depressed miniature endplate potentials (m.e.p.p.s), which were restored after termination of stimuli in parallel with the recovery of e.p.p. The decay times of miniature endplate currents during recovery phases changed slightly. In control preparations not treated with neostigmine, however, SK&F 96365 did not alter the amplitude and decay time of m.e.p.p.s or e.p.p.s but accelerated the decay of succinylcholine-induced endplate depolarizations. The results suggest that SK&F 96365 facilitates nicotinic receptor desensitization in addition to blocking receptor-operated Ca2+ channels.", 
    "30": "5-HT1A receptor agonists reduce firing-dependent terminal 5-HT synthesis and release by activating somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors. We have examined the effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.1 mg/kg s.c.) on in vivo striatal 5-HT release in conscious rats with somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors inactivated by the application of pertussis toxin in the dorsal raphe nucleus. The uncoupling of 5-HT1A receptors from hyperpolarizing potassium channels was demonstrated by the inability of the intra-raphe application of citalopram to reduce striatal release (control animals had a 47% reduction, an effect prevented by previous treatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist (-)-tertatolol). Yet 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) decreased striatal 5-HT release by 66% (peak effect) in pertussis toxin-treated rats, a value comparable to that found in naive animals (74%). This raises the possibility that other 8-OH-DPAT-sensitive serotonergic receptors different from 5-HT1A autoreceptors may be involved in the control of terminal 5-HT release.", 
    "31": "Three natriuretic peptide receptors (the ANP-A, ANP-B, and clearance (C) receptors) have been reported. The regulation of these receptors by catecholamines was examined in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Treatment with norepinephrine decreased the maximum 125I-ANP binding. The competitive binding assay with des[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21, Gly22]ANP-(4-23)-NH2 (C-ANF-4-23), a specific ligand for the C receptor, revealed that the decrease in the 125I-ANP binding by norepinephrine was caused by the down-regulation of the C receptor. Isoproterenol also down-regulated the C receptor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The catecholamine-induced down-regulation of the C receptor was antagonized by a beta 2-selective adrenergic antagonist, ICI 118,551 but not by an alpha 1-, alpha 2-, or beta 1-adrenergic antagonist. Forskolin, NaF and, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also decreased the C receptor density. The isoproterenol-induced decrease in the C receptor level was further confirmed by affinity cross-linking and Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis revealed that isoproterenol and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP decreased the steady-state level of C receptor mRNA. By contrast, neither the ANP-A receptor nor the ANP-B receptor mRNA level was affected by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. The nuclear run-on assay showed that the transcriptional rate of the C receptor gene was decreased by isoproterenol, whereas those of the ANP-A and ANP-B receptor genes were unchanged. Isoproterenol attenuated the clearance of exogenously added ANP and augmented the ANP-stimulated intracellular cyclic GMP production to the same extent as the selective occupancy of the C receptor with C-ANF-(4-23), suggesting that the isoproterenol-induced enhancement of responsiveness to ANP could result not from the sensitization of the ANP-A or ANP-B receptor but from the down-regulation of the C receptor, which leads to the attenuated clearance of ANP. These findings suggest that the beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation down-regulates the C receptor through the decrease in the transcriptional rate of the C receptor gene and that the activation of the sympathetic nervous system augments the biological responsiveness to natriuretic peptides by attenuating their metabolic clearance in vascular walls.", 
    "32": "In order to address the issue of how inositol phospholipid synthesis is controlled in a resting cell we looked for enhanced [3H]phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) labelling in response to the hydrolysis of cell surface PtdIns. Bacillus thuringiensis PtdIns-PLC when added to intact bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells rapidly hydrolysed 9.1 +/- 1% of the total cellular PtdIns. This result suggests that BAE cells have a cell surface pool of PTdIns. Hydrolysis of cell surface PtdIns, in contrast to the agonist-stimulated hydrolysis of inner leaflet PtdIns, did not lead to a rapid (minutes) stimulation of PtdIns resynthesis. Prolonged incubation of BAE cells with PtdIns-PLC led to further hydrolysis of PtdIns (up to 20% of total cellular PtdIns). This second phase of PtdIns-PLC induced hydrolysis was inhibited by the addition of brefeldin A suggesting that it was dependent on vesicular traffic to the plasma membrane from the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, the above result suggests that prolonged incubation of intact cells with PtdIns-PLC leads to the slow depeletion of intracellular PtdIns stores. This second phase of PtdIns-PLC induced hydrolysis was associated with PtdIns resynthesis since prolonged incubation with PtdIns-PLC, but not B. cereus PtdCho-PLC (which does not hydrolyse PtdIns), led to enhanced PtdIns labelling. The results indicate that extracellular PtdIns-PLC induced PtdIns resynthesis may occur due to PtdIns-PLC induced intracellular PtdIns depletion.", 
    "33": "beta-Adrenoreceptor has been studied in a clonal capillary endothelial cell line established from the vascular bed of the bovine adrenal medulla. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) binding to the isolated plasma membranes from these cells has demonstrated the presence of beta-adrenoreceptors with two different affinities. The dissociation constants (Kd) have been found to be 0.27 +/- 0.09 x 10(-9) M and 2.96 +/- 0.31 x 10(-9) M, respectively with the corresponding Bmax of 5.1 +/- 0.05 and 70.0 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Inhibition of [3H]DHA binding to the beta-receptor by atenolol (a beta 1-antagonist) and ICI 118,551 (a beta 2-antagonist) has suggested that the IC50cor (= Ki) for atenolol and ICI 118,551 for high affinity site are 0.08 +/- 0.03 x 10(-12) M and 0.25 +/- 0.08 x 10(-12) M, respectively. This, therefore, indicates that both atenolol and ICI 118,551 are able to displace the bound ligand effectively but the beta 1-selective antagonist atenolol is 3 times more potent than its beta 2 counterpart, ICI 118,551. Displacement of [3H]DHA binding to the endothelial cell plasma membrane by the agonists isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine has established a relative order of Ki for these agents as isoproterenol (0.56 +/- 0.19 x 10(-9) M) < epinephrine (0.77 +/- 0.26(-9) M) > or = norepinephrine (0.71 +/- 0.24 x 10(-9) M) for the high affinity site. The corresponding values for the low affinity site, however, are 4.62 +/- 0.64 x 10(-9) M, 6.21 +/- 0.86 x 10(-9) M and 5.90 +/- 0.82 x 10(-9) M, respectively for the same agonists. Increased intracellular cAMP accompanied with cellular proliferation in the presence of isoproterenol has suggested not only the coupling of beta-adrenoreceptors to the adenylate cyclase system but also its involvement in endothelial cell proliferation.", 
    "34": "The effect of beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists, salmeterol and salbutamol on thromboxane B2 release from human airway macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes has been examined. Salbutamol (0.1-100 microM) had no inhibitory effect on the release of thromboxane B2 from human airway macrophages. Salmeterol (0.1-100 microM) caused dose-dependent inhibition of thromboxane B2 release from human airway macrophages stimulated by either zymosan or calcium ionophore A23187. This inhibition was not blocked by propranolol (1 microM). The activity of adenylyl cyclase in homogenates of human airway macrophages was increased by NaF (10 mM) by 8.5-fold and salmeterol (100 microM) and isoprenaline (10 microM) by 1.6- and 1.4-fold, respectively. Isoprenaline alone was inhibited by propranolol (1 microM). Salmeterol caused a biphasic inhibition of peripheral blood monocyte thromboxane B2 release. The inhibition at low (10 nM) concentrations of salmeterol was blocked by propranolol and that at higher concentrations (100 microM) was unaffected. The long lipophilic tail of salmeterol had similar inhibitory effects on the airway macrophages to salmeterol itself, and on the peripheral blood monocytes its action resembled that of the highest concentrations of salmeterol used. It is concluded that salmeterol inhibits mediator release from human airway macrophages by a beta-adrenoceptor independent mechanism and from blood monocytes by both beta-adrenoceptor and non-beta-adrenoceptor mechanisms. The latter mechanism may be associated with the lipophilic properties of the salmeterol molecule.", 
    "35": "The behavioural response of rats in the high light unfamiliar condition of the social interaction test of anxiety was observed following direct administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 50, 100 or 200 ng) or antagonist tertatolol (3 micrograms) into the median raphe nucleus or dorsal hippocampus. In the median raphe nucleus, 8-OH-DPAT (200 ng) significantly increased social interaction without changing locomotor activity; lower doses were inactive. In the dorsal hippocampus, bilateral injection of 8-OH-DPAT (100 ng) significantly decreased social interaction, without effect on locomotor activity; both 50 and 100 ng significantly changed grooming. Tertatolol had no effect on social interaction following administration to the median raphe nucleus, but significantly increased locomotor activity. Bilateral injection of tertatolol into the dorsal hippocampus decreased social interaction and changed grooming. These effects are similar to those of 8-OH-DPAT suggesting tertatolol may have 5-HT1A receptor agonist properties. In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors and post-synaptic receptors mediate anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects, respectively, in the social interaction test.", 
    "36": "The inhibitory potencies of selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) uptake inhibitors on isolation-induced aggressive behaviour in male mice were studied. Furthermore, the role of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the mediation of aggressive behaviour was studied. The selective 5-HT uptake inhibitors, sertraline, floxetine, femoxetine and fluvoxamine, showed weak antiaggressive effects, and citalopram and paroxetine were ineffective. This rank of potencies corresponded with neither uptake inhibitory potencies in vitro nor potentiation of 1-5-hydroxytryptophan (1,5-HTP)-induced motor effects in vivo, as citalopram and paroxetine were among the most potent compounds in these tests. A subeffective dose of 1,5-HTP (110 mumol/kg = 25 mg/kg, s.c.) potentiated the antiaggressive effect of citalopram and paroxetine more than 110 and 1600 times, respectively. The effects of sertraline, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and femoxetine were only potentiated 3, 36, 4 and 16 times, respectively. The 5-HT releasing compound fenfluramine inhibited the aggressive behaviour dose dependently, and depletion of 5-HT by treatment with p-chloro-phenylalanine methyl ester attenuated this effect significantly. p-Chloro-phenylalanine methyl ester was ineffective itself, but potentiated the antiaggressive effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamin)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). The beta-adrenoceptor/5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (-)-penbutolol, reversed the antiaggressive effects of 8-OHDPAT. In conclusion, selective 5-HT uptake inhibitors act in different ways on isolation-induced aggressive behaviour, and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors are involved in mediating the aggressive behaviour.", 
    "37": "Autoradiography and in situ hybridization were used to examine the histological distribution of the previously characterized beta 2-like adrenergic receptors involved in the bioluminescent activity of the sea pansy Renilla koellikeri. The use of [3H]-(+/-)CGP12177 as radioligand revealed autoradiographic labelling of the refringent granule-filled endoderm at the base of autozooid tentacles and autozooid columns, and in the corresponding endoderm of siphonozooid polyps, all areas where photocytes are concentrated. The presence of excess (10 microM) unlabelled (+/-)CGP12177 or atenolol in the incubation mixture substantially reduced total [3H]-(+/-)CGP12177 labelling. Under low stringency hybridization washing, human beta 2-adrenoceptor oligonucleotide probe signals were detected in granular cells located in those areas of polyp endoderm that were labelled by [3H]-(+/-)CGP12177. These cells were previously shown to be distinct from, but in close proximity to photocytes. No other cell or tissue type was labelled in polyps or throughout colonial tissues. The results suggest that a conserved form of beta 2-adrenergic receptors is present and synthesized in a unique type of endodermal cell indirectly involved in sea pansy bioluminescence control.", 
    "38": "We report the case of a 60-year-old man who presented with fever, weight loss, generalized aching, left temporal and ear pain, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 125 mm/hour. Due to the presumed diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), the patient was treated with prednisone (60 mg daily), with immediate improvement in his symptoms. Biopsy of the temporal arteries revealed no significant inflammatory infiltrate. Further evaluation included assessments of thyroid function, which revealed an elevated T4 level, low thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and suppressed radioactive iodine uptake on thyroid scintigraphy. A diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis was made, prednisone therapy was tapered over 3 weeks, and treatment with beta blockers was instituted. The patient remained asymptomatic and returned to a euthyroid state. This case illustrates that subacute thyroiditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GCA.", 
    "39": "Clones of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid, NH108-15, cells expressing differing levels of the human beta 2 adrenoceptor were isolated. Two clones were examined in detail, beta N22 which expressed some 4000 fmol/mg of membrane protein and clone beta N17 which expressed approx. 300 fmol/mg of membrane protein of the receptor. In beta N22 cells 'basal' adenylate cyclase activity measured in the presence of Mg2+ was significantly greater than that in wild-type NG108-15 or beta N17 cells. Both isoprenaline and iloprost were able to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in each of beta N22 and beta N17 membranes. However, the EC50 for isoprenaline stimulation of adenylate cyclase in membranes of beta N22 cells (6 nM) was significantly lower than that in membranes of beta N17 cells (80 nM), whereas the EC50 for iloprost stimulation of adenylate cyclase (approx. 25 nM) was the same in the two clones and in parental NG108-15 cells. The high basal adenylate cyclase activity of beta N22 cell membranes was not a reflection of higher levels of expression of the adenylate cyclase catalytic unit, as adenylate cyclase activity measured in the presence of Mn2+ was equivalent in membranes of each of wild-type NG108-15 cells and clones beta N22 and beta N17. Basal adenylate cyclase activity measured in the presence of Mg2+ in clone beta N22 was significantly reduced, however, by the beta-receptor antagonist propranolol, whereas this agent was without effect on basal adenylate cyclase activity in membranes of wild-type NG108-15 cells. These data indicate that the elevated basal adenylate cyclase cascade in NG108-15 cells expressing high levels of the beta 2 adrenoceptor represents empty receptor activation of the signalling cascade.",

A conjunctival biopsy specimen was obtained at the time of surgery. The patients were divided into four groups according to the type of topical therapy administered. The duration of therapy tended to be greater for the patients treated with a greater number of medication types. The outcome of trabeculectomy was assessed in 106 of the patients.", 
    "42": "In comparison with the briefly treated-primary surgery group, the success rate of trabeculectomy (90% [n = 28]) was similar to that in the group treated with beta-blockers (93% [n = 29]). The trabeculectomy success rate for patients treated with beta-blockers and miotics was significantly lower (72%, P < .01 [n = 29]), and that for the group treated with beta-blockers, miotics, and sympathomimetics was even lower (45%, P < .001, [n = 20]).",

Long-term topical combination therapy was identified as a significant risk factor for failure of trabeculectomy. Preoperative conjunctival cell counts from patients whose trabeculectomies were successful were compared with those whose trabeculectomies failed. Failure was associated with significantly more pale cells (P < .01), macrophages (P < .05), and lymphocytes (P < .05) in the epithelium; fibroblasts (P < .05) and macrophages (P < .05) in the superficial substantia propria; and both macrophages and lymphocytes in the deep substantia propria (P < .01). Thus, preoperative subclinical conjunctival inflammation induced by previous topical medication was identified as a risk factor for failure of trabeculectomy.",

    "48": "Because of the strong dependency of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation on the type of transient loading intervention in the in situ left ventricle (LV), experiments in the basal inotropic state in 16 open-chest anesthetized dogs were reanalyzed to find additional variables to model and predict end-systolic pressure (ESP) of both afterloading and preloading interventions by a single equation. Random-coefficients regression analysis was performed on 22 experiments in the basal inotropic state simultaneously, yielding an overall R2 of 0.97. The major part of total variance of ESP was due to linear terms of end-systolic volume (ESV) (74%) and stroke volume (SV) (19%). The SV effect was consistently negative and quantitatively quite important. An average load-independent end-systolic elastance of 6.7 mmHg/ml and an average SV effect of -5.7 mmHg/ml ejected were estimated, separating the \"force-length\" property from shortening effects in the in situ LV. History-related effects appeared to be only minor.", 
    "49": "The effect of norepinephrine (NE) on mechanisms of cellular Na+ transport in the isolated, perfused proximal tubule of Ambystoma tigrinum was examined. Single-barreled voltage and ion-selective microelectrodes were used to determine basolateral (V1), luminal (V2), and transepithelial (V3) membrane potentials and intracellular Na+ activity (alpha Nai). In CO2/HCO3- control solution, addition of NE (10(-6) M) to the bath caused depolarizations of V1, V2, and V3 are decreased alpha Nai. These effects were mimicked by isoproterenol and inhibited by propranolol. Addition of NE in the absence of luminal Na+ and substrates did not cause any changes in V1, V2, V3, or alpha Nai. NE did not affect the changes in membrane potential difference (PD) or alpha Nai caused by removal and readdition of luminal substrates and/or Na+. To study the effect of NE on Na-K-adenosinetriphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase), the pump was inhibited by external K+ removal and then reactivated by readdition of 12 mM K+ to the bath in the presence and absence of NE. Reactivation of the pump caused hyperpolarization of membrane PDs, and alpha Nai recovered monotonically in 3-5 min. The peak hyperpolarizations of V1 and V2 (approximately 1 min) were significantly larger in the presence of NE. During the first 3 min, and also at the same alpha Nai, the rate of decrease of alpha Nai was significantly faster in the presence of NE. In conclusion, these results show a direct effect of NE on cell membrane PDs and alpha Nai in the kidney proximal tubule. Most likely, beta-receptors are involved in mediating the action of NE. Neither Na/H exchange nor Na-substrate cotransport at the luminal membrane are affected by NE. On the other hand, NE activates Na-K-ATPase.", 
    "50": "Mg deficiency results in loss of red blood cell glutathione and was thought to be due to decreased Mg-dependent synthesis. The effects of vitamin E, D-propranolol, and chloroquine on red blood cell glutathione levels in Mg-deficient rats were examined. Feeding the rats a Mg-deficient diet for 3 wk resulted in an approximately 80% decrease in serum Mg and a 55% loss of red blood cell glutathione; concomitantly, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive (TBAR) materials rose 240%. All three drug treatments had no effect on the plasma Mg levels but significantly inhibited the rise in TBAR content and attenuated (60-80% effective) the loss of glutathione. Red blood cell ghost membranes from the Mg-deficient rats also exhibited 2.3-fold higher TBAR content, which was attenuated by vitamin E treatment. With isolated red blood cells from Mg-sufficient rats, loss of glutathione could be induced by a chemical oxyradical system. Direct protective effects were afforded by alpha-tocopherol and D-propranolol but not by chloroquine. The data suggest that 1) the loss of glutathione during Mg deficiency was due to increased oxidative degradation, 2) both vitamin E and D-propranolol protected by a membrane antiperoxidative action, and 3) chloroquine probably protected by diminishing prooxidant activity secondary to its inhibition of cytokine induction during Mg deficiency.", 
    "51": "Interleukin (IL)-2, a lymphokine produced by activated T-cells, stimulates T-cell proliferation and differentiation and potentiates B-cell production of antigen-specific immunoglobulins. IL-2 also increases hypothalamic norepinephrine turnover without affecting plasma corticosterone levels, which suggests that it selectively impacts on central sites that mediate sympathetic outflow to lymphoid organs. Because sympathetic stimulation during the early phases of an immunoglobulin (Ig)M plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to sheep red blood cells results in an increase in the subsequent number of antibody-forming cells, we assessed whether the enhancing effects of IL-2 on the PFC response are mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. The peak splenic IgM PFC response was increased in male Sprague-Dawley rats and BALB/c mice administered recombinant human IL-2 (50, 100 or 200 ng i.p.) in close temporal congruity with sheep red blood cell administration (i.e., 1 day before or immediately before immunization), compared with vehicle-treated controls. IL-2 administered at a later interval after immunization (i.e., 2 days) did not increase the number of antibody-forming cells. Intact sympathetic innervation of the spleen was required for the IL-2-induced immunoenhancement to occur because cutting the splenic nerve 10 days prior to IL-2 administration blocked the lymphokine's potentiation of the IgM PFC response. The immunostimulatory effects of IL-2 were also blocked in mice administered the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5 mg/kg) immediately and 1 day after IL-2 administration. The alpha adrenergic antagonist phentolamine (5 mg/kg) had no effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The activation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors in adult rat ventricular cells results in the reduction of the transient outward K+ current, but does not affect Ca++ currents. In this study, using neonatal rat ventricular cells, the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine increased the long-lasting (L-type) Ca++ channel current (dihydropyridine-sensitive) and the increase was concentration-dependent. Phenylephrine did not, however, modulate the transient-type (T-type) Ca++ channel current. The alpha-1 effect of phenylephrine was reversed or abolished by prazosin, an alpha-1 antagonist. The alpha-2 agonist clonidine had no effect on the L-type current. Yohimbine, an alpha-2 antagonist, and propranolol, a beta antagonist, did not inhibit the effect of phenylephrine on L-type current. The effect of phenylephrine was abolished by pretreatment with WB4101, an alpha-1A antagonist, but not by chloroethylclonidine, an alpha-1B antagonist. In addition, norepinephrine also increased the L-type current in the presence of propranolol and this effect was reversed by washout. These observations suggest that phenylephrine increased the L-type Ca++ channel current specifically through the activation of alpha-1A adrenergic receptors in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. This may explain in part the increase in the plateau phase of the action potential and the positive inotropic response of the neonatal myocardium to phenylephrine. This is the first description of an increase in L-type Ca++ current by alpha-1A adrenoceptor activation in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, and this effect is different from that reported in adult rat myocytes.", 
    "53": "We studied the metabolic disposition of imipramine by measuring imipramine and its metabolites in plasma and urine simultaneously after a single oral dose of 25 mg of imipramine hydrochloride administered to 16 healthy (three Japanese and 13 Korean) volunteers. Four of the subjects were poor metabolizers (PMs) of metoprolol but extensive metabolizers (EMs) of S-mephenytoin (PMML/EMMP), five subjects were EMs of metoprolol but PMs of S-mephenytoin (EMML/PMMP) and seven subjects were EMs of both metoprolol and S-mephenytoin (EMML/EMMP). The mean (+/- S.D.) oral clearances of imipramine were smaller in the PMML/EMMP group and the EMML/PMMP group than in the EMML/EMMP group, although a statistical difference (P < .05) was found only in the EMML/PMMP vs. the EMML/EMMP group. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of desipramine was 9 times greater (P < .01) in PMML/EMMP group, whereas the mean value was 0.6 times smaller (P < .05) in the EMML/PMMP group than in the EMML/EMMP group. The log10 metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratio correlated positively with the AUC of desipramine (P < .01) and with the AUC ratio of desipramine/imipramine (P < .05) but negatively with the AUC ratio of 2-hydroxyimipramine/imipramine (P < .05). Log10 percent 4'-hydroxymephenytoin excreted in 8-hr urine correlated positively with the AUC of desipramine (P < .01) and with the AUC ratio of desipramine/imipramine (P < .01).

The compound was approximately 5000-fold less potent (Ki = 230nM) in the displacement of [125I] alpha-bungarotoxin binding from the alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive nAChR subtype present in rat brain but was a potent inhibitor (Ki, 2.7 nM) of [125I] alpha-bungarotoxin binding to the nAChR subtype in Torpedo electroplax, which is similar to that present in the neuromuscular junction. Functionally, (+/-)-epibatidine enhanced 86Rb+ flux in IMR 32 cells with an EC50 value of 7 nM. It was some 3000-fold more potent than (-)-nicotine (EC50 value, 21,000 nM) and was approximately 150-fold more potent (EC50 value, 0.4 nM) than (-)-nicotine (EC50 value = 60 nM) in increasing [3H]dopamine release from rat striatal slices.

    "55": "Gastric mucosal hyperemia associated with elevated serum gastrin level has been suggested in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). Clinical evidence has shown that these patients may benefit from propranolol administration. The aim of this study was to investigate effect of propranolol on gastric mucosal perfusion and serum gastrin level in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy. Gastric mucosal perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. Measurements were performed under basal conditions and after observer-blind administration of propranolol (30-60 mg/day, N = 9) or placebo (N = 9) for seven days. Placebo had no effect on either gastric mucosal perfusion or serum gastrin level. In contrast, propranolol administration significantly decreased both antrum gastric mucosal perfusion (from 0.88 +/- 0.28 to 0.73 +/- 0.26 V, P < 0.05) and corpus gastric mucosal perfusion (from 0.94 +/- 0.35 to 0.78 +/- 0.25 V, P < 0.05). However, this drug had no effect on serum gastrin level. We conclude that chronic propranolol administration in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive gastropathy may reduce gastric mucosal perfusion without changing serum gastrin level.", 
    "56": "The neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was injected intraperitoneally in mice and caused an acute inhibition (of over 60%) of gastrointestinal motility, which was measured by the transit of charcoal. This inhibition was not related to conversion of MPTP to MPP+. Administration of the beta-adrenergic blocker propranolol significantly reduced, but did not completely block, the effect of MPTP. The dopaminergic blocker haloperidol also partly reversed the effects of MPTP. When these blockers were administered together, the action of MPTP was fully blocked. The results indicate that the toxin acted by releasing catecholamines (presumably norepinephrine and dopamine), thereby inhibiting motility.", 
    "57": "The cardiovascular response to beta-adrenergic stimulation is markedly blunted with advancing age, and this blunting may underlie some of the prominent age-associated changes in the hemodynamic profile during dynamic exercise. To examine this hypothesis, we administered the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol (0.15 mg/kg IV) to 25 healthy normotensive men ages 28 to 72 years from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) immediately before maximal upright cycle ergometry with 99mTc gated cardiac blood pool scintigraphy. Their hemodynamic responses to exercise were compared with those of 70 age-matched healthy unmedicated male BLSA control subjects. The maximal cycle work rate achieved was similar in propranolol-treated men (158 +/- 32 W) and control subjects (148 +/- 32 W) and declined similarly with age in both groups. Hemodynamics at seated rest were not age-related in either group; however, propranolol-treated men had lower heart rates (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), ejection fraction, and cardiac index than control subjects but higher end-diastolic volume index (EDVI) and end-systolic volume index (ESVI) by covariance analysis. At maximal effort, several striking age-drug interactions were evident: Propranolol caused a greater reduction in HR and greater increases in EDVI and stroke volume index (SVI) in younger than in older men. Hence, at maximal work rate, HR declined less with age in the propranolol group (0.46 versus 1.09 beats per minute per year, P < .05 by covariance analysis); EDVI and SVI decreased with age (0.27 and 0.48 mL/m2 per year, respectively) after propranolol compared with increases of 0.47 and 0.16 mL/m2 per year in control subjects, respectively, each P < or = .05 by covariance analysis. The left ventricular contractility index, SBP/ESVI, at exhaustion was reduced by propranolol to a greater extent in younger than older men. Thus, acute beta-adrenergic blockade reverses the age-associated ventricular dilation at end diastole and end systole observed during upright cycle exercise and blunts the decline in maximal HR and myocardial contractility. These data suggest that the age-associated declines in maximal HR and left ventricular contractility during vigorous exercise are manifestations of reduced beta-adrenergic responsivity with advancing age which is partially offset by exercise-induced ventricular dilation.", 
    "58": "Pharmacological control of rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation may be difficult in some patients. Alternative treatments, including curative surgery or atrioventricular (AV) node ablation with pacemaker implantation, have significant potential morbidity. In view of evidence that dual AV nodal physiology may exist in a significant percentage of the population, even in those without AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, we postulated that control of ventricular response might be achieved by radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation in the region of the AV nodal slow pathway with its short refractory period.", 
    "59": "Ten patients underwent attempted AV node modification using a 4-mm-tipped electrode catheter positioned in the middle or posterior septum, between the His bundle and coronary sinus ostium on the tricuspid valve annulus. RF energy was applied at 16 to 30 W for up to 60 seconds, until average ventricular response fell below 100 beats per minute. Reduction of maximal ventricular response below 120 beats per minute was confirmed with atropine 1 mg IV. If required, additional ablations were performed progressively more posteriorly up to the coronary sinus ostium. Patients with successful AV node modification were discharged off AV node-blocking drugs and followed in the clinic at regular intervals. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory ECG recordings and/or treadmill stress tests were obtained before and after ablation for statistical comparison of maximum ventricular rate. Resting average ventricular rate was determined during electrophysiology study before and after ablation. In 7 of 10 patients (70%), maximum ventricular rate was reduced from a mean of 164 +/- 12 to 123 +/- 16 beats per minute (P < .01) and average ventricular rate from a mean of 128 +/- 11 to 83 +/- 10 beats per minute after ablation. Mean minimum ventricular rate was 54 +/- 11 beats per minute after ablation. These 7 patients have remained symptom free from rapid ventricular response for a mean of 14 +/- 8 months (range, 1 to 22). Three remain off all AV node-blocking drugs, 3 remain on digoxin alone, which was previously ineffective, and 1 remains on a beta-blocker for angina. In the 3 patients who did not respond to AV node modification, complete AV node ablation and permanent pacemaker implantation was performed in 2 and DC cardioversion after amiodarone loading was performed in 1.",

    "61": "The tumor-promoting activity of two beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents, propranolol and atenolol, was tested in a two-stage protocol of hepatocarcinogenesis in male and female Fischer 344 rats. Propranolol is a lipophilic non-selective beta-blocker mainly eliminated via the liver; atenolol is a hydrophilic beta 1-selective blocking agent, mainly eliminated via the kidney. Animals were initiated with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) and, after 17 days of recovery, were continuously treated with propranolol (75-100 mg/kg) or atenolol (300 mg/kg) by gavage for up to 21 months. Rats given phenobarbital (0.05% in the diet) were used as positive controls. After 2, 4 and 8 months of promotion, preneoplastic lesions were quantified by staining sections of liver for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). In non-initiated rats, neither propranolol nor atenolol influenced the development of spontaneous preneoplastic or neoplastic liver lesions. The results obtained in DEN-initiated rats given propranolol cannot be unequivocally interpreted. In the male, propranolol seemed to be ineffective. In the female, there was weak enhancement of DEN-induced GGT foci at 4 and 8 months and of neoplastic lesions thereafter. However, there was great interindividual variability in focus and tumor yields. Unfortunately, due to the high incidence of liver tumors in rats given DEN alone and the small number of propranolol-treated rats that survived until the end of the experiment, no definite conclusion can be drawn about the modifying potential of this beta-blocker on liver carcinogenesis. There was no evidence of liver tumor promotion in DEN-initiated rats of either sex given atenolol.",

These nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) relaxations were frequency-dependent (1 to 32 Hz) and inhibited by either tetrodotoxin or Nw-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 100 microM). The selective cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) type IV inhibitors rolipram (3 microM) and Ro 20-1724 (3 microM) significantly potentiated NANC relaxations at each frequency of stimulation. The selective cGMP-specific PDE type V inhibitor zaprinast (3 microM) failed to significantly alter the maximal NANC response, but it caused a slight potentiation of the response at lower frequencies. The adenylyl cyclase stimulant forskolin, the nitric oxide donor compound 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), and the guanylyl cyclase stimulant sodium nitroprusside caused concentration-dependent relaxation of histamine-contracted airway smooth muscle. Rolipram significantly potentiated the relaxation elicited by forskolin. Rolipram also potentiated responses to SIN-1 and sodium nitroprusside.

    "78": "Oxidative metabolic pathways of propranolol consist of naphthalene ring-hydroxylations (at the 4-, 5-, and 7-positions) and side-chain N-desisopropylation in mammals. We characterized cytochrome P450 isozymes responsible for propranolol metabolism, especially N-desisopropylation and 5-hydroxylation, in human liver microsomes. 4-Hydroxy, 5-hydroxy-, and N-desisopropylpropranolol were detected as primary metabolites, whereas 7-hydroxypropranolol was in trace amounts. Good correlations were obtained for activities of propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylases with immunochemically determined CYP2D6 content, whereas correlations of these activities with CYP1A2, CYP2C, or CYP3A4 content were relatively low. The activities also correlated highly with debrisoquine 4-hydroxylase, compared with other metabolic activities such as phenacetin O-deethylase, hexobarbital 3'-hydroxylase, and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase, which are typical reactions for CYP1A2, CYP2C, and CYP3A4, respectively. Propranolol N-desisopropylase activity in the samples highly correlated with CYP1A2 content and phenacetin O-deethylase activity, but not with the other P450 isozyme contents or metabolic activities. Quinidine, a specific inhibitor of CYP2D6, inhibited propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylase activities selectively and in a concentration-dependent manner. alpha-Naphthoflavone, a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, inhibited all of the propranolol oxidation activities, and the IC50 value for N-desisopropylase activity was much smaller than the values for ring-hydroxylase activities. Antibody directed to CYP2D inhibited propranolol 4- and 5-hydroxylase activities by 70% at an antibody/microsomal protein ratio of 1.0. Anti-CYP2C9 antibody did not inhibit any activity determined.

    "80": "The large increase in propranolol (PL) bioavailability when administered with food cannot be entirely explained by a transient increase in hepatic blood flow. A change in metabolic capacity or tissue uptake induced by changes in insulin and/or glucagon associated with food ingestion may contribute to the food effect. This hypothesis was tested in three groups of four isolated, perfused rat livers in the single-pass mode. PL (20 micrograms/ml) was infused to steady state at 30 ml/min for 120 min, then washed out for 30 min. Insulin or glucagon at 2 x 10(-9) M, or saline (control), was introduced at 70 min. Although neither insulin nor saline perturbed effluent PL or metabolite steady-state concentrations, glucagon caused a transient (15-min) reduction in PL, N-deisopropylpropranolol, propranolol glycol, and naphthoxylactic acid, indicating increased PL uptake, but not a change in metabolic activity. PL uptake was 668 +/- 108 micrograms/g liver tissue overall, and additional uptake after initiation of glucagon infusion was significant at 29 +/- 11.6 micrograms/g liver tissue (4% of initial uptake). Although the increase in PL uptake was small under the described conditions, this interaction with glucagon may contribute to the food effect. In this model system, hormonal effects on PL metabolism were not observed.",

The required load is selected from a pre-study ergometry with stepwise increasing load. Repeated testing with this protocol was shown to yield highly reproducible ergometric HR-responses. Because of their high reliability, the ergometric endpoints and increments permit a highly sensitive comparison of beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism across dose and time within a given compound. The relationship between the changes of the ergometric rise of HR and the beta 1-adrenoceptor occupancy (estimated from radioreceptor assay data) permits to evaluate the ergometric efficiency of different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists across time and doses and to identify eventual differences that do not relate primarily to the extent of beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonism itself.",

The patients were recruited from the medical out-patients' department of the University Hospital of Troms\u00f8. The pathophysiological changes which cause hypoglycaemia unawareness are today not clear. Reduced peripheral tissue sensitivity to catecholamines is suggested as one of several mechanisms which may contribute. For further investigation of beta-adrenergic sensitivity an isoprenaline/metoprolol sensitivity test was performed. Isoprenaline and metoprolol were administered intravenously, and the effects on heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and plasma levels of adrenaline (ADR) and noradrenaline (NA) were measured. All subjects were given the same doses of isoprenaline (0.25-8 micrograms) and metoprolol (0.5-8 mg). Metoprolol was given together with the dose of isoprenaline which increased heart rate by 25 beats min-1. The dose/response curves of both isoprenaline/HR and metoprolol/HR were significantly shifted to the right in IDDM-patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness compared with controls and IDDM-patients with hypoglycaemia awareness (P < 0.05). Reduced sensitivity of isoprenaline stimulation has also been shown before, whereas reduced sensitivity of a blocking agent has not earlier been shown. These findings support the hypothesis of reduced beta-adrenergic sensitivity as one pathophysiological component in hypoglycaemia unawareness.",

Specifically, we examined (1) to what degree autonomic and behavioral \"stress\" reactions during intermittent confrontations between an intruder male adult Long-Evans rat with an aggressive resident undergo habituation, and (2) to what extent the defeat-experienced animal can be protected against these \"stress\" reactions with clonidine or metoprolol, two adrenergic agents with clinical anxiolytic effects. We developed an acute social stress situation that consisted of initially placing an experimental rat as an intruder into the homecage of a resident while the resident was not present, thereafter permitting brief physical agonistic interactions with the reintroduced resident until the intruder was forced into a submissive supine posture and emitted ultrasonic vocalizations (USV), and eventually exposing the intruder to the resident's threats for one hour, while being shielded from potentially injurious attacks (\"threat encounter\"). Over the course of the initial 4-weekly threat encounters the acute tachycardia but not the hyperthermic stress responses decreased in magnitude. Following the first three threat encounters core temperature (Tc) was significantly elevated for at least 3 h. The Tc was already elevated when the repeatedly defeated intruder was confronted with the olfactory cues of the resident's cage. This conditioned \"anticipatory\" hyperthermia developed in the course of the first three confrontations and was paralleled by a decrease in exploratory and motor behavior and by an increase in defensive behaviors and in both types of USV emitted in the \"low\" (20-30 kHz) and the \"high\" (31-70 kHz) frequency range. Clonidine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, IP), an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist and metoprolol, a beta-adrenergic blocker (1.0-10.0 mg/kg, IP), dose-dependently prevented the tachycardic response to stress. Only clonidine, but not metoprolol, also attenuated the rise in Tc during the 1-h agonistic interaction. Clonidine decreased those aspects of motor behavior (e.g. rearing, walking) that are of lesser \"cost\" for the individual but maintained high levels of defensive reactions and increased the duration of \"low\" USV. The high doses of clonidine (0.06, 0.1 mg/kg) attenuated the homeostatic regulation and sedated the intruder while exposed to threats during a social confrontation. The absence of attenuation of the high level of defensive behavior and the prolonged \"low\" USV suggest a stress intensification by the higher doses of clonidine. In conclusion, after the fourth encounter, the autonomic, behavioral and vocal response pattern prior to and during repeated weekly confrontations show no evidence for habituation for the following 6 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Pressure and blood flow measurements (radioactive microsphere method) were performed before and following drug administration. ICI 118,551 significantly decreased portal tributary blood flow (21%), portal pressure (4%) and cardiac index (12%). Portal tributary blood flow decreases were significantly more marked than changes in cardiac index. Atenolol significantly decreased portal tributary blood flow (27%), portal pressure (15%), cardiac index (17%) and arterial pressure (7%). Propranolol significantly decreased portal tributary blood flow (37%), portal pressure (17%), cardiac index (30%), and arterial pressure (9%). Portal tributary blood flow decreases due to ICI 118,551, but not those due to atenolol, were significantly less marked than the decreases caused by propranolol. ICI 118,551- and atenolol-induced cardiac index decreases were significantly less marked than propranolol-induced decreases. In conclusion, in rats with cirrhosis, selective beta 2-blockade reduces portal pressure and portal tributary blood flow mainly by a direct effect on splanchnic vessels. This portal hypotensive action, however, was slight. Propranolol decreases portal tributary blood flow by the combination, but not the summation, of its beta 1- and beta 2-blocking effects.",

Thirty-nine symptomatic beta blocker ingestions were found. The patients ranged from 14 to 67 years of age. Thirty-one (80%) of those who demonstrated symptoms did so within 2 h of ingestion. This number rose to thirty-eight (97%) by 4 h postingestion. Only one patient developed symptoms after more than 4 h of asymptomatic observation. The development of bradycardia and first degree atrioventricular block during observation appeared to predict toxicity in this patient who suddenly developed hypotension 6 h postingestion. No patient required treatment for delayed cardiovascular depression if they remained asymptomatic during a 4-h period of observation postingestion and demonstrated a normal electrocardiogram throughout. Whether the risk of delayed onset of toxicity after 6 h of asymptomatic observation is sufficiently low to warrant \"medical clearance\" requires further investigation.", 
    "86": "Potassium accumulation in rat heart after alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation has previously been reported from indirect measurements. Here we present data on intracellular potassium content measured directly in the heart. Isolated rat hearts perfused in a non-recirculating system were exposed to alpha-1-adrenoceptor stimulation (5 x 10(-5) mol/l phenylephrine in the presence of 10(-6) mol/l timolol). 14C-Sucrose was used to estimate the extracellular space. From heart homogenates intracellular potassium, magnesium and cellular water contents were determined and the ion concentrations calculated accordingly. The intracellular magnesium content remained unchanged during all experimental conditions. alpha-1-Adrenoceptor stimulation evoked an increase in potassium content by 9% (4, 14; 95% confidence interval (CI), P = 0.0006). Due to an observed increase in intracellular water by 17% (9, 26; 95% CI, P = 0.0006), the potassium concentration apparently decreased by 8% (0.3, 15; 95% CI, P = 0.04). During partial inhibition of the Na+/K(+)-ATPase by 10(-5) mol/l ouabain, there was an increase in potassium content by 5% (1, 9; 95% CI, P = 0.008). There was, however, no significant increase in intracellular water in this situation. Calculated intracellular potassium concentration showed accordingly a slight increase. The effects upon potassium and water both in the absence and presence of ouabain were eliminated by the alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (10(-6) mol/l). alpha-1-Adrenoceptor stimulation apparently increased cellular dry weight by 10% (2, 18; 95% CI, P = 0.02). Changes in translocation of potassium and water must be considered as part of the alpha-1-adrenergic heart effects.",

We have evaluated metoprolol permeation through full thickness hairless rat skin in vitro following electroporation with an exponentially decaying pulse. Application of electric pulses increased metoprolol permeation as compared to diffusion through untreated skin. Raising the number of twin pulses (300 V, 3 ms; followed after 1 s by 100 V, 620 ms) from 1 to 20 increased drug transport. Single pulse (100 V, 620 ms) was as effective as twin pulse application (2200 V, 1100 V or 300 V, 3 ms; followed after 1 s by 100 V, 620 ms). In order to investigate the effect of pulse voltage on metoprolol permeation, 5 single pulses (each separated by 1 min) were applied at varying voltages from 24 to 450 V (pulse time 620 ms). A linear correlation between pulse voltage and cumulative metoprolol transported after 4 h suggested that voltage controls the quantity of drug delivered. Then, the effect of pulse time on metoprolol permeation was studied by varying pulse duration of 5 single 100 V pulses from 80 to 710 ms (each pulse also separated by 1 min). Cumulative metoprolol transported after 4 h increased linearly with the pulse time. Therefore, pulse time was also a control factor of the quantity of drug delivered but to a lesser extent than the voltage at least at 100 V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

On the basis of drug disappearance from the intestinal lumen and its appearance into the vascular outflow, the mean time required for permeation across the intestinal membrane (MPT) and the permeation clearance (CLp) were calculated. MPT values of water, antipyrine, propranolol, imipramine and mannitol, varied from 0.45 min to 9.91 min depending on their physicochemical property. From both MPT and CLp, five drugs were classified as being (i) highly and rapidly absorbed (water, antipyrine), (ii) highly but slowly absorbed (propranolol, imipramine) and (iii) low and slowly absorbed (mannitol). Permeation profiles of these drugs were analyzed based on the diffusion model which defined the parameter for each permeation process, i.e. partitioning to and diffusion through the epithelium and clearance into the blood flow. Propranolol and imipramine partitioned into the membrane at a higher level than the other drugs. However, the clearance of both drugs from the epithelium was extremely slow, suggesting that this process is the rate-limiting step in their permeation. On the other hand, the rate-limiting step in the permeation of water and antipyrine was found to be the diffusion process in the epithelial layer.", 
    "89": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport system for H1-antagonists was studied using primary cultured bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC). The uptake of [3H]mepyramine was inhibited by various H1-antagonists. Ketotifen competitively inhibited [3H]mepyramine uptake with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 46.8 microM. Lipophilic basic drugs such as propranolol, lidocaine and imipramine significantly inhibited [3H]mepyramine uptake. In particular, propranolol inhibited [3H]mepyramine uptake competitively at an inhibition constant (Ki) of 51.1 microM. Moreover, in ATP-depleted BCEC, [3H]mepyramine uptake was stimulated by preloading with H1-antagonists and lipophilic basic drugs. These results indicated that H1-antagonists are transported across the BBB via a carrier-mediated transport system common to lipophilic basic drugs.", 
    "90": "A slight induction of cellular differentiation (myelocytes and granulocytes) of HL-60 cells occurred after treatment with anti-tumor agents etoposide (VP-16), mitoxantrone (MXT), mitomycin C (MMC), actinomycin D (Act-D) or novobiocin (NOVO). Addition of sphinganine (SP), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) enhanced (2-3 fold) the VP-16, MXT, MMC or Act-D-induced differentiation but not the NOVO-induced differentiation. No induction of differentiation was observed with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the absence or presence of SP. The addition of SP in the fresh medium after the removal of VP-16, MXT, or MMC (0.5 h treatment) enhanced the induction of differentiation. In contrast, SP post-treatment did not have any effect on enhancing the differentiation which was induced by Act-D short exposure (0.5 h). In an attempt to characterize the biochemical requirements for potentiation of VP-16-induced differentiation, we examined the effects of calcium depletion using calcium chelator ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) or calcium channel blocker verapamil. Potentiation of VP-16-induced differentiation by SP was not observed in EGTA- or verapamil-treated cells. Calcium supplementation to the cells during the treatment with EGTA restored the SP-potentiation of VP-16-induced differentiation. Our results also showed that the induction of differentiation was accompanied by a decrease in PKC activity (70% of the control). PKC activity decreased to a greater extent (50% of control) in SP potentiation of differentiation induction. Our results suggested that calcium-dependent biological action of antitumor agents and the inhibition of PKC activity are required for SP-potentiation of differentiation induction.", 
    "91": "Overflow of endogenous noradrenaline from rat isolated trachea was evoked by electrical field stimulation (3 Hz, 540 pulses) in the presence of yohimbine, desipramine and tyrosine. Isoprenaline 100 nmol/l increased the evoked overflow of noradrenaline by about 65%. This effect was antagonized by propranolol (100 nmol/l) and the beta 2-selective adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (100 nmol/l), but not by the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 A (100 nmol/l). The beta 2-selective adrenoceptor agonist formoterol (1-100 nmol/l) also facilitated the evoked overflow of noradrenaline, but maximally by only about 25% at 10 nmol/l, i.e. formoterol behaved as a partial agonist at these facilitatory beta-adrenoceptor. This assumption is also supported by the observation that formoterol (10 nmol/l) acted as antagonist against isoprenaline (100 nmol/l). Mechanical removal of the mucosa resulted in a 30% decrease in tissue noradrenaline and a 55% reduction of the evoked overflow of noradrenaline. In mucosa-denuded preparations isoprenaline failed to facilitate noradrenaline overflow. In the presence of indomethacin (3 mumol/l) the evoked overflow of noradrenaline from mucosa containing preparations was increased by about 50%, but isoprenaline still further facilitated the evoked noradrenaline overflow by about 40%. In conclusion, the overflow of noradrenaline in the rat trachea is facilitated via beta 2-adrenoceptors, an effect which requires an intact airway mucosa.",

We recently described a capsaicin-sensitive vagal pathway mediating non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) relaxations of an isolated, innervated rostral guinea-pig tracheal preparation. These afferent fibres are carried by the superior laryngeal nerves and relaxations elicited by their activation are insensitive to autonomic ganglion blockers such as hexamethonium. In the present study this vagal relaxant pathway was further characterized. 2. Relaxations of the trachealis elicited by electrical stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive vagal afferents were mimicked by bath application of capsaicin. Relaxations elicited by both methods were abolished when the tissue between the trachea and the adjacent oesophagus was disrupted. Indeed, separating the trachea from the oesophagus uncovered a contractile effect of capsaicin administration on the trachealis. 3. Capsaicin-induced, oesophagus-dependent relaxations of the trachealis were blocked by pretreatment with the fast sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX). By contrast, capsaicin-induced contractions of the trachealis (obtained in the absence of the oesophagus) were unaffected by tetrodotoxin. 4. Substance P, neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) also elicited NANC relaxations of precontracted trachealis that were abolished by separating the trachea from the oesophagus or by TTX pretreatment. Like capsaicin, the tachykinins elicited only contractions of the trachealis following TTX pretreatment or separation of the trachea from the adjacent oesophagus. 5. Relaxations elicited by stimulation of the capsaicin-sensitive nerves were unaffected by a concentration of the tachykinin NK2 receptor-selective antagonist, SR 48968, that is selective for NK2 receptor blockade and were not mimicked by the NK2 receptor-selective agonist [beta-Ala8]-NKA(4-10). This suggests that NK2 receptors are not responsible for these relaxations. By contrast, the NK3 receptor-selective agonist, senktide analogue, and the NK1 receptor-selective agonist, acetyl-[Arg6, Sar9, Met (O2)11]-SP(6-11), elicited oesophagus-dependent relaxations of the trachealis that were abolished by oesophagus removal. Furthermore, pretreatment with the NK1-selective antagonists, CP 96345 and CP 99994, or pretreatment with a concentration of SR 48968 that also blocks NK3 receptors, markedly attenuated relaxations elicited by stimulation of the capsaicin-sensitive vagal pathways. 6. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that relaxations elicited by stimulation of capsaicin-sensitive vagal afferents involve tachykinin-mediated activation of peripheral NANC inhibitory neurones that are in some way associated with the oesophagus. The data also indicate that airway smooth muscle tone might be regulated by peripheral reflexes initiated by activation of capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibres.", 
    "93": "Catecholamines can offset the negative effect of acidosis and raised extracellular K+ concentration in the isolated rabbit heart when these factors are changed with similar kinetics and concentrations as those observed in exercise. This effect appears to be mediated by changes in Ca2+ handling in the heart. To test the role of Ca2+ in vivo, we studied the interactive effects of infusions of KCl, lactic acid, norepinephrine (NE), and CaCl2 on cardiovascular performance in the anesthetized rabbit. After propranolol, CaCl2 was given during acidosis and hyperkalemia. Acidosis (arterial pH 7.17 +/- 0.3) markedly reduced cardiac performance, and its effects were exacerbated by hyperkalemia (7.3 +/- 0.4 mM). NE reversed the cardiac response to combined acidosis and hyperkalemia. After propranolol, arterial pH and arterial K+ concentration changed more rapidly with acidosis and hyperkalemia, combined with a faster fall in cardiac performance, but CaCl2 offset these negative hemodynamic effects. The rises in plasma Ca2+, NE, and sympathetic activity during exercise may therefore interact to ameliorate the harmful effects of acidosis and hyperkalemia.", 
    "94": "Macrophages have been shown to possess both alpha 2 and beta 2-adrenergic receptors which appear to antagonize each other. The ability of these two kinds of receptors to mediate macrophage secretion was tested, using alpha- and beta-antagonists, idazoxan and propranolol. Both antagonists could inhibit hydrogen peroxide and superoxide secretion, although the timing of the inhibition is different. However, only idazoxan has the ability to reduce nitrite accumulation, while propranolol fails to affect macrophage production. In addition, sodium nitrite was able to inhibit hydrogen peroxide and superoxide secretion, and hydrogen peroxide could reduce nitrite accumulation, suggesting that a negative cross-feedback mechanism exists.", 
    "95": "The essential goal of medical treatment following myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction must be the prevention of secondary cardiac failure. The existence of left ventricular dysfunction, in particular when it is not accompanied by clinical cardiac failure, is a virtually formal indication for beta-blocker treatment after an infarction. Beta-blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) are possibly better tolerated in this context. However, experience shows that cardiologists and general practitioners often remain reluctant to prescribe beta-blockers whenever left ventricular function is impaired. Converting enzyme inhibitors decrease the risk of onset of secondary cardiac failure, reduce sudden deaths by ventricular arrhythmias, reduce recurrences of myocardial infarction or unstable coronary insufficiency, and more generally reduce overall and cardiovascular mortality. This is a class effect. While there is no urgency to prescribe them during the acute phase, it is generally considered that it is extremely useful to give them fairly quickly, i.e. during the first 72 hours. At the end of the hospital phase, around two weeks, it is desirable, whenever possible, to prescribe a dose of the order of 75 mg/day of captopril or 2.5 mg/day of ramipril. The administration of aspirin can be considered virtually routine. Oral anticoagulants are desirable in the presence of a large akinetic pocket, a frequent starting point of thrombosis and/or systemic emboli, or in the presence of atrial fibrillation. Digitalis/diuretic treatment does not appear to be indicated at this stage. Other types of anti-ischemic treatment are not theoretically indicated as a matter of principle at this stage in the absence of residual ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "96": "The effect of corticosterone (CS) synthesis inhibition with metyrapone-a blocker of the 11 beta-hydroxylase (150 mg/kg IP)-on immobility time during the forced swim test was recorded. Immobility time was measured during a 15-min forced swim (test). Twenty-four hours later rats were subjected to an additional 5 min forced swim (retest). In one experiment, metyrapone or vehicle was administered 3 h before the initial test, while CS (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg SC) was administered 1 h prior to the initial test. Metyrapone significantly reduced immobility time during both test and retest. This effect was reverted in a dose-dependent fashion by CS. In a second experiment, animals exposed to the initial test 24 h before were injected with metyrapone or vehicle 3 h before the retest, while CS (0, 10, or 20 mg/kg SC) was administered 1 h prior the retest. Metyrapone, administered before the retest, reduced immobility time and CS partially reverted metyrapone effect. In another group of animals, serum CS concentrations were evaluated before and after test and retest. In vehicle groups, the high immobility time during test and retest was associated with high CS serum concentrations poststress. In animals receiving metyrapone prior to the initial test, the reduced immobility time was related to low levels of CS after the test and an attenuated secretion following the retest. Moreover, CS (20 mg/kg) and metyrapone+CS groups had high CS levels before the test, which remained high 2 h after the test, although after the retest, both groups showed a pattern of CS secretion similar to that observed in vehicle animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "1. Homologues of dendrotoxin (Dtx) were isolated from the crude venom of Green and Black Mamba snakes and examined for K+ channel blocking activity in neonatal rat dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs) by whole-cell patch clamp recording. 2. Outward potassium current activated by depolarization was composed of two major components: a slowly inactivating current (SIC, tau decay approximately 50 ms, 200 ms and 2s), and a non-inactivating current (NIC, tau decay > 2 min). Tail current analysis revealed two time constants of deactivation of total outward current, 3-12 ms and 50-150 ms (at -80 mV) which corresponded to SIC and NIC, respectively. 3. All the homologues (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-Dtx and toxins I and K) blocked outward current activated by depolarization in a dose-dependent manner. The most potent in blocking total outward current was delta-Dtx (EC50 of 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM), although there were no statistically significant differences in potency between any of the homologues. 4. Qualitative differences in the nature of the block were noted between homologues. In particular, the block by delta-Dtx was time-dependent, whereas that by alpha-Dtx was not. 5. alpha-Dtx was a much better blocker of SIC (EC50 = 1.0 +/- 0.4 nM) than was delta-Dtx (EC50 = 17.6 +/- 5.8 nM). Furthermore, delta-Dtx was selective for NIC (EC50 +/- 0.24 +/- 0.03 nM) over SIC and reduced the slow component of tail currents (NIC), preferentially. On the other hand, a-Dtx did not significantly distinguish between SIC and NIC although tail current analysis showed that a-Dtxpreferentially reduced the fast component of tail currents (SIC).6. The results confirm, using direct electrophysiological methods, that homologues of dendrotoxins from Mamba snake venom block K+ channels in rat sensory neurones. Furthermore, a-Dtx and 6-Dtx distinguish between sub-types of K+ channels in these cells and may thus be useful pharmacological tools in other neuronal K+ channel studies.", 
    "98": "1. The possible existence of atypical beta-adrenoceptors in vascular smooth muscle of the rat common carotid artery was examined in this study. 2. Isoprenaline produced concentration-dependent relaxation of noradrenaline (10(-7) M) precontracted ring segments of the carotid artery. The relaxation was not affected by endothelial denudation. 3. Propranolol (10(-8) M-3 x 10(-7) M) shifted the isoprenaline curve to the right without suppressing the maximum response. However, the slope (0.74) of the Schild plot was significantly (P < 0.05) less than 1. 4. Salbutamol (beta 2), CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 (beta 3) also concentration-dependently relaxed noradrenaline precontracted artery segments. These relaxations were not affected by propranolol (10(-7) M). Pretreatment of the artery segments with BRL 37344 did not desensitize the tissue to the relaxant effect of isoprenaline, CGP 12177 and salbutamol. 5. It is concluded that atypical beta-adrenoceptors exist in vascular smooth muscle of the common carotid artery.", 
    "99": "1. ZENECA ZD7288 (4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino) pyrimidinium chloride, formerly ICI D7288) is a novel sino-atrial node function modulator which selectively slows heart rate. 2. The haemodynamic effects of ZD7288 (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg-1, i.v.) have been evaluated and compared with those of placebo (physiological saline), zatebradine (ULFS 49, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg kg-1, i.v.) and propanolol (0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg kg-1, i.v.) in beagles chronically instrumented for measurement of heart rate, aortic pressure, aortic flow and dPLV/dtmax. The dogs were trained to run at 6.5 k h-1 on a level treadmill for 5 min at half hourly intervals over a period of 4 h. Drugs were dosed cumulatively after the second, fourth and sixth exercise periods. 3. Control experiments demonstrated a degree of accommodation to repeated exercise over a period of 4 h. Resting heart rate decreased by 21 beats min-1, but heart rate response to exercise was maintained, whereas dPLV/dtmax at rest remained steady while the response to exercise decreased significantly (by 25% after 2 h, P < 0.05). 4. ZD7288 and zatebradine both decreased heart rate during exercise in a dose-dependent manner, whilst heart rate at rest did not differ from resting heart rates in saline dosed control animals. In contrast, heart rate at rest and during exercise were lowered equally by the lowest doses of propranolol (approximately by 30 beats min-1), and additional doses caused only minor additional decreases. The exercise-induced tachycardia was maintained within 12% of pre-dose levels, presumably by withdrawal of vagal tone.5. Cardiac inotropism, as indicated by dPLv/dt max, was not affected by ZD7288 or zatebradine at rest,although the inotropic response to exercise decreased in proportion to the decreases in exercise-induced tachycardia. Propranolol caused a marked dose-dependent decrease in the exercise-induced inotropic response (by 85% at 0.3mg kg-1).6. Whilst the sino-atrial node modulators increased stroke volume at rest, and augmented increases in response to exercise, propranolol did not affect resting stroke volume and decreased the responses to exercise.7. Cardiac output at rest and cardiac output increases during exercise were well maintained in the presence of ZD7288 and zatebradine in contrast to propranolol which induced a significant depression of cardiac output, both at rest and during exercise. Propranolol also caused significant systemic vasoconstriction.8. In conclusion, ZD7288 has haemodynamic actions comparable to those of zatebradine despite their chemical dissimilarity. ZD7288 may be of benefit in the treatment of ischaemic heart disease by reducing heart rate without impairing cardiac function.", 
    "100": "1. ZENECA ZD7288 (4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino) pyrimidinium chloride, formerly ICI D7288) is a novel sino-atrial node function modulator which selectively slows sinus node rate. Its effects on haemodynamic function have been studied in pentobarbitone anaesthetized dogs, in comparison with zatebradine, atenolol and nitrendipine. 2. ZD7288 lowered heart rate in the dose-range 0.02 to 1.0 mg kg-1 i.v. from 152 to 77 beats min-1. Myocardial contractile function (measured as both dPLV/dtmax and right ventricular free wall developed force) decreased along with rate. Stroke volume increased as rate decreased. Cardiac output decreased at doses in excess of 0.2 mg kg-1, i.v. 3. These haemodynamic changes were reversed when heart rate reduction was reversed by atrial pacing and are, therefore, considered to be indirect consequences of heart rate changes induced by ZD7288. 4. The effects of zatebradine paralleled those of ZD7288 (heart rate reduced from 149 to 60.5 beats min-1 over the dose-range 0.02 to 1.0 mg kg-1, i.v.), except that dPLV/dtmax did not decrease with heart rate and increased during arial pacing. 5. Neither ZD7288 nor zatebradine had significant effects on atrio-ventricular conduction at intrinsic heart rates, but both significantly and dose-dependently prolonged the atrio-ventricular conduction interval during atrial pacing at 180 beats min-1. 6. The observed effects of atenolol were commensurate with removal of beta-sympathetic cardiac drive. Atrial pacing was found not to restore the pre-atenolol heamodynamic state completely. 7. Nitrendipine up to 0.2 mg kg- i.v. induced changes indicative of direct vasodilatation accompanied by reflex compensation, followed by cardiac depression at higher doses. Atrial pacing failed to compensate for the effects of vasodilatation, but caused atrio-ventricular conduction block at doses above 0.5mgkg-1, i.v.8.data show ZD7288 has marked heart rate slowing properties and that accompanying haemodynamic changes appear to be secondary to the rate changes, being reversed by atrial pacing even in the continued presence of the drug. Heart rate slowing without depression of contractile function should prove to be of benefit in the treatment of myocardial ischaemia, particularly in the presence of myocardial dysfunction.", 
    "101": "1. The pharmacological actions of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, celiprolol, bisoprolol and propranolol were investigated in human lung tissue by radioligand binding experiments as well as in human isolated bronchi by functional experiments in organ baths. 2. Data from lung tissue were compared to those obtained from myocardial membranes. 3. Lung tissue was obtained from 10 patients having undergone lung resection for bronchial carcinoma and myocardial tissue from a patient who had received a heart transplantation. 4. In radioligand binding experiments, celiprolol exhibited a high affinity binding to beta 1-adrenoceptors in heart and a low affinity binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors in lung tissue. The selectivity obtained for the beta 1-adrenoceptor was calculated to a factor of eleven. 5. Compared to bisoprolol and propranolol, celiprolol elicited the lowest affinity for the beta-adrenoceptor, as judged from the K1-values. 6. In the absence and presence of the guanine nucleotide Gpp(NH)p celiprolol did not affect receptor binding. 7. In functional experiments on intact bronchi, celiprolol, bisoprolol and propranolol failed to produce relaxation (+/- forskolin) or a significant difference in efficacy in antagonizing the relaxant effects of isoprenaline. However, a rank order of potencies was revealed (propranolol:bisoprolol:celiprolol = 46:12:1). 8. Plasma concentrations for celiprolol and bisoprolol usually achieved in vivo were below the IC50 value obtained in vitro. In contrast, for propranolol, plasma concentrations were nearly identical with the IC50 value. 9. It is concluded that celiprolol is a selective beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist on human heart and has no agonistic properties on intact human bronchi. Compounds such as celiprolol and bisoprolol may in comparison to propranolol, possess reasonable therapeutic advantages in the treatment of patients with obstructive lung disease due to their low affinity for beta 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "102": "The Joint National Committee Reports IV (1988) and V (1992) have emphasized individualization of drug therapy for patients with hypertension-a departure from the \"stepped\" care approach of initiating therapy with diuretics as advocated by the JNC I-III in the 1970's and 1980's. This review highlights individualization or \"patient profiling\" using calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment strategy for patients with primary hypertension--especially in the patient who has attendant risk factors and sequelae. The calcium channel antagonists, especially effective in elderly and Black patients, have proven efficacy in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy and improving diastolic function in patients with hypertensive heart disease. The heart rate limiting calcium antagonist, verapamil, has been found effective in outcome trials of reducing death and reinfarction rates post myocardial infarction and is an alternative therapy for the beta blocker intolerant hypertensive post myocardial infarction. More vascular specific dihydropyridines (felodipine, isradipine, and amlodipine) may be preferable to rate limiting agents in hypertensives with sinus node or AV conduction disorders and in those with impaired left ventricular systolic function. Verapamil and diltiazem have been effective in preliminary trials in reducing proteinuria and preserving renal function in both diabetic and non diabetic hypertensives. Calcium channel antagonists appear to prevent the progress of atherosclerosis independent of their antihypertensive properties. Further, they have theoretic value in improving endothelial mediated vasodilation.", 
    "103": "It is well-established that administration of moderate doses of the adrenal catecholamines epinephrine or norepinephrine shortly after training results in the enhancement of later retention performance in laboratory animals. These substances, released endogenously as a result of arousal, are thought to modulate memory processes by stimulating peripheral receptors that send neural messages to the brain, thus altering the memory storage process. The applicability of this hypothesis to the modulation of memory processes in humans was tested in this experiment by using elderly subjects who were chronically taking beta-receptor antagonist medications to control hypertension. A moderate level of muscle-tension-induced arousal was produced by having subjects squeeze a hand dynamometer during the initial storage and recall of highlighted words in short 200-word paragraphs. Twenty young normal individuals, 22 normotensive elderly subjects, 21 elderly subjects taking either calcium-channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control hypertension, and 21 elderly subjects taking beta-blocker antihypertensive medications served as subjects. The young subjects, normal elderly subjects, and those taking non-beta-blocker medications all showed enhanced long-term recognition performance as a result of the arousal manipulation. However, those subjects chronically taking beta-receptor-antagonist medications showed no enhancement of memory.",

    "111": "Adrenergic regulation of epididymal Cl- currents was studied by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique using various alpha- and beta-receptor agonists and antagonists in primary cultured rat cauda epididymal cells. Cl- currents could be activated with varying frequency by noradrenaline (primarily alpha- and beta 1-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, 1-5 microM), isoprenaline (nonselective beta-adrenoceptor agonist, 5 microM), salbutamol (beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, 2 microM), and phenylephrine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor-selective agonist, 1-2 microM). Noradrenaline alone elicited Cl- current activation in 85% of the cells examined. In the presence of phentolamine (nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, 15 microM), noradrenaline elicited Cl- current activation in 63% of the cells examined, whereas noradrenaline-induced activation was observed in 33% of the cells examined in the presence of both atenolol and butoxamine (beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively, 10 microM). In 27% of single cells examined, a second current activation in response to salbutamol was observed after the first response to phenylephrine. When the order of stimuli was reversed, dual activation was also observed in 22% of the single cells examined, indicating the presence of both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors in single epididymal cells. Profiles of time- and voltage-dependent Cl- current upon activation by different adrenoceptor agonists exhibited characteristics similar to those previously reported for Ca2+ and cAMP-activated Cl- currents, suggesting that regulation of epididymal Cl- conductances could be mediated by different adrenoceptor subtypes involving Ca2+ and cAMP as intracellular second messengers.",

The method involved liquid extraction of 1045U85 and an internal standard (propranolol) from plasma, followed by reaction with a chiral derivatizing reagent, GITC. The diastereoisomeric products were then separated by reversed-phase LC. The range of quantitation was 9.828-0.121 micrograms ml-1 for total 1045U85 (3.440-0.042 micrograms ml-1 for the RR and SS isomers, and 1.474-0.018 micrograms ml-1 for the RS and SR isomers). Specificity of the method for 1045U85 was demonstrated using spiked plasma samples as well as plasma samples from dosed animals. Extraction recovery of 1045U85 and propranolol was greater than 95%, and the derivatization reaction was shown to be complete. Accuracy (% bias) ranged from -2.6 to 3.9% for total 1045U85 and from -4.7 to 14.1% for the individual stereoisomers. Precision (% RSD) was 3.8-8.7% for total 1045U85 and 2.9-16.5% for the individual isomers. Plasma samples stored at -70 degrees C were stable for 19 weeks.

Administration of NIP (6-12 mg/d) for 3-12 months produced progressive improvement of endoscopic findings over time (30% for C, 25% for F, and 40% for the R-C sign after 12 months). At the last examination (mean: 9 +/- 4 months), the improvement rates were 16.7%, 16.7% and 22.7%, respectively. No significant relationship was found between endoscopic improvement and the Child-Pugh score or the dose of NIP. Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in five patients: one had bleeding esophageal varices, three had bleeding gastric varices, and one had a bleeding gastric ulcer. The systolic blood pressure was decreased significantly (4.6-12.3%) at 2 weeks as well as 1 and 2 months, and the heart rate showed a significant decrease throughout the study (10-18.4%). With the exception of the patients who had gastrointestinal bleeding, no symptoms of decompensation appeared, and there was no deterioration of laboratory parameters including ammonia. Adverse effects occurred in about 10% of the patients, most of which were related to bradycardia and/or hypotension, and they improved when the drug was withdrawn or the dose reduced. These results suggest that long-term administration of NIP is useful in the treatment of esophageal varices.",

Liver is a central organ of these processes. The metabolic fate of a single oral atenolol and metoprolol dose and their actions on carbohydrate- and lipid parameters have been investigated. Healthy male rats received a dose reducing heart beat/min by 25% (atenolol: 6 mg/kg; metoprolol: 10 mg/kg). About 9% of atenolol is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 (P-450). P-450-dependent functions (aminopyrine-N-demethylase, hexobarbital biotransformation time) were not inhibited. Serum bilirubin was normal. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels of the plasma were not affected. Transient blood glucose increase was measured returning to initial value at 120 min. Metoprolol is metabolized by hepatic monooxygenases. P-450-dependent functions were inhibited correlating to the lowered P-450-content of the microsomes. High TG level and decreased HDL-cholesterol content were measured. Blood glucose was significantly high. The liposoluble metroprolol affected the hepatic functions more than the hydrophilic atenolol. The monitoring of blood glucose during beta-receptor antagonist treatment may be suggested.", 
    "115": "Behavioral contexts can evoke a variety of autonomic modes of response, characterized by reciprocal, coactive, or independent changes in the autonomic divisions. In the present study, we investigated the reactive autonomic control of the heart in response to psychological stressors, using quantitative methods for analyzing single and double autonomic blockades, and through the use of noninvasive indices based on heart period variability and systolic time intervals. Analysis of the effects of pharmacological blockades revealed an overall pattern of increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic control of the heart during speech stress, mental arithmetic, and a reaction-time task. Unlike the classical reciprocal sympathetic-parasympathetic response to orthostatic challenge, however, the responses of the autonomic branches to stress were uncorrelated. This reflected notable individual differences in the mode of autonomic response to stress, which had considerable stability across stress tasks. The putative noninvasive indices of sympathetic (preejection period) and parasympathetic (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) control changed in accord with the results of pharmacological blockades. Together, these results emphasize the substantial individual differences in the mode of autonomic response to stress, the advantages of a quantitative approach to analyzing blockade data, and the importance of validity estimates of blockade data.", 
    "116": "Heart period, systolic time intervals, low and high frequency heart period variability, blood pressure, and respiration were measured in female subjects under three drug conditions (saline, atropine sulfate, metoprolol) while sitting and standing on three consecutive days. Following preinfusion baseline recordings, saline, metoprolol (14 mg), or atropine sulfate (2 mg) was infused for 15 min (by using a double-blind procedure). Recordings were taken during a postinfusion baseline and in response to an orthostatic stressor (standing versus sitting postures). At the end of the metoprolol session, atropine sulfate was infused and responses were monitored during the postinfusion (i.e., double blockade) baseline and during orthostatic stressor. Analyses of the blockade data revealed that the preejection period (PEP) reflected sympathetic but not vagal influences on the heart, and high frequency (HF, 0.12-0.40 Hz) heart rate variability (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) reflected vagal but not sympathetic influences on the heart. No other measure provided a specific index of the tonic sympathetic or vagal activation of the heart. Postinfusion PEP under saline predicted individual differences in postinfusion cardiac sympathetic activation, whereas postinfusion heart period (but not HF variability) under saline predicted individual differences in postinfusion cardiac vagal activation."
