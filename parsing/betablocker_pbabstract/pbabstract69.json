The purpose of this review is to describe the risk of sudden death, to assess which of the criteria conventionally used as indication for a primary prevention defibrillator placement in adults are applicable in children with HCM, and to review differences in management between Europe and North America.", 
    "1": "There is no uniform 'annual mortality rate' in childhood, and the risk of sudden death is at its highest level between 8 and 16 years. There are no significant differences between sudden death fatality rates in childhood HCM in Europe, North America and Australia when patients presenting with sudden death as the first sign of disease are excluded. The criteria for primary prevention defibrillator placement in adults with HCM are, with the exception of previous cardiac arrest and ventricular tachycardia on Holter monitoring, not predictive of risk in childhood HCM, and further research is required to establish better criteria for primary prevention in children.", 
    "2": "Most children diagnosed with HCM have a favorable prognosis with life-style modification with additional medical therapy, surgical therapy, and/or defibrillator placement in selected patients. The challenges inherent in identification of the patients most likely to benefit from invasive therapies and avoidance of these therapies in those least likely to benefit (and most likely to experience harm) exist on both sides of the Atlantic.", 
    "3": "Landiolol hydrochloride is a new \u03b2-adrenergic blocker with a pharmacological profile that suggests it can be administered safely to patients who have sinus tachycardia or tachyarrhythmia and who require heart rate reduction. This study aimed to investigate whether intraoperative administration of landiolol could reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery.", 
    "4": "Of the 200 consecutive patients whose records could be retrieved between October 2006 and September 2007, we retrospectively reviewed a total of 105 patients who met the inclusion criteria: no previous permanent/persistent AF, no permanent pacemaker, no renal insufficiency requiring dialysis, and no reactive airway disease, etc. Landiolol infusion was started after surgery had commenced, at an infusion rate of 1 \u03bcg/kg/min, titrated upward in 3-5 \u03bcg/kg/min increments. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those who received intraoperative \u03b2-blocker therapy with landiolol (landiolol group) and those who did not receive any \u03b2-blockers during surgery (control group). An unpaired t test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare between-group differences in mean values and categorical data, respectively.", 
    "5": "Seventeen of the 105 patients (16.2%) developed postoperative atrial fibrillation: 5/57 (8.8%) in the landiolol group and 12/48 (25%) in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P=0.03). The incidence of AF after valve surgery and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting was lower in the landiolol group, although the difference between the groups was not statistically significant.", 
    "6": "Our retrospective review demonstrated a marked reduction of postoperative AF in those who received landiolol intraoperatively. A prospective study of intraoperative landiolol for preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation is warranted.", 
    "7": "Owing to the drug's favorable hydrophilic and pharmacokinetic characteristics, a number of case reports have demonstrated effective treatment of atenolol overdose with hemodialysis. However, the efficiency of atenolol clearance throughout hemodialysis treatments has not previously been examined. In this report, a patient with impaired renal function was successfully treated with two 5-hour intermittent high-flux high-efficiency hemodialysis therapies after atenolol overdose. Serial atenolol levels were measured during his hemodialysis treatments. We observed an over 50% plasma atenolol concentration reduction after each 5-hour hemodialysis therapy. Hemodialysis therapy is an effective treatment for atenolol overdose, especially in patients with impaired renal function.",

Genetic testing eventually confirmed the diagnosis of both ARVD and LQTS, which combined, to our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature.", 
    "9": "Atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF) is a common complication of open heart surgery and ACC/AHA guidelines strongly recommend the use of prophylactic beta-blockers (BB) for its prevention. Several recent studies, however, have failed to show the desired protective effects of BB against post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) AF. As the protocols of CABG, medical management of CAD (coronary artery disease) and demographic features of the patients undergoing open heart surgery have evolved significantly over the last two decades, we decided to perform a review of evidence from latest randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to confirm the efficacy of prophylactic BB.", 
    "10": "We searched for RCTs comparing the efficacy of prophylactic BB versus placebo/control against post-CABG AF. We limited our search to 1995 till present to reflect ongoing advancements in the protocols of CABG and the medical management of CAD. Initially, 34 trials were selected; however after certain exclusions only 10 RCTs were included in the final analysis.", 
    "11": "Prophylactic BB decreased the incidence of post-CABG AF from 32.8% in the control group to 20% in the prophylactic group with risk ratio (RR) of 0.50 with 95% CI of 0.36-0.69, P value < 0.001. In a subgroup analysis, carvedilol appears to be superior to metoprolol for the prevention of postoperative AF.",

    "13": "During recent years there has been increasing interest in the Lycopodium alkaloid huperzine A as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases. This study aimed to characterize huperzine A's permeability across the enterocyte barrier along the gastrointestinal tract with an emphasis on the effect of ionization on the drug absorption. Intestinal permeability of huperzine A was evaluated by in vitro Caco-2 and parallel artificial membrane permeation assay models and by the ex vivo Ussing chamber model. The permeability rate was strongly dependent on the degree of ionization and increased with elevation of the donor medium pH in all studied models. The transport of the unionized fraction was similar to the permeability of the markers for passive transcellular diffusion. Addition of the paracellular permeability modulator palmitoylcarnitine in the Caco-2 model led to significant enhancement in the permeability of the ionized huperzine A fraction. No evidence of active transport of huperzine A was detected in this study. The Ussing chamber model experiments showed similar drug permeability along the entire rat intestine. In conclusion, huperzine A permeates the intestinal border mainly by passive transcellular diffusion whereas some fraction, dependent on the degree of huperzine A ionization, is absorbed by the paracellular route. Huperzine A's permeability characteristics pave the way to the development of its oral extended release dosage form. The specific population of the potential users of huperzine A and the high potency of this molecule support the rationale for such a delivery.", 
    "14": "During the first 2 wk of mouse postnatal development, transient retinal circuits give rise to the spontaneous initiation and lateral propagation of depolarizations across the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Glutamatergic retinal waves occur during the second postnatal week, when GCL depolarizations are mediated by ionotropic glutamate receptors. Bipolar cells are the primary source of glutamate in the inner retina, indicating that the propagation of waves depends on their activation. Using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based optical sensor of glutamate FLII81E-1\u03bc, we found that retinal waves are accompanied by a large transient increase in extrasynaptic glutamate throughout the inner plexiform layer. Using two-photon Ca(2+) imaging to record spontaneous Ca(2+) transients in large populations of cells, we found that despite this spatially diffuse source of depolarization, only a subset of neurons in the GCL and inner nuclear layer (INL) are robustly depolarized during retinal waves. Application of the glutamate transporter blocker dl-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (25 \u03bcM) led to a significant increase in cell participation in both layers, indicating that the concentration of extrasynaptic glutamate affects cell participation in both the INL and GCL. In contrast, blocking inhibitory transmission with the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine and the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine increased cell participation in the GCL without significantly affecting the INL. These data indicate that during development, glutamate spillover provides a spatially diffuse source of depolarization, but that inhibitory circuits dictate which neurons within the GCL participate in retinal waves.", 
    "15": "Atrial arrhythmia (AA) is the most common complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Only beta-blockers and amiodarone have been convincingly shown to decrease its incidence. The effectiveness of magnesium on this complication is still controversial. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of magnesium as a sole or adjuvant agent in addition to beta-blocker on suppressing postoperative AA after CABG.", 
    "16": "We searched the PubMed, Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, Cochrane library databases and online clinical trial database up to May 2012. We used random effects model when there was significant heterogeneity between trials and fixed effects model when heterogeneity was negligible.", 
    "17": "Five randomized controlled trials were identified, enrolling a total of 1251 patients. The combination of magnesium and beta-blocker did not significantly decrease the incidence of postoperative AA after CABG versus beta-blocker alone (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.47, P = 0.40). Magnesium in addition to beta-blocker did not significantly affect LOS (weighted mean difference -0.14\u2009days of stay, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.29, P = 0.24) or the overall mortality (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08-4.56, P = 0.62). However the risk of postoperative adverse events was higher in the combination of magnesium and beta-blocker group than beta-blocker alone (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.66-4.71, P = 0.0001).", 
    "18": "This meta-analysis offers the more definitive evidence against the prophylactic administration of intravenous magnesium for prevention of AA after CABG when beta-blockers are routinely administered, and shows an association with more adverse events in those people who received magnesium.", 
    "19": "This study investigated the effects and possible mechanism of ferulic acid, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, on endogenous glutamate release in the nerve terminals of the cerebral cortex in rats. Results show that ferulic acid inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by the K\u207a channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The effect of ferulic acid on the evoked glutamate release was prevented by chelating the extracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a ions, but was insensitive to the glutamate transporter inhibitor DL-threo-beta-benzyl-oxyaspartate. Ferulic acid suppressed the depolarization-induced increase in a cytosolic-free Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration, but did not alter 4-AP-mediated depolarization. Furthermore, the effect of ferulic acid on evoked glutamate release was abolished by blocking the Ca(v)2.2 (N-type) and Ca(v)2.1 (P/Q-type) channels, but not by blocking ryanodine receptors or mitochondrial Na\u207a/Ca\u00b2\u207a exchange. These results show that ferulic acid inhibits glutamate release from cortical synaptosomes in rats through the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca\u00b2\u207a entry.",

    "21": "ZOLMITRIPTAN, PROPRANOLOL OR BOTH WERE TESTED IN TWO RAT MODELS OF PORTAL HYPERTENSION: common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and CCl4-induced cirrhosis. In these animals we measured different hemodynamic parameters including portal venous pressure, arterial renal flow, portal blood flow and cardiac output. We also studied the changes in superior mesenteric artery perfusion pressure and in arterial wall cAMP levels induced by zolmitriptan, propranolol or both. Moreover, we determined the effect of splanchnic sympathectomy on the response of PVP to zolmitriptan.", 
    "22": "In both models of portal hypertension zolmitriptan induced a dose-dependent transient descent of portal pressure accompanied by reduction of portal flow with only slight decrease in renal flow. In cirrhotic rats, splanchnic sympathectomy intensified and prolonged zolmitriptan-induced portal pressure descent. Also, propranolol caused more intense and durable portal pressure fall when combined with zolmitriptan. Mesenteric artery perfusion pressure peaked for about 1 min upon zolmitriptan administration but showed no change with propranolol. However propranolol enhanced and prolonged the elevation in mesenteric artery perfusion pressure induced by zolmitriptan. In vitro studies showed that propranolol prevented the inhibitory effects of \u03b22-agonists on zolmitriptan-induced vasoconstriction and the combination of propranolol and zolmitriptan significantly reduced the elevation of cAMP caused by \u03b22-agonists.", 
    "23": "Zolmitriptan reduces portal hypertension and non-selective beta-blockers can improve this effect. Combination therapy deserves consideration for patients with portal hypertension failing to respond to non-selective beta-blockers.", 
    "24": "We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose propranolol for treatment of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) in China. Our prospective study included data from 89 patients with IH, aged 1-12 months. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, and aldosterone were measured before initiation of propranolol therapy. Patients were administered propranolol (0.75-1 mg/kg/day) under close observation. The volume, texture, and color of lesions were used to evaluate efficacy. Safety endpoints included heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, thyroid function tests, and fasting blood glucose. Adverse effects were recorded. Mean plasma angiotensin II concentration in patients with IH was higher than that in age-matched healthy children, whereas mean plasma renin activity was lower. Mean aldosterone level was higher at 1-3 months but lower at 4-12 months, than values reported previously. After propranolol therapy for 6 months, IH regression was classed as grade IV in 44 patients (49.4 %), grade III in 21 patients (23.6 %), and grade II in 24 patients (27.0 %); none were grade I. Mild adverse effects, including diarrhea, restless sleep, nausea, cold extremities, and hypoglycemia, occurred in 12 patients (13.5 %). Slight decreases in heart rate and blood pressure occurred in all patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The IHs of four patients (4.5 %) relapsed after treatment cessation at 4-5 months.",

Total absence of sexual activity is registered in 30% of HF patients. Moreover, HF-induced reduction in exercise tolerance, side effects of HF medications and the coexistence of shared risk factors between HF and sexual dysfunction may further aggravate the sexual health of HF patients. The purpose of this review is to examine the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the association of erectile dysfunction (ED) and HF, the potential therapeutic approaches and the eventual indications for sexual activity in HF patients. Medline and Cochrane Library search was performed from January 1970 through October 2012 to retrieve relevant papers outlining the association between ED and HF. Many evidences have outlined a tight association between ED and HF pathophysiological standpoint. Shared risk factors, common pathogenic traits and epidemiologic association represent some of the links between these conditions. Erectile dysfunction has been recognized as an earlier predictor of cardiovascular events; moreover, HF itself may cause and/or worsen ED because of its particular feature and co-morbidities. Furthermore, some cardiovascular drugs may contribute to impaired erectile function. In stable patients with stable HF, sexual activity is generally not contraindicated but it should be encouraged, as a form of moderate-intensity physical exertion. An effective treatment of ED in HF patients should be founded on the correction of reversible risk factors, on the choice of cardiovascular drugs with the lowest effect upon patient's erectile function, and on the use of phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors. Physicians should be aware of the close relation between HF and ED and of the related clinical and therapeutic implications, in order to improve patients quality of life and clinical outcome.", 
    "31": "The separation of the four nadolol stereoisomers on Chiralpak\u00ae AD by chiral liquid chromatography was carried out at both analytical and preparative scales. A screening of possible mobile-phase compositions was performed using different alcohol-hydrocarbon mixtures. The results obtained confirm the use of 20:80:0.3 ethanol-hexane-diethylamine reported by McCarthy (1994) but introduce other possibilities for the complete resolution of the four nadolol stereoisomers at analytical scale, namely, the mixtures 30-40:70-60:0.3 ethanol-heptane-diethylamine. Additionally, this work describes how retention and resolution depend on the ethanol content in hexane and heptane mixtures. The separation of nadolol stereoisomers is also carried out at preparative scale and different alcohol-hydrocarbon compositions are proposed, depending on the target component to be obtained. Particularly, this work presents the experimental separation of the more retained nadolol stereoisomer (RSR-nadolol) by simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography using an 80:20:0.3 ethanol-heptane-diethylamine mobile phase. For a 2 g/l feed concentration, RSR-nadolol is 100% recovered at the extract outlet stream, 100% pure, and with a system productivity of 0.65 g(RSR-nadolol)/(l(bed)(.)h) and a solvent consumption of 9.6 l(solvent)/g(RSR-nadolol).",

Although benign, infants with IH can experience complications including ulceration, visual and airway impairment, and residual scarring and disfigurement. It is often challenging for clinicians to predict which tumors are in need of systemic treatment. However, data from various demographic and other studies have revealed further insights into this tumor.

    "33": "Cardiac CaV1.2 channels play a critical role in cardiac function. It has been proposed that the carboxyl-terminal intracellular tail of the CaV1.2 channel is the target of Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent regulation of the channel. Recent studies on C-terminal truncated forms of the CaV1.2 channel reported neonatal death, reduced CaV1.2 current, and failure of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation of these channels in ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs). Here, we used atrial CMs at embryonic day 18.5 that expressed a C-terminal truncated form of the CaV1.2 channel (Stop/Stop). Surprisingly, the atrial CMs showed robust L-type Ca(2+) currents which could be stimulated by forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. These currents exhibited a left-ward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve and a reduced sensitivity to the Ca(2+) channel blocker isradipine as compared to currents in wild-type atrial CMs. RT-PCR analysis revealed normal levels of mRNA for the CaV1.2 channel but a twofold increase in the level of mRNA for the CaV1.3 channel in the Stop/Stop atrium as compared to wild-type atrium. A Western blot analysis indicated an increase of CaV1.3 protein in the Stop/Stop atrium. We suggest that, in contrast to Stop/Stop ventricular CMs, Stop/Stop atrial CMs can compensate the functional loss of the truncated CaV1.2 channel with an upregulation of the CaV1.3 channel.",

Whether \u03b23-adrenoceptors (ARs) also play any role in muscle protein metabolism still remains uncertain. By using rat L6 myocyte cultures, we found that CL316,243, a \u03b23-AR selective agonist, at the concentration of 10(-6)\u2009M for 24\u00a0h, induced a significant increase of skeletal muscle constitutive proteins such as H- and L-myosin and \u03b2-actin. Such effect was correlated to an increased expression of phosphorylated p70(S6K) that was significantly inhibited by \u03b23-AR antagonist, SR 59230A, but not by \u03b22-AR antagonist, ICI-118,551. The CL316,243-induced activation of p70(S6K) was markedly inhibited by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, suggesting a critical involvement of the PI3K-mTOR-p70(S6K) signaling cascade in the anabolic response of L6 cells to \u03b23-AR agonist. Taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of \u03b23-AR in skeletal muscle cells activates a specific signaling pathway leading to protein synthesis and, eventually, muscle growth.",

Increased binder content had the effect of increasing the granule particle size and drug dissolution rate. The effect of inlet air temperature and product endpoint temperature was found to be more pronounced in case of granule particle size parameters. Within the studied intervals, the optimal quantity of binder as well as optimal process parameters were identified and validated using response surface methodology. Utilizing these optimal process and formulation parameters, successful scaling up of the fluid bed melt granulation process was carried out.

    "41": "The role of \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation on viral myocarditis has been investigated in animal models. The beneficial action of the \u03b2-blocker carvedilol in murine viral myocarditis can be explained partly by the resulting heart rate reduction and the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production. The modulation of myocardial necrosis and contractile dysfunction by proinflammatory cytokines may be partially mediated by the production of nitric oxide (NO). The selective I(f) current inhibitor ivabradine reduces the heart rate without affecting cardiac contractility and has been shown to be cardioprotective in failing hearts. However, little is known about the effects of ivabradine in viral myocarditis, and in particular, its effects on inducible NO synthase (iNOS) have not been investigated. This study was therefore designed to examine the effects of ivabradine in murine viral myocarditis. In a coxsackievirus B3 murine myocarditis model, the effects of ivabradine and carvedilol on the myocardial histopathological changes and fibrosis, NO production, iNOS protein and cytokine levels were studied. Both ivabradine and carvedilol similarlyattenuated myocardial lesions and fibrosis, inhibited NO synthesis by iNOS, and decreased the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. These results show that ivabradine has a therapeutic benefit in murine CVB3-induced myocarditis. The beneficial effects of ivabradine in viral myocarditis are partially mediated by the inhibition of both the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the synthesis of NO by iNOS.",

The assay can be used to identify ligand binding to \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptors, but also the downstream response can be determined in the same assay. Both the quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET) and the DiscoveRx PathHunter assay formats allow the use of intact cells. The homogeneous QRET technique is a single-label approach based on nonspecific quenching of the time-resolved luminescence, enabling agonist and antagonist receptor binding measurements. The commercial PathHunter assay is in turn based on enzyme fragment complementation, which can be detected on the basis of chemiluminescence signal. In the PathHunter technology the enzyme complementation is recorded immediately downstream of agonist-induced receptor activation. The new multiparametric detection technology combines these two assay methods enabling the identification of agonist, and antagonist binding to the receptor, and the agonist-induced response. Using the QRET and the PathHunter methods a panel of \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor ligands (epinephrine, terbutaline, metaproterenol, salmeterol, propranolol, alprenolol, bisoprolol, ICI 118,551, and bucindolol) was tested to prove the assay performance. The signal-to-background ratio for tested ligands ranged from 5 to 11 and from 6 to 18 with QRET and PathHunter, respectively.

The solid dispersion was optimized by investigating the effects of the weight ratios of Tween 80/PVP K30 and carrier/drug on the aqueous solubility of CV. The optimum solid dispersion consisted of a relatively low carrier to drug weight ratio: the weight ratio of CV/PVP K30/Tween 80 was 12/4/2. Unlike conventional methods of solid dispersion preparation, this method yielded CV-loaded solid dispersion with no change in the crystallinity of the drug as was evident from SEM, DSC and XRD. It was demonstrated that the solid dispersions prepared had hydrophilic carriers attached to the surface of the drug, thus changing it from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic form without changing the crystalline form. The optimized solid dispersion improved the drug solubility and dissolution rate by about 11,500-fold and twofold, respectively. It was further suggested that this method of solid dispersion preparation is better than conventional methods in terms of environmental and industrial standpoints. Thus, it was concluded that CV-loaded solid dispersion prepared using this method would be of use for delivering poorly water-soluble CV with enhanced solubility and dissolution, but without crystalline changes.",

    "69": "In pancreatic \u03b2-cells, glucose metabolism leads to closure of ATP sensitive K\u207a channels (K(ATP) channel) and Ca\u00b2\u207a influx, which is regarded as a required step for triggering of insulin release. Here, we demonstrate that glucose triggers rapid insulin release independent from its action on K(ATP) channels given the cellular cAMP is elevated. We measured insulin release from rat pancreatic islets by static and perifusion experiments. Changes in cytosolic free Ca\u00b2\u207a concentration ([Ca\u00b2\u207a]i) were monitored using fura-2 loaded rat pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Glucose-induced insulin release was abolished when Ca\u00b2\u207a influx was inhibited by a combination of 250 \u03bcM diazoxide, an opener of K(ATP) channel, and 10 \u03bcM nifedipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent Ca\u00b2\u207a channels. However, with both nifedipine and diazoxide, glucose induced a 5-fold increase in insulin release in the presence of 10 \u03bcM forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. In the presence of diazoxide, nifedipine, and forskolin, 22 mM glucose sharply increased the rate of insulin release within 2 min which peaked at 6 min: this was followed by a further gradual increase in insulin release. In contrast, it lowered [Ca(2+)]i with a nadir at 2-3 min followed by a gradual increase in [Ca\u00b2\u207a]i. The glucose effect was mimicked by 20 mM \u03b1-ketoisocaproic acid, a mitochondrial fuel, and it was nullified by 2 mM sodium azide, an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport. Cerulenin, an inhibitor of protein acylation, decreased the glucose effect. In conclusion, a rise in [Ca\u00b2\u207a]i through voltage-dependent Ca\u00b2\u207a channels is not mandatory for glucose-induced triggering of insulin release.", 
    "70": "The purpose of this study was to investigate labetalol as a potential high permeability reference standard for the application of Biopharmaceutics Classification Systems (BCS). Permeabilities of labetalol and metoprolol were investigated in animal intestinal perfusion models and Caco-2 cell monolayers. After isolating specific intestinal segments, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusions (SPIP) were performed in rats and mice. The effective permeabilities (Peff) of labetalol and metoprolol, an FDA standard for the low/high Peff class boundary, were investigated in two different segments of rat intestine (proximal jejunum and distal ileum) and in the proximal jejunum of mouse. No significant difference was found between Peff of metoprolol and labetalol in the jejunum and ileum of rat (0.33 \u00b1 0.11 \u00d7 10(-4) vs 0.38 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10(-4) and 0.57 \u00b1 0.17 \u00d7 10(-4) vs 0.64 \u00b1 0.30 \u00d7 10(-4) cm/s, respectively) and in the jejunum of mouse (0.55 \u00b1 0.05 \u00d7 10(-4) vs 0.59 \u00b1 0.13 \u00d7 10(-4) cm/s). However, Peff of metoprolol and labetalol were 1.7 and 1.6 times higher in the jejunum of mouse, compared to the jejunum of rat, respectively. Metoprolol and labetalol showed segmental-dependent permeability through the rat intestine, with increased Peff in the distal ileum in comparison to the proximal jejunum. Most significantly, Peff of labetalol was found to be concentration-dependent. Decreasing concentrations of labetalol in the perfusate resulted in decreased Peff compared to Peff of metoprolol. The intestinal epithelial permeability of labetalol was lower than that of metoprolol in Caco-2 cells at both apical pH 6.5 and 7.5 (5.96 \u00b1 1.96 \u00d7 10(-6) vs 9.44 \u00b1 3.44 \u00d7 10(-6) and 15.9 \u00b1 2.2 \u00d7 10(-6) vs 23.2 \u00b1 7.1 \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s, respectively).

The P-gp inhibitor, verapamil, significantly increased AP-BL and decreased BL-AP direction transport of labetalol. Overall, labetalol showed high Peff in rat and mouse intestinal perfusion models similar to metoprolol at a concentration based on HDS. However, the concentration-dependent permeability of labetalol in mice due to P-gp and the inhibition study with verapamil in Caco-2 cells indicated that labetalol is not an ideal reference standard for BCS classification.",

Disruption of these learned associations would therefore limit relapse susceptibility. Drug-associated memories are susceptible to long-term disruption during retrieval and shortly after, during memory reconsolidation. Recent evidence reveals that retrieval and reconsolidation are dependent on \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2-AR) activation. Despite this, whether retrieval and reconsolidation are dependent on identical or distinct neural mechanisms is unknown. The prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PL-mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) have been implicated in the expression and reconsolidation of associative memories. Therefore, we investigated the necessity of \u03b2-AR activation within the PL-mPFC and BLA for cocaine-associated memory retrieval and reconsolidation in rats. Before or immediately after a cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) retrieval trial, \u03b2-AR antagonists were infused into the PL-mPFC or BLA, followed by daily testing. PL-mPFC infusions before, but not after, a CPP trial disrupted CPP memory retrieval and induced a persistent deficit in retrieval during subsequent trials. In contrast, BLA \u03b2-AR blockade had no effect on initial CPP memory retrieval, but prevented CPP expression during subsequent trials indicative of reconsolidation disruption. Our results reveal a distinct dissociation between the neural mechanisms required for cocaine-associated memory retrieval and reconsolidation. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we also show that application of a \u03b2-AR antagonist prevents norepinephrine-induced potentiation of PL-mPFC pyramidal cell and \u03b3-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) interneuron excitability.

    "97": "Recent studies have shown that osteoblasts and osteoclasts express \u03b22-adrenoceptor, and increased sympathetic nervous activity causes bone loss via an increase in osteoclastic bone resorption and a decrease in osteoblastic bone formation. We previously demonstrated that non-selective \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol at low doses (0.1 and 1mg/kg), but not at a higher dose (10mg/kg), prevented a decrease in bone mass and an increase in bone fragility in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), an animal model of osteoporosis with hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, without affecting blood pressure. In the present study, the dose effects of butoxamine, a selective \u03b22-adrenoceptor antagonist, on bone metabolism were examined in SHR by analysis of microcomputed tomography, bone histomorphometry, biomechanical testing and plasma biochemistry. Treatment of SHR with butoxamine at 0.1, 1 and 10mg/kg (per os) for 12 weeks increased bone mass indices and biomechanical parameters of strength and toughness of the lumbar vertebrae, suggesting antiosteoporotic activity. Butoxamine dose-dependently decreased osteoclast number and surface per bone surface with decreases in plasma tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b level, a biochemical index of osteoclastic activity.

Here, we show that 20-O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)-protopanaxadiol (20-GPPD), a metabolite of ginseng saponin, causes apoptosis of colon cancer cells through the induction of cytoplasmic Ca(2+). 20-GPPD decreased cell viability, increased annexin V-positive early apoptosis and induced sub-G1 accumulation and nuclear condensation of CT-26 murine colon cancer cells. Although 20-GPPD-induced activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) played a key role in the apoptotic death of CT-26 cells, LKB1, a well-known upstream kinase of AMPK, was not involved in this activation. To identify the upstream target of 20-GPPD for activating AMPK, we examined the effect of Ca(2+) on apoptosis of CT-26 cells. A calcium chelator recovered 20-GPPD-induced AMPK phosphorylation and CT-26 cell death. Confocal microscopy showed that 20-GPPD increased Ca(2+) entry into CT-26 cells, whereas a transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) blocker suppressed Ca(2+) entry. When cells were treated with a TRPC blocker plus an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium blocker, 20-GPPD-induced calcium influx was completely inhibited, suggesting that the ER calcium store, as well as TRPC, was involved. In vivo mouse CT-26 allografts showed that 20-GPPD significantly suppressed tumor growth, volume and weight in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, 20-GPPD exerts potent anticarcinogenic effects on colon carcinogenesis by increasing Ca(2+) influx, mainly through TRPC channels, and by targeting AMPK.", 
    "104": "The objective of the present investigation was to study the applicability of thermal sintering technique for the development of gastric floating tablets of propranolol HCl. Formulations were prepared using four independent variables, namely (i) polymer quantity, (ii) sodium bicarbonate concentration, (iii) sintering temperature and (iv) sintering time. Floating lag time and t95 were taken as dependent variables. Tablets were prepared by the direct compression method and were evaluated for physicochemical properties, in vitro buoyancy and dissolution studies. From the drug release studies, it was observed that drug retarding property mainly depends upon the sintering temperature and time of exposure. The statistically optimized formulation (PTSso) was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies, and no significant chemical interaction between drug and polymer was observed. Optimized formulation was stable at accelerated conditions for a period of six months. PTSso was evaluated for in vivo buoyancy studies in humans for both fed and fasted states and found that gastric residence time of the floating tablets were enhanced by fed stage but not in fasted state. Optimized formulation PTSso and commercial formulation Ciplar LA 80 were subjected to bioavailability studies in healthy human volunteers by estimating pharmacokinetic parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, area under curve (AUC), elimination rate constant (Kel), biological half-life (t1/2) and mean residence time (MRT). There was a significant increase in the bioavailability of the propranolol HCl from PTSso formulation, which was evident from increased AUC levels and larger MRT values than Ciplar LA 80.", 
    "105": "Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are benign tumors of endothelial-like cells. Occurring in 4.5% of children, they are the most common tumor of childhood. The great majority of patients with IH will not need treatment, but 10% require systemic treatment. Many treatments have been described for the treatment of IH, but the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any. Over the last decade, numerous reports of successful treatment of IH with propranolol have been published. Despite its widespread use, little is known regarding the proper dosing, safety monitoring, and during of treatment or long-term outcomes for propranolol treatment of IH. Given its potential side effects, detailed education regarding proper administration of the medication as well as warning signs to watch for is necessary for parents and caretakers. Herein, we provide a parental handout that practitioners can individually tailor for use in their clinics when educating parents and caretakers about the use of propranolol for IH. Updates will also need to be made as more is learned regarding the optimal dosing and safety monitoring when using propranolol for this indication.", 
    "106": "A significant increase in cardiovascular medication use during pregnancy occurred in recent years. Only limited evidence on safety profiles is available, and little is known about the mechanisms of adverse effect on the fetus. We hypothesized that drug-induced bradycardia is the leading mechanism of developmental toxicity. Embryotoxicity was tested in ovo after administration of various doses of metoprolol, carvedilol, or ivabradine. Embryonic day (ED) 4 and 8 chick embryos were studied by video microscopy and ultrasound biomicroscopy ex ovo after intraamniotic injection of the drug for a period of 30 min. Stroke volume was calculated by the Simpson method and prolate ellipsoid formula. Significant dose-dependent mortality was achieved in embryos injected with carvedilol and ivabradine. In ED4 embryos, metoprolol, carvedilol, and ivabradine reduced the heart rate by 33%, 27%, and 55%, respectively, compared with controls (6%). In ED8 embryos this effect was more pronounced with a heart rate reduction by 71%, 54%, and 53%, respectively (controls, 36%). Cardiac output decreased in all tested groups but only proved significant in the metoprolol group in ED8 embryos. The number of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors showed a downward tendency during embryonic development. A negative chronotropic effect of metoprolol, carvedilol, and ivabradine was increasingly pronounced with embryonic maturity despite a downward trend in the number of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. This effect was associated with reduced cardiac output in chick embryos, probably leading to premature death. Although standard doses of these drugs appear relatively safe, high doses have a potentially adverse effect on the fetus through reduced heart rate.",

Patients in sinus rhythm who received a \u03b2-blocker and who performed with maximal effort on the exercise test were included. Chronotropic index was calculated as an index of HR reserve achieved, by using the equation (220-age) for estimating maximum HR. A sensitivity analysis using an equation developed for HF patients on \u03b2-blockers was also performed. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to assess the association between CI and clinical outcomes. Median (25th, 75th percentiles) follow-up was 32 (21, 44) months. In a multivariable model including resting HR and CI as continuous variables, neither was associated with the primary outcome of all-cause mortality or hospitalization. However, each 0.1 unit decrease in CI <0.6 was associated with 17% increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.36; P = 0.036), and 13% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 1.13, 1.02-1.26; P = 0.025).

This case reviews a woman with familial LVNC (EF 45%, NYHA class I, evidence of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia pre-pregnancy) who had significant decompensation with heart failure in the third trimester that required early delivery. Deterioration in symptoms and LV function 7 days after delivery required further hospitalization and aggressive treatment. Suppression of lactation with bromocriptine, together with standard heart failure management, has allowed recovery and return to full activities and work. Acknowledged adverse risk factors in LVNC are considered, and pre-pregnancy risk assessment is reviewed. There is no specific treatment for LVNC in pregnancy besides the usual management of dilated cardiomyopathy. This is the ninth case report of LVNC in pregnancy reported in the literature.", 
    "111": "Chronic treatment with \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (\u03b2AR) agonists increases mortality and morbidity while \u03b2AR antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) decrease all-cause mortality for those at risk of cardiac disease. Levels of sympathetic nervous system \u03b2AR agonists and \u03b2AR activity increase with age, and this increase may hasten the development of age-related mortality. Here, we show that \u03b2-blockers extend the life span of healthy metazoans. The \u03b2-blockers metoprolol and nebivolol, administered in food daily beginning at 12 months of age, significantly increase the mean and median life span of isocalorically fed, male C3B6F1 mice, by 10 and 6.4%, respectively (P < 0.05). Neither drug affected the weight or food intake of the mice, indicating that induced CR is not responsible for these effects, and that energy absorption and utilization are not altered by the drugs. Both \u03b2-blockers were investigated to control for their idiosyncratic, off-target effects. Metoprolol and nebivolol extended Drosophila life span, without affecting food intake or locomotion. Thus, \u03b2AR antagonists are capable of directly extending the life span of two widely divergent metazoans, suggesting that these effects are phylogenetically highly conserved. Thus, long-term use of \u03b2-blockers, which are generally well-tolerated, may enhance the longevity of healthy humans.", 
    "112": "The ability of anionic polymer sodium carboxymethylcellulose to influence the release of four model cationic drugs (chlorpheniramine maleate, venlafaxine hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride and verapamil hydrochloride) from extended release (ER) hydrophilic matrices based on non-ionic polymer polyethylene oxide was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For all studied APIs, a combination of polyethylene oxide with sodium carboxymethylcellulose produced slower drug release compared to the matrices of single polymers. This behaviour was mainly attributed to the interaction of ester/carboxylic acid functionalities to yield H-bonding between the anionic polymer groups and the additionally protonated N-atoms of the active substances. X-ray photoelectron and isothermal titration calorimetry studies confirmed drug-polymer interaction and polymer-polymer interaction (i.e. the PEO binding with negatively charged NaCMC), whilst differential scanning calorimetry indicated the existence of both crystalline and molecularly dispersed active forms in the created complexes. The drug release mechanisms were fitted to various models suggesting diffusion control for the majority of the formulations. The Korsmeyer-Peppas model was found to be the most suitable for description of release profiles of all formulations. The present study showed that XPS and ITC in combination with DSC can be valuable tool to investigate the presence and nature (mechanism) of synergistic interactions between polymers and drugs in extended release matrix tablets.",

We conducted a literature review to describe each myth's origins and the quality of supporting evidence.", 
    "115": "All patients with allergies, including but not limited to seafood allergies, are at an increased risk for anaphylactoid reactions to radiocontrast. No conclusive studies indicate that patients with atrial fibrillation of less than 48 hours' duration do not require anticoagulation before cardioversion. A CT scan before lumbar puncture in suspected acute bacterial meningitis is a clinically inefficient precaution. \u03b2-blockers can be safely used in patients with respiratory disease and may even prevent cardiac events in these patients.", 
    "116": "These familiar myths have maintained prominent roles in medical thinking because they represent wisdom passed down from eminent sources, they teach physiology and medical skills, and they offer physicians a sense of control in the face of uncertainty. In addition to providing scientific evidence, changing physicians' practice requires acknowledging that even meticulous care cannot always avert bad outcomes.", 
    "117": "Fluorescent and colorimetric reporter genes are valuable tools for drug screening models, since microscopy is labor intensive and subject to observer variation. In this work, we propose a fluorimetric method for drug screening using red fluorescent parasites. Fluorescent Leishmania amazonensis were developed after transfection with integration plasmids containing either red (RFP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes. After transfection, wild-type (LaWT) and transfected (LaGFP and LaRFP) parasites were subjected to flow cytometry, macrophage infection, and tests of susceptibility to current antileishmanial agents and propranolol derivatives previously shown to be active against Trypanosoma cruzi. Flow cytometry analysis discriminated LaWT from LaRFP and LaGFP parasites, without affecting cell size or granulosity. With microscopy, transfection with antibiotic resistant genes was not shown to affect macrophage infectivity and susceptibility to amphotericin B and propranolol derivatives. Retention of fluorescence remained in the intracellular amastigotes in both LaGFP and LaRFP transfectants. However, detection of intracellular RFP parasites was only achieved in the fluorimeter. Murine BALB/c macrophages were infected with LaRFP parasites, exposed to standard (meglumine antimoniate, amphotericin B, Miltefosine, and allopurinol) and tested molecules. Although it was possible to determine IC(50) values for 4 propranolol derivatives (1, 2b, 3, and 4b), all compounds were considered inactive. This study is the first to develop a fluorimetric drug screening test for L. amazonensis RFP. The fluorimetric test was comparable to microscopy with the advantage of being faster and not requiring manual counting.",

The aligned electrospun UTLC plates (AE-UTLC) were characterized to give an optimized electrospun mat consisting of high nanofiber alignment and a mat thickness of ~25 \u03bcm. The AE-UTLC devices were used to separate a mixture of \u03b2-blockers and steroidal compounds to illustrate the properties of AE-UTLC. The AE-UTLC plates provided shorter analysis time (~2-2.5 times faster) with improved reproducibility (as high as 2 times) as well as an improvement in efficiency (up to100 times greater) relative to non-aligned electrospun-UTLC (E-UTLC) devices.", 
    "119": "The development of comprehensive methods able to tackle with the systematic identification of drug metabolites in an automated fashion is of great interest. In this article, a strategy based on the combined use of two complementary data mining tools is proposed for the screening and systematic detection and identification of urinary drug metabolites by liquid chromatography full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry. The proposed methodology is based on the use of accurate mass extraction of diagnostic ions (compound-dependent information) from in-source CID fragmentation without precursor ion isolation along with the use of automated mass extraction of accurate-mass shifts corresponding to typical biotransformations (non compound-dependent information) that xenobiotics usually undergo when metabolized. The combined strategy was evaluated using LC-TOFMS with a suite of nine sport drugs representative from different classes (propranolol, bumetanide, clenbuterol, ephedrine, finasteride, methoxyphenamine, methylephedrine, salbutamol and terbutaline), after single doses administered to rats. The metabolite identification coverage rate obtained with the systematic method (compared to existing literature) was satisfactory, and provided the identification of several non-previously reported metabolites. In addition, the combined information obtained helps to minimize the number of false positives. As an example, the systematic identification of urinary metabolites of propranolol enabled the identification of up to 24 metabolites, 15 of them non previously described in literature, which is a valuable indicator of the usefulness of the proposed systematic procedure.", 
    "120": "Carvedilol has beneficial effects on cardiac function in patients with heart failure but its effect on ovariectomy-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction remains unclear. Estrogen deficiency induces myocardial contractile dysfunction and increases cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. Our aim was to investigate whether carvedilol, a beta receptor blocker, would prevent ovariectomy-induced myocardial contractile dysfunction. Female rats (8 weeks old) that underwent bilateral ovariectomy were randomly assigned to receive daily treatment with carvedilol (OVX+CAR, 20 mg/kg), placebo (OVX) and SHAM for 58 days. Left ventricle papillary muscle was mounted for isometric tension recordings. The inotropic response to Ca(2+) (0.62 to 3.75 mM) and isoproterenol (Iso 10(-8) to 10(-2 )M) were assessed. Expression of calcium handling proteins was measured by western blot analysis. Carvedilol treatment in the OVX animals: prevented weight gain and slight hypertrophy, restored the reduced positive inotropic responses to Ca(2+) and isoproterenol, prevented the reduction in SERCA2a expression, abolished the increase in superoxide anion production, normalized the increase in p22(phox) expression, and decreased serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. This study demonstrated that myocardial contractile dysfunction and SERCA2a down regulation were prevented by carvedilol treatment. Superoxide anion production and NADPH oxidase seem to be involved in this response.",

The effect of ROCK inhibition on the vasodilation of porcine conjunctival vasculature was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunohistochemical staining with subsequent laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Experiments were conducted in New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits to assess the effect of ROCK inhibition on the intraocular distribution of timolol maleate.", 
    "123": "ROCK inhibition resulted in minimal alteration of ex vivo porcine corneal drug penetration of timolol, sotalol, or brinzolamide. SEM and LSCM experiments conducted with conjunctiva and sclera tissue in Franz diffusion cells suggested vasodilation in the conjunctival vasculature in the presence of Y-27632. Pretreatment of the eyes of NZW rabbits with Y-27632 resulted in aggregate fold reductions (1 hour, 0.25-fold; 4 hours, 0.45-fold) of timolol maleate drug concentrations in intraocular tissues (aqueous humor, lens, and iris) versus eyes not receiving Y-27632 pretreatment. Pretreatment with a vasoconstrictor, phenylephrine, resulted in a reversal of the effect of Y-27632 on diminished timolol maleate intraocular penetration in NZW rabbits.",

    "125": "Dose-response analysis is one of the accepted efficacy endpoints to establish effectiveness. The purpose of this research was to inform selection of an appropriate pre-specified primary dose-response analysis to demonstrate drug efficacy in a registration trial. The power and the type I error rate of the placebo-corrected (i.e., simply adjusting the observed treatment value by subtracting the placebo mean) and the placebo-anchored (i.e., including the placebo data as dose 0 in the regression) slope analyses were assessed based on regulatory submission data for two antihypertensive drugs and simulated data from hypothetical clinical trials. In the simulated hypothetical trials, the impact of different dosing strategies (i.e., the fixed dose versus the weight-based per kilogram dose), sample size, and scenarios governing the drug exposure-response relationship (e.g., E(max), ED(50), and SD) was also evaluated. For each scenario, a total 300 replications were simulated. The placebo-anchored slope analysis is always more powerful to demonstrate effectiveness in all plausible scenarios. The difference between the placebo-anchored and the placebo-corrected analyses was maximum when the studied doses were too high. However, the dose-response analysis is not sensitive to the dosing strategies. Furthermore, the type I error rate of these two methods was also found to be comparable. The design of dose-response studies should carefully consider these results to justify the inclusion of placebo and the analysis method. The pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory agencies are equally responsible for using the appropriate methods of primary analysis and providing justification in the protocol.",

The rate law for the oxidation of PPL by Fe(VI) was first-order with respect to each reactant. The dependence of second-order rate constants of the reaction of Fe(VI) and PPL on pH was explained using acid-base equilibrium of Fe(VI) and PPL. The required molar stoichiometry for the complete removal of PPL was determined to be 6:1 ([Fe(VI)]:[PPL]). The identified products using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were oxidized product (OP)-292, OP-308, and OP-282. The formed OPs could possibly compete with the parent molecule to react with Fe(VI) and thus resulted in a non-linear relationship between degradation of PPL and the added amount of Fe(VI).

Additionally, carvedilol significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with \u03b2(1)-selective BBs in AMI patients using the fixed-effects model but not using the random-effects model.", 
    "202": "In this work, a new macroporous molecularly imprinted cryogel (MIP composite cryogel) was synthesized by glutaraldehyde cross-linking reaction of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) particles and amino-modified molecularly imprinted core-shell nanoparticles. The MIP core-shell nanoparticles were prepared using propranolol as a template by one-pot precipitation polymerization with sequential monomer addition. The characteristics of the MIP composite cryogel were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and texture analyzer. The macroporous structure of the composite (with the pore size varying from a few micrometers to 100 \u03bcm) enabled high mass transfer of particulate-containing fluids. In a solid phase extraction (SPE) process, the efficiency and selectivity of the MIP composite cryogel were investigated, where the cryogel was used as an affinity matrix to remove propranolol from aqueous solution as well as from complex plasma sample without prior protein precipitation. The MIP composite cryogel maintained high selectivity and stability and could be used repeatedly after regeneration."
