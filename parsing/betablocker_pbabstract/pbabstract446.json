In this paradigm, unmedicated rats 'gate', i.e. suppress the response to the second of a pair of clicks delivered at a 0.5 s interval. Amphetamine-treated rats fail to gate; in this respect, they resemble schizophrenic humans. Previous studies had indicated noradrenergic involvement in the mediation of auditory gating in rats. In this study, we used selective antagonists to assess the contribution of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, and dopamine D1- and D2-receptors, to amphetamine-induced alterations in gating. Both the alpha-antagonist, phentolamine, and the beta-antagonist, timolol, normalized gating by potentiating amphetamine-induced decreases in the amplitude of the test response. SCH 23390, a D1-receptor antagonist, also normalized gating, but by elevating the amphetamine-reduced amplitude of the conditioning response. Sulpiride did not significantly alter amphetamine-induced changes in gating. Thus, both noradrenergic alpha- and beta-receptors and dopamine D1-receptors appear to modulate gating. However, their dissimilar means of normalizing gating suggests that noradrenergic and dopaminergic drugs act via different mechanisms and possibly different neuroanatomical loci.", 
    "1": "1-Isoproterenol has equal affinity for beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors and is a full agonist at both subtypes. However, when infused in vivo into the rat brain, it has been shown to induce a preferential reduction of central beta 2-adrenoceptors. To investigate this phenomenon further, in the present study rats were infused centrally with higher doses of 1-isoproterenol (15 or 45 micrograms/h). Furthermore, isoproterenol was infused into rats lesioned neonatally with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Subtypes of beta-adrenoceptors were measured by quantitative autoradiography of the binding of [125I]iodopindolol ([125I]IPIN). In sham lesioned rats, infusions of isoproterenol at both doses caused comparable reductions in the density of [125I]IPIN binding sites in many brain regions. The binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors was decreased in a larger number of brain areas than the binding to beta 1-adrenoceptors and the magnitude of the reduction was greater for beta 2- than for beta 1-adrenoceptors. However, isoproterenol at these doses did produce greater effects on the beta 1-subtype than those found previously with a lower dose. Treatment with 6-OHDA induced significant increases in the binding of [125I]IPIN to both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in cerebral cortical and hippocampal areas, indicating that endogenous norepinephrine may regulate both subtypes in these regions. Even in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, the binding of [125I]IPIN to beta 2-adrenoceptors was reduced to a greater extent that the binding to beta 1-adrenoceptors. Thus, these studies demonstrate that the non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induces a preferential regulation of beta 2-adrenoceptors, even at relatively high doses and in norepinephrine-depleted animals.", 
    "2": "It has been proposed that beta-blockers and agents affecting Ca2+ metabolism might exert cardioprotective actions because of their ability to act as antioxidants in vivo. The feasibility of this proposal was tested by examining the reaction of a series of such compounds with various oxygen-derived species. None of the compounds tested was sufficiently reactive with superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide or hypochlorous acid for scavenging of these species to be feasible in vivo at the drug concentrations present in patients given the usual therapeutic doses. All the drugs tested were powerful scavengers of hydroxyl radical except for flunarizine, which stimulated iron ion-dependent hydroxyl radical generation from hydrogen peroxide. However, none of the drugs significantly inhibited production of hydroxyl radicals in this system. Propranolol, verapamil and flunarizine had significant inhibitory effects on the peroxidation of rat liver microsomes in the presence of iron ions and ascorbic acid. All three compounds exerted weaker inhibitory effects on peroxidation of arachidonic acid caused by a mixture of myoglobin and H2O2: pindolol stimulated peroxidation in this system. It is concluded that the ability of beta-blockers and \"Ca(2+)-blockers\" to inhibit lipid peroxidation varies with the lipid substrate used and the mechanism by which peroxidation is induced. We conclude that suggestions that beta-blockers and \"Ca(2+)-blockers\" exert antioxidant effects in vivo are not well founded, although there is a possibility that verapamil and propranolol might have some inhibitory effects against peroxidation if they accumulate in membranes to a sufficiently-high concentration in vivo. We could not confirm the reported ability of propranolol to inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase.", 
    "3": "The effects of (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), a selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist, on nerve conduction in the isolated frog sciatic nerve trunk were examined. Compound action potential amplitude was concentration dependently decreased by (+/-)-DOI (EC50 = 1.2 mM), an effect that was not altered by the presence of ketanserin and with a similar potency to lignocaine. (+/-)-propranolol and disopyramide. The results indicate that (+/-)-DOI has membrane stabilising properties, in addition to its reported 5-HT2 agonist actions.", 
    "4": "Insulin-induced drinking (IID) in male Wistar rats, evoked by administering 5 U/kg of crystalline porcine insulin i.p., was significantly decreased by propranolol (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg s.c.) after 1 and 2 h. The blood glucose of rats treated with a much higher dose of propranolol (10 mg/kg body weight) and insulin did not differ from that of rats treated solely with insulin after 30 and 120 min. Atenolol (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) caused a reduction in IID after 1 and 2h. Butoxamine (1 mg/kg s.c.) also reduced IID after 1 and 2h, and at 0.5 mg/kg after 1h. The alpha-blocker, phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg s.c.), had the opposite effect, stimulating IID after 2h. There is no direct evidence that insulin activated the sympathetic system at the doses used in these experiments. Nevertheless, the results reported here seem to be compatible with the involvement of the sympathetic system in IID, possible through the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "5": "Using microdialysis, changes in extraneuronal levels of dopamine (DA), and the metabolites of DA and serotonin (5-HT), were monitored concurrent with perfusion of 5-HT1 agonists into the anterior striata of anesthetized rats. Perfusion of 5-HT facilitated DA release in a dose dependent manner, and to a greater extent than any other agonist tested. Extraneuronal DA levels increased 34% with perfusion of 0.04 nmol 5-HT and 18-fold with perfusion of 4.0 nmol 5-HT. Perfusion with multiple doses of either 1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP) or trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) also resulted in a dose-dependent facilitation of DA release with a 40% increase in extracellular DA produced by either 0.4 nmol m-CPP or 10.0 nmol TFMPP. A 50-fold increase in DA followed 40.0 nmol m-CPP, while 160 nmol TFMPP enhanced DA 11-fold. Local application of either 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H indole succinate (RU24969) or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) (2.0 nmol perfused over 20 min) increased extracellular DA by 300 and 40%, respectively. RU24969 (2.0 nmol) also facilitated DA release following systemic pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT (100 micrograms/kg). Perfusion with fenfluramine to release endogenous 5-HT also increased extraneuronal DA in a dose-dependent manner, and this facilitation was prevented by pretreatment with the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. The facilitation of DA release by 0.4 nmol 5-HT was reduced by pretreatment with the 5-HT1 antagonist pindolol (4.0 nmol). These results suggest that serotonergic innervation of the anterior striatum may exert a facilitatory influence on DA release.", 
    "6": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of acupuncture on the immunological response. The induction of anti-sheep red blood cells (SRBC) plaque-forming cells (PFC) was used as a measurement of the immune response to treatment. In normal non-immunized mice, enhancement of PFC was seen after a single acupuncture treatment when spleen cells from stimulated mice were cultured with SRBC in vitro. After 3 acupuncture treatments, spleen cells from mice did not show PFC enhancement after treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 antibody and complement, nor after the removal of non-adherent cells. Serum obtained from mice 1 h after acupuncture stimulation enhanced the PFC of normal spleen cells in vitro, but the enhancement was abolished by the addition of propranolol. These results suggest that acupuncture, by activation of the autonomic nervous system, modulates the immune response.", 
    "7": "The effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and a related analog, CNK-602A, that induces the release of catecholamines, on long-term potentiation (LTP) of the population spike in mossy fiber-CA3 pathways were investigated in guinea pig hippocampal slices. TRH augmented LTP of the population spike at concentrations of 10(-6)-10(-5) M. CNK-602A also augmented LTP at concentrations of 10(-6)-10(-5) M in a dose-dependent manner. LTP in slices of the hippocampus obtained from animals given 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) intraventricularly was significantly lower than that in non-treated animals. However, both TRH and CNK-602A (10(-6) M) augmented LTP in slices from 6-OHDA-treated animals. These findings suggest that TRH and CNK-602A augment LTP in the mossy fiber-CA3 pathway without activating noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic fibers.", 
    "8": "Lindane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide, was previously shown to enhance the nighttime rise in pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin as well as serum melatonin levels. The purpose of the present study was to test whether lindane acts on the pineal gland by means of a beta-adrenergic receptor mechanism. Whereas lindane (total dose 17.8 mg/kg b.wt. over 6 days) by itself significantly augmented the nocturnal levels of pineal NAT activity in otherwise untreated rats, the pesticide was ineffective in reference to this enzyme when it was given in conjunction with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (20 mg/kg b.wt., one hour before lights off). The augmentation of NAT activity by lindane also caused significant reductions in pineal serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA); again, both these responses were blocked by propranolol treatment. Neither pineal 5-hydroxytryptophan nor pineal or serum melatonin levels were significantly changed as a result of either lindane or propranolol treatment. The results are consistent with the idea that lindane influences pineal 5-HT metabolism either at the level of the beta-adrenergic receptor or via the sympathetic innervation to the pineal gland.", 
    "9": "A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of the enantiomers of atenolol in rat plasma has been developed. Racemic atenolol and practolol (internal standard) were extracted from alkalinized plasma (pH 12) into dichloromethane containing 3% (v/v) heptafluoro-1-butanol, and the organic layer was evaporated. The samples were derivatized with (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate at pH 8.5 for 30 min. After removal of excess reagent, the diastereomers were extracted into dichloromethane. The diastereomers were separated on a Microspher C18 column (3 microns) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-sodium acetate buffer (0.01 M, pH 7) (50:50, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.8 ml/min. Fluorescence detection (lambda ex = 227 nm, lambda em = 310 nm) was used. When 100 microliters of plasma were used, the quantitation limit was 10 ng/ml for the atenolol enantiomers. The assay was applied to measure concentrations of atenolol enantiomers in plasma after intravenous administration of racemic atenolol to rats.", 
    "10": "Using membrane fractions (MF) from guinea pig alveolar macrophages (AM), we investigated the effects of sensitization and antigen challenge on the stepwise activation of adenylyl cyclase considering receptor binding, G-protein coupling and direct stimulation of the enzyme. Receptor binding studies, using [125I]ICYP as the beta-adrenoceptor specific ligand, show that neither receptor number (Bmax) nor receptor affinity constants (Kd values) were affected by sensitization or antigen challenge. Using forskolin as a direct stimulant of AC, alterations in the enzymatic activity of AC could be excluded. Pretreatment of the different MF with cholera toxin (CT, a toxin which eliminates GTPase activity) and subsequent stimulation of AC with GTP, shows an increased responsiveness in MF from sensitized and antigen challenged AM. In addition, pretreatment of MF from naive AM with increasing doses of CT results in a maximal AC response at the higher concentrations used (50-100 micrograms/mL), an effect not observed in MF from sensitized and antigen challenged AM. In these MF, the AC response still increases after pretreatment with such doses of CT. These data suggest that the enhanced AC responsiveness in AM, induced by sensitization and antigen challenge, results from alterations in alpha s-subunits.", 
    "11": "In a three-month, double-masked, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the once-daily ocular hypotensive efficacy of 0.25% levobunolol and 0.25% timolol in 80 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Thirty-seven of the 39 patients (95%) in the 0.25% levobunolol group and 35 of the 41 patients (85%) in the 0.25% timolol group successfully completed the three-month study period. The overall mean decrease in intraocular pressure was 5.3 mm Hg (22%) in the 0.25% levobunolol group and 5.4 mm Hg (22%) in the 0.25% timolol group. This difference was not statistically significant. In both treatment groups, effects on mean heart rate and blood pressure were minimal. The data suggest that levobunolol 0.25% and timolol 0.25%, administered once daily, are equally effective in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.", 
    "12": "Effects of acute and chronic treatment with propranolol on oxidative phosphorylation in rat heart mitochondria were examined. Acute propranolol treatment resulted in inhibition of coupled respiration with pyruvate + malate and succinate as substrates. Chronic treatment resulted in decreased state 3 respiration rates with all the substrates employed. The net effect of propranolol treatment was decreased ATP-phosphorylation rates suggesting that this was possibly one of the modes of its cardiodepressant activity. Additionally, chronic propranolol treatment brought about a decrease in the content of cytochrome c + c1 in heart mitochondria. Estimation of propranolol concentrations in serum, whole tissue homogenate and heart mitochondria indicated that although the mitochondria accumulated the highest amount of the drug, the intramitochondrial concentration of the drug was one or two orders of magnitude lower than that which is required to bring about inhibition of respiration under in vitro conditions. Besides, the concentrations reached under acute and chronic treatment conditions were almost comparable. The results, therefore, suggest that the action of the drug in vivo may involve more intricate mechanisms than those observed under in vitro conditions.", 
    "13": "To determine the diurnal pattern of cardiac autonomic tone in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), this study examined the power spectrum of heart rate (HR) variability in 24 patients during a single 24-hour segment within 4 days of AMI. Patients were nonrandomly allocated to a group (n = 14) without autonomic drugs and to a group (n = 10) already receiving beta blockers at the time of AMI. With use of autoregressive modeling, the power spectrum of HR variability was computed from continuous 1-hour electrocardiographic segments recorded at equally spaced intervals; 7 to 8 A.M., 3 to 4 P.M., and 11 to 12 P.M. All patients were supine, awake and pain free during recordings. There were no differences in HR, HR variance or the low-frequency peak power (0.06 to 0.1 Hz) from one temporal sequence to another. For the patients not taking beta blockers, the high-frequency peak power (0.2 to 0.36 Hz) or vagal component increased significantly from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. (28 +/- 11 to 45 +/- 20 beats/min2.Hz-1, p less than 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the low- to high-frequency peak power and area ratios from 3 P.M. to 11 P.M. All power spectral parameters in the patients taking beta blockers remained unchanged over 24 hours. There was significantly heightened vagal modulation of sinus node activity in those receiving beta blockers, especially at 7 A.M. and 3 P.M. The data suggest that under steady-state wakeful conditions in the early recovery phase after an AMI, vagal tone is more pronounced during the late evening hours with a possible shift to relative sympathetic dominance during early morning and midafternoon hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Previous studies have shown that long-term survival after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is improved by beta-adrenergic blockade and anterograde flow in the infarct artery. This study was done to assess the influence of beta blockade on mortality in survivors of AMI without anterograde flow. Over 9.5 years, 113 subjects (87 men and 26 women, aged 26 to 66 years) with AMI and no anterograde flow in the infarct artery and no disease of the other arteries were medically treated for 48 +/- 28 (mean +/- standard deviation) months. Forty-six patients received long-term beta blockade (group I), whereas 67 did not (group II). The groups were similar in age, sex, cardioactive medications, left ventricular performance and infarct artery. Of the 46 group I subjects, 1 (2%) died of cardiac causes; in contrast, 20 (30%) of the group II patients died of cardiac causes (p = 0.007 compared with group I). Thus, in survivors of AMI without anterograde flow in the infarct artery, mortality is markedly reduced by long-term beta blockade.", 
    "15": "Human platelets were loaded with the fluorescent Na(+)-sensitive dye sodium-binding benzofuran isophtalate (SBFI), and changes in the fluorescence excited at 345 and 385 nm were analyzed after manipulations that evoked predictable changes in the cytosolic Na+ concentration ([Na+]i). Raising [Na+]i by either gramicidin D or monensin specifically increased the fluorescence excited at 345 nm and decreased that excited at 385 nm. Hence, calculation of changes in the 345/385 nm excitation ratio yields an estimate of actual changes in [Na+]i. A transient activation of Na+/H+ exchange evoked by addition of acidified platelets to buffer, pH 7.4, evoked a transient rise in [Na+]i. The re-establishment of basal [Na+]i could be prevented by ouabain, indicating an involvement of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. Upon stimulation by 0.5 unit/ml of thrombin, [Na+]i immediately increased by 16 +/- 4 mM and this rise continued for at least 60 min after addition of agonist, albeit at a lower rate. This latter sustained rise could not be curtailed by scavenging thrombin by means of hirudin. Addition of ouabain or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induced a comparable slow rise in the 345/385 excitation ratio. This may indicate a protein kinase C-mediated inhibition by thrombin of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+o), the [Na+]i gain was augmented to 38 +/- 9 mM. This additional uptake of Na+ was prevented by (i) Mn2+ ions, (ii) La3+ ions, (iii) the blocker of receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry (1-[beta[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propoxyl]-4-methoxyphenethyl]-1H-im ida zole hydrochloride), and (iv) by hirudin which reversed receptor occupancy by thrombin. These findings suggest that the additional thrombin-induced [Na+]i gain in the absence of Ca2+o is due to Na+ influx through a Ca2+ entry pathway. The increase in [Na+]i in the presence of Ca2+o results from Na+ influx via Na+/H+ exchange.", 
    "16": "The ability of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline to inhibit agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism was examined in bovine tracheal smooth muscle slices prelabelled with [3H]inositol. Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was enhanced by the muscarinic agonists carbachol, oxotremorine and pilocarpine although the latter were only partial agonists for this response. Histamine stimulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was sensitive to mepyramine but maximal responses were only comparable to those of pilocarpine. Preincubation of tracheal slices with isoprenaline reduced the maximal phosphoinositide response to histamine and pilocarpine but the responses to carbachol and oxotremorine were unaffected. The inhibitory effect of isoprenaline (IC50 = 0.04 microM) was reversed competitively by 1 microM propranolol. The non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) (1 mM) resulted in a more severe suppression of the histamine and pilocarpine responses and also produced a significant suppression of the maximal response to oxotremorine and a small shift in the carbachol dose-response curve. The different susceptibility of agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis to isoprenaline and IBMX are discussed in relation to the relative intrinsic activity of the agonists and/or the role of different muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "17": "The effect of exogenously applied somatostatin (1-14), which is one of the candidates of neuromodulators in the hippocampus, on long-term potentiation (LTP) was investigated in the CA1 and CA3 subfields of guinea-pig hippocampal slices. In the mossy fiber-CA3 pyramidal cell system, the magnitude of LTP of both population excitatory postsynaptic potential (pEPSP) and population spike was significantly augmented by somatostatin (10(-7)-10(-6) M) perfused before and during tetanic stimulation which never affected basal amplitude of population spikes before tetanus. The enhancement of LTP by somatostatin lasted for at least one hour after washout. On the other hand, somatostatin at the most effective concentration (3.2 x 10(-7) M) in the above described system failed to affect the magnitude of the LTP of population spikes in Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. The enhancing effect of somatostatin on LTP in the mossy fiber CA3 system was inhibited either by a muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (10(-6) M), or a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, timolol (10(-6) M). These results suggest that somatostatin enhances the production of LTP in the mossy fiber-CA3 pathway of the guinea-pig hippocampus through the intervention of cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons.", 
    "18": "The effect of NZ-107 (4-bromo-5-(3-ethoxy-4-methoxybenzylamino)-3(2H)-pyridazinone) on late-phase airway responses and airway hyperreactivity was investigated in the guinea pig. Challenge with inhaled ovalbumin in conscious guinea pigs actively sensitized with inhaled ovalbumin caused triphasic bronchial obstruction, which peaked at 5-30 min, 6-8 h and 24 h. In this model, airway hyperreactivity to acetylcholine was observed 48 h after antigen challenge. Orally administered NZ-107, given 2 h before ovalbumin challenge significantly inhibited airway responses at 5-30 min (10 mg/kg), 6-8 h (30 mg/kg), 24 h (10 mg/kg) and airway hyperreactivity (30 mg/kg). When NZ-107 (10 mg/kg) was orally administered to the guinea pigs 3 h after ovalbumin challenge, it also inhibited airway responses at 6-8 h and 24 h and airway hyperreactivity. In anaesthetized guinea pigs, intravenous administration of NZ-107 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) inhibited platelet-activating factor (PAF)- and propranolol-induced airway hyperreactivity to histamine. These results suggest that NZ-107 may be a useful drug for the treatment of bronchial asthma by reducing late-phase airway responses and airway hyperreactivity.", 
    "19": "The nature of the beta-adrenoceptors (beta-ARs) of the white fat cells of five mammalian species (rat, hamster, rabbit, dog and humans) was reassessed. The coexistence of at least three beta-ARs on the fat cell (except human) was demonstrated. Comparative binding and lipolysis studies were performed, using recently synthesized compounds selective for the atypical beta-AR of the rat brown fat cell and of the rat colon. beta 1- and beta 2-ARs have previously been identified in all the mammalian white fat cells using [125I]cyanopindolol ([125]CYP) or [3H]dihydroalprenolol. In addition to these receptors, we now demonstrated the existence of a third beta-AR directly involved in adrenergic-mediated lipolysis, and identified it in the white fat cells of the most commonly studied animal species, except humans. This receptor is not detected by the classically used beta-antagonist radioligands, explaining the discrepancies in reports on the nature of the beta-ARs of the adipose tissue. Pharmacological delineation of the third type of beta-AR-induced lipolysis showed this receptor to be rather similar to the previously proposed atypical beta-AR of brown and white rat fat cells. Its pharmacological properties were clarified, using new selective full agonists and partial agonists also acting as non-selective beta 1/beta 2-antagonists. The limits of [125]CYP as a radioligand were reported and the usefulness of BRL 37344, (+/-)-CGP 12177 and phenylethanolaminotralines derivatives (having an atypical beta-activity on intestinal motility) as major tools usable for atypical beta-AR activation was demonstrated. Moreover, confirming our previous results about the nature of the beta-ARs (beta 1- and beta 2-ARs) located in the fat cells of women (Mauri\u00e8ge et al., J. Lipid Res., 1987, 17, 156), no atypical beta-AR-mediated lipolysis was identified in abdominal adipose tissue from healthy women. The possible differences and similarities between this receptor and the recently cloned beta 3-AR are discussed.", 
    "20": "The effect of the enantiomers of oxaprotiline on the sympathetic nervous system was studied in anesthetized rabbits. (+)-Oxaprotile 0.2, 0.6 and 1.8 mg kg-1 dose dependently reduced prostganglionic renal sympathetic nerve activity and the clearance of [3H]noradrenaline from the plasma but increased the plasma noradrenaline concentration. The spillover of noradrenaline into the blood was not changed significantly, nor were blood pressure and heart rate, except transiently. The same doses of (-)-oxaprotiline had no effect on any of the parameters measured. (+)-Oxoprotiline also reduced lumbar preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity. The effect of (+)-oxaprotiline on renal sympathetic nerve activity was only minimally antagonized by yohimbine given alone. (+)-Oxaprotiline also inhibited renal sympathetic nerve activity after treatment with prazosin and propranolol. Subsequent administration of yohimbine restored sympathetic nerve activity to the value seen before the administration of (+)-oxaprotiline. The results show that inhibition of the re-uptake of released noradrenaline is the basis of the sympathoinhibition produced by (+)-oxaprotiline. Noradrenaline probably acts on alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system to produce sympathoinhibition.", 
    "21": "The effect of methamphetamine on the expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA in the rat brain was investigated with Northern blot analysis. Methamphetamine (2-15 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a marked induction of IL-1 beta mRNA in the hypothalamus among the 8 brain regions examined, in a dose-dependent manner. The level of IL-1 beta mRNA reached a maximum at 1 h and rapidly declined within 2 h after the injection of 15 mg/kg. These results provide the first evidence that methamphetamine induces the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA in the hypothalamus, which may be partly involved in the production of central actions of this drug.", 
    "22": "The effect of amphiphilic cationic drugs on the channel activity of the mitochondrial inner membrane was examined with patch-clamp techniques. The therapeutic drugs amiodarone, propranolol and quinine reduced the probability of being open for the multiconductance channel (MCC) activity (levels from 30 pS to over 1 nS). While amiodarone decreased the probability of being open for the voltage dependent approximately 100 pS channel, it increased the conductance 42 +/- 20% (mean +/- SD, n = 6) with no significant change in mean open time. Similar results were obtained with propranolol. These data indicate that the approximately 100 pS channel is distinct from MCC activity.", 
    "23": "The purpose of this experiment was to determine in skin microvasculature the dose response to bradykinin (BRADY). Over a range 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 microgram/kg/min BRADY was infused into the femoral artery of anesthetized dogs while lymph was collected from the hind paw. After 4 hours of continuous BRADY, venous pressure was increased 20 to 30 mm Hg by tightening a tourniquet around the thigh to further increase lymph flow and achieve a filtration-independent lymph-plasma ratio, for albumin (R Alb), immunoglobulin G (R IgG), and immunoglobulin M (R IgM). These proteins were measured with immunoelectrophoresis and immunodiffusion. MEAN +/- SD, * p less than 0.05, ANOVA, DIFFERENT FROM LOWER DOSE. [Formula: see text] BRADY caused a dose-related increase in microvascular permeability up to 0.4 microgram/kg/min. The increase in the lymph-plasma ratio for the large plasma proteins (IgM, molecular radius 110 A) is of the same magnitude as for albumin, (molecular radius 36 A), and this suggests BRADY increased the number but not the size of \"large pores\" in the microvascular membrane.", 
    "24": "The stimulus parameters needed for the release of endogenous opioid peptides were investigated using an in vitro radioligand displacement assay in living guinea pig hippocampal slices. Electrical stimulation of the enkephalin-containing fibers in the perforant path caused the release of endogenous opioid peptides and the subsequent displacement of [3H]-[D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,glyol5]enkephalin binding. High frequency trains of stimuli (10 Hz for 1 sec every 10 sec) were more effective than lower frequency stimulation (1 Hz continuous) at evoking opioid peptide release. Having identified an effective stimulation paradigm able to release endogenous opioids, the electrophysiological effects of endogenous opioids on CA3 pyramidal cells were measured in the guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation. Unlike exogenously applied opioids, stimulated release of endogenous opioid peptides from the perforant path did not significantly reduce inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells. However, perforant path stimulation in the presence of naloxone did cause a dramatic increase in IPSP amplitudes. CA3 pyramidal cells were not directly affected by perforant path stimulation. The naloxone-sensitive increase in IPSPs was delayed 3 min in onset and lasted for several minutes. In addition, the increase in the IPSPs was specifically blocked either by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol or by pretreating the animals with reserpine. These findings indicate that endogenous opioids regulate the effects of norepinephrine in the CA3 region of the guinea pig hippocampus. In addition, endogenously released norepinephrine appeared to act on GABAergic interneurons to increase the amplitude of the IPSP recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells.", 
    "25": "The effects of aging on heart rate and atrioventricular (AV) conduction responses to verapamil (0-100 ng/ml) were studied in Langendorff perfused hearts from 12 mature (4-6 months) and 12 senescent (24 months) male Fischer 344 rats and in hearts from 10 mature and 9 senescent rats after reserpine administration (0.25 mg/kg/day i.p. for 5-7 days). During 30 min of perfusion with verapamil concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 50 and 100 ng/ml in the absence of reserpine administration, intervals between atrial electrograms (A-A intervals), paced AV conduction time and AV Wenckebach cycle lengths increased in hearts from all animals (P less than .001). A-A intervals increased more in senescent vs. mature animals (with marked slowing in 3/12 senescent and 0/12 mature at 100 ng/ml), spontaneous AV Wenckebach block occurred more frequently in hearts from senescent animals (in 7/12 senescent and 1/12 mature, P less than .07) and AV Wenckebach cycle length increased more in senescent vs. mature hearts (from 123 +/- 11 to 294 +/- 108 msec, mean +/- S.D., in mature vs. 154 +/- 16 to 458 +/- 10 msec in senescent hearts). Reserpine administration did not significantly alter qualitative responses to verapamil, but accentuated age differences in responses at higher verapamil concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "There is no consensus for the optimal treatment program for individuals with mild hypertension, including whether treatment should emphasize life-style changes alone, such as weight loss, reduction of sodium and alcohol intake, and increased physical activity, or whether it should also include a pharmacologic component. The dilemma is accentuated by the availability of many drugs from different classes to lower blood pressure. To study the relative efficacy and safety of a combination of pharmacologic and nutritional-hygienic intervention compared with nutritional-hygienic intervention alone, a double-blind, controlled clinical trial was initiated. Nine hundred two men and women with mild hypertension (average blood pressure, 140/91 mm Hg) were randomized to receive nutritional-hygienic intervention plus one of six treatments: (1) placebo; (2) diuretic (chlorthalidone); (3) beta-blocker (acebutolol); (4) alpha 1-antagonist (doxazosin mesylate); (5) calcium antagonist (amlodipine maleate); or (6) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate). After 12 months, weight loss averaged 4.5 kg, urinary sodium excretion was reduced by 23%, and reported leisure-time physical activity was nearly doubled. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the group given nutritional-hygienic intervention alone (placebo) were reduced by 10.6 and 8.1 mm Hg, respectively. For participants in the five groups receiving antihypertensive medication in addition to nutritional-hygienic treatment, blood pressure reductions were significantly greater than those achieved with nutritional-hygienic treatment alone (range, 16 to 22 mm Hg for systolic and 12 to 14 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure). Although differences among treatment groups in certain dimensions of quality of life, self-reported side effects, plasma lipid levels, and biochemical measures were observed, no consistent pattern in the differences was noted. Nutritional-hygienic therapy is an effective first-step treatment for persons with mild hypertension, and significant additional blood pressure lowering with minimal short-term side effects can be achieved by adding one of five different classes of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "27": "Skin potential response (SPR), an electrodermal measure of sudomotor nerve function, was shown in this study to examine specifically sympathetic cholinergic fibers by abolition of the response during atropine infusion but not during propranolol infusion. The difference between responses in the left and right arms (SPR-D) was used to assess autonomic nerve function in 136 patients with diabetes and 52 control subjects. In 82% of the diabetic population (112 of 136), SPR-D was greater than 2SD above the mean control response compared with 42% (57 of 137) greater than 2SD below the mean control age-related value for a standard autonomic test predominantly of parasympathetic function, the R-R interval variation with breathing. Of 15 patients with clinical diabetic autonomic neuropathy, SPR wave forms were bizarre or absent in 5 patients compared with 18 of 121 patients' without clinical autonomic neuropathy (chi 2 = 3.5, P = 0.062). Measurement of SPR-D provides an easily determined measure of sympathetic cholinergic nerve function and may be a useful component of a group of tests for autonomic nerve function in diabetes.",

Appropriate therapy with a combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic antagonist agent prevented further ongoing dissection and amelioration of symptoms. On day 5, an episode of coronary vasospasm occurred presumably due to beta-blockade with unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity.", 
    "29": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, multicenter study was conducted to study the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous dose of sotalol (1.5 mg/kg over 10 minutes) in achieving normal sinus rhythm in paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) lasting greater than or equal to 15 minutes. Patients were randomized to either sotalol or placebo as initial treatment, and if the SVT was not terminated a crossover was performed after 20 minutes. A total of 43 patients were enrolled, 38 of whom with spontaneous (n = 14) or induced (n = 24) SVT were analyzed for sotalol efficacy. Most patients (n = 27) had atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardia, and an important subgroup (n = 11) had circus movement tachycardia, using an accessory pathway for retrograde conduction. The number of patients converting to sinus rhythm as a result of the initial treatment was significantly higher in the sotalol group than in the placebo group, for spontaneous (p less than 0.005) as well as for induced tachycardia (p less than 0.001). Sinus rhythm was achieved within 30 minutes in 83% of all patients who received sotalol as the first drug, compared with 16% of the patients first receiving placebo (p less than 0.0001). For sotalol safety analysis, 42 patients were included. A total of 37 patients received sotalol, 19 as the first treatment, and 18 as the second treatment, while 25 patients received placebo. A total of 15 possible adverse effects were reported, occurring in 10 patients with sotalol versus 4 with placebo. The only severe side effect (hypotension) necessitating termination of drug administration occurred with placebo. No proarrhythmic effects were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "The interference of intraarterial nicardipine, verapamil, and diltiazem with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine was evaluated in hypertensive patients. Nicardipine antagonized the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas verapamil was ineffective, suggesting that functional alpha-adrenergic antagonism may participate in the vasodilatory and possibly the antihypertensive effect. Nicardipine also blunted the vasoconstriction to lower-body negative pressure and the action of angiotensin II administered intraarterially. Despite a comparable increase in basal forearm flow, verapamil was less potent than nicardipine in inhibiting vasoconstriction after both stimuli. Therefore nicardipine suppressed preferentially regional vascular reactivity, probably by blockade of the influx of extracellular calcium in response to receptor activation, because both alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated. At variance with both nicardipine and verapamil was potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine after the administration of diltiazem. Because intraarterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action and the local vasodilatation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered also with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium channel blockers in humans.", 
    "31": "Hyperthyroidism is associated with a marked effect on the cardiovascular system. Despite enhanced resting ventricular systolic performance, thyrotoxicosis has been implicated as a primary cause of cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, and decreased exercise tolerance. To further assess potential alterations in ventricular function we have noninvasively studied diastolic performance in nine newly diagnosed and untreated hyperthyroid patients. Parameters including diastolic flow velocities, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), and the rate of diastolic flow deceleration were compared to those of an age- and sex-matched control population, and then repeat determinations were made after beta-adrenergic blockade and again when the patients were chemically and clinically euthyroid. Before treatment the IVRT was 33.0 ms, which was significantly (P less than 0.005) shorter than the control value (57.9 ms) and in combination with other measures of diastolic function indicated enhanced left ventricular relaxation. beta-Adrenergic blockade slowed the resting heart rate from 97 to 80 beats/min (P less than 0.005) and partially normalized the rate of diastolic deceleration, but had no effect on the IVRT (33.8 ms). When patients were euthyroid, the IVRT was 51.7 ms, and other measures of diastolic performance were the same as those in controls. The current data assessing resting diastolic function in hyperthyroidism are similar to those previously reported for systolic function. Our findings of enhanced cardiac diastolic performance do not support the hypothesis that thyrotoxicosis is associated with compromised left ventricular function and suggest the possibility that the cardiac symptoms that accompany hyperthyroidism may be due to noncardiac mechanisms.", 
    "32": "The evidence that free oxygen radicals produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) participate in generation of reperfusion arrhythmias is well documented. The in vitro effect of selected antiarrhythmic drugs on PMN free radicals production was evaluated by luminol- (LuCL) and lucigenin- (LgCL) amplified chemiluminescence stimulated with opsonized zymosan (o.z.) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Fast sodium channel inhibitors varied in the influence on PMN chemiluminescence: from an inhibition in all models studied by procainamide, to lack of an effect by mexiletine. Propafenone, similarly to ajmaline and verapamil, inhibited LuCL stimulated with PMA, as well as LgCL after stimulation with both PMA and o.z. Bretylium tosylate decreased LuCL stimulated with both inducers, with no effect on LgCL. Amiodarone in high concentrations inhibited both LuCL and LgCL. beta-blockers propranolol and practolol impaired LuCL stimulated with o.z., as well as LgCL induced with PMA, whereas alpha-blocker phentolamine inhibited LuCL and LgCL stimulated with both inducers. The drugs' effect on PMN free oxygen radicals production may constitute an additional mechanism of their activity.", 
    "33": "Since their introduction in clinical practice beta-blocker drugs are known to be able to induce bronchospasm. However, this adverse effect may develop only in subjects with asthma, chronic bronchitis and/or airways hyper-reactivity. Although this potentially adverse effect of beta-blockers on the airways has long been recognized, its mechanism in inducing bronchospasm remains unclear. The Authors report a case of severe bronchoconstrictive episodes with respiratory failure following the administration of a timolol ophthalmic solution in a 51 yr old woman. Pharmacokinetics, preventive and therapeutic aspects of timolol eyedrop-induced bronchospasm are discussed.", 
    "34": "REM sleep deprivation (REMSD) results in behavioral changes such as the appearance of affective aggression induced by apomorphine (APO) and other dopaminergic agents. REMSD modifies dopamine-mediated behavior as well as the adrenergic receptor sensitivity. This paper evaluates the interaction between these two neurotransmission systems through changes in APO-, DL-DOPA- and fusaric acid (FA)-induced aggressive behavior in REMSD rats pretreated with phentolamine, propranolol, metaraminol, prazosin, clonidine, yohimbine, isoproterenol, butoxamine and maprotiline. Only isoproterenol reduced FA-induced aggressiveness. No specific changes in aggressiveness were noticed with other treatments and not even inhibitors of norepinephrine transmission induced aggressive behavior. It is concluded that norepinephrine had a slight inhibitory action on aggressiveness elicited by dopaminomimetic agents in REMSD rats. Beta-adrenoceptors could be responsible for this effect since only beta-selective drugs reduced aggression. As REMSD reduces beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity, only minor changes in aggressiveness could be observed. It was noted that the three drugs used to induce aggressive behavior elicited different patterns of aggression.", 
    "35": "Alkyl monoesters of poly(vinyl methyl ether-maleic anhydride) (PVM-MA) are acidic bioerodible polymers that have been used in cosmetics and tablet film coatings. They may be suitable for topical controlled-release applications since the polymeric backbone is not cleaved to smaller fragments that could be absorbed into the systemic circulation. The dissolution of these polymers depends on the length of the alkyl ester chain of the polymer and on the pH on the polymer surface. We studied the effect of the molecular weight of the polymer on in vitro release of timolol from matrices of n-propyl, n-butyl, and n-hexyl monoesters of PVM-MA. The effect of a basic additive, disodium phosphate, on timolol release from the polymers was also evaluated. The rate of timolol release decreased with increasing length of the alkyl side chain in the polymer. Drug release from the n-propyl and n-butyl monoesters followed zero-order release kinetics, but that from the n-hexyl monoester followed square root-of-time release kinetics. The molecular weight of the polymer did not affect drug release from the matrices without disodium phosphate. With the basic additive, the rate of timolol release increased with increasing molecular weight from the matrices of n-propyl and n-butyl monoesters of PVM-MA, but had only a very small effect on drug release from the n-hexyl monoester. Release of timolol from the n-propyl and n-butyl monoesters was controlled by polymer dissolution and, thus, it was affected by the basic additive in the matrix. Diffusion-controlled drug release from the n-hexyl ester was not affected by disodium phosphate.", 
    "36": "The effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) on ischaemic myocardium was investigated in the presence of beta-receptor blockade. Three anaesthetics were compared in each of six dogs: isoflurane 1.8% alone, isoflurane 1.4% with 50% N2O, and isoflurane 1.8% with 50% N2O. Heart rate (HR), systolic aortic blood pressure (SBP), and left atrial pressure (LAP) were held constant during the three treatments. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was cannulated and perfused with an autoperfusion circuit. Systolic segment length was measured with a sonomicrometer in the LAD and circumflex regions. Regional myocardial blood flow was measured using radioactive microspheres. Propranolol was administered intravenously and then measurements were made during imposition of a stenosis on the perfusion circuit sufficient to decrease systolic shortening by 30%. The substitution of 50% N2O for 0.4% isoflurane had no effect on systolic shortening or transmural myocardial blood flow in the ischaemic or normal region. When N2O was added to 1.8% isoflurane, systolic shortening decreased by 34.6% in the ischaemic and 57.3% in the normally perfused region, while transmural myocardial blood flow distribution did not change significantly. The decrease in shortening was therefore not due to increased ischaemia. These results were similar to those of a previous experiment which was identical except that beta-blockade was absent. It is concluded that beta-receptor blockade does not markedly alter the response of normal or ischaemic myocardium to N2O.", 
    "37": "A multifactorial health-education program designed to enhance compliance with a once-daily regimen of atenolol was evaluated among 453 patients enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs). The initiation of the 180-day study period was used to classify patients as either new or existing cases of hypertension. In turn, patients in these two categories were randomly assigned to a control or an experimental group. Patients assigned to the experimental groups received an enrollment kit upon exercising their initial prescription (new patients) or their first refill request (existing patients). The kit contained: a 30-day supply of atenolol; an educational newsletter about hypertension; information on nutrition and life-style changes; and an explanation of the intent and content of the program. Before the next scheduled prescription-refill date, each patient was contacted by telephone to inquire about his or her experience with the therapy and to stress the importance of adherence to the regimen. Each month thereafter, the newsletter and an enclosed prescription-refill reminder were mailed to each patient. The medication possession ratio, defined as the number of days' supply of atenolol obtained by a patient during the 180-day study period, was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) enhanced for the new and existing experimental groups relative to the control groups. Multiple regression analyses revealed that enrollment in the health-education program increased the number of days' supply of atenolol obtained by existing patients by 27 (P less than or equal to 0.001), and by new patients by 40 (P less than or equal to 0.001).", 
    "38": "Eighteen patients with essential hypertension received 50 to 200 mg of dilevalol or 60 to 90 mg of propranolol daily for six weeks. Mean arterial blood pressure and venous pressure were significantly reduced in the dilevalol-treated patients at six weeks but were unchanged in the propranolol-treated patients. The cardiac index and systemic vascular resistance remained unchanged in the dilevalol group, but were significantly reduced (cardiac index) or increased (systemic vascular resistance) in the propranolol group. No changes in heart rate were noted in either treatment group. It is concluded that dilevalol has some ideal features for the treatment of hypertension, but further research is needed to determine the causes of fatal hepatotoxicity reported in a few cases.", 
    "39": "1. Using a grease-gap technique, we studied the action of histamine on the d.c. potential recorded between the internal carotid nerve and the main body of the isolated superior cervical ganglion of the rat. 2. A small, slow depolarization was evoked by 10-300 microM histamine. This response was not reduced by lowering the calcium concentration in the superfusing medium (from 2.5 to 0.1 mM), or by superfusing tetrodotoxin, N-methylatropine, or propranolol (all at 1 microM). 3. Mepyramine (10 nM) antagonized this depolarization, but cimetidine (10 microM), metiamide (30 microM), burimamide (10 microM) and impromidine (1 microM) did not. Two other agonists also evoked a mepyramine-sensitive slow depolarization. The rank order of potencies was histamine greater than N alpha-methyl-histamine greater than 2-methyl-histamine. 4. At concentrations greater than 1 mM, histamine also evoked a larger, faster depolarization. This response was undiminished by reducing the calcium concentration of the medium to 0.1 mM or by adding 1 microM tetrodotoxin. The rank order of potency for the agonists was N alpha-methyl-histamine greater than histamine approximately 2-methyl-histamine. The histamine-induced fast response was not antagonized by any of the above-mentioned antagonists. It was slightly reduced by (+)-tubocurarine (100 microM) and N-methylbicuculline (100 microM) but such effects were not consistent with the blockade of nicotinic or GABAA receptor-mediated responses. 5. It was concluded that histamine depolarized the isolated superior cervical ganglion of the rat by activating H1 receptors. Relatively high concentrations of histamine also evoked a fast depolarization of this preparation, but this did not appear to be mediated by H1, H2 or H3 receptors.", 
    "40": "The effects of oral propranolol were studied in 24 patients with the WPW syndrome. The average daily dose of propranolol was 130 +/- 24 mg administered in 3 doses over a period of 48 to 72 hours. Endocavitary electrophysiological study was performed 2 to 4 hours after the last dose. The effective anterograde refractory periods (EARP) of the accessory and normal pathways were measured before and after propranolol (and, in both studies, before and after isoproterenol). The EARP of the accessory pathway was not affected by the propranolol. However, in the 9 patients in whom its value was less than 270 ms, it increased significantly (p = 0.01). The EARP of the accessory pathway measured after administration of isoproterenol increased significantly in all patients with oral propranolol (p = 0.001). Sustained reciprocating tachycardia could be induced in 19 patients and non-sustained reciprocating tachycardia in 5 other patients during base line electrophysiological study. Oral propranolol prevented the induction of the tachycardias in 18 patients (75%), even after isoproterenol. The shortest R-R interval between two pre-excited complexes in atrial fibrillation increased after propranolol (283 +/- 45 to 343 +/- 95 ms). These results show that oral propranolol increases the EARP of the accessory pathway and the shortest R-R interval between two pre-excited complexes in atrial fibrillation in patients with short anterograde refractory periods of their accessory pathways, and is effective in preventing reciprocating tachycardia. Oral propranolol may be useful and can be used safely in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.", 
    "41": "The author investigated the effects of several antiglaucomatous drugs and prostaglandins (E2 and F2 alpha) on intraocular pressure responses in pigmented and albino rabbits, and spectrophotometrically assessed the binding of these drugs to synthetic melanin. Topical application of 0.5% timolol, 1% epinephrine and 3% pilocarpine had greater ocular hypotensive effects in albino rabbits than in pigmented rabbits. However no such differences were seen with application of prostaglandins. Melanin binding of drugs was higher in the order of befunolol, carteolol, timolol, epinephrine and pilocarpine. At higher concentrations of the drugs, the degree of binding increased. Prostaglandins had no binding ability. Thus drugs with lower hypotensive effects in pigmented rabbits than in albino rabbits had high melanin binding ability, whereas drugs with similar effects in pigmented and albino rabbits had no melanin binding ability. It is speculated that some antiglaucomatous drugs bind to melanin, resulting in decreased pharmacological action.", 
    "42": "The effectiveness of the penetration enhancers, dodecyl N,N-dimethylamino acetate (DDAA) and Azone, on pretreated human epidermis for the permeation of model drugs, indomethacin, 5-fluorouracil, and propranolol-HCl, was studied in in vitro diffusion cells. Snakeskin (Elaphe obsoleta) and rabbit pinna skin were compared as possible models for human skin. The drug concentrations were analyzed by HPLC. With all skins and all model drugs, DDAA increased drug permeability at least as well as Azone, and in most cases it was a more effective permeation enhancer. The relative permeation improvements in human skin, snakeskin, and rabbit skin were 10- to 20-, 5- to 50-, and 20- to 120-fold, respectively. Tritiated water served as an indicator of skin condition. Its penetration in the skin samples was independent of the drugs used, and both penetration enhancers significantly increased the flux of tritiated water through all skins. Thus, DDAA and Azone significantly increased the permeation of lipophilic and hydrophilic model compounds. Rabbit pinna skin was a poor model for human skin in vitro, while snakeskin was much closer to human skin in terms of transdermal permeability. In most cases drug permeability decreased in the order rabbit much greater than human greater than or less than snake.", 
    "43": "A controlled drug delivery device based on the principle of electrophoresis is described. A model system using propranolol HCl and PHEMA films was used to demonstrate how control over the release of a model drug may be achieved using low constant electric currents. It was found that a linear relationship existed between electric current and drug delivery rate. Additionally, two main effects of applying an electric current during the lag period of delivery from the system were identified. First, the drug delivery rate was less when a current was applied before the lag period had expired, and second, the voltage-time profiles were found to be significantly different. The model shows the feasibility of using an electrophoretically controlled drug delivery device to provide truly controllable and predictable release rates.", 
    "44": "It has been postulated that intrathoracic pressure increases may impair cardiac function by decreasing coronary flow. To determine whether altered coronary flow causes or results from change in cardiac function, we used 14 anesthetized dogs in propranolol-induced heart failure following atrioventricular node ablation. After thoracoabdominal binding, the animals were paced and ventilated at the same frequency, and inspiration was synchronized with cardiac systole, resulting in systole-specific pericardial pressure increases (SSPPI). At SSPPI magnitudes of 15 and 30 mmHg, left atrial transmural pressure decreased and cardiac output increased, whereas decreases in left ventricular end-systolic transmural pressure and myocardial O2 consumption were directly related. Concurrent decreases in coronary sinus flow (CSF) and coronary arteriovenous O2 gradient with SSPPI 15 mmHg indicate autoregulation. However, the arteriovenous O2 gradient remained unaltered with SSPPI 30 mmHg, despite further decrease in CSF. Because the absolute diastolic aortic pressure decreased, a limit may exist for increasing SSPPI above which CSF may be directly affected.", 
    "45": "The inhibitory effect of 50 mg/kg lysyl acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) intravenously injected 24 and 4 h before 80 micrograms/kg adrenaline, 40 mg/kg indobufen injected 15 min before, or a combination of ASA plus indobufen on the platelet aggregation and kinetics was evaluated in anaesthetized dogs previously injected with 111indium- (111In-) labelled platelets using gamma-camera dynamics studies. The highest degree of inhibition, indicated by the lowest platelet aggregation ratio decrease and the most significant 111In-labelled platelet mobilization from hepatic and splenic stores with a corresponding increase of labelled and unlabelled platelet counts in blood, was obtained in ASA-treated dogs. Such changes were less marked when ASA plus indobufen was injected. In indobufen-treated dogs a similar mobilization of 111In-labelled platelets with an increase in circulating platelet numbers was evident only after the second adrenaline injection. It is concluded that platelet mobilization is mainly dependent on the production of an ASA-sensitive substance.",

During pacing, action potential duration, amplitude, maximum diastolic potential (only in primary pacemaker fibres), and diastolic depolarisation rate were all decreased. Action potential duration, amplitude and maximum diastolic potential returned to control value during the first cycle following a period of overdrive, but diastolic depolarisation remained depressed during many consecutive cycles. In primary pacemaker fibres, diastolic depolarisation appeared to be depressed throughout diastole. In latent pacemaker fibres diastolic depolarisation was depressed only in the second part of the diastole.",

    "51": "The effects of different types of adrenoceptor blocking agents on portal venous blood flow were studied in 10 patients with liver cirrhosis by using a duplex Doppler system. Oral atenolol (selective beta 1 blocker), propranolol (non-selective beta blocker), and labetalol (non-selective adrenoceptor blocker) were compared. The drugs were administered at random at an interval of 3 days or more. Hemodynamic measurements were done before and after 1 h, 2 h, and 3 h of therapy. Atenolol and propranolol produced significant decrease in the portal vein cross-sectional area, portal blood velocity, and estimated volume of the portal blood flow. The portal blood velocity decreased by 13.1 +/- 7.2% 3 h after atenolol and by 16.2 +/- 6.5% 3 h after propranolol administration (p less than 0.05). Labetalol had no significant influence on portal venous hemodynamics. These results support the hypothesis that a decrease in portal venous flow induced by beta blockers is at least partly mediated with alpha-adrenergic receptors.",

After at least 2 weeks of twice daily timolol 0.5% therapy, PGF2 alpha-IE, 0.5 microgram in 30 microliters, was topically applied twice daily at 8 AM and 8 PM, 5 minutes before each timolol dose, for 7 days. Intraocular pressures were measured before timolol treatment, and at 8 AM, 8:30 AM, 12 PM, 2 PM, and 4 PM on the day before the addition of PGF2 alpha-IE, and on day 1 and on day 7 of combined therapy. Mean IOP was 39 +/- 2 mmHg (+/- standard error) before timolol therapy and 31 +/- 2 mmHg after at least 2 weeks of treatment with timolol alone. A significant (P = 0.004) further reduction of IOP was first observed 4 hours after the first dose of PGF2 alpha-IE, which was maintained throughout the duration of combined therapy. During the last day of combined treatment and at 12 hours after the final dose, IOP was reduced a mean of 6 to 9 mmHg (mean, 9.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg at 12 hours) below baseline values obtained with timolol alone. These results indicate that adding PGF2 alpha-IE in patients treated with timolol causes a further reduction of IOP that may prove to be clinically useful in glaucoma therapy.", 
    "53": "The OMCDi secretes Cl- when perfused and bathed with symmetrical solutions. The route for this transepithelial Cl- movement appears to be the paracellular pathway, and the driving force is the lumen positive voltage generated by the process of electrogenic H+ secretion. Currently, there is no evidence to support the existence of a significant transcellular route for transepithelial Cl- movement. Although the primary function of the OMCDi is related to urine acidification, Cl- plays an important role in this process. The basolateral membrane of the OMCDi cell contains a band-3 related Cl-/HCO3- antiporter and a Cl- conductance. The Cl-/HCO3- antiporter serves as the primary route for the efflux of HCO3- generated during the process of H+ secretion. The Cl- conductance allows Cl- brought into the cell by the antiporter to recycle across this membrane. This conductance also serves to maintain cell charge balance. Accordingly, for each equivalent of H+ leaving the cell across the apical membrane, a Cl- equivalent exits the cell across the basolateral membrane. Based on whole-cell patch-clamp studies, this Cl- conductance is blocked by the Cl- channel blocker DPC. This conductance may also have a finite permeability to HCO3-, and thus could serve as a secondary route for cellular HCO3- efflux. Lastly, the conductance is activated by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol.",

Isoproterenol did not consistently retard rate of protein degradation of the total protein (TP), myofibrillar protein (MFP) pools, and myosin heavy-chain subunit (MHC); degradation of these protein pools tended to be slowed by inclusion of ISO in the culture medium. After acute treatment of 1 X 10(-4) M ISO for 2 h, TP, but not MFP and MHC, synthesis rate was increased, and after chronic exposure to 1 X 10(-4), 1 X 10(-5), and 1 X 10(-6) M ISO, TP, MFP, and MHC synthesis rates and net accumulation of TP, cytoplasmic protein, and MHC fractions were enhanced (P less than .05). The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (1 X 10(-5) M) blocked chronic stimulatory effects of ISO. Furthermore, after 48 h of exposure to ISO, effects on protein synthesis were less pronounced than those observed after 24 h of exposure. Isoproterenol imparted a more pronounced effect on protein synthesis than on protein degradation, indicating that increased muscle protein accretion observed in animals after ISO treatment is likely a function of enhanced protein synthesis.", 
    "56": "Test anxiety is severely disabling to students whose fear of examinations causes cognitive dysfunction that paralyzes their thinking the way stage fright impairs actors ability to act. In studies using subjective evaluations among actors and musicians, beta-blockade relieved stage fright and has been used informally to treat test anxiety in students without objective measures of effectiveness. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was chosen as an objective test instrument to confirm the effect of beta-blockade on test anxiety and performance. Thirty-two high school students who had already taken the SAT before enrolling in this study and who had stress-induced cognitive dysfunction on exams were given 40 mg of propranolol one hour before they retook those tests. Mean SAT scores with beta-blockade were 130 points higher than on the initial SAT done before entering the study without medication (p = less than .01). A single dose of propranolol immediately before the SAT permitted improved performance in students prone to cognitive dysfunction due to test anxiety.", 
    "57": "Clinical trials of new drugs in the treatment of angina pectoris frequently make use of exercise tests to evaluate efficacy. The crossover design is often employed. The methods commonly used to analyse the various exercise times, for example, 'time to pain', are insensitive and potentially biased by the manner in which they deal with the censored nature of the data. Survival analysis can be adapted for use in crossover trials, both in a relatively simple way, and also through the full power of the Cox model. This is considerably more sensitive and not subject to the same bias. This methodology leads to the use of median survival times to illustrate treatment effects and this provides a practical interpretation of clinical relevance. The estimation of median survival times in crossover trials poses some special problems. The methodology is illustrated throughout by means of a specific two-period example in which atenolol was compared with the combination of atenolol and nifedipine. The three-period design is also briefly discussed.", 
    "58": "To investigate the beta-cell cytotrophic action of tolbutamide, pancreatic cells were dissociated from neonatal rat pancreata and then cultured for 10 days in the presence of various concentrations of tolbutamide. After counting insulin-positive beta cells, dose-response curves were plotted and analyzed. Increasing concentrations of tolbutamide cause an increase in beta-cell numbers until a maximum response is reached at a concentration of about 100 micrograms/ml. At greater concentrations, tolbutamide becomes inhibitory. At concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml of tolbutamide, beta-cell numbers are doubled. We further investigated the effect of glucose on tolbutamide-induced stimulation. Tolbutamide fails to stimulate beta cells after culture in medium containing low glucose concentrations. High concentrations of glucose are required for tolbutamide action. Preexposure for as little as 16 h to low glucose abolishes the stimulatory action of tolbutamide. The experiments indicate that adequate glucose concentrations are necessary for the preservation of tolbutamide-induced beta-cell survival and proliferation. Addition to the culture medium of the calcium channel blocker diltiazem or the calmodulin antagonist chlorpromazine affects a decrease in beta-cell numbers. This decrease depends on the concentration of the drug. Addition of tolbutamide reverses that decrease, which suggests that calcium is required for beta-cell survival and proliferation. Tolbutamide action seems to be specific, since fibroblasts are unaffected at concentrations of tolbutamide that are stimulatory for beta cells. At high concentrations, tolbutamide is cytotoxic for fibroblasts. Comparison with other sulfonylureas supports the superior activity of tolbutamide. The \"second generation\" sulfonylurea glyburide is cytotoxic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Lesion of the anteroventral portion of the third cerebral ventricle causes hypernatremia, adipsia, and attenuation of the pressor response to intravenous administration of angiotensin II and norepinephrine. In addition, these lesions prevent the development of several experimental models of hypertension. In this study, a lesion of the third cerebral ventricle region was made in 14 dogs. In seven dogs in which hypernatremia developed the lesions included the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis; seven animals in which the circumventricular organ was spared by the lesion remained normonatremic. Vascular responsiveness of isolated right carotid artery rings to angiotensin II and phenylephrine was assessed 3 days after lesioning the anteroventral portion of the third cerebral ventricle. In endothelium-denuded ring vessels, vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine were significantly decreased in animals both with and without inclusion of the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis. A similar effect was observed in intact vessels of dogs in which the circumventricular organ was spared but not in those with lesions that included this area. In contrast, angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction was significantly decreased in the arteries with intact endothelium of both groups of lesioned animals. These data show that lesion of the anteroventral third ventricle area alters alpha 1-adrenergic and angiotensin II vascular responsiveness in isolated carotid artery rings with the possible participation of the endothelium.",

Proforma regarding socio-economic status and the patients' reaction to long-term medication were recorded. Though the objective and subjective effects of long term medication were negligible the financial constraints were considerable. More than 70% patient would prefer laser's and surgery because of the cumbersome schedule and financial burden. The visit to the clinic was a time consuming process suggesting a lack of adequate glaucoma follow-up at the peripheral level. The study reflects a need for reorientation of glaucoma management.", 
    "61": "A study of 30 subjects (10 normal and 20 having glaucoma) was done to find out the scleral rigidity in glaucoma cases as compared to normal. The effect of miotics, timolol (0.25%) and pilocarpine (2%) eye drops on the scleral rigidity in cases of glaucoma was observed.", 
    "62": "The effect of a single oral dose of propanolol 80 mg, dilevalol 200 mg, salbutamol 4 mg, and placebo on the systolic (BPs), diastolic blood (BPd), intraocular pressure (IOP), on retinal vessel diameter (D), blood velocity (Vmax) and volumetric retinal blood flow (RBF), was measured at baseline, 90 minutes and three hours after administration in normotensive diabetic volunteers. These drugs were chosen to demonstrate a range of beta receptor activity. Propanolol is a non-specific beta blocker, affecting beta 1 and beta 2 receptors, dilevalol has beta 1 antagonist and beta 2 agonist effects and salbutamol has beta 2 agonist effects. Retinal blood flow was measured by bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry (BLDV) and red free photography. Dilevalol reduced the mean BPs by 10.4 mmHg (SD 4.2, P less than 0.05), the mean BPd by 7 mmHg (SD 3.8, P less than 0.05), whereas propanolol, salbutamol and placebo had no significant effect. Propanolol reduced the mean intraocular pressure by 4.88 mmHg (SD 1.8, P less than 0.01). No treatment had a significant effect on retinal perfusion pressure. In all treatments the vessel diameter and volumetric flow remained unchanged, and there was no significant difference between the treatments. The mechanisms of action of these drugs are analysed and the possible implications of their use in patients with retinal disease are discussed.",

The mean age was 29.4 +/- 9.8 years for Graves' cases and 48.0 +/- 10.9 years for toxic multinodular goitre cases. The clinical presentation was similar to the ones already known and all responded to propylthiouracil therapy. Two Graves' cases, however, had discordant hypothyroxinaemia and hypertriiodothyroninaemia while on therapy. Eight patients underwent subtotal thyroidectomy of whom 1 became hypothyroid 1 year later while 6 remained euthyroid 2 1/2 years after surgery; the other patient did not return subsequently. The result of this study shows that thyrotoxicosis is not as rare as it was previously thought.", 
    "65": "The effects of a series of fatty acids on the rectal absorption of propranolol (PL) were examined in vitro, using macrogol 1500 base and rat rectal tissue. Lauric acid, at a fatty acid: PL molar ratio of 1:1, produced the largest increase in permeation rate (Js), penetration coefficient and partition coefficient of PL. PL flux was increased 2.5-fold in the presence of lauric acid compared to that without the fatty acid. However, the Js value of PL was decreased at increased molar ratios (e.g., 3:1) of lauric acid. The permeation rate of lauric acid across the rectal membrane was much larger than that of PL. Furthermore, the apparent partition coefficient of PL in an n-octanol/buffer system was significantly increased at a 1:1 molar ratio to lauric acid compared with that of PL alone. These results suggest that a complex-mediated mechanism facilitates PL transport, thereby partially contributing to the enhancement of PL rectal absorption. A similar mechanism is applicable to percutaneous drug absorption, as reported previously. Thus, a portion of PL, after first forming a complex with fatty acids, may rapidly permeate across rectal membranes.", 
    "66": "Although stimulated [3H] inositol phosphate turnover has been demonstrated in isolated, perfused [3H] inositol prelabelled rat hearts, there is still no information regarding Ins (1,4,5)P3 levels in intact cardiac muscle. Using a D-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3 assay system, Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels were determined in isolated perfused rats hearts during ischaemia, reperfusion and alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation via noradrenaline (3 x 10(-5) M). Control hearts contained +/- 674 pmols Ins(1,4,5)P3/g dry heart weight. Myocardial Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels were significantly decreased (+/- 389 pmols/g dry heart weight) after exposure to 20 mins of normothermic ischaemic cardiac arrest (NICA). Reperfusion produced a marked increase in Ins(1,4,5,)P3 levels (+/- 1,115 pmols/g dry heart weight) after only 30 s. Noradrenaline caused a 3-4 fold increase in tissue Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels within 30 s. After 20 mins stimulation with noradrenaline, the Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels were still significantly elevated. The rise in tissue Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels during reperfusion as well as during noradrenaline administration was counteracted by neomycin (0.5 x 10(-3) M), an inhibitor of phosphoinositidase specific phospholipase C. In both events neomycin restored the Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels to control values. For correlation of tissue Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels with mechanical events, noradrenaline (3 x 10(-5) M), in the presence of 10 mM LiCl, 10(-7) M propranolol and 10(-7) M atropine, was administered to isolated perfused rat hearts and the mechanical performance recorded over a period of 20 mins. Noradrenaline caused a significant increase in peak systolic pressure and work performance which was maintained for at least 10 mins, suggesting that the positive inotropic effects of noradrenaline may be provoked by Ins(1,4,5)P3. Furthermore, the finding that 20 min NICA followed by 30 s reperfusion causes an immediate significant increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 content suggests a role for the phosphatidylinositol pathway in the intracellular Ca2+ overloading, characteristic of ischaemia-reperfusion.",

    "68": "The acute administration of the pineal hormone melatonin (1 mg/kg) to rats was shown to increase, and the chronic use to decrease intensity of haloperidol-induced catalepsy with the reorganization of the rhythmic pattern of the neuroleptic effect. The direct opposite shifts were observed after pinealectomy or propranolol chronic administration (1 mg/kg). It is suggested that owing to its own adaptive properties the pineal gland can participate in the formation of drug tolerance.", 
    "69": "The present experiments confirmed that rats injected with naloxone and exposed to a heated floor acquired a hypoalgesic response, as indexed by the latencies to lick their paws. The expression of these latencies were unaffected by yohimbine, clonidine, propranolol, or by relatively moderate doses of prazosin, suggesting that the conditioned hypoalgesic response induced by pairings of naloxone and a heated floor is not mediated by the release and turnover of noradrenaline.", 
    "70": "Day-old chicks trained on a single trial passive discrimination avoidance task using a concentrated chemical aversant, methyl anthranilate (MeA), have been shown to exhibit three stages of memory processing: short, intermediate and long term. A similar learning task with the aversant diluted to 20% in ethanol leads to short- and intermediate-term memory only, but not to long-term memory. The emergence of long-term memory has been shown to be associated with the production of a nonenergy-dependent phase of the intermediate memory stage. Subcutaneous administration of propranolol proved capable of inhibiting this nonenergy-dependent phase of memory under a number of training regimes: strongly reinforced training, and with weakly reinforced training presented twice or coupled with a selected dose of the stress-related hormone ACTH. This study supports the notion that there is a phase of memory that occurs prior to the protein synthesis-dependent phase of memory which is susceptible to interference by drugs affecting noradrenergic processes and which may be associated with the intensity of the training stimulus.", 
    "71": "An improved assay for racemic atenolol (AT) concentrations in human plasma and urine is described using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method with fluorescence detection. The method has a sensitivity limit of 0.5 micrograms/L in plasma with acceptable within- and between-run reproducibilities, and demonstrated linearity at concentrations up to 2,000 micrograms/L. A pilot clinical evaluation of the assay was undertaken on 56 trough plasma specimens from 36 outpatients on established AT therapy. Atenolol concentrations in these patients showed large variations at all prescribed doses, including undetectable levels in four patients (revealing unsuspected noncompliance). Because of its sensitivity and applicability to urinary analysis, the method can be used for pharmacokinetic studies and, under certain circumstances, may be valuable in clinical therapeutic drug monitoring.", 
    "72": "The single doses of three reference antihypertensive drugs: corinfar (20 mg), anapriline (80 mg), and hypothiazide (50 mg) were screened on day 5 of drug administration at rest and during paired isometric and dynamic exercises in comparison to placebo. There was a significant decrease in blood pressures: systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) (p less than 0.01-0.001) at rest and during isometric and dynamic exercises after single doses of corinfar and hypothiazide versus placebo. A single dose of anapriline resulted in a significant reduction in SBP and MBP at rest and during dynamic exercise (p less than 0.05-0.001), in DBP at rest (p less than 0.05) and in an insignificant decrease in SBP, DBP, and MBP during isometric exercise and DBP during dynamic exercise. The agents were graded in terms of the effect of placebo from the mean group and individual hypotensive effects (by each blood pressure parameter). The resting dynamic exercise failed to yield some new evidence for determining the efficacy of corinfar and hypothiazide, whereas it was informative for anapriline with regard to SBP. With respect to SBP, DBP, and MBP, isometric exercise was informative for hypothiazide.", 
    "73": "Minor trauma to the head or neck is occasionally followed by severe chronic headaches. We have evaluated 35 adults (27 women, 8 men) with no prior history of headaches, who developed recurrent episodic attacks typical of common or classic migraine following minor head or neck injuries (\"post-traumatic migraine\"-PTM). The median age of these patients was 38 years (range 17 to 63 years), which is older than the usual age at onset of idiopathic migraine. The trauma was relatively minor: 14 patients experienced head trauma with brief loss of consciousness, 14 patients sustained head trauma without loss of consciousness, and 7 patients had a \"whiplash\" neck injury with no documented head trauma. Headaches began immediately or within the first few days after the injury. PTM typically recurred several times per week and was often incapacitating. The patients had been unsuccessfully treated by other physicians, and there was a median delay of 4 months (range 1 to 30 months) before the diagnosis of PTM was suspected. The response to prophylactic anti-migraine medication (propranolol or amitriptyline used alone or in combination) was gratifying, with 21 of 30 adequately treated patients (70%) reporting dramatic reduction in the frequency and severity of their headaches. Improvement was noted in 18 of the 23 patients (78%) who were still involved in litigation at the time of treatment. The neurologic literature has placed excessive emphasis on compensation neurosis and psychological factors in the etiology of chronic headaches after minor trauma. Physicians must be aware of PTM, as it is both common and treatable.", 
    "74": "Rapid lowering of severe hypertension is essential to prevent irreversible damage to vital organs. The patient's clinical status should be evaluated, noting particularly cardiac, neurologic, and renal functions. Choice of treatment should be based on speed and efficacy of action and on hemodynamic, vascular, and renal consequences. It is also important to preserve circulatory homeostasis and vital organ function. Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, diazoxide, and hydralazine have been used parenterally for rapid control of severe hypertension, but they do not always produce optimal, balanced hemodynamic effects. Calcium antagonists have been advocated because of their beneficial circulatory effects. Nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, produces significant antihypertensive effects, and when given intravenously, results in a rapid fall in blood pressure. Studies have confirmed that nicardipine is effective and safe in the management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises. Because the aim of rapidly controlling severe hypertension is to prevent target organ dysfunction, nicardipine therapy offers a useful additional option in the clinical management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises.", 
    "75": "The clinical benefits and hemodynamic effects of continuous alprenolol infusion for control of hypertension in the acute stage of ruptured cerebral aneurysms were investigated. Twenty-five patients manifesting systemic hypertension (greater than 160/100 mmHg) were treated with alprenolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, and trimethaphan camsilate, a ganglionic blocker, given intravenously. All drugs decreased the mean arterial blood pressure significantly. However, alprenolol decreased the heart rate and cardiac index while phentolamine increased them. Alprenolol also decreased arterial catecholamine and renin activity, but caused no change in central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and systemic vascular resistance. The results indicate the usefulness of continuous alprenolol infusion for the control of acute hypertension in hemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease. The mode of action of alprenolol is also discussed.", 
    "76": "The effects of nicotine on the sinus rate and atrial or left ventricular contractile force were investigated in the isolated, blood-perfused dog right atrium and left ventricle. Nicotine (3-300 nmol) in the right atrium induced dose-dependent negative followed by positive chronotropic and inotropic responses, whereas nicotine caused only a positive inotropic response in the left ventricle. The negative responses to nicotine were blocked by atropine, hexamethonium (C6), and tetrodotoxin (TTX). The positive effects of nicotine were abolished by propranolol and C6. TTX significantly inhibited the positive responses to nicotine by about 50% in the atrial preparation and totally suppressed them in the left ventricle. Imipramine inhibited the positive cardiac responses to nicotine and tyramine, but potentiated the responses to noradrenaline (NA) in atrial and ventricular preparations. These results suggest that (a) nicotine induces negative and positive cardiac effects mediated by parasympathetic ganglionic nicotinic receptors and presynaptic nicotinic receptors of the postganglionic sympathetic nerves, respectively, in the dog heart; (b) there are few parasympathetic ganglionic cells in the dog left ventricle; (c) the positive cardiac responses to nicotine are caused by both TTX-sensitive and TTX-insensitive NA release mechanisms; and (d) imipramine inhibits the positive cardiac responses to nicotine at the presynaptic nicotinic receptor sites of the postganglionic sympathetic nerves.", 
    "77": "The effects of exercise on bisoprolol oral pharmacokinetics were studied in eight healthy male volunteers in an open, randomized, three-period, crossover trial. Oral bisoprolol (20 mg) was given either at rest during 24 h or with iterative stress tests before and 2.5, 5, 10, and 24 h after dosing. Exercise tests were repeated on a third placebo period. Bisoprolol was assayed in plasma and urines, and plasma catecholamines were measured before and after stress tests, Cmax, Tmax, elimination t1/2, and renal clearance of bisoprolol were not significantly modified by exercise. AUC0-infinity significantly decreased by 7.5% (p less than 0.05) with stress test resulting in an increase in apparent oral clearance. The beta-blocking effect peaked at 2.5 h, lasted greater than 24 h, and was related to plasma levels. The exercise-induced increase in plasma norepinephrine levels was significantly augmented with bisoprolol. These results suggest that repeated exercise tests exerted only limited effects on the oral pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol.", 
    "78": "Plasma insulin levels and the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin (SI) have pathophysiological, therapeutic, and possibly also prognostic relevance. To investigate the effects of short-term selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blockade in nonobese normotensive humans on glucose and lipoprotein homeostasis, we assessed SI (determined by the minimal model method of Bergman), before and after glucose load plasma, glucose, and insulin levels, serum total triglycerides and lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, and some other variables in 20 healthy young men (26 +/- 1 years old, mean +/- SEM) during placebo and after 5 weeks of terazosin administration at a dose up to 10 mg once daily. Measurements were made after 3 days of standard diet (2,500 kcal/day, 45% carbohydrates, 40% fat, and 15% proteins) and after an overnight fast. Compared to placebo, terazosin decreased the upright systolic blood pressure (placebo vs. terazosin: 125 +/- 2 vs. 117 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and increased supine (63 +/- 2 vs. 70 +/- 1 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and upright (77 +/- 2 vs. 88 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01) heart rates, while the body weight was unaltered. Terazosin did not significantly modify fasting plasma glucose (5.08 +/- 0.09 vs. 5.23 +/- 0.08 mmol/L, respectively), or insulin (8.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.6 +/- 0.6 microU/ml), SI (14.3 +/- 1.8 vs 11.8 +/- 1.5 x 10(-4)/min/microU/ml), the areas under the insulin or glucose curves, serum total triglycerides, and cholesterol or lipoprotein cholesterol fractions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The genetically inbred cardiomyopathic Syrian hamster provides a valuable model of congestive cardiomyopathy: myocytolytic necrosis at 30-50 days of age is followed by cardiac hypertrophy at 150-250 days, and finally by congestive failure and death at 250-350 days. Successful drug treatment has been reported in the prenecrotic stage, but not when started during congestive failure. The present study evaluated survival of the cardiomyopathic hamster treated with the new beta-adrenoceptor blocker nebivolol, which was initiated during congestive failure. Fifty animals (BIO82.62, either sex, age 200 days) were acclimated to an environmentally controlled room for 20 days, receiving food and water ad libitum; seven hamsters died, indicating development of congestive failure. The remaining animals were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: 15 animals received control food; food for the others was supplemented with nebivolol, yielding a daily intake of either 0.1 mg/kg (n = 14) or 1 mg/kg (n = 14). At the lower nebivolol dose, death rate was unaltered in comparison with controls. However, at 1 mg/kg, survival was markedly improved (p = 0.042). Nebivolol treatment, started during congestive failure, thus significantly delays mortality in the cardiomyopathic hamster.", 
    "80": "1. In rat isolated islets of Langerhans the selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clenbuterol (1 to 20 microM), significantly increased the level of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) within 2 min of incubation. 2. The cyclic AMP response to clenbuterol was inhibited in the presence of the selective beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, ICI 118551 (0.1 or 10 microM) but remained unchanged when the beta 1-antagonist, atenolol (0.1 microM) was administered. 3. Despite causing an elevation in cyclic AMP, clenbuterol (up to 20 microM) failed to influence insulin secretion at any glucose concentration tested, even in the presence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. 4. By contrast, clenbuterol elicited a dose-dependent rise in the rate of glucagon secretion; the maximal agonist-induced increase in secretion was two fold, a response equivalent to that observed with 20 mM L-arginine. 5. ICI 118551 significantly inhibited the rise in glucagon secretion induced by clenbuterol (up to 20 microM). 6. The results indicate that the rat islet A cell population is equipped with functional beta 2-adrenoceptors which influence glucagon secretion via the second messenger cyclic AMP, but that the B cells are deficient in functional beta-receptors.", 
    "81": "The mechanisms by which noradrenaline, lipolytic agents and long-chain fatty acids stimulate glucose transport were investigated in rat brown adipocytes. Glucose transport was evaluated with tracer D-[U-14C]glucose and cell respiration was measured polarographically. Noradrenaline increased basal oxygen consumption (8-10-fold) and glucose transport (4-5-fold) in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal stimulation at 100 nM. The stimulatory effects of noradrenaline on respiration and glucose transport were selectively mimicked by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, cholera toxin and physiological concentrations of palmitic acid. Cytochalasin B completely blocked the effects of these agents on glucose transport. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol inhibited noradrenaline-induced glucose transport, but did not affect the action of DBcAMP, palmitic acid or cholera toxin on this process. The specific inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase, 2-tetradecylglycidic acid (McN 3802) (50 microM), inhibited the stimulatory effects of noradrenaline (100 nM) and palmitic acid (0.5 mM) on both glucose transport and mitochondrial respiration. Significantly, McN 3802 failed to affect insulin (1 nM) action under identical experimental conditions. These results demonstrate that (a) the stimulatory effects of noradrenaline on brown-adipocyte respiration and glucose transport can be dissociated from those induced by insulin, and (b) noradrenaline increases glucose transport indirectly, by activating adenylate cyclase via beta-adrenergic pathways and by stimulating mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acids.", 
    "82": "The cyclic AMP content of cat carotid bodies in vitro measured with a radioimmunoassay under control conditions (PO2: 230 torr) was 0.79 +/- 0.10 pmol/carotid body (n = 10). Lowering medium PO2 to 20 torr for 2 min significantly increased cyclic AMP content to 1.13 +/- 0.14 pmol/carotid body (n = 10). This increase was inhibited neither by propranolol (34 microM) nor by propranolol plus haloperidol (27 microM). Inhibition of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (0.8 mM) provoked a fast and large increase in cyclic AMP during both control and hypoxic conditions. The cyclic AMP increase induced by hypoxia was still observed when extracellular Ca2+ was absent. Inhibition of the adenylate cyclase by N-(cis-2-phenylcyclopentyl)azacyclotridecan-2-imine hydrochloride (MDL 12330A; 20-1,000 microM) under zero-Ca2+ conditions irreversibly inhibited the cyclic AMP increase produced by hypoxia. Similarly, inhibition of the Ca2(+)-calmodulin complex by trifluoperazine (0.2 mM) or calmidazolium (R 24571; 50-200 microM) prevented the cyclic AMP response. These results suggest that cyclic AMP may be involved in the PO2-sensing mechanism of the carotid body. Hypoxia appears to activate adenylate cyclase directly and independent of any hormone-receptor interactions.", 
    "83": "Long-term beta-blocker therapy may be useful in some patients affected by chronic heart failure. In a group of 15 patients with chronic heart failure of different origin we evaluated clinical, hemodynamic and neurohormonal features after 1 year of therapy. All patients were treated with atenolol at dosage of 50 mg/die. We observed a better ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography after 1 year of treatment. There was an increase of exercise time and VO2 max evaluated by cycloergometer test. There was a decrease of mean pulmonary artery pressure, of pulmonary vascular resistance and of right atrial pressure. Plasmatic norepinephrine decreased from 1294 +/- 568 to 574 +/- 33 pg/l. Our results suggest that patients who well tolerated chronic beta-blockade show an improvement of performance parameters.", 
    "84": "Eighteen rats were trained on a multiple schedule: lever pressing was rewarded on a Variable Interval (VI 20 s) in both components but, in addition, punished on a similar schedule in one. Shock intensity was individually adjusted to produce high or low degrees of response suppression during punishment periods in two different groups of animals. For some rats in each group, punishment periods were signalled by a flashing light; for others, by a steady light. d,l-Propranolol (2.5-7.5 mg/kg), l-propranolol (3.75, 7.5 mg/kg) and atenolol (20 mg/kg) released responding in animals in which suppression was low. These effects were restricted to the group for which the punishment signal was flashing light. The results are consistent with the view that activation of peripheral beta-adrenoceptors is involved in the suppression of responding by signals of punishment, but only in some conditions. Adding chlordiazepoxide (3.75 mg/kg) to d,l-propranolol (7.5 mg/kg) increased punished responding in the high-suppression group, but reduced it in the low-suppression group.", 
    "85": "The antiarrhythmic effects and pharmacodynamics of tobanum were evaluated in 28 patients wist paroxysms of reciprocal atrioventricular tachycardia, by using transesophageal cardiac pacing. The agent given in a single dose of 10 mg produced antiarrhythmic effects in 70% patients with paroxysms of atrioventricular nodal tachycardia and in 40% with atrioventricular tachycardia in the presence of the Wolff--Parkinson-White syndrome. After administration of the drug, its antiarrhythmic effect occurred on an average 1.5 h and retained for 27 h.", 
    "86": "Experiments were carried out to characterize the adenosine-induced negative inotropic effect in relation to the extent of beta-adrenoceptor activation in the isolated dog left ventricular myocardium. Adenosine and R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine inhibited the positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline (10(-7) mol/l and lower) about 20% of its maximal response, which was antagonized by an A1 adenosine receptor antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine in a concentration-dependent manner. The negative inotropic effect of adenosine disappeared and that of R-N6-phenylisopropyl-adenosine decreased when the isoprenaline concentration was elevated to the level higher than 10(-7) mol/l. Adenosine deaminase (1.5 U/ml) that abolished the negative inotropic effect of adenosine enhanced the effect of R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, indicating that endogenous adenosine released by high isoprenaline concentration (10(-6) mol/l) modulates the interaction. The maximal response to adenosine and R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine determined in the presence of 10(-7) mol/l isoprenaline was 50% of that of carbachol which elicited the maximal inhibition even in the presence of 10(-6) mol/l isoprenaline. The negative inotropic effects of R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine and carbachol were additive to the maximal response equivalent to that of carbachol. The difference in the efficiency between the adenosine and muscarinic receptor agonists may be partly ascribed to the difference in densities of the respective receptors in the dog ventricular myocardium. The negative inotropic effect of R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine in the presence of isoprenaline was associated with decrease in cyclic AMP levels elevated previously by isoprenaline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "The effects of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline were studied on isolated preparations of kitten heart. To define the contribution of beta 1-adrenoceptors (beta 1AR) and beta 2-adrenoceptors (beta 2AR) we used as tools the highly beta 1AR-selective antagonist CGP 20,712 A and non-linear analysis of antagonism. The beta 2AR-mediated responses to the catecholamines, disclosed by CGP 20,712 A, were verified by blockade with the beta 2AR-selective ICI 118,551. The relative density and contribution of beta 1AR and beta 2AR to (-)-adrenaline- and (-)-noradrenaline-induced adenylyl cyclase stimulation was also estimated in right ventricular membranes. 1. In the sinoatrial pacemaker (-)-adrenaline caused positive chronotropic effects through both beta 1AR and beta 2AR while (-)-noradrenaline does so predominantly through beta 1AR. During beta 1AR blockade (-)-adrenaline did cause the same maximum effects through beta 2AR as (-)-noradrenaline did through beta 1AR. 2. In left atria (-)-adrenaline caused positive inotropic effects predominantly through beta 1AR. CGP 20,712 A also uncovered a beta 2AR component at high (-)-adrenaline concentrations comprising one third of the maximum beta 1AR-mediated response. 3. Receptor binding assays revealed that 80% of right ventricular beta AR were beta 1AR and 20% beta 2AR. Consistent with this finding, around 80% of the adenylyl cyclase stimulation by both (-)-noradrenaline and (-)-adrenaline was mediated through beta 1AR, around 20% through beta 2AR. The positive inotropic effects of (-)-noradrenaline appeared to be nearly exclusively mediated through beta 1AR in right ventricular papillary muscles. 4. The positive inotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline were quite variable with regard to beta 1AR and beta 2AR in right ventricular papillary muscles. Although beta 1AR-mediated effects are predominant in many muscles with only a small contribution of beta 2AR, in some muscles beta 2AR mediated around 50% of the maximum effect elicited through beta 1AR. In 3 out of 17 muscles beta 2AR mediated the same maximum effect of (-)-adrenaline as beta 1AR. 5. On occasion, we found marked beta AR heterogeneity amongst two muscles from the same right ventricle. One muscle only exhibited beta 1AR-mediated effects of (-)-adrenaline whereas in the other muscle maximal effects could be elicited through beta 2AR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "88": "Radiotracer techniques capable of measuring norepinephrine clearance and spillover rate into plasma were used to test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive effects of propranolol and atenolol in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats are associated with an inhibition of norepinephrine release from postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The 10%-15% fall in mean arterial pressure produced over 4 h by propranolol (1, 3.3 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) and atenolol (1, 3.3 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) was not dose-related, and only the largest dose of propranolol caused a significant bradycardia. Each dose of atenolol significantly lowered heart rate. The decrease in blood pressure caused by propranolol and atenolol was not related to the decrease in heart rate. Both propranolol and atenolol inhibited norepinephrine clearance by 12% to 16%. The 1 mg/kg doses of propranolol and atenolol significantly suppressed norepinephrine spillover rate by 21% and 32%, respectively, at 4 h postinjection. As the dose of propranolol was increased, the inhibition of norepinephrine spillover was reversed as plasma epinephrine concentration rose by 125%. The suppression of norepinephrine spillover rate caused by atenolol was more persistent but did diminish after the 10 mg/kg dose, when plasma epinephrine concentration was elevated by 55%. Both drugs suppressed plasma renin concentration, but the inhibition of norepinephrine spillover rate by propranolol and atenolol was not related to the fall in plasma renin concentration. By comparison, treatment with the adrenergic neuron blocking agent bretylium (5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg, s.c.) elicited a dose-related vasodepression with no change in heart rate or plasma renin concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "89": "Adult Wistar male rats underwent immobilization stress (IS) during forty minutes. PRL secretion presented a remarkable increase after 5 minutes, and it was higher than pre-stress values during the entire duration of the experiment. The blockade of beta-1 adrenoceptors by icv injections of practolol did not modify IS-induced PRL release. IPS 339, a selective antagonist of beta-2 adrenoceptors, also injected icv, reduced PRL secretion during stress in a dose dependent fashion. The blockade of PRL secretion due to IPS 339 was reverted by a previous icv administration of salbutamol, a classical beta-2 agonist. The data presented here suggest that central beta-2 adrenoceptors activation is an important step in the control of stress-induced PRL secretion.", 
    "90": "The effects of d-sotalol and the sea anemone toxin ATXII on the electrophysiological properties of rat and guinea-pig ventricular myocardium in vitro and on arrhythmias following coronary artery ligation in rat hearts in vivo were studied. ATXII (1-5 nM) prolonged the cardiac action potential of isolated papillary muscles and the effective refractory period of perfused hearts from both rats and guinea-pigs. In rat hearts, ATXII induced gross action potential prolongation and early afterdepolarizations at concentrations above 1 nM. In contrast, d-sotalol prolonged the action potential and effective refractory period of guinea-pig, but not of rat myocardium. Neither drug prevented arrhythmias in anaesthetized rats following coronary ligation.", 
    "91": "The antihypertensive effects of tertatolol, a new non-cardioselective beta-blocking drug, were investigated in 20 patients with mild to moderate primary arterial hypertension, in a placebo controlled double blind randomized study. After tertatolol 5 mg o.d. significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in heart rate were observed at rest (BP from 155/103 +/- 3/1 to 139/91 +/- 4/3 mmHg p less than 0.01; HR from 79 +/- 2 to 60 +/- 2 bpm p less than 0.01). Peak blood pressure, heart rate and myocardial O2 consumption, indirectly measured as cardiac workload, determined during adrenergic stimulation by 70 degrees head-up tilt, cold pressor test, mental arithmetic stress, isometric exercise and bicycle exercise were also reduced by 4 weeks of tertatolol treatment in comparison to pretreatment levels. No significant changes in the same parameters were induced by placebo. No side effects were observed during treatment."
