Airway reactivity was assessed by measuring changes in SRaw upon increasing ACh infusion. We found that propranolol treatment increased reactivity to parenteral ACh, but did not change baseline SRaw. Furthermore, propranolol reduced the range in muscarinic reactivity for the group, and it enhanced thr reproducibility of measurements in individual animals. In contrast, indomethacin had no effect on either baseline SRaw or muscarinic reactivity. Our results suggest that beta-blockade of endogenous adrenergic stimulation increases the muscarinic reactivity of guinea pig airways, but does not influence resting airway tone. It appears that propranolol treatment allows a more reproducible assessment of muscarinic reactivity in the guinea pig. In contrast, cyclooxygenase products do not seem to significantly affect baseline airway resistance, reactivity, or reproducibility in the guinea pig.", 
    "1": "Activation of beta-adrenergic receptors on astrocytes in primary cell culture results in the release of taurine, an inhibitory transmitter. Taurine release occurs via a cyclic AMP-mediated intracellular pathway, because (a) taurine release and intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation have similar pharmacologies and time courses of activation and (b) N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulates release with a time course similar to that observed with the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol. These results describe a previously unrecognized physiological function of astrocytes in the CNS-receptor-mediated release of the neuroactive amino acid taurine. This observation indicates that astrocytes may function as local regulators of neuronal activity.", 
    "2": "The adrenergic receptors of rat pineal gland were investigated using radiolabeled ligand binding and photoaffinity labeling techniques. 125I-2-[beta-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone (125I-HEAT) and 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP) labeled specific sites on rat pineal gland membranes with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of 48 (+/- 5) pM and 30 (+/- 5) pM, respectively. Binding site maxima were 481 (+/- 63) and 1,020 (+/- 85) fmol/mg protein. The sites labeled by 125I-HEAT had the pharmacological characteristics of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. 125I-CYP-labeled beta-adrenergic receptors were characterized as a homogeneous population of beta 1-adrenergic receptors. The alpha 1- and beta 1-adrenergic receptors were covalently labeled with the specific photoaffinity probes 4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2-(4-[5-(4-azido-3-[125I]iodophenyl) pentanoyl]-1-piperazinyl) quinazoline (125I-APDQ) and 125I-p-azidobenzylcarazolol (125I-pABC). 125I-APDQ labeled an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor peptide of Mr = 74,000 (+/- 4,000), which was similar to peptides labeled in rat cerebral cortex, liver, and spleen. 125I-pABC labeled a single beta 1-adrenergic receptor peptide with a Mr = 42,000 (+/- 1,500), which differed from the 60-65,000 peptide commonly seen in mammalian tissues. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.", 
    "3": "Ketanserin (K), a selective and specific S2-receptor antagonist, has been compared with metoprolol (M), a cardioselective beta-blocker, in a double-blind study in order to assess its efficacy and safety in the treatment of essential hypertension. After a placebo run-in period of 4 weeks, hypertensive patients [supine diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 100 mmHg] were treated with K, 40 mg twice daily (n = 18), or with M, 100 mg twice daily (n = 14). Systolic pressure (SBP) and DBP, both supine and standing, were significantly reduced from the first month of treatment by both drugs and remained stable for the whole study period (12 weeks). About two-thirds of the patients treated with K responded to the therapy (drop in DBP of at least 10%) and half were normalized (DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg). In the M group, 50% of patients responded and 30% were normalized. A significant decrease in the heart rate was observed with M, but not with K. Ten patients treated with K were followed for 1 year. The antihypertensive effect of K was maintained throughout the study with evidence of tolerance. No serious adverse reaction was observed.", 
    "4": "This study was designed to compare the antihypertensive effectiveness of ketanserin (K) and metoprolol (M) in a 3-month double-blind treatment, and to assess the long-term efficacy of K in a 1-year open trial. Twenty-four patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomly placed in two groups: group 1 (n = 11) received K, 40 mg/day, and group 2 (n = 13) received M, 200 mg/day. In the double-blind phase of treatment both K and M significantly lowered blood pressure (BP) (P less than 0.01). The heart rate was significantly decreased by M (P less than 0.01). In the 1-year follow-up, patients were divided into three groups: group I (n = 7) had been previously treated with K and maintained on K; group II (n = 4) was given K plus M (these patients had previously been treated with K, but K had failed to decrease diastolic BP to less than or equal to 90 mmHg); and group III (n = 13) was given K (previously these patients had been treated with M). In group I, the BP lowering effect remained constant throughout the 1-year follow-up. In group III, supine and standing diastolic BP decreased significantly after treatment with K (P less than 0.05). Side effects from K were minimal. Ketanserin appears to be a new alternative approach in the treatment of mild and moderate essential hypertension.", 
    "5": "The long-term safety and efficacy of ketanserin in the treatment of essential hypertension was assessed in monotherapy or in combination with the beta-blocker, metoprolol. In an initial double-blind phase, 40 patients were randomized and treated for 12 weeks with either ketanserin or metoprolol. When compared with baseline placebo values, both drugs were significantly effective in reducing blood pressure levels. The antihypertensive action of ketanserin was more gradual than that of metoprolol. The incidence of side-effects was lower with ketanserin: six cases of mild bradycardia were noted with the beta-blocker. Following this phase, all patients received ketanserin therapy during a 12-month period in an open study. Those patients not controlled by monotherapy [i.e. diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg] were treated by a combination of both drugs. Twenty-two patients receiving ketanserin monotherapy were successfully controlled for all of the period of observation [mean supine systolic blood pressure (SBP)/DBP = 142/88]. Side-effects were minimal, with no significant changes observed in biochemical or haematological measurements during the year-long open phase. The results of this study document the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of essential hypertension with ketanserin.", 
    "6": "In a randomized double-blind study with parallel design involving 20 hypertensive patients, the antihypertensive activity and effect on platelet function of ketanserin have been compared with those of atenolol. Patients in both treatment groups were matched for age, body weight, duration of hypertension and blood pressure values on placebo. After 12 weeks of oral treatment, both ketanserin and atenolol significantly reduced blood pressure from 183/113 and 187/111 mmHg, at the end of the placebo run-in period, to 159/91 and 169/99 mmHg, respectively (P less than 0.05). No significant differences were noted between the hypotensive effect of both drugs. In contrast to ketanserin, atenolol significantly reduced the heart rate after 12 weeks of therapy (P = 0.025). Ketanserin significantly inhibited serotonin-induced platelet aggregation and serotonin uptake by thrombocytes, whereas atenolol failed to alter these variables. The results indicate that the antihypertensive activity of the serotonin antagonist ketanserin is comparable with that of the beta-receptor blocker atenolol.", 
    "7": "The efficacy and tolerability of ketanserin was compared with metoprolol in a double-blind parallel group study. After a 4-week placebo run-in on no treatment patients with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) of 95 mmHg or more received ketanserin 40 mg (n = 16) or metoprolol 100 mg (n = 17) twice daily. Blood pressure was measured in duplicate using a Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer. Both blood pressure and heart rate were recorded after 5 min supine and 1 min standing. Patients visited after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial BPs, both supine and standing, were significantly reduced from week 2 by both treatments (P less than 0.05, Student's t-test). The mean (+/- s.e.m.) changes in supine BP at 3 months compared with baseline were -15.7 (3.6) mmHg systolic and -13.9 (2.7) mmHg diastolic in the ketanserin group and -26.6 (7.9) mmHg systolic and -15.2 (2.7) mmHg diastolic in the metoprolol group. There was a tendency for the fall in systolic BP to be greater in the metoprolol group, but this did not reach statistical significance except for the standing systolic BP at 1 month. Metoprolol caused a significant fall in heart rate compared with baseline values throughout the study, and the metoprolol group was significantly different from the ketanserin group at 2 months for the supine heart rate and at all time points for standing heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin (40 mg twice daily) and pindolol (5 mg twice daily) as monotherapy were compared in a crossover, double-blind trial in 17 patients with essential hypertension. Both ketanserin and pindolol decreased supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly (P less than 0.01 for systolic and P less than 0.001 for diastolic) when evaluated at the end of the 2-month treatment periods. There was no significant difference between the two drugs. No significant changes in heart rate were observed on either drug. Both drugs were well tolerated.", 
    "9": "Ketanserin is a new potent antiserotonergic drug which, unlike previous ones, is selective for S2-serotoninergic receptors and does not have an agonist action. A trial was carried out on medium-term treatment with ketanserin or propranolol in subjects suffering from mild to moderate hypertension. The trial was designed as a double-blind crossover randomized study comparing either ketanserin or propranolol with placebo. Thirteen patients completed the study, which was divided into two groups (A and B). Systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean (MBP) blood pressures were measured by non-invasive, intermittent ambulatory monitoring performed using a Pressurometer II, from Del Mar Avionics. Heart rate was measured using a continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced both after ketanserin (A:11.1%; B:10.8%) and propranolol (A:11.7%; B:11.8%) but in group A its decrease was more pronounced after propranolol (P less than 0.01). Diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced both after ketanserin (A:11.5%; B:11.1%) and propranolol (A:11.4%; B:11.9%), as was MBP (A:11.9%; B:11.8% for ketanserin and A:11.9%; B:11.9% for propranolol). The heart rate diminished significantly only after propranolol administration (P less than 0.01). Ambulatory monitoring showed a significant 24-h reduction of SBP after administration of propranolol (P less than 0.0025) and ketanserin (A:P less than 0.0025, B: P less than 0.005). Diastolic blood pressure was also significantly reduced after ketanserin (P less than 0.0005) and propranolol (A: P less than 0.0025, B: P less than 0.0005). The heart rate obtained by continuous electrocardiogram monitoring diminished significantly only after propranolol administration (P less than 0.0005). No significant changes of circadian behaviour of blood pressure were observed.", 
    "10": "The administration of oxotremorine together with methylatropine to rats produces a dose-dependent increase of adrenal dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activity. This effect is abolished by denervation of the gland and by cycloheximide. The Km for tyramine is not affected by the trans-synaptic induction of DBH by oxotremorine. The induction is selective, because similar treatment does not affect adrenal dopa decarboxylase or lactate dehydrogenase in the adrenal gland. The combination of 6-hydroxydopamine i.c.v. or propranolol i.p. does not alter the effect of oxotremorine on adrenal DBH. However, propranolol reduces the tremorigenic action of the muscarinic agonist. The systemic administration of p-chlorophenylalanine or the i.c.v. injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine before oxotremorine treatment does not affect the increase of adrenal DBH. Progabide, gamma-aminobutyric acid, a (GABA)A and GABAB receptor agonist that effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, reduces the effect of oxotremorine in a dose-dependent manner. Muscimol given by either of two routes, i.c.v. at a constant rate (Alzet minipump) or i.p., produces significant decreases of adrenal DBH activity and attenuates the action of oxotremorine. Denervation of the gland abolishes the effect of muscimol i.p. in decreasing adrenal DBH activity. Baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, has no effect by itself or does it affect the action of oxotremorine. None of these GABA agonists has any in vitro effect on adrenal DBH activity. Bicuculline, GABAA receptor antagonist, reverses the action of progabide in oxotremorine-treated rats with respect to adrenal DBH activity, partially blocks the effect of muscimol and enhances the increase obtained with oxotremorine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "The effects of pindolol were studied on the large arteries, arterioles, and veins of the forearm in 13 patients with essential hypertension after 12 weeks of dosing. The methods used were pulsed Doppler velocimetry of the brachial artery and strain gauge mercury-in-silicone rubber plethysmography of the forearm. Compared with placebo baseline values, chronic pindolol significantly decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P less than 0.001), pulse pressure (P less than 0.001), and pulse rate (P less than 0.05). A significant increase was observed in brachial artery diameter (P less than 0.01), brachial artery blood flow and velocity (P less than 0.001), and forearm arterial flow (P less than 0.001). Forearm vascular resistance and venous tone were decreased (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.05, respectively), whereas forearm arterial compliance was increased (P less than 0.001). These results demonstrate a dilatory effect on large and small peripheral arteries and on veins of pindolol after chronic dosing, which leads to improvement in the conduction and buffering arterial function of the forearm.", 
    "12": "In an open crossover comparison of propranolol and nitrendipine, 19 patients with hypertension received 40 to 160 mg propranolol and 5 to 20 mg nitrendipine twice a day. Mean (+/- SD) predose supine blood pressure fell from 145/98 +/- 11/7 to 132/88 +/- 12/8 mm Hg with propranolol and to 135/92 +/- 11/9 mm Hg with nitrendipine. Resting heart rate was reduced by propranolol but was unchanged 12 hours after nitrendipine dosing. Neither propranolol nor nitrendipine altered plasma glucose or insulin after oral glucose. Propranolol significantly increased fasting triglyceride levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but nitrendipine induced no change. Propranolol reduced and nitrendipine increased plasma renin activity after exercise. Peak plasma nitrendipine levels were dose proportional and occurred at 1 to 2 hours after dosing, whereas peak blood pressure reductions occurred 4 hours after the last dose of nitrendipine and were associated with mean increases in heart rate. Nitrendipine is almost equivalent in hypotensive effect to propranolol, but nitrendipine increases plasma renin activity after exertion and may produce transient tachycardia. However, nitrendipine does not cause unwanted metabolic effects.", 
    "13": "In 16 patients undergoing angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the clinical, electrocardiographic, and hemodynamic effects of short-term intravenous nonselective beta-adrenergic blockade with propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) were assessed during temporary occlusion of the artery. Myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion was prevented, delayed in onset, or diminished in magnitude by propranolol in 10 of the 16 patients. Propranolol decreased values for indexes of myocardial oxygen demand, such as heart rate and blood pressure and their product, in all patients. Surprisingly, in patients who derived clinical benefit, propranolol did not change indexes of myocardial oxygen supply to the left ventricular region perfused by the occluded artery. For example, great cardiac vein flow (40 +/- 15 to 41 +/- 17 ml/min, p = NS) and coronary collateral resistance (2.1 +/- 1.0 to 2.1 +/- 1.1 mm Hg/ml/min, p = NS) were unchanged. In contrast, a worsening of supply occurred in patients who were not benefited: great cardiac vein flow (50 +/- 10 to 39 +/- 6 ml/min, p less than .05) decreased and coronary collateral resistance (1.6 +/- 0.5 to 2.0 +/- 0.6 mm Hg/ml/min, p less than .05) increased. Information obtained from this study demonstrates the value of this new experimental preparation in helping assess potential clinical effectiveness of drug interventions during the initial phase of acute coronary occlusion and providing insight into the mechanisms of drug effect.", 
    "14": "This study aimed at comparing the effects of blockade or stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors on the head-twitch response induced in mice by direct (5-MeODMT) or indirect (5-HTP) activation of serotonergic receptors shows that: beta-agonists (clenbuterol and salbutamol) increased the 5-HTP-induced head-twitches and decreased the response to 5-MeODMT. beta-agonists (propranolol and penbutolol) reduced the head-twitches elicited by 5-HTP but enhanced those induced by 5-MeODMT. Under our experimental conditions, desipramine behaved like the beta-agonists studied. Prior intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-DHT enhanced the response to 5-MeODMT but did not prevent the antagonism of clenbuterol against 5-MeODMT-induced head-twitches. These findings suggest that beta-receptors are in a position to regulate differentially serotonin transmission.", 
    "15": "Contractile response to exogenous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was studied in auricles from normal and acutely-diabetic (streptozotocin-treated) rats. In normal atria, PGE2 induced a biphasic inotropic effect negative at low concentrations and positive at higher ones. In diabetic, PGE2 only elicited a positive inotropic action which was greater in efficacy and potency than in normal controls. Incubation of diabetic atrial preparations with alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (phentolamine, phenoxybenzamine or Prazosin) diminished the prostaglandin effect. However, blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol did not modify the response. Blockers of arachidonic acid metabolism via cyclo-oxygenase (indomethacin and acetylsalicylic acid) or via lipoxygenase(s) (nordihydroguaiaretic acid and dithizone) were able to reduce the positive inotropism of PGE2. A significant blockade of the stimulant action of PGE2 was seen in the presence of inhibitors of thromboxane synthesis (L-8027 and imidazole). These results suggest that in diabetic atria PGE2 effect could be associated to an involvement of cardiac alpha-adrenergic stimulation which promotes endogenous arachidonic acid release with diversification of its metabolism towards cyclo- and lipoxygenase(s)- pathway and direct to an increased thromboxane formation which could account for the positive inotropic effect induced by PGE2.", 
    "16": "The role of sinoatrial beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors mediating positive chronotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline and (-)-noradrenaline was investigated in rat right atria. Concentration effect curves for (-)-adrenaline, but not for (-)-noradrenaline, became biphasic in the presence of the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712 A. The curves for (-)-adrenaline in the presence of 300 nmol/l CGP 20712 A (equivalent to 1,000 times its KB, KB = 0.3 nmol/l for beta 1-adrenoceptors) comprise a high-sensitivity component that saturates at 1/4 of maximum effect, and a low sensitivity component. The high-sensitivity component is blocked by the beta 2-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist ICI 118,551. These results are consistent with an involvement in the rat of both beta 1-adrenoceptors (to a major extent) and beta 2-adrenoceptors [only at high (-)-adrenaline concentrations] in the positive chronotropic effects of (-)-adrenaline. (-)-Noradrenaline appears to activate mostly rat sinoatrial beta 1-adrenoceptors.", 
    "17": "Histamine and serotonin uptake in isolated rat mast cells is decreased in the presence of betaadrenoceptor blocking (BAB) drugs. Such inhibition is dose-dependent and is evidently higher for the inhibition of serotonin uptake. The most potent drugs were the highly lipophilic compounds K\u00f6 1124 and propranolol. No difference was found among the various BAB drugs in their ability to decrease histamine uptake. It is evident from the ratio between histamine and serotonin liberation on one side, to the uptake of both amines in mast cells on the other side, that with the exception of K\u00f6 1124, all investigated BAB drugs possesses higher inhibition of extracellular amine uptake in comparison with histamine and serotonin liberation. Such an effect might be a result of a primary interaction of BAB drugs with mast cells at the plasma membrane.", 
    "18": "A sensitive, specific, reproducible, and convenient high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay was developed for quantitation of the new ultra short acting beta-adrenergic antagonist, flestolol (1), in whole blood. The instability of the compound in blood was overcome by the esterase inhibitor, NaF, and deproteinization of blood samples with CH3CN:CH2Cl2 (2:5). The internal standard was p-ethoxyphenethyl alcohol. The compounds were back extracted from the CH3CN:CH2Cl2 phase into a small volume of pH 3-4 phosphate buffer and then separated on a reversed-phase C18 column with 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 3-4) in acetonitrile (4.6:1) as the mobile phase, and detected with an UV detector at 229 nm. The assay was linear with a blood concentration range from 10 to 1270 ng/mL (r2 greater than 0.998, p greater than 0.01), and reproducible with an overall CV of 8%. The assay procedure was used to determine the blood levels of flestolol intravenously infused into a male dog for 105 min at 230 micrograms/kg/min. The steady-state unchanged drug concentration of 5 micrograms/mL in blood was achieved within 10-20 min and declined biexponentially to 0.02 microgram/mL at 6 h following termination of the infusion.", 
    "19": "The beta-adrenergic receptors of isolated human fat cells were identified using a new hydrophilic beta-adrenergic radioligand (+/-)[3H]CGP-12177. The results were compared with those from [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to fat cells and membranes. [3H]CGP-12177 binding to isolated fat cells showed lower nonspecific binding (less than 15% of total binding) than the lipophilic [3H]dihydroalprenolol (40-60%) at 3 times the KD. At 37 degrees C, [3H]CGP-12177 binding was rapid, reversible, of high affinity (1.2 +/- 0.3 nM) and saturable. The total number of binding sites per cell in subcutaneous adipocytes was 25,000 +/- 6,000 and was equivalent to that found using membrane fractions. Displacement of [3H]CGP-12177 bound to adipocytes by propranolol was stereoselective, consistent with competition at a single site, and had the same characteristics as in membranes. The displacement curves of the beta 1-selective antagonists (atenolol and betaxolol) were biphasic, the high affinity displacement accounting for 70% of the total binding sites. Beta-adrenergic agonists also competed with [3H]CGP-12177 binding in the order of potency: (-) isoproterenol greater than (-) norepinephrine greater than (-) epinephrine, similar to that found in membranes and in in vitro studies on the lipolytic activity of isolated fat cells. This study demonstrates that the sites specifically labeled by [3H]CGP-12177 are the physiological beta-adrenoceptors and also shows that the ligand is better than [3H]dihydroalprenolol for the accurate identification of these receptors in intact human adipocytes. The methodology, which requires biopsies of less than 1 gram of adipose tissue, can be of potential interest for clinical studies investigating the status of fat cell beta-adrenoceptors in various pathophysiological situations.", 
    "20": "A 15 min reduction in blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery to 35% of baseline in open chest anaesthetised pigs produced a 25% decrease in cardiac output and a similar fall in maximum left ventricular dP/dt, whereas left ventricular filling pressure increased from 10(1) to 14(1) mmHg. The decrease in perfusion of the myocardial area nourished by the left anterior descending coronary artery was not evenly distributed since the endocardial to epicardial flow ratio decreased from 0.93(0.07) to 0.48(0.06). Regional myocardial wall thickening of the ischaemic segment decreased from 0.36(0.03) to 0.14(0.03), whereas the arterial-coronary venous differences in pH and PCO2 tripled. Subsequently, eight animals received 1.5 mg X kg-1 of the cardioselective beta adrenoceptor antagonist bevantolol, whereas seven other animals were treated with the solvent. In the following 15 min the cardiovascular performance of the solvent treated animals did not change appreciably, although there was a tendency to further deterioration. Bevantolol did not improve transmural myocardial blood flow to the ischaemic zone but caused a redistribution in favour of the endocardial layers since the endocardial to epicardial flow ratio almost returned to baseline. These changes in flow were accompanied by a narrowing of the arterial-coronary venous differences in pH and PCO2, but regional myocardial function did not improve. In another series of experiments, however, bevantolol (1.5 mg X kg-1) decreased the velocity of regional wall thickening of normal myocardium by 22(2)% as a result of its negative inotropic properties. Thus bevantolol appears to alleviate ischaemia, and the increase in diastolic perfusion time (17%) may be one of the major mechanisms.", 
    "21": "Nipradilol (NP) was metabolized mainly in liver and denitrated and/or hydroxylated metabolites were formed. NP was not metabolized in heart or lung, and was stable in blood. Denitration of NP was catalysed mainly by glutathione-dependent organic nitrate reductase in liver cytosol, and the hydroxylation was catalysed by liver-microsomal enzymes. Denitration activity for NP was far lower than that for nitroglycerol and isosorbide dinitrate with liver homogenates of several animal species. A marked species difference was found in the denitration activity for NP; dog liver was especially low compared with rabbit, rat and mouse liver.", 
    "22": "Serum lipid levels were followed in myocardial infarction patients for one year after the infarction and related to their drug use and physical performance. Serum triglyceride concentrations were significantly elevated in patients using diuretics or diuretics and beta-blockers together both 3 and 12 months after the infarction when compared to patients not having drugs. The beta-blockers alone did not change triglycerides. No differences were found in total cholesterol concentration between any of the drug groups. The HDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in all the drug groups 12 months after the infarction in comparison with the group using no drugs, but 3 months after the infarction these differences were not present. Total work in the exercise stress test correlated negatively with serum triglycerides and total cholesterol and positively with HDL/total cholesterol ratio in the group using no drugs 12 months after the infarction. In beta-blocker users, total work correlated negatively with triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations. In all drug groups no correlation between total work and HDL/total cholesterol ratio could be found. These data suggest that despite differences in the physical working capacity between the groups, the drugs themselves are major determinants of differences in serum lipids.", 
    "23": "Nine different beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (BAA), five with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), were examined for their ability to inhibit isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) activity and specific 125I-cyanopindolol (CYP) binding in crude membrane particles from human myocardium. The BAA's were: propranolol, pindolol, timolol, alprenolol, metoprolol, atenolol, prenalterol, ICI 141.292 'Visacor', and ICI 118.587 'Corwin'. Whether BAAs with strong ISA were able to stimulate AC activity by themselves were examined in separate experiments and compared to the AC stimulation by full agonists. All the BAAs caused a concentration dependent, and at high doses apparently complete, inhibition of both isoproterenol-stimulated AC activity and 125I-CYP binding. Both assays made possible a 'potency-ranking' of the different BAAs (pindolol greater than or equal to propranolol and timolol greater than ICI 142.292 and alprenolol greater than ICI 118.587, prenalterol and metoprolol greater than atenolol). Corrected IC50-values, derived from inhibition curves with both techniques, show that receptor binding and inhibition of receptor function follow each other closely. Prenalterol caused a very weak AC activation (5.4% of maximum), whereas the 'ISA-blockers', pindolol, ICI 141.292, and ICI 118.587 were unable to stimulate AC activity at concentrations which completely displaced 125I-CYP binding. In comparison, norepinephrine stimulated AC activity to the same level as isoproterenol (three to four times basal activity) and the beta 2-selective agonist terbutaline caused some 50% of maximal AC stimulation. This raises the question whether ISA is due to AC activation. The effect upon AC activation and 125I-CYP binding of drugs with beta-selectivity shows that both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors are coupled to the AC.", 
    "24": "Previous studies have not defined the contribution of the splanchnic circulation to the total intravascular volume change associated with selective alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation. Since the splanchnic circulation is responsible for the total volume changes associated with other types of selective autonomic receptor stimulation, the present study was undertaken to examine the influence of alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation on splanchnic intravascular volume, the hemodynamic mechanism responsible for the splanchnic volume change, and the contribution of the splanchnic volume change to the change in total volume. In 35 anesthetized dogs, blood from the vena cavae was drained into an extracorporeal reservoir and returned to the right atrium at a constant rate so that changes in total intravascular volume could be measured as reciprocal changes in reservoir volume. Phenylephrine infusion (100 micrograms/min) for 20 min in 28 dogs was associated with a decrease in total volume of 64 +/- 17 (SEM) ml (P less than 0.0001). The response was abolished by either alpha adrenergic blockade or evisceration but was not attenuated by beta adrenergic blockade, sinoaortic baroreceptor denervation, ganglionic blockade, or splenectomy. In 5 animals with separate splanchnic perfusion and drainage, total and splanchnic volumes decreased 59 +/- 8 ml (P less than 0.0001) and 317 +/- 20 ml (P less than 0.0001), respectively, while transhepatic vascular resistance increased 17 +/- 4 cm H2O X min/l (P less than 0.0001). These responses were abolished after alpha adrenergic blockade. Thus, splanchnic volume decreases with alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation, despite an increase in hepatic resistance to splanchnic venous outflow. The splanchnic volume decrement is entirely responsible for the total volume decrement.", 
    "25": "The existence of facilitatory presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors has been shown in approximately 30 tissues of 6 different species including human. A positive feed back loop for further release of the transmitter appears to be activated by an endogenous agonist, epinephrine, taken up and released as a cotransmitter with norepinephrine rather than norepinephrine itself released from peripheral noradrenergic nerve terminals. Presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors are mainly of a beta 2-subtype. Some beta 1-subtype receptors are also suggested. There coexist presynaptic beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors in cat and rat hypothalamus. Higher sensitivity of peripheral presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors to isoproterenol may be implicated in the early development of hypertension in SHR. Epinephrine taken up and released initiates the development of hypertension in rats via activation of these receptors. Increased activation of these receptors by epinephrine may play a role in the development of essential hypertension. The antihypertensive action of beta-antagonists may be in part due to blockade of these facilitatory presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "26": "The effects of racemic propranolol and some related drugs on the intraocular pressure (IOP) were studied after topical application in rabbits. These drugs produced a significant reduction in IOP with the following order of potency: (-)-propranolol greater than timolol greater than (+/-)-propranolol greater than sotalol greater than (+)-propranolol greater than pranolium. Pretreatment of rabbit eyes with atropine significantly antagonized the ocular hypotensive action of (+/-)-propranolol, timolol and pranolium. Both (+/-)-propranolol and timolol produced a significant increase in pupil diameter in the presence of a submydriatic dose of atropine. The activities of monoamine oxidase and carbonic anhydrase were unaffected by (+/-)-propranolol, timolol and pranolium in-vitro. It is concluded from the results that both cholinergic and adrenergic mechanisms may be involved in the ocular hypotensive effects of the drugs.", 
    "27": "Tissue atenolol concentrations are high following chronic continuous beta-adrenoceptor blockade in dogs. Furthermore, significant concentrations of this poorly lipid soluble drug are found within the central nervous system after chronic dosing. It is suggested that all beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents may enter the central nervous system in significant and sufficient quantities to account for a central antihypertensive action of this group of compounds. Sequestration of beta-adrenoceptor agents in the CNS or other tissues may account for other clinically observed effects including adaptive effects.", 
    "28": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, compatibility and stability, dosage, and administration of esmolol hydrochloride are reviewed. Esmolol produces competitive blockade of beta receptors in both animals and humans. It does not possess membrane-stabilizing, intrinsic sympathomimetic, or alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. The relative cardioselectivity of esmolol is similar to that of metoprolol. Esterase metabolism accounts for the rapid total body clearance of 285 mL/kg/min and elimination half-life of 9.2 minutes. Its rapid metabolism following continuous intravenous infusion results in the rapid offset of pharmacologic effect after drug administration is discontinued. In patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, esmolol produces rapid control of heart rate in an average effective dosage range from 97.2 to 115.0 micrograms/kg/min and effects that are similar to propranolol. Esmolol is effective and safe in managing tachycardia and hypertension during surgical stress and may be useful in postoperative hypertension or elevated heart rates during myocardial ischemia. Esmolol does not appear to interact with digoxin, morphine, warfarin, or succinylcholine to any clinically important extent. The most frequent adverse effects associated with esmolol infusion are hypotension and phlebitis. Hypotension can be avoided by careful titration, and if encountered, it can be rapidly resolved by dosage adjustment or discontinuation of the infusion. The ultrashort half-life and duration of action of esmolol may allow safer application of beta blockade in critically ill patients.", 
    "29": "The rat isolated right atrium (frequency response) and progesterone-treated rat uterus (relaxation) were used to examine the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulatory effects of alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol. In addition, the beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulatory effect of practolol was studied in the right atrium. All the compounds studied caused a concentration-dependent increase in atrial frequency and relaxation of the uterus. The atrial response to pindolol was competitively inhibited by the beta 1-selective blocker pafenolol (10(-7) M), while the beta 2-selective blocker ICI 118551 (10(-8) M) was without effect. Pafenolol (10(-7) M) was also shown to inhibit the atrial frequency effect of alprenolol and oxprenolol. In the uterus, ICI 118551 (3 X 10(-9) M, 3 X 10(-8) M, 3 X 10(-7) M) blocked the pindolol effect with a pKB of 9.28. In addition, ICI 118551 (10(-8) M) competitively inhibited the relaxation of the uterus induced by alprenolol and oxprenolol. For alprenolol (right atrium and uterus), oxprenolol (right atrium), and pindolol (right atrium), the concentrations needed for half-maximal response were significantly greater than those required for occupation of half the receptors. This dissociation was most pronounced for pindolol in the right atrium. In this tissue, 80-85% of the beta 1-adrenoceptors had to be occupied by pindolol to initiate a tissue response corresponding to 50% of the maximal effect generated by the compound. The intrinsic activities of alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol (expressed as % of the maximal tissue response to isoprenaline) were significantly higher in the uterus than in the right atrium. The intrinsic activity of the compounds varied between individual preparations and, particularly in the uterus, correlated with the sensitivity of the tissue to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation by isoprenaline. 5 Calculation ofefficacy, relative to isoprenaline, of the partial beta-agonists revealed a beta 2-adrenoceptor selectivity for alprenolol (2.0), oxprenolol (1.4) and pindolol (3.0). 6 It is concluded that weak partial agonists such as alprenolol, oxprenolol and pindolol possess complex beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulatory properties in relation to beta-adrenoceptor occupancy and tissue sensitivity to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "30": "Basic cardiac electrophysiology and how it applies to antiarrhythmic drug therapy are reviewed. Normal impulse propagation through the heart proceeds in sequence from the sinoatrial (SA) node, through the atrial specialized conducting system, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the His-Pur-kinje system, and into the ventricles. The cardiac cell maintains a resting membrane potential until an electrical stimulus depolarizes the cell and generates an action potential. The action potential is composed of five phases that represent the changing ionic fluxes and membrane potentials of the cardiac cell. The heart contains two types of cardiac conducting fibers. The fast- and slow-current action potentials generated by these fiber types exhibit distinctly different electrophysiologic properties. Cardiac arrhythmias generally result from an abnormality in the rate, rhythm, or conduction of an electrical impulse in the heart. They may be described as disturbances in normal impulse initiation (automaticity), impulse conduction, or both. Various portions of the conduction system are under the control of the autonomic nervous system, which depends on the balance between the activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Intracellular and extracellular concentrations of potassium, calcium, and magnesium have important effects on the electrophysiology of the heart. These changes can be critical in the production of various arrhythmias or may affect the efficacy or toxicity of various antiarrhythmic agents. The electrophysiology of quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, lidocaine, tocainide, phenytoin, flecainide, amiodarone, and bretylium tosylate is discussed to detail the relationship between drug action and antiarrhythmic efficacy. The electrophysiologic effects of beta-blocking agents and calcium-channel antagonists are also presented. This basic primer on cardiac electrophysiology should provide the practitioner with an improved understanding of the effects, indications, and limitations of antiarrhythmic drugs.", 
    "31": "The insensitivity of Graves' thyroid to stimulation of cAMP formation by TSH as well as Graves' immunoglobulins in vitro is well known. The present study was performed to find out Graves' sera which may induce a final activation i.e. stimulation of T3 release in Graves' thyroid slices despite this insensitivity of tissue and to characterize determinants responsible for the efficiency of those sera. Out of 20 sera from patients with active untreated Graves' disease 6 were found to stimulate T3 release from Graves' thyroid in vitro. These 6 sera were effective in stimulating different Graves' glands, irrespective of pretreatment with propranolol, thiamazole (methimazole) or thiamazole plus iodine. In contrast, a significant response to bTSH was not observed in any Graves' gland. For comparison, 17/20 of the same sera were able to stimulate T3 release when tested on human goitrous thyroid. Sera which stimulated Graves' slices revealed no higher stimulating activities in goitrous tissue than serum samples which did not. All sera were additionally assessed for TSH binding inhibiting immunoglobulins in a radioreceptor assay. Remarkably, Graves' thyroid stimulating sera had a low or absent TSH binding inhibiting activity. Thus, hormone release from Graves' thyroid in vitro - in contrast to that from goitrous tissue - could only be activated by a minority of Graves' sera. These Graves' thyroid stimulating sera could be characterized to contain a selected spectrum of biologically active antibodies with a high TSH agonistic potency stimulating in the presence of a negligible TSH binding inhibiting activity.", 
    "32": "Two methods for determining pA2 values, the Schild regression and the use of the formula pA2 = pAx + log(x - 1), have been reassessed. The effects of propranolol on the contractile responses of the rat isolated right ventricle to isoprenaline were studied. The inhibitory effect with the lower concentrations of propranolol tested (3 X 10(-9) -10(-7) M) was solely competitive. Thus there was a parallel dextral displacement of the concentration-response curves to isoprenaline with no depression of the maximal responses. Dual antagonism was observed with the higher concentrations of propranolol tested (10(-6) and 3 X 10(-6) M), thereby showing a parallel displacement of the concentration-response curve to the lower concentrations of isoprenaline with a depression of the maximal responses. Without analysis of data for individual concentrations of propranolol on concentration-response curves to isoprenaline, Schild regression did not clearly illustrate that the antagonism was not solely competitive with the higher concentrations of propranolol. We suggest that data for individual concentrations of antagonist should always be analyzed to ascertain whether there has been a parallel shift of the concentration-response curves to agonist prior to determining pA2 values.", 
    "33": "In electrically driven guinea pig left atria, positive inotropic responses to (-)-isoprenaline and the selective beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist RO363 were obtained in the absence and in the presence of the functional antagonists adenosine, carbachol, gallopamil, nifedipine, and Ro 03-7894. Each of the functional antagonists reduced the maximum response to both agonists and produced nonparallel rightward shifts in the cumulative concentration effect curves. For both agonists, dissociation constants (KA) were calculated using the equation described by Furchgott (1966) for irreversible antagonism. For RO363, which is a partial agonist with high agonist activity, the equations outlined for functional interaction by Mackay (1981) were also employed to calculate KA values. The KA values obtained by each method were compared with the dissociation constants (KD) for the two agonists determined from their ability to displace the radioligand (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol from beta 1-adrenoceptors in guinea pig left atrial membrane preparations. The estimates of KA varied substantially from KD values. The KD values were taken as more accurate estimates of the true values for the dissociation constants because a high degree of correlation exists between pKD and pD2 values for a number of other beta-adrenoceptor agonists that behave as partial agonists and between pKD and pKB values for a number of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. Thus it appears that there are serious limitations in the current theory for using functional antagonism as a means of obtaining agonist dissociation constants.", 
    "34": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of the serotonin antagonist ketanserin and the post-synaptic alpha-blocker prazosin on blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Both drugs lower blood pressure by a reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance and by reducing the pre- and afterload, apparently achieving these haemodynamic effects through different mechanisms. Ketanserin appears to have a greater effect on afterload. Six men and four women (mean age 47.2 years) with diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mmHg were treated for 4 weeks with placebo and then randomized and treated for 8 weeks double-blind with either ketanserin or prazosin. A 4-week wash-out phase with placebo was then instituted followed by another 8 weeks of treatment in a crossover fashion with either ketanserin or prazosin. Blood pressure was measured on each occasion in the supine, sitting and standing positions. The results showed that both medications significantly lowered blood pressure (computed sitting values for all patients: ketanserin from 177/104 +/- 5/7 to 158/89 +/- 8/5 mmHg; prazosin from 176/103 +/- 11/8 to 156/88 +/- 6/4 mmHg). The data in this study show that ketanserin as an antihypertensive agent is as effective as prazosin, but in contrast requires no titration of dosage and better compliance can be expected with twice daily rather than three times daily dosing.", 
    "35": "The haemodynamic effects of ketanserin, a compound with S2-serotonergic receptor and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking properties, are reviewed in patients with essential hypertension. The drug has a definite antihypertensive action, both acutely and chronically, and its haemodynamic profile is similar to that of a vasodilator acting on both arterioles and veins but with its main action on arterioles. Its vasodilator action is associated with little reflex cardiostimulation. Pressor responses to i.v. phenylephrine are not altered by therapeutic i.v. doses of ketanserin but pressor responses to methoxamine, a compound that is more specific for vascular alpha 1-receptors than phenylephrine, have been reported to be reduced after chronic oral treatment with ketanserin. However, chronic ketanserin, unlike the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin in therapeutic doses, caused no parallel shift of the dose-pressor response curve of methoxamine and the shift was very small compared with prazosin. Studies in patients with autonomic failure and virtually no endogenous alpha 1-adrenergic tone have substantiated that ketanserin is capable of lowering blood pressure independently of alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade.", 
    "36": "The authors present data from four different institutions from open clinical trials of propranolol in 19 mentally retarded patients with IQs less than 50. When customary forms of treatment had failed, propranolol was initiated. A table showing changes in the patients' behavior is included. Twelve patients demonstrated a pronounced improvement in self-abusive and aggressive behavior, four made moderate gains, and three were considered unchanged. The authors postulate that at least some aspects of the behavioral improvement were due to the peripheral anxiolytic action of the beta-blockers. Contrary to other reports of using higher doses (greater than 520 mg/day range), the authors used a mean dose of 120 mg/day and consider the duration of time spent on the medication as a crucial factor in its effectiveness.", 
    "37": "To study the effects of cardiovascular fitness on hemodynamic responses to exercise during beta-adrenergic blockade (BAB), submaximal [60% of maximum O2 uptake (VO2max)] and maximal treadmill exercise data were collected in 11 trained (T, VO2max 63.3 ml X kg-1 X min-1, 26.8 yr) and 11 untrained (UT, VO2max 44.5 ml X kg-1 X min-1, 25.0 yr) male subjects. Subjects completed two maximal control tests followed by a randomized, double-blind series of maximal tests after 1-wk treatments with placebo (PLAC), propranolol (PROP, 160 mg/day, beta 1- and beta 2-blockade), and atenolol (ATEN, 100 mg/day, beta 1-blockade). Treatments were separated by 1-wk washout periods. At 60% of control VO2max T and UT subjects experienced no reductions in O2 uptake (VO2) with either drug. Submaximal heart rate (HR, beats/min) was 134.8 PLAC, 107.0 PROP, 107.9 ATEN (P less than 0.05 both drugs vs. PLAC) in T subjects and 141.1 PLAC, 106.1 PROP, and 105.0 ATEN (P less than 0.05 both drugs vs. PLAC) in UT subjects. Cardiac output (1/min) for T was 17.3 PLAC, 16.9 PROP, 16.5 ATEN (P less than 0.05 ATEN vs. PLAC in T only) and for UT it was 12.2 (PLAC), 11.7 (PROP), 11.5 (ATEN) (P less than 0.05 both drugs vs. PLAC in UT). Stroke volume increased from 129.8 ml (PLAC) to 158.6 (PROP) and 156.2 (ATEN) in T (P less than 0.05 both drugs vs. PLAC) and from 86.8 (PLAC) to 110.0 (PROP) and 109.8 (ATEN) (P less than 0.05 both drugs vs. PLAC) in UT. The increases in stroke volume (SV) were similar in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The use of various beta-adrenergic blockers has become extensive as they have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of a number of cardiovascular problems including cardiac arrhythmias, angina pectoris, and hypertension. The widespread and chronic use of these drugs has generated a concern for their potential chronic toxicity. Eighteen beta-adrenergic blockers have been reviewed and the available literature pertaining to their potential carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and teratogenicity has been summarized and compared.", 
    "39": "The involvement of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) in thermoregulatory responses, which include heat production and heat loss responses, was investigated by the method of electrical stimulation. Electrical stimulation of the VMH caused a rise in rectal temperature, accompanied by the enhancement of heat production: O2 consumption and shivering. In addition, a reduction in heat loss was observed, including decreases in skin temperature (Ts), respiratory rate, and body surface area resulting from a huddled posture. In this study, stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus and other regions near the VMH had no effect on thermoregulatory responses. beta-Blocker (propranolol, 1 mg/kg iv) injected 20 min before stimulation lessened O2 consumption by approximately 10% and attenuated the reduction in Ts during VMH stimulation, whereas alpha-blockade (phentolamine, 1 mg/kg iv) was ineffective. These results indicate that most of the increase in O2 consumption during VMH stimulation was due to the occurrence of shivering but that some component of it could be due to nonshivering thermogenesis. They also indicate that the VMH, either directly or by converging influences, is involved in the activation of thermoregulatory responses to cold stress.", 
    "40": "The potential neurotransmitter role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in cardioacceleratory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) nerves was examined in the guinea pig right atrium in vitro. In the presence of atropine, a muscarinic antagonist, and atenolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) of the isolated right atrium caused a positive chronotropic response, which is slow in both onset and decay. This TNS-induced slow response was assumed to be mediated by NANC nerves in the right atrium since tetrodotoxin inhibited the response. Dense distribution of CGRP-like immunoreactive (CGRP-I) nerves was demonstrated in the sinus node. Exogenously applied CGRP exerted a positive chronotropic effect on the isolated right atrium in a dose-dependent manner. Both CGRP-I nerves and NANC response induced by TNS were not affected by surgical sympathectomy and reserpine pretreatment but were abolished by the pretreatment of animals with capsaicin. The results suggest that CGRP is the neurotransmitter of cardioacceleratory NANC nerves in the right atrium of the guinea pig.", 
    "41": "Risk of sudden death was assessed in 533 patients who survived 10 days after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and were followed for up to 24 months (mean 18) in the Multicenter Investigation of the Limitation of Infarct Size. Analysis of clinical and laboratory variables measured before hospital discharge revealed that the QT interval, either corrected (QTc) or uncorrected for heart rate, did not contribute significantly to prediction of subsequent sudden death or total mortality. In this population, frequent ventricular premature complexes (more than 10 per hour) on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (radionuclide LV ejection fraction of 0.40 or less) identify patients at high risk of sudden death. In patients with these adverse clinical findings, the QTc was 0.468 +/- 0.044 second among those who died suddenly and 0.446 +/- 0.032 second in survivors, and was not statistically significant as an additional predictor of sudden death. Consideration of the use of type I antiarrhythmic agents, digoxin, presence of U waves and correction for intraventricular conduction delay did not alter these findings. Although QT-interval prolongation occurs in some patients after acute myocardial infarction, reduced LV ejection fraction and frequent ventricular premature complexes are the most important factors for predicting subsequent sudden death in this patient population.", 
    "42": "To assess the effect of beta blockade on left ventricular (LV) performance in patients with LV dysfunction and stable angina pectoris, 18 subjects taking a placebo followed by incremental doses of the cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent betaxolol (5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/day) were studied. The study ended with the achievement of optimal clinical beta blockade (heart rate at rest 50 to 60 beats/min, a 20% or smaller increase in heart rate during stage 1 of symptom-limited treadmill exercise using the modified Bruce protocol). Optimal clinical beta blockade produced a decrease in mean frequency of angina, from 6.8 +/- 1.7 to 0.7 +/- 0.8 episodes per week (p less than 0.0005) and an increase in mean treadmill exercise capacity, from 3.1 +/- 1.7 to 7.7 +/- 2.8 minutes (p less than 0.0005). LV systolic function was assessed at rest and during symptom-limited exercise with radionuclide left ventriculography. Mean LV ejection fraction (EF) during therapy with placebo was 39 +/- 7% at rest and 40 +/- 8% at peak exercise. Mean LVEF during optimal clinical beta blockade was 43 +/- 11% at rest and 45 +/- 10% at peak exercise. Neither of these changes was statistically significant. No patient had clinical or radiographic signs of LV failure. The results suggest that optimal clinical beta blockade with betaxolol, in doses sufficient to significantly reduce the frequency of angina and improve exercise capacity in patients with stable angina pectoris and mild to moderate LV systolic dysfunction, does not cause significant deterioration of LV systolic function or produce LV failure.", 
    "43": "The functional classification of the three types of cardiomyopathy has been helpful in organizing practitioners' thinking. The past three decades have witnessed tremendous advances in understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and treatment of these disorders. New doors of exploration are opening to answer such nagging questions as whether medical therapy alters long-term survival rates in dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy, whether immunologic therapy will alter the course of dilated or restrictive/obliterative cardiomyopathy, and whether genetic manipulation or in utero therapy will prevent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The goals of effective treatment in all these disorders remain the same: amelioration of symptoms, prevention of sudden death, and constraint or resolution of the basic disease process. Achieving these goals requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving cardiologists, surgeons, immunologists, geneticists, cell biologists, virologists, and pathologists. Prospects are that one day treatment will no longer be an imprecise, palliative art but a definitive, curative science.", 
    "44": "Hemodynamic responses to the selective stimulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors were examined in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. Norepinephrine (0.02-0.1 micrograms/kg/min), a mixed alpha-1/alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine (0.2-1.0 micrograms/kg/min), a selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist and B-HT 920 (0.5-2.0 micrograms/kg/min), a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, were infused i.v. after ganglionic (hexamethonium, 30 mg/kg i.v.), beta adrenoceptor (propranolol, 1, mg/kg i.v.) and muscarinic receptor (atropine methylbromide, 0.1 mg/kg i.v.) antagonism. Each of the alpha adrenoceptor agonists increased mean arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance but had no significant effect on cardiac output, stroke volume or heart rate. Equipressor doses of the alpha adrenoceptor agonists caused similar increases in left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, but there were no significant changes in left ventricular dP/dt or heart rate with any of the alpha adrenoceptor agonists. Selective antagonism of alpha-1 adrenoceptors with prazosin (1 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to phenylephrine but had a lesser effect on the response to B-HT 920. Antagonism of alpha-2 adrenoceptors with rauwolscine (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) caused a significantly greater attenuation of the pressor and vasoconstrictor responses to B-HT 920 than to phenylephrine. The responses to norepinephrine were significantly attenuated by antagonism of either alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Thus, in the conscious dog with reflex pathways blocked, selective stimulation of either postsynaptic alpha-1 or alpha-2 adrenoceptors increases arterial pressure and total peripheral resistance but does not significantly change heart rate, left ventricular dP/dt, stroke volume or cardiac output.", 
    "45": "Pretreatment of pig isolated bronchial preparations with isoproterenol (Iso) caused a time and concentration-related decrease in both the relaxant potency (pD2) and maximal relaxant effect (Emax) of Iso. Exposure to Iso (5 microM) caused an apparent reduction in the Iso pD2 at 6 hr of approximately 74-fold with a concomitant decrease in Iso Emax from 108 +/- 2 (n = 43) to 55 +/- 6% (n = 11). Responsiveness to the relaxant effects of Iso recovered spontaneously but slowly, being still incomplete 4 hr after desensitization with Iso (1 microM, 3 hr). Responsiveness to norepinephrine and fenoterol was also reduced markedly after exposure to Iso (5 microM), although the relaxant effects of the nonbeta agonists theophylline and forskolin were not reduced. Indeed, the potency of forskolin, was increased 4-fold. The beta antagonists propranolol (nonselective) and atenolol (beta-1 selective) protected bronchi from Iso-induced desensitization, whereas ICI-118551 (beta-2 selective) did not. Furthermore, the dextro (+)-isomer of Iso was virtually inactive as a desensitizing agent. Pretreatment with norepinephrine and fenoterol also decreased the relaxant effects of Iso, although they were at least 100 times less potent than Iso in desensitizing pig bronchi. These results indicate that desensitization was specifically mediated via beta-1 adrenoceptors which predominate in pig bronchus. Alpha adrenoceptor activity mediating increased bronchial tone was apparent in Iso-desensitized bronchi but not in nondesensitized preparations even in the presence of beta adrenoceptor blockade. Neither the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, nor the phospholipase A2 inhibitor mepacrine had any significant effect on the extent of Iso-induced desensitization in pig bronchus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The thermodynamic parameters associated with the interactions of agonists and antagonists with digitonin-solubilized beta adrenergic receptors were determined. A rapid method for measuring the binding of [125I]iodopindolol to soluble receptors using glass-fiber filters was developed. The binding of [125I]iodopindolol, an antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, to soluble receptors was temperature-sensitive as is the binding of the ligand to membrane-bound receptors. The interactions of propranolol and timolol with soluble receptors were independent of temperature. In contrast, the binding of agonists to soluble receptors was sensitive to temperature, although insensitive to GTP. Thermodynamically, the interactions of the antagonists timolol and propranolol with soluble beta adrenergic receptors were entropy-driven, with little contribution from changes in enthalpy. This is consistent with a hydrophobic interaction between the receptor and the antagonist. The binding of [125I]iodopindolol was enthalpy-driven. The binding of full agonists with soluble receptors was described thermodynamically by changes in enthalpy and entropy that were negative relative to the values for propranolol and timolol, suggesting that the guanine nucleotide-binding protein required for stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity and an intact lipid environment are not involved in the thermodynamics of formation of the low-affinity component of agonist binding. These results are consistent with an agonist-induced change in the conformation of the receptor.", 
    "47": "The properties associated with ligand interactions with membrane-bound beta adrenergic receptors prepared from L6 myoblasts were examined at five temperatures between 10 degrees and 30 degrees C. The interactions of antagonists with membrane-bound receptors were insensitive to temperature, whereas the interactions of agonists were temperature-dependent. The affinity constants for the low-affinity binding states of agonists (KL) decreased slightly with decreasing assay temperature. The small temperature-dependent changes in KL values were similar to the changes in Kd values observed in studies of the binding of agonists in the presence of GTP. The high-affinity dissociation constants (KH) for binding of full agonists to membrane-bound receptors in the absence of GTP were approximately 50-fold lower at 10 degrees than at 30 degrees C. The KH values for partial agonists also decreased with decreasing temperature, but the changes were smaller in magnitude. Thermodynamically, the binding of antagonists was primarily entropy-driven, whereas the binding of agonists was enthalpy-driven. The energetics of the low-affinity component of agonist binding to membrane-bound receptors were similar to the energetics for binding of agonists to membrane-bound receptors in the presence of GTP. Under these conditions, standard enthalpy change (delta H degree) and standard entropy change (delta S degree) values for binding of agonists were more negative than the corresponding values for binding of antagonists, possibly reflecting a conformational change in the receptor or an increased ordering of the lipids surrounding the receptor. The interaction of the receptor with the guanine nucleotide-binding protein to form the high-affinity component of agonist binding was thermodynamically described by larger negative changes in enthalpy and entropy than the values for formation of the low-affinity component of agonist binding. There was a correlation between the efficacies of ligands in activating adenylate cyclase and the delta H degree and delta S degree values for high-affinity binding of agonists. Thus, the extent or nature of the interaction between the guanine nucleotide-binding protein and the receptor may determine the efficacies of ligands.", 
    "48": "In conscious dogs, phentolamine infusion significantly increased fasting portal vein insulin, glucagon, and decreased net hepatic glucose output and plasma glucose. Propranolol significantly decreased portal vein insulin, portal flow, and increased hepatic glucose production and plasma glucose. Phentolamine, propranolol, and combined blockade reduced glucose absorption after oral glucose. alpha, beta, and combined blockade abolished the augmented fractional hepatic insulin extraction after oral glucose. Despite different absolute amounts of glucose absorbed and different amounts of insulin reaching the liver, the percent of the absorbed glucose retained by the liver was similar for control and with alpha- or beta blockade, but markedly decreased with combined blockade. Our conclusions are: (a) phentolamine and propranolol effects on basal hepatic glucose production may predominantly reflect their action on insulin and glucagon secretion; (b) after oral glucose, alpha- and beta-blockers separately or combined decrease glucose release into the portal system; (c) net hepatic glucose uptake is predominantly determined by hyperglycemia but can be modulated by insulin and glucagon; (d) direct correlation does not exist between hepatic delivery and uptake of insulin and net hepatic glucose uptake; (e) alterations in oral glucose tolerance due to adrenergic blockers, beyond their effects on glucose absorption, can be, to a large extent, mediated by their effects on insulin and glucagon secretion reflecting both hepatic and peripheral glucose metabolism.", 
    "49": "The antihypertensive effects of a 20 mg tablet of nifedipine were compared with those of hydralazine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Nineteen patients with a diastolic blood pressure (BP) between 95 and 120 mm Hg despite combined diuretic and beta-blocker therapy completed the protocol. After 2 weeks of placebo each subject received increasing doses of nifedipine (20, 40, and 60 mg b.i.d.) and hydralazine (25, 50, and 100 mg b.i.d.) if tolerated or until goal BP (supine and standing diastolic BP less than 85 mm Hg) was achieved. Both nifedipine and hydralazine significantly lowered supine BP from placebo baseline (146 +/- 3/96 +/- 2 mm Hg) to 119 +/- 3/80 +/- 2 and 129 +/- 2/81 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively. The decrease in systolic BP with nifedipine was significantly lower than that with hydralazine at 9 weeks. Neither drug significantly altered heart rate. Mean left ventricular ejection fractions were similar for nifedipine (67% +/- 2%), hydralazine (69% +/- 3%), and placebo (66% +/- 2%). The nifedipine tablet appears to be an effective antihypertensive agent in patients whose BP remains high despite combined diuretic and beta-blocker therapy.", 
    "50": "The goal of this study was to verify whether myocardial protection could be achieved via the intracoronary administration of propranolol in patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Accordingly, 21 patients undergoing PTCA were randomly assigned to receive either intracoronary placebo (group A, n = 10) or intracoronary propranolol (group B, n = 11). Three balloon inflations (i.e., coronary artery occlusions) were performed in each patient. Inflations I and II (maximum duration 60 sec) served as control occlusions. Inflation III (maximum duration 120 sec) was performed either after intracoronary administration of saline (2 ml) or propranolol (1.1 +/- 0.2 mg). The following electrocardiographic index of myocardial ischemic injury were measured: (1) time to development of ST segment elevation equal to 0.1 mV and (2) magnitude of ST segment elevation after 60 sec of coronary artery occlusion. Both indexes did not differ significantly between the groups during inflations I and II. In group A the time to development of ST segment elevation of 0.1 mV remained unchanged between the second and third occlusions (25 +/- 5 and 26 +/- 4 sec during inflations II and III, respectively). In group B subselective injection of propranolol into the affected coronary artery significantly prolonged the time to ST segment elevation of 0.1 mV from 19 +/- 4 sec (inflation II) to 53 +/- 9 sec (inflation III; p less than .001). Administration of placebo did not change the magnitude of ST segment elevation 60 sec after coronary artery occlusion between the second and third occlusion in group A (0.16 +/- 0.02 and 0.18 +/- 0.03 mV, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "Since 1978 there have been dramatic advances in the understanding of the pathophysiologic features of unstable angina pectoris and in the availability of new therapies of proven efficacy. Coronary artery spasm has been shown to be an important mechanism of acute myocardial ischemia in patients with unstable angina, and coronary thrombosis has been established as an early event in the development of acute myocardial infarction and, possibly, sudden death. Intravenous nitrates and oral calcium antagonists have been made available and are now widely used. Acetylsalicylic acid has been shown to be of benefit. Improved techniques of myocardial preservation and the introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have modified the surgical management of coronary artery disease.", 
    "52": "Three hundred and one patients were randomized to 3 years double-blind postinfarction treatment with metoprolol(N = 154) 100 mg b.i.d. or matching placebo (N = 147). Repeated 6 h electrocardiograms were performed pretreatment and after 3 days, 1 month, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months treatment. There were no significant differences in pretreatment ventricular arrhythmia in the two groups. In the placebo group there was an increase both in complexity of the arrhythmia (P less than 0.001) and frequency of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) (P less than 0.001) by time. These increases were blunted by metoprolol treatment. Treatment effect on mortality was similar in patients both with and without complex PVCs before treatment. In a retrospective analysis, the outcome of patients with an initial PVC frequency of greater than 1 PVC h-1 was evaluated. In metoprolol treated patients in whom the arrhythmia frequency was reduced by greater than 75% after three days of treatment, mortality was lower as compared to those metoprolol treated patients who did not show this treatment response (3% vs 28%, P = 0.013). Mortality in placebo treated patients with frequent PVCs was 24%. In conclusion, chronic metoprolol treatment after acute myocardial infarction blunts the naturally occurring increase of PVC frequency and PVC complexity by time. Patients with frequent PVCs in the early postinfarction phase who respond to metoprolol with greater than 75% reduction of the arrhythmias may have an excellent prognosis. However, this latter hypothesis has to be further tested in a prospective study.", 
    "53": "A true role of extrinsic nerve fibres proliferating abundantly in the aganglionic colon of Hirschsprung's disease has not yet been established. Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies were carried out on rectal muscle strips of piebald lethal mice and their siblings. Muscle strips of both aganglionic and normal colon obtained from fifteen patients with Hirschsprung's disease were also investigated for the purpose of determining whether these extrinsic nerve fibres innervate the smooth muscle cells in the aganglionic colon or not. Junction potentials and contractile tensions evoked by electric stimulations were recorded employing the double-sucrose gap method, and examined the effects of nerve blocking agents on junction potentials. In the normal colon, excitatory junction potentials and inhibitory junction potentials were recorded following stimulation in both man and mouse. Excitatory junction potentials were accompanied by muscle contraction and abolished by atropine or tetrodotoxin. Inhibitory junction potentials were resistant to phentolamine and propranolol, and abolished by tetrodotoxin. It was concluded that the normal colon of both mouse and man is innervated by cholinergic excitatory and non-adrenergic inhibitory nerves. In the aganglionic colon, on the other hand, neither junction potentials nor contractions were evoked by stimulations in both mouse and man. These evidences led to the conclusion that in the aganglionic colon in Hirschsprung's disease of man and murine model, there may be a deficiency in neuronal regulation.", 
    "54": "We examined the effect of endogenous neural and tubular dopamine production on renal function in isolated perfused kidneys. Nerves and proximal tubules in perfused kidneys produce dopamine from endogenous substrates. Surgical denervation 5-14 days before perfusion removed neural dopamine production and decreased dopamine excretion 32% (P less than 0.05), inulin clearance 7% (P less than 0.05), and sodium excretion 57% (P less than 0.01). Carbidopa, which abolished neural and tubular dopamine production, produced similar functional effects. Haloperidol, Sch 23390, and (+)butaclamol, but not (-)butaclamol, added during perfusion increased renovascular resistance 4-5% (P less than 0.001) and decreased inulin clearance 20% (P less than 0.001). Sch 23390 reduced fractional sodium excretion (P less than 0.01), but haloperidol and butaclamol did not. Chronic denervation or carbidopa blocked the reduction of inulin clearance by haloperidol, but alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonists did not. Fractional sodium excretion increased after adding haloperidol to denervated or adrenergic blocked kidneys. Denervation blocked the effect of Sch 23390 on inulin clearance but not on sodium excretion. Haloperidol inhibited dopamine excretion. Thus dopamine released from acutely severed nerves in perfused kidneys increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Dopamine produced by tubules of chronically denervated kidneys did not influence GFR but stimulated sodium excretion by an Sch 23390-sensitive mechanism.", 
    "55": "The role of Ni in mediation of alpha adrenergic stimulated respiration and breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 in brown adipocytes was examined using pertussis toxin. Phenylephrine stimulation of respiration and breakdown of PtdIns-4,5-P2 was still present in adipocytes harvested from hamsters treated with pertussis toxin although toxin modification of Ni appeared complete as judged from the absence of incorporation of [32P] from [32P]-NAD into a 41 KD protein in membranes. These data suggest that alpha-1 receptors on brown adipocytes are not coupled to inositide hydrolysis through Ni.", 
    "56": "The characteristics of beta-adrenergic receptors in human fetal lung were examined using the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist 3H-dihydroalprenolol /DHA/. Steady-state binding was reached by 15 min at 25 degrees C, and the association and dissociation rate constants were 0.0422 nM-1 min-1 and 0.0874 min-1, respectively. From saturation experiments, Bmax of 82.0 +/- 38 fmol/mg protein and KD = 1.85 +/- 0.92 nM were calculated. Inhibition of 3H-DHA binding by beta-1 /metoprolol/ and beta-2 /zinterol, IPS-339, fenoterol/ selective drugs resulted in biphasic displacement curves with slope factors less than 1.0. Analysis of these curves revealed a beta-1: beta-2 ratio of 40:60 in human fetal lung. The presence of 3H-DHA binding sites in early human lung may have a developmental importance which is not yet understood.", 
    "57": "Virtually all known biological actions stimulated by beta-adrenergic and other adenylate cyclase coupled receptors are mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Nonetheless, \"homologous\" or beta-adrenergic agonist-specific desensitization does not require cAMP. Since beta-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation may be involved in desensitization, we studied agonist-promoted receptor phosphorylation during homologous desensitization in wild-type S49 lymphoma cells (WT) and two mutants defective in the cAMP-dependent pathway of beta-agonist-stimulated protein phosphorylation (cyc- cannot generate cAMP in response to beta-adrenergic agonists; kin- lacks cAMP-dependent kinase). All three cell types demonstrate rapid, beta-adrenergic agonist-promoted, stoichiometric phosphorylation of the receptor which is clearly not cAMP mediated. The amino acid residue phosphorylated is solely serine. These data demonstrate, for the first time, that catecholamines can promote phosphorylation of a cellular protein (the beta-adrenergic receptor) via a cAMP-independent pathway. Moreover, the ability of cells with mutations in the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway to both homologously desensitize and phosphorylate the beta-adrenergic receptors provides very strong support for the notion that receptor phosphorylation may indeed be central to the molecular mechanism of desensitization.", 
    "58": "In a randomized trial the effect was studied of celiprolol, a cardioselective beta receptor blocker with strong intrinsic activity (ISA) on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). All patients received the first (oral) dose of 100 mg celiprolol or placebo exactly 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. Arrhythmia analysis was carried out from Holter recordings using a Pathfinder system. The results in 10 patients receiving celiprolol and 11 patients receiving placebo show that there was no difference in the distribution of the Lown classes between the two groups. The hourly VPC rate was somewhat higher in the celiprolol group from the very onset of the study, but the trend toward a decrease in VPC with time was identical in both groups. There was not a single incidence of ventricular fibrillation in the study population. It is concluded that celiprolol - under the circumstances of this study - did not show a beneficial influence on ventricular arrhythmias in AMI. This may, in part, be due to the strong ISA of this substance, but possibly also to the fact that celiprolol levels in the blood (measured by HPLC) were significantly lower in patients with AMI than in healthy volunteers.", 
    "59": "beta-Adrenoceptor density and responsiveness were examined in rat vas deferens following surgical and pharmacological treatments. Receptor density was measured by Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms of specific [125I]pindolol ([125I]PIN) binding in membrane homogenates. Functional responsiveness was measured by isoprenaline-induced inhibition of field stimulated (60 V, 1 ms, 0.1 Hz) or 40 mM K+-induced contractions. Four days following surgical denervation of vas deferens there was no change in the density of [125I]PIN binding sites, suggesting that these sites are not located on prejunctional neurons. Neither 7 day bilateral adrenalectomy, 21 day denervation, nor 7 days treatment with 10 mg/kg per day desmethylimipramine caused changes in either the potency of isoprenaline in inhibiting contraction or the density of [125I]PIN binding sites compared to controls. Infusion of 3 mg/kg per day isoprenaline for 8 days significantly reduced the potency of isoprenaline in inhibiting field stimulated contractions, reduced the maximum degree of inhibition, and reduced the density of [125I]PIN binding sites. These results suggest that beta-adrenoceptor density and responsiveness in rat vas deferens are not affected by removal of adrenal hormones or neuronal stimulation, but that receptor density and responsiveness can be decreased by increasing the concentration of beta-adrenoceptor agonists at the receptor. Therefore, beta-adrenoceptors in rat vas deferens probably receive little tonic stimulation under normal circumstances.", 
    "60": "Chronic beta-receptor blockade on exercise-induced leukocytosis was studied in 11 hypertensive males. Blood samples for determinating leukocytes were taken before and during the 6th min and the 30th min of submaximal exercise, at maximal exercise, and 5 and 15 min after work. Lymphocytosis and granulocytosis were found to be dependent on the intensity and duration of the exercise. Leukocytosis during short-term and long-term exercise was due to both a lymphocytosis and granulocytosis. Under resting conditions, the chronic beta-receptor blockade caused a significant decrease of neutrophil granulocytes. Both the patients and the controls showed the same percent increase in leukocytes compared with the untreated control study. This suggests that the adrenergic system does not play the primary role in exercise-induced leukocytosis.", 
    "61": "After a clinical trial was completed in which two commonly used antihypertensive agents (prazosin and propranolol) were compared, 20 previously untreated men with moderate, asymptomatic, essential hypertension returned to the care of their general practitioners. Twelve months later 17 patients who were still attending the same doctor demonstrated improved blood pressure control with a decrease in their lying diastolic blood pressure from 96 +/- 2 mmHg to 91 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01). Only two of the 17 patients had not by then achieved satisfactory control. Eleven patients (65%) were still taking at least one of the trial medications; clinicians seemed to prefer prazosin (10 patients). Only one of seven patients was still taking propranolol although five patients had begun treatment with other beta-blocking agents. One patient had ceased drug treatment. This survey indicates that many general practitioners are able to maintain or even improve blood pressure control in patients whose blood pressure has been stabilized initially. However, the reasons for the medication preference were unclear and studies of the clinical behaviour that influences a general practitioner's choice of medication are required.", 
    "62": "The peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes is a destructive phenomenon that can be elicited in various ways. Surface receptor molecules that allow cells to respond to hormones are possibly inactivated during lipid peroxidation. Effects of lipid peroxidation on receptors have not been extensively examined thus far. This investigation shows that there is a decrease in beta-adrenoceptor density (measured as specific (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding) during lipid peroxidation, in both lungs and erythrocytes of the rat. To this end, lung membranes (containing both beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptors) and intact erythrocytes (containing a homogeneous beta 2-adrenoceptor population) were pretreated with cumene hydroperoxide (lung membranes with 0.1 mM and erythrocytes with 1 mM) and Fe2+ (1 X 10(-5) M) for 60 min which resulted in extensive lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde formation. The ration beta 1-:beta 2-adrenoceptor density in lung membranes after treatment with cumene hydroperoxide did not change and remained at 30%:70%. A single injection (i.p.) with the herbicide paraquat (50 mg/kg, 24 h), which is known to cause lung damage via lipid peroxidation, resulted in similar alterations in receptor density to those caused by cumene hydroperoxide in the in vitro experiments.", 
    "63": "Although twice-daily instillation of topical beta-blockers is the standard regimen for treatment of increased intraocular pressure, once-daily therapy might improve patient compliance and provide greater safety. In a three-month, double-masked clinical trial, 92 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension received levobunolol 0.5% or 1% or timolol 0.5% once daily, in both eyes. Overall mean decreases in intraocular pressure were significantly greater in the groups treated with levobunolol than in the group treated with timolol. Intraocular pressure decreases averaged 7.0 mm Hg with levobunolol 0.5%, 6.5 mm Hg with levobunolol 1%, and 4.5 mm Hg with timolol. The intraocular pressures of 72% (18 of 25 patients) of those treated with levobunolol 0.5%, 79% (22 of 28 patients) of those treated with levobunolol 1%, and 64% (16 of 25 patients) of those treated with timolol were successfully controlled during the study. Heart rate and blood pressure decreases were minimal with both levobunolol and timolol. Study results indicated that once-daily treatment with levobunolol and, to a lesser extent, timolol is sufficient to control intraocular pressure successfully and safely.", 
    "64": "In a randomized double-blind study (N = 562), a traditional treatment schedule, starting antihypertensive treatment in elderly hypertensive patients (60 to 75 years old) with 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide once daily and doubling the dose if a satisfactory response was not achieved, was compared with antihypertensive treatment of 100 mg of metoprolol once daily, adding 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide for patients whose response was not satisfactorialy achieved with metoprolol alone. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was significantly reduced with both regimens. The frequency rates of responders (diastolic blood pressure, less than or equal to 95 mm Hg) in the metoprolol group and the hydrochlorothiazide group were 50% and 47% after four weeks and 65% and 61% after eight weeks, respectively. There were no significant differences in total symptom score or single symptoms between the regimens, but significantly more patients had hypokalemia and hyperuricemia with the hydrochlorothiazide regimen. Thus, we conclude that beginning antihypertensive treatment with 100 mg of metoprolol once daily and adding a small dose of hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg) in patients whose response is not satisfactory with metoprolol alone appears to be effective and safe in elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "65": "The capacity to modify the incorporation of [2-3H]myo-inositol into inositides and inositol phosphates was different for three psychotropic cationic amphiphilic drugs. Chlorpromazine, desmethylimipramine and propranolol were able to increase the labeling of inositol-containing lipids, but only chlorpromazine dramatically increased the incorporation into inositol phosphate, -bisphosphate and -trisphosphate. The increase was 10- to 50-fold in 60 min as compared with controls. This effect is not due to stimulation of lipid labeling, because in chase experiments radioactivity in inositol phosphates increased to a greater extent than in their parent lipids. It is possible that the alteration of phosphoinositide catabolism is related to the neuroleptic activity of the drug.", 
    "66": "These experiments examined the effects, on retention, of posttraining intra-amygdala administration of norepinephrine (NE), and propranolol. Rats were trained on a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task and tested for retention 24 h later. Injections were administered bilaterally (1.0 microliter/injection) through chronically-implanted cannulae. Low doses of NE (0.1 or 0.3 microgram) administered shortly after training enhanced retention while higher doses (1.0 or 5.0 micrograms) were ineffective. Retention was not affected by NE administered 3 h after training. The effect of intra-amygdala NE on retention is blocked by simultaneous administration of propranolol (0.2 microgram). This finding suggests that the memory-enhancing effect of NE may be mediated by beta-receptors. Posttraining intra-amygdala NE also attenuated the retention deficit produced by adrenal demedullation. Further, intra-amygdala injections of propranolol (0.2 microgram) blocked the enhancing effect, on retention, of posttraining s.c. injections of epinephrine. These findings suggest that activation of noradrenergic receptors in the amygdala may be involved in memory processing and may play a role in the memory-modulating effect of peripheral epinephrine.", 
    "67": "The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the in vivo beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties of urapidil, a new antihypertensive alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocking agent. In dogs anesthetized with pentobarbital, the cardioaccelerator nerve was isolated, decentralized and stimulated electrically to elicit adrenergically mediated increases in heart rate. Dobutamine was administered (3-30 micrograms/kg i.v.) to elicit increases in heart rate by the direct stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. Urapidil 2 mg/kg i.v. had no significant effect on cardioaccelerator nerve-induced tachycardia, but 5 mg/kg i.v. decreased the response by 27%. Heart rate responses to dobutamine were suppressed slightly by the low dose of urapidil and to a greater degree by the high dose of urapidil, whereas the pressor response to dobutamine was markedly attenuated at both dose levels. Neurally or dobutamine-elicited tachycardia remaining after urapidil treatment was eliminated by propranolol (1 mg/kg i.v.). When the selective alpha 2-antagonist rauwolscine was administered (1000 micrograms/kg i.v.), tachycardic responses to nerve stimulation increased 49% above control, and urapidil (5 mg/kg) given subsequently, caused a 48% reduction in the response. These data indicate that urapidil has weak beta 1-blocking activity more clearly seen after blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", 
    "68": "Specific beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonists, acebutolol and butoxamine respectively were used to investigate the involvement of blockade of these receptors in the inhibition of harmaline-induced tremors. Both agents produced an antitremor effect in a dose-dependent manner, with butoxamine showing greater potency than acebutolol. The dose of isoprenaline (0.1 mg/kg) that markedly reduced the effect of butoxamine did not alter the effect of acebutolol, suggesting that antagonism of peripheral beta 1-adrenoceptor was not responsible for the antitremor action of acebutolol and that blockade of peripheral beta 2-receptors is involved to a great extent in the inhibition of tremors by butoxamine. The effect of acebutolol was unaltered in rats pretreated with 5-hydroxytryptophan and p-chlorophenylalanine, which on the other hand produced potentiation and a partial reduction respectively of the action of butoxamine. It appears, therefore, that butoxamine also acts centrally in association with the 5-HT system and that this action is relatively weaker than the peripheral action. The dual action on two sites may account for the potent antitremor action of butoxamine.", 
    "69": "The influence of the ATP analog alpha, beta-methylene ATP on the action of adrenaline on alpha 1-receptors of smooth muscle cells of guinea-pig taenia caeci was studied by measuring potential changes. The preparation was superfused (1 ml/min) with Krebs solution or calcium-free solution containing atropine (10(-6) M) and propranolol (10(-6) M) at 22 degrees C, using the sucrose-gap method. The ATP analog (10(-5) to 4 X 10(-4) M) and adrenaline (10(-5) M) both caused a transient hyperpolarization in the absence of external calcium (20 min). The response (area under the 'curve') evoked under calcium-free conditions (20 min) increased with the concentration of the ATP analog. The response was diminished when preceded by the adrenaline response (10(-5) M) or when evoked after repeated addition of the analog to the superfusate (35 min). The adrenaline response was also diminished when preceded by the ATP analog. The responses to the ATP analog or adrenaline in the presence of apamin (3 X 10(-7) M) in the absence of external calcium were characterized by depolarization of the muscle cells. Repeated addition of the ATP analog or adrenaline to the preparation under these conditions did not cause any effect. The results suggest strongly that adrenaline and alpha, beta-methylene ATP both activate the same calcium-dependent process, producing calcium mobilization and the opening of apamin-sensitive potassium channels. Besides this action the ATP analog also activates apamin-sensitive potassium channels and this activation is independent of the availability of calcium in the adrenaline-sensitive pool.", 
    "70": "The mechanisms by which intracerebroventricular (i.v.t.) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) produce hyperthermia in the rat were investigated. I.v.t. PGE2 produced dose-related increases in blood pressure, heart rate and rectal temperature which were significant with a dose of 0.5 ng. Oxygen consumption also increased and remained above baseline over an hour with 50 and 500 ng PGE2 doses. Ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) attenuated the blood pressure and heart rate response to PGE2 but metabolic rate and rectal temperature increases were unchanged. Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.) decreased the heart rate response to PGE2 but had no significant effect on blood pressure, metabolic rate and rectal temperature responses. These results suggest a similar sensitivity of central receptors for mediating cardiovascular and metabolic rate/temperature increases but suggest that the mechanisms mediating these effects are separate.", 
    "71": "The excitatory responses of neurones in the anterior cingulate cortex of the rat to iontophoretically applied substance P (SP) are reduced by noradrenaline (NA) applied iontophoretically or released from noradrenergic pathways. In order to determine the receptor involved in this inhibitory effect we have studied the effects of a number of receptor-specific adrenergic agonists and antagonists on responses of cingulate neurones to SP in rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate. Low iontophoretic currents (0-15 nA) of NA, adrenaline and the beta-agonist, clenbuterol, all strongly reduced responses to SP. Isoprenaline was also effective but less consistently so, although problems were experienced with its iontophoretic release from micropipettes. The alpha 1-agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine were also able to reduce responses to SP. However, this reduction required higher iontophoretic currents (15-60 nA) and was associated with depressant effects on baseline firing rate. The alpha 2-agonist clonidine was only weakly active at high currents and this too was associated with depression of baseline firing. Similar weak effects were noted with dopamine. The inhibitory effects of NA on SP responses were convincingly blocked or reversed by the beta-antagonist, practolol, but not by the alpha 1-antagonist, prazosin. The reduction of SP responses by phenylephrine was also blocked by practolol but unaffected by prazosin. Finally, reduction of SP excitations by activation of the coeruleocortical pathway was also blocked by practolol applied iontophoretically to the cortical cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effect of NA on SP responsiveness in the cingulate cortex is mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors.", 
    "72": "The effects of nicotine microinjected into several brain regions on the centrally elevated gastric acid output and mucosal blood flow (MBF) were examined in anesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) induced increases in gastric acid output and MBF. These increases were inhibited dose dependently by nicotine microinjected into the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (NDV) but not into various hypothalamic regions. This effect of nicotine was abolished with concomitantly administered hexamethonium and was not observed in reserpine-pretreated animals. Electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) induced an increase in gastric acid output. This increase was completely inhibited when nicotine was microinjected into the NDV 5 min before stimulation. This inhibitory effect of nicotine was abolished by concomitantly administered hexamethonium and by intraventricular pretreatment with phentolamine, but not with propranolol. These results suggest that activation of nicotinic receptors within the NDV releases noradrenaline and that there is a resultant inhibition of gastric acid output and MBF.", 
    "73": "The autonomic receptors in the rat kidney were characterized using the radioligands [3H]prazosin, [3H]clonidine, [3H]dihydroalprenolol (DHA) and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). The specific binding of [3H]prazosin, [3H]clonidine, [3H]DHA and [3H]QNB to rat kidney membranes was saturable and of high affinity, and showed a pharmacological specificity as well as stereospecificity which characterized renal alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinoceptors, respectively. There was a relatively greater density of alpha-adrenoceptors than beta-adrenoceptors or muscarinic cholinoceptors in the rat kidney. Chemical sympathectomy of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine X HBr (6-OHDA, 50 X 2 mg/kg i.v., 24 h interval) caused a significant increase (21-56%) in the Bmax values for renal [3H]prazosin, [3H]clonidine and [3H]DHA binding at 1 and 2 weeks following the treatment, without a change in the Kd values. 6-OHDA treatment had no significant effect on the Kd and Bmax values for [3H]QNB binding at 1-3 weeks after the treatment. The norepinephrine (NE) concentration was reduced (68-76%) in the 6-OHDA-treated rat kidney. In conclusion, the present study provides biochemical evidence for the possible localization of postsynaptic alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors and muscarinic cholinoceptors in the rat kidney and also for the regulation of these adrenoceptors by the sympathetic nervous system.", 
    "74": "Accidental observation of early cure of lichen planus in a female patient who received propranalol for the treatment of associated hyperthyroidism made us to try this drug in 20 patients with lichen planus. The cutaneous lesions responded very well to the treatment in 909'o of the cases. The mucous membrane lesions responded only partially and slowly. Another group of 20 patients with lichen planus who received only oral pheniramine maleate showed persistence of skin lesions even after 3 months. There were no serious side effects -with propranalol, though one patient with an atopic background, developed bronchial asthma for the first time at the age of 21. The excellent therapeutic response to propranalol-a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, in these patients indicates further study.", 
    "75": "15 hypertensive patients presenting with diastolic blood pressures (DBP) of 130 mmHg or higher were hospitalised and treated with oral labetolol. They all received a diuretic and 400 mg of labetolol orally initially and subsequent doses at 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours depending on the level of diastolic pressure. The mean of systolic/diastolic blood pressure dropped from 241/130 mmHg to 191/125 mmHg 30 minutes after the initial dose, and to 157/103 mmHg after six hours. Of the patients 73% had DBP of 115 mmHg or less six hours after the initial dose. Oral labetolol is recommended in hypertensive emergencies when sodium nitroprusside, diazoxide or trimethaphan cannot be used as an alternative to other agents.", 
    "76": "Sixteen cats were studied to test the hypothesis that oxygen chemoreception in the cat aortic body is dependent on the beta-adrenergic mechanism. The chemoreceptor activity was measured from a few aortic chemoreceptor afferents in each cat, anesthetized with alpha-chloralose (60 mg X kg-1). Three types of experiments were conducted. Aortic chemoreceptor responses to steady-state hypoxia (PaO2 range, 100-30 Torr) were measured (a) before and during intravenous infusion of the beta-receptor agonist, isoproterenol (0.5 micrograms X kg-1) in nine spontaneously breathing cats, and (b) before and after intravenous injection of the beta-receptor antagonist, propranolol (1 mg X kg-1) in seven cats which were paralyzed and artificially ventilated. In the third category (c) the stimulatory effect of hypotension on aortic chemoreceptor activity was measured in six of the seven cats in group (b) before and after propranolol injection. Isoproterenol infusion only moderately stimulated aortic chemoreceptor activity. This stimulation was blocked by propranolol. However, propranolol did not attenuate aortic chemoreceptor responses to hypoxia or to hypotension. We conclude that the beta-receptor adrenergic mechanism does not mediate oxygen chemoreception in the cat aortic body.", 
    "77": "The cardiovascular effects of some beta-adrenoreceptor agonists on heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractility (maximum rate of change of left ventricular pressure/integrated isometric tension) were measured in pentobarbitone-anaesthetised and conscious, instrumented greyhounds. In anaesthetised dogs isoprenaline increased heart rate and myocardial contractility and reduced blood pressure. Prenalterol and RO 363, in equiactive inotropic doses, induced greater increases in heart rate than isoprenaline if blood pressure fell by less than 25 mmHg. Salbutamol had hypotensive activity at all doses and appeared to be a relatively selective inotrope. None of the agonists caused blood pressure to fall in the conscious dogs. Prenalterol and RO 363 were more effective inotropic stimulants, producing smaller increases in heart rate and more pronounced increases in myocardial contractility. Salbutamol, however, elicited greater increases in heart rate in the conscious animals and the inotropic selectivity demonstrated in the anaesthetised animals was lost. The direct effects of the beta-adrenoreceptor agonists, without modification by reflexes could be observed in the anaesthetised animals. The differences in the actions of the agonists in the conscious animals appear to be attributable to the state of the baroreceptor reflex control system and the relatively enhanced responsiveness of the heart.", 
    "78": "The cardiovascular effects of centrally administered 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) have been analysed in conscious normotensive and hypertensive rats. In conscious normotensive rats, 5-HT, (1-30 micrograms) administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) produced profound and immediate dose-related decreases in heart rate and small increases in blood pressure. The initial pressor responses were followed by secondary secondary depressor responses at high doses of 5-HT. Similar effects were produced by 5-HT i.c.v. in conscious DOCA-salt and spontaneously hypertensive rats, although the magnitude of the pressor responses was substantially greater in hypertensive than normotensive rats. Pretreatment with either N-methylatropine or atenolol intra-arterially reduced the 5-HT-induced bradycardia in normotensive rats; the reduction was enhanced when both antagonists were given in combination. The 5-HT2 antagonist, cyproheptadine (10 micrograms i.c.v.) increased basal blood pressure and heart rate in normotensive rats. Subsequent administration of 5-HT i.c.v. produced biphasic effects on heart rate consisting of an initial tachycardia followed by a marked bradycardia. Methysergide (10 micrograms i.c.v.) pretreatment did not alter resting heart rate, but attenuated the 5-HT induced bradycardia. A higher dose of methysergide, (30 micrograms i.c.v.), decreased resting blood pressure and heart rate. This study has demonstrated, therefore, that the 5-HT induced bradycardia is produced by not only a centrally mediated decrease in sympathetic tone, but also an increase in vagal drive to the heart. The bradycardia is antagonised by centrally administered methysergide, but not by cyproheptadine, which suggests that it is probably mediated through a '5-HT1-like' receptor mechanism."
