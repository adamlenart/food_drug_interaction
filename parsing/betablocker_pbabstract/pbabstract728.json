In the present study we examined the effects of UM-272 on the function of isolated rabbit cardiac mitochondria and microsomes. Concentrations of 13 micrometers or below were without effect on these organelles. UM-272 (130 micrometers) significantly decreased respiratory control of mitochondria utilizing glutamate plus malate, or succinate, as substrates. At 1.3 mM, UM-272 increased the initial rate of basal oxygen consumption, and decreased the rate of ADP-stimulated respiration. UM-272 was slightly more potent than d,1-propranolol. At a concentration of 1.3 mM, UM-272 significantly decreased the rate and maximum amount of 45CaCl2 accumulated by microsomes in the presence of ATP and oxalate. Concentrations of drug that suppress cellular metabolism are close to those required to prevent ischemic injury. We suggest that sarcolemmal and intracellular actions of the drug which help to depress oxygen demand and ATP utilization may account for part of the drug's protective effects.", 
    "1": "Visken (pindolol), a blocking agent of adrenergic beta-receptors, was used in the treatment of hypertensive crisis in 30 patients (stage I of the disease in 4, stage II in 23, stage III in 3). Intravenous injfection of visken in a dose of 1 mg led to a decrease of arterial pressure in all patients and relieved the clinical manifestations of crisis completely or partly. Significant reduction of arterial pressure and deceleration of pulse were already in evidence in 5 minutes after injection of the drug. In most patients maximum drop in pressure occurred in 30--60 minutes. There were no complications. As compared to obsidan (propranolol), which was used by other authors in hyperkinetic-type crisis, visken had the same effect on pressure and pulse. The peripheral vasodilator hyperstat (diazoxide) was used in the treatment of crisis in 28 patients with hypertensive disease (stage II of the disease in 21, and stage III in 7). In intravenous injection of 300 mg of hyperstat the hypotensive effect occurred in 1--5 minutes and reached maximum in 5 minutes. A hypotensive and clinical effect was noted in all patients. No complications were observed. On comparison with the results obtained by other authors in hyperstat treatment of hypo- and eukinetic types of crisis no essential difference in the hypotensive effect were noted.", 
    "2": "Clinical-functional analysis of the efficacy of propranolol was conducted in 32 patients with ischemic heart disease and stable angina pectoris (with angiographically verified stenosing coronary atherosclerosis) depending on the initial myocardial contractility. A marked antianginal effect of propranolol in a dose of up to 160 mg daily was demonstrated irrespective of the initial myocardial contractile function. Treatment with propranolol was not attended with signs of cardiac insufficiency or aggravation of its subclinical symptoms. The results of the study provide convincing data that optimum doses of blocking agents of beta-adrenergic receptors of the myocardium causing a negative inotropic effect even in patients with diminished myocardial function may be used more widely.", 
    "3": "Thirty patients with mild to severe essential hypertension satisfactorily controlled by twice-daily sotalol therapy entered a double-blind, crossover study comparing the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of their usual twice-daily sotalol administration with the same dosage given once daily. Each double-blind period extended eight weeks, during which blood pressure and pulse rate were recorded by a nurse three times daily on alternate days during the last week of each period in the patients' usual living conditions. Plasma sotalol concentration was measured before the morning dosage of sotalol. No statistically significant differences in the parameters were found between once- and twice-daily sotalol administration using sotalol in daily dosages from 80 to 320 mg. All patients concluded the trial, and no increase in side effects was noted during the once-daily period.", 
    "4": "The beta-adrenergic blocker sotalol, administered only once a day, proved an extremely effective and safe agent for the 24-hour control of essential hypertension, even in patients with a severe form of the disease. Significant (P less than 0.01) decreases from the baseline levels were noted in both supine and standing blood pressures as early as the first week after sotalol administration in the 15 patients who participated in the open study. All patients were titrated and controlled by six to eight weeks or sooner. By the conclusion of the 12-week study, mean supine systolic blood pressure in the 15 patients fell 21 per cent (from 176 mm Hg to 139 mm Hg), and mean supine diastolic blood pressure was down 23 per cent (from 115 mm Hg to 89 mm Hg). Standing values were similarly decreased by sotalol administration at a mean daily dose of 341 mg. Two of the patients also received concomitant 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide per day, and four received 40 mg furosemide per day. A comparison with the pretherapy placebo values indicates that all the declines were highly significant (P less than 0.001). Sotalol was very well tolerated, an no adverse reactions were reported during the entire study. There were also no significant changes in laboratory findings except for a drop in serum cholesterol.", 
    "5": "After intravenous injection, sotalol follows a two-compartment distribution pattern. The processes of distribution and elimination are of first order; the intravenous biological half-life is 6 to 8 hours. The drug is mainly excreted by glomerular filtration via the kidney, and metabolites are not found. Of the pharmacodynamic parameters measured, the isoproterenol-induced changes in heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, and free fatty acid return to baseline values immediately during the injection of the beta blocker. Peripheral arterial circulation, lactate, glucose, and pyruvate respond to the beta blocker after a delay. Besides the compartmental distribution of sotalol, other mechanisms of sotalol such as varying responses of the receptors to sotalol or more sluggish intrinsic kinetics of the decrease of parameters measured have to be considered. The effects of various beta blockers may be qualitatively and quantitatively differentiated on the basis of experiments with our test model using steady-state isoproterenol infusion in humans.", 
    "6": "Sotalol significantly reduces resting and exercise-stimulated heart rate and plasma renin activity 2 hours and to a lesser degree also 24 hours after oral administration of a single 200-mg dose in healthy volunteers. Because of this 24-hour beta-adrenoceptor blocking effect, sotalol should be suitable for once-daily dosing in clinical practice.", 
    "7": "The occurrence of hypertensive crises, arrhythmias and hypotensive crises during surgery for pheochromocytoma can be prevented both preoperatively and intraoperatively by adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade and volume replacement. Only in a few cases is additional beta-adrenergic blockade necessary. Preoperatively the author uses phenoxybenzamine (Dibenicyline) as alpha-blockade in a dose of 20-30 mg daily, and propanolol (Inderal) as beta-blockade in a dose of 4 X 20 mg daily, both given orally. Intraoperatively he gives preference to alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers with a short halflife, i.e. phentolamine (Regitin) and lidocaine or pranolol as the beta-adrenergic blocker.", 
    "8": "Studies of metoprolol in asthmatic patients showed beta 1-selective blocking properties on the adrenergic receptor. Metoprolol in a dose of 40 mg given orally to 9 asthmatic patients significantly decreased the pulse rate at 60 and 120 minutes and the systolic blood pressure at 120 minutes but did not cause any increase of respiratory impedance, measured by the forced oscillation technique. A double-blind test was carried out to compare the effects of metoprolol and inactive placebo on the respiratory response to isoproterenol in 24 asthmatic patients. In the metoprolol group, systolic blood pressure decreased significantly and pulse rate at rest also tended to decrease. There was no significant difference between the metoprolol and placebo groups in the respiratory response to an isoproterenol aerosol.", 
    "9": "beta-Adrenoceptor blocking agents are important agents in the management of many cardiovascular problems. Multiple neuropsychiatric adverse reactions have been noted with their use. This article reviews these reactions and describes the case of a suspected propranolol-induced psychosis.", 
    "10": "Dopamine caused a dose-related relaxation in helically cut strips of dog coronary and renal arteries treated with phenoxybenzamine andcontracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. The dose-response curve to dopamine was shifted to the right by droperidol in concentrations above 3 X 10(-5) M. Adenosine-induced relaxations were not attenuated by droperidol. The dose--relaxation curve to isoproterenol was also shifted to the right by droperidol. Propranolol (10(-6) M) failed to significantly alter the dose response curve to dopamine, and in propranolol-treated preparations the antagonism by droperidol of dopamine actions was practically identical with that in control preparations. Droperidol appears to act as a reversible, surmountable antagonist to dopamine actions on dog arterial smooth muscles, and such evidence supports the hypothesis of specific dopamine receptors in dog arteries.", 
    "11": "1 The plasma levels of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol have been measured in 17 hypertensive patients receiving chronic oral therapy with propranolol. 2 The range of plasma propranolol concentrations was from 5.3 to 300 ng/ml, and that of 4-hydroxypropranolol was from 2.1 to 36.0 ng/ml. 3 The mean (+/- s.d.) plasma concentration ratio of 4-hydroxypropranolol to propranolol was 0.130 (+/- 0.005); however, a very wide range was observed with individual values ranging from 0.057 to 0.241. 4 A statistically significant correlation was observed between the plasma concentration of 4-hydroxypropranolol and that of propranolol. 5 Propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol plasma concentrations were each significantly, but poorly, correlated with daily propranolol dose. 6 The clinical significance of the results has been discussed.", 
    "12": "This study investigated the influence of the administration of pharmacological agents on the recovery of rabbit kidneys from the effects of 1 hr of situ normothermic ischemia, utilizing acute and chronic models. The agents tested included the diuretics mannitol and furosemide, the vasoactive agents phenoxybenzamine, propranolol, and dopamine, and the membrane stabilizers chlorpromazine and methylprednisolone. A beneficial effect was detected only with the diuretic agents and propranolol when given prior to the ischemic insult.", 
    "13": "The action of adrenergic agonists on ion fluxes across the epithelium of the canine trachea was determined. Isolated sheets of tracheal mucosal membranes were mounted in Ussing-type chambers, bathed with Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4, and gassed with 5% CO2 Iin oxygen. Various adrenergic agents, when added to the bathing medium elevated short-circuit current (SCC) (isoproterenol greater than epinephrine greater than norepinephrine greater than phenylephrine). Propranolol (10(-6) M) decreased SCC response to epinephrine. Epinephrine (1mM) increased both unidirectional 36Cl fluxes; net 36Cl secretion toward the lumen increased from 2.01 +/- 0.52 to 3.20 +/- 0.46 mueg/cm2.h (P less than 0.05); 22Na flux did not change. In epinephrine-stimulated tissues, propranolol (1mM) abolished net 36Cl secretion. The SCC response to epinephrine was blunted in the absence of Na from the submucosal reservoir; this blunting suggests that Cl entry across the basal membrane is coupled with Na. Both the relative sensitivities of SCC to various adrenergic agonists and the effect of propranolol suggest that Cl-secretory process is highly sensitive to beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Epinephrine increased cell membrane permeability to Cl and probably stimulated a specific Cl pump.", 
    "14": "In this case, the first reported instance of aortic dissection involving a right-sided arch, an anomalous fourth arch vessel, the left subclavian artery, arose from a congenital aortic diverticulum. This report emphasizes the need for precise anatomic definition with aortography to permit appropriate therapy when congenital anomalies of the aortic arch are complicated by dissecting hematoma.", 
    "15": "The selection of appropriate antiarrhythmic drug therapy depends on a knowledge of the drugs available, their spectrum of action, their pharmacokinetics, and their major side effects. It is important to know how the pharmacokinetics of a drug vary with different disease states so that appropriate adjustments to dosage can be made. Drugs with similar actions can be assigned into groups, and five different groups can be identified. The commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs are reviewed, and some of the newer drugs are discussed.", 
    "16": "The relative importance of presystemic and systemic glucuronidation of propranolol was examined in normal subjects given single oral and intravenous doses of propranolol. The areas under the plasma concentration--time curves (AUCs) of propranolol glucuronide (PG), 41 +/- 15 ng . hr/ml, and propranolol, 48 +/- 15 ng . hr/ml, were of the same order after the intravenous dose (0.05 mg/kg). After oral doses of 20 and 80 mg, the AUCs of PG were 302 +/- 105 and 1,398 +/- 409 ng . hr/ml; these were 7 times the AUCs of propranolol, 44 +/- 15 and 220 +/- 38 ng . hr/ml. The time lapse to peak concentration, 1.5 to 3.0 hr, and the plasma half-life, 3.2 to 3.7 hr, were the same for PG and propranolol. These results demonstrate glucuronidation as an important determinant of propranolol bioavailability.", 
    "17": "The role of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme activity for plasma propranolol and sotalol levels was investigated in 68 patients with hypertension or angina pectoris by comparing elimination rate with antipyrine kinetics and cytochrome P-450 content in the liver. All subjects were resistant to or had hepatotoxic reaction to previous treatment. Plasma antipyrine clearance and cytochrome P-450 content in biopsies were related to propranolol elimination from plasma, the best fit being obtained with the clearance values. Sotalol plasma clearance was not related to any indirect or direct reflector of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme system. The results demonstrate that plasma clearance of the short-acting beta blocker, propranolol, depends on the activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme system and indicates a trial with a drug such as sotalol which is not dependent on liver metabolizing capacity.", 
    "18": "Fourteen patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome were studied by means of intracardiac stimulation techniques, before and after the intravenous administration of propranolol, 0.1 mg./Kg. There were no significant change, or only a slight increase, in the effective refractory periods of all parts of the re-entry tachycardia circuit studied, in either anterograde or retrograde directions. Re-entry tachycardia was initiated in nine patients in the control state, and in 10 patients after propranolol. The rate of re-entry atrioventricular node-accessory pathway tachycardia was decreased, but by only 10 per cent. The duration and outer limit of the tachycardia zone of atrial extrastimuli were not significantly decreased. Propranolol, by rapid intravenous infusion administration, is unlikely to be effective primary therapy for PSVT in the WPW syndrome.", 
    "19": "Timoptol Ophthalmic Solution (timolol maleate, MSD) is a topical beta-adrenergic receptor blokking agent which lowers elevated intraocular pressure when applied once or twice daily. It represents a major advance in topical therapy for glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure. It is more effective in reducing elevated intraocular pressure and produces fewer side effects than pilocarpine and epinephrine. It does not alter pupil size or affect visual acuity. Timoptol maintained satisfactory reductions in intraocular pressure in long-term maintenance studies treating over 100 patients for up to 16 months. The drug was well tolerated and without serious adverse effects. In general, reductions in intraocular pressure for non-white patients (predominantly Blacks) were similar to the Whites.", 
    "20": "1. The effects of atenolol on diurnal blood pressure control, heart rate and plasma catecholamines were studied in nine hypertensives, six of whom also received diuretics. The patients completed a double-blind trial in which the effects of once and twice daily administration of atenolol were compared with placebo. 2. Atenolol (100 mg) given once a day produced significant reduction in diurnal blood pressures recorded at home but the effect was slightly less than either 50 mg given twice a day or 200 mg once a day. 3. Effects on heart rate and blood pressure were seen within 36 hours of the first dose, and were near maximal at 72 hours. After cessation of the drug, mean resting heart rate increased gradually and reached pre-treatment levels five days later, suggesting strong tissue binding of atenolol. Blood pressure increased more slowly over 8--10 days. 4. Plasma noradrenaline levels were increased at rest with atenolol. This argues strongly against the antihypertensive effect of atenolol being due to a reduction of sympathetic nerve activity. 5. Once daily administration of atenolol in this group of patients with mild hypertension produced satisfactory diurnal blood pressure control and beta blockade without \"rebound\" hypertension on cessation of therapy.", 
    "21": "Eighteen patients with mild to moderately severe hypertension were treated, after a run-in period of placebo for three weeks, with a combination of 160 mg sotalol and 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide for three months. Fifteen patients responded well and, after one month of treatment, had a sustained diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg. Additional treatment reduced the blood pressure even further during the second month, with a significant fall in blood pressure after the first month of treatment. The degree of severity of the hypertension did not seem to have an effect on blood pressure response to treatment. Serum potassium values decreased significantly during treatment. They remained within the normal range, and no clinical symptoms of hypokalemia were observed. One patient developed hyperuricemia and had to be withdrawn from the study.", 
    "22": "Sotalol is a pure beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. The present study was divided into a first and second therapy period. A total of 38 patients with atrial or ventricular arrhythmias were included in the first therapy period. After a drug-free period of approximately two months, 14 of the 38 patients entered the second therapy period and were given oral sotalol. During the two treatment periods, oral sotalol was given in doses ranging from 40 to 480 mg/day for 0.5 to 11 months in the first period and for four to nine months in the second period. Oral sotalol decreased or abolished arrhythmias in 92 per cent of the patients in the first therapy period and in all the patients in the second therapy period. Minor side effects occurred in two patients. Sotalol possesses a unique class III antiarrhythmic action. The electrophysiological profile is different from other beta-adrenergic blocking agents in that sotalol prolongs the duration of the intracellularly recorded action potential. This property may contribute to the antiarrhythmic efficacy demonstrated with sotalol.", 
    "23": "1 Bendrofluazide (10 mg/day) or labetalol (300 mg and 600 mg/day) produced significant reductions in lying, standing, and post-exercise blood pressure in ten hypertensives. 2 Active treatments were approximately equivalent in anti-hypertensive effect. However, comparing lying and standing determinations, labetalol (600 mg/day) produced significantly greater additional postural falls in systolic blood pressure than during placebo or bendrofluazide treatment. 3 Systolic blood pressure rose after exercise during placebo or bendrofluazide treatment. However, on labetalol, mean changes in systolic blood pressure after exercise were negative and significantly different from those seen on placebo. 4 Greater reductions in lying and post-exercise systolic blood pressure were produced by combination treatment than by either individual drug. Additional postural and exercise-related falls in systolic blood pressure tended to be smaller with combination treatment than during treatment with labetalol alone. 5 Labetalol significantly reduced lying, standing, or post-exercise heart rate by comparison with placebo or bendrofluazide. 6 Labetalol significantly reduced lying, standing, or post-exercise heart rate by comparison with placebo or bendrofluazide. 6 Labetalol moderately reduced plasma renin activity, whereas bendrofluazide caused marked elevation. The effect of bendrofluazide predominated during combination treatment.", 
    "24": "Patients with idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) have supernormal left ventricular systolic function at rest. Septal myotomy/myectomy reduces outflow obstruction and symptoms. However, it has been proposed that operation causes myocardial damage, with consequent reduction in left ventricular function and potentially deleterious long-term consequences, despite relief of symptoms. To evaluate the effect of myotomy and mylectomy on left ventricular function, we employed noninvasive radionuclide cineangiography at rest and during maximal exercise in21 consecutive patients with IHSS, before and 6 months after operation. In 30 normal subjects, the ejection fraction (EF) was 57 +/- 2% at rest and 71 +/- 2% during exercise. Before operation in patients with IHSS, the EF was supernormal at rest (76 +/- 2%, p less than 0.001), and normal during exercise (71 +/- 3%, NS). All patients improved from NYHA functional class III-IV preoperatively to class I-II postoperatively; the maximal provocable gradient invariably diminished (average, 100 +/- , mm Hg preop, 33 +/- 9 mm Hg postop, p less than 0.001). Postoperatively, the EF at rest was 67 +/- 2%, still supernormal, but less than that noted preoperatively (p less than 0.001). During exercise, the EF was 66 +/- 4%, only mildly diminished (p less than 0.01) from that preoperatively. We conclude that muscle resection during myotomy and myectomy usually does not cause any important impairment of global left ventricular function at rest or during exercise stress.", 
    "25": "Addition of adenosine (10-7 to 10-4 M) to the tear side of isolated corneas (Rana catesbeiana) produced a rapid, sustained increase in short-circuit current, potential difference, and radioisotopic chloride net flux. The increased net chloride flux accounted for the increased short-circuit current. Adenosine, a known activator of adenyl cyclase in other tissues, exerted its effects on chloride transport through a receptor different from the one described for epinephrine and prostaglandins in the corneal epithelium. Propranolol inhibited the epinephrine response but not the adenosine effect. Dipolyphloretin phosphate inhibited prostaglandin responses but did not affect the adenosine stimulation of chloride transport. Adenine and/or ribose, parts of the adenosine molecule, had no stimulatory effect, but 5'-AMP had a partial effect. The activation of the chloride pump with DBcAMP blocked the response to adenosine. Adenosine interacted with the effects of theophylline. Adenosine, a naturally occurring molecule, stimulated chloride transport by activation of adenyl cyclase through a separate membrane receptor in the corneal eqithelium.", 
    "26": "Our previous finding that increasing myocardial contractility caused reflex systemic hypotension, the left ventricular (LV) mechanoreceptor reflex, suggested that the classical Bezold reflex (systemic hypotension and bradycardia after intracoronary administration of veratrum alkaloids) may be initiated by these same LV mechanoreceptors. In our working LV preparation with the coronary and systemic circulations isolated and perfused separately, intracoronary injection of veratrum alkaloids, like that of catecholamines or ouabain, had a positive inotropic effect which produced the hypotensive response typical of the LV mechanoreceptor reflex. To test directly if veratridine's positive inotropic effect initiates the Bezold reflex, verapamil, which blocks the slow Ca(2+) channels of myocardial cells but leaves intracardiac nerves unaffected, was injected by the intracoronary route to prevent the increased contractility from intracoronary injection of veratridine which also abolished the reflex hypotension, demonstrating conclusively that increasing myocardial contractility and thereby activating LV mechanoreceptors but not chemoreceptors initiates the Bezold reflex. Contrariwise, decreasing contractility or cardiac asystole by administration of tetrodotoxin, verapamil, or EDTA resulted in an increase in the systemic resistance, indicating that changes in the magnitude of the stimulus initiating the LV mechanoreceptor reflex (i.e., changes in myocardial contractility) lead to directionally opposite changes in peripheral resistance, as in the sino-aortic mechanoreflexes. Thus, it is concluded that the Bezold reflex is a special case of the LV mechanoreceptor reflex. The latter, by means of feedback mechanisms, functions normally by continuously matching the peripheral resistance to the LV contractile state so as to maintain the arterial pressure constant, thereby playing an important role in blood pressure regulation.", 
    "27": "A patient found to have a pheochromocytoma in the 16th wk of pregnancy was successfully managed by medical treatment with phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride and propranolol. In the 38th wk of pregnancy she was electively delivered by cesarean section, and the tumor was simultaneously removed.", 
    "28": "In 12 patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease and three normal persons, comprehensive analyses of the electrocardiographic changes associated with symptom-limited upright exercise are made by computer analysis of the electrocardiogram recorded using a Frank XYZ lead system. This analysis provided a display of the 12 lead ECG, vectorcardiogram, polarcardiogram, and spatial cardiogram and measurements of spatial magnitudes of heart vectors. The effect of 40 mg of oral propranolol was assessed by repeating the exercise protocol 60--90 min later. There is evidence that propranolol reduces the electrocardiographic features of myocardial ischemia. This reduction in myocardial ischemia correlates with reductions in pressure rate product and heart rate. The presence of infarct criteria with exercise is variable and not apparently influenced by propranolol.", 
    "29": "Isolated rat lung parenchymal strips responded to carbachol, 5-HT and phenylephrine (PE) with contractions. Bradykinin (BK), histamine, PGF2 alpha, PGE1, PGE2 and dimaprit were either inactive or produced weak relaxations. Isoproterenol, noradrenaline (NA) and epinephrine (E) relaxed lung strips. The further increase in their concentrations produced contractions of varying magnitudes. The lung strips contracted to 5-HT or carbachol, responded to isoproterenol and E and NA with relaxations. Metiamide and cimetidine (selective histamine H2-receptor antagonists) did not alter responses to histamine and carbachol. Propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker) antagnoized or reversed relaxations to E and isoproterenol, and markedly enhanced contractions to NA, PE and E. Atropine and phentolamine or dibenzyline antagonized contractions to carbachol and sympathomimetic agents, respectively. From study it may be concluded that there are alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors mediating contractions and relaxations in the peripheral airways of rat.", 
    "30": "Sotalol (Sotalex), 320 or 960 mg, was administered to 12 healthy subjects daily for a period of four days in a double-blind trial over 11 days. The effects of sotalol on heart rate, blood pressure, EEG, subjective quality of sleep, polygraphically determined sleep pattern, and psychophysiological parameters such as psychomotor performance, memory, perception, vigilance, and general condition were studied and were related to dosage and plasma levels. Steady-state plasma levels of sotalol were reached within 24 hours after a single dose; 960 mg resulted in plasma levels three times higher than those reached with 320 mg, which indicates first-order linear absorption. The effects of sotalol on EEG, sleep, and performance in psychological tests were equivocal and do not yield evidence for CNS activity of sotalol.", 
    "31": "The effects of guanosine and of five guanine nucleotides on sinus rate and contractile force were investigated using the isolated, blood-perfused dog atrium preparation. Guanosine consistently induced a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect which was not suppressed by treatment with a potent beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, carteolol. GMP, GDP and CTP induced a biphasic chronotropic and inotropic effect. The potencies for inducing the positive effects of GMP, GDP and GTP were almost the same. However, their rank order of potency for inducing negative effects was GTP greater than or equal to GDP greater than GMP. The negative responses to GTP were not inhibited by atropine. Cyclic GMP and dibutyryl cyclic GMP produced only slight negative chronotropic and inotropic effects but not consistently even at larger doses. The positive chronotropic and inotropic responses to norepinephrine were not modified by treatment with dibutyryl cyclic GMP.", 
    "32": "The beta 1-adrenergic receptors of turkey erythrocyte membranes have been identified by binding of the radioactively labeled antagonist (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol, solubilized by treatment of the membranes with the detergent digitonin, and purified by affinity chromatography. Binding of (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol to the membranes occurred to a single class of non-cooperative binding sites (0.2--0.3 pmol/mg protein) with a equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 8 (+/- 2) nM. These sites were identified as the functional, adenylate-cyclase-linked beta 1-adrenergic receptors on the basis of: firstly, the fast association and dissociation binding kinetics at 30 degrees C; secondly, the stereospecific displacement of bound (--)-[3H]dihydroalprenolol by beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists; and thirdly, the order of potencies for agonists to displace bound tracer (isoproterenol congruent to protokylol greater than norepinephrine congruent to epinephrine) similar to the one found for adenylate cyclase activation, and typical for beta 1-adrenergic receptors. Treatment of the membranes with the detergent digitonin solubilized 30% of the receptors in an active form. Digitonin solubilized also adenylate cyclase activity with a yield of 20 to 30%, provided the membranes were first treated with an effector known to produce a persistent active state of the enzyme: e.g. sodium fluoride. Binding sites for guanine nucleotides ([3H]p[NH]ppG) were solubilized as well. Their concentration (24 pmol/mg protein) was in large excess over the concentration of solubilized receptors (0.30--0.45 pmol/mg protein). Solubilized receptors were purified 500--2000-fold by affinity chromatography with a 25 to 35% yield, using an alprenolol-agarose affinity matrix. Affinity purified receptors were devoid of measurable adenylate cyclase activity and guanine nucleotide binding sites, thus showing that receptors and adenylate cyclase are distinct membrane constituents, and that guanine nucleotides apparently do not bind directly to the receptor molecules. Membrane-bound, solubilized and purified receptors were sensitive to inactivation by dithiothreitol, but not by N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that receptors are at least partly constituted of protein molecules, with essential disulfide bonds.", 
    "33": "The effect of catecholamines on membrane-associated protein kinase in the mature human erythrocyte was investigated. Protein kinase activity was assayed after isolation of membranes from intact erythrocytes incubated with and without catecholamines. Activation of the enzyme is expressed as the ratio of the extent of phosphorylation of exogenous protein substrate in the absence to that in the presence of 2.5 microM cyclic AMP (cAMP). The potent beta-adrenergic agonist, (-)isoproterenol (2 microM), (-)epinephrine (10 microM) and (-)norepinephrine (10 microM) stimulated the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in membranes, 38 +/- 7%, 31 +/- 6%, and 30 +/- 6%, respectively. Maximal stimulation of membrane protein kinase by 10 microM (-)epinephrine was obtained approximately equal to 30 min after initiation of the incubation of erythrocytes with the hormone. The concentrations of (-)catecholamines that gave half-maximal stimulation of the membrane protein kinase were 0.17 microM for isoproterenol, 0.35 microM for epinephrine, and 0.63 microM for norepinephrine. The membrane protein kinase response to beta-adrenergic agonists was found to be stereospecific. The stimulation of membrane protein kinase by 10 microM (-)epinephrine was inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist, (-)propranolol with EC50 = 0.60 microM, and the inhibition of agonist stimulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase by propranolol was stereospecific. These studies suggest that a functional beta-adrenergic receptor exists in the mature human erythrocyte.", 
    "34": "Two hundred consecutive catheterized patients with unstable angina pectoris were reviewed to find clinical and noninvasive indicators of left main coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% lesion). Thirty-five patients (17.5% of total) had left main coronary artery disease. There were no differences between patients with and without left main coronary artery disease in age, sex, results of resting electrocardiogram, congestive heart failure, dyspnea during pain, duration of longest pain, arrhythmias, response to medical therapy, or other risk factors. Crescendo angina pectoris (worsening of pre-existing angina), transient ST-segment depression with pain, simultaneous anterior and inferior ST changes during pain, and fluoroscopic calcification of the left main coronary artery were all significantly more common in patients with left main coronary artery disease. However, low sensitivity or low predictive value, or both, limit the usefulness of these clinical predictors. Left main coronary artery disease cannot be reliably predicted in patients with unstable angina pectoris before coronary arteriography.", 
    "35": "The aim of the study was to investigate whether the beta blocking agent, practolol, is able to modify some of the metabolic and hormonal responses and the local myocardial changes evoked by an excess of adrenaline similar to that seen after acute coronary occlusion. Adrenaline (1.2 micrograms/kg/min) and practolol (1 mg/kg) were infused concurrently to anaesthetized intact dogs for 5 h. Blood free fatty acid and triiodothyronine levels were measured initially and after 2, 4 and 5 h of infusion. At the end of the infusion the myocardium was subjected to biochemical, histoenzymatic and electron microscopic examination. The results were compared with those obtained in dogs infused with adrenaline alone and with saline alone. Practolol reduced the adrenaline-induced increase in free fatty acids and a fall in triiodothyronine in the blood. Myocardial acetate accumulation and ATP decrease were both reduced by practolol. Histoenzymatic and electron microscopic changes were less. These effects of practolol upon systemic and myocardial disturbances induced by the excess of adrenaline indicate that it might be effective in modifying any excessive adrenergic response which may occur in acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "36": "The results of perspective follow-up (in the duration of 19 months) of 92 patients with unstable angina pectoris treated by nonoperative methods are discussed. During hospital stay all patients received propranolol (inderal) in a mean dose of 240mg daily and preparations of depo-nitroglycerin. In most patients the treatment was conductive to marked clinical improvement in their condition. In a follow-up period of one month myocardial infarction developed in 6.7% of patients, mortality was 3.4%. It is concluded that the syndrome of unstable angina pectoris, although associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction developing, is not an \"incurable\" condition. The use of nitroglycerin and adrenergic beta-blocking agents provides for the stabilization of the condition of most patients.", 
    "37": "Guidelines for a step-wise plan of treatment of tachycardias have been compiled based on clinical empirical experience and with the aid of surface electrocardiograms, intracardial electrograms and stimulation techniques. The plan is primarily with the aid of surface electrocardiograms, intracardial electrograms and stimulation techniques. The plan is primarily oriented with respect to the antiarrhythmic efficacy, the adverse reactions and the practicability of the respective agents. Any type of tachycardia, including premature atrial or ventricular contractions, may be regarded as indication for treatment. Treatment is not indicated only in those asymptomatic patients with rare and evanescent tachycardias and in those with less than 300 premature contractions per hour. Beta-adrenergic blockers are the drugs of choice for the persistent sinus tachycardia. Should the latter agents be contraindicated, propafenon, amiodarone or aprindine may be administered. Verapamil and/or digitalis are indicated only for suppression of paroxysmal sinus tachycardias. Atrial premature contractions are best managed with guinidine or disopyramid. An acute reduction of rapid ventricular rates associated with atrial tachycardias, atrial flutter or fibrillation can best be attained through the administration of verapamil prior to digitalis or beta-adrenergic blockers. Re-establishment of sinus rhythm and prophylactic suppression of the latter should be undertaken with quinidine or disopyramid in combination with digitalis and/or either a beta-adrenergic blocker or intravenously-administered verapamil. Verapamil is the drug of choice for initial management of AV-junctional tachycardia for which a combination with digitalis may be considered. An alternative combination is that of a beta-adrenergic blocker and digitalis. For the acute treatment of ventricular tachycardias, lidocain has proved most effective. Although ajmaline and/or propafenon may be given should no response be obtained, electrical cardioversion would be more appropriate. To prevent ventricular tachycardia or when treatment is indicated for ventricular premature beats, ajmaline, propafenon, quinidine, disopyramid or mexiletine, occasionally in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocker should be employed. Verapamil and/or ajmaline, are usually very effective for termination of reciprocal tachycardias. Ajmaline or propafenon in combination with a beta-adrenergic blocker is recommended for the prophylactic treatment of reciprocal tachycardia. In patients who additionally have bradycardia, prolonged QT-intervals or pre-excitation syndromes, the guidelines should be modified accordingly.", 
    "38": "Rats were maintained on ad lib food and a forced-intake regimen of ehtanol for up to 270 days. The ethanol treatment induced alterations in the metabolism of central catecholamines seen as increased endogenous concentrations of dopamine concomitantly with decreased concentrations of noradrenaline in the limbic forebrain. The synthesis of catecholamines, measured as the accumulation of dopa following inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, was unchanged during chronic ethanol treatment. Local application of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens caused a greater increase in locomotor activity in chronic ethanol rats than in controls thus indicating that chronic ethanol treatment increased the sensitivity at or beyond central dopamine receptors. This phenomenon of functional dopamine receptor supersensitivity was first observed after 5 months of ethanol treatment and lasted for about 4 weeks after cessation of the ethanol treatment. The sensitivity of noradrenergic and cholinergic receptor mechanisms appeared to be unchanged after chronic exposure to ethanol. The effect of the GABAergic drug, gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) on the accumulation of dopa after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase was studied in chronic ethanol rats. The enhancement of the dopa formation in dopaminergic neurons induced by GBL was markedly attenuated after chronic ethanol treatment. The gross behavioural depression by GBL was also weakened. This may indicate that chronic ethanol treatment causes subsensitivity of GABA receptors.", 
    "39": "Pindolol was administered orally (5 mg 8th-hourly) to 30 patients 5--19 (mean = 9.0 hrs) hours after onset of acute myocardial infarction. There were no serious side effects during the acute phase of infarction, only one hospital death and two late deaths at follow-up 2--82 (mean = 37 wks) weeks after hospital discharge. In contrast to healthy volunteers, patients with acute infarction had unpredictable absorption of pindolol from the gastrointestinal tract; this was attributable in part to concurrent administration of narcotic analgesics.", 
    "40": "8-Acetonyloxy-5-[3-(2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-ethylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxyl]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril (OPC-1427), is a newly synthesized cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent and we examined the effects of this compound given intraperitoneally to consious Kyoto Wistar normotensive (WKR), spontaneous hypertensive (SHR) and DOCA-NCl hypertensive (DOCA rat) rats. The results were compared to findings with propranolol and practolol. OPC-1427 produced a significant hypotensive action in SHR and DOCA rats and this effect was less in WKR. With propranolol and practolol effective hypotensive effects were seen in WKR and DOCA rats but not in the SHR. The efficacy of the hypotensive action of these agents was propranolol greater than OPC-1427 = practolol in WKR, OPC-1427 greater than practolol in SHR, and OPC-1427 greater than practolol = propranolol in DOCA rats. Thus OPC-1427 appears to be a promising beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent which exerts a hypotensive state, as demonstrated in hypertensive rats.", 
    "41": "The antiarrhythmic effects of dl'propranolol, d-propranolol, metoprolol and lidocaine against ouabain-induced cardiac arrhythmias were studied. It was found that contrary to earlier findings in the dog, the effects of the adrenergic beta-blockers against ouabain-arrhythmias in guinea pigs were due to beta-blocking activity and not the membrane-stabilizing activity of the compounds. The cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol, was more or equally effective as dl-propranolol against ouabain-induced arrhythmias in guinea pigs.", 
    "42": "Rats with experimental renovascular hypertension were treated with high doses of beta-blocking agents. Pindolol 10 mg/kg per day increased Goldblatt-type hypertension, whereas Propranolol 100 mg/kg per day showed an antihypertensive effect. A linear correlation between the weight of the left-heart ventricle and the systolic blood pressure was found in animals treated with Pindolol as well as in untreated Goldblatt rats. On the contrary, the weights of the left-heart ventricle were significantly higher in those animals treated with Propranolol than in the other groups. The results show that Pindolol in high doses, possibly on account of its sympathomimetic activity, leads to an increase in Goldblatt hypertension, but does not influence the pressure-dependent progression of left-heart hypertrophy. On the other hand, Propranolol, possibly on account of a cardiodepressory effect, leads to a decrease in blood pressure.", 
    "43": "The effect of ethanol on adrenaline-stimulated glucose uptake by rat white adipose tissue has been examined in vitro. Ethanol (3%) inhibited the stimulatory effect of adrenaline on glucose uptake whereas it failed to inhibit the effect of adrenaline on free fatty acid production. Addition of calcium (12.5 mM) to the incubation medium restored adrenaline's effect on glucose uptake. Addition of propranolol also restored the effect of adrenaline inhibited by ethanol. Ethanol did not inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These results suggest that ethanol modifies the coupling of the adrenoceptor to the glucose transport system in adipose tissue that is stimulated by adrenaline.", 
    "44": "Propranolol, phenobartitone, diphenylhydantoin, amphetamine, imipramine and propoxyphene have been tritiated using tritiated water and platinum catalyst (from the dioxide and sodium borohydride), and the pattern of labelling has been ascertained by 3H n.m.r. spectroscopy. The results show that this exchange procedure can lead to satisfactory incorporation of tritium at 'stable' aromatic positions. For imipramine where incoroporation of tritium was low, an alternative acid-catalysed procedure was satisfactory.", 
    "45": "Although deleterious events following abrupt withdrawal of antihypertensive treatment are relatively uncommon, considerable attention has recently been focused on this problem. A withdrawal syndrome may occur after termination of almost all types of antihypertensive drugs, but most experience has been with the centrally acting agents and with beta-adrenoreceptor blockers. Abrupt discontinuation of high doses of centrally acting drugs such as alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and guanabenz can produce a syndrome of sympathetic overactivity that includes agitation, headache, sweating, and nausea and less commonly can provoke rapid upswings in blood pressure. If beta blockers are suddenly stopped, a similar pattern can occur that may be related to excessive activity of thyroid hormones as well as sympathetic factors. Additionally, patients with ischemic heart disease may be susceptible to an acute exacerbation of their cardiac disease when beta-blocker treatment is stopped. It seems likely that discontinuation events can be particularly severe when combinations of different types of antihypertensive medications are sud-disease when betablocker treatment is denly stopped. This problem can be dealt with by educating patients to avoid sudden drug cessation and when elective discontinuation is planned, by gradual dose reduction.", 
    "46": "The hemodynamic effects of 20 mg Bufuralol-HCl and of 15 mg Propranolol given to hypertensives i.v. at rest and under physical exercise conditions were examined. It could be shown that Bufuralol-HCl lowered the diastolic BP and PR at rest already in the acute experiment, contrary to Propranolol. Under physical exercise conditions the diastolic BP is lowered, the PR remains unchanged in spite of reduced CO. After exclusion of other possible explanations, Bufuralol-HCl may lower the diastolic BP acutely at least partly by inhibition of cerebral beta-receptors. A faster and better liquor diffusion could be the reason for these results. It can be assumed that the acute BP lowering effect is mediated by the same mechanism as the chronic effect of the other beta-receptor blocking drugs.", 
    "47": "Three groups of glaucoma patients, treated topically with various beta-blocking agents, were studied for mucocutaneous side-effects of long-term therapy. In five of eleven patients with ocular and/or periocular dermatitis as an adverse reaction to long-term treatment with metoprolol eye drops a dermatitis, reproducible by patch tests with pure metoprolol 3%, was demonstrable. Histopathological examination of positive patch tests examined in three cases showed a picture compatible with a delayed type of hypersensitivity. Four atenolol treated patients showed adverse reactions, but negative patch tests to atenolol were found. In addition new data are reported in favour of cross-reactivity between certain beta-blocking agents.", 
    "48": "1 We have studied the effects of single oral doses of 80 mg propranolol and 100 mg metoprolol on the cardiovascular and respiratory responses to progressive exercise in nine healthy men in double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment. As judged by their effects on exercise heart rate and cardiac output the doses of the two drugs used were equivalent. 2 Beta-adrenoceptor blockade reduced oxygen consumption by 3.5% over the whole work range with an increase in the respiratory exchange ratio of 0.056 units. Carbon dioxide production and exercise ventilation were unchanged. The two drugs had similar effects. Possible mechanisms for these observations are discussed. 3 Perceived exertion during exercise was increased by both the beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and this may be of relevance to the symptom of fatigue reported by patients on these drugs. Endurance, assessed as either total work done or maximal work achieved, was reduced by 15%.", 
    "49": "The haemodynamic effects of a new beta 1-receptor agonist, 1-(4 hydroxyphenoxy) 3-isopropylamino-2-propanol, were studied in 25 patients after acute myocardial infarction using non-invasive methods. The drug caused an increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, without change in diastolic blood pressure, and a slight increase in heart rate and reduction in the pre-ejection period. These changes were greater in patients without a history of left heart failure. It is suggested that this cardioselective drug possesses positive inotropic activity but only slight positive chronotropic activity. The substance has been further investigated as a possible antidote to unwanted cardiac side effects of the cardioselective beta-blocker, metoprolol. The changes in the cardiovascular dynamics caused by metoprolol in patients with acute myocardial infarction were promptly reversed by this new beta 1-agonist. With its positive inotropic properties and its efficacy in reversing the effects of a cardioselective beta-blocker, the drug is a potentially useful pharmacological agent to support an acutely depressed myocardium in patients on beta-blocking agents.", 
    "50": "The effects of 4 beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs on blood pressure and on exercise tachycardia were compared in a within-patient study of patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension. Twelve patients were treated with propranolol, practolol and atenolol and 7 of the same patients also received oxprenolol. Each patient received each drug separately, withdrawing each drug before starting the next, and each patient was titrated to the lowest attainable blood pressure and heart rate with each compound. All 4 drugs caused reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in the heart rate induced by exercise. The maximum reduction by each drug in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was the same. There were small but significant differences in the effects on heart rate between those drugs which had intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and those which did not have this property.", 
    "51": "1. Chronic hypertension was induced in Wistar rats with intact kidneys by subcutaneous implantation of 50 mg of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) in wax and addition of sodium chloride (9 g/l) to the drinking water. 2. The development of DOCA/salt hypertension, as monitored by tail-cuff plethysmography, was prevented by: (a) destruction of the peripheral adrenergic nerves with neonatal administration of guanethidine (80 mg/kg subcutaneously for the first 14 days postnatally); (b) bilateral stellate ganglionectomy; (c) oral administration of the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists propranolol or atenolol (1 mg day-1 kg-1) during the period of DOCA/salt treatment. 3. The dose of DOCA used was sufficient to inhibit the atrial Uptake2 pathway completely: this process appears to participate in termination of action of neurally released noradrenaline in the heart. 4. It is suggested that this model of DOCA/salt hypertension is due to adrenergic enhancement of cardiac output in the presence of an increased sodium load. The enhancement may be partly due to deficient myocardial inactivation of noradrenaline.", 
    "52": "Frontal cerebral cortex brain samples from schizophrenics and controls have been assayed for binding associated with muscarinic cholinergic, serotonin (5HT), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and beta-adrenergic receptors as well as for the activity of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). Binding levels of tritium-LSD, presumably associated with postsynaptic 5HT receptors, were reduced 40% to 50% in samples from schizophrenics in three independent studies, whereas no other consistent alteration was observed in levels of binding associated with other receptors or in the activity of GAD. This change in receptor binding levels does not seem to be attributable to postmortem changes, to influence of drugs received by the patients, or to demographic features of the patient populations.", 
    "53": "Development of beta-receptor desensitization in leucocytes of asthmatics and normals during oral therapy with terbutaline was established by means of in vitro stimulation with terbutaline and isoproterenol. This desensitization disappeared about one week after oral therapy was discontinued. In addition no difference in stimulation pattern, measured as increase in intracellular c-AMP content, was determined between asthmatics and normals when both were not receiving therapy. Even when the asthmatics showed strong bronchial hyperreactivity no difference was found. These results do not support the beta-adrenergic blockade hypothesis of Szentivanyi.", 
    "54": "A recent publication suggested that antinuclear antibodies (ANA) occur in up to one third of patients treated with the hypotensive drug prazosin (Minipress). We have examined a large group of hypertensive patients and found ANA in 9.7% of 145 patients taking prazosin and in 12.2% of hypertensive patients on any treatment regimen. Excluding patients taking methyldopa (a drug associated with a high ANA incidence), the ANA incidence fell to 6.9% in the prazosin-treated group and to 7.2% of all treated hypertensives. Of over 350 untreated hypertensive patients, 6.0% had ANA. Prazosin did not increase the ANA incidence in patients on or off various drug combinations including beta blockers and diuretics. Analysis of the data by age and sex confirmed our conclusion that prazosin therapy is not accompanied by an increase in ANA.", 
    "55": "The effect of age on sensitivity to both isoproterenol and propranolol has been investigated in 27 male volunteers aged 21 to 73 yr. The dose of isoproterenol (given as a rapid intravenous injection) required to increase the resting heart rate by 25 bpm (I25) increased with age. The I25 was repeated during an intravenous infusion of propranolol and the dose ratio (I25 after propranolol divided by the control I25) determined. This was related to the concentration of free propranolol in plasma. It was found that the effectiveness of any given free concentration diminished progressively with age. These data are consistent with a diminished responsiveness of the beta-adrenoceptor to both agonist and antagonist drugs with advancing years.", 
    "56": "Nadolol, a recently developed noncardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker, has the potential advantages of a longer oral half-life (t 1/2) than propranolol and, in animal studies, markedly fewer direct myocardial depressant effects. Neither the relative intravenous potency of nadolol and propranolol nor the comparative effects of the 2 drugs on left ventricular performance has been studied in man. We compared equiblocking intravenous doses of nadolol and propranolol in 10 subjects with ischemic wall-motion disorders. Nadolol was on the average 6.2 times as potent on a milligram-for-milligram basis. Both drugs decreased resting heart rate (p less than 0.02) and produced small rises in both mean pulmonary artery (p less than 0.03) and mean pulmonary artery wedge (p less than 0.03) pressures without significantly reducing the cardiac output. Both drugs also produced depression of the radionuclide ejection fraction (p less than 0.002). There were no significant differences between the effects of the 2 drugs on any of the aforementioned variables. Thus, the effects of nadolol on left ventricular performances are similar to those of propranolol. Because of its long oral t 1/2, nadolol may prove to be a clinically useful drug.", 
    "57": "Two hundred and ninety-six patients were admitted to geriatric medical beds in Cardiff in 1976 with acute central chest pain. One hundred and eighty-six (63 per cent) had a confirmed acute myocardial infarction. Of the 37 per cent without evidence of cardiac infarction, 32 per cent were on beta-blocking drugs. The possible role of adrenergic blocking agents in producing acute central chest pain is discussed."
