We conducted a prospective randomized study to investigate the effects of continuous infusion of landiolol on hemodynamic responses to various stimuli, changes in systemic and cerebral hemodynamics during anesthesia, and recovery from anesthesia in patients undergoing craniotomy.", 
    "1": "Thirty patients undergoing elective craniotomy were randomly divided into two groups: a landiolol group and a control (saline) group. Landiolol was administered as an infusion rate of 0.125 mg/kg/min for 1 min, followed by an infusion at 0.01-0.04 mg/kg/min until 6 h after the end of anesthesia. Maximal values of heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in response to tracheal intubation, pin fixation, the beginning of operation, and extubation were compared between groups. Tissue oxygen index (TOI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), and stroke volume index (SVI) before, during, and at the end of operation were compared between groups. Total doses of fentanyl, interval for the recovery from anesthesia, and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) were also compared.", 
    "2": "Maximal values of HR at intubation and pin fixation and of HR and SBP at extubation were significantly less in the landiolol group compared with those in the control group. TOI, MAP, CI, and SVI were similar between groups during anesthesia. Total doses of fentanyl were significantly less in the landiolol group than in the control group. Interval for recovery from anesthesia and incidence of PONV were similar between groups.", 
    "3": "This study indicates that continuous infusion of landiolol suppressed hyperdynamic responses to stimuli during anesthesia while maintaining arterial blood pressure and cerebral oxygen balance during craniotomy.

Landiolol was administered intravenously with an initial dose of 2.5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1), which was doubled if it was ineffective, up to a maximum dose of 80 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Landiolol inhibited ES in 33 patients (79%) at a mean dose of 7.5+/-12.2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). All patients in whom landiolol was ineffective died of arrhythmia. Of the 33 patients in whom landiolol was effective, 25 survived and were discharged (60% of all patients). Landiolol significantly decreased heart rate (P<0.0001), but did not affect blood pressure.

The oxidation ability of two pre-eminent, eco-friendly electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs), namely anodic oxidation (AO) and electro-Fenton (EF), has been compared at lab-scale by carrying out bulk electrolyses at pH 3.0 at constant current using a carbon-felt cathode able to electrogenerate H(2)O(2) in situ. The studies of single component aqueous solutions were focused on atenolol as a model beta-blocker. The AO process was proven much more effective using a large surface area boron-doped diamond (BDD) anode than a Pt one, which was explained by the great amount of active hydroxyl radicals (BDD(OH)) and the minimization of their parasitic reactions. The EF process with a Pt anode and 0.2 mmol l(-1) Fe(2+) showed even higher performance, with fast destruction of atenolol following pseudo-first order kinetics and fast mineralization because the oxidation process in the bulk allows overcoming the mass transport limitations. The time course of the concentration of the aromatic and short-chain carboxylic acid intermediates demonstrated the progressive detoxification of the solutions. Almost 100% of the initial N content was accumulated as NH(4)(+). Multicomponent solutions containing atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol, which usually occur together in the aquatic environment, were treated by EF using the Pt/carbon felt cell. A high mineralization rate was observed up to the overall total organic carbon (TOC) removal, which allowed reducing the energy consumption. The absolute rate constant for the reaction of each beta-blocker with OH was determined and the reactivity was found to increase in the order: atenolol (1.42 x 10(9) l mol(-1) s(-1)) < metoprolol (2.07 x 10(9) l mol(-1) s(-1)) < propranolol (3.36 x 10(9) l mol(-1) s(-1)).",

However, hypertension and taychardia by sympathetic stimulation frequently occur during 420C whole body thermal preconditioning (TP). We aimed to develop a modified TP to achieve cardiovascular protection with to reduced cardiovascular stimulation in the rat. We used a progressive thermal preconditioning (PTP) with three-step 5-min immersion of male Wistar rats in 42 degrees C bath water. Treatment with phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenergic blocker) and atropine (muscarinic cholinergic blocker) was used to evaluate the effect and mechanism of PTP on systemic hemodynamics. Protective function was evaluated by FeCl3-induced acute femoral arterial occlusion (TTO) and heat shock protein 70 expression. Our results show that TP enhanced body temperature, hypertension and tachycardia. However, PTP produced a similar increase in body temperature with significantly less enhancement of hypertension and tachycardia when compared with the TP group. TP- or PTP-induced increase of blood pressure and heart rate was inhibited by phentolamine and propranolol, respectively. PTP-induced attenuation of changes in hemodynamic parameters was via alpha- and beta-adrenergic inhibition. FeCl3 induced femoral arterial injury indicated by TTO at 416 +/- 51 sec in the control rats. After 24 h of TP or PTP treatment with or without adrenergic blocker treatment, TP or PTP upregulated similar femoral arterial heat shock protein 70 expression and significantly (P < 0.05) delayed FeCl3-induced femoral TTO to a similar degree. PTP may provide vascular protection against oxidative injuries with less activation in alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated hypertension and beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated tachycardia.",

This syndrome may be triggered by various events in patients with a genetic predisposition. Patients usually have a normal baseline QT interval. Some of the factors that may prolong the interval are exposure to common drugs such as antibiotics or agents used for general anesthesia. Diagnosis of the condition is essential, as is knowledge of how to manage anesthesia and prevent ventricular fibrillation, which is the most feared complication. We report the case of a man with no relevant medical history who underwent emergency surgery for a peritonsillar abscess.

Treatment of PTSD presents a challenge on every level. This literature review provides some insight into the risks and benefits of three groups of drugs commonly prescribed for combat-induced PTSD: beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs). When prescribed in conjunction with other non-pharmacological treatments, these drugs help to minimize, and in some cases eliminate, the signs and symptoms of PTSD. Combination therapy would ideally result in better compliance and eventual completion of treatment programmes provided for PTSD sufferers. Healthcare professionals strive to provide patients with holistic care. Patients present with unique mental and physical intricacies, and nurses and health professionals must peel away the layers to uncover the nature of the PTSD. While there are many aspects to PTSD treatment, this literature review focuses on pharmacological treatment, specifically beta-blockers, SSRIs and BZDs.",

There was a significant increase in cardiac index and a significant decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at 24 and 48 h for both dobutamine and levosimendan. The improvement in cardiac index with levosimendan was not significantly different from dobutamine at 24 h (P = 0.07), but became significant at 48 h (0.44 +/- 0.56 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.63 L/min/m(2); P = 0.04). At 24 h, the reduction in the mean change in PCWP from baseline was similar for levosimendan and dobutamine, however, at 48 h the difference was more marked for levosimendan (-3.6 +/- 7.6 vs. -8.3 +/- 6.7 mmHg; P = 0.02). No difference was observed between the groups for change in NYHA class, beta-blocker use, hospitalizations, treatment discontinuations or rescue medication use. Reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was significantly greater with levosimendan at 48 h (P = 0.03). According to physician's assessment, the improvement in fatigue (P = 0.01) and dyspnoea (P = 0.04) was in favour of dobutamine treatment, and hypotension was significantly more frequent with levosimendan (P = 0.007).

Plasma concentrations of each drug and, where applicable, its active metabolite were measured using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters and their standard deviations were computed for each analyte.", 
    "26": "Comparative bioavailability was computed and no drug-drug interactions and no difference in comparative bioavailability were concluded for each ingredient based on point estimates of the T/R ratio of the geometric means falling within 80-125% for peak plasma concentration (C(max)), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration (AUC(t)), and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)). The T/R ratio for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose-normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin, the T/R point estimates for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) for Ln-transformed data were significantly lower ( approximately 3-4%) than the lower bound of 80%. For its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, these estimates were significantly higher ( approximately 25-35%) than the higher bound of 125%. Thus, the increased bioavailability of active simvastatin acid appeared to compensate for the loss of bioavailability of simvastatin.",

In line with clinical observations the class III antiarrhythmic drugs (+/-)-sotalol, E4031 and class I antiarrhythmic drug quinidine led to a prolongation of the cardiac repolarization phase (FP duration, FPdur) and a decrease of the FP frequency. Verapamil (a class IV antiarrhythmic drug) decreased the FP frequency and shortened FPdur. Both, quinidine and verapamil, but not (+/-)-sotalol or E4031 decreased conduction velocities in hESCM clusters. Moreover, (+/-)-sotalol exerted stronger effects on FPdur in early developmental stages of hESCMs, as proof for a reduced repolarization reserve. The EC(50) of the (+/-)-sotalol-induced prolongation of the FPdur was higher in mESCMs than in hESCMs implying species-dependent differences in cardiac repolarization. Likewise, the incidence of drug-induced early recurrent depolarization (ERDs) was higher in mESCMs than hESCMs.",

    "31": "The infralimbic cortex (IL) regulates the consolidation of extinction learning for fear conditioning. Whether the IL influences the consolidation of extinction learning for cocaine self-administration is unknown. To address this issue, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 2 wk of cocaine self-administration followed by extinction training. On the first 5 d of extinction, rats underwent brief (15- or 30-min) extinction sessions and received intra-IL microinjections immediately after each extinction session. On days 6-12 of extinction, rats underwent full-length (2-h) extinction sessions that were used to assess the retention of the extinction learning from the short sessions. IL inactivation via microinjections of the GABA agonists baclofen and muscimol (BM) immediately after the extinction sessions (days 1-5) impaired the retention of extinction learning. Control experiments demonstrated that this effect was not due to inactivation of the prelimbic cortex or due to effects of the drugs on the subsequent day's behavior. In contrast, post-training intra-IL microinjections of the allosteric AMPA receptor potentiator 4-[2-(phenylsulfonylamino)ethylthio]-2,6-difluorophenoxyacetamide (PEPA) enhanced retention of the extinction learning. As evidence suggests a role for the beta-adrenergic receptors in memory consolidation, other rats received microinjections of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist clenbuterol or antagonist ICI-118,551 (ICI). Post-training intra-IL administration of clenbuterol or pre-training administration of ICI enhanced or impaired, respectively, the retention of extinction learning. These data indicate that the IL, and specifically the glutamatergic and beta-adrenergic systems in the IL, regulates the consolidation of extinction of cocaine self-administration and that the IL can be manipulated to influence the retention of extinction.",

Oestrogen and oestrogen receptor modulators increase the activity of large conductance Ca(2+)/voltage-sensitive K(+) (Maxi-K; K(Ca)1.1) channels, but the effects of BPA on Maxi-K channels are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that BPA activates Maxi-K channels through a mechanism that depends upon the regulatory beta1 subunit.",

In AD-293 cells with Maxi-K channels composed of alpha subunits alone, 10 microM BPA did not affect channel activity. When channels in AD-293 cells contained beta1 subunits, 10 microM BPA increased channel activity. Effects of BPA were rapid (<1 min) and reversible. A higher concentration of BPA (100 microM) increased Maxi-K current independent of the beta1 subunit.",

    "36": "Elevated dopamine levels are believed to contribute to the rewarding sensation of ethanol (EtOH), and previous research has shown that strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in the nucleus accumbens (nAc) are involved in regulating dopamine release and in mediating the reinforcing effects of EtOH. Furthermore, the osmoregulator taurine, which is released from astrocytes treated with EtOH, can act as an endogenous ligand for the glycine receptor, and increase extracellular dopamine levels. The aim of this study was to address if EtOH-induced swelling of astrocytes could contribute to elevated dopamine levels by increasing the extracellular concentration of taurine. Cell swelling was estimated by optical sectioning of fluorescently labeled astrocytes in primary cultures from rat, and showed that EtOH (25-150 mM) increased astrocyte cell volumes in a concentration- and ion-dependent manner. The EtOH-induced cell swelling was inhibited in cultures treated with the Na(+) /K(+) /2Cl\u207b cotransporter blocker furosemide (1 mM), Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase inhibitor ouabain (0.1 mM), potassium channel inhibitor BaCl\u2082 (50 \u00b5M) and in cultures containing low extracellular sodium concentration (3 mM). In vivo microdialysis performed in the nAc of awake and freely moving rats showed that local treatment with EtOH enhanced the concentrations of dopamine and taurine in the microdialysate, while glycine and \u03b2-alanine levels were not significantly modulated. EtOH-induced dopamine release was antagonized by local treatment with the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine (20 \u00b5M) or furosemide (100 \u00b5M or 1 mM). Furosemide also prevented EtOH-induced taurine release in the nAc. In conclusion, our data suggest that extracellular concentrations of dopamine and taurine are interconnected and that swelling of astrocytes contributes to the acute rewarding sensation of EtOH.", 
    "37": "Betablockers still represent widely prescribed drugs as they cover a wide spectrum of cardiovascular indications. Obviously, it is not trivial which betablocker to choose as they differ both with regard to their pharmacodynamic (e. g. selective vs. nonselective, beta vs. beta + alpha blocking activities) and pharmacokinetic profiles. Latter is largely governed by the metabolic properties, and, thus, their excretion route (renal or biliary route in unchanged or metabolized form). In the elderly population, the stability of plasma concentrations is particularly essential as this population has smaller compensatory tolerance to concentration variations than younger patients. The interaction potential of betablockers with regard to drug-drug, gene polymorphism-drug, excreting organ-drug interactions varies widely between individual substances. Compounds predominantly metabolized by polymorphic cytochromes such as CYP 2D6 are affected by the metabolizer status and competing compounds utilizing the same metabolic pathways can strongly influence plasma levels (examples metoprolol [CAS 37350-58-6], carvedilol [CAS 72956-09-3]). On the other hand, metabolically stable compounds which are predominantly excreted renally may be unfavourable as their plasma concentrations largely depend on renal function which may be blunted in elderly patients. The prototype of this category, atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7), has been associated with inferior results in mortality trials in hypertension treatment. Thus, a favourable compound should be partially stable in regard to metabolism to depend less on drug-drug and gene-drug interactions, but also utilize more than one routes of excretion, meaning both the direct renal and the metabolic routes. The prototype for this type of betablocker is bisoprolol (CAS 66722-44-9).", 
    "38": "We present the core information from the \"Reappraisal of European Guidelines on Hypertension Management\", an official document of the European Society of Hypertension updating the current guidelines of 2007 based on the new knowledge that became available over the last two years. The division of antihypertensive agents into 5 main groups remains unchanged. The key discussion is about whether the treatment of hypertension in high-risk patients should be initiated already at high normal blood pressure and whether the target value should be 130 mm Hg and less. Both objectives are just speculative at present as they have not been confirmed in a large clinical study. Thanks to the HWET study we have more evidence for the benefits of hypertension therapy in older patients. Substantial part of the document focuses on combination therapy; the most encouraged combination is an ACE inhibitor + Ca blocker, or, alternatively, an ACE inhibitor or AII antagonist + diuretic. The beta-blocker + diuretic and ACE inhibitor + AII antagonist combinations are not recommended. Statins should be included in the therapy of all patients with hypertension, antiaggregation as a secondary prevention.", 
    "39": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a great concern to the selection of new drug candidates. While in vitro screening assays for DDI are a routine procedure in preclinical research, their interpretation and relevance for the in vivo situation still represent a major challenge. The objective of the present study was to develop a novel mechanistic modeling approach to quantitatively predict DDI solely based upon in vitro data. The overall strategy consisted of developing a model of the liver with physiological details on three subcompartments: the sinusoidal space, the space of Disse, and the cellular matrix. The substrate and inhibitor concentrations available to the metabolizing enzyme were modeled with respect to time and were used to relate the in vitro inhibition constant (K(i)) to the in vivo situation. The development of the liver model was supported by experimental studies in a stepwise fashion: (i) characterizing the interactions between the three selected drugs (R-bufuralol (BUF), bunitrolol (BUN), and debrisoquine (DBQ)) in microsomal incubations, (ii) modeling DDI based on binary mixtures model for all the possible pairs of interactions (BUF-BUN, BUF-DBQ, BUN-DBQ) describing a mutual competitive inhibition between the compounds, (iii) incorporating in the binary mixtures model the related constants determined in vitro for the inhibition, metabolism, transport, and partition coefficients of each compound, and (iv) validating the overall liver model for the prediction of the perfusate kinetics of each drug determined in isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) for the single and paired compounds. Results from microsomal coincubations showed that competitive inhibition was the mechanism of interactions between all three compounds, as expected since those compounds are all substrates of rat CYP2D2. For each drug, the K(i) values estimated were similar to their K(m) values for CYP2D2 indicative of a competition for the same substrate-binding site. Comparison of the performance between the novel liver physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and published empirical models in simulating the perfusate concentration-time profile was based on the area under the curve (AUC) and the shape of the curve of the perfusate time course. The present liver PBPK model was able to quantitatively predict the metabolic interactions determined during the perfusions of mixtures of BUF-DBQ and BUN-DBQ. However, a lower degree of accuracy was obtained for the mixtures of BUF-BUN, potentially due to some interindividual variability in the relative proportion of CYP2D1 and CYP2D2 isoenzymes, both involved in BUF metabolism. Overall, in this metabolic interaction prediction exercise, the PBPK model clearly showed to be the best predictor of perfusate kinetics compared to more empirical models. The present study demonstrated the potential of the mechanistic liver model to enable predictions of metabolic DDI under in vivo condition solely from in vitro information.", 
    "40": "Pituitary adenomas produce the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12) and its receptor, CXCR4. A recent study indicated that CXCL12 and CXCR4 are concomitantly up-regulated in hypoxia. The objective of this study was to analyze the molecular mechanism of hypoxia-mediated CXCR4 up-regulation and assess the effect of pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 by the receptor blocker, AMD3100, on pituitary function. CXCR4 expression in pituitary adenoma tissues was determined by a tissue microarray analysis of 62 pituitary adenoma samples. CXCR4 expression was significantly elevated and positively correlated with Knosp grade in pituitary adenomas (P < 0.005), and was higher in macroadenoma and growth hormone (GH)-producing adenomas. Pre-operative serum GH levels were significantly correlated with CXCR4 levels in the microarray (P < 0.0001). The relative expression of genes/gene categories that were modulated by up-regulated CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling was determined by a comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and CXCR4-knockdown cells in normoxia and hypoxia using the rat GH-producing and prolactin-producing pituitary adenoma cell line, GH3. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-PCR) showed that CXCR4 mRNA expression in GH3 cells was increased by hypoxia (1% oxygen), and a cDNA microarray analysis revealed that inhibin \u03b2-C expression was diminished. siRNA-mediated CXCR4 knockdown blocked the hypoxia-induced decrease in inhibin \u03b2-C mRNA expression, as did inhibition of CXCR4 activity with AMD3100. An ELISA study demonstrated that GH secretion by wild-type GH3 cells was moderately enhanced by hypoxia and further potentiated by exposure to recombinant SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 protein. Conversely, hypoxia-induced GH secretion was reduced in CXCR4-silenced cells and in cells treated with the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, notwithstanding the presence of SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12 protein. These latter observations reflect the failure of hypoxia to suppress expression of inhibin \u03b2-C in cells deficient in CXCR4 or in which CXCR4 signaling was blocked. Together, these results indicate that the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling pathway interfaces with the classical endocrine pathway to up-regulate GH production via suppression of inhibin \u03b2-C. Because it blocks CXCR4 and prevents hypoxia-induced down-regulation of inhibin \u03b2-C expression, AMD3100 has promise as a molecular-targeting agent in the treatment of GH-producing adenomas.",

    "46": "In guinea-pig cardiomyocytes, a cAMP-dependent Cl(-) current (I(Cl,cAMP)) flows through a cardiac isoform of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which belongs to a family of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. Although several K(+)-channel openers and sulfonylurea ATP-sensitive K(+) (K(ATP))-channel blockers reportedly inhibit I(Cl,cAMP), effects of nicorandil on the Cl(-) current have not been evaluated. This study was conducted to examine the effects of nicorandil on I(Cl,cAMP) in isolated guinea-pig ventricular cells using patch clamp techniques. Nicorandil in concentrations higher than 300 microM enhanced the I(Cl,cAMP) preactivated by 0.1 microM isoproterenol. The isoproterenol-induced I(Cl,cAMP) was inhibited by 100 microM glibenclamide, but not by 100 microM pinacidil. SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine, 10 microM), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, similarly enhanced the isoproterenol-induced I(Cl,cAMP). However, SG-86, a denitrated metabolite possessing K(+ )channel-opening action, failed to enhance the Cl(-) current. When the I(Cl,cAMP) was activated by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 30 microM), either nicorandil or SNAP failed to enhance the isoproterenol-induced I(Cl,cAMP). Thus, nicorandil enhances I(Cl,cAMP) in guinea-pig cardiomyocytes through an increase in intracellular cGMP, although direct modulation of I(Cl,cAMP) by NO cannot be completely excluded.",

Overall mortality was 51% in EVL and 33% in PPL group (p=0.17). Patients in the EVL group showed a lower rate of esophageal variceal bleeding (5.1% v/s 25%, p=0.027) and a higher rate of subcardial variceal bleeding compared with PPL group (7.7% v/s 0%, p=0.027).

    "52": "Full-length amyloid beta peptides (Abeta(1-40/42)) form neuritic amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and are implicated in AD pathology. However, recent transgenic animal models cast doubt on their direct role in AD pathology. Nonamyloidogenic truncated amyloid-beta fragments (Abeta(11-42) and Abeta(17-42)) are also found in amyloid plaques of AD and in the preamyloid lesions of Down syndrome, a model system for early-onset AD study. Very little is known about the structure and activity of these smaller peptides, although they could be the primary AD and Down syndrome pathological agents. Using complementary techniques of molecular dynamics simulations, atomic force microscopy, channel conductance measurements, calcium imaging, neuritic degeneration, and cell death assays, we show that nonamyloidogenic Abeta(9-42) and Abeta(17-42) peptides form ion channels with loosely attached subunits and elicit single-channel conductances. The subunits appear mobile, suggesting insertion of small oligomers, followed by dynamic channel assembly and dissociation. These channels allow calcium uptake in amyloid precursor protein-deficient cells. The channel mediated calcium uptake induces neurite degeneration in human cortical neurons. Channel conductance, calcium uptake, and neurite degeneration are selectively inhibited by zinc, a blocker of amyloid ion channel activity. Thus, truncated Abeta fragments could account for undefined roles played by full length Abetas and provide a unique mechanism of AD and Down syndrome pathologies. The toxicity of nonamyloidogenic peptides via an ion channel mechanism necessitates a reevaluation of the current therapeutic approaches targeting the nonamyloidogenic pathway as avenue for AD treatment.",

Physical modification is simple and cheap because it requires no chemicals or biological agents. The aim of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of a spray dried glutinous rice starch (SGRS) produced from pregelatinized GRS. The surface morphology changed from an irregular to concave spherical shape as revealed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). SGRS was almost amorphous as determined by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The water molecules became linked through hydrogen bonds to the exposed hydroxyl group of amorphous SGRS as determined by Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Then, SGRS formed a colloid gel matrix with water and developed a highly viscous gelatinous form as determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and a stress control type rheometer. In addition, SGRS can swell and produce a gelatinous surface barrier like a hydrophilic matrix biopolymer which controls drug release. Therefore, a novel application of SGRS is as a sustained release modifier for direct compression tablets in the pharmaceutical industry.", 
    "54": "The results of cell monolayer permeation experiments are often affected by concentration dependent cellular processes, such as active transport and metabolism. The rigorous analysis of the concentration dependence of these processes is often limited by the lack of knowledge of the actual concentration at the site of action because the measurement of the local concentration is seldom feasible. However, the local concentrations can be estimated if the rates into and out of a particular location are known. Thus, an insight into the distribution of the permeation resistance in the in vitro cell monolayer permeation experiments would enable the estimation of local concentrations during the permeation experiments and, consequently, a more thorough analysis of the concentration dependent processes involved in the transepithelial transfer of compounds. In this study, a compartmental model was constructed applicable for dissecting the roles of apical and basal side aqueous boundary layers and the cell membranes in the total permeation barrier for weakly acidic and basic compounds. The model was applied for the analysis of the Caco-2 permeation data of three high permeability compounds, propranolol, metoprolol and ibuprofen. Furthermore, the effects of extracellular pH and the agitation conditions on the local concentrations of these compounds were evaluated.", 
    "55": "This study has examined whether upregulation of endothelin receptor A, leptin and phosphorylated protein kinase Cvarepsilon contributes to stress-induced testicular damaged and its possible reversal by endothelial (ET) antagonism. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control and isoproterenol (ISO 1mg/kg, subcutaneous (s.c.), 10 days) groups, and intervened with the ET receptor antagonist CPU0213 (20mg/kg, s.c.), on days 6-10. In ISO group, testicular succinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, acid phosphotase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and serum testosterone decreased, whereas FSH increased, relative to control. The seminiferous tubules were damaged in association with testicular upregulation of protein abundance of leptin and pPKCvarepsilon, and mRNA and protein expression of leptin receptor (OBRb) and ET(A). CPU0213 was effective in ameliorating these abnormalities. Over-expression of ET(A) and leptin accounting for the testis dysfunction is likely to be mediated by pPKCvarepsilon in the ISO treated rats. The upregulated ET pathway appears to be critical in pathologies of the testis.",

Contemporary outcomes are acceptable using the large-scale randomized trials as a metric of success. Class I and II data can be applied to improve the care process of patients undergoing CEA. Myocardial infarction remains the most significant nonstroke complication; however, there is no significant benefit to noninvasive stress testing in patients with clinically stable disease. Perioperative beta-blockade may offer up to a 10-fold reduction in the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, but deleterious effects are attributable to high-dose regimens. Angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis by up to 25%, although few studies have examined these agents directly in carotid surgery patients. Statins are beneficial to patients undergoing CEA with trials demonstrating up to a 3% absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke following CEA. Aspirin therapy is associated with an up to 7% absolute reduction in early stroke following CEA; however, the efficacy of combination or high-dose antiplatelet therapy remains ill-defined. A treatment strategy that involves perioperative medical optimization is likely to improve surgical outcomes and long-term cardiovascular risk for patients undergoing CEA.",

After I or I/R, 2-cm jejunal segments were mounted in an organ bath to study neurogenic contractions stimulated by electrical pulses or KCl using a digital recording system. Thin jejunal slices were stained hematoxylin and eosin for analysis by optical microscopy. Compared to the sham group, the jejunal contractions were similar in the I + AT and the I/R + AT groups, but reduced in the I + SS and the I/R + SS groups. The jejunal enteric nerves were damaged in the I + SS and the I/R + SS groups, but not in the I + AT and the I/R + AT.

    "74": "The K(+) channel blocker, TEA is known to increase action potential amplitude and insulin secretion of mouse beta-cells when added to a nutrient secretagogue. In the presence of a maximally effective sulfonylurea concentration (2.7 microM glipizide) the nutrient secretagogue alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC, 10mM) strongly increased insulin secretion (about elevenfold). Instead of enhancing the effect of KIC, TEA reduced the KIC-induced secretion by more than 50%. Also, the secretion rate produced by 2.7 microM glipizide alone was significantly reduced by TEA. In contrast, TEA enhanced the insulinotropic effect of glipizide when a basal glucose concentration (5mM) was present. In the presence as well as in the absence of glucose glipizide produced a plateau depolarization with superimposed action potentials. Under both conditions, TEA increased the glipizide-induced action potential amplitude and further elevated the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) with an oscillatory characteristic. These effects depended on the activity of L-type Ca(2+) channels, even though the effect of TEA differed from that of 1 microM of the Ca(2+) channel opener, Bay K8644, which primarily increased action potential duration. TEA did not negatively affect parameters of beta-cell energy metabolism (NAD(P)H fluorescence and ATP/ADP ratio), rather, it slightly increased NAD(P)H fluorescence. Apparently, TEA inhibits insulin secretion in the absence of glucose in spite of a persistent ability to block K(+) ion conductance. Thus, the signalling role of action potential depolarization in insulin secretion may require reconsideration and ion conductance-independent actions of K(+) channels may be involved in this paradox effect of TEA.",

In order to evaluate the effect of one of such prominent flavonoids, morin, on P-glycoprotein related efflux carriers, measurements of transport characteristics through Ussing chambers, in situ perfusion and in vivo drug absorption studies were performed with the transported, yet not metabolized model compound talinolol.This study investigated the effects of orally administered morin (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1)), on the pharmacokinetics of orally (10 mg kg(-1)) and intravenously (1.0 mg kg(-1)) administered talinolol in rats. In the presence of morin, the pharmacokinetic parameters of talinolol were significantly altered in the oral group but not in the intravenous group. The presence of 2.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1) of morin significantly increased (1.8-2.0 fold, p<0.01) the area under the plasma concentration-time curve and the peak plasma concentration (2.3-3.0 fold, p<0.01) of orally administered talinolol. The absolute bioavailability (F %) of talinolol in the rats pretreated with morin was significantly higher (89.09-98.29%, p<0.01) than the control (52.14%). Talinolol demonstrated asymmetric transport across rat ileum with significantly greater basolateral-to-apical (B-A) permeability than that in the apical-to-basolateral (A-B) direction. The addition of morin resulted in a concentration dependent effect, especially on the secretory transport of talinolol.The present study demonstrates that morin bears the ability to interfere with secretory intestinal transport processes.

Numerous trials have evaluated the effect of perioperative beta-blockers on MI, stroke, bradycardia, hypotension, overall mortality, and cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing NCS. Several trials suggest that dosing, patient population, type of NCS, genetic polymorphisms, and type of anesthesia may be important in determining the benefits and risks of perioperative beta-blockade in these patients. In the meta-analyses evaluating beta-blockers in NCS, the balance of benefits to harms associated with aggressive perioperative beta-blocker therapy was not favorable. However, the largest, most recent trial drove the meta-analyses results and has some methodological caveats and limitations that must be considered.

The study was carried out on fasted male anaesthetized dogs divided into five groups [5 dogs per group]. Each dog was given a bolus injection of normal saline, caffeine [6 mg/kg] caffeine after pretreatment with prazosin [0.2 mg/kg], caffeine after pretreatment with propranolol [0.5 mg/kg] or caffeine after pretreatment with a combination of prazosin [0.2 mg/kg] and propranolol [0.5 mg/kg]. The experiments were carried out under resting and exercising conditions of the hindlimb. Hindlimb glucose uptake [HGU] was calculated as the product of blood flow and arterio-venous glucose difference. Blood glucose was determined by the glucose oxidase method and blood flow to the hindlimb was determined by time-collection method. The results showed that pretreatment of the animal with either prazosin or propranolol significantly reduced caffeine-induced hyperglycemia, glucose extraction and hindlimb glucose uptake at rest. The two blockers also separately reduced caffeine-induced hyperglycemia during contraction of the hindlimb. Prazosin or propranolol did not however influence the effect of caffeine on glucose extraction and hindlimb glucose uptake during contraction of the hindlimb. It was therefore concluded that alpha and beta adrenergic receptors are involved in caffeine induced responses at rest and not during hindlimb contraction.",

Experiments with intracellular electrochemistry show that vesicles cannot uptake new catecholamines. There was progressive accumulation of labetalol in secretory vesicles of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, and this beta-blocker was co-released with catecholamines from rat and bovine chromaffin tissues.",

We aimed to differentiate between these functions and to identify differences between spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists with different subtype selectivity or the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier were used to demonstrate beta-adrenoceptor involvement in resting blood pressure and the response to tyramine-induced peripheral norepinephrine release. The centrally acting propranolol (beta(1+2[+3])), CGP20712A (beta(1)), ICI-118551 (beta(2)), and SR59230A (beta(3)), as well as peripherally restricted nadolol (beta(1+2)) and atenolol (beta(1)), were administered intravenously, separately, or in combinations. Blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, total peripheral vascular resistance, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were evaluated. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists had little effect on cardiovascular baselines in normotensive rats. In hypertensive rats, antagonist-induced hypotension paralleled reductions in resistance, except for atenolol, which reduced cardiac output. The resistance reduction involved primarily neuronal catecholamine, central beta(1)-adrenoceptors, and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Tyramine induced a transient, prazosin-sensitive vascular resistance increase. Inhibition of nerve-activated, peripheral beta(1/3)-adrenoceptors enhanced this alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-dependent vasoconstriction in normotensive but not hypertensive rats. In hypertensive rats, return to baseline was eliminated after inhibition of the central beta(1)-adrenoceptor, epinephrine release (acute adrenalectomy), and peripheral beta(2/3)-adrenoceptors. Adrenalectomy eliminated beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in hypertensive rats, and tyramine induced a prazosin-sensitive vasoconstriction, which was inhibited by combined blockade of central beta(1)- and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, nerve-activated beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation was not present in hypertensive rats, whereas epinephrine-activated beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation was upregulated. There was also a hypertensive, nerve-activated vasoconstrictory mechanism present in hypertensive rats, involving central beta(1)- and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors combined.",

Respiratory support was required for 7 days, inotropic support for 10 days; at the same time propranolol and K-iodide were administered. Eventually, the tachycardia settled and beta-blocker therapy was continued with reduced doses. Finally, the thyroid hormone levels became normal.

In 16 subjects we systematically examined the temporal relationships between respiration, RSA, and blood pressure by graphically portraying cardiac interval (R-R) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) variations as a function of the respiratory cycle (pattern analysis), during incremental stepwise paced breathing. The principal findings were 1) the time interval between R-R maximum and expiration onset remained the same ( approximately 2.5-3.0 s) irrespective of breathing frequency (P = 0.10), whereas R-R minimum progressively shifted from expiratory onset into midinspiration with slower breathing (P < 0.0001); 2) there is a clear qualitative distinction between pre- versus postinspiratory cardiac acceleration during slow (0.10 Hz) but not fast (0.20 Hz) breathing; 3) the time interval from inspiration onset to SBP minimum (P = 0.16) and from expiration onset to SBP maximum (P = 0.26) remained unchanged across breathing frequencies; 4) SBP maximum and R-R maximum maintained an unchanged temporal alignment of approximately 1.1 s irrespective of breathing frequency (P = 0.84), whereas the alignment between SBP minimum and R-R minimum was inconstant (P > 0.0001); and 5) beta(1)-adrenergic blockade did not influence the respiration-RSA relationships or distinct RSA patterns observed during slow breathing, suggesting that temporal dependencies associated with alterations in breathing frequency are unrelated to cardiac sympathetic modulation.

Findings were similar for coronary events. In the ABPM substudy, reduced variability in daytime SBP in the amlodipine group (p<0.0001) partly accounted for the reduced risk of vascular events, but reduced visit-to-visit variability in clinic SBP had a greater effect. In the MRC trial, group SD SBP and all measures of within-individual visit-to-visit variability in SBP were increased in the atenolol group compared with both the placebo group and the diuretic group during initial follow-up (all p<0.0001).

Other potentially informative measures, such as variability in clinic blood pressure or maximum blood pressure reached, have been neglected, and effects of antihypertensive drugs on such measures are largely unknown. Clinical guidelines recommend that episodic hypertension is not treated, and the potential risks of residual variability in blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients have been ignored. This Review discusses shortcomings of the usual blood-pressure hypothesis, provides background to accompanying reports on the importance of blood-pressure variability in prediction of risk of vascular events and in accounting for benefits of antihypertensive drugs, and draws attention to clinical implications and directions for future research.",

    "163": "The authors review the current data on the presence and reported biological effects in fish of some of the most commonly detected pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment; namely nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), fibrates, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), azoles, and antibiotics. Reported biological effects in fish in the laboratory have often been shown to be in accordance with known effects of pharmaceuticals in mammals. Water concentrations at which such effects have been reported, however, are generally, between microg L(-1) and mg L(-1), typically at least 1 order of magnitude higher than concentrations normally found in surface waters (ng L(-1)). There are exceptions to this, however, as for the case of synthetic oestrogens, which can induce biological effects in the low ng L(-1) range. Although generally effect levels for pharmaceuticals are higher than those found in the environment, the risks to wild fish populations have not been thoroughly characterised, and there has been a lack of consideration given to the likely chronic nature of the exposures, or the potential for mixture effects. As global consumption of pharmaceuticals rises, an inevitable consequence is an increased level of contamination of surface and ground waters with these biologically active drugs, and thus in turn a greater potential for adverse effects in aquatic wildlife.", 
    "164": "Chronic heart rate reduction (HRR) therapy following myocardial infarction, using either the pure HRR agent ivabradine or the beta-blocker atenolol, has been shown to preserve maximal coronary perfusion, via reduction of perivascular collagen and a decrease in renin-angiotensin system activation. In addition ivabradine, but not atenolol, treatment attenuated the decline in ejection fraction and decreased left ventricular wall stress. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that cell survival within the infarct region was enhanced by these two pharmacological agents. Four weeks after ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery, the percentage of the LV that contained the infarct was similar in the untreated (MI) rats and those chronically treated with ivabradine (MI + IVA) or atenolol (MI + ATEN). However, the mean thickness (mm) of the ventricular wall containing the scar was significantly greater in the MI + IVA, 1.54 (P < or = 0.01) and the MI + ATEN 1.32, compared to 1.1 in the MI group, due to a 2-fold greater area of surviving cardiomyocytes (P < or = 0.01) in the treated rats compared to the untreated group. Regions of cell survival were usually in the subepicardium, with cardiomyocytes surrounding veins or venules. However, some hearts displayed surviving cells along the endocardium. These data suggest that HRR by either ivabradine or atenolol facilitates a more favorable O2 microenvironment via improved venous flow and decreased O2 demand. We conclude that chronic HRR by these agents may serve to limit infarct expansion and wall thinning and may serve to reduce the potential for ventricular rupture.",

In addition the volume of the CC and the presence or absence of malignant disease were recorded. Mean values (vessel diameters, creatinine) or percentages were calculated and compared for the groups with (n=416) and without (n=2183) a cisterna. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed for all parameters to identify the potential association with the presence and size of a cisterna. In addition the simultaneous influence of the parameter malignancy, cardiovascular disease and age on presence and size of the CC was analyzed in a logistic regression model.",

Using a commercial CE instrument with an 8.5 cm long, 100 microm i.d. reversed phase silica monolithic section and a window 1.5 cm beyond the end of this in a 21.5 cm open section, a minimum plate height of 9 microm was obtained in capillary liquid chromatography (CLC) mode at a low driving pressure of 50 psi. In eCLC mode, high speed and high resolution separations of acidic and basic compounds were achieved with selectivity tuning based on the flexible combination of pressure (0-100 psi) and voltage. Taking advantage of the excellent permeability of silica monolithic columns, use of a step flow gradient enabled elution of compounds with different charge state.",

Nebivolol enhanced endothelium-dependent and sildenafil-induced relaxations of HCC tissue, and produced endothelium-dependent vasodilation of HPRA. Nebivolol, but not atenolol, significantly improved erectile response in diabetic rats (51.6%, 53.2%, and 87.1% of response at 3 Hz in nondiabetic rats, for vehicle-treated, atenolol-treated, and nebivolol-treated diabetic rats, respectively); after sildenafil administration, ED was completely reversed in nebivolol-treated diabetic rats (69.6% and 112% for diabetic rats treated with sildenafil and nebivolol plus sildenafil, respectively).

    "189": "There is accumulating evidence that proteinuria is not merely a biomarker for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but also a mediator of this devastating disorder. Indeed, albumin, one of the major components found in proteinuria, causes proinflammatory and profibrotic changes in cultured proximal tubular cells. Further, numerous studies have demonstrated the active participation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of CKD as well. However, the role of the RAS in albumin-elicited tubular cell damage remains to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we studied whether and how irbesartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, could inhibit albumin-elicited proximal tubular cell apoptosis and injury in vitro. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) increased oxidative stress generation in human cultured proximal tubular cells, which was blocked by the treatment with irbesartan. Irbesartan was also found to block the BSA-induced apoptotic cell death as well as up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA levels in tubular cells. The present study suggests that there could exist a pathophysiological crosstalk between the RAS and albumin overload in proximal tubular cell apoptosis and damage. Blockade of the RAS by irbesartan may play a protective role against tubular cell injury by attenuating the deleterious effects of albumin.",

Phenotyping permits evaluation of real-time, in vivo P-gp activity and P-gp-mediated drug-drug interactions. Digoxin, fexofenadine, talinolol and quinidine are commonly used probe drugs for P-gp phenotyping. Although current regulatory guidance documents highlight methodologies for evaluating transporter-based drug-drug interactions, whether current probe drugs are suitable for phenotyping has not been established, and validation criteria are lacking.

Although we have to control tachycardia, we often have great difficulties in managing these arrhythmias. Many reports have showed landiolol, ultra short-acting beta1 blocker, and amiodarone were effective against postoperative atrial fibrillation. However there has been no report on comparison between these 2 drugs. As excessively sympathetic activity might cause atrial fibrillation, landiolol was introduced into our therapy concomitant with the sedative. Our investigation confirmed that both landiolol and amiodarone were effective in preventing atrial fibrillation, and that the timing of transition from intravenous administration to oral intake was acceptable. When landiolol was administered, enough attention should be paid to the patients whose left ventricular function was low. The patients in whom atrial fibrillation occurred under landiolol therapy showed tendency of lower heart rate in comparison with the patients under amiodarone therapy.", 
    "192": "Recently, some clinical studies have suggested that beta-blockers may prevent atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery. In this study, we administered a low dose of landiolol (ultra short acting beta 1-blocker) by continuous infusion postoperatively to evaluate the effects on prevention of atrial fibrillation and hemodynamic stabilization in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). A total of 30 patients were given landiolol and studied as landiolol group (L group), and 50 patients who had undergone similar operations before were enrolled as control group (C group). Heart rate was significantly lower in L group without any deterioration of hemodynamics or myocardial disorder. Occurrence of atrial fibrillation within the 1st postoperative week in L group was statistically less than that in C group. Continuous infusion of landiolol in low dose has beneficial effects on hemodynamic stabilization, heart rate control, and prevention of atrial fibrillation in post-OPCAB.",

By multilinear regression analysis, no positive risk factors for early subject withdrawals were observed following a Bonferroni correction (p > or = 0.01). A positive correlation was observed for medication errors and protocol violations to withdrawals due to ocular AEs and total administrative errors (p < 0.0001). Protocol violations alone were correlated to subject withdrawals for any AE (total/month) and systemic AEs (p < 0.0001). Females and Caucasians were correlated to medication errors (p < 0 .0001). Among medical therapies, alpha-agonists, beta-blockers, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor/beta-blocker fixed combination and prostaglandins were correlated with systemic AEs (p < or = 0.005) while the alpha-agonists were correlated with withdrawals for poor IOP control (p = 0.00056).",

    "207": "Large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channels are membrane proteins contributing to electrical propagation through neurons. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide found in the trigeminovascular system (TGVS). Both BK(Ca) channels and CGRP are involved in migraine pathophysiology. Here we study the expression and localization of BK(Ca) channels and CGRP in the rat trigeminal ganglion (TG) and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) as these structures are involved in migraine pain. Also the effect of the BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin and the BK(Ca) channel opener NS11021 on CGRP release from isolated TG and TNC was investigated. By RT-PCR, BK(Ca) channel mRNA was detected in the TG and the TNC. A significant difference in BK(Ca) channel mRNA transcript levels were found using qPCR between the TNC as compared to the TG. The BK(Ca) channel protein was more expressed in the TNC as compared to the TG shown by western blotting. Immunohistochemistry identified BK(Ca) channels in the nerve cell bodies of the TG and the TNC. The beta2- and beta4-subunit proteins were found in the TG and the TNC. They were both more expressed in the TNC as compared to TG shown by western blotting. In isolated TNC, the BK(Ca) channel blocker iberiotoxin induced a concentration-dependent release of CGRP that was attenuated by the BK(Ca) channel opener NS11021. No effect on basal CGRP release was found by NS11021 in isolated TG or TNC or by iberiotoxin in TG. In conclusion, we found both BK(Ca) channel mRNA and protein expression in the TG and the TNC. The BK(Ca) channel protein and the modulatory beta2- and beta4-subunt proteins were more expressed in the TNC than in the TG. Iberiotoxin induced an increase in CGRP release from the TNC that was attenuated by NS11021. Thus, BK(Ca) channels might have a role in trigeminovascular pain transmission.", 
    "208": "Adenosine and regadenoson cause an increase in heart rate (HR) during myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). It has been shown that patients with diabetes mellitus have a blunted HR response due to cardiac autonomic dysfunction. It is not known whether the HR response is related to hyperglycemia and the metabolic syndrome (MS). HR changes were assessed in 2,000 patients (643 with diabetes mellitus [DM]) in the Adenoscan Versus Regadenoson Comparative Evaluation for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (ADVANCE MPI 1 and ADVANCE MPI 2) trials in relation to MS status and blood sugar level on the day of MPI. The HR response was lower in patients with MS (32.43 +/- 0.52% vs 36.15 +/- 0.71%, p <0.001). An increase in the number of features of MS was associated with a stepwise decrease in the HR response (-0.92% per MS criterion, p <0.05), irrespective of the presence of DM. Increasing blood sugar levels resulted in blunting of the HR response even after controlling for DM and MS (0.60 +/- 0.08% per 10 mg/dl, p <0.001). MS was independently related to the HR response on top of DM, renal function, left ventricular function, gender, age, baseline HR, blood pressure, and beta-blocker use. The overall model was highly associated with the HR response (p <0.001) and able to explain 30% of its variation. In conclusion, the HR response to adenosine and regadenoson is blunted in patients with hyperglycemia and in those with MS. These results suggest that factors that precede the development of DM may be associated with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and may help explain the contribution of hyperglycemia and MS to cardiovascular risk.", 
    "209": "Landmark studies have proved that several therapies reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, the rates of secondary CVD in the context of therapies delivered according to current guidelines are largely unknown. Therefore, we sought to estimate the incidence of secondary CVD hospitalizations and all-cause mortality among patients who did and did not receive guideline-level pharmacotherapy. For the 12,278 patients added to the Kaiser Permanente, Northwest CVD registry in 2000 to 2005, we used the pharmacy records to define guideline-level care (GLC) as at least one dispense of aspirin/antiplatelets, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers within 6 months after registry enrollment. We followed patients until they died, experienced a CVD hospitalization, or June 30, 2008. We compared the age- and gender-adjusted incidence rates per 1,000 person-years of CVD hospitalization, death, and the composite, and estimated the hazard ratios using Cox regression analysis. During a mean follow-up of 45.8 +/- 22.8 months, 25% of the study sample experienced the composite outcome. The age- and gender-adjusted incidence per 1,000 person-years of the composite outcome was significantly lower among GLC patients (hazard ratio 50.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 46.6 to 54.3) versus non-GLC patients (hazard ratio 60.7, 95% CI 58.1 to 63.4). The difference was driven by lower mortality rates (hazard ratio 18.1, 95% CI 16.1 to 20.4 vs hazard ratio 28.1, 95% CI 26.3 to 30.0). The incidence of CVD hospitalizations did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (hazard ratio 29.2, 95% CI 26.4 to 32.2 vs hazard ratio 27.7, 95% CI 26.0 to 29.5). Multivariate adjustment resulted in a marginally significant 8% lower risk of the composite outcome among GLC recipients (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01, p = 0.067). In conclusion, treatment according to current guidelines was significantly associated with reduced mortality but not the risk of secondary hospitalizations."
