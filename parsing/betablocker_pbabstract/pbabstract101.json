Angiotensin II, which is converted from angiotensin I by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), stimulates ROS production via NADPH oxidase. In stellate cells, angiotensin II activates the stress-activated protein kinase p38. However, the molecular mechanism by which angiotensin II regulates pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis remains to be determined.",

The solubility of carvedilol showed linear increase with increasing concentrations of Gelucire indicating A(L) type solubility diagrams. SDs characterized for physicochemical characteristics using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry revealed transformation of crystalline form of drug to amorphous form which was confirmed by scanning electron micrographs. Further fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results suggested there is no drug carrier interaction. From the dissolution parameters such as mean dissolution time, dissolution efficiency and drug release rate, improved dissolution characteristics for SDs were observed compared with physical mixture and pure drug. Thus SDs of carvedilol in Gelucire 50/13 showed enhanced solubility and dissolution rate compared to pure drug.",

Set A was prepared by a one-step filling method and set B by a multiple-step pore-filling method of CAR into porous silica. The solid dispersions were then characterized using thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen adsorption experiments. The results showed that the drug release can be significantly improved compared with the dissolution of the drug in its pure crystalline or amorphous state. Drug release from solid dispersion was faster when the drug content in the solid dispersion was low, which enabled the drug to be finely dispersed along the hydrophilic carrier's surface. The results also showed that a multiple-step pore-filling procedure is more effective for drug loading as indicated by the absence of a crystalline drug state, greatly reduced porosity, and improved wettability and physical stability of the amorphous CAR.", 
    "10": "A myocardial bridge (MB), partially covering the coronary artery, is a congenital anatomical variant usually present in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). MB causes coronary heart disease (CHD) by 2 distinct mechanisms influenced by the anatomical properties of the MB, such as its length, thickness, and location. One is direct MB compression of the LAD at cardiac systole, resulting in delayed arterial relaxation at diastole, reduced blood flow reserve, and decreased blood perfusion. The other is enhancement of coronary atherosclerosis causing stenosis of the LAD proximal to the MB, occurring because of endothelial injury arising from the abnormal hemodynamics provoked by retrograde blood flow up toward the left coronary ostium at cardiac systole. The magnitude of the effect of the 2 distinct mechanisms of the MB on LAD blood flow is prescribed by a common root of the MB-muscle mass volume generated by those properties. Furthermore, the anatomical properties of the MB are closely associated with the choice of treatment and therapeutic outcome in CHD patients having an MB. Thus, the anatomical properties of an MB should be considered in the diagnosis and management of CHD patients with this anomaly.",

Sixteen men with coronary artery disease participated in this investigation. Ratings of perceived exertion (Borg 6-20 Scale) were estimated during the last 15 sec. of each minute of a progressively incremented treadmill test.

    "19": "Ion Channel-Coupled Receptors (ICCRs) are artificial proteins comprised of a G protein-coupled receptor and a fused ion channel, engineered to couple channel gating to ligand binding. These novel biological objects have potential use in drug screening and functional characterization, in addition to providing new tools in the synthetic biology repertoire as synthetic K(+)-selective ligand-gated channels. The ICCR concept was previously validated with fusion proteins between the K(+) channel Kir6.2 and muscarinic M(2) or dopaminergic D(2) receptors. Here, we extend the concept to the distinct, longer \u03b2(2)-adrenergic receptor which, unlike M(2) and D(2) receptors, displayed barely detectable surface expression in our Xenopus oocyte expression system and did not couple to Kir6.2 when unmodified. Here, we show that a Kir6.2-binding protein, the N-terminal transmembrane domain of the sulfonylurea receptor, can greatly increase plasma membrane expression of \u03b2(2) constructs. We then demonstrate how engineering of both receptor and channel can produce \u03b2(2)-Kir6.2 ICCRs. Specifically, removal of 62-72 residues from the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the receptor was required to enable coupling, suggesting that ligand-dependent conformational changes do not efficiently propagate to the distal C-terminus. Characterization of the \u03b2(2) ICCRs demonstrated that full and partial agonists had the same coupling efficacy, that an inverse agonist had no effect and that the stabilizing mutation E122 W reduced agonist-induced coupling efficacy without affecting affinity. Because the ICCRs are expected to report motions of the receptor C-terminus, these results provide novel insights into the conformational dynamics of the \u03b2(2) receptor.",

An inverse-variance-weighted random-effects model was used to pool results. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios were pooled separately, and HRs were selected as the primary outcome. Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. The pooled mean adherence by drug class ranged from 28% for \u03b2-blockers to 65% for angiotensin II receptor blockers.

The systems were prepared by melting and casting and thoroughly characterized before and after exposure to the release medium. Based on the experimental results, a mechanistic realistic mathematical model was used to get further insight into the underlying drug release mechanisms. Importantly, broad spectra of drug release patterns could be obtained by simply varying the lipid:lipid blend ratio in implants based on Precirol ATO 5 (glyceryl palmitostearate):Dynasan 120 (hardened soybean oil) mixtures loaded with propranolol hydrochloride. Release periods ranging from a few days up to several months could be provided. Interestingly, the drug release rate monotonically decreased with increasing Dynasan 120 content, except for implants containing about 20-25% Precirol, which exhibited surprisingly high release rates. This could be attributed to the incomplete miscibility of the two lipids at these blend ratios: DSC thermograms showed phase separation in these systems. This is likely to cause differences in the implants' microstructure, which determines the mobility of water and dissolved drug as well as the mechanical stability of the systems. Purely diffusion controlled drug release was only observed at Precirol ATO 5 contents around 5-10%. In all other cases, limited drug solubility effects or matrix former erosion are also expected to play a major role. Thus, lipid:lipid blends are very interesting matrix formers in controlled release implants. However, care must be taken with respect to the mutual miscibility of the compounds: in case of phase separation, surprisingly high drug release rates might be observed.",

The current study investigated whether these three activities were linked, and if so, the sequence of activation. Young chicks were trained using either a strongly or weakly reinforced variant of the single-trial discrimination avoidance task, yielding either a persistent or labile memory trace, respectively. Following strongly reinforced training, retention loss induced by a RyR inhibitor was prevented by a NO donor or noradrenaline (NA). A RyR agonist also prevented retention loss induced by either NO synthase or \u03b21+2-adrenoceptor inhibition. These findings were interpreted to reflect the capacity of NO, RyR-dependent calcium release and NA to modulate memory by preventing retention loss. A second set of studies used weakly reinforced training. Although the administration of a RyR agonist promoted long-term memory formation, this facilitation was compromised in the presence of a \u03b21+2-adrenoceptor antagonist, but not a NO synthase inhibitor. Similarly, the inhibition of RyRs interfered with the facilitation of retention induced by a NO donor, but not NA. These differential findings with weakly reinforced training suggest that NO facilitates memory formation through mechanisms involving RyR-dependent calcium release. The findings also indicate that RyRs may promote memory formation through noradrenergic activation of \u03b22-adrenoceptors. This study demonstrates an intricate role for RyRs underlying memory formation.",

    "35": "The secretion of insulin from pancreatic \u03b2-cells is triggered by the influx of Ca(2+) through voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels. The resulting elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) triggers additional Ca(2+) release from internal stores. Less well understood are the mechanisms involved in Ca(2+) mobilization from internal stores after activation of Ca(2+) influx. The mobilization process is known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). In this study, our goal was to investigate the existence of and the role of caffeine-sensitive ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in a rat pancreatic \u03b2-cell line, INS-1 cells. To measure cytosolic and stored Ca(2+), respectively, cultured INS-1 cells were loaded with fura-2/AM or furaptra/AM. [Ca(2+)](i) was repetitively increased by caffeine stimulation in normal Ca(2+) buffer. However, peak [Ca(2+)](i) was only observed after the first caffeine stimulation in Ca(2+) free buffer and this increase was markedly blocked by ruthenium red, a RyR blocker. KCl-induced elevations in [Ca(2+)](i) were reduced by pretreatment with ruthenium red, as well as by depletion of internal Ca(2+) stores using cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) or caffeine. Caffeine-induced Ca(2+) mobilization ceased after the internal stores were depleted by carbamylcholine (CCh) or CPA. In permeabilized INS-1 cells, Ca(2+) release from internal stores was activated by caffeine, Ca(2+), or ryanodine. Furthermore, ruthenium red completely blocked the CICR response in permeabilized cells. RyRs were widely distributed throughout the intracellular compartment of INS-1 cells. These results suggest that caffeine-sensitive RyRs exist and modulate the CICR response from internal stores in INS-1 pancreatic \u03b2-cells.",

We tested the crosstalk between PPARgamma agonist and Beta-3 agonist pathways on lipolysis and NO production in first 24 hours of treatment. Isolated epididymal rat adipocytes were cultivated in DMEM for 24 hours with treatment with Beta-3 agonist - BRL-37344, PPARgamma agonist - troglitazone, PPARgamma antagonist - SR-202 and AMPK blocker - compound C alone as well as in combinations. After 24 hours, lipolysis was measured by free glycerol, NO production by Griess reagent and iNOS mRNA by qRT-PCR. BRL-37344 increased lipolysis and NO production with iNOS transcription. Troglitazone increased all the three parameters as well but less than BRL-37344. Combination of troglitazone or SR-202 with BRL-37344 decreased NO production, iNOS transcription and lipolysis triggered before adding of BRL-37344. Compound C completely blocked the effect of troglitazone (and SR-202 as well) on BRL-37344. PPARgamma agonist/antagonist interferes with Beta-3 agonist activity in 24 hours. Troglitazone/SR-202 effect on Beta-3 triggered lipolysis and iNOS mRNA production is probably not PPAR gamma- but rather AMPK-dependent in first 24 hours (AMPK blocker - compound C blocked the effect).",

Hepatic neovascularization, which is also known to play a pivotal role in liver fibrogenesis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor, were also markedly inhibited. Combination treatment with any two agents exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than any single treatment. Moreover, the triple cocktail treatment revealed further suppressive effects than any two agent combination. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that similar combined effects were observed on the proliferation and TGF-\u03b2 mRNA expression of activated hepatic stellate cells and endothelial cell tube formation. These results indicate that the cocktail combination treatment of clinically used IFN, Rib and ARB may provide a new strategy for anti-liver fibrosis therapy.",

Hence, the present study was designed to develop a transdermal patch containing Glibenclamide and Atenolol using blends of different polymeric combinations such as Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), Poly vinyl pyrolidone (PVP) and Carbopol (CP). The patches were subjected to physicochemical parameters, in-vitro and in-vivo drug release and in-vitro skin permeation studies. Good results were obtained in all the evaluated parameters. The drug release of all formulation follows zero order kinetics by diffusion mechanism of non fickian diffusion type. In-vitro transdermal permeation studies by using rat & goat skin and finally in-vivo studies by using rabbits were carried out for the optimized formulation (GA4 HPMC 1%, PVP 0.5%, CP 0.5%). The developed transdermal delivery system containing Glibenclamide & Atenolol might be a milestone in the combinational therapy of diabetes and hypertension.",

The algorithm employed a stepwise assessment of peak oxygen consumption (VO2), slope of regression relating minute ventilation to carbon dioxide output (VE/VCO2) and peak respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and was proposed as an alternative to the traditional strategy of using a single CPET parameter to describe prognosis. Since its initial proposal, the prognosticating algorithm has not been reassessed, although a re-evaluation is in order given the fact that new HF therapies, such as beta-blocker therapy, have significantly improved survival in HF. The present review, based on a critical examination of CPET outcome studies in HF patients regularly treated with beta-blockers, suggests a new prognosticating algorithm. The algorithm comprises four CPET parameters: peak RER, exertional oscillatory ventilation (EOV), peak VO2 and peak systolic blood pressure (SBP). Compared to previous proposals, the present preliminary attempt includes EOV instead of VE/VCO2 slope as ventilatory CPET parameter, and peak SBP as hemodynamic-derived index.",

For heart failure with preserved systolic function thus far no reduction of mortality or morbidity could be demonstrated in clinical trials. Conversely, prognosis of systolic heart failure has been improved by the introduction of various drugs and devices in recent years. Since the publication of the latest heart failure guidelines, additional results from clinical studies have been obtained, which should be considered in patient treatment. In patients with severe systolic dysfunction the addition of low dose aldosterone antagonists to an ACE inhibitor and betablocker reduced mortality and hospitalizations already in functional class NYHA II. A resting heart rate above 70 bpm is an independent risk factor in systolic heart failure. If this high heart rate persists despite the maximal tolerated betablocker dose, isolated heart rate reduction by ivabradine may lower the rate of hospital admissions due to worsening heart failure. Iron deficiency should be substituted independently of the presence of anemia to improve symptoms and exercise capacity.

PPCM is a rare and potentially life-threatening form of dilated cardiomyopathy with left-ventricular systolic dysfunction that affects women in late pregnancy or in the early puerperium. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The generation of a cardiotoxic prolactin subfragment appears to play a key role in the pathophysiology.

CIH evokes plasticity in cardiorespiratory regulating sites, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which acts to sustain increased sympathetic nerve activity. Our working hypothesis is that vasopressin neurons mediate the sustained increase in blood pressure and altered breathing associated with CIH. In a series of neuroanatomical experiments, we determined if vasopressin-containing PVN neurons innervate rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), and altered cardiorespiratory responses induced by CIH conditioning (8h/day for 10 days) is mediated by vasopressin-V(1A ) receptor signaling in the medulla. In the first set of experiments, cholera toxin \u03b2 subunit was microinjected into the RVLM to delineate innervation of the PVN. Immunohistochemistry data showed vasopressin-containing PVN neurons were double-labeled with cholera toxin \u03b2 subunit, indicating vasopressin projection to the RVLM. In the second set, sections of the medulla were immunolabeled for vasopressin V(1A ) receptor, and its expression was significantly higher in the RVLM and in the neighboring rostral ventral respiratory column in CIH- than from RA-conditioned rats. In a series of physiological experiments,we determined if blocking the vasopressin V(1A )receptor in the medulla would normalize blood pressure in CIH-conditioned rats and also attenuate the evoked responses to PVN disinhibition.Blood pressure, heart rate, diaphragmatic and genioglossus muscle activity were recorded in anesthetized, ventilated and vagotomized rats. The PVN was disinhibited by microinjecting bicuculline before and after blocking vasopressin V(1A ) receptors in the RVLM/rostral ventral respiratory column. In RA-conditioned rats, PVN disinhibition increased blood pressure, heart rate, minute diaphragmatic and genioglossus muscle activity, and these increases were attenuated after blocking the vasopressin V(1A ) receptor. In CIH-conditioned rats, a significantly greater dose of blocker was required to blunt these physiological responses and it also normalized the baseline blood pressure.

Especially,the activity of BK channel (\u03b1+\u03b24) can be modulated by martentoxin, a 37 residues peptide, with Ca(2+)-dependent manner. gBK channel (glioma BK channel) and BK channel (\u03b1+\u03b21) possessed higher Ca(2+) sensitivity than other known BK channel subtypes.",

In the presence of cytoplasmic Ca(2+), martentoxin could enhance the activities of both gBK and BK channel (\u03b1+\u03b21) subtypes in dose-dependent manner with EC(50) of 46.7 nM and 495 nM respectively, while not shift the steady-state activation of these channels. The enhancement ratio of martentoxin on gBK and BK channel (\u03b1+\u03b21) was unrelated to the quantitative change of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentrations though the interaction between martentoxin and BK channel (\u03b1+\u03b21) was accelerated under higher cytoplasmic Ca(2+). The selective BK pore blocker iberiotoxin could fully abolish the enhancement of these two BK subtypes induced by martentoxin, suggesting that the auxiliary \u03b2 subunit might contribute to the docking for martentoxin. However, in the absence of cytoplasmic Ca(2+), the activity of gBK channel would be surprisingly inhibited by martentoxin while BK channel (\u03b1+\u03b21) couldn't be affected by the toxin.", 
    "99": "Thus, the results shown here provide the novel evidence that martentoxin could increase the two Ca(2+)-hypersensitive BK channel subtypes activities in a new manner and indicate that \u03b2 subunit of these BK channels plays a vital role in this enhancement by martentoxin.",

These three drugs represent an appropriate choice for checking whether a methodology based on transient absorption spectroscopy of a given reporter can be employed for discrimination between different distribution patterns in multicompartmental biological media. Thus, upon laser flash photolysis (LFP) of NPX, PPN, and CIN in the presence or absence of proteins, the NP triplet excited state ((3)NP*) at \u223c420 nm was always detected, although the kinetics of the decay traces was structure- and medium-dependent. In aerated PBS, only a very short triplet lifetime (\u03c4(T)) was found (1-2 \u03bcs). By contrast, in the presence of SAs, two longer triplet lifetimes (5-76 \u03bcs) were observed, ascribed to (3)NP* within site I and site II. Upon binding to AAGs, only a long \u03c4(T) (15-47 \u03bcs) was found. When the two proteins were present simultaneously in the same media, fitting of the decay traces was clearly consistent with a distribution of the drug between the different biological compartments and the bulk solution, which correlates well with the known protein affinities of every drug. Experiments were performed in both human (HSA/HAAG) and bovine protein media (BSA/BAAG). The results showed that SAs are the major carriers for NPX; by contrast, PPN binds preferentially to AAGs. An intermediate situation was found for CIN, which presents comparable affinity for both proteins. The results obtained for the two enantiomers of each drug were very similar, although a small stereodifferentiation was observed between the triplet lifetimes in the protein binding sites.",

This study aimed to evaluate the possible role of testosterone in the restoration of normal ejaculatory function in diabetic rats. Male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into 3 experimental groups: control, diabetic (streptozotocin), and diabetic with testosterone supplementation (streptozotocin plus testosterone). The following parameters were assessed at the end of the experiment: body weight, circulating testosterone levels, number of spermatozoa ejaculated in the uterus through natural mating, and weight and in vitro isometric contractions of the vas deferens. Diabetic rats showed reduced plasma testosterone levels and ejaculatory dysfunction as observed by a lack in the spermatozoa ejaculated into the uterus of receptive females. In these diabetic rats, no difference was observed in the sensitivity of the vas deferens to norepinephrine, with or without the presence of the cocktail (cocaine plus propranolol). In spite of this, an increased sensitivity to methoxamine through the \u03b11-adrenoceptor was observed. Testosterone supplementation did not restore these parameters to control values.We conclude that, in this experimental model, the lack of testosterone was not directly related to the diabetes-induced ejaculatory dysfunction.",

Current guidelines recommend using thiazide-type diuretics as first-line therapy alone or in combination with another agent. Other commonly used antihypertensive agents include calcium channel blockers, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren. These agents are associated with varying degrees of evidence that they may provide protection from cardiovascular or renal disease beyond that associated with blood pressure reduction. Thiazide diuretics are inexpensive and effective but may not be preferable to other classes of antihypertensives that reduce blood pressure to a similar extent with a better safety profile and superior reductions in cardiovascular event rates. However, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and direct renin inhibitors also show promise as initial monotherapy or as part of a combination therapy regimen.

    "148": "The hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) are synthetic compounds that have been widely used for the control of pests. The most common HCH isomers are the \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b4-, and \u03b3-HCH. Although the have the same chlorine substitution pattern, the spatial orientation of chlorine atoms is different on each one of them, resulting in unique structures that have distinct molecular properties. Humans are exposed to individual HCH isomers through various routes, including ingestion of contaminated water or food, absorbed through the skin or by inhalation, and because of their liposolubility, these chemicals are mostly stored in fat-containing tissues. The isomer-specific spectrum of biochemical actions for these compounds has been wee characterized for different endpoints such as enzyme activation, calcium homeostasis, gap junctional intercellular communication, endocrine disruption, and cancer, among others. The interaction with the GABA reception has been one of the most extensively studied properties of the HCHs. For instance, \u03b3-HCH acts as a GABAA channel blocker, whereas \u03b1- and \u03b4-HCH potentiate currents , all working as allosteric modulators of the receptor. The changes in calcium homeostasis elicited by HCHs are both isomer and cell type specific. For example, in neurons, both the \u03b4- and \u03b3-isomers of HCH stimulate Ca\u00b2+ influx through different voltage-gated Ca\u00b2+ channels. In human neutrophils, \u03b1-,\u03b4-, and \u03b3-HCH, but not \u03b2-HCH, increase intracellular Ca\u00b2+ concentrations. This isomer-dependent behavior is also similar to that observed for phospholipase A2 activation and also correlates with oxidative stress generation. On the other hand, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that HCHs alter genomic integrity, and, therefore, these compounds have been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans . Finally, HCHs have been reported to be endocrine disrupters. In fact, \u03b3- and \u03b2-HCH have been shown to have weak estrogenic activity, and together with the \u03b1- and the \u03b4-isomer, also interfere with steroidogenesis. In short, the HCH isomers are good examples of structurally related chemicals, for which the geometrical patterns present in each one of the different conformers create structures that possess specific mechanisms of action and toxicological properties.",

Persistence with glaucoma medication was assessed by examination of data (2002 to 2007) from a provincial medical and drug insurance database.", 
    "151": "Patients attending the session had glaucoma for 10 years. They had a better persistence than those who did not attend (P<0.05). Their persistence remained the same 1 year after attending the session but tended to be improved in the first 180 days (P<0.076). During the study period, there was a 4% increase in overall persistence (P<0.05). This could be due to an increase in prostaglandins prescriptions and changes in \u03b2-blockers formulation.", 
    "152": "The information session and patient's recalls had a limited impact on patient persistence. This could be due to the selection of a population already persistent (78.9%). The results could have been different in less persistent patients and new patients. It could be different in another practice setting.", 
    "153": "Noradrenergic (NAergic) A7 neurons that project axonal terminals to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to modulate nociceptive signaling are suggested to receive tonic inhibition from local GABAergic interneurons, which are under the regulation of descending analgesic pathways. In support of this argument, we presently report GABA(B) receptor (GABA(B)R)-mediated tonic inhibition of NAergic A7 neurons. Bath application of baclofen induced an outward current (I(Bac)) in NAergic A7 neurons that was blocked by CGP 54626, a GABA(B)R blocker. The I(Bac) was reversed at about -99 mV, displayed inward rectification, and was blocked by Ba(2+) or Tertipian-Q, showing it was mediated by G protein-activated inward-rectifying K(+) (GIRK) channels. Single-cell RT-PCR results suggested that GIRK1/3 heterotetramers might dominate functional GIRK channels in NAergic A7 neurons. Under conditions in which GABA(A) and glycine receptors were blocked, bath application of GABA inhibited the spontaneous firing of NAergic A7 neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, CGP 54626 application not only blocked the effect of GABA but also increased the firing rate to 126.9% of the control level, showing that GABA(B)Rs were constitutively active at an ambient GABA concentration of 2.8 \u03bcM and inhibited NAergic A7 neurons. GABA(B)Rs were also found at presynaptic excitatory and inhibitory axonal terminals in the A7 area. Pharmacological activation of these GABA(B)Rs inhibited the release of neurotransmitters. No physiological role was found for GABA(B)Rs on excitatory terminals, whereas those on the inhibitory terminals were found to exert autoregulatory control of GABA release.",

The primary endpoint was tolerability, defined as reaching and maintaining guideline-recommended target doses after 12 weeks treatment. Adverse events and clinical parameters of patient status were secondary endpoints. None of the beta-blockers was superior with regards to tolerability: 24% [95% confidence interval (CI) 20-28] of patients in the bisoprolol arm and 25% (95% CI 21-29) of patients in the carvedilol arm achieved the primary endpoint (P= 0.64). The use of bisoprolol resulted in greater reduction of heart rate (adjusted mean difference 2.1 b.p.m., 95% CI 0.5-3.6, P= 0.008) and more, dose-limiting, bradycardic adverse events (16 vs. 11%; P= 0.02). The use of carvedilol led to a reduction of forced expiratory volume (adjusted mean difference 50 mL, 95% CI 4-95, P= 0.03) and more, non-dose-limiting, pulmonary adverse events (10 vs. 4%; P < 0.001).",

Wistar female rats (\u00b1250g) were divided into two groups: sham-operated and ovariectomized. Each group was subdivided into three subgroups: sedentary rats, rats submitted to aerobic trained and rats submitted to resistance training. Ovariectomy did not change arterial pressure, basal heart rate (HR), DAB and BRS responses, but interfered with HRV by reducing the low-frequency oscillations (LF=0.20-0.75Hz) in relation to sedentary sham-operated rats. The DAB showed that both types of training promoted an increase in the predominance of vagal tonus in sham-operated rats, but HR variations due to methylatropine were decreased in the resistance trained rats compared to sedentary rats. Evaluation of BRS showed that resistance training for sham-operated and ovariectomized rats reduced the tachycardic responses in relation to aerobic training. Evaluation of HRV in trained rats showed that aerobic training reduced LF oscillations in sham-operated rats, whereas resistance training had a contrary effect. In the ovariectomized rats, aerobic training increased high frequency oscillations (HF=0.75-2.5Hz), whereas resistance training produced no effect. In sham-operated rats, both types of training increased the vagal autonomic tonus, but resistance training reduced HF oscillations and BRS as well. In turn, both types of training had similar results in ovariectomized rats, except for HRV, as aerobic training promoted an increase in HF oscillations.",

Not only are they being used for their original purpose to treat angina and cardiac arrhythmias, but they are also effective therapeutics for hypertension, cardiac failure, glaucoma, migraine and anxiety. Recent studies suggest that they might also prove useful in diseases as diverse as osteoporosis, cancer and malaria. They have also provided some of the most useful tools for pharmacological research that have underpinned the development of concepts such as receptor subtype selectivity, agonism and inverse agonism, and ligand-directed signalling bias.

    "160": "We checked the mean flow velocity (MFV) of the posterior cerebral artery by transcranial Doppler in 22 migraineurs during a headache-free period and in 14 normal controls. During the photic stimulation, MFV was remeasured and the CVR was estimated in both groups. Migraineurs received prophylactic propranolol for 2 months, and they were then reevaluated for the above-mentioned parameters and assessed for a headache index (HI).", 
    "161": "There were no baseline differences in MFV between migraineurs and controls before treatment. Both groups showed a similar degree of increase in MFV with the photic stimulation, thus CVR was not significantly different between them. After the treatment period, CVR decreased significantly in migraineurs compared to baseline (p<0.01), although MFV remained unchanged. The prophylactic effect of propranolol treatment on symptomatic migraine was demonstrated on the HI, which significantly improved (p<0.05).", 
    "162": "Considering that CVR was decreased but the baseline MFV was not changed in the posterior cerebral artery prior to the visual stimulation in migraineurs after propranolol treatment, we assume that the protective effect of propranolol was not due to the direct effect on the cerebral vessels but due to the modulation of the CVR to sensory stimulation through its action on central centers associated with autonomic vascular tone.",

Because cardiac sarcoidosis has diverse clinical presentations, its diagnosis can be a major challenge for clinicians. It is very rare for the initial manifestation of cardiac sarcoidosis to be sustained ventricular tachycardia, especially in a patient with no prior symptoms or history of the disease. Herein, we discuss the case of a 41-year-old black man who presented with nausea, vomiting, and palpitations on the day after he had consumed alcoholic beverages heavily. Electrocardiographic examination revealed sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

Fifty male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were divided equally into 5 groups. Group I: fed normal chow; served as normal control group. Groups II-V: fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 weeks, followed by injection of streptozotocin (STZ; 35 mg/kg) to create a model of T2DM. Group II: treated with vehicle. Group III: treated with rosiglitazone (4 mg/kg). Group IV: treated with telmisartan (5 mg/kg). Group V: treated with both agents. Untreated HFD-STZ rats showed elevated fasting blood glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and total serum cholesterol (TC), with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and adiponectin levels (p < 0.001). Rosiglitazone exerted more improvement in all parameters than telmisartan did, and a combination of both did not augment the improvement further, except for TGs and adiponectin. For the isolated atrial study, a combination of rosiglitazone and telmisartan corrected the responses of the atria of HFD-STZ rats to the negative inotropic effect induced by adenosine better than either one did alone, whereas this combination, surprisingly, significantly attenuated the positive inotropic response to \u03b2-adrenoreceptor and \u03b1-adrenoreceptor agonists. In conclusion, rosiglitazone significantly improved the metabolic and cardiac dysfunctions in T2DM. Moreover, a combination of rosiglitazone and telmisartan offered more improvement in serum TGs and adiponectin, and restored the atrial inotropic response to adenosine. Surprisingly, this combination significantly attenuates the positive inotropic response to \u03b11-adrenoreceptor and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor agonists.",

In the present study, we investigated whether these polymorphisms influence the acute changes of heart rate and blood pressure induced by the \u03b2(1)-adrenergic receptor-selective blocker atenolol in healthy young Japanese. A double-blind study was conducted with 307 subjects randomly allocated 2:1 to atenolol (50 mg) or placebo groups.

In all, 49% of the patients received the quadruple EBM combination concurrently at discharge. An adjusted model demonstrated that old age, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, cardiac catheterization, as well as cardiologists as care providers and hospitals with cardiac catheterization facilities were all positively correlated with the use of the quadruple EBM combination. However, patients with cardiogenic shock, renal impairment, higher risk score, congestive heart failure, recurrent ischemia, and those admitted to academic hospitals were negatively correlated with the use of the quadruple EBM combination.

    "188": "The release mechanism of metoprolol succinate pellets coated with a blend of a water-insoluble polymer, ethyl cellulose (EC), and a water-soluble polymer, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), is mechanistically explained. The kinetics of drug release and HPC leaching were followed for drug doses. The coating was initially not permeable to the drug, and release started only after a critical amount of the HPC had been leached out. Drug release occurred mainly through pores created in the coating by the HPC dissolution. Single-pellet release experiments were also performed. The coating thickness and size of each pellet were measured. In order to quantitatively characterize the transport properties of the coating of the individual pellets, and to determine the effective diffusion coefficient (D(e)) of the drug in the coating, a mechanistic model was used to fit the single-pellet release data. It was found that D(e) increased with time due to an increase in the amount of HPC leached. It was also found that D(e) was dependent on the coating thickness, and increased more slowly with a thicker coating. This agreed well with the finding that the HPC leaching rate decreased with increasing film thickness.",

The results of a previous study have shown that pindolol potentiates the panicolytic effect of paroxetine in rats submitted to the elevated T-maze (ETM). Since reported evidence has implicated the 5-HT(1A) receptors of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) in the panicolytic effect of antidepressants, rats treated with pindolol (5.0mg/kg, i.p.) and paroxetine (1.5mg/kg, i.p.) received a previous intra-DPAG injection of the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY-100635 (0.4 \u03bcg) and were submitted to the ETM. Pretreatment with WAY-100635 reversed the increase in escape latency, a panicolytic effect, determined by the pindolol-paroxetine combination. These results implicate the 5-HT(1A) receptors of the DPAG in the panicolytic effect of the pindolol-paroxetine combination administered systemically.

Adjusted odds ratios for in-hospital and 30-day postadmission mortality and rate ratios for compliance with the 3 quality-of-care measures were calculated using marginal structural models to assess differences over time. Compliance with the 3 in-hospital quality-of-care measures improved significantly over the 6-year period. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) revealed significant decreases in in-hospital mortality in cohorts eligible for aspirin at arrival (year 6 vs baseline 0.37, 0.22 to 0.65), \u03b2 blockers at arrival (year 6 vs baseline 0.24, 0.11 to 0.52), and an \"all-eligible\" measure comprising aspirin at arrival, \u03b2 blockers at arrival, and timely reperfusion (year 6 vs baseline 0.41, 0.24 to 0.69).

Understanding the opportunities afforded by the combination of RAS blockade with a calcium-channel blocker requires a discussion of basic and clinical science data. One new concept is that of 'global' or total RAS blockade. The impact of the RAS can be diminished or blocked by several different classes of drugs (central sympatholytics, \u03b2-blockers, renin inhibitors, ACE inhibitors or ARBs); what is most important is how effectively the overall impact of angiotensin II is blunted. A second new concept is that the complementary actions of RAS blockers and calcium-channel blockers are best explained on the basis of diminished intracellular calcium availability in excitable tissue (sympathetic neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells) via parallel actions that reduce angiotensin II type-1 receptor stimulation and L-channel-mediated calcium flux. Aliskiren is the first of the direct renin inhibitors, the newest subclass of RAS blockers. In both short- and long-term studies, aliskiren has been shown to be similar in efficacy and tolerability compared with other RAS blockers, with the added benefit that its effects persist longer. Outcome studies with aliskiren are currently underway.", 
    "199": "The aims of this study were to prepare and evaluate chitosan-polyacrylic acid complex (CS-PAA) as polymeric osmogents for swellable micro/nanoporous osmotic pump propranolol tablets.", 
    "200": "The complexes were characterized and evaluated for their swelling characteristics. The selected complexes were incorporated into the core propranolol tablets as polymeric osmogents. The core tablets were formulated, compressed as monolithic and two-layered tablets, and finally coated with cellulose acetate containing PEG 400 and PVP K30 as plasticizers and pore formers, respectively. As a final point, the drug release was determined.", 
    "201": "A direct correlation was found between the CS content in the complex and the maximum swelling force and swelling ratio of the complex mixture. In vitro drug release revealed that the percent drug release increased with the amount of osmogent in the two-layered tablets. Drug release could be prolonged up to 12h and conformed to the USP 31 criteria. In contrast, percent release decreased with the increasing amount of complexes in monolithic tablets. It was postulated that two opposing mechanisms were involved. Following water uptake, the complexes of polymers swelled and pushed the drug out of the tablets, and the drug bound to the polymer network and remained in the tablets.", 
    "202": "The results indicated that the complex of CS-PAA at optimal proportion and amount was a promising polymeric osmogent for a zero-order controlled release from two-layered swellable micro/nanoporous osmotic pump tablets.", 
    "203": "A clear understanding of oral drug absorption is an important aspect of the drug development process. The permeability of drug compounds across intact sections of small intestine from numerous species, including man, has often been investigated using modified Ussing chambers. The maintenance of viable, intact tissue is critical to the success of this technique. This study therefore aimed to assess the viability and integrity of tissue from patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy, for use in cross-species Ussing chamber studies. Electrical parameters (potential difference, mV; short-circuit current, \u00b5A.cm(-2) ; resistance, \u03a9.cm(2) ) were monitored over the duration of each experiment, as was the permeability of the paracellular marker atenolol. The permeability values (Papp; cm/s \u00d7 10(-6) ) for a training-set of compounds, displaying a broad range of physicochemical properties and known human fraction absorbed values, were determined in both rat and human jejunum, as well as Caco-2 cell monolayers. The results indicate that human jejunum sourced from pancreatoduodenectomy remained viable and intact for the duration of experiments. Permeability values generated in rat and human jejunum correlate well (R(2) = 0.86), however the relationship between permeability in human tissue and Caco-2 cells was comparatively weak (R(2) = 0.58). Relating permeability to known human fraction absorbed (hFabs) values results in a remarkably similar relationship to both rat and human jejunum Papp values. It can be concluded that human jejunum sourced from pancreatoduodenectomy is a suitable source of tissue for Ussing chamber permeability investigations. The relationship between permeability and hFabs is comparable to results reported using alternative test compounds.", 
    "204": "Heart failure is an increasingly common disease associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Recent advances in heart failure pharmacotherapy have established several agents as beneficial to disease progression and outcomes. However, current consensus guideline-recommended pharmacotherapy may not represent an optimal treatment strategy in all heart failure patients. Specifically, individuals with genetic variation in regions central to mediation of beneficial response to standard heart failure agents may not receive optimal benefit from these drugs. Additionally, targeted approaches in phase 3 clinical trials that select patients for inclusion based on the genotype most likely to respond might advance the currently stalled drug development pipeline in heart failure. This article reviews the literature in heart failure pharmacogenetics to date, opportunities for discovery in recent and upcoming clinical trials, as well as future directions in this field.", 
    "205": "Reducing the excessive accumulation of amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a key objective of most AD therapies. Several studies suggest that pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or its by-product angiotensin II may delay onset or progression of dementia and it has been suggested that this occurs via regulation of A\u03b2. Intraneuronal oligomeric accumulation of A\u03b2 is postulated to be one of the earliest pathological events. Thus this study investigated the effect of an ACE-inhibitor, captopril, and two angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), eprosartan and valsartan, on intraneuronal A\u03b2 pathology and oligomeric A\u03b2 levels in a triple transgenic (3xTGAD) mouse model of AD.", 
    "206": "Male, adult (3-4 month old) 3xTgAD mice (n=39) were randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups: valsartan (0.17g/l), eprosartan (0.8g/l), captopril (5g/l) or normal drinking water and the drugs given ad libitum for 2 months. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was measured at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 2 months when the mice were sacrificed and the brains hemisected for analysis. One hemisphere was processed for A\u03b2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemistry and the other for biochemical measurement of oligomeric A\u03b2 and APP. ACE activity was measured in the brain and kidney.", 
    "207": "MABP was significantly reduced at 2 weeks and 2 months in the ACE-I group (p=0.0006) but was unaltered in the ARB groups compared to vehicle. Neither ACE-I nor ARB treatment altered A\u03b2 and APP immunolabelling or the level of A\u03b2 or APP in brain tissue homogenates. Similarly neither ACE-I nor ARB treatment altered ACE activity in either brain or kidney compared to control tissue.", 
    "208": "ACE-I or ARB administration over 2 months did not affect APP levels or either intraneuronal A\u03b2 or oligomeric A\u03b2 levels in 3xTGAD mice. While ARBs did not alter MABP, captopril did mediate reductions in MABP in the 3xTGAD mice which appeared to be independent of ACE activity. Further studies are needed to examine the effects of these drugs over a longer term and in older mice (i.e. when AD-like changes are more pronounced)."
