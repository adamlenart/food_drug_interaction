The elimination of symptoms may be associated either with a complete elimination of arrhythmia or with a conversion of symptomatic atrial fibrillation into asymptomatic episodes of arrhythmia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the occurrence of asymptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 52 patients treated with propafenone (35 drug trials) or propranolol (34 drug trials) by means of ambulatory ECG Holter monitoring. Propafenone was clinically effective (complete relief of symptoms) in 26 (74%) patients. However, in 7 cases (27%) asymptomatic episodes of arrhythmia were still recorded when awake. In patients treated with propranolol clinical symptoms were absent in 18 (53%). However, in 4 (22%) patients attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation were present. The mechanism of drug-induced conversion of symptomatic episodes of atrial fibrillation into asymptomatic spells of arrhythmia was a marked shortening in duration of episodes in 7 patients (from 2215 +/- 3843 s to 16 +/- 10 s, N.S.) or by a significant slowing of ventricular response during atrial fibrillation in 4 patients (from 125 +/- 27 to 84 +/- 8 beats/min, P = 0.05). In conclusion, in a significant proportion of patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation asymptomatic episodes of arrhythmia may occur while on anti-arrhythmic drug therapy. Some of these patients, particularly those with other risk factors for stroke such as advanced age or the presence of organic heart disease, may require anti-coagulant therapy or change in anti-arrhythmic treatment, and can be selected on the basis of ambulatory ECG monitoring.", 
    "1": "Chiral recognition abilities of a recently developed new type of cellulose phenylcarbamates were studied. These chiral stationary phases (CSPs) simultaneously contain both electron-withdrawing (Cl) and electron-donating (CH3) substituents on the phenyl moiety. Chiral pharmaceuticals which belong to the various pharmacological groups (sedatives, hypnotics, anticonvulsants, Ca2+ channel blockers, beta-blockers, antitusives, antihystaminics, choleretics, diuretics, antimycotics, etc) were resolved to enantiomers. These new CSPs sometimes exhibit alternative chiral recognition ability to that most successful commercially available cellulosic CSP Chiralcel-OD and can be used as a good complement to it in analytical and preparative scale enantioseparations.", 
    "2": "An improved high performance liquid chromatographic assay for plasma-unbound atenolol is described. The assay has a wide range (10-5000 ng ml-1) of linearity and a detection limit of 5 ng ml-1 (or 0.1 ng per injection) with acceptable intra- and inter-assay reproducibilities using small volumes of plasma (100 microliters). Following administration of a single dose of atenolol to the rat, nine blood samples were collected over a period of 8 h. These samples were analyzed for atenolol concentrations by a sensitive and specific microbore high performance liquid chromatograph with a photodiode-array detector. This multi-channel detector was used to acquire spectral information on atenolol and demonstrated a superior performance in comparison to all other techniques in that both qualitative and quantitative information were acquired with the system. Because of it sensitivity and applicability to plasma analysis, the assay can be used for pharmacokinetic studies and is valuable in therapeutic drug monitoring.", 
    "3": "The Hemopump is a useful left ventricular assist device. Because it is a rotary blood pump, the pump performance is not constant and is dependent on the cardiac cycle. We measured the static flow delivered by the pump at varying pressure heads (delta P) in a mock circulation. These data are compared to the pump performance in vivo. On the basis of these results, 5 sheep were instrumented for continuous Hemopump flow measurement as well as left ventricular and aortic pressure measurements. The Hemopump flow was relayed instantaneously to the pressure head. Low filling and ventricular failing (through intravenous administration of a beta-blocker) conditions were applied. The in vivo measured flows also are pressure head dependent, but the flow curve shows hysteresis resulting in a loop during each cardiac cycle. The in vivo peak flows (delta P = 0) are similar to the in vitro data. The in vivo means flows (delta = 50 mm Hg) are similar to the in vitro data for the lower pump speeds but are less than that at the higher pump speeds (3.74 +/- 0.55 L/min in vivo at Speed 7 versus 4.6 L/min in vitro). Low filling interrupts the delta P-flow loop and reduces flow. In the failing ventricle, delta P increases and flow is reduced. The cannula leaks and results in aortic insufficiency (0.36 +/- 0.05 L/min) when the pump is turned off. Several conclusions have been drawn from these tests: Cardiac activity is beneficial for the pump performance as well as when the aortic pressure curve is nonpulsatile; the longer the systolic phase, the higher the pump flow; the pump should never be turned off in clinical use, and filling is important for the pump's performance.", 
    "4": "An experimental model to study vomiting due to acute increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) was standardized in dogs. Chronic lateral cerebral ventricle cannulated animals were partially restrained in an observation chamber. The cannula was connected to a buffered saline pressure head which could be adjusted to the required height with the help of a pulley system to attain the desired intracranial pressure. In separate sets of experiments the ICP was raised and maintained at 20, 40, 60 and 80 mmHg for 30 min. The incidence of vomiting and/or retching was observed and the vomiting/retching score (V/R score) was calculated to quantify the severity. The V/R score increased with the level of ICP, maximum being at ICP 80 mmHg. At this level, the effect of pretreatment with propranolol, prazosin and ondansetron was studied. Prazosin and propranolol treatment reduced the vomiting/retching score, while ondansetron failed to do so. This model can be used for evaluating therapeutic interventions for elevated ICP-induced vomiting.", 
    "5": "It has been proposed that beta-blocker therapy reverses metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in acute theophylline poisoning. We present a case of acute theophylline overdose treated with esmolol under haemodynamic control. Haemodynamic monitoring was useful in determining the appropriate duration of administration of esmolol and in deciding on treatment with fluids.", 
    "6": "The influence of academic examinations on immunity and lung function was investigated in 64 adolescents to determine if stress-related changes would differ between healthy and asthmatic students. Blood samples were collected on three occasions: 1 month prior, during, and 2-3 weeks after exams. Leukocyte subsets were enumerated, and in vitro assays were conducted to assess lymphocyte proliferative and cytolytic responses and neutrophil production of superoxides. Examinations elicited significant changes in several lymphocyte subsets and marked alterations in the three functional measures in all students. However, the magnitude and pattern of change did not differ between healthy and asthmatic students. Similarly, neither mild nor more severe asthmatics showed an exam-related decrement in lung function, as reflected by peak expiratory flow rate. This research validated that examinations are a salient cause of altered immune responses, but indicates that there is not a concomitant aggravation of inflammatory disease in well-managed asthmatics.", 
    "7": "This study was designed to compare the effects of nicardipine (0.02 mg/kg) and labetalol (0.5 mg/kg) on the uterine blood flow and fetal circulation after intravenous administration in unanesthetized, chronically instrumented pregnant goats. Significant decreases in maternal blood pressure and uterine blood flow were observed in both groups. The maternal heart rate increased significantly after the injection of nicardipine, whereas this change was not observed after the labetalol injection. The fetal heart rate, blood pressure and acid-base status did not change after the injection of either nicardipine or labetalol. These observations in pregnant goats suggest that both nicardipine and labetalol might be useful drugs for the treatment of acutely hypertensive crises in pregnant patients.", 
    "8": "Fastidious resuscitation is essential in the initial management of acute variceal bleeding and requires adequate monitoring. Where endoscopic services are available diagnostic endoscopy should be performed ideally within 4-6 hours of admission and endoscopic therapy with injection sclerotherapy or binding ligation performed. Treatment to prevent early rebleeding will require further endoscopic treatment and possibly adjuvant vasoconstrictor therapy (somatostatin/octreotide or glypressin). Where endoscopy is unavailable vasoconstrictor therapy and/or balloon tamponade should be started prior to transfer to a centre with endoscopic facilities. Treatment failures should be considered for TIPSS or surgery. Gastric varices are better treated endoscopically with bovine or human thrombin than sclerotherapy. For prevention of rebleeding, variceal obliteration with endoscopic band ligation or prophylactic beta blockade are the two optimal treatments, although candidates may be identified for TIPPS if rebleeding recurs. Only beta blockers have so far been shown to be of value as primary prophylaxis.", 
    "9": "Tilmicosin(TM), a macrolide antibiotic and active ingredient in formulated Micotil 300 (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN, USA), is the active ingredient in a formulated animal product used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in cattle. Owing to the concern of governmental regulatory agencies over the possibility of an accidental injection of the antibiotic to a livestock handler, the cardiovascular effects of sub lethal doses of TM were evaluated in conscious mixed-breed dogs. Left ventricular function, systemic arterial blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) responses to TM alone and in combination with propranolol(P) or dobutamine HCl(DOB) were evaluated. Dogs were instrumented with indwelling micromanometers implanted in the left ventricular chamber and in the thoracic aorta. Cardiovascular variables were recorded, and the peak value of the first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dp/dt(max)) was used as an index of left ventricular inotropic state. Six treatments were randomly assigned to each of the six dogs using a Latin square design. The six treatments were vehicle, TM alone (2.5 mg/kg of body weight), TM immediately followed by P, and TM immediately followed by 1 of 3 dosages of DOB infused for approximately 45 min. Additionally, doses of TM alone (0.25, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg) were administered to complete a dose-response curve. TM caused dose dependent decreases in (dp/dt(max)) and aortic pulse pressure. HR increased dose-dependently. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased at the 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg dosages. Left ventricular systolic pressure was reduced dose-dependently at the 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg dosages. Treatment with P exacerbated the negative inotropic effect and the decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure, but did not attenuate the tachycardia associated with TM treatment. DOB attenuated the changes in ventricular inotropic state in a dose-dependent manner. DOB infusion also restored left ventricular systolic pressure at dosages of 3 or 10 micrograms/min/kg. Our data indicate that toxic doses of TM may have a negative inotropic effect in conscious dogs. HR increased in a dose-dependent manner and was not the result of beta 1-receptor stimulation. DOB reversed some, but not all, of the effects caused by TM administration.", 
    "10": "1. The effect of high and low dose angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and the contribution of bradykinin potentiation in this treatment on left and right ventricle weights and wall volume was investigated in immature spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Male SHR were treated from 7 to 11 weeks of age with perindopril (an ACE inhibitor) at a low dose of 0.1 mg/kg per day or a high dose of 1 mg/kg per day. Half the animals were also treated with a bradykinin receptor antagonist, HOE 140 (500 micrograms/kg per day). 3. After 4 weeks of treatment, hearts were arrested in diastole and perfusion fixed. The right and left ventricle plus septum were weighed, cut into 1 mm slices and volume was determined using the Cavalieri principle. 4. Low dose perindopril treatment did not significantly affect blood pressure in the SHR. High dose perindopril treatment maintained blood pressure at a level similar to Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. 5. Growth of the right ventricle was not influenced by ACE inhibition. However, high dose treatment significantly lowered the left ventricle plus septum volume:bodyweight ratio (LV + S VOL:BWT) compared with control SHR (2.85 +/- 0.02 vs 3.36 +/- 0.08 mm3/g, respectively) to a level similar to the normotensive WKY rats (2.80 +/- 0.11 mm3/g). Similarly, low dose treatment significantly lowered the LV + S VOL:BWT ratio (2.89 +/- 0.09 mm3/g). HOE 140 treatment did not reverse the effect of ACE inhibition. Similar effects were observed on left ventricular weights. 6. ACE inhibition, independent of its blood pressure lowering effect, prevents the development of left ventricular hypertrophy in the SHR but does not influence growth of the right ventricle. This effect of ACE inhibition does not appear to be mediated by bradykinin potentiation.", 
    "11": "1. The effects of antihypertensive drugs on lipids may also influence their effect on coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the clinical significance of these effects and the extent to which they persist during long-term therapy is uncertain. 2. We performed a meta-analysis on 23 randomized trials published between 1988 and 1994 that compared the effects of atenolol, celiprolol (a beta-blocker with beta 2-adrenoceptor intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), enalapril, nifedipine and doxazosin on plasma cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides and blood pressure (BP). 3. Predicted changes in CAD risk were calculated by incorporating the results for these parameters into the Framingham equations. 4. While there were no differences in antihypertensive efficacy between the drugs, atenolol significantly (P < 0.05) reduced HDL-C and increased total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides compared with celiprolol, enalapril, doxazosin and nifedipine. 5. The magnitude of the effects on lipids was not significantly influenced by the duration of therapy (up to 3 years for atenolol and doxazosin and up to 2 years for celiprolol). 6. The improvement in Framingham equation point scores (systolic BP formula) was significantly (P < 0.05) less for atenolol (-0.54; confidence intervals (CI) -0.29-(-0.78)) than for celiprolol (-1.69; CI -0.68-2.70), doxazosin (-1.67; CI -1.11-(-2.23)), enalapril (-1.43; CI 0.23-(-3.07)) and nifedipine (-1.91; CI -1.22-(-2.59)). Similar results were obtained for the Framingham diastolic BP formula. 7. These results suggest that the adverse effects of atenolol ]on plasma lipids do not improve with prolonged therapy and are theoretically great enough to reduce its efficacy in reducing CAD by approximately two thirds compared with antihypertensive drugs that do not adversely affect plasma lipids. However it must be emphasized that these are theoretical effects. In order to determine the actual differences between these drugs on CAD end points, studies using these end points are required.", 
    "12": "1. Specific [125I]-angiotensin II (AngII) binding in normal and hypertrophied human myocardial membranes was saturable and of high affinity. Low concentrations of unlabelled AngII and saralasin competed with [125I]-AngII for the binding sites in these tissues. Thus, saturable [125I]-AngII binding in human myocardium exhibited pharmacological specificity that characterized high affinity receptors for AngII. 2. There was little difference in the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) values for [125I]-AngII binding between normal and hypertrophied human myocardium, whereas the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) was significantly (51%) lower in the hypertrophied group. Further, PD123177, a selective antagonist of the AT2 receptor subtype, showed three orders of magnitude higher affinity for [125I]-AngII binding sites in both normal and hypertrophied myocardium than losartan, a selective antagonist of the AT1 receptor subtype; the Hill coefficients for these drugs were close to one. 3. A significant decrease in Bmax and Kd values for (-)-[125I]-iodocyanopindolol binding between normal and hypertrophied human myocardium rarely occurred. 4. The present study suggests that both normal and hypertrophied human myocardium predominantly contains the AT2 receptor subtype and that these receptors are down-regulated in hypertrophied tissues.", 
    "13": "1. We have evaluated the possibility that alterations in lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor density may be related to changes in the myocardial population in left heart valvular diseases. Receptor density and their binding affinities were estimated using [125I]-iodocyanopindolol. 2. The lymphocyte (LC) beta-adrenoceptor density was 43.4 +/- 5.6 fmol/mg protein in the controls (n = 35) and 81% lower in heart valvular patients (n = 86). In myocardial controls (n = 18), the left ventricular (LV) receptor density was 167.2 +/- 29.8 fmol/mg protein, right ventricular (RV) density was 123.1 +/- 14.6 fmol/mg, left atrial (LA) density was 81.6 +/- 10.5 fmol/mg and right atrial (RA) 108.1 +/- 14.5 fmol/mg. Compared with this group, the receptor density of the study patients (n = 47) decreased by 67, 43, 24 and 32% in the LV, RV, LA and RA, respectively. The decrease in LC was twice that of the average total myocardial receptor density. 3. When patients were classified according to their left ventricular load conditions as having either left ventricular pressure overload (LVP), left ventricular volume overload, mixed lesions (MOL) and no left ventricular overload (mitral stenosis; NOL), the attenuation in LC receptor density reached statistical significance for all four groups, without showing significant difference between the individual groups. In contrast, the decrease in all chambers was predominantly due to volume overload. MOL and NOL exerted intermediate effects that were significant in the LV, while LVP did not contribute to the changes in the LA. 4. Accordingly, the reduction in peripheral beta-adrenoceptor density may reflect the extent to which particularly the volume overload exerts its influence on myocardial beta-adrenoceptors in left heart valvular patients.",

    "15": "GLP-1 administration decreases blood glucose levels in normal subjects and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients and is therefore proposed as a treatment for diabetic hyperglycaemia. The glucose lowering effect of GLP-1 is glucose dependent and therefore self-limiting, but it is not known to which extent counterregulatory mechanisms participate in this. GLP-1 was infused i.v. into 8 healthy subjects after an overnight fast at a rate of 100 pmol kg-1 h-1 for 1 h with and without beta-adrenoceptor blockade (i.v. bolus of 5 mg propranolol followed by a continuous infusion of 0.08 mg min-1). In a control experiment, saline and propranolol were infused. Hepatic glucose production was measured and blood was analysed for plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, catecholamines, and radioactivity. Plasma GLP-1 levels were similar on the two GLP-1 infusion days and resulted in: (1) a significant decrease in plasma glucose from 5.2 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 +/- 0.1 mmol l-1 with GLP-1/propranolol infusion, and from 5.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.0 +/- 0.1 mmol l-1 with GLP-1/saline infusion (NS); (2) a corresponding significant increase in plasma insulin from 58.0 +/- 6.3 to 144.5 +/- 22.3 pmol l-1 and from 61.7 +/- 6.4 to 148.2 +/- 34.0 pmol l-1, respectively (NS); (3) a significant decrease in plasma glucagon from 11.7 +/- 1.6 to 6.5 +/- 1.5 pmol l-1 and from 10.4 +/- 1.6 to 4.6 +/- 1.0 pmol l-1, respectively; (4) a significant decrease in the rate of glucose appearance which was not significantly different on the two GLP-1 infusion days; and (5) an increase in catecholamine levels in the GLP-1/saline experiment and also in the beta-blockade experiments. We conclude that adrenergic counterregulation plays an insignificant role in curtailing GLP-1's glucose lowering effect.", 
    "16": "1. The possible existence of a beta 3-adrenoceptor in human brown and white adipose tissues was investigated by mRNA expression and binding studies. 2. The relative amounts of beta 1-, beta 2- and beta 3-adrenoceptor mRNA, as determined by total RNA Northern blot analysis in newborn brown adipose tissue, were 28, 63 and 9% respectively of the total beta-adrenoceptor mRNA. 3. The beta 1/beta 2-adrenoceptors of human brown adipose tissue plasma membranes were characterized using [3H]-CGP 12177 as a ligand. Their Kd and Bmax values were 1.9 nM and 156 fmol mg-1 of membrane proteins, respectively. The beta 3-adrenoceptor was characterized by use of the new specific radioligand [3H]-SB 206606. The binding of this ligand was stereospecifically displaced by the active R,R- or the inactive S,S-enantiomer of BRL 37344 up to a concentration of about 10 microM. The Kd and Bmax values of the brown adipose tissue membrane beta 3-adrenoceptors were 87 nM and 167 fmol mg-1 of proteins, respectively. A low affinity [3H]-CGP 12177 binding site population was also detected in these membranes. 4. In human omental white adipose tissue, no beta 3-adrenoceptor mRNA could be detected in total RNA Northern blots and the beta 1-and beta 2-adrenoceptor mRNAs represented 9 and 91%, respectively of the total beta-adrenoceptor mRNA, and no specific binding of [3H]-SB 206606 could be measured.", 
    "17": "1. The effects of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists including (-)- and (+)-propranolol, (-)- and (+)-penbutolol, timolol, pindolol, atenolol, acebutolol and practolol on the Ca(2+)-overload induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) were examined in isolated cardiomyocytes of the rat. 2. Fura-2 was used for measurement of the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). LPC (15 microM) produced a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i from 72 +/- 5 to 3042 +/- 431 nM which coincided with a decrease in the percentage of rod-shaped cells from 69 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 2%. 3. Preincubation with (-)-propranolol (20 microM), (+)-propranolol (50 microM), or (-)- or (+)-penbutolol (20 microM), the lipophilicity of which is higher than other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, significantly inhibited both the increase in [Ca2+]i and the cell-shape change induced by 15 microM LPC. The inhibitory effects of the four drugs on the LPC-induced increase in [Ca2+]i and cell-shape change were concentration-dependent. The IC50S of (-)-propranolol, (+)-propranolol, (-)- and (+)-penbutolol for the increase in [Ca2+]i were 1.28, 10.50, 0.67 and 0.76 microM, respectively. 4. Pretreatment with pindolol, timolol, acebutolol, practolol, atenolol or lignocaine did not inhibit the increase in [Ca2+]i and the morphological change induced by LPC. 5. LPC markedly increased the release of creatine phosphokinase from 9 +/- 1 to 45 +/- 2% which could be significantly reduced by (-)- or (+)-propranolol but not by acebutolol or timolol. 6. The protective effects of (-)- and (+)-propranolol, (-)- and (+)-penbutolol against the Ca(2+)-overload induced by LPC were not associated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic action, but probably with an unknown action which is related to the preservation of membrane integrity. Further studies are necessary to clarify the exact mechanisms of the protective action of these beta-adrenoceptor antagonists against the Ca(2+)-overload induced by LPC.", 
    "18": "In the present study we evaluated the relationship between the cumulative amount of propranolol permeating through the stratum corneum and the formation of erythema, a skin irritation reaction, after transdermal application of adhesive patches containing propranolol to the skin of guinea pigs. The intensity of erythema was expressed in terms of a* values measured with a chromameter. The a* values increased in guinea pigs after application of the adhesive patches containing 0.4 mg/cm2 of propranolol to the skin. Since the adhesive patches showed good adhesion to the skin (propranolol content is less than the saturated concentration in the adhesive base) and the cumulative amount of propranolol permeating through the stratum corneum is small, the development of erythema was considered to be mainly due to physical factors such as peeling. Even in adhesive patches containing 0.8 mg/cm2 or 1.2 mg/cm2 of propranolol, a* values increased, although adhesion to the skin is low because of crystallization of propranolol in the adhesive base. On the other hand, in these two adhesive patches, the cumulative amount of propranolol permeating through the stratum corneum increased up to 24 h after application. These findings suggest that the skin irritation reaction is due to propranolol mainly absorbed transdermally, because there is a high correlation between the cumulative amount of propranolol permeating through the stratum corneum and the a* values (r = 0.928).", 
    "19": "Some controlled clinical trials showed a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on symptoms, exercise tolerance, and left ventricular function in dilated cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to investigate if there are clinical variables at baseline that could predict a favorable response to long-term metoprolol therapy.", 
    "20": "Since November 1987, 94 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40 were treated with metoprolol (mean final dosage, 136 +/- 32 mg) associated with tailored medical therapy with digitalis, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Eighty-four surviving patients had a complete 2-year noninvasive follow-up period. Ten patients died or were transplanted before the final assessment. Improvement was defined according to a clinical score based on left ventricular ejection fraction (increase > or = 10 U), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (decrease > or = 10%), regression of restrictive filling pattern, New York Heart Association functional class, exercise tolerance (increase > or = 2 minutes), and cardiothoracic ratio (decrease > or = 10%). According to these criteria, 48 patients (51.1%) were classified as improved. Multivariate analysis identified a group of patients with a history of mild hypertension (blood pressure between 140/90 and 170/100 mmHg) and significantly higher probability of improvement with longterm metoprolol (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-3.94; P = .007). Among the 71 patients with normal blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg), heart rate in upright position (100 vs 75 beats/min: OR, 2; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-4.94; P = .003), left ventricular ejection fraction 0.20-0.33 versus less than 0.20 (OR, 4.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-21.04; P = .042), and New York Heart Association class I-II versus III-IV (OR, 2.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-7.75; P = .05) were significantly associated with a positive response to metoprolol. At baseline, both supine and upright heart rate were significantly higher in patients who improved, but heart rate in the upright position was the most significant predictor of improvement in patients with normal blood pressure at multivariate analysis.",

    "22": "Congestive heart failure is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Modification of neurohormonal activation by use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been shown to decrease symptoms and prolong survival. More recent evidence has suggested that beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent therapy may be also beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure, possibly by down-regulating the activation of the adrenergic system. A large number of randomized trials of beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents in heart failure have been performed. These studies demonstrated improvement in symptoms of congestive heart failure, functional classification, and reduction in the number of patients requiring cardiac transplantation. beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents have not been shown to decrease mortality, however, the current trials have been too small to be conclusive in this regard.",

    "27": "Aprikalim is a potent, specific, and selective opener of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. By virtue of this pharmacological property, aprikalim affords cardioprotection in experimental models of ischemia/reperfusion injury, and, at higher doses, also causes peripheral or coronary vasodilatation. Direct-acting peripheral vasodilators can cause myocardial lesions, particularly in rats and dogs. However, unexpectedly, aprikalim produced this effect also in monkeys. Thus, the primary aim of this investigation was to assess whether in monkeys these myocardial lesions were the direct or indirect consequence of the vascular effects of aprikalim. Cynomologus monkeys were given the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol (2 mg/kg p.o., twice daily) for 4 consecutive days. On the third and fourth day of the experiment, they received aprikalim (1 mg/kg p.o.). In another series, two monkeys carrying telemetry transmitters for blood pressure and heart rate measurements were also given aprikalim or its vehicle. Finally, aprikalim (1 mg/kg p.o. for 2 days) or its vehicle was administered to rats which were concurrently treated with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol (5 mg/kg s.c.) or its vehicle. In cynomologus monkeys, aprikalim produced focal and multifocal myocardial necrosis of minimal to moderate intensity in or near the papillary muscles of the left ventricle. These effects were abrogated by nadolol. Similarly, necrotic lesions were caused by aprikalim only in those rats which had not been pretreated with atenolol. In monkeys, aprikalim produced a marked and long-lasting decrease in aortic blood pressure, accompanied by an even more prolonged tachycardia. These results demonstrate that aprikalim can produce myocardial necrosis not only in rats but also in monkeys. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such adverse effects are reported for a vasodilator in monkeys. More importantly, these effects were prevented by blocking cardiac beta-adrenoceptors.

    "28": "Using beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists this study investigated the importance of three different adrenoceptor subtypes for the regulation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMCs) of the upper small intestine in conscious, naive rats. After a control period of 60 min with four activity fronts, agonists were given as an intravenous infusion for another 60 min. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (1 microgram kg-1 min-1) inhibited MMCs and induced irregular spiking during the infusion period. This effect was blocked by intravenous administration of a bolus dose of either the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (1 mg kg-1), or the beta 2-antagonist ICI 118 551 (1 mg kg-1), both given prior to isoprenaline. However, acebutolol (1 mg kg-1), a selective beta 1-antagonist, failed to antagonize the effect of isoprenaline. Furthermore, prenalterol, a selective beta 1-agonist (12.5-800.0 micrograms kg-1 min-1), had no effect on the MMC pattern, whereas the beta 2-selective agonist ritodrine (25-100 micrograms kg-1 min-1) induced a myoelectric pattern similar to one induced by isoprenaline. The partial beta 3-adrenoceptor agonist D7114 (50-100 micrograms kg-1 min-1), disrupted the MMCs and induced quiescence. Neither of the antagonists, i.e. propranolol (1 mg kg-1), acebutolol (1 mg kg-1) nor ICI 118 551 (1 mg kg-1), given alone induced changes in the MMC pattern. In conclusion, beta 2-adrenoceptors in particular but also beta 3-adrenoceptors seem to be of importance in the regulation of small intestinal motility by disrupting the regular MMC pattern in rats.",

Participants included a random sample of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years or older. Blacks were oversampled. A health questionnaire was administered, and blood pressure was measured. Of 5,223 eligible persons, 4,162 (80%) participated. Fifty-four percent of subjects were black and 65% were women. Sixteen percent of the study subjects were white men, 30% white women, 19% black men, and 35% black women. The mean age was 73 years. Fifty-three percent had hypertension. Among hypertensives, 80.8% were taking blood pressure medication. Among treated hypertensives, blood pressure was adequately controlled, (measured diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or lower) in 85.6%. Women were 52% more likely than men and blacks were 40% less likely than whites to exhibit adequate blood pressure control. Older age and smoking were also associated with better blood pressure control. The authors conclude that hypertension is more likely to be controlled in elderly women than men and less likely to be well-controlled in elderly blacks than whites. The choice of antihypertensive agent may also be important. Further investigation is needed into the mechanisms accounting for the observed sex and race differences.",

    "40": "We determined the relationship between the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes in isolated myocytes and their physiological responsiveness in chronically instrumented conscious baboons and rats. In conscious baboons, isoproterenol (ISO) (0.02 microgram/kg) increased left ventricular (LV) dP/dt by 89 +/- 6.7% from 2898 +/- 370 mmHg/s and only by 13 +/- 3.3% from 2491 +/- 146 mmHg/s after beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade, indicating that the predominant physiological response was mediated by beta 1-adrenergic receptors. Decreases in mean arterial pressure (-11 +/- 0.5 mmHg v -16 +/- 4.6 mmHg) and coronary vascular resistance (-3.1 +/- 0.4 v -3.6 +/- 0.4 mmHg/ml/min) induced by ISO were not different before and after beta 1-blockade, indicating that beta 2-adrenergic receptors were not blocked. In conscious rats, ISO (0.4 microgram/kg) increased LV dP/dt by 50 +/- 4.9% from 13252 +/- 2002 mmHg/s and only by 10 +/- 3.9% from 10793 +/- 1364 mmHg/s after beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockade: whereas decreases in mean arterial pressure induced by ISO were not different before and after beta 1-blockade (-19 +/- 2.4 mmHg v -16 +/- 2.2 mmHg), i.e. very consistent with the physiological responses in baboons. In vitro studies of isolated myocytes, using radioligand binding with 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-cyp) and the subtype beta 1-selective antagonist betaxolol and the beta 2-selective antagonist ICI 118551 indicated that the beta 1/beta 2 ratio of rat myocytes was 92/8: whereas baboon myocytes were more equally distributed (59/41). Thus, in both species the preponderance of effects of ISO on ventricular function was beta 1-adrenergic receptor mediated, which is consistent with the beta 1/beta 2 ratio in rat myocytes but not in baboon myocytes, where a significant fraction of beta 2-adrenergic receptors does not appear to exert an effect on conctractility in vivo.", 
    "41": "It has been reported that the frequency of premature ventricular contractions in some patients tend to decrease during the hours of sleep when modifications in autonomic tone and bradycardia occur. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the phenomenon of sleep suppression may be a sensitive and specific parameter for predicting the antiarrhythmic effect of beta-blockers on premature ventricular contractions. The presence of sleep suppression was evaluated in 45 patients (mean age 50 +/- 17 years) with frequent premature ventricular contractions at two baseline Holter recordings. Sleep suppression was defined as > 50% reduction in the number of nighttime as opposed to day-time premature ventricular contractions. Three groups of patients were identified: those with sleep suppression at both Holter recordings (group 1); those with sleep suppression at only one Holter recording (group 2); and those without sleep suppression at either Holter recording (group 3). A third Holter was performed 5 days after nadolol administration. In group 1, nadolol led to a mean reduction in the number of premature ventricular contractions of 90% (> 70% in 21/23 patients). In group 2, the mean reduction was 76% (> 70% in three out of six patients). In group 3, there was a mean increase in the number of premature ventricular contractions of 33%. The positive predictive accuracy of sleep suppression in relation to the antiarrhythmic efficacy of nadolol is very high (88%) when sleep suppression is present during two baseline Holter recordings. Sleep suppression is a sensitive parameter for identifying the premature ventricular contractions likely to benefit from beta-blocker administration.", 
    "42": "A growing body of data support the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the prevention of cardiac enlargement and improvement of left ventricular function in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, very little information exists about the direct effect of increased afterload on cardiac performance in these patients and the possible favourable effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates. We have, therefore, studied the effects of captopril as adjuvant therapy to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates (standard therapy) on left ventricular performance in 77 consecutive patients with uncomplicated Q-wave acute myocardial infarction, by the measurement of the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio before and after (0.25-0.50 mg) phenylephrine administration on the 4th and 30th post-infarction days. Patients were randomized on day 4 either to continue standard therapy alone (group 1, 35 patients) or to receive oral captopril therapy (12.5 mg t.i.d.) in addition to standard therapy (group 2, 42 patients) in a double-blind parallel study. Among the patients of group 1 there was a significant deterioration of left ventricular function after phenylephrine administration. This was shown by an increase of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio only in the subset of patients with ejection fraction < 40%, as measured by contrast ventriculography, on both the 4th and 30th post-infarction days changing from 0.435 +/- 0.070 to 0.528 +/- 0.101, P < 0.01 and from 0.404 +/- 0.098 to 0.515 +/- 0.092, P < 0.02, respectively. In contrast there were no significant changes in patients with ejection fraction > or = 40%. Among patients of group 2, phenylephrine administration induced a significant increase, only on the 4th day, in pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio only in the subset of patients with ejection fraction < 40% changing from 0.410 +/- 0.107 to 0.535 +/- 0.102, P < 0.01. In the remaining patients with ejection fraction > or = 40% there were no significant changes on either the 4th or 30th post-infarction days. Furthermore, a significant improvement was observed after phenylephrine administration in the pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio between the 4th and 30th post-infarction days, which changed from 0.535 +/- 0.102 on day 4 to 0.368 +/- 0.052 on day 30 (P < 0.004). Also, a four-way ANOVA detected a significant reduction of heart rate in patients with ejection fraction < 40% from day 4 to day 30. The results indicate that: (1) the response of pre-ejection period/left ventricular ejection time ratio after increasing afterload may be a useful non-invasive method for the detection of left ventricular dysfunction in myocardial infarction patients; and (2) captopril adjuvant therapy as compared to thrombolysis, beta-blockers and nitrates alone, after phenylephrine administration, improves the left ventricular performance response in asymptomatic Q-wave post-infarction patients and beneficially affects heart rate. This effect is most pronounced in patients with ejection fraction < 40% whereas those with ejection fraction > or = 40% do not obtain clear benefit.",

Carazolol was injected to enhance the placental dropping and also as a prophylactic measure to minimize the incidence of retained foetal membrane in the she-camel. Normal dropping of placenta engaged 49.27 +/- 6.76 minutes. In the treated animals the time needed for normal placental dropping was 33.00 +/- 10.05 minutes when injected with a prophylactic dose of carazolol.

    "45": "The opening of ATP-sensitive K+ (K+ATP) channels contributes to the mechanism of metabolic coronary vasodilation. The aim of the present study was to determine whether K+ATP channel opener pinacidil augments coronary vasodilation induced by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. In anesthetized dogs, coronary vasodilation in response to intracoronary infusion of a beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist denopamine, selective beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoproterenol after bisoprolol or nitroglycerin was studied before and during simultaneous intracoronary infusion of pinacidil at a dose of 1 microgram/min, which had no effect on basal hemodynamics. Pinacidil augmented the denopamine-induced increase in coronary blood flow (CBF) from 38 +/- 9 to 66 +/- 16% (P < 0.05) but did not affect the denopamine-induced by isoproterenol or nitroglycerin. Thus pinacidil selectively augmented beta 1-adrenoceptor-mediated coronary vasodilation. These observations suggest that the K+ATP channel opener pinacidil may increase myocardial perfusion during metabolic stress associated with beta 1-adrenoceptor stimulation.", 
    "46": "An acute and direct effect of epinephrine (Epi) on muscle proteolysis was investigated using a single-pass mode of rat hindquarter perfusion. The rate of tyrosine (Tyr) release at > 30 min with cycloheximide was regarded as the muscle proteolytic rate. Infusion of Epi (500 nM) to the hindquarters of fed rats led to a sharp decrease in the Tyr release to 50% within 5 min, accompanied by an increase in perfusion pressure and edema around the perfused tissues. To clarify the mechanism, alpha- and beta-antagonists were used together with Epi. A mixture of 10 microM prazosin and 10 microM yohimbine (alpha-adrenergic blockade) before or after Epi infusion completely prevented the edema development and resulted in a new steady state to 80% of the initial rate. On the contrary, 100 microM propranolol (a beta-antagonist) with Epi did not abolish the edema and caused fluctuation in Tyr release. Whether the above results are affected by changes in Tyr transport at the plasma membrane was tested by measuring Tyr efflux from the perfused muscle. Only a beta-adrenergic blockade significantly reduced the rate constant of Tyr efflux from the intracellular pool by 13%. These results suggested that the suppression of Tyr release by alpha-adrenergic activity was mainly due to the effect on Tyr efflux, whereas that by beta-adrenergic activity was not at the Tyr transport level but at the proteolysis level, demonstrating that Epi directly inhibits proteolysis of skeletal muscle via the beta-adrenoceptor.", 
    "47": "Unilateral microinjection of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) into the posterior hypothalamic nucleus (PHN) of conscious rats evoked a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP). The pressor response was accompanied by tachycardia at all doses of CCh used (0.8-13.2 nmol), although the tachycardia was followed by a secondary bradycardia after the two highest doses (5.5 and 13.2 nmol). To determine the involvement of the autonomic nervous system and arginine vasopressin (AVP) in these cardiovascular changes, we administered selective receptor antagonists intravenously (i.v.) before microinjection of CCh into the PHN. The pressor response evoked by 3.3 nmol CCh could be attenuated by prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenoceptor blocker) or yohimbine (an alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker) and completely blocked by the combination of prazosin and yohimbine. In contrast, the increase in MAP evoked by 5.5 and 13.2 nmol CCh could be attenuated by prazosin, yohimbine, or D[(CH2)5Tyr(Me)]AVP (AVPX, a V 1-vasopressin receptor blocker), and completely blocked by the combination of prazosin and AVPX. The tachycardia evoked by the 3.3-, 5.5-, and 13.2-nmol doses of CCh could be attenuated by propranolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker), and the secondary bradycardia evoked by 5.5 and 13.2 nmol CCh could be attenuated by either methylatropine (a muscarinic receptor blocker) or AVPX. These results suggest that administration of CCh into the PHN increases sympathetic nervous system activity, which increases MAP and heart rate (HR). The increase in MAP activates a baroreflex-mediated bradycardia by increasing vagal tone. This bradycardia is potentiated by an increase in circulating levels of AVP, which also contributes to the increased blood pressure (BP).",

    "53": "In 9 isolated rabbit heart, 7 monophasic action potentials (MAPs) and an ECG were recorded simultaneously. Vulnerable periods were determined using two different shock strengths, one close to the fibrillation threshold and the other close to the upper limit of vulnerability, at baseline and after action potential prolongation by d-sotalol.", 
    "54": "The vulnerable period had a duration of 30 +/- 14 ms for the lower and 34 +/- 12 ms for the higher shock strength (P = NS). Coupling intervals of the vulnerable periods were 13 +/- 10 ms shorter for higher shock strengths as compared to lower shock strengths (P < 0.005). The vulnerable period for low shock strengths coincided with dispersion of MAPs at 90% repolarisation (r = 0.87-0.92, P < 0.005), and the vulnerable period for high shock strengths coincided with dispersion at 70% repolarisation (r = 0.82-0.93, P < 0.005). ECG parameters predicted the vulnerable periods less precisely than MAP repolarisation (r < or = 0.72). d-Sotalol prolonged MAP durations by an average of 33 ms at 70% and 39 ms at 90% repolarisation but did not alter the described relations, nor did it reduce dispersion of repolarisation or duration of the vulnerable periods.", 
    "55": "Dispersion of repolarisation determines vulnerable periods and might be part of the arrhythmogenic substrate promoting induction of VF by T-wave shocks. The coupling intervals of the vulnerable periods depend on the applied shock strength as well as repolarisation, with shock strengths close to the fibrillation threshold inducing VF during dispersion at 90% repolarisation and shock strengths close to the upper limit of vulnerability inducing VF during dispersion at 70% repolarisation. d-Sotalol reduces neither vulnerability to T-wave shocks nor dispersion of repolarisation in this isolated heart model.", 
    "56": "Heart failure is a physiopathological condition, with an increasing incidence and prevalence, involving the action of a series of mechanisms known as \"compensators\", which are phylogenetically ready to normalize minute volume and blood pressure. These mechanisms include the activation of a series of neurohormonal systems: the sympathetic nervous system, the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin arginine, endothelin, which are basically vasoconstrictors, with the counterpoint of other vasodilator systems, such as the endothelial relaxation factor, certain prostaglandins and the bradykinin-kallikrein system, which modulate global response. The authors review the physiopathology of each of these system, as well as their significance in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of heart failure. We analyze the possible deleterious effects of neurohormonal activation, anatomically and at cardiovascular function level, and try to determine if they are capable of explaining the evolution and progression of heart failure, in a truly vicious circle, up until the irreversible heart failure phase. We review the current importance of the inhibition of the aldosterone renin-angiotensin system in the prophylaxis and treatment of heart failure. Furthermore, we describe the present-day value of the inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system in some forms of heart failure. We also analyze the different pharmacological treatments for heart failure: diuretics, inotropic agents, vasodilators (in their different pharmacological types), paying particular attention to their action on neurohormonal systems and their implications in the prognosis and evolution of heart failure.",

The ages ranged from 51 to 68 years. There was one patient with low ejection fraction (EF = 31%) and two patients with porcelain aorta. A tepid temperature was maintained during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). A high flow rate of 2.2-2.6 liter/min/m2 was applied to control perfusion pressure above 50 mmHg during CPB. After CPB was started, a high dose of esomolol was added (10-30 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 1-4 mg/kg/min). Severe bradycardia was achieved by the initial loading of esmolol. The mean heart rate was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased from 78 +/- 12 bpm to 49 +/- 7 bpm by the loading. Altogether, 25 anastomoses (11 ITA, 6 GEA, 8 SVG) were performed to LAD (10), Cx (7) and RCA (8), with an average of 3.6 +/- 0.9 anastomoses/patient. IABP was required for 2 patients postoperatively. There was no operative death, but one hospital death due to aspiration pneumonia 3 months later. Postoperative max CPK-MB was low (17.4 +/- 9.7 IU/L) in 6 patients. The postoperative angiography was performed in all patients with a patency rate of 88%. It was considered that esmolol facilitated CABG under beating heart and this technique is suitable for patients with severe atheromatous disease of the ascending aorta or patients with a low ejection fraction to avoid aortic cross-clamping.",

The M cell is distinguished electrophysiologically by the ability of its action potential to prolong disproportionately to that of other myocardial cells with slowing of the stimulation rate and pharmacologically by its unique sensitivity to Class III antiarrhythmic agents. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that similar cells are present in the guinea pig ventricle.", 
    "59": "We used a dermatome to obtain-thin strips of left ventricular free wall from the hearts of guinea pigs (8 to 14 weeks old) and standard microelectrode techniques to record transmembrane activity. Action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (APD90) was significantly longer in mid-myocardial (MID) cells than in surface EPI or ENDO cells at all basic cycle lengths (BCLs) tested. At a BCL of 300 msec, APD90 was 102 +/- 21,136 +/- 9, and 95 +/- 15 msec in EPI, MID, and ENDO cells (mean +/- SD; n = 12). At a BCL of 5000 msec, APD90 was 133 +/- 14, 185 +/- 24, and 135 +/- 13 msec in EPI, MID, and ENDO cells ([K+]o = 4 mM). Thus, APD-rate relations were more pronounced in the MID cells. MID cells were also more sensitive to agents with Class III actions (e.g., d,I-sotalol: 10 to 100 microM), exhibiting a greater APD prolongation than EPI or ENDO. d,I-Sotalol also induced early afterdepolarizations in MID cells but not in EPI or ENDO cells. The rate of rise of the action potential upstroke (Vmax) was significantly greater in MID cells: 129 +/- 13, 240 +/- 42, and 192 +/- 28 V/sec in EPI, MID, and ENDO cells (n = 10 to 18).",

    "61": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors and beta-adrenergic receptors were investigated in rat Harderian gland membranes using 125I-VIP and 125I-cyanopindolol (125I-CYP), respectively, as ligands. The receptor bindings were rapid, reversible, saturable, specific, and dependent on time, temperature, and membrane concentration. The stoichiometric data suggested the presence of two classes of VIP receptors with Kd values of 0.36 and 65.37 nM and binding capacities of 323 and 39,537 fmol VIP/mg protein, respectively. The interaction showed a high degree of specificity, as suggested by competitive displacement experiments with several peptides structurally or not structurally related to VIP as follows: VIP > helodermin > rGRF > PHI > > secretin. Glucagon, somatostatin, insulin, and pancreastatin were ineffective at concentrations up to 1 microM. However, the stoichiometric data suggest the presence of one class of binding sites for 125I-CYP. The Kd for the single site was 290 pM with a binding capacity of 32 pmol/L. The pharmacological characterization of 125I-CYP binding to membranes showed that only isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, and norepinephrine, an alpha beta-adrenergic agonist, was as effective as propranolol in inhibiting 125I-CYP binding to Harderian gland membranes. However, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic agonists and blockers such as methoxamine, prazosin, clonidine, and yohimbine were shown to be ineffective. These results demonstrate the presence of specific VIP and beta-adrenergic receptors in the Harderian gland and suggest a role for VIP and beta-adrenergic agonists in the physiology of this gland.", 
    "62": "Cytochrome P-450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important human drug-metabolizing enzyme responsible for the oxidation of more than 30 widely used therapeutic agents. The enzymes encoded by the published genomic [Kimura, Umeno, Skoda, Meyer and Gonzalez (1989) Am. J. Hum.

The influence of this amino acid difference on cytochrome P-450 expression, ligand binding, catalysis and stereoselective oxidation of metoprolol was investigated by the heterologous expression of the corresponding cDNAs in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The level of expression of apo- and holo-protein was similar with each form of CYP2D6 cDNA, and the binding affinities of a series of ligands to CYP2D6-Val and CYP2D6-Met were identical. The enantioselective O-demethylation and alpha-hydroxylation of metoprolol were also similar with each form of CYP2D6, O-demethylation being R-(+)- enantioselective (CYP2D6-Val: R/S, 1.6; CYP2D6-Met: R/S, 1.4), whereas alpha-hydroxylation showed a preference for S-(-)-metoprolol (CYP2D6-Val: R/S, 0.7; CYP2D6-Met: R/S, 0.8). However, although the favoured regiomer overall was O-demethylmetoprolol (ODM), the regioselectivity for O-demethylation of each metoprolol enantiomer was significantly greater for CYP2D6-Val [R-(+)-: ODM/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol (alpha OH), 5.9; S-(-)-: ODM/alpha OH, 2.5) than that observed for CYP2D6-Met [R-(+)-: ODM/alpha OH, 2.2; S-(-)-: ODM/alpha OH, 1.4]. The stereoselective properties of CYP2D6-Val were consistent with those observed for CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes. The difference in the stereoselective properties of CYP2D6-Val and CYP2D6-Met were rationalized with respect to a homology model of the active site of CYP2D6 based on an alignment with the crystal structure of the bacterial cytochrome P-450BM-3' CYP102.", 
    "63": "The regulation of the intracelluar pH (pHi) during spreading of human neutrophils was studied by a combination of fluorescence imaging and video microscopy. Spreading on adhesive substrates caused a rapid and sustained cytosolic alkalinization. This pHi increase was prevented by the omission of external Na+, suggesting that it results from the activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Spreading-induced alkalinization was also precluded by the compound HOE 694 at concentrations that selectively block the NHE-1 isoform of the Na+H+ antiporter. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange by either procedure unmasked a sizable cytosolic acidification upon spreading, indicative of intracellular acid production. The excess acid generation was caused, at least in part, by the activation of the respiratory burst, since the acidification closely correlated with superoxide production, measured in single spreading neutrophils with dihydrorhodamine-123, and little acid production was observed in the presence of diphenylene iodonium, a blocker of the NADPH oxidase. Moreover, neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients, which do not produce superoxide, failed to acidify. Comparable pHi changes were observed when beta 2 integrins were selectively activated during spreading on surfaces coated with anti-CD18 antibodies. When integrin engagement was precluded by pretreatment with soluble anti-CD18 antibody, the pHi changes associated with spreading on fibrinogen were markedly reduced. Inhibition of microfilament assembly with cytochalasin D precluded spreading and concomitantly abolished superoxide production and the associated pHi changes, indicating that cytoskeletal reorganization and/or an increase in the number of adherence receptors engaged are required for the responses. Neutrophils spread normally when the oxidase was blocked or when pHi was clamped near physiological values with nigericin. Spreading, however, was strongly inhibited when pHi was clamped at acidic values. Our results indicate that neutrophils release superoxide upon spreading, generating a burst of intracellular acid production. The concomitant activation of the Na+/H+ antiport not only prevents the deleterious effects of the acid released by the NADPH oxidase, but induces a net cytosolic alkalinization. Since several functions of neutrophils are inhibited at an acidic pHi, the coordinated activation of pHi regulatory mechanisms along with the oxidase is essential for sustained microbicidal activity.",

    "71": "The interactions between beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) antagonists and the beta(2)AR were studied with the use of photoaffinity labels. A proteolytic map of the receptor was made and confirmed through amino-terminal amino acid sequencing by locating sites of derivatization. [125I]Iodoazidothiophenylalprenolol (IAPTA) is a photoaffinity derivative of the beta AR antagonist alprenolol with a photoactivatable group on the aryloxy end of the molecule. IAPTA exclusively derivatizes a peptide consisting of transmembrane domains (TMs) 6 and 7 of the hamster lung beta(2)AR, supporting the contention that TMs 6 and 7 interact with the aryloxy portion of the beta AR antagonist pharmacophore. The beta AR antagonist photoaffinity labels [125I]iodoazidobenzylpindolol (IABP), [125I]iodoazidophenyl CGP-12177A (IAPCGP), and [125I]iodocyanopindololdiazarene (ICYPdz) are similar in that their photoactive moieties are attached to the amino end of the antagonist pharmacophore. IABP derivatized TMs 5-7 and a peptide containing TM 1 to approximately equal extents. IAPCGP derivatized Tms 6 and 7 > TM 5 = TM 4 = TMs 2 and 3 = TM 1. ICYPdz derivatized TM 1 > TMs 6 and 7 > Tm 4. We conclude that the aryloxy end of the beta AR antagonist pharmacophore is highly constrained within TMs 6 and 7, whereas the amino terminus is much less constrained and able to assume multiple conformations. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that IABP, IAPCGP, and ICYPdz favor a folded conformation, with both ends close together. Derivatization of TMs 6 and 7 by IABP, IAPCGP, and ICYPdz suggests the folded conformation of these compounds in the ligand binding pocket.",

Mechanisms of steroid action are being studied with regard to the membrane receptors and the activation of second messengers. The present study investigated the mechanism for the rapid effect of estrogen on acutely dissociated hippocampal CA1 neurons by using the whole-cell, voltage-clamp recording. Under the perforated patch configuration, 17 beta-estradiol potentiated kainate-induced currents in 38% of tested neurons. The potentiation was stereospecific, rapid in onset, and reversible after the removal of the steroid. Dose-response curves show that the potentiation by 17 beta-estradiol was evident at a concentration as low as 10 nM and saturated at 10 microM. 17 beta-Estradiol did not affect the kinetics (i.e., affinity and cooperativity) and reversal potential of kainate-induced currents. This suggests that the potentiation did not result from direct interaction with kainate receptors nor the activation of ion channels other than kainate receptor-channels. The potentiation by 17 beta-estradiol was similar to the enhancement of kainate-induced currents evoked by 8-bromo-cAMP, and was modulated by an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (IBMX). The estrogen potentiation was blocked by a specific blocker of PKA (Rp-cAMPS). Under standard recording configuration, the effect was significantly affected by intracellular perfusing with GDP-beta-S or GTP-gamma-S. The data suggest that the potentiation of kainate-induced currents by 17-beta-estradiol was likely a G-protein(s) coupled, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation event. By involvement of this non-genomic mechanism, estrogen may play a role in the modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.",

However, when this combination fails to control blood pressure, it is not clear which drug is then additive.

Eighteen patients with a supine diastolic pressure of more than 90 mm Hg after at least 1 month on the combined treatment of amlodipine and lisinopril were enrolled in the study. The results show that in patients whose blood pressures are not controlled by the combination of amlodipine and lisinopril, the addition of bendrofluazide 5 mg once daily causes a significant fall in blood pressure compared with placebo and a significantly greater fall than 100 mg atenolol once daily.",

The average diastolic peak flow velocity was higher within the myocardial bridges (33 +/- 13 cm/s) than the proximal (26 +/- 13 cm/s) and distal bridges (17 +/- 4 cm/s, both p < 0.001).

Coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery were significantly more frequent in group I (p = 0.01 and 0.0008, respectively). Transient ischemia was associated with a higher cumulative probability of adverse events (p = 0.004).

    "93": "The long-QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary disorder characterized by an abnormally prolonged QT interval and by life-threatening arrhythmias. Recently, two of the genes responsible for LQTS have been identified: SCN5A, a voltage-dependent Na+ channel on chromosome 3 (LQT3), and HERG, responsible for the rapid component of the delayed rectifier current (IKr), on chromosome 7 (LQT2). We developed an in vitro model to attempt reproduction of the expected alterations in LQT3 and LQT2 patients. Guinea pig ventricular myocytes were exposed to anthopleura toxin A (anthopleurin), an inhibitor of the inactivation of the Na+ current, and to dofetilide, a selective blocker of IKr. Both interventions significantly prolonged action potential duration (APD), by 54 +/- 13 and 62 +/- 16 ms, respectively. Cells pretreated with anthopleurin significantly shortened APD in response to mexiletine, isoproterenol, and rapid pacing (from 264 +/- 38 to 226 +/- 32 ms after mexiletine, P < .001). On the contrary, cells exposed to dofetilide did not shorten the APD after mexiletine and even prolonged it after initial exposure to isoproterenol (from 280 +/- 25 to 313 +/- 20 ms, P < .001); during rapid pacing, APD was shortened but less (38 +/- 9 versus 60 +/- 11 ms, P < .05) than in anthopleurin-treated cells. This study shows that a cellular model for LQTS, based on the recent advances in molecular genetics, can provide adequate \"phenotypes\" of prolonged repolarization amenable to the testing of interventions of potential clinical relevance. We found differential responses to Na+ channel blockade, to beta-adrenergic stimulation, and to rapid pacing according to specific pretreatment with either anthopleurin (to mimic LQT3) or dofetilide (to mimic LQT2). These different responses in myocytes bear striking similarities with the differential response to analogous interventions in LQTS patients with mutations on the SCN5A and HERG genes.",

Although the Ca2+ channel is effectively regulated by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation, no enzymatic regulation of the exchanger protein has been identified as yet. Here we report that in frog ventricular myocytes, isoproterenol down-regulates the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, independent of intracellular Ca2+ and membrane potential, by activation of the beta-receptor/adenylate-cyclase/cAMP-dependent cascade, resulting in suppression of transmembrane Ca2+ transport via the exchanger and providing for the well-documented contracture-suppressant effect of the hormone on frog heart. The beta-blocker propranolol blocks the isoproterenol effect, whereas forskolin, cAMP, and theophylline mimic it. In the frog heart where contractile Ca2+ is transported primarily by the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, the beta-agonists' simultaneous enhancement of Ca2+ current, ICa, and suppression of Na+-Ca2+ exchanger current, INa-Ca would enable the myocyte to develop force rapidly at the onset of depolarization (enhancement of ICa) and to decrease Ca2+ influx (suppression of INa-Ca) later in the action potential. This unique adrenergically induced shift in the Ca2+ influx pathways may have evolved in response to paucity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase/phospholamban complex and absence of significant intracellular Ca2+ release pools in the frog heart.", 
    "105": "Congestive heart failure is a frequent disorder with an estimated prevalence of 0.4-2% in the general population. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder and new developments in its treatment, the prognosis of heart failure remains poor. All patients with heart failure should undergo diagnostic evaluation to determine the type of cardiac dysfunction, establish its etiology and orient treatment. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics and digoxin are the standard therapy for chronic congestive heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are indicated in all stages of heart failure, even in asymptomatic patients. Diuretics should be added in the presence of fluid retention. Digoxin remains an important component in the management of refractory symptoms and atrial fibrillation. Symptomatic improvement and reduced morbidity have been shown with all these drugs. However, improved survival has been documented for ACE inhibitors only. Currently, numerous drugs with different mechanisms of action are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Promising results have been published, mainly with beta-receptor blockers and newer positive inotropic substances. Rapidly growing evidence from basic research will advance our understanding of heart failure and hopefully pave the way for new preventive and therapeutic strategies in the near future.", 
    "106": "Total cellular creatine content is an important bioenergetic parameter in skeletal muscle. To understand its regulation we investigated creatine transport and accumulation in the G8 cultured skeletal myoblast line. Like other cell types, these contain a creatine transporter, whose activity, measured using a radiolabelling technique, was saturable (Km = 110 +/- 25 microM) and largely dependent on extracellular [Na+]. To study sustained influences on steady state creatine concentration we measured total cellular creatine content using a fluorimetric method in 48 h incubations. We found that the total cellular creatine content was relatively independent of extracellular creatine concentration, consistent with high affinity sodium-dependent uptake balanced by slow passive efflux. Accordingly, in creatine-free incubations net creatine efflux was slow (5 +/- 1% of basal creatine content per day over 6 days), while creatine content in 48 h incubations was reduced by 28 +/- 13% of control by the Na+, K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain. Creatine accumulation after 48 h was stimulated by treatment with the mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist noradrenaline, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, the beta 2-agonist clenbuterol and the cAMP analogue N6,2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, but was unaffected by the alpha 1 adrenergic agonist methoxamine. The noradrenaline enhancement of creatine accumulation at 48 h was inhibited by the mixed alpha- and beta-antagonist labetalol and by the beta-antagonist propranolol, but was unaffected by the alpha 2 antagonist phentolamine; greater inhibition was caused by the beta 2 antagonist butoxamine than the beta 1 antagonist atenolol. Creatine accumulation at 48 h was increased to 230 +/- 6% of control by insulin and by 140 +/- 13% by IGF-I (both at 3 nM). Creatine accumulation at 48 h was also increased to 280 +/- 40% of control by 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (at 70 microM) and to 220 +/- 35% of control by amylin (60 nM). As 3,3', 5-triiodothyronine, amylin and isoproterenol all stimulate the Na+, K(+)-ATPase, we suggest that they stimulate Na(+)-creatine cotransport indirectly by increasing the transmembrane [Na+] concentration gradient and membrane potential.", 
    "107": "Chronic treatment with organophosphate inhibitors of cholinesterases is known to bring about down-regulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the heart while its effect on the functionally antagonistic beta-adrenergic receptors is not known. We describe experiments in which rats were exposed to daily injections of diisopropylflurophosphate (DFP) and the density of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic binding sites in their cardiac atria was measured according to the binding of (3H)quinuclidinyl benzilate ((3H)QNB) and (-)-4-(3-tert-butylamino-2-hydroxy)-propoxy-(5,7-3H) benzimidazol-2-one ((3H)CGP 12177) as subtype non-specific muscarinic and beta-adrenergic ligands, respectively. Biphasic course of changes was discovered with both ligands. With the dosage scheme applied, the density of beta-adrenoceptors was augmented 24 h after the first dose of DFP and decreased to about one half of control values after 5 days of treatment with DFP. The density of muscarinic receptors was augmented after two days of treatment with DFP and decreased to about one half of control values after 5 days of treatment. Comparatively small changes in the heart rate were observed during the treatment, they reflected changes in the muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptor density. The finding of DFP-induced changes in the binding of (3H)CGP 12177 suggests that the mechanisms responsible for the control of the density of muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart cells are interconnected but potential roles of other factors involved in in vivo experiments deserve further analysis. The transient increase in the density of muscarinic receptors after two days of DFP treatment appears related to published data on transient stimulation by cholinergic agonists of the transcription of mRNAs for muscarinic receptors.",

This recommendation is based on outcome studies using these drugs that demonstrate reductions in major diseases that treatment of hypertension is intended to prevent: stroke and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

    "121": "Open-channel blockers of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAcChR) are widely thought to act sterically by entering and \"plugging\" the open channel of the nAcChR. However, quinacrine, a fluorescent open-channel blocker, has been recently shown to bind to the nAcChR at a site near the lipid bilayer while the receptor is in a closed, desensitized state, suggesting that at least one open-channel blocker might act allosterically outside the channel [Valenzuela et al. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 8238]. To determine whether or not quinacrine also binds near the lipid bilayer when the receptor is in an open state, a short-range lipophilic quencher (5-doxylstearate, 5-SA) was used to assess the proximity of the nAcChR-bound quinacrine to the lipid bilayer while the receptor was transiently open by an agonist. Initial experiments using a stopped-flow instrument established the conditions required to monitor a portion of the changes in quinacrine fluorescence associated with its binding to the receptor in the open state. 5-SA (80 microM) reduced the amplitude of the rapid agonist-induced change in quinacrine emission to 44% +/- 12% of the control value, indicating that the quinacrine was binding to a site proximal to the membrane-partitioned 5-SA. Control experiments established that 5-SA had no effect on the ability of the receptor to undergo agonist-induced conformational changes, suggesting that little, if any, 5-SA distributed into the channel lumen and perturbed the functional activity of the receptor. Together, the results indicate that quinacrine binds to a site on the open receptor that is in contact with the lipid bilayer and not in the channel lumen.", 
    "122": "In primary neuronal cultures derived from the visual cortex of embryonic day 16-18 rats, intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, was increased by bath application of glutamate in a dose-dependent manner. Noradrenaline applied alone had relatively small effects. However, when glutamate concentrations eliciting modest increases in [Ca2+]i were applied together with 1 microM noradrenaline, the increase in [Ca2+]i could be enhanced by a factor of up to eight. The synergistic effect was seen in 147 neurons out of a total of 215 cells observed in 54 experiments. The observed enhancement was much more obvious at low doses of glutamate than with higher doses, augmenting all submaximal calcium responses to similar asymptotic levels. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), the NMDA receptor antagonist, completely blocked the adrenergic enhancing effect (29/29 cells in 8 experiments). Among the antagonists specific to alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta subtypes of adrenoceptors, the beta antagonist propranolol most completely blocked the enhancing effect (13/14 cells in 4 experiments, reducing the effect by an amplitude of 90%). The involvement of the beta receptor pathway was further supported by the ability of a cAMP analog to mimic the enhancing effect of noradrenaline. On the other hand, an alpha 1 blocker showed no effect and an alpha 2 blocker showed only a relatively small effect. These results suggest that receptors for noradrenaline and glutamate colocalize on postsynaptic cortical cells and that adrenergic modulation of glutamate induced calcium influx most likely operate through the beta receptor pathway. It is further postulated that cortical ocular dominance plasticity may be at least partially implemented via a calcium dependent cascade.", 
    "123": "Expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos is known to increase in granule cells of the olfactory bulb following a sustained olfactory stimulation. Most granule cells displaying high levels of Fos accumulation are located in the bulbar columns defined by the odour-induced foci of high 2-deoxyglucose glomerular uptake. The present studies were undertaken in order to assess the possible involvement of centrifugal afferents in the modulation of odour-induced patterns of either 2-deoxyglucose accumulation or c-fos expression in the olfactory bulb. A unilateral olfactory peduncle section had no effect on the odour-induced 2-deoxyglucose foci but induced a significant decrease in the number of Fos-containing neurons in odour-selective areas of both olfactory bulbs, ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion. This suppressive effect was much more pronounced in the side ipsilateral to the peduncle section. It is concluded that c-fos expression induced by a sustained stimulation with propionic acid vapours is not only determined by the olfactory peripheral input but also by afferents of central origin. In order to estimate the contingent involvements of the cholinergic and noradrenergic afferents in this control of c-fos expression, we attempted to mimic the effects of the surgical deafferentation on odour-induced c-fos expression by using a pharmacological approach with selective cholinergic and noradrenergic antagonists. The beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol induced a suppression of the odour-related patterns of Fos accumulation similar to the one caused by the surgical deafferentation of the olfactory bulb. The muscarinic antagonist scopolamine did not alter c-fos expression in the odour-selective area but increased significantly Fos labelling in the other bulbar aspects. Pharmacological investigations indicate that the noradrenergic and cholinergic centrifugal systems are likely involved in the central modulation of c-fos expression in the OB. The Fos protein could be expressed as an early nuclear signal triggering further long-term modifications of the neuronal phenotype, in certain conditions of sensory stimulation involving the activation of centrifugal systems.", 
    "124": "Recent open clinical studies suggest that pindolol and buspirone may enhance the efficacy and/or shorten the latency to antidepressant action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in unipolar major depressive disorder. The present investigation addressed the possibility that these agents share the ability to enhance the extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-elevating response to the SSRI citalopram. For the purpose, in vivo microdialysis in the rat ventral hippocampus was employed. (-)-Pindolol (8 mg/kg s.c.) augmented the citalopram (5 mg/kg s.c.)-induced rise of extracellular 5-HT levels, whereas buspirone (5 mg/kg s.c.) failed to do so. This effect of (-)-pindolol probably reflects its ability to block 5-HT1A autoreceptors, thereby abating the citalopram-induced indirect activation of these sites (secondary to the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake and elevation of extracellular 5-HT in the midbrain raphe). The lack of effect of buspirone in this model indicates that the clinically observed antidepressant augmentation action of buspirone is not mediated indirectly, via enhanced extracellular levels of 5-HT.", 
    "125": "The RNR3 gene encodes the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Transcription of this gene is induced 12-fold in response to DNA damage or by a DNA replication blocker. To investigate cis-acting regulation, deletion analysis of the promoter region of the RNR3 gene was performed and we identified two upstream-repressing sequences in the RNR3 regulatory region. An 18-base-pairs fragment, termed DNA-damage responsive element 1 (DRE1) located between -212 and -194 in this region was found to be essential for the induction of RNR3. This fragment contained a negatively acting sequence where a protein factor bound to the region during normal growth but disappeared by exposure to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. The other repressive element homologue to DRE1 was located at -263 to -254. One possible upstream-activating sequence which regulates the basal expression of RNR3 was also found. These results show that at least three potential cis-elements are necessary for the inducible expression of yeast expression of yeast RNR3 in response to DNA damage.",

The fifth Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has incorporated systolic blood pressure into the new definitions of hypertension. Although the syndrome of white coat hypertension has been well defined, physicians should still rely on casual blood pressure readings taken in the office or clinic for treatment decisions. The levels of blood pressure used to determine risk or estimate prognosis have been based on office or clinic blood pressures. The JNC's suggestion that diuretics or beta blockers be the preferred initial therapy is based on evidence from long-term trials showing that these medications reduce morbidity and mortality not just for cerebrovascular, but also for cardiovascular diseases. The possibly adverse effects of diuretics or beta blockers on lipids and glucose metabolism have probably been overemphasized.",

After adjustment for different durations of treatment (mean duration of treatment, 25 weeks), left ventricular mass decreased 13% with ACE inhibitors, 9% with calcium channel blockers, 6% with beta-blockers, and 7% with diuretics. There was a significant difference between drug classes (P<.01): ACE inhibitors reduced left ventricular mass more than beta-blockers (significant, P<.05) and diuretics (tendency, P=.08). Similar differences between drug classes were found with regard to effect on left ventricular wall thickness (P<.05).",

The ACE inhibitors seemed to be more potent than beta-blockers and diuretics in the reduction of left ventricular mass index; calcium channel blockers were somewhat in the intermediate range. The ACE inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, calcium channel blockers emerged as first-line candidates to reduce the risk associated with left ventricular hypertrophy.", 
    "134": "Sotalol is together with amiodarone the most effective antiarrhythmic. Compared to class I antiarrhythmics it has less mortality. However, sotalol can, like class IA antiarrhythmics, release life-threatening attacks of torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia (TdP-VT), as proarrhythmia or by overdosing. TdP-VT appears in 2% of all patients treated with sotalol. In patients treated for ventricular tachycardias TdP-VT appears in 4%. Some factors increase the incidence of TdP-VT: reduced left ventricular function, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesiaemia, bradycardia, extended QT-interval and daily doses exceeding 320 mg. We recommend increased attention to these predisposing factors so as to prevent TdP-VT. Pharmacologically induced TdP-VT may be misdiagnosed as \"genuine\" ventricular tachycardia. This often results in increased doses of sotalol, which worsen the TdP-VT. Sotalol is renally excreted and TdP-VT can appear in patients with reduced renal function where normal doses are used. QTC prolongation above 550 ms. or severe bradycardia indicates risk of TdP-VT and should result in end of treatment or dose-reduction. Six case-stories are presented.",

Isolated spontaneously beating right, or electrically stimulated left rat atria were examined while heart rate, sinus node recovery time, developed force, and effective refractory period were measured at 35 and 20 degrees C. Thus, we wanted to investigate the influence of low temperature on the cardiac effects of midazolam. The preparations were exposed to seven progressively increasing concentrations of midazolam. At 35 degrees C, midazolam produced a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect and had a biphasic effect (shortening followed by lengthening) on the effective refractory period. These effects are best explained as due to a release of endogenous catecholamines, since the positive inotropy was completely blocked by propranolol. In reserpinized animals, there was no effect of midazolam. Midazolam, however, significantly decreased heart rate and increased the sinus node recovery time; these responses are believed to be direct effects. At 20 degrees C, midazolam had no effect on the developed force but, when a high concentration was administered, it significantly reduced the effective refractory period. Heart rate values were first increased and the reduced to control values. No effect on the sinus node recovery time was observed. Thus, hypothermia may reduce the catecholamine release and mask the effect of midazolam on cardiac tissue by mechanisms not yet fully understood.",

After blockade of beta-adrenoceptors with propranolol, the hypertensive effect of CCK-8 was observed in the control group but not in DM-group, whereas CCK-8 had no effect on arterial blood pressure in the both studied groups. Stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors with ISO exerted the hypotensive effect of CCK-8 similar as after administration of the amine alone in the control and diabetic rats. CCK-8 increased the cardiac contraction amplitude and had no effect on heart rate and coronary outflow in control hearts. The positive inotropic effect of the peptide was abolished in DM-group. After blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, CCK-8 decreased all studied parameters of isolated hearts, the effect was similar as after infusion of propranolol alone. In DM group, after blockade of beta-adrenoceptors CCK-8 evoked decrease in the cardiac contraction amplitude (as during infusion of propranolol) and heart rate (the effect was greater than that after beta-adrenoceptors antagonist). CCK-8 administrated with ISO increased amplitude, heart rate and decreased coronary outflow of isolated control heart as after administration of ISO alone: in DM-group only the positive inotropic effect was observed. DM modified the effect of CCK-8 in circulatory system of rats. CCK-8 evoked bradycardia independent of stimulation or blockade of beta-adrenoceptors, mainly in DM."
