Head-to-head comparison of the therapeutic efficacy among commercial iron chelators and a dual T- (TTCC) and L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blocker on cardiac function, mitochondrial function and the protein expression of cardiac iron transporters in thalassaemic mice in iron-overloaded conditions has not been assessed. What is the main finding and its importance? The dual TTCC and LTCC blocker efonidipine could provide broad beneficial effects in the heart, liver, plasma and mitochondria in both wild-type and thalassaemic mice in iron-overloaded conditions. Its beneficial effects are of the same degree as the three commercial iron chelators currently used clinically. It is possible that efonidipine could be an alternative choice in patients unable to take iron chelators for the treatment of iron-overload conditions. Iron chelation therapy is a standard treatment in thalassaemia patients; however, its poor cardioprotective efficacy and serious side-effects are a cause for concern. Previous studies have shown that treatment with L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers or dual T-type calcium channel (TTCC) and LTCC blockers decreases cardiac iron and improves cardiac dysfunction in an iron-overloaded rodent model. Currently, the head-to-head comparison of therapeutic efficacy among commercial iron chelators, a dual TTCC and LTCC blocker and an LTCC blocker on cardiac function, mitochondrial function and the protein expression of cardiac iron transporters in thalassaemic mice in an iron-overloaded state has never been investigated. An iron-overloaded state was induced in \u03b2-thalassaemic and wild-type mice. Cardiac iron overload was induced to a greater extent than in a previous study by feeding the mice with an iron-enriched diet for 4\u00a0months. Then, an LTCC blocker (amlodipine) or a dual TTCC and LTCC blocker (efonidipine) or one of the commercial iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferasirox or deferiprone) was administered for 1\u00a0month with continuous iron feeding. All treatments reduced cardiac iron deposition and improved mitochondrial and cardiac dysfunction in both types of mice. Only efonidipine and the iron chelators reduced liver iron accumulation, liver malondialdehyde and plasma malondialdehyde in these mice. Although all pharmacological interventions reduced cardiac iron deposition, they did not alter the protein expression levels of cardiac iron transporter. These findings indicated that efonidipine provided all benefits to the same degree as the three commercial iron chelators. These findings indicate that a dual TTCC and LTCC blocker could be beneficial for treatment of an iron-overloaded state.",

Patients were stratified into \u03b2-blocker users and \u03b2-blocker nonusers, and according to the presence of a HF diagnosis. We followed the patients \u2264 5 years after baseline. Six different cardiovascular outcomes were investigated, including all-cause mortality and fatal thromboembolic events. Crude event rates were ascertained and propensity-matched Cox regression was used to compare event rates according to \u03b2-blocker usage status. A total of 205,174 patients were included, where 39,741 patients had prevalent HF.

HRs from vital-sign data for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer enrolled in PROFILE 1005 and the crizotinib arm of PROFILE 1007 were analyzed. Sinus bradycardia (SB) was defined as HR <60 beats per minute (bpm). Magnitude and timing of HR changes were assessed. Potential risk factors for SB were investigated by logistic regression analysis. Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated according to HR decrease by <20 versus \u2265 20 bpm within the first 50 days of starting treatment. For the 1053 patients analyzed, the mean maximum postbaseline HR decrease was 25 bpm (standard deviation 15.8). Overall, 441 patients (41.9%) had at least one episode of postbaseline SB. The mean precrizotinib treatment HR was significantly lower among patients with versus without postbaseline SB (82.2 bpm vs. 92.6 bpm). The likelihood of experiencing SB was statistically significantly higher among patients with a precrizotinib treatment HR <70 bpm. PFS was comparable among patients with or without HR decrease of \u2265 20 bpm within the first 50 days of starting crizotinib. Decrease in HR is very common among patients on crizotinib. The likelihood of experiencing SB was statistically significantly higher among patients with a precrizotinib treatment HR <70 bpm. This is the first large-scale report investigating the association between treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and the development of bradycardia. HRs should be closely monitored during crizotinib treatment.",

To identify possible targets for early therapeutic intervention we focused on glutamate excitotoxicity, a major early pathogenic factor, and the effects of candesartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker of neuroprotective efficacy in cell cultures and rodent models of Alzheimer's disease. The overall goal of the study was to determine whether gene analysis of drug effects in a primary neuronal culture correlate with alterations in gene expression in Alzheimer's disease, thus providing further preclinical evidence of beneficial therapeutic effects.",

We performed genome-wide expression profile analysis and data evaluation by ingenuity pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis, compared with alterations in gene expression from two independent published datasets identified by microarray analysis of postmortem hippocampus from Alzheimer's disease patients. Preferential expression in cerebrovascular endothelial cells or neurons was analyzed by comparison to published gene expression in these cells isolated from human cortex by laser capture microdissection.", 
    "21": "Candesartan prevented glutamate upregulation or downregulation of several hundred genes in our cultures. Ingenuity pathway analysis and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that inflammation, cardiovascular disease and diabetes signal transduction pathways and amyloid \u03b2 metabolism were major components of the neuronal response to glutamate excitotoxicity. Further analysis showed associations of glutamate-induced changes in the expression of several hundred genes, normalized by candesartan, with similar alterations observed in hippocampus from Alzheimer's disease patients. Gene analysis of neurons and cerebrovascular endothelial cells obtained by laser capture microdissection revealed that genes up- and downregulated by glutamate were preferentially expressed in endothelial cells and neurons, respectively.",

Enantiopure synthesis of moprolol is mainly dependent on the chiral intermediate, 3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-propane-1,2-diol. Various commercial lipases were screened for the enantioselective resolution of (RS)-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)propane-1,2-diol to produce the desired enantiomer. Among them, Aspergillus niger lipase (ANL) was selected on the basis of both stereo- and regioselectivity. The optimized values of various reaction parameters were determined such as enzyme (15\u2009mg/mL), substrate concentration (10\u2009mM), organic solvent (toluene), reaction temperature (30\u2009\u00b0C), and time (18\u2009h).The optimized conditions led to achieving >49% yield with high enantiomeric excess of (S)-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)propane-1,2-diol. The lipase-mediated catalysis showed regioselective acylation with dual stereoselectivity. Further, the enantiopure intermediate was used for the synthesis of (S)-moprolol, which afforded the desired \u03b2-blocker.",

    "28": "Melanin has a high binding affinity for a wide range of drugs. The determination of the melanin binding capacity and its binding affinity are important, e.g., in the determination of the ocular drug distribution, the prediction of drug effects in the eye, and the trans-scleral drug delivery. The binding parameters estimated from a given data set vary significantly when using different isotherms or different nonlinear fitting methods. In this work, the commonly used bi-Langmuir isotherm, which assumes two classes of independent sites, is confronted with the Sips isotherm. Direct, log-log, and Scatchard plots are used, and the interpretation of the binding curves in the latter is critically analyzed. In addition to the goodness of fit, the emphasis is placed on the physical meaning of the binding parameters. The bi-Langmuir model imposes a bimodal distribution of binding energies for the sites on the melanin granules, but the actual distribution is most likely continuous and unimodal, as assumed by the Sips isotherm. Hence, the latter describes more accurately the distribution of binding energies and also the experimental results of melanin binding to drugs and metal ions. Simulations are used to show that the existence of two classes of sites cannot be confirmed on the sole basis of the shape of the binding curve in the Scatchard plot, and that serious doubts may appear on the meaning of the binding parameters of the bi-Langmuir model. Experimental results of melanin binding to chloroquine and metoprolol are used to illustrate the importance of the choice of the binding isotherm and of the method used to evaluate the binding parameters.",

A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta-blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta-blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta-analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta-blockers.However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co-morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta-blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta-analyses.",

Rates of treatment modification were significantly different across ADCs; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker users were less likely to receive treatment modifications compared with other ADCs. Mean time-to-treatment modification was more than 100 days for adding and uptitrating, and more than 140 days for switching and downtitrating. Patients intensifying treatment by adding medications were about 25% (vs. uptitration) and 50% (vs. switching) less likely to discontinue treatment.",

Laboratory exposure to pharmaceuticals on marine species has been performed without considering the input of the ecosystem flow. To unravel the ecosystem response to long-term exposure to propranolol we have performed long-term exposure to propranolol and low salinity in microcosms. We applied shotgun proteomic analysis to gills of Mytilus edulis from those Baltic Sea microcosms and identified 2071 proteins with a proteogenomic strategy. The proteome profiling patterns from the 587 highly reproductive proteins among groups define salinity as a key factor in the mussel's response to propranolol. Exposure at low salinity drives molecular mechanisms of adaptation based on a decrease in the abundance of several cytoskeletal proteins, signalling and intracellular membrane trafficking pathway combined with a response towards the maintenance of transcription and translation. The exposure to propranolol combined with low salinity modulates the expression of structural proteins including cilia functions and decreases the expression of membrane protein transporters. This study reinforces the environment concerns of the impact of low salinity in combination with anthropogenic pollutants and anticipates critical physiological conditions for the survival of the blue mussel in the northern areas.",

Two observers evaluated the hemangioma independently at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 months after the initiation of treatment. Changes in the hemangioma score values were evaluated using paired t test. Rebound growth and adverse effects were recorded. After treatment was completed, this combined therapy achieved clinical response in 100% of the patients (89/89). Significant positive effects were demonstrated at 1, 3, 6 months (p\u2009<\u20090.001), but not obvious after 6 months (p\u2009=\u20090.06). The response of IHs to the therapy was depending on the age at initial treatment. The average treatment duration was 6.48 (5.77-7.19) months. One patient (1.1%) relapsed after cessation of 6-month treatment, and 7 children (7.8%) developed side effects. Our study suggested that oral propranolol combined with topical timolol treatment is very effective and well-tolerated for compound IHs, which can be used as a first line treatment.",

The primary objective is to provide the most up-to-date information based on the strongest scientific rationale and that is easily applicable to daily clinical practice. Resistant hypertension is defined as uncontrolled blood pressure on office measurements and confirmed by out-of-office measurements despite a therapeutic strategy comprising appropriate lifestyle and dietary measures and the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents including a thiazide diuretic, a renin-angiotensin system blocker (ARB or ACEI) and a calcium channel blocker, for at least 4 weeks, at optimal doses. Treatment compliance must be closely monitored, as must factors that are likely to affect treatment resistance (excessive dietary salt intake, alcohol, depression, drug interactions and vasopressor drugs). If the diagnosis of resistant hypertension is confirmed, the patient should be referred to a hypertension specialist to screen for potential target organ damage and secondary causes of hypertension. The recommended treatment regimen is a combination therapy comprising four treatment classes, including spironolactone (12.5-25 mg per day). In the event of a contraindication or a non-response to spironolactone, or if adverse effects occur, a \u03b2-blocker, an \u03b1-blocker, or a centrally acting antihypertensive drug should be prescribed. Because renal denervation is still undergoing assessment for the treatment of hypertension, this technique should only be prescribed by a specialist hypertension clinic.",

SMS is characterized by subtle facial dysmorphology, short stature, sleep disturbances, and neurobehavioral abnormalities. Little is known about the manifestation of his unique case among Arab population and its strategic treatment.This study comes to present a case of SMS in an Arab newborn male who was born in spontaneous delivery on June 29, 2015, with tachypnea, tracheomalacia, and mild hypotonia. The newborn was admitted on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and various laboratory examinations and clinical examinations were performed.Throughout his hospitalization, feeding difficulties appeared and thus a peripheral venous catheter was inserted in the left leg.After 22 days of follow-up and hospitalizations, the patient status improved and he was discharged with recommendations to be in follow up in pediatric outpatient clinic.However, notwithstanding the different investigations, intermittent tachypnea continued at a rate of 72 to 77\u200abreaths/min. Search for diagnosis begin intensively owing to persistence of tachypnia, mild hypotonia, feeding difficulties, sleep disturbances, and mild dysmorphic facial features. Suspicions of genetic abnormalities were considered and blood samples were sent for chromosome analysis and for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) testing.The genetic results revealed the following: cytogenetic findings: 46, XY, del(17)(p11.2) and the FISH results: del(17)(p11.2p11.2) (D17S29). The chromosome diagnosis revealed an interstitial deletion of 17p11.2 and the diagnosis of the SMS was confirmed.Accurate clinical diagnosis, therapeutic assessments and a holistic management plans, including multidiscipline therapeutic strategies, periodic neuro-developmental assessments, and an early intervention programs, are recommended.However, cytogenetic analysis or FISH using an RAI1-specific probe is the most frequently used technique for DS. Sleep and behavioral disturbances treatment include a combination of the daytime dose of acebutolol with an evening oral dose of melatonin. Melatonin as chronobiotic, antioxidant, and analgesic agent showed to be effective in different primary sleep disorders and in those associated with neurobehavioral disorders. Based on the beneficial effect of melatonin, it will be useful to use serum levels of melatonin as a follow-up test.",

We suggest that propranolol is effective as a fear-reducing agent when paired with behavioral therapy soon after trauma when psychological stress is high, possibly preventing or dampening the later development of PTSD. In individuals who have already suffered from PTSD for a significant period of time, propranolol may be less effective at disrupting reconsolidation of strong fear memories. Also, when PTSD has already developed, chronic treatment with propranolol may be more effective than acute intervention, given that individuals with PTSD tend to experience long-term, elevated noradrenergic hyperarousal.",

Patients were stratified by heart rate (<70 and \u226570 beats/min) and compared using generalized linear models specified with gamma error distributions and log links for costs and proportional hazard models for mortality/hospitalization. Of 722 eligible patients, 582 patients (81%) were treated with \u03b2 blockers.

To elucidate psychological effects of false-positive mammograms, we studied impact on drug intake. Methods We calculated the ratio of drug use for women with false-positive versus women with normal mammograms, before and after the event, using population-based registers, 1997-2006. The ratio of the ratios (RRR) assessed the impact. Results Before the test, 40.3% of women from the false-positive group versus 36.2% from the normal group used anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. There was no difference in use of beta blockers. Hormone therapy was used more frequently by the false-positive, 36.6% versus 28.7%. The proportion of women using anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs increased with 19% from the before to the after period in the false-positive group, and with 16% in the normal group, resulting in an RRR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.92-1.14). RRR was 1.03 for beta blockers, 0.97 for hormone therapy. Conclusion(s) Drugs used to mitigate mood disorders were used more frequently by women with false-positive than by women with normal mammograms already before the screening event, while the changes from before to after screening were similar for both groups.

Beta blockers (BBs) may blunt the sympathetic effect and catecholamine surge associated with ruptured cerebral aneurysms and prevent cardiac dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preadmission BB therapy and cVSP, cardiac dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality following aSAH. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with aSAH who were treated at a tertiary high-volume neurovascular referral center. The exposure was defined as any preadmission BB therapy. The primary outcome was cVSP assessed by serial transcranial Doppler with any mean flow velocity \u2265 120 cm/sec and/or need for endovascular intervention for medically refractory cVSP. Secondary outcomes were cardiac dysfunction (defined as cardiac troponin-I elevation > 0.05 \u03bcg/L, low left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%, or LV wall motion abnormalities [LVWMA]) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The cohort consisted of 210 patients treated between February 2009 and September 2010 (55% were women), with a mean age of 53.4 \u00b1 13 years and median Hunt and Hess Grade III (interquartile range III-IV). Only 13% (27/210) of patients were exposed to preadmission BB therapy. Compared with these patients, a higher percentage of patients not exposed to preadmission BBs had transcranial Doppler-mean flow velocity \u2265 120 cm/sec (59% vs 22%; p = 0.003). In multivariate analyses, lower Hunt and Hess grade (OR 3.9; p < 0.001) and preadmission BBs (OR 4.5; p = 0.002) were negatively associated with cVSP. In multivariate analysis, LVWMA (OR 2.7; p = 0.002) and low LVEF (OR 1.1; p = 0.05) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Low LVEF (OR 3.9; p = 0.05) independently predicted medically refractory cVSP. The in-hospital mortality rate was higher in patients with LVWMA (47.4% vs 14.8%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The study data suggest that preadmission therapy with BBs is associated with lower incidence of cVSP after aSAH. LV dysfunction was associated with higher medically refractory cVSP and in-hospital mortality. BB therapy may be considered after aSAH as a cardioprotective and cVSP preventive therapy.",

It has been shown that Carvedilol protects cells against mitochondrial dysfunction. However, it's unknown whether Carvedilol affects mitochondrial biogenesis. In this study, we found that treatment with Carvedilol in HUVECs resulted in a significant increase of PGC-1\u03b1, NRF1, and TFAM. Notably, Carvedilol significantly increased mtDNA contents and the two mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and COX IV. In addition, MitoTracker Red staining results indicated that treatment with Carvedilol increased mitochondria mass. Mechanistically, we found that the effect of Carvedilol on the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 is mediated by the PKA-CREB pathway. Importantly, our results revealed that stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by carvedilol resulted in functional gain of the mitochondria by showing increased oxygen consumption and mitochondrial respiratory rate. The increased expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and mitochondrial biogenesis induced by Carvedilol might suggest a new mechanism of the therapeutic effects of Carvedilol in heart failure.",

The sodium channel isoform NaV1.6 contributes to pain behaviors and spontaneous activity in this model. Among all isoforms in adult DRG, NaV1.6 is the main carrier of tetrodotoxin-sensitive resurgent Na currents that allow high-frequency firing. Resurgent currents flow after a depolarization or action potential, as a blocking particle exits the pore. In most neurons, the regulatory \u03b24 subunit is potentially the endogenous blocker. We used in vivo siRNA-mediated knockdown of NaV\u03b24 to examine its role in the DRG inflammation model. NaV\u03b24 but not control siRNA almost completely blocked mechanical hypersensitivity induced by DRG inflammation. Microelectrode recordings in isolated whole DRG showed that NaV\u03b24 siRNA blocked the inflammation-induced increase in spontaneous activity of A\u03b2 neurons and reduced repetitive firing and other measures of excitability. NaV\u03b24 was preferentially expressed in larger diameter cells; DRG inflammation increased its expression, and this was reversed by NaV\u03b24 siRNA, based on immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. NaV\u03b24 siRNA also reduced immunohistochemical NaV1.6 expression. Patch-clamp recordings of tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na currents in acutely cultured medium diameter DRG neurons showed that DRG inflammation increased transient and especially resurgent current, effects blocked by NaV\u03b24 siRNA.

Beta blockers (BB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldosterone antagonists have been shown to reduce hospitalizations, morbidity, and mortality in HFrEF while long-acting inhaled bronchodilators (beta-2-agonists and anticholinergics) and corticosteroids have been endorsed for COPD treatment. The opposing pharmacotherapy of BBs and beta-2-agonists highlight the conflict in prescribing BBs in COPD and beta-2-agonists in HFrEF. This has resulted in underutilization of evidence-based therapy for HFrEF in COPD patients owing to fear of adverse effects. This review aims to provide an update and current perspective on diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with coexisting COPD and HFrEF.",

Second, heart failure and stroke reductions were significantly related to SBP, DBP and pulse pressure reductions. Third, in 18 BP-lowering RCTs excluding baseline heart failure from recruitment, heart failure reduction ('new-onset' heart failure) [RR 0.58 (0.44-0.75)] was very similar to that in the entire set of RCTs. Fourth, in meta-analyses of head-to-head comparisons of different antihypertensive classes, calcium antagonists were inferior in preventing 'new-onset' heart failure [RR 1.16 (1.01-1.33)]. However, this inferiority disappeared when meta-analysis was limited to RCTs allowing concomitant use of diuretics, \u03b2-blockers or renin-angiotensin system blockers also in the calcium antagonist group [RR 0.96 (0.81-1.12)].",

Separate analyses were performed comparing outcomes in patients prescribed/not prescribed beta blocker and antiplatelet agents. Analyses were adjusted for effects of baseline covariates on probability of treatment and on clinical outcome. Over a median follow-up period of 3.8\u00a0years, antiplatelet therapy was associated with a reduced risk for death (relative risk, 0.52 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.31-0.89]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02).

The final study population comprised 5,259 patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was the incidence of severe LV dysfunction defined as an ejection fraction <40% at hospital discharge. Oral \u03b2 blockers were administered soon (\u226424\u00a0hours) after hospital admission in 1,377 patients and later (>24\u00a0hours) during hospital stay in the remaining 3,882 patients. Early \u03b2 \u200bblocker therapy was significantly associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.80) and reduced incidence of severe LV dysfunction (odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.78). Significant mortality benefits with early \u03b2 \u200bblocker therapy disappeared when patients with Killip class III/IV were included as dummy variables. The results were confirmed by propensity score-matched analyses. In conclusion, in patients with ACSs, earlier administration of oral \u03b2 \u200bblocker therapy should be a priority with a greater probability of improving LV function and in-hospital survival rate. Patients presenting with acute pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock should be excluded from this early treatment regimen.",

After nifedipine administration, the maximal hypotensive effect appeared about 10\u00a0min after starting the infusion, then BP started to elevate although the plasma concentration increased, supposedly because of a negative feedback mechanism generated from the homeostatic mechanism. After propranolol administration, HR decreased by half, and this bradycardic effect was greater than that with nifedipine. Wide variation in QT was observed when the propranolol concentration exceeded 700\u00a0ng/mL. This variation may have been caused by arrhythmia.

Cardiac autonomic blockers were administered alone and in combination, so that heart rate (HR) could be measured (1) under resting conditions, (2) with either autonomic branch blocked, and (3) with both branches blocked (which provided intrinsic HR, iHR). SVB was assessed as the ratio of resting HR to iHR. This calculation pointed to a sympathetic predominance in untreated SHRs and even more so in WKY rats, and to a marked vagal predominance in pyridostigmine-treated SHRs. By contrast, the ratio between low and high frequency components (LF/HF) of RR interval spectra did not significantly differ between the groups. Each autonomic tone was quantified as the HR change induced by its selective blocker or as the difference between iHR and HR after blockade of its counterpart. Both pharmacological methods indicated vagal enhancement in treated SHRs, but provided opposite results in terms of vagal vs. sympathetic predominance. These data seriously question the use of the LF/HF ratio as an index of SVB, and the possibility to reliably estimate vagal and sympathetic tones separately through current pharmacological approaches in conscious rats.",

After 10 days of treatment, the levels of free hormones were significantly reduced with fT4 concentrations slightly elevated (fT4, 26.7 [17-36.4] pmol/l, p <0.001 compared with corresponding pretreatment values), and the fT3 concentration was normal in 8/10 patients (fT3, 6.1 [4.6-7.6] pmol/l, p <0.001 compared with corresponding pretreatment values). All patients were clinically euthyroid with a heart rate of <80/min. Drug tolerability was excellent, and there were no side effects or exacerbation of hyperthyroidism. The peri- and postoperative course was uneventful in all cases. Adrenal function was normal in 7 out of 10 patients 4-6 weeks postoperatively.

The mechanisms and management of intradialytic hypertension have been explored in numerous research studies over the past few years.", 
    "218": "Patients with intradialytic hypertension have been found to be more chronically volume overloaded compared to other hemodialysis patients, although no causal role has been established. Patients with intradialytic hypertension have intradialytic vascular resistance surges that likely explain the BP increase during dialysis. Acute intradialytic changes in endothelial cell function have been proposed as etiologies for the increase in vascular resistance, although it is unclear if endothelin-1 or some other vasoconstrictive peptide is responsible. There is an association between dialysate to serum sodium gradients and BP increase during dialysis in patients with intradialytic hypertension, although it is unclear if this is related to endothelial cell activity or acute osmolar changes. In addition to probing the dry weight of patients with intradialytic hypertension, other management strategies include lowering dialysate sodium and changing antihypertensives to include carvedilol or other poorly dialyzed antihypertensives.", 
    "219": "Hemodialysis patients with intradialytic hypertension have an increased mortality risk compared to patients with modest decreases in BP during dialysis. Intradialytic hypertension is associated with extracellular volume overload in addition to acute increases in vascular resistance during dialysis. Management strategies should include reevaluation of dry weight and modification of both the dialysate prescription and medication prescription.",

A 48-year old male patient presented at our emergency department with abdominal pain and a clinical presentation of shock. There had been an episode of chest pain three days before admission. Electrocardiogram was suggestive for old myocardial infarction. Coronarography revealed an occlusion of a diagonal branch. Computed Tomography scan was performed to exclude a rupturing aortic aneurysm, but a large pericardial effusion was seen. Echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade and pericardiocentesis was performed. Conservative treatment consisting of bed rest, blood pressure control and beta-blocker therapy was applied, allowing the patient to be discharged after 10 days. The diagnosis of LVFWR was confirmed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.Surgery is considered as the golden standard in treatment of LVFWR. This case illustrates that in selected patients conservative treatment is possible.", 
    "226": "We investigated the role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in spontaneously hypertensive rats with erectile dysfunction. Firstly, we evaluated intracavernous pressure. The bioavailability of IGF-1 at both mRNA and protein levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. Then, cavernous cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cavernosal pressure was significantly decreased in the hypertensive and the propranolol treatment groups compared to the normal control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Cavernous IGF-1 bioavailability and the concentrations of cavernous cyclic guanosine monophosphate were both significantly decreased in the hypertensive and the propranolol treatment groups compared to the normal control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). This study suggests that an obvious decrease in cavernous IGF-1 levels might play an important role in spontaneously hypertensive rats with erectile dysfunction.",

Box-Behnken design was employed to identify the effect of factors (% ethanol, % diethylamine and flow rate) and their interactions on enantioresolution and analysis time. Chromatography was performed using mobile phase comprising acetonitrile, ethanol and DEA (92:8:0.2% v/v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 1.2mLmin(-1) on a Lux Cellulose-4 column. The enantiomers were monitored at a wavelength of 240nm and separation was achieved within 8min. The method was validated in terms of specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection and quantification. The method was found to be linear (R(2)\u22650.991), accurate (99.8-101.4%) and precise (%RSD\u22643%). Additionally, fractional factorial design was used to evaluate the robustness of the method and non-significant intervals for mixture related factors were established using contour profiling. Furthermore, the pertinence of this validated method was established by analyzing three different commercially available formulations. The obtained results confirmed that the proposed method can be extended for routine enantiopurity assay of amlodipine and atenolol in pharmaceutical formulations.",

The outcome of the study was the simultaneous use of medicines recommended for secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome: platelet antiaggregant, beta-blockers, statins and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. The independent variables were: sex, age, education in years of attending, monthly income in tertiles and percutaneous coronary intervention. We described the prevalence of use of each group of medicines with their 95% confidence intervals, as well as the simultaneous use of the four medicines, in all analyzed periods.

Acquiring cyclic rigid analogs to obtain more selective drugs is interesting. Thus, we used whole cells of yeast strains Pichia glucozyma and Candida glabrata to catalyze the reduction of several 2-arenoxycycloalkanones to produce chiral 2-arenoxycycloalcohols with good/excellent enantioselectivity. In both cases, the alcohol configuration that resulted from the carbonyl group reduction was S. Yeast P. glucozyma allowed the conversion of both enantiomers of the starting material to produce 2-arenoxycycloalcohols with configuration (1S, 2R) and (1S, 2S). The reaction with C. glabrata nearly always allowed the kinetic resolution of the starting ketone, recovering 2-arenoxycycloalkanone with configuration S and (1S, 2R)-2-arenoxycycloalcohol.All the four possible stereoisomers of 2-phenoxycyclohexanol and the two enantiomers of 2-phenoxycyclohexanone were obtained by combining the biocatalyzed reaction with the oxidation/reduction of the chiral compounds with standard reagents.

The primary and secondary end points were all-cause mortality and HF readmission, respectively. In total, 86 deaths and 240 HF readmissions were recorded. The predictive values of baseline LVEF at admission and LVEF 6 months posttreatment were analyzed and compared. The posttreatment LVEFs were predictive for future events (P = 0.01 for all-cause mortality, P < 0.001 for HF readmission), but the baseline LVEFs were not. In Protocol 2, the outcomes of patients with improved LVEF (change of LVEF: \u2265+10%), unchanged LVEF (change of LVEF: -10% to +10%), and reduced LVEF (change of LVEF: \u2264-10%) were analyzed and compared.
