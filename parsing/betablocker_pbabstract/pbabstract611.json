Second, the receptor mechanisms by which sympathetic nerve stimulation alters the secretion rates of somatostatin and insulin were assessed. Pancreata of mongrel puppies were perfused in situ with nonrecirculated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (150 mg/dl glucose). Buffer flow was adjusted between 0.2 and 4 ml/min X g pancreas. Insulin secretion rate (nanograms per min/g pancreas; ISR) as well as pancreatic O2 and glucose consumption increased as flow increased between 1 and 2 ml/min X g, where each reached a maximum plateau. Thus, ISR was shown to be dependent on flow over the middle range of flow investigated. In separate experiments, bilateral stimulation of the splanchnic nerves or pancreatic arterial infusion of norepinephrine to a final concentration of 60 microM decreased ISR and the somatostatin secretion rate (SSR). Adrenergic suppression of ISR was antagonized by phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine. Adrenergic inhibition of SSR was blocked only by phenoxybenzamine. Propranolol had no effects. We conclude that norepinephrine is sufficient to account for sympathetic inhibition of ISR and SSR (e.g. it is not necessary to postulate another transmitter) and that this inhibition may be transmitted through an effect on the islet vasculature or an effect on the islet cells themselves. The types of alpha-adrenoceptors mediating the adrenergically induced decrease in ISR differ from those causing the decrease in SSR.", 
    "1": "Primary culture of bovine adrenal subcapsular cells was used to investigate direct effects of catecholamines on aldosterone secretion. Cells dispersed with collagenase and DNAse and cultured at high density (1.5-2 million/ml) for 3 days displayed high sensitivity to angiotensin II and ACTH, with an ED50 of 1.4 and 1.5 nM, respectively. Adrenergic agonists elicited a 4- to 6-fold stimulation of aldosterone secretion with potency order (-)isoproterenol greater than (-)epinephrine equals (-)norepinephrine greater than (+)isoproterenol, and corresponding ED50 5, 240, 213, and 3000 nM, respectively. No reproducible inhibition by dopamine of basal or stimulated levels of aldosterone secretion could be detected, but a weak stimulatory effect was sometimes observed at high concentration greater than 10 microM. (-)Isoproterenol stimulation of aldosterone production was potently inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonists (-)alprenolol and (+)alprenolol with potencies of 1.8 and 110 nM, respectively. The alpha-adrenergic antagonists prazosin, yohimbine, and phentolamine only weakly inhibited (-)isoproterenol stimulation with potencies of 5, 13, and 140 microM, respectively. The potent beta 2-adrenergic antagonist ICI 118.551 and the weaker beta 1-adrenergic antagonist atenolol were roughly equipotent with potencies of 0.27 and 0.44 microM, respectively. Addition of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 at 10 microM doubled the maximum stimulation effect of (-)isoproterenol without changing the potency of the catecholamine or the basal level of aldosterone secretion, suggesting a potential role of cAMP as a mediator of isoproterenol stimulation. These results indicate the presence of a beta 1-adrenergic receptor stimulating aldosterone secretion in bovine zona glomerulosa cells. The physiological significance of direct beta-adrenergic stimulation of aldosterone production is currently being assessed.", 
    "2": "In order to determine the relative efficacy and dose equivalency of propranolol four times a day and nadolol once daily for the treatment of stable angina pectoris, ten patients were studied in a double blind randomized placebo controlled crossover study. Total daily doses of propranolol and nadolol were determined by titrating until an equivalent degree of reduction in the heart rate response to exercise was achieved. At these doses, the treadmill exercise time to 0.1 mV of electrocardiographic ST-segment depression was increased from 248 +/- 75 seconds on placebo to 405 +/- 56 seconds on propranolol (p less than 0.05) and 471 +/- 46 seconds on nadolol (p less than 0.01). Also, the mean frequency of angina decreased from eight attacks per week on placebo to three on propranolol and nadolol (both p less than 0.05). In six of the ten patients, the effective total daily dose of propranolol and nadolol was identical, and the dose ratio for all ten patients was 1.17:1, propranolol to nadolol. However, individual dose titration is recommended when switching from propranolol four times a day to nadolol once daily because of the dosage variability noted in 40 percent of the patients.", 
    "3": "The effect of 4-6 weeks' treatment with propranolol and nadolol on effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was studied, in 14 patients with essential hypertension, in single blind, random and cross-over design. Both drugs caused comparable effective lowering of pulse and blood pressure. When taken as the first drug, propranolol caused significant reduction in ERPF and GFR and a rise in filtration fraction (FF) and renal vascular resistance (RVR), whereas nadolol caused distinct rise in ERPF and a fall in FF and RVR but GFR remained unchanged. These haemodynamic effects were reduced when propranolol was given immediately after the withdrawal of nadolol and were obviated when nadolol followed propranolol therapy. This suggested a carry-over effect of the first drug into the second phase of treatment. We conclude that with short term therapy in essential hypertension, propranolol has a renal vasoconstrictor and nadolol a vasodilator effect.", 
    "4": "Ten subjects with hypertension received medroxalol, which blocks both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, has intrinsic sympathomimetic beta 2-agonist properties and is a direct vasodilator. Renal function tests consisting of inulin clearance and p-amino hippuric acid (PAH) clearance, plasma renin activity (PRA) in recumbent and upright postures, and aldosterone excretion rate were performed. After intravenous medroxalol, inulin clearance and PAH clearance rose, renal vascular resistance fell, recumbent PRA was unchanged, and the rise in PRA with upright posture was blunted. After 1 mo on oral medroxalol, blood pressure was controlled while inulin clearance, PAH clearance, and renal vascular resistance were unchanged. The rise in PRA with upright posture remained blunted. Urinary aldosterone excretion was unchanged after 1 mo on medroxalol.", 
    "5": "Seventy four patients (66 men, eight women; mean age 54.3 years) underwent submaximal exercise testing 7-23 days (mean 10.7) after acute myocardial infarction. Follow up was a mean period of 11.3 months. When compared with patients with no exercise induced abnormality, ST segment elevation, ST shift (depression or elevation or both), ST depression, inability to complete five metabolic equivalents, and inadequate blood pressure response to exercise were predictive of subsequent cardiac events (cardiac death, left ventricular failure, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina). When the presence or absence of specific variables was assessed, only ST elevation and ST shift predicted subsequent cardiac events. The presence of exercise induced ST elevation was the only exercise test variable which predicted cardiac death. ST segment elevation was, therefore, the exercise induced abnormality which best predicted the risk of future complications.", 
    "6": "A survey of current literature suggests an increasing interest in both the desirable and undesirable implications of a prolonged QT interval, the former perceived to be the beneficial effect of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the duration of ventricular action potential, and the latter considered to be a potential marker for sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic heart disease. In addition, there has been an increasing interest in the congenital long QT syndrome associated with an apparent dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and serious, potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Circumstantial evidence suggests that these arrhythmias are due to increased dispersion of repolarization which may be aggravated by psychologic and emotional perturbations. In this review, the associations between the long QT interval, autonomic nervous system, dispersion of repolarization, antiarrhythmic drugs and ventricular arrhythmias are examined. Attention is directed to the difficulties of accurate QT measurement, problems related to the correction of the QT interval for heart rate and sex (QTc), the wide range of normal values and the modest QT alterations after various manipulations of the autonomic nervous system. Clinical conditions associated with marked, moderate and occasional QT lengthening are listed and discussed briefly in relation to the disturbances of nervous system, dispersion of ventricular repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. It is proposed that the absence of relevant animal models of neurogenic or psychogenic QT prolongation hinders the investigation of the neurogenic factors associated with QT lengthening. QT prolongation is most often induced by antiarrhythmic drugs and ischemic heart disease. However, it is not known whether the occurrence of torsade de pointes type of ventricular tachycardia in patients treated with antiarrhythmic drugs is related to a critical drug dose or a critical degree of QTc prolongation. There is no conclusive evidence that QT lengthening has any predictive value either during the acute phase or during convalescence after myocardial infarction. Also, a serious deficiency in current knowledge is the lack of an established relation between the prolonged QT interval and the dispersion of ventricular repolarization. It is concluded that the number of unanswered questions discussed in this review still makes it difficult to judge when a prolonged QT interval is good, bad or indifferent.", 
    "7": "The beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency and cardiodepressant activity of penbutolol and its two isomers have been evaluated in the guinea-pig left atrium in order to determine if the two properties are related. While (-)-penbutolol was ten times more potent than (+)-penbutolol and three times more potent than (+/-)-penbutolol as a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, the three compounds showed a similar activity as cardiodepressant agents. These results seem to demonstrate that it is unlikely that this depressant action can be related to the antagonism of beta adrenoceptors.", 
    "8": "We examined the effects of cyclic AMP (cAMP) on the intracellular Ca2+ release in both the intact and skinned arterial smooth muscle. The amount of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was estimated indirectly by caffeine-induced contraction of the skinned preparation and directly by caffeine-stimulated 45Ca efflux from the previously labeled skinned preparation. The norepinephrine-induced release contraction was markedly enhanced by dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) and reduced by propranolol. The stimulatory effect of dbcAMP was best observed when the muscle was exposed to 10(-5) M dbcAMP and 2 X 10(-6) M norepinephrine was used to induce the release contraction. 10(-5) M cAMP had no effect on the Ca2+-induced contraction or on the pCa-tension relationship in the skinned preparation. This concentration of cAMP increased Ca2+ uptake into the SR of the skinned preparation when the Ca2+ in the SR was first depleted. 10(-5) M cAMP stimulated Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the SR after optimal Ca2+ accumulation by the SR. The results indicate that the stimulatory effect of cAMP on the norepinephrine-induced release contraction could be due to enhancement of the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the SR in arterial smooth muscle.", 
    "9": "The effects of orally given activated charcoal, sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride on the pharmacokinetics of sotalol were studied in 7 volunteers in a randomized, cross-over study. Serum and urine concentrations of sotalol were determined by HPLC up to 72 h. Activated charcoal, 50 g, given within 5 min of sotalol hydrochloride (160 mg), reduced its absorption by 99%. When given in repeated doses from 6 h on, 50 g followed by 12.5 g at 6 h intervals, charcoal shortened the half-life after sotalol in serum from 9.4 +/- 0.4 h to 7.6 +/- 0.3 h and in urine from 9.4 +/- 0.4 h to 7.3 +/- 0.3 h (p less than 0.01). The excretion of unchanged sotalol into urine was 65% of the dose during the control phase but neither acidification nor alkalinization of urine for 3 days did increase its urinary excretion. Thus, activated charcoal seems to be effective in prevention of the absorption of sotalol when ingested without delay. Given in repeated oral doses charcoal moderately increases the rate of sotalol elimination, probably by interrupting its enterohepatic or enteroenteric circulation.", 
    "10": "The apparent equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of isoproterenol with beta-receptors and adenylate cyclase were determined under the same conditions in rat adipocyte membranes and were compared with the apparent dissociation constant for the interaction of isoproterenol with cyclic AMP accumulation in the adipocyte. From these determinations, it was calculated that the occupancy of less than 4% of the receptor population is required for half-maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase in membranes and cyclic AMP accumulation in intact cells, provided that receptor-binding and adenylate cyclase assays are performed in the presence of guanine nucleotides. Since guanine nucleotides are also required for adenylate cyclase activation in intact cells, it is concluded that the beta-receptors of rat adipocytes are \"spare\" receptors.", 
    "11": "beta-Adrenoceptors present in smooth muscles of the cistern wall of teats of lactating cows were identified and characterized by 3H-dihydroalprenolol (DHA) binding. Binding association and dissociation at 37 degrees C were very rapid (t1/2 amounting to 2 min and 1 min 30 sec respectively), stereospecific and saturable. By Scatchard analysis, the mean receptor density was 92 fmol of 3H-dihydroalprenolol bound/mg protein and the dissociation constant was 0.63 nM. The Hill number was 1.01. The order of potency of catecholamines for the binding was (-)-isoproterenol greater than (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine, indicating a population of mainly beta 2-adrenoceptors. Potency series of 10 antagonists and 15 agonists, determined from binding-inhibition experiments, were composed.", 
    "12": "The effects of preincubation for 10 min with synthetic porcine neuropeptide Y (NPY) on muscle tone and autonomic transmission in the guinea-pig right atrium, vas deferens, urinary bladder, portal vein and trachea were analysed in vitro. NPY induced a metoprolol-resistant, long-lasting, positive inotropic and chronotropic effect per se in the spontaneously beating right atrium. Furthermore, NPY caused a reversible inhibition of both the metoprolol and atropine-sensitive auricle responses to field stimulation (2 Hz or 4 Hz for 2 s) without affecting the response to exogenous noradrenaline (NA) or acetylcholine (ACh). NPY did not induce any contraction of the vas deferens, but inhibited both the rapid twitch response and the sustained tonic contraction induced by field stimulation. The NPY-induced inhibition of the tonic contraction was more long-lasting than that of the twitch response. The tonic contraction was blocked by phentolamine and the twitch response by alpha-, beta-methylene ATP tachyphylaxis. NPY did not inhibit the contractile effects of NA, ATP or alpha-, beta-methylene ATP. NPY also induced a reversible reduction of the non-cholinergic, non-adrenergic contractile response to field stimulation of the urinary bladder. In the portal vein, NPY (up to 5 X 10(-7) M) did not inhibit the spontaneous motility or the phentolamine-sensitive contractile responses to field stimulation and NA. The atropine-sensitive contraction of the trachea or the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic relaxation induced by field stimulation were not significantly influenced by NPY in doses up to 5 X 10(-7) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "The effect of thyroid hormone on the beta-adrenergic receptor in foetal cardiac membranes was analysed by measuring the binding of (-)[3H]DHA. The specific activities (per mg protein) of beta-adrenergic receptors decreased with advancing gestational age, whereas the total activities (per heart) increased under the similar conditions. The change in the binding affinities was not statistically significant. 1; 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T3) stimulated the (-)[3H]DHA binding capacities of the cardiac membranes of foetuses of all age groups. The enhancement in the receptor activity was completely inhibited actinomycin D or cycloheximide. The contents of epinephrine, norepinephrine and cAMP increased with advancing gestational age; but T3 had no significant effect on the catecholamines or cAMP. Similarly, the activities of the basal, NaF stimulated and Gpp(NH)p stimulated adenylate cyclase remained unaltered by T3, but the activities increased progressively with foetal maturity. The absolute values of catecholamine stimulated adenylate cyclase activities in the hearts of T3 treated foetuses were, however, higher compared to those in the untreated foetuses. The enhancement of the activities were totally blocked by the action of actinomycin D, cycloheximide or propranolol. Our results indicate that thyroid hormone enhances the number of beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites by synthesizing new receptor proteins resulting in increased catecholamine sensitivity.", 
    "14": "From each of 14 women undergoing laparotomy at different stages of the luteal phase of the cycle, the corpus luteum (CL) was excised, cut into pieces and incubated for 120 min. Incubations were performed in the absence and presence of hCG and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). In addition, noradrenaline (NA) was added to the incubation medium of newly formed CL, and the adrenergic blocker propranolol to incubated specimens of mid-luteal phase CL. After incubation the tissue levels of protein and cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the media concentrations of progesterone (P) were determined. In young CL, PGF2 alpha did not interfere with the stimulatory effect of hCG on neither cAMP nor P formation, while in CL of the mid-luteal phase PGF2 alpha significantly counteracted the stimulatory effect of hCG on these two parameters. In the presence of propranolol, however, this antigonadotrophic effect of PGF2 alpha in vitro was abolished. Furthermore, when NA was added to specimens of young CL, PGF2 alpha significantly counteracted the stimulatory effect of hCG on both cAMP and P formation. These in vitro data show that endogenous catecholamines may regulate the antigonadotrophic, 'luteolytic' effect of PGF2 alpha in human CL.", 
    "15": "The cardiotonic drugs AR-L57 [2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-1H-imidazo(4,5b)-pyridine] and isoproterenol stimulated contractility in cultured heart cells in concentration-dependent manners; only the effects of isoproterenol were blocked by propranolol. Isoproterenol, but not AR-L57, enhanced the phosphorylation state of seven protein bands [relative molecular weights (MrS) 155,000, 96,000, 27,000, 24,000, 20,000, 16,000, 12,000] and resulted in the dephosphorylation of one protein band (Mr 21,000). Also, only isoproterenol increased the activation states of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase and glycogen phosphorylase. The eight protein bands resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography were altered by isoproterenol in time- and concentration-dependent manners. The 24,000-Mr protein substrate phosphorylated in response to isoproterenol was converted to a 12,000-Mr species by heating in the presence of SDS prior to electrophoresis, suggesting that the two substrates were in fact identical proteins. A comparison of the 2-min responses to varying concentrations of isoproterenol resulted in excellent correlations between the phosphorylation states of individual protein bands and contractility. This was true even for the 21,000-Mr species that was dephosphorylated. However, only the 27,000-, 24-12,000-, and 16,000-Mr substrates were phosphorylated rapidly enough to be associated with the onset of the inotropic response. Cultured myocytes are an important feature of these studies as they are 84% pure ventricular cells that remain 100% viable throughout an experiment. Because this system is suitable for biochemical measurements and the effects of agents on heart cell contractility can be determined, it is possible to correlate changes in biochemical parameters with alterations in physiological state.", 
    "16": "Although clinical reports have suggested that antihypertensive therapy can control blood pressure in patients with renovascular hypertension, adequate randomized studies comparing medical versus surgical management are lacking. It is well recognized that progressive deterioration in renal function can occur despite good blood pressure control. Recent experience suggests that higher-risk patients with atherosclerotic renovascular hypertension can benefit from an aggressive surgical approach, whereas newer medical therapies capable of specific inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system suggest greater potential benefits to other patients. Properly performed randomized trials comparing medical versus surgical therapy of renovascular hypertension are needed.", 
    "17": "The clinical and diagnostic features of catecholamine secreting glomus tumors are reviewed. Three cases are reported, including the first documented case of a dopamine secreting glomus jugulare tumor. Based on this experience, the authors have outlined the indications for selective venous catheterterization studies and for pharmacologic blockage in the management of these patients. In addition to routine urinary screening, a high index of clinical suspicion is needed to avoid the complications associated with catecholamine secreting tumors.", 
    "18": "The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory actions of the beta adrenergic receptor antagonist, dl-sotalol, were examined in the canine heart subjected to myocardial ischemic injury. Programmed electrical stimulation of the heart was done 4 to 7 days after a 2-hr occlusion followed by reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The resulting dysrhythmias consisted of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 1), sustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 5) or polymorphous ventricular tachycardia degenerating to ventricular fibrillation (n = 3). After dl-sotalol (8 mg/kg), programmed stimulation failed to produce ventricular arrhythmias in five animals with only nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed in the other animals. Epicardial activation delays produced in ischemically injured myocardium by premature ventricular stimuli were not altered by treatment with sotalol. However, the increase in ventricular refractoriness (156 +/- 5 msec predrug vs. 191 +/- 7 msec post 8 mg/kg of sotalol, P less than .01) prevented the introduction of premature ventricular stimuli at coupling intervals previously producing ventricular tachyarrhythmias despite the presence of continuous diastolic electrical activity recorded with epicardial composite electrodes over the region of chronic myocardial injury. In a conscious canine model which spontaneously develops ventricular fibrillation, dl-sotalol (2 mg/kg, n = 7; 8 mg/kg, n = 13) decreased the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and increased survival at 24 hr (13 of 20, 65% vs. control, 1 of 15, 7%; P less than .001). Composite electrograms recorded from the anterior and posteriorlateral surfaces of the heart demonstrated the rapid development of activation delays on the posteriorlateral surface with the appearance of ischemic ST segment changes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "The chronotropic response of right atria isolated from 5-day-cold-exposed rats to isoproterenol and norepinephrine was studied. A large increase in the sensitivity of the pacemaker to isoproterenol and a decrease in the sensitivity to norepinephrine occurred. Determination of pA2 values of propranolol and metoprolol using isoproterenol and norepinephrine as agonists and analysis of the slopes of Schild plots suggested that in atria isolated from control rats the chronotropic effect of isoproterenol and norepinephrine resulted from the preferential interaction of the catecholamines with a homogeneous beta-1 adrenoceptor population. After cold exposure the affinity of atrial adrenoceptors for propranolol increased when the agonist was isoproterenol and decreased when norepinephrine was used. The slopes of the Schild plots of metoprolol when the agonists were isoproterenol or norepinephrine were not unitary unless the experiments were performed in the presence of butoxamine. However, butoxamine prevented the demonstration of cold-induced super-sensitivity to isoproterenol, leaving the subsensitivity to norepinephrine unaffected. It is concluded that cold-induced heterogeneity of the atrial beta adrenoceptors is responsible for the increased sensitivity to isoproterenol. Probably, subsensitivity to norepinephrine resulted from conformational alterations of the atrial beta-1 adrenoceptors.", 
    "20": "A reduction of the thirst was observed one hour after intramuscolar injection of 0.3 mg/kg propranolol in the rat; this effect was not observed with higher doses. According to work hypotheses, small doses could act blocking renal beta-adrenergic receptors: the stopped renin emission reduces angiotensin production that is the basic factor of thirst. The AA hypothesize that the lack of the effect in response to higher doses of propranolol can be explained through a different action of this drug which antagonizes the first one.", 
    "21": "In an attempt to elucidate the relationship between phosphatidylinositol breakdown and alpha-adrenergic responses, effects of phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol related metabolites on Ca2+ mobilization and glucose output in cultured hepatocytes were examined. Norepinephrine induced the net 45Ca2+ efflux from preloaded cells and stimulated glucose output via alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation, whereas phosphatidic acid caused 45Ca2+ uptake to cells and did not stimulate glucose output. Myo-inositol-monophosphate, diglyceride and arachidonic acid, which are released by phosphatidylinositol breakdown, had no effect on 45Ca2+ efflux and glucose output in cells. These results suggest that phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol related metabolites can not mimic the alpha-adrenergic actions in cultured hepatocytes.", 
    "22": "The concept of antifibrillatory action distinct from antiarrhythmic effect has recently been recognized. An antiarrhythmic (antiectopic) action leads to a decrease in the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats. In contrast, an antifibrillatory drug action increases myocardial electric stability, decreasing the propensity for ventricular fibrillation. Agents with predominant antiarrhythmic action (designated class I) include lidocaine, quinidine, procainamide and disopyramide. Bretylium is an agent with predominant antifibrillatory action (class III). Amiodarone and sotalol are experimental class III drugs. The beta-blockers (class II) also possess antifibrillatory action, particularly in ischemic heart disease. The rationale for the use of agents with antiarrhythmic (antiectopic) effects is the reduction of triggering events for more complex ventricular tachyarrhythmias. These agents act by slowing conduction, decreasing abnormal automaticity and affecting phase IV depolarization. In contrast, agents with antifibrillatory action may exert little effect on cardiac conduction and automaticity. However, they raise the energy threshold required for premature electrical discharge to initiate ventricular fibrillation (ventricular fibrillation threshold). The inhomogeneity of electrophysiologic properties and adrenergic tone in different portions of the heart may be reduced or eliminated. Direct electrophysiologic effects of agents such as bretylium include a general lengthening of the refractory period and the action potential duration in the heart and a diminution in the disparity of their durations between normal and abnormal myocardium. Clinical studies are incomplete, but they support the concept of antifibrillatory therapy. In postmyocardial infarction patients at intermediate risk of sudden death, the broad use of oral antiarrhythmic agents has not decreased the incidence of sudden death, whereas high-dose beta-blocker therapy, which exerts experimental antifibrillatory effects, may reduce sudden death by 30 to 70%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "A multicenter randomized single-blind study was performed to evaluate the effects of propranolol administered during the evolution of myocardial infarction. Five centers enrolled a total of 269 patients, with 134 receiving propranolol and 135 placebo. Propranolol or placebo was given intravenously upon randomization (0.1 mg per kilogram of body weight) and then orally for nine days to keep the heart rate between 45 and 60 beats per minute. Less than 2 per cent of patients were treated within 4 hours after the onset of symptoms, but 50 per cent received therapy within 8 hours of onset of chest pain, and the remainder between 8 and 18 hours. The heart rates in the propranolol-treated group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (P less than 0.001). Base-line characteristics, including the mean heart rate (79.6 vs. 81.3) and the left ventricular ejection fraction (49.0 vs. 49.5), were similar in the two groups. The primary end point evaluated--infarct size as estimated from plasma MB creatine kinase activity--was virtually identical in the two groups, averaging 13.3 and 13.6 gram-equivalents of MB creatine kinase per square meter of body-surface area. Peak plasma levels of the enzyme were also similar in the two groups. No significant difference was observed between the propranolol and placebo groups in the change in left ventricular ejection fraction, extent of area involved in pyrophosphate uptake, R-wave loss on electrocardiograms, or mortality (after three years). These results do not support the use of propranolol administered four or more hours after the onset of symptoms to limit infarct size.",

    "25": "At 0.9 mM CaCl2 taurine prevented the negative inotropic effect due to low calcium concentration in guinea-pig ventricular strips but not in rat strips. This taurine effect was dose-dependent. The presence (in the perfusion medium) of beta-alanine, an inhibitor of taurine transport, antagonized the effect of taurine suggesting that the action of taurine was correlated to its transport. Neither propranolol, cimetidine nor indomethacin affected the response to taurine in guinea-pig ventricular strips.", 
    "26": "The effects of adrenalectomy on cell calcium metabolism and on the effects of epinephrine on cAMP, phosphorylase a activity, and calcium efflux were studied in hepatocytes isolated from adult male and female rats. Adrenalectomy increased the total calcium of hepatocytes, all exchangeable calcium pools, and all calcium fluxes between the cellular pools in both sexes. After adrenalectomy, basal cAMP was elevated, phosphorylase a + b was decreased, but basal phosphorylase a activity was not changed. In adrenalectomized males and at all concentrations of epinephrine studied (1.10(-8)-1.10(-5)M) stimulation of calcium efflux was decreased and cAMP accumulation was enhanced, while the resulting phosphorylase a activation was depressed. In hepatocytes from adrenalectomized females there was a similar increase in cAMP accumulation induced by epinephrine, and a decrease in the stimulation of calcium efflux; however, the depression in phosphorylase a activation was much less and was significant only at 1.8(-8) and 1.10(-5)M epinephrine. In the male, while activation of phosphorylase a shifted from a pure alpha-adrenergic response mediated by calcium to one also involving a cAMP-mediated beta-adrenergic response, the contribution of the attenuated calcium signal was still significant. Hepatocytes from female rats did not show a comparable alpha- to beta-shift, since the relative contribution of calcium and cAMP to phosphorylase activation was similar in sham-operated and adrenalectomized animals.", 
    "27": "In groups of propranolol-treated pithed rats pretreatment with either verapamil (1 mg/kg i.a., 20 min) or the inorganic calcium entry blocker (CEB), cobalt (23.8 mg/kg i.a., 20 min) reduced maximum obtainable pressor responses to the relatively selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist B-HT 920 (0.1-1000 micrograms/kg i.v.) equally, by approximately 50%. Verapamil and cobalt at these doses had little or no effect upon pressor responses induced by the relatively selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist cirazoline (0.1-1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). Phenoxybenzamine (0.1 mg/kg i.v., 15 min) displaced to the right and reduced by 44% the maximum obtainable pressor responses to cirazoline. Treatment of animals with the combination of either verapamil or cobalt followed by phenoxybenzamine, at the dose levels and pretreatment times given above, produced significantly greater inhibitions of cirazoline pressor responses (83% and 88% reduction in the maximum obtainable pressor responses to cirazoline respectively) than were observed following administration of phenoxybenzamine alone. Since yohimbine (1 mg/kg i.v.) did not significantly affect the residual responses to cirazoline following treatment with phenoxybenzamine the mechanism responsible for this interaction between CEBs and phenoxybenzamine is not mediated via postjunctional alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Additional studies are required to assess the involvement of a possible subtype of alpha 1-adrenoceptors which appear to mediate vascular responses sensitive to CEBs.", 
    "28": "This report describes the uptake of L-[propyl-2,3-3H]dihydroalprenolol, a beta-adrenergic antagonist, by HeLa (human adenocarcinoma) cells. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol binds to sites of high capacity and low affinity in intact HeLa cells. The binding achieves equilibrium rapidly and is rapidly reversible. Bound [3H]dihydroalprenolol is displaceable by beta-adrenergic antagonists in a nonstereoselective fashion, but is not displaceable by isoproterenol, an adrenergic agonist. Phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, and chloroquine, a lysosomotropic amine, also compete for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites. [3H]Dihydroalprenolol binding is inhibited by metabolic inhibitors, but not by cytoskeletal blocking agents. The binding is sensitive to extracellular pH (less binding at lower pH) and is temperature-sensitive (less binding at lower temperatures). The bound radioligand is rapidly reversed following hypotonic lysis of the cells. These [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding sites in intact HeLa cells therefore do not have the characteristics expected for beta-adrenergic receptors. Further studies showed that beta-adrenergic receptors could be detected in a HeLa membrane preparation using [125I]iodohydroxybenzylpindolol, and that chloroquine had very low affinity for these receptors. We conclude that [3H]dihydroalprenolol diffuses across the plasma membrane of intact HeLa cells and accumulates in acidic intracellular compartments.", 
    "29": "A randomized, double-masked, cross-over study of nine healthy normal subjects was conducted to determine whether indomethacin affected the ocular hypotensive action of timolol maleate. A significant decrease in intraocular pressure occurred with timolol maleate 0.5% eyedrops (used twice a day) alone. Indomethacin (25 mg three times a day, given orally) administered concurrently had no effect on timolol's hypotensive action. No subjective or objective side effects occurred and there were no significant changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, or respiratory rate with either treatment.", 
    "30": "The stereoisomer form of timolol used in the treatment of glaucoma is l-timolol. Although d-timolol is a less potent beta-adrenergic receptor blocker than l-timolol, several laboratory studies have found that d-timolol has ocular hypotensive effects. Thus, d-timolol may be a useful therapeutic agent for glaucoma that has fewer systemic side effects than l-timolol. We conducted a randomized, double-masked, single-drop study of the effects of d-timolol and placebo on intraocular pressure in 34 patients with ocular hypertension. d-Timolol significantly lowered intraocular pressure for the six-hour duration of the study. No patients receiving the drug reported subjective side effects. There was no change in visual acuity, pupil size, or results of external ocular or slit-lamp examinations during the study. No changes in pulse rate or blood pressure were attributable to the drug.", 
    "31": "On 24 patients with ascertained hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy in a long-term experiment over 6 months the effect of 30 mg Nifedipin per day on subjective and objective parameters was investigated and compared with Propranolol. The subjective symptoms were in a larger extent improved by Propranolol than by Nifedipin. In contrast to Propranolol Nifedipin had no influence on the systolic function on the basis of the systolic time intervals. The diastolic heart function, assessed by means of the cardiographic criteria of the apex, was improved by Nifedipin in circa the same extent as by Propranolol. The results altogether allow the conclusion that the application of Nifedipin seems to be reasonable in patients with contraindication to beta-receptor-blockers or Verapamil or when there is no reaction to these preparations. When there is no satisfying result, a combination with beta-blockers should also be attempted.", 
    "32": "Effects of the new cardiotonic and selective beta 1-adrenergic agonist TA-064, (-)-(R)-1-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino] ethanol, on circulating concentrations of glucose, lactate, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, cyclic AMP and the pancreatic hormones insulin (IRI) and glucagon (IRG) were examined in rats. TA-064, administered orally or intraperitoneally at the dose of 10 mg/kg (ca. 50 times the therapeutic dose) or higher, caused a slight transient rise followed by a persistent lowering of blood glucose concentrations, but it did not affect blood lactate levels at all. The same treatment with TA-064 elevated the concentrations of blood FFA, glycerol and plasma IRI and IRG. These changes induced by TA-064 were inhibited by pretreatment with propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist) and practolol (a selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist). The non-selective beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the selective beta 2-adrenergic agonist terbutaline elevated both blood glucose and lactate when administered intraperitoneally. They also brought about sustained rises in blood glycerol and plasma IRI, but only transiently increased the plasma IRG level. The cardiotonic agent prenalterol, claimed to be a selective beta 1-agonist, elevated blood glucose, lactate, and glycerol only slightly, and plasma IRI significantly, but it had no effect on plasma IRG. The cardiotonic agents dobutamine and amrinone also elevated blood glucose. Thus, TA-064 is unique among the beta-adrenergic and other cardiotonic agents in that it produces sustained hypoglycemia while it has no lactacidemic effect. Since this hypoglycemic action of TA-064 was always preceded by a rise in plasma IRI and abolished in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, we conclude that increased secretion of pancreatic insulin and the lack of hyperglycemic action are responsible for the hypoglycemia by high doses of TA-064.", 
    "33": "Ten beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs varying in lipophilicity and beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency were examined for inhibitory effects on synaptosomal [3H]noradrenaline uptake. All compounds produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of noradrenaline uptake, but were at least one order of magnitude less potent than desmethylimipramine and cocaine. The order of potency was pronethalol greater than propranolol greater than betaxolol greater than alprenolol greater than oxprenolol greater than practolol greater than metoprolol greater than acebutolol greater than sotalol greater than atenolol, with IC50 values ranging from 4.0 X 10(-6) to 2.2 X 10(-3) M. Uptake inhibition was unrelated to beta-adrenoceptor blocking potency, but was highly correlated with drug lipophilicity. (+)-Propranolol was an effective uptake inhibitor, as was the local anaesthetic procaine. Kinetic analysis of uptake inhibition by propranolol, oxprenolol, metoprolol and procaine revealed a mixed inhibition for all four agents examined. It is suggested that this effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockers may be mediated, at least in part, by an action on membrane phospholipids associated with the noradrenaline carrier protein, and that noradrenaline uptake inhibition may underlie certain central side-effects observed with some drugs in this group.", 
    "34": "We examined the effects of a cardioselective beta-blocking drug on exercise-induced regional myocardial ischemia in 10 conscious dogs with chronic coronary artery stenosis. An ameroid constrictor, Doppler flowprobe, and hydraulic cuff were placed around the left circumflex coronary artery, and left ventricular pressure (LVP), systolic wall thickening (% delta WT; by sonomicrometry), and myocardial blood flow (MBF; microspheres) were measured during control standing, control treadmill exercise, and identical exercise after atenolol (1 mg/kg po). Prior to study, in every dog % delta WT and MBF in the ischemic area were normal at rest, indicating collateral development. During control exercise, % delta WT in the ischemic region markedly decreased from 27 to 4%, and transmural ischemia was evident in that region. Heart rate, systolic LVP, and LV (+)dP/dt were significantly lower during exercise after atenolol than during control exercise. % delta WT in the normal area was only 81% of that during control exercise, but dysfunction in the ischemic area was improved (77% increase compared with control exercise). Accompanying the improved function was a significant increase of MBF/beat and relative MBF in the ischemic zone; the endocardial-to-epicardial ratio increased from 0.27 to 0.47. Thus atenolol improved regional MBF distribution, thereby diminishing exercise-induced regional myocardial dysfunction and accelerating its recovery.", 
    "35": "The experience with captopril is limited in patients who are hypertensive after renal transplantation. An increased risk of side effects has been expected because of immunosuppressive therapy and a reduced renal function. We have used captopril in 58 transplanted patients with hypertension. On previous antihypertensive treatment diastolic blood pressure could not be maintained below 100 mm Hg. All patients were on immunosuppressive therapy using prednisolone in combination with azathioprine or cyclosporin. Before captopril went mean s-creatinine concentration was 225 \u00b1 143 \u03bcmol/l. Fifty-four patients were treated for more than four weeks and 28 of them for six months or more. The mean daily dose captopril was 90 mg. All patients also used furosemide and 2/3 were on a beta-blocker. Captopril was discontinued in nine cases within the first two months, in three because of an unsatisfactory effect on BP, in four because of side effects and in two after successful treatment of a renal artery stenosis of the transplant. The Patients who were treated with captopril within the first year after transplantation responded better than patients where treatment was started more than one year after transplantation (p < 0.05). Half of the patients given captopril early even showed a decrease of s-creatinine during treatment. Captopril in combination with a diuretic and a beta-blocker, reduces blood pressure in patients with treatment resistant hypertension following renal transplantation. The risk for serious side effects is small provided that the captopril dose is and white cell counts and s-creatinine levels are closely monitored.", 
    "36": "The efficacy and tolerability of the new ACE-inhibitor enlalapril (MK 421) and the beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker atenolol for the treatment of primary hypertension were compared in a double blind parallel study. 12 patients were randomized to each drug. The doses of enalapril were 20 and 40 mg o.d and of atenolol 50 and 100 mg o.d. for 4 weeks each, whereafter hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 or 50 mg o.d. was added if necessary to achieve a supine diastolic blood pressure (BP) <90 mm Hg 24 hours after drug intake. Supine BP was reduced from 160\u00b17/111\u00b14 mm Hg to 153\u00b113/101\u00b19 mm Hg (p<0.05/p<0.005) with enalapril and from 163\u00b117/109\u00b16 mm Hg to 145\u00b111/95\u00b17 mm Hg (p<0.005/p<0.001) with atenolol. The addition of HCTZ caused a profound additive BP reduction to 132\u00b17/88\u00b16 mm Hg with enalapril and to 130\u00b110/88\u00b17 mm Hg with atenolol. There was no significant difference between the efficacy of enalapril and atenolol alone or combined with HTCZ. The reduction in mean arterial pressure with enalapril tended to correlate with pre-treatment stimulated plasma renin activity and 24 hours urinary kallikrein excretion. Both drugs tended to reduce serum and urinary aldosterone and kallikrein excretion to the same extent. There was one drop-out in each group, one due to impotence on the combination of enalapril and HCTZ and one due to peripheral coldness during atenolol treatment. Other side effects were mild. No toxic adverse effects were registered.", 
    "37": "In a 36-year-old woman with malignant hypertension and moderate renal insufficiency from nephrosclerosis normotension was not achieved by the combination of a beta-blocker, a vasodilator, and a loop-diuretic. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril was then added to the therapy. The blood pressure control was good. However, due to adverse reactions, captopril had to be withdrawn. Later on, the patient was successfully treated with enalapril, another ACE inhibitor, without the relapse of any adverse reactions.", 
    "38": "Using the radioactive microsphere technique, we investigated the interaction between atenolol and hydralazine after acute administration in conscious hypertensive rabbits. Hydralazine, 0.3 mg/kg i.v., increased heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output and decreased total peripheral resistance. Only at higher doses (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg i.v.) was a fall in arterial blood pressure observed due to a further reduction in total peripheral resistance. The drug caused vasodilatation in the heart, brain, kidneys, skeletal muscles, diaphragm, chest wall and large intestine and a, probably reflex-mediated, vasoconstriction in the skin, stomach and small intestine. In the heart hydralazine preferentially increased blood flow to the outer layers of the left ventricular wall, which resulted in a significant decrease in the endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio. Hydralazine also greatly enhanced the percentage of 15-micron microspheres distributed to the lungs, indicating an increased arteriovenous anastomotic flow. Atenolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) elicited bradycardia and moderately reduced blood pressure due to a decrease in cardiac output. Pretreatment with atenolol attenuated the cardiac stimulation and thereby accentuated the hypotensive effect of hydralazine, 0.3 mg/kg. With the high hydralazine dose (3.0 mg/kg) the synergistic effect on blood pressure disappeared due to an increase in cardiac output, despite effective beta adrenoceptor blockade. Moreover, atenolol interfered with the vasodilator response of hydralazine in the heart, skeletal muscles and the arteriovenous anastomoses. The beta adrenoceptor antagonist increased the endocardial/epicardial blood flow ratio and thereby abolished the negative effect of hydralazine on this parameter. In conclusion, the antihypertensive drugs acted synergistically only at a low hydralazine dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Cyproheptadine was compared with nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem for calcium entry blocker activity in isolated cardiovascular preparations. Using rat aortic strips, all compounds (10(-7) M) inhibited both the contraction caused by the readdition of calcium (1.0 mM) into regular buffer or buffer containing potassium (130 mM) or norepinephrine (10(-5) M) and the potassium-stimulated uptake of 45Ca. The rank order of potency for these experiments was in general nifedipine greater than cyproheptadine greater than or equal to verapamil greater than diltiazem. The same order of potency also was found for the four compounds in relaxing potassium (40 mM)-contracted aortic strips (IC50 values: nifedipine, 2.6 X 10(-9) M; cyproheptadine, 6.3 X 10(-8) M; verapamil, 7.6 X 10(-8) M; and diltiazem, 2.1 X 10(-7) M), but cyproheptadine was the least potent agent in antagonizing the spontaneous contractions of the rat portal vein (IC50 values: nifedipine, 6.6 X 10(-9) M; verapamil 7.7 X 10(-8) M; diltiazem 9.6 X 10(-8) M; and cyproheptadine 3.9 X 10(-7)M). None of the compounds (10(-7) M) inhibited the contraction to norepinephrine (10(-5) M) in rabbit aortic strips bathed in calcium-free buffer (1 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N'-tetraacetic acid). Nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem were more potent in inhibiting the restoration of contractility by isoproterenol in potassium-depolarized rabbit papillary muscles than decreasing force in normally polarized muscles; cyproheptadine was equipotent when tested in these two preparations. Cyproheptadine was the least potent of the four compounds in lowering perfusion pressure in the perfused canine hindlimb.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "40": "We studied the protective effect of metoprolol on emetine induced T wave changes in rabbits. None of the rabbits who were beta-blocked before administration of emetine develop the T wave changes observed consistently in the control group. These observations support our clinical impression that emetine-induced T wave changes are produced because of stimulation of peripheral sympathetic nervous system and can be effectively prevented by prior and concomitant beta-blockade.", 
    "41": "We report the case of a 9-year-old boy suffering from exzematous dermatitis who was treated for 6 years with a daily dose of 100 mg of a dermatological ointment containing 9 alpha-fluoroprednisolone-21-acetate. At examination the patient's blood pressure was persistently 230/160 mm Hg and was considered essential in origin after secondary forms of arterial hypertension had been excluded. Treatment with nifedipine and labetalol lowered the blood pressure to 150/100 mm Hg. When we became aware of the dermatological treatment, we advised its discontinuance. In the subsequent 7 days, the blood pressure fell to hypotensive levels (75/40 mm Hg) and then became normal a few days after discontinuance of the antihypertensive therapy. This case suggests that prolonged use of topical steroids, commonly prescribed for skin diseases, may cause hypertension, especially in childhood.", 
    "42": "A 53-year-old black male with no history of neuropsychiatric behavioral problems was treated successfully with propranolol, furosemide, and minoxidil for previously uncontrolled hypertension. However, paranoid ideations, illusions, severe combativeness, and visual hallucinations developed shortly after initiation of the listed therapy. When atenolol was substituted for propranolol, all psychotic behavior resolved.", 
    "43": "Isolated, buffer perfused guinea pig hearts were used to study the effects of sotalol on arrhythmias and electrophysiology during 30 min of myocardial ischaemia, induced by reducing coronary flow to 10% of control, and subsequent reperfusion. Action potentials were recorded using the floating microelectrode technique and arrhythmias were noted and defined by extracellular electrical records. Sotalol 10(-4) mol X litre-1 reduced the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion. Prior to the onset of ischaemia sotalol reduced action potential amplitude and Vmax, and prolonged action potential duration, refractory period, and conduction time, and increased pacing threshold. During myocardial ischaemia the effect of sotalol on action potential duration disappeared, and that on refractory period was diminished. The effect of sotalol on action potential amplitude and Vmax was reduced during the early (2 to 12 min) part of ischaemia, but later, at the onset of arrhythmias, tended to reemerge, while the effect on QRS width was exaggerated. Thus the cellular electrophysiological effects of sotalol on normal myocardium provided a poor guide to the mechanism of its antiarrhythmic action in ischaemic tissue.", 
    "44": "Open-chest dogs and pigs anaesthetized with pentobarbitone were used to evaluate the anti-arrhythmic effect of prazosin and propranolol during a 30 min period of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 15 min of re-perfusion. In dogs, both prazosin and propranolol reduced the incidence of ventricular premature depolarizations and ventricular tachycardia during the occlusion period. During the 45 min period of occlusion and re-perfusion, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation was significantly reduced in the prazosin-treated and propranolol-treated dogs. In pigs prazosin reduced the incidence of ventricular premature depolarizations during occlusion and propranolol reduced the incidence of both ventricular premature depolarizations and ventricular tachycardia during occlusion, but the incidence of ventricular fibrillation was not significantly reduced in the prazosin- and propranolol-treated pigs. Prazosin reduced arterial pressure and propranolol lowered heart rate in both dogs and pigs, but a comparison of mean arterial pressure and heart rate in animals surviving and those not surviving the 30 min of coronary artery occlusion and 15 min of re-perfusion showed no significant difference.", 
    "45": "The kinetics and dynamics (inhibition of exercise tachycardia) of two controlled-release preparations of propranolol (Elanolol and Inderal LA) were examined in six normal volunteers. Conventional propranolol (Inderal) was also studied for comparison purposes. As compared to conventional propranolol (120 mg), single doses of Elanol (120 mg) and Inderal LA (160 mg) produced a smoother serum level profile, with lower and delayed peak times. Dose-corrected AUC0-24 values were greater after Elanol than after Inderal LA (651 +/- 147 vs 402 +/- 159 ng ml-1 h, means +/- s.e. mean, P greater than 0.05). The profile of inhibition of exercise tachycardia mirrored closely that of the serum levels. At steady state, all regimens studied (Inderal 40 mg three times daily; Elanol 120 mg once daily; Inderal LA 160 mg once daily) ensured relatively sustained serum levels and a stable degree of pharmacological effect. Dose-corrected AUC0-24 values were 797 +/- 148 ng ml-1 h after Inderal, 908 +/- 113 ng ml-1 h after Elanol and 602 +/- 122 ng ml-1 after Inderal LA. The bioavailability of Inderal LA was significantly lower than that of the other preparations. These results demonstrate that long-acting formulations of propranolol can be developed which are not necessarily associated with reduced bioavailability secondary to enhanced first-pass metabolism.", 
    "46": "Species differences in binding of basic drugs have only occasionally been studied and we have therefore measured the binding of the beta-adrenergic blockers oxprenolol and propranolol in (1) serum of healthy humans, dogs, rats and rabbits and of rabbits with experimental arthritis, (2) a solution of albumin of these species and (3) a solution of human alpha 1-AGP. In humans, dogs, rats and arthritic rabbits, binding of oxprenolol and propranolol was much higher in serum than in albumin solution; in healthy rabbits serum binding was very low and not different from albumin binding. For both drugs, concentration-dependency was seen in serum of dogs, humans and rats and of arthritic rabbits; a similar concentration-dependency was found for human alpha 1-AGP solution, but not for human albumin and for serum of healthy rabbits. Tris (2-butoxyethyl)-phosphate (TBEP), a known displacer of drugs from alpha 1-AGP in humans, decreased binding in serum of all species except the rabbit. For both beta-blockers, species differences in capacity constants were found; species differences in affinity constants were present only for propranolol. These results suggest that in humans, dog and rat, but much less in rabbits, oxprenolol and propranolol bind mainly to alpha 1-AGP and that binding to alpha 1-AGP is more important for oxprenolol than for propranolol.", 
    "47": "Seven patients with chronic relapsing polyneuropathy and four patients with dysgammaglobulinemic polyneuropathy had tremor during the course of their illness. The tremor was coarse, irregular, and unrelated to proprioception loss, muscle weakness, or fatigue; it appeared to represent disease activity or an early sign of a new relapse. None of these patients had clinical signs of CNS disease or family history of essential tremor. The tremor in all seven patients with relapsing neuropathy and in one of the three treated patients with dysgammaglobulinemia responded to immunosuppressive drugs that controlled the underlying immune mechanism(s) of the disease. In two patients with dysgammaglobulinemic polyneuropathy, the tremor improved with propranolol hydrochloride.", 
    "48": "We investigated the effects of autonomic drugs and the role of intestinal contents on the motility changes that occur during acute obstruction. Myoelectric activity was recorded from seven electrodes spaced at 3-cm intervals along the midjejunum of nine conscious dogs. Another animal had electrodes evenly placed throughout the small bowel. Obstruction was created by inflation of an intraluminal balloon. Systemic arterial blood pressure and pulse rate were monitored. Initially, motor activity of the small intestine increased proximal to an acute intestinal obstruction and decreased distally. Recordings from the entire small intestine revealed that these effects occurred almost immediately in the region of the obstruction but not at more distant sites. Within 2-3 h, however, proximal hypermotility had extended to the duodenum and distal inhibition had progressed to the terminal ileum. Diversion of intestinal contents without obstruction reduced myoelectric activity distal to the site of drainage. However, reinfusion of chyme distal to the site of obstruction failed to restore inhibited motor activity to control levels. Atropine sulfate (50 micrograms/kg) decreased and neostigmine (5 micrograms X kg-1 X min-1) potentiated the hyperactivity proximal to the obstruction, but neither agent significantly affected the distal inhibition. Phentolamine (1 mg/kg) and propranolol (1 mg/kg) had no effect on proximal or distal motor activity during obstruction; these were doses that blocked cardiovascular responses to adrenergic agonists. These results suggest that changes in luminal contents and in nervous activity both contribute to the intestinal motility changes that accompany obstruction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "The effect of a single oral dose of 50 mg of metoprolol on plasma catecholamine levels was examined in 11 healthy young men. Subjects were studied during baseline at rest, postural challenge, psychological stressors and graded maximal exercise testing. Metoprolol induced significant increases in plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels across most experimental conditions. Metoprolol did not have a consistent effect on plasma epinephrine levels. Because of wide interindividual variation in drug levels, the NE levels in subjects with high drug levels were compared with the NE levels in subjects who had negligible drug levels. NE levels were higher in subjects with higher drug levels.", 
    "50": "Twenty-six patients with an aortic root diameter greater than or equal to 3.7 cm by 2-dimensional echocardiography (2-D echo) were studied. Group I consisted of 14 patients (mean age 50 +/- 14 years) with idiopathic anuloaortic ectasia and group II consisted of 12 patients (mean age 60 +/- 12 years) with secondary causes of aortic root dilatation. Patients in group I had a significantly larger aortic root diameter at the level of the aortic valve (5.0 +/- 0.7 cm) and 2 cm above the aortic valve (5.3 +/- 1.2 cm) as assessed by echo than did patients in group II (4.1 +/- 0.3 and 4.4 +/- 0.4 cm, respectively, p less than 0.025). The diameter of descending thoracic aorta was slightly larger in patients in group II (3.1 +/- 0.8 vs 2.7 +/- 0.5 cm, difference not significant). Over a mean follow-up period of 18 months, in group I, aortic dissection developed in 3 patients and severe aortic regurgitation and congestive heart failure in 2; 7 patients had aortic root grafting, aortic valve replacement or both. The 3 patients in group I with aortic dissection had an aortic root diameter greater than or equal to 5.3 cm, but 4 asymptomatic patients also had a diameter greater than 5 cm. Only 1 patient in group II required surgery for aortic dissection. Thus, 2-D echo is useful in identifying and following high-risk patients with anuloaortic ectasia.", 
    "51": "Propylthiouracil (PTU) and propranolol can suppress, while methimazole (MMI) can enhance, mitogenic activation of lymphocytes. The present study investigated whether this effect of PTU, as has been shown for propranolol, relates to local anaesthetic activity. MMI (1 mM) but not PTU (1 mM) reduced the action potential in rat skeletal muscle. Thus, PTU seems to lack local anaesthetic activity. Moreover, the recorded local anaesthetic capacity of MMI hardly explains the stimulatory influence of MMI on lymphocyte activation. Apparently, the interference of MMI and PTU with lymphocyte activation seems to be due to another mechanism than local anaesthetic activity.", 
    "52": "Cardiac manifestations of hyperthyroidism have been attributed to enhanced sympathoadrenal activity, but thyroid hormones also have a direct positive chronotropic effect on sinoatrial cells, in which there are slow calcium channels. We evaluated the effects of verapamil on heart rate, PR and QT intervals, and blood pressure in eight patients with hyperthyroidism and compared them to those effects of propranolol. Three doses of propranolol (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg) and verapamil (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg) were injected intravenously after a 72-hr withdrawal period in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Propranolol increased the RR interval from 581 +/- 51 to 734 +/- 65 msec, whereas verapamil did not have any negative chronotropic effect despite prolonging the PR interval. Systolic blood pressure decreased from 134 +/- 5 to 119 +/- 8 mm Hg after verapamil and was not affected by propranolol. Diastolic blood pressure was depressed equally by both drugs. We conclude that verapamil is not a good alternative drug to propranolol in hyperthyroidism. Our data cannot confirm the possibility of an interaction between thyroid hormones and slow calcium channels in patients with hyperthyroidism.", 
    "53": "Patients on beta-blockers may experience a potentially harmful blood pressure rise after topical alpha-adrenoceptors such as phenylephrine. The presumed mechanism for this enhanced pressor responsiveness is unopposed alpha-adrenoceptor activity. This possibility has been investigated in 12 patients with hypertension by infusing increasing intravenous doses of phenylephrine after 2 wk on propranolol, metoprolol, or placebo within a randomized, double-blind, crossover study design. Mean (+/- SE) phenylephrine doses required to increase systolic blood pressure by 25 mm Hg were 4.8 +/- 0.7, 4.7 +/- 0.8, and 5.3 +/- 0.9 microgram/kg on propranolol, metoprolol, and placebo; these differences are not significant. Baroreceptor-mediated decreases in heart rate during phenylephrine infusion were in the same range, 15.8, 15.6, and 17.4 mm Hg on propranolol, metoprolol, and placebo, over baseline heart rate values. In these 12 patients with hypertension, beta-blockade did not induce any appreciable enhancement of alpha-adrenoceptor activity, suggesting that patients with hypertension who receive beta-blockers do not have enhanced pressor responsiveness.", 
    "54": "The ability to hydroxylate debrisoquine is known to be polymorphically distributed, with about 8% to 9% of the North American Caucasian population being poor metabolizers. We have shown that the ability to 4-hydroxylate propranolol is also polymorphically determined and that it cosegregates with ability to metabolize debrisoquine, such that poor debrisoquine metabolizers produce much less 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH propranolol) than do extensive metabolizers. There was no significant difference, however, between plasma propranolol concentrations after either single or multiple doses in the two groups. Despite the substantial difference in production of the pharmacologically active 4-OH metabolite, no difference was seen in the extent of beta-blockade induced in the extensive and poor metabolizers, which implies that 4-OH propranolol does not contribute substantially to beta-blockade.", 
    "55": "The specific airway conductance (sGaw) response of eight normal men to inhaled salbutamol, 200, 600, and 1800 micrograms, was measured on 3 separate days. On each occasion subjects received either placebo, long-acting propranolol (160 mg), or penbutolol (40 mg) orally in a double-blind manner after baseline lung function determination. After placebo, mean sGaw rose from a baseline of 2.07 +/- 0.15 to 2.81 +/- 0.25 kPa-1 X sec-1 after 200 micrograms salbutamol. There was little further airway dilation with higher doses of salbutamol. With long-acting propranolol, there was no significant airway dilation after 200 micrograms salbutamol but there was after 600 and 1800 micrograms inhaled salbutamol; baseline sGaw rose from 2.02 +/- 0.17 to 2.70 +/- 0.28 and 2.95 +/- 0.32 kPa-1 X sec-1. Penbutolol prevented any significant airway dilation with all doses of salbutamol. Penbutolol at the doses used appears to be a more potent blocker of beta 2-receptors than does propranolol.", 
    "56": "The hemodynamic dose-response effects of intravenous acebutolol, a cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were evaluated in 12 male subjects with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease. At rest after a saline solution control period, four doubling intravenous boluses of acebutolol (logarithmic cumulative dosage of 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg) were injected at 4-min intervals; hemodynamic variables were recorded 2 to 4 min after each injection. Hemodynamic effects of the drug during steady-state exercise were evaluated by comparison of a control exercise period with observations made at the same workload (25W to 50W) after the maximum cumulative dose (160 mg). After the four intravenous boluses, plasma acebutolol concentrations rose in log-linear fashion and levels achieved (0.6 to 3.5 micrograms/ml) were within the range at which substantial pharmacodynamic activity is usually present (i.e., 0.02 to 0.2 microgram/ml). Compared with control measurements at rest after saline solution injection, these plasma concentrations of acebutolol resulted in a quadratic reduction in heart rate (maximum delta HR, -4 bpm) and a linear increase in pulmonary artery occluded pressure (maximum delta PAOP, +3 mm Hg) without change in systemic arterial pressure. There was a small reduction in cardiac output (delta cardiac index [CI], -0.2 l/min/m2). During steady-state supine bicycle exercise, there were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (delta SBP, -15 mm Hg, or 9%) HR (-9 bpm or -9%), cardiac output (delta CI, -1.0 l/min/m2, or -18%), and increase in PAOP (+8 mm Hg, or +38%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The following three unusual complications of carotid endarterectomy developed in a 64-year-old woman: vascular headaches, delayed hypertension, and seizures. beta-Blockade with propranolol hydrochloride had no beneficial effect on either the hypertension or the headaches. Peripheral alpha-blockade with prazosin hydrochloride resulted in prompt improvement in the patient's condition. Altered autonomic vascular control secondary to carotid sinus trauma is proposed as a possible causative mechanism for all three complications. The therapeutic implications are discussed. Based on this experience, we would caution against the use of unopposed beta-blockade in this setting and suggest that the role of prazosin in the initial management of postendarterectomy hypertension and vascular headache be explored.", 
    "58": "The efficacy of acute beta blockade in essential hypertension is limited by reflex vasoconstriction. The aim of this study was to determine whether the latter response was modified by prior selective alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockade. A single-blind, within-patient, placebo-controlled evaluation of the immediate hemodynamic effects of sequential alpha-1 (trimazosin)- and beta (propranolol)-adrenoceptor blockade was undertaken in 10 men (34 to 58 years) with previously untreated essential hypertension. The study commenced with a 4-minute control period of constant-load (600 to 900 kpm/min) upright bicycle exercise, and measurements were made before (control) and 30 minutes after intravenous trimazosin (2 mg/kg) and exercise was then repeated; measurements at rest were again made 4 minutes after intravenous propranolol (0.2 mg/kg) before a final exercise period. Trimazosin at rest reduced systolic and diastolic arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance without change in heart rate, cardiac output, or left ventricular (LV) filling pressure. During upright bicycle exercise the reductions in blood pressure were sustained without change in their rest-to-exercise increments. Other circulatory variables did not differ from control values. At rest the addition of propranolol further reduced systolic arterial pressure. Heart rate and cardiac output fell and systemic vascular resistance increased to its pretreatment control value. During exercise the changes at rest were sustained and the rest-to-exercise increments in blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output were reduced. LV filling pressure was significantly increased. In conclusion, alpha-1-adrenoceptor blockade modified the adverse effects of acute beta blockade at rest but not during exercise.", 
    "59": "Circadian systems are intermodulated by networks of specialized neural, hormonal and cellular functions, with time structures that are interdependent. In cardiovascular pathophysiology, circadian and ultradian rhythms of clinical interest have been demonstrated. Cardiac output, heart rate, arterial pressure and blood volume are the best known. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate have circadian patterns in health and therefore arterial pressure cannot be evaluated by a single measurement during a 24-h span. With correct monitoring for at least 48-h it is possible to detect the mesor-hypertension and the possible amplitude-hypertension that precedes the mesor-hypertension. Prolonged elevation of blood pressure can cause irreparable harm to sensitive tissues. To quantify the damage, the concept of hyperbaric impact has been introduced. This is a measure of the excess load exerted upon the arterial walls. Studies of the beta-blocker penbutolol with correct automatic monitoring have shown the persistence of the physiological circadian variation in the cardiovascular parameters during penbutolol administration. The so-called elimination of the circadian rhythm in blood pressure, which would not really be desirable, was not seen in any of our patients, whose cardiovascular parameters were monitored continuously, day and night, while taking penbutolol. The amplitudes of the rhythms were always prominent. A phase shift, a delay of about 100 degrees, was demonstrated in the heart rate of one 63-year-old mesor-normotensive woman.", 
    "60": "Using more than 500 rabbits, we found that the rabbit heart is a good model for the evaluation of drugs which affect acute myocardial infarction (AMI) size. When the ratio of the epicardial coloration area to the long axis length of the left ventricle was controlled immediately after the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery and small branches of the left circumflex artery, it was possible to estimate the size of the ischemic region because AMI region in rabbit heart was always transmural. The necrotic region in the left ventricle was determined by phosphorylase histochemistry 24 hours after the operation. The incidence of arrhythmia and death following the operation was negligible. Then, we evaluated several drugs to examine their effects on AMI size. Propranolol (1, 2, and 4 mg/Kg) and verapamil (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/Kg) reduced AMI size, although the mortality and AMI size increased at higher doses of verapamil. Another Ca2+ antagonist, diltiazem (2 mg/Kg) and an adenosine potentiator, dilazep (2 mg/Kg) also decreased AMI size, while nicardipine, a water soluble, photoresistant nifedipine analogue (0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/Kg) did not show a significant effect. These data suggest that this rabbit model is useful for assessing drug effects on AMI size and that the mechanism(s) of action of nicardipine may differ from other Ca2+ antagonists.", 
    "61": "The effects of the (+/-)-, (+)- and (-)-forms of propranolol, timolol and metoprolol on noradrenergic transmission have been studied in the rat isolated right ventricle. (+)- And (-)-propranolol (10(-5) M) inhibited the accumulation of radioactivity from [3H]-noradrenaline. The decline in the spontaneous outflow of radioactivity, following loading of the tissue with [3H]-noradrenaline, was reduced by (+)- and (-)-propranolol (10(-5) M), (+)-timolol (10(-5) M), (-)-timolol (10(-6) - 10(-5) M) and (+)-metoprolol (10(-5) M). (+)-Propranolol, (+)-timolol (10(-6) M) and (+)- and (-)-metoprolol (10(-5) M) increased the decline in outflow of radioactivity evoked by field stimulation in the absence, but not in the presence, of lignocaine (10(-4) M), probably by decreasing nerve excitability. The ability of (-)-propranolol (10(-5) M) to increase the decline in evoked outflow was also reduced in the presence of lignocaine. (+)-Propranolol, (+)-timolol and (-)-metoprolol reduced the contractile response to field stimulation by a similar percentage in the absence or presence of lignocaine. The ability of (-)-propranolol and (+)-metoprolol (10(-5) M) to reduce contractile responses was decreased and abolished, respectively, by the addition of lignocaine. Evoked-outflow was not altered but contractile responses were inhibited by (-)-timolol (10(-7) - 10(-5) M) and (-)-metoprolol (10(-5) M). Contractile responses to isoprenaline were not altered by (+)-propranolol, (+)-timolol (10(-7) M) and (+)-metoprolol (10(-7) - 10(-6) M). (+)- Or (-)-propranolol (10(-7) M) and (+)-timolol (10(-6) M) had no effect on the rate of beating to isoprenaline but reduced the force whereas (+/-)-metoprolol (10(-7) M) had no effect on the force but reduced the rate of beating. The rate of beating and force responses to isoprenaline were reduced by (+/-)-, (+)-, (-)-propranolol (10(-6) M), (+/-)- or (-)-timolol (10(-7) - 10(-6) M), (+/-)-metoprolol (10(-6) M) and (-)-metoprolol (10(-7) - 10(-6) M). The data suggest that, in the rat isolated right ventricle, the (+)-isomers are active constituents of (+/-)-propranolol and (+/-)-timolol but not of (+/-)-metoprolol.", 
    "62": "The central nervous system effects of bombesin on cardiovascular function were examined in conscious, freely-moving rats. Intracerebroventricular administration of bombesin elevated mean arterial pressure, reduced heart rate and inhibited cold-induced tachycardia. Adrenalectomy prevented bombesin-induced elevations of mean arterial pressure. In contrast, bombesin-induced bradycardia was neither adrenal-dependent nor a baroreceptor-mediated reflex response to increased arterial pressure. Systemic atropine methyl nitrate treatment attenuated bombesin-induced bradycardia, suggesting that bombesin acts within the central nervous system to stimulate cardiac vagal activity.", 
    "63": "Antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects of propranolol and sotalol were examined by studying their action on cellular electrical activity (recorded using standard microelectrode techniques) and creatine-kinase leakage (measured in the effluent from the experimental bath chamber) in the in vitro guinea-pig left ventricular myocardium exposed to conditions mimicking severe or moderate ischemia. Returning the tissue to the normal conditions was considered as equivalent to ischemic-heart reperfusion. Propranolol (2 X 4 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to guinea-pigs, daily for 21 days. It was perfused in vitro (1.10(-6) M) during the whole experiments. Propranolol decreased action potential duration in control conditions (p less than 0,05), precipitated the occurrence of inexcitability during severe ischemia (p less than 0,01) and improved the recovery of cellular excitability during reperfusion. Propranolol did not significantly affect the creatine-kinase leakage during ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "64": "The study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of beta 1 adrenoceptor blocking agent, metoprolol, on water drinking activity in Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Both 7 day (10mg/kg/day) oral administration of metoprolol and propranolol did not produce any changes in the systolic blood pressure of WKY. However, metoprolol produced a significant decrease in heart rate in WKY. Neither the propranolol treated rats nor the control (non-drug group) rats showed any significant changes in heart rate. Heart rates were significantly changed in the metoprolol group as compared with the other two groups. This finding reconfirms that metoprolol has beta 1 selectivity. Drinking activity, an indicator of central nervous function, did not change after metoprolol administration. Power spectral analysis of water drinking activity did not reveal any changes in rhythm in respect to periodicity in the metoprolol group. Although water drinking activity is synchronized with urinary catecholamine and aldosterone excretion rates, urinary catecholamine and aldosterone excretion rates did not change after metoprolol administration. These findings suggest that it is the beta 1 adrenergic blocking action of a bradycardia-producing dose of metoprolol that prevented any change in water drinking behavior in WKY.", 
    "65": "Thirty patients with essential hypertension, whose blood pressure was controlled by metoprolol, were divided according to age in two groups. All the patients were treated with long-acting metoprolol given as simple daily dose at 08.00 h. Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded before and at the 7th, 15th, 30th, 45th, 60th days of treatment. No significant difference in the antihypertensive effects of metoprolol was detected between the two groups of patients. A significantly higher reduction of the heart rate was observed in the older patients.", 
    "66": "The incorporation of small amounts of acid anhydrides into hydrophobic poly(ortho ester)s can facilitate the erosion and drug release from delivery systems. Since the reaction can be controlled by the amount of anhydride employed, the reaction is confined to a small reaction zone near the surface and constant delivery rates can be achieved. The catalytic activity is negatively correlated with the pKa of the corresponding acid of the anhydride.", 
    "67": "Clinical trials are used to test drug therapy but the principles of a trial may be applied to the assessment of any treatment (although the essential formality of a trial might confuse and irritate a general practitioner involved as a participant or reader of results). This is the first of two articles which aim to reconcile the theory of formal clinical trials and the practice of medicine.", 
    "68": "The effect of capsaicin injected into the superior mesenteric artery has been studied on the intestinal blood flow in dogs. Capsaicin evoked a marked dose-dependent increase in mesenterial blood flow in the dose range of 0.1-7 micrograms/kg. The intestinal vasodilatatory effect of capsaicin could invariably be demonstrated after pretreatment with adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor antagonists, as well as with the ganglion blocking agent hexamethonium. Pretreatment with atropine significantly reduced, but did not abolish the increase in intestinal blood flow elicited by capsaicin. Concomitant administration of somatostatin significantly inhibited both the atropine-sensitive and the atropine-resistant components of the effect of capsaicin injected into the superior mesenteric artery. Our results indirectly support the assumption that the intestinal vasodilatatory effect of capsaicin may be mediated by substance P release from capsaicin-sensitive paravascular nerve fibres associated with the blood vessels of the gastrointestinal tract. It is suggested that sensory substance P-containing nerve fibres may be involved in the regulation of the vascular reactions of the gut.", 
    "69": "A study was made of the effect of the MAO inhibitor iprazide (50 mg/kg), alpha-methyldopa (150 mg/kg), and the beta-adrenoblocker inderal (15 mg/kg) on the rate of the healing of gastric mucosa erosions and noradrenaline content in the gastric wall of rats exposed to 3 hours of electric stimulation and immobilization. Iprazide accelerated the reparation of the gastric mucosa, alpha-methyldopa retarded it, whereas inderal did not influence that process. The drugs did not affect the rate of the recovery of noradrenaline content.", 
    "70": "The effects of acute exposure to noise on central and regional (calf and forearm) haemodynamics were studied during placebo therapy and during combined nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade and precapillary vasodilatation in 9 patients with essential hypertension. On placebo therapy a loud noise (105 dBA for 10 min) caused a significant increase in diastolic and mean arterial pressure due to vasoconstriction. There was also a significant increase of vascular resistance in the calf. After combined precapillary vasodilatation and non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blockade, the increase in blood pressure during stimulation with noise was not prevented. Thus, systolic as well as diastolic and mean arterial pressures increased significantly. This indicates a temporary resetting of the baroreceptors, allowing a higher level of blood pressure during stimulation with noise. Such a resetting would involve the central nervous system pathways of the baroreflex and this would explain why the peripherally active therapeutic principle--precapillary vasodilatation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade--was unable to inhibit the blood pressure response induced by noise.", 
    "71": "The short-term influence of catecholamines on surface pH (pHs) and intracellular pH (pHi) of superficial muscle fibres has been investigated in rat soleus in vitro using single-barrelled and double-barrelled glass micro-electrodes. pHs means the pH recorded at the surface of a muscle fibre. All measurements were performed in high-Ca2+ (10 mM) Ringer's solutions. Adrenaline caused an intracellular and surface acidification which increased with concentration in the range 6 X 10(-9)-6 X 10(-6) M. The effect was inhibited by propranolol (10(-5)M) but not by phentolamine (1.5 X 10(-7) M). Noradrenaline and isoproterenol (6 X 10(-6) M) also acidified the intracellular fluid. The relative effect of catecholamines on steady-state pHi was: adrenaline = isoproterenol greater than noradrenaline. Adrenaline (6 X 10(-9)-6 X 10(-6) M) did not accelerate pHi recovery following intracellular acid-loading by NH+4 or CO2. It is concluded that activation of beta-adrenoceptors by catecholamines causes an early intracellular acidosis presumably by enhancing synthesis of metabolic acids. The surface acidification seems at least partly due to non-ionic permeation of sarcolemma by metabolic acids, secondarily inducing accumulation of H+ ions at the cell surface.", 
    "72": "Adrenergic-sensitive adenylate cyclase was found to be present in the nucleus accumbens and ventral caudate of the rabbit, but displayed less activity in the dorsal caudate. In general, stimulation of the enzyme by dopamine (DA) was most sensitive to inhibition by fluphenazine while norepinephrine (NE)-stimulated activity was highly sensitive to both fluphenazine and propranolol. Other selective adrenergic-receptor blocking agents (butoxamine, practolol, yohimbine and prazosine) were more effective in antagonizing the effect of NE as opposed to DA-activation. Activation of adenylate cyclase by NE in the dorsal caudate displayed less sensitivity to these adrenergic antagonists than in the other two areas. Horseradish peroxidase-positive cells were present in the locus coeruleus, following injection into the nucleus accumbens. Activity of basal and guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-sensitive adenylate cyclase was reduced by enkephalins in these three brain regions. This action was reversed by naloxone. Met-enkephalin did not affect either NE- or DA-mediated responses in any area.", 
    "73": "A sensitive and simplified high-performance liquid chromatographic procedure was developed for the simultaneous quantification of metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol in human serum, as well as cerebrospinal fluid and urine. Following protein precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the sample was alkalinized with 1 M NaOH and extracted with dichloromethane. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-water (50:50) containing 0.005 M 1-heptanesulfonic acid in 0.001% acetic acid. Using pronetalol as an internal standard, compounds were quantitated using fluorescence detection at 230 nm with a 300-nm emission filter and 0.02 AUFS. Extraction recovery is approximately 80% for both compounds. The lower limits of detection are 5 ng/mL and 4 ng/mL for metoprolol and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol, respectively.", 
    "74": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerance of a new fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol and 12.5 mg chlorthalidone (Tenoretic Mite, TM) was studied in 37 patients with arterial hypertension, aged 61-80 years (mean, 70.2 years), who had been randomized to either 50 mg atenolol or 12.5 mg chlorthalidone for a 4-week period. At the end of this period, the fixed combination of atenolol and chlorthalidone was given to all patients for 6 months at a dose of one tablet daily in the morning. In both atenolol- and chlorthalidone-pretreated patients, treatment with the fixed combination resulted in a further significant drop in blood pressure, whereas the heart rate decreased only in the latter group. The mean blood pressure reduction achieved by the fixed combination was 30/15 mmHg in the standing position. Serum potassium levels significantly increased with the fixed combination compared with values on chlorthalidone alone. Unwanted effects were rare, and their frequency tended to decrease over time. In conclusion, the fixed combination of 50 mg atenolol plus 12.5 mg chlorthalidone tested in this study proved highly effective in lowering elevated blood pressure values in a population of elderly hypertensive patients treated over a 6-month period without noticeable unwanted effects.", 
    "75": "An open randomized study involving 57 subjects, 40 euthyroid and 17 hyperthyreotic, was undertaken to compare the effect of two beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, propranolol (120 mg/day) and acebutolol (600 mg/day), on the thyroid hormones serum level. In hyperthyreotic as well as in euthyroid subjects, propranolol evoked a fall in T3, an increase in reverse T3 and therefore a decrease in the T3/rT3 ratio. Acebutolol caused a decrease in T3 and in the T3/rT3 ratio only in euthyroid subjects. The only significant variation in the hyperthyroid acebutolol treated group was a decrease in reverse T3, perhaps spontaneous. TBG and TSH concentrations remained stable under treatment in all the groups. The relation of these effects with the existence of a membrane stabilizing activity displayed by propranolol as well as by acebutolol is discussed.", 
    "76": "The authors performed a comprehensive study of the recovery processes in the myocardium after occlusion of the coronary artery in 126 white rats under the effect of a long-term treatment with propranolol (0.5 mg/kg). The drug reduced the size of necrosis by 2.6 times, significantly decreased the S-T segment rise on the ECG (up to 0.86 +/- 0.09 mV versus 1.85 +/- 0.15 mV, in untreated animals with myocardial infarction, P less than 0.001). The treated animals manifested the improvement of the morphologic status of the perinecrotic area and the myocardium of the posterior wall of the left ventricle. Cardiomyocytes preserved to a considerable degree the ultrastructure of the mitochondria, demonstrating an increase in DK and protein biosynthesis (up to 296.1%, P less than 0.001). At the same time the long-term treatment with propranolol led to an appreciable activation of intracellular reparative regeneration, acceleration of the renewal of organelles, thereby promoting a decrease in the hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes (by 22.1%, P less than 0.001) as compared with control. It is concluded that propranolol administered in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg favours rapid recovery of the functional structures of the myocardium.", 
    "77": "Two experiments assessed the effects of various noradrenergic agents on selective attention. Selective attention was operationally defined as blocking of a conditioned odor aversion by prior conditioning to spatial cues. In Experiment 1, there was a trend for such blocking to increase developmentally. In addition, the administration of isoproterenol prior to training tended to facilitate the demonstration of blocking in adolescent rats and reduced it in adult subjects. In Experiment 2, administration of yohimbine or propranolol prior to training also reduced blocking in adult subjects; however, the concomitant administration of these two drugs restored blocking in adult rats. These results were interpreted to support a model relating an optimal level of noradrenergic activity in the dorsal bundle and selective attention.", 
    "78": "The purpose of this study was to investigate hypothalamic dopaminergic activity in pregnant women after the administration of metoclopramide (MCP), a dopamine receptor blocker, and to investigate the effects of MCP on the placental steroid and peptide hormones, and to clarify the prolactin (PRL) releasing mechanism in the hypothalamo-pituitary axis during pregnancy using dopaminergic agents and TRH. The following results were obtained. The plasma PRL levels following intravenous MCP remained significantly elevated for 180 minutes (p less than 0.001-0.05) in all groups as compared to the control group, but there were no significant differences between early and late pregnant groups, and between pregnant and nonpregnant groups. Therefore, the dopaminergic activity of the hypothalamus remained unchanged during pregnancy as well as in the nonpregnant state. The administration of MCP or a sudden increase in plasma PRL had no effect on the maternal plasma estradiol-17 beta, progesterone, HCG or HPL during pregnancy. PRL release from the pituitary by MCP was suppressed significantly (p less than 0.01) by pretreatment with bromocriptine. PRL releasing activity of MCP 10mg was significantly higher (p less than 0.01-0.05) than that of TRH 500 micrograms in the pregnant women."
